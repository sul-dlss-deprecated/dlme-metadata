British interests in A rabistan at the close of the last century. KHAZAL KHAN succeeded, at the age of 36, to the Sheikhdom of Mohammerah on the murder of his elder brother, Mizal Khan, on the 2nd June, 1897. At that time British policy in Persia was governed, as it has invariably been since, by inter-acting strategic and economic considerations. In the strategic field, the basic consideration was the defence of India, and this involved watching and countering Russian political and economic thrusts from the north; to this end the British Government pursued a policy of strengthening the weak buffer State while also endeavouring to build up a position in the south so as not to be caught at a disadvantage should that buffer State disintegrate. British defence schemes, based as they were on naval power, made the Persian Gulf a region of great strategic importance to India, and therefore to this country, and it was necessary to watch the activities not only of Russia but also of Germany and Turkey, in that region. An essential part of British policy in the Gulf was the establish ment of good relations and the conclusion of treaties with the various Arab rulers, and the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, controlling territory at the head of the Gulf, thus came very prominently into the general scheme. In the economic field also, although the days of the d'Arcy concession and the Anglo-Persian Oil Companv had not yet arrived, British and Indian interests were considerable : Mohammerah was a port of call for British India Steam Navigation Company’s vessels, a British Indian post office had been established there, a British firm (Messrs. ^ Lynch) controlled the only non-Persian navigation service on the River Karun (which had been opened to'navigation in 1888) and British interests were concerned in various road and railway projects in Arabistan. 2. The Sheikhs of Mohammerah. who were chiefs of the Muhaisin division of the the Chaab Arabs, were nominally Persian subjects, but they enjoyed in Arabistan a large measure of autonomy and semi-independence in the administra tion of their territories. The latter, which derived from hereditary occupation, extended beyond Ahwaz and generally covered almost the whole of southern Arabistan, while, in addition, the Sheikhs had large interests to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab in what was recognised as Turkish territory—including the allegiance of members of their own tribe engaged in cultivation there. The British Government had established friendly relations with Sheikh Jabir of of Mohammerah and had supported him after the Anglo-Persian war of 1857, and these relations were continued after the accession of his son Mizal Khan to the sheikhdom in 1881; later, however, owing to his annoyance at the competition of Messrs. Lynch with himself in the carrying trade on the Karun and at actions of the British Vice-Consul at Mohammenah in appealing to Persian authorities against his proceedings, and also owing to his fear of incurring the distrust of the Persian Government, MizaTs relations with the British deteriorated. In 1895, when disaffection towards Mizal became rife among his own tribesmen, Khazal Khan, whose accession to the sheikhdom began to appear probable assured the British Vice-Consul that his political salvation lay in assisting and not opposing the British and that if. as Sheikh, he should be called upon to choose a policy, it would be one of sincere friendship with the British Government,^ although political exigencies might dictate concealment of its real nature. Early British assurances to the Sheikh, 1899—1903. 3. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal, guided by his principal adviser, the shrewd and able Hadji Mohamed Ali Behbehani, Rais-et-Tujjar, pursued a policy of strengthening his rule both around Mohammerah and in other districts to which his family had traditional claims and of seeking to establish his position vis-a-vis of the Persian Government. The negotiations with the Central Govern ment at Tehran were in the hands of the Rais-et-Tujjar and the British Legation assisted with their advice. Eventually, in 1903, the Sheikh received firmans from the Shah which recognised as “perpetual properties the lands of the Sheikh and his tribes at Mohammerah, Abadan Island Bahmanshir, ^arun, Hindvan, Dehmulla and Fallahiyeh; these firmans stipulated that the Sheikh should pay only the usual annual revenues to the Persian Government and that the latter should have no right to take possession of, or interfere with, the properties (or alternatively, if they should acquire them, should pay a reasonable price to the Sheikh); there was also a stipulation (which became important later in connexion with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession) that the proper ties must not be sold or transferred to foreigners, but there was no ban on their being leased.3 4. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal lost no time in again informing His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah of his friendship for the British Govern ment and of his desire to serve them, and in November, 1898, alarmed at the course of his discussions with the Persian Government, he expressed the wish to be taken secretly under British protection; he did not press for a written assurance, nor did he ask for an alliance against the Persian Government, whom he professed to have served faithfully and whom he would continue to serve, but he thought the British Government should not allow his influence to be diminished by the Persian Government. Later he informed the British Resident in the Persian Gulf that he apprehended an early downfall of the Persian monarchy, followed by a general scramble and partition of the kingdom, in which case he was anxious that his lot should be thrown in with the British Government. Acting on instructions from the British Minister at Tehran, the Political Resident informed the Sheikh in May, 1899, to the following effect:— We could not, of course, undertake to maintain the Sheikh against the Persian Government, nor could we say that, if the latter were to break up, we could guarantee his independence; the British Government did not con template such an contingency; but we regarded him as the most influential person in this part of the world and we intended as far as possible to support him, believing that it was in the interest of the country that he should be strong; if ever he wanted our advice we would give it; in return we expected that he would help us in matters of trade, &amp;c.; he could rely upon our goodwill at all times, and upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government. 5. In 1902, as a result of expressed fears of Russia, the Sheikh pressed for additional and written assurances, and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in the knowledge that a Russian consular officer was to be appointed in Arabistan (where Russian trade was non-existent), and in view of the possibility that the Sheikh might turn to the Russians for support, urged that something should be done to instil into the Sheikh real confidence in the strength and resolution of His Majesty’s Government. In the result, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 1 in the annex), assuring him that we would protect Mohammerah against naval attack by any foreign Power (whatever might be alleged as pretext for such action) and, also, as long as he remained faithful to the Shah and acted according to our advice, we should continue to give him our good offices and support. Prior to the despatch of this letter, His Majesty’s Minister informed the Grand Vizier orally that he had no wish to call in question the Shah’s sovereignty over the Sheikh and his people, which His Majesty’s Govern ment had always recognised; but His Majesty’s Government were determined to support the Sheikh against attempts by Russian agents to intimidate him or to insinuate that they could bring pressure to bear on him owing to the influence which Russia exercised at Tehran. (His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in the matter was subsequently made clear in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) 6. In December, 1903, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran proceeded to the Persian Gulf to meet the Viceroy, and on his return journey was visited by Sheikh Khazal at Mohammerah. The Sheikh then complained that the Persian Government were not abiding by their undertakings given in the previous year, both as regards the administration of Customs at Mohammerah and the payment of Customs duties by himself, and that they were attempting graduallv to pare away his authority and destroy the prestige on which it rested. He contrasted the measure of support which he obtained from His Majesty’s Govern ment with that accorded by them to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, and asked whether His Majesty’s Government would now give him a definite promise of support in the event of the Persian Government’s repudiating the bargain they had made with him. In the course of this conversation the Sheikh mentioned that the Russians were quite prepared to give him promises of protection, and Sir A. Hardinge thought it not improbable that, if we withheld our support from him, he might enter into some secret arrangement with them. After consulta tion with the Foreign Office and the Government of India, Sir A Hardinge addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 24th December, 1903, statin^ that the latter might rest assured of the support of the British Government so lono- as he, on his own side, observed 1 the conditions of the arrangement made with°the Persian Government; the text of this letter is reproduced as document No 2 in the annex. The reply of the Sheikh to this letter was given orally on his behalf [32557] * B 2 LoriiBer's Gazetteer, Vol. I, pp 17H et seq. Conf. 10039. Conf. 8215, Nos. 222. 237 Ditto, No. 406. Ditto, No. 406.

Later in the year, however, the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Sheikh was chafing at the difficulties and uncertainty of his relations with, and position undter, the Shah’s Government, and was at heart dissatisfied at the limited measure of support which the British Government had been able to promise him. Renewals and Amplification of British Assurances, 1908-10. 7. In the years following the British assurances, Sheikh Khazal appears to have suffered little serious interference from the central Government, who, in their weakness and in the chaotic situation in the country generally, appear to have been content to allow the Sheikh to rule undisturbed over his territories : in fact, the Sheikh actually complained to His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah in October, 1907, that, while the Persian press and the Majlis were attacking him on various counts, he was being left to his own resources in policing the Shatt-el-Arab and suppressing disorders amongst the Persian tribes. He expressed a similar view to the British Resident in January, 1908, complaining that he was left to defend the frontier against Turkey, and had to meet heavy expenditure which should have been borne by the central Government; (actually, although Turkey was making trouble further north, she had not extended such ^ activities to the Sheikh’s territories). 8. At the meeting with Major (afterwards Sir Percy) Cox in January, 1908, the Sheikh, influenced partly by recent assurances given to the Sheikh of Koweit (with whom he was on terms of close friendship) and by the advent of constitu tional government in Persia, raised again the question of the British assurances, saying that it was vital for him to know what would be the policy of His Majesty’s Government, as far as he was concerned, in the event of {a) the break-up of Persia, or (b) an attempt by the Majlis (as opposed to the former absolute govern ment of the Shah) “ to reduce him to nothing ”; he asked for an assurance in writing which should apply not only to himself but to his heirs, in return for which he offered to bind himself to the British Government in any way considered feasible. In reporting this conversation, the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was primarily sincere in his protestations that his hopes and interests were centred on the British Government, but that he was never theless mainly prompted by the dictates of self-preservation and that, failing satisfaction from us, he might turn to the Germans for support. The Foreign Office took the view that the Sheikh, by reason of the geographical situation of his possessions and by his considerable local influence, was in a position to hinder, or even prevent, the prosecution of any foreign enterprise in the country watered by the Karun, and that it was very desirable to secure his absolute adherence to British interests in order to ensure that his power might always be exercised in their favour by opposing any schemes which might be distasteful to His Majesty’s Government; they were, therefore, disposed to repeat the previous assurances, applying them to the Sheikh’s successor and amplifying them by a form of words which would include the continuance of the Sheikh’s existing state of autonomy. 9. After consultation with the Government of India, the Political Resident received instructions to address a written assurance to the Sheikh, which he did in a letter of the 1st December, 1908, the text of which is given as document No. 3 in the annex. 10. These renewed and amplified assurances failed to satisfy the Sheikh, who, in March, 1909, complained to the Political Resident that they safeguarded him only as long as Persia remained a sovereign State; he wished the guarantee to be extended in such a manner as to make it effective in the event of Persia’s being occupied by foreign Powers or ceasing to be an independent State as a result of foreign intervention; above all he wanted an assurance to the effect that, provided he and his heirs and tribesmen continued to show themselves amenable to British advice and faithful to British interests, their possessions would be guaranteed to them. In addition, he asked for advice whether to side with the Royalists or Nationalists, both of which parties had been calling upon him to throw in his lot with them, declaring that he must inevitably take one side or the other and expressing his fear that, if he came to a decision without our advice, we might withdraw our guarantee on the ground that his decision was unsatisfactory to us. Lastly, he appealed for a loan, saying that, if we could6 do nothing for him, we must not object to his applying elsewhere; (hints of the establishment of relations with other Powers, were, as has been seen, part of his stock bargaining assets). 11. As regards the proposed loan, neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Government of India w T ere at first anxious themselves to make an advance to the Sheikh, who, however, showed his hand by obtaining a loan of £1,000 from the German firm, Wonckhaus and Company. Details of the subsequent discussions need not here be given, but eventually it was arranged that His Majesty’s Government should advance a sum of £10,000, the amount actually being furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who, by an agreement signed with the Sheikh on the 16th July, 1909, secured the lease of valuable sites on Abadan island and elsewhere. It may be mentioned also that two months earlier assurances had been obtained from the Sheikh regarding prior British rights in irrigation projects on the Karun and other rivers in his territories. 12. The request of the Sheikh for advice as to the action he should take vis-a-vis of the Royalists and Nationalists was met by the recommendation not to involve himself in Persian party politics. As regards the Sheikh’s desire for further assurances, the Political Resident had several conversations with the Sheikh, to whom he eventually addressed a letter on the 16th May, 1909 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 4 in the Annex)! The new assurances were in the following words :— I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might j* take place in the form of government in Persia, the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your ‘ heirs and successors.’ ” 13. The Sheikh was still not satisfied and in discussions with the Political Resident stated that he wished the assurances to be made applicable for a period of 100 years to his male descendants rather than to his “ heirs and successors.” The reason for the request to extend the assurances to his male descendants was that he feared that his nephew Hanzal might seize some favourable opportunitv to effect his own (Khazal s) or his eldest son’s (Chassib s) assassination and usurp the sheikhdom; and that for a stated period was that he feared that at some future date the British Government might find it necessary to intervene in Southern Persia and perhaps find it convenient to take over Mohammerah, when he might lose his privileges and revenues—in which case he would like an under taking that he would continue to enjoy his personal revenue and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere. Finally, he asked for a form of written assurances which he could show to his tribesmen to quiet their apprehensions and to strengthen their support of himself and their faith in the friendlv policy of the Britisn Government. 14. There was considerable delay before fresh assurances were given to the Sheikh, who, for a number of reasons, was becoming anxious as to his position. In the first place he was concerned at the growing influence at Tehran of the ^JBakhtiari Minister of the Interior, Sardar Assad, who was hostile to himself, and early in 1910 Sheikh Khazal was speaking of intervention in Persian politics; he was, however, told that his best policy was to continue his allegiance to the Central Government, to whom he should submit any grievances, and that His Majesty’s Legation would support him if he were refused satisfaction. The Sheikh expressed his readiness to comply with this advice but wished in return for an assurance of protection against the Bakhtiari; this, however, His Majesty’s Government considered both unnecessary and undesirable. 15. Later in the year matters were complicated bv the action of the Vali of Basra, who, because of alleged actions of the Sheikh’s followers in Turkish territory and of the Sheikh’s refusal to surrender one of his tribal chiefs (of Persian nationality), sent a gun-boat which shelled one of the Sheikh’s villages on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. The Sheikh, who expressed his readi ness to raise his whole territory against the Turks, was, however, prepared to be guided by His Majesty’s Government in this matter, and the latter found themselves in a position of having to implement their assurances against attack from a foreign Power. While holding a warship in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah if necessary, they found it possible to safeguard the Sheikh’s position without resorting to hostilities; it was, however, deemed desirable to counteract a certain amount of loss of prestige suffered by the Sheikh and also to make a demonstration in face of the growth of Turkish ambitions in the Conf. 9540, No. 435.

The presentation of the insignia took place with due ceremony at the Sheikh’s palace at Failiyah on the loth Octoher, 1910. In his speech the Political Resident referred to His Majesty's Government’s good-will and esteem and to their appreciation of the Sheikn's sustained efforts to preserve order and security for trade in the districts under his control. In his reply, the Sheikh spoke of the friendship between the Persian and British Governments and of his hopes that he might be able to render service and devotion to the former and to earn the approval of the latter. As regards the assurances, the Political Resi dent addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 15th October, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 5 in the Annex, and also another in identic terms (except for the omission of the words “ to be acceptable to your tribesmen ”) which the Sheikh could show, if necessary, to the headmen of the tribes under his control. The written assurances were accompanied by an important oral statement by the Political Resident, in the presence of His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah and the Rais-et-Tujjar, to the effect that the Sheikh must under stand that circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to intervene by force on his behalf. The Sheikh replied ^ that he quite understood this and that it was sufficient for him to know that His Majesty’s Government really meant to safeguard him to the best of their ability in case of emergency. Thus ended a long chapter, to which need be added only the fact that in the following December the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to His Majesty’s Minister on the subject of the Sheikh, saying that information had been received that the latter was under British protection: to this Sir G. Barclay replied that the Sheikh was not a British protected person but that His Majesty’s Government had special relations with him, and that, in the event of any encroachment on his rights, he would receive their support ; the text of the assurances were not, however, communicated to the Persian Government. The Assurances of 1914. 17. In December, 1913 (at a time when His Majesty’s Government were contemplating the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), the Sheikh asked Sir Percy Cox for further assurances on the following lines :— (a) that we should make the position regarding the succession more secure by a modification of the existing assurances; (b) that we would take cognisance of a definite peace compact between the Sheikh and the Bakhtiaris which would render him immune from the necessity and expense of protecting his territory against their aggression; and (c) that we should endeavour to devise and take measures with the Persian Government to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which the history of the past entitled him and which he was then enjoying in practice, although on a precarious basis. These matters were still under discussion by His Majesty’s Government when the outbreak of war in 1914 transformed the situation; the disintegration of Persia and the encroachment of Russia, which had previously been the main pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, were eclipsed by the more immediate menace from Germany and Turkey, and it was regarded as clearly essential that we should reaffirm and strengthen our assurances to the Sheikh, who, there was reason to believe, was ready to act in collusion with the Sheikh of Koweit, with Ibn Saud and with certain notables of Basra, in preparing the way for a peaceful British occupation of that port. The Government of India now recommended that the former assurances should be reaffirmed and strengthened and that, in addition, we should undertake to maintain the Sheikh in secure and untaxed possession of his date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. 18. On the 3rd November, 1914 (i.e. y before the formal announcement by His Majesty’s Government on the 5th November that a state of war existed with Turkey but at a time when hostilities had actually commenced), Colonel Knox,the acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, addressed a letter to the feheikh containing the revised assurances. The text of this letter need not be reproduced here because it mentioned the co-operation to be expected from the Sheikh in the capture of Basra, and, as the question of such co-operation did not actually arise, the Sheikh, after the capture of Basra, asked for a revised letter from which the passages relating thereto should be omitted. Sir P. Cox therefore addressed to him a new letter bearing the date the 22nd November, 1914 (i.e., that on which Basra was occupied by British forces), which became the master document, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 6 in the annex. The War Period. 19. It may be recorded briefly that the Sheikh was of positive assistance to His Majesty’s Government during the war, largely by his maintenance of order in that part of Persia where British interests were so considerable. This was particu larly the case in 1915 when certain unruly tribes under his jurisdiction, incited by the preaching of a jehad by Turkish agents, rose in revolt and assisted the Turks in an attack on British troops at Ahwaz and in cutting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s pipe line; on that occasion the Sheikh did much to facilitate the rapid restitution of order as soon as the Turks had been driven back. Towards the end of 1915, when it appeared probable for a time that Persia would intervene in the war on the side of the enemy, there was some discussion of recognising the Sheikh’s independence in that event, but, as the emergency never in fact occurred, Sir P. Cox’s letter of the 22nd November, 1914, remained the final embodiment of His Majesty’s Government’s commitments to the Sheikh. The Post-War Period, 1919-20. 20. The end of hostilities in Europe and in the Ottoman Empire brought little improvement in the state of Persia, which continued to exercise His Majesty’s Government. The danger from Germany and Turkey was now removed but that from Russia was revived in a new form—Bolshevism. The Sheikh’s territories, by contrast, remained generally quiet, to the benefit of British interests which had grown enormously. Although order was maintained in the Sheikh’s territories, this was achieved only by autocratic and oppressive rule and the Sheikh was no longer a popular ruler. He maintained his control of the tribes by a policy of breaking the power of any sheikh or tribe likely to become too strong and a danger to his rule, replacing the suspected leaders by agents of his own selection who governed the tribes and collected revenue from them; in the process, incidentally, he acquired personal possession of much property. He now feared for his life, and Chassib Khan, his eldest son, whom he had appointed as Governor of Moharnmerah in 1919, came under suspicion, as a result of which he was removed from his post in 1921 and thenceforward carefully watched. Khazal continued to enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government, who, however, had not, in his opinion, sufficiently rewarded him for his past services. (In particular, he was disappointed that Feisal ibn Hussein had been chosen as King of Iraq rather than himself.) The rise of Reza Khan. 21. The beginning of the decline of the Sheikh’s power coincided with, and was a direct result of, the rise of Reza Khan, who was ultimately personally responsible for the Sheikh’s complete downfall. General Reza Khan arrived at Tehran with his force of Cossacks in February, 1921, took control of the capital and from that time, until he became Prime Minister himself in October, 1923, was, as Minister of War, the main force in Persian politics His immediate policy was to bring the country under the control of the Central Government, and for this purpose he organised military formations in the distant parts which had hitherto been largely outside the control of the Government; at first, however, he found it politic to leave the Sheikh’s territories alone. Financial dispute between the Sheikh and the Persian Government. 22. Prior to the advent of Reza Khan, the Central Government had been showing resentment at the prosperity of Arabistan from which they were deriving no direct financial benefit owing to {a) the non-payment by the Sheikh of his annual revenue (maliyat), and (b) the appropriation to himself by the Sheikh of all indirect taxation. It is unnecessary here to enter into details of the Conf. 13055.* Conf. 11794 * Conf. 13055,* p. 222. Ditto, p. 220.8 Conf. 12004, No. 175. E 2003/2003/ 34/1922. E3121/6/34/ 1922. E4348/6/34/ 1922.

E7260/6/34/ 1922. ©arl&gt; negotiations between the Sheikh and the Central Government, but the position at the end of 1921 was briefly as follows :— The Sheikh had paid no mahyat since 1913 but, on the other hand, was claiming from the Persian Government sums which he had expended during the war in maintaining law and order in Arabistan without any assistance from the Persian Government. After prolonged negotiations, in which His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran had lent support to the Sheikh, Vossugh- ed-Dowleh had agreed to waive the payment of maliyat for the war period and to accept a moiety for six years as from 1920. Unfortunately, matters were not put on a formal basis and the Sheikh was not fully satisfied and refused to continue payment. Qawam-es-Sultaneh stated that neither his Government nor the Majlis would accept the settlement to which Vossugh-ed- Dowleh had agreed, but had offered to waive the war-time revenues in exchange for the pavment in full as from 1920. To this, however, the Sheikh would not agree unless arrangements were made by which the Persian Government would meet part of the recurring expenditure in maintaining law and order in Southern Arabistan, and when, earlv in 1922, proposals to this effect were advanced, he would accept no compromise in' spite of advice from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, who regarded the proposed terms as reasonable. 23. Matters took a new turn in April, 1922, when it was learned that the Persian Government proposed to send troops into Arabistan to compel the Sheikh to pay his revenue. The Sheikh now asked for British intervention, appealing to the assurances given to him and declaring that the despatch of a small force ^ to Arabistan would lead to unrest and anarchy, with consequent loss to British commercial interests. On learning of this, Sir P. Loraine requested the Political Resident to see the Sheikh and speak to him seriously : the Sheikh had only himself to blame, and while the British obligations to him were fully recognised they were clearly not intended to protect him from discharging his obligations to the Persian Government; the undesirability of the despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan from the British point was also fully realised, but the Minister of War (who was responsible) was an opponent of the Bolsheviks and might therefore prove an asset to His Majesty’s Government, and Sir P. Loraine did not wish to take up a bad case with him; the first essential was, therefore, that the Sheikh should come to a reasonable settlement with the Persian Government. The Political Resident, being unable himself to see the Sheikh, instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to impress upon the Sheikh that, if he desired British support in accordance with the 1914 assurances, he must fulfil his obligations to the Persian Government, among the first of whidh was the payment of revenue This produced what appeared to be a satisfactory settlement, the Sheikh promising to pay two years’ arrears of revenue on being released from payments during the war. The matter was not, however, finally settled as the actual amount of the arrears had not been fixed, but early in June Sir P. Loraine thought that the matter could be settled without his intervention and did not think that the despatch of troops to Arabistan was likely to materialise. The despatch of Persian troops to A rabistan, 1922. ^ 24. On the 18th July, 1922, Sir P. Loraine received information that the Persian Government had despatched a force of 500 men for Arabistan and at once caused representations to be made to the Minister of War and Prime Minister, calling attention to the possible resultant dangers to British interests. The Prime Minister said that on grounds of prestige he could not recall the troops (which were merely to form a bodyguard for the Governor at Shushtar) but expressed his and Reza Khan’s readiness to give formal assurances to the Sheikh that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh's territory or the Arab tribes. On the same day Sir P. Loraine sent for two leading Bakhtiari Khans, explaining the situation and the action taken; it was agreed that the interests of the Bakhtiari, the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government were identical in this matter and that the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh should support the representations of His Majesty’s Legation; the Khans proposed force, but Sir P. Loraine said that this must be absolutely the last resort and ought not to be necessary. The Foreign Office were somewhat disturbed by the report of this interview and made it clear to Sir P. Lqraine that His Majesty’s Government must not be committed to embarrassing obligations towards the Bakhtiaris; Sir P. Loraine was instructed to employ all his efforts to induce the Persian Government to abandon any inten tion as regards Southern Arabistan, but was informed that there seemed to be9 little reason to object to the “bodyguard” proposal outside the Sheikh’s territories. Matters appeared to be fairly satisfactory when the Prime Minister assured Sir P. Loraine on the 24th July that neither the Sheikh nor his interests nor those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be interfered wdth or threatened in the slightest degree by the presence of this bodyguard, but Sir P. Loraine placed little faith in these protestations and suggested that the Sheikh should endeavour to secure them in writing. Meanwhile, he was endeavouring to facilitate, so far as he could with discretion, the settlement of the Sheikh's accounts with the Persian Government. 25. The Persian detachment proceeding from Isfahan was attacked and routed by the Kuhgilu tribe at Shalil in Bakhtiari country and the remnant forced to return to Isfahan. The Persian Government suspected that the Bakhtiari and the Sheikh of Mohammerah were responsible and it was stated in Tehran that His Majesty’s Government were deliberatelv encouraging the Sheikh of Mohammerah and other southern chiefs to flout the Central Government with the premeditated design of partitioning the country. Reza Khan, however, decided to bide his time, and in a conversation with Sir P. Loraine at the end of August gave a definite assurance that no action of his would endanger the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s interests; during this conversation Sir P. Loraine made it plain that, while we had certain friendships with local chiefs, we had never used them against the Central Government or otherwise than in the interests of order and tranquillity. 26. Sir P. Loraine, in a despatch of the 4th September, 1922, examined the whole question of our relations with the Sheikh in the light of existing circum stances in Persia. The Persian Government now possessed an army with power (always assuming the continued existence of Reza Khan) to break down resistance in the outlying districts, and Sir P. Loraine’s view was that it would be preferable to deal with a strong central authority (provided we were reasonably satisfied as regards its chances of stability) rather than with a number of local rulers; this would involve a loosening of our relations with such local rulers; in his opinion. His Majesty’s Government should proceed very carefully for the time being and be as strictly non-partisan as possible; we must not abandon existing friendships but must attempt the delicate task of preparing the ground so as not to fall between two stools in the event of a radical change in the Persian situation. On the following day Sir P. Loraine sent a message to the Sheikh saying that he was satisfied Reza Khan would not take violent action and that he had promised to do nothing to endanger the common interests of Persia and Great Britain, that he (Sir P. Loraine) trusted the Sheikh to remove any grounds for suspicion against himself, and that he believed that there was a sound possibility of a good under standing between the Sheikh and the Minister of War. whom Sir P. Loraine had found trustworthy in his dealings. Lord Curzon informed Sir P. Loraine on the 12th October that he concurred entirely in the general lines of the proposed policy towards the Sheikh and that it could be pursued in reliance upon his (Lord Curzon’s) support. And the Sheikh sent a reply to Sir P. Loraine expressing his thanks for the latter’s friendly support and promising to use his best endeavours to achieve the ends for which he was advised to work. W T ith the removal of Zahir-ul-Mulk (Moayyed-ed-Dowleh), who had consistently opposed ^he Sheikh, and the appointment in his place as Governor of Arabistan of Mushar-ed-Dowleh, with whom the Sheikh established good relations, and with Reza Khan’s expressions of friendly sentiments towards the Sheikh, the eventful year 1922 closed, as far as the latter's affairs were concerned, on a peaceful note; but the financial question had not yet been definitely settled and Reza Khan was not the man to forget a rebuff or to abandon his schemes for using the army to effect the centralisation of Government control over the whole of Persia and the Sheikh had little faith in the promises of Reza Khan. Events in 1923. 27. The year 1923 was notable in the Sheikh’s affairs for the extension of the central Government’s influence in the Bakhtiari country, for the apparent settle ment of the Sheikh’s financial dispute and for the measures taken by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to bring about good relations between him and Reza Khan and to attempt to dissuade the latter from embarking upon a course of action which would adversely affect British interests in Arabistan. 28. Details of the measures by which Reza Khan broke the power and pres tige of the Bakhtiaris fall outside the scope of this memorandum, but the fact that this was done had an important bearing on the position of the Sheikh of Moham merah as it marked the crumbling of the barrier which had been for so long [32557] c E7398/6/34/ 1922.

E 5731, E 7267/ 77/34/1923 interposed between himself and the Central Government; it is true that there had been frequent troubles between him and the Bakhtiaris, but they had usually managed to combine in the face of a common danger. The Bakhtiaris were fined for complicity in the attack on the Persian troops at Shalil in the previous year, they were compelled to accept a settlement of their revenue dispute with the Persian Government and in October a body of 250 Persian troops arrived at Shushtar under Colonel Baqir Khan, who began to exercise greater power in Arabistan than the Governor himself. 29. The revenue dispute was a source of constant anxiety to His Majesty’s Legation for the best part of the year, but as a result of their good offices a settle ment was reached in the middle of November. By this settlement the Sheikh was to pay 500,000 tomans in respect of arrears, 100,000 tomans down and the remainder spread over twenty years; a sum of 150,000 tomans was to be paid annually in future by the Sheikh in respect of both direct and indirect taxation, from which a deduction of 20,000 tomans would be allowed to cover the Sheikh’s pension and other legitimate taxes. The Sheikh was thus allowel to continue to control indirect revenue, but a financial agent of the Central Government was to remain as inspecting officer for the whole province of Arabistan. 30. In April, 1923, when the Persian Government were preparing to send a military force against the Bakhtiaris, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the Shah, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and Reza Khan on the dangers of provoking the tribes in the south, with possibly harmful effects on both British and Persian interests. The Minister of War was not to be moved from his purpose, however, and Sir P. Loraine reported at the end of the month that there were further ^ indications to confirm that Arabistan was the ulterior objective, in which case Reza Khan would doubtless pursue the same tactics with the Sheikh as he had with the Bakhtiaris; the question of our assurances to the Sheikh would then arise. A few days later Sir P. Loraine telegraphed saying that an immediate decision was required whether we were to support or oppose the extension of the authority of the Central Government throughout the entire country, and, in either case, by what means; to support the Minister of War would mean the almost certain lapse of our local friendships (of which the most important and difficult case was that of the Sheikh of Mohammerah), but by giving such support we might obtain a measure of control over Reza Khan and perhaps some definite assurances as regards the Sheikh’s position; on the other hand, to oppose him meant the pros pect of the same local friendships crumbling under visible force, the gradual collapse of our position and influence unless we were prepared to use force, the thwarting of the one chance that had appeared for decades of a stable Persia under Persian control, a period of intense friction with the Persian Government almost certainly leading to a rupture, and, finally, playing into the hands of Russia. Lord Curzon, however, was not to be rushed into formulating a new policy at this juncture and replied to Sir P. Loraine calling attention to what His Majesty’s Government had done to help the Persian Government and to the apparent inability of Reza Khan to appreciate our attitude in his pursuance of an ambition to create a military dictatorship for himself; as regards the Sheikh we were bound to him by special obligations which we had no intention to ignore; Reza Khan must be made to realise that he could not prosecute his centralising^ policy to a point where it ran directly counter to British interests; in the last resort he was dependent upon His Majesty’s Government—who were alone able to afford him that financial support which he required. The Foreign Office also arranged with the Admiralty to hold some of His Majesty’s ships in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah and also up the Karun should it prove necessary to support the Sheikh. 31. On the 31st May Sir P. Loraine had a meeting with the Prime Minister and Reza Khan, who, after expressing a wish for the general improvement of Anglo-Persian relations and repeating assurances as regards British interests, said that far from having any complaints against the Sheikh, they wished and meant to support him; for internal reasons they wished to send 200 men to Shushtar; Reza Khan said that the presence of some troops in Arabistan was vital to his prestige and that if His Majesty’s Government were to veto the pro posal he would have to resign; he gave his word of honour—and promised written assurances—that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh, but that their orders would be to support him against any who might question his authority; the Prime Minister also promised to telegraph to the Sheikh saying that the Persian Government had no grievances against him and were entirely well disposed; Sir P. Loraine (who took the view that acquiescence in the despatch11 of the troops, if accompanied by adequate assurances, was less dangerous than opposition) also requested the Prime Minister to confirm on behalf of his ^overn ment the special position of the Sheikh as granted by his firmans Lord Lurzon, while agreeing that the general result of this interview was satisfactory, wished that Reza Khan’s written undertaking to the Sheikh should be countersigned by the Prime Minister, or, alternatively, that the latter should sign a similar document The giie ikh, himself, on being informed of the proposals, was far from happy, saying that he put no faith in Persian promises, oral or written and that he would withdraw his objections only if the written assurance of Reza K an were backed by a written guarantee from His Majesty’s Minister that the number of Persian troops would be limited to 200 and not increased after their arrival and that they would not interfere with his recognised rights and jurisdiction. Sir P. Loraine thereupon instructed His Majesty’s Consul at ex P la }^ to the Sheikh that he could not give such assurances, that the Sheikh should be satisfied with those given in 1914 and realise that the best guarantee of all for him was the restoration of friendly relations between Persia and Hreat Britain and that the British Foreign Secretary considered that the assurances offered by Reza Khan were satisfactory if endorsed by the Persian 1 rime Minister To this message the Sheikh replied that, if Sir P. Loraine were satisfied as to the bona fides of the Minister of War and felt that wider political considerations so demanded, he was prepared to give way; but if later on events turned out as he (the Sheikh) anticipated, he would look confidently to His Majesty’s Government to redeem the pledge given to him in 1914 and to support him against Persian Government encroachments. 33. Some delay, partly due to the change in government, occurred before the Persian Government sent any assurances to the Sheikh, and in the mean while detachments of troops had' been sent to Shushtar and Bebehan. On the 7th October Reza Khan addressed a letter to Sir P. Loraine stating that these troops had been sent with the principal object of maintaining peace and security and that the local tribes would be supported so long as they fulfilled their duties and obligations to the central Government. The letter went on to say :— “Especially in connexion with the loyal services of his Excellency Serdar Akdass (Sheikh of Mohammerah) and the appreciation of the Ministry of War which his Excellency will, no doubt, win for himself in the course of his services, with the result that his Excellency may have complett faith and confidence in the friendly attitude and justice of the Government. In order to leave his Excellency no grounds for anxiety, the first instructions given to the officer commanding the departing troops were to be on his guard to prevent people who have local quarrels with his Excellency from abusing the arrival of the troops and turning it to their own evil advantage.’’ E 6019/1416/ 34/1923. E6156/1416/ 34/1923. E11560/1416/ 34/1923. On the same day, the Persian Prime Minister addressed a telegram to the Sheikh in the following terms “Although your Excellency’s services have always attracted attention of Government which has full confidence in you, nevertheless now in order that you may be aware of intentions of Government I hereby declare that Council of Ministers appreciate always your Excellency’s services. As long as your Excellency endeavours to render services to Government latter will have full confidence in you and will never forget your Excellency’s services.’’ The only comment in the Foreign Office on learning of these two messages was that they were both capable of various interpretations but that they were better than nothing! . , , 34. Sir P. Loraine now sought to effect a genuine rapprochement between Reza Khan and the Sheikh and to endeavour to allay the latter’s fears. He decided to visit the Sheikh and before his departure spoke to Reza Khan, who said that His Majesty’s Minister could give the Sheikh the most positive assurances of his friendship and regard and of his anxiety to establish a personal understanding with him. , ^ , , , , 35. Sir P. Loraine visited Ahwaz on the 13th October and had a conversa tion with the Sheikh, who expressed his anxieties as to his future position and begged that he should not be lulled into a false sense of security only to be struck down when all the obstacles to the Persian unifying policy had been removed; he could not remain in Arabistan with his prestige diminished and his authority undermined, and would sooner lease or sell his properties and retire to some part of the world where he could be under British protection. Sir P. Loraine, in reply, analysed current British policy in Persia, according to which it was [32557] c 2 E10269/1416/ 34/1923. E11731/1416/ 34/1923. E11731/1416/ 34/1923.12 E11666/1416/ 34/1923.

Persian Gulf Administration Report for 1924, p. 50 (Persia 35). essential that the friends of the British Government in Persia should be the friends of the Persian Government also, and said that he was convinced that the Minister of War harboured no sinister intentions towards the Sheikh, adding that the sincerity of Reza Khan’s promises could only be proved by time, and that the Sheikh must give him an opportunity of translating his words into action. The Sheikh said that he could put no faith in Persian promises, where upon Sir P. Loraine asked him bluntly whether he expected the British Govern ment to go to war with Persia in order to maintain the Sheikh in his position of semi-independence. The Sheikh protested that he did not wish to be a source of embarrassment to the British Government, but felt compelled to voice his fears; he would loyally carry out any instructions which His Majesty’s Minister might give him, and if he found his authority being undermined he would inform Sir P. Loraine and rely upon him to find a solution. Sir P. Loraine replied that he would at all times do his best to protect the Sheikh and that the continuance of the latter’s existing friendly relations with the Persian Government and especially with Reza Khan provided the best guarantee of his ability to ensure that protection. 36. At a later interview on the 16th October, the Sheikh showed his readiness to throw in his lot with Reza Khan, having had a satisfactory interview the previous day with Colonel Baqir Khan, the Persian commander at Shushtar. The Sheikh was anxious to have a personal interview with Reza Khan and suggested that he should offer the latter two armoured cars. On his return to Tehran Sir P. Loraine gave Reza Khan on the 22nd October a brief account of what had passed. Reza Khan expressed his readiness to meet the Sheikh and ^ promised to arrange this as soon as possible; he accepted the gift of armoured cars not for himself personally but on behalf of the army and the nation; and he promised to look after the Sheikh’s second son on his arrival at Tehran as a Deputy in the Majlis. The satisfactory settlement of the revenue dispute followed in mid-November and early in December Sir P. Loraine reported that, acting on his advice, the Sheikh had adjusted the agreement to suit the wishes of Reza Khan in regard to the non-deduction by the Sheikh of amounts spent on maintaining armed forces under his own control. The year thus closed with matters about as satisfactory as they could be, given the circumstances, but the Foreign Office had grave doubts whether the existing good relations between the Sheikh and Reza Khan (who had assumed the Premiership at the end of October) could long continue. The Rebellion of the Sheikh, 1924. 37. No major dispute arose between the Sheikh and the Central Govern ment during the first half of 1924, during which Reza Khan seems to have resorted to a policy of infiltration into the Sheikh’s territories. Thus, the Persian Govern ment announced their intention of sending a Karguzar to Abadan, who was also to act as Deputy Governor; the Adliyeh at Shushtar began to summon Arabs living in the Sheikh’s territories to attend the Court; a salt monopoly was given to an Iraqi subject without the Sheikh’s being consulted; contrary to the arrange ments regarding indirect taxes, a Rais-al-Baladiyeh was appointed for Abadan; steps were taken to assess the value of the Sheikh’s date gardens with a view to further taxation; heads of Persian departments in Ahwaz, at the instigation, A it was believed, of the Russian Consul, met constantly and abused the Sheikh and the Persian commander, Arabistan (now re-named Khuzistan), did his best to foment trouble among the Arab tribes. But at the beginning of the year Reza Khan had other and more important matters in hand. Shortly after the Minister of War had assumed the premiership, the Shah, feeling himself powerless to resist the encroaching influence of his Prime Minister and fearing for his own personal safety, decided to visit Europe and keep out of the way. His absence added strength to the Republican movement, with which Reza Khan’s name became associated, but the movement collapsed at the end of March and Reza Khan’s prestige and influence reached their lowest level; he resigned early in April but quidkly resumed the premiership on being invited by the Majlis to return. It is also worth recording, because it was a matter of concern to Sheikh Khazal. that there had been considerable changes in British official personnel with whom he had had dealings in the past: Sir P. Loraine was absent on leave from Tehran and Mr. Ovey was in charge of the Legation between the 28th March and the 15th November; Sir P. Cox, who had had so many dealings with the Sheikh and who, as High Commissioner at Bagdad, had not been so far removed geographically, had retired in 1923; and Colonel Trevor, the Political Resident who had served continuously in the Persian Gulf since 1912, left Bushire in April 1924. At a farewell interview with the Sheikh early in March, Colonel Trevor13 found him in a depressed state of mind. The Sheikh spoke of his past services to His Majesty’s Government and of how he had followed their advice in meeting the wishes of the Persian Government; he was, however, convinced of the latter’s hostile intentions towards himself, and attributed this primarily to his friendship with the British Government. He wished to know whether the latter would preserve him in his autonomous position, and also, if the Persian Government made a direct attack on him, whether he should resist or submit. Colonel Trevor expressed his inability to answer the first question on his own authority, and as regards the latter, said that he could hardly advise the Sheikh to resist his own Government. In reporting this conversation Colonel Trevor expressed his own firm conviction that Reza Khan was desirous of reducing the power of the Sheikh and raised the question of the 1914 assurances, pointing out that if we were to stand by and watch the Persian Government take progressive steps to reduce the Sheikh’s state of local autonomy, such an attitude would have a deplorable effect locally, and the Sheikh, not without some reason on his side, would think himself badly let down. Mr. Ovey’s comment on this report was to the effect that the Persian Government had done nothing which was not in accordance with the assurances given in the present year and that there did not appear to be any special grounds for the Sheikh’s nervousness; and the view expressed in the Foreign Office was that it was easy to understand the latter’s attitude, but that there was no reason to suppose that His Majesty’s Government would not continue to afford him adequate support by diplomatic means provided he paid his revenues and gave the Persian Government no valid excuse for interference in his territorv. * 38. A crisis arose early in August, partly due to the hostile attitude of Colonel Baqir Khan (the Persian Commander at Shushtar), but principally to the action of the Persian Government (inspired by their American financial advisers) in informing the Sheikh that his firmans were invalid, having been cancelled by a later firman of 1903. The Sheikh now expressed his determination to resist any further interference, if necessary by force, and commenced taking steps to secure the allegiance of his tribes. Mr. Ovey instructed His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to inform the Sheikh (a) that he realised the latter’s anxiety, but that he could not believe that the Persian Government could legally proceed to the lengths feared; {b) that he would call the Prime Minister’s attention to the grave issues involved and hoped to prevent any precipitate action; and (c) that if, instead of awaiting the results of the support of His Majesty’s Government, the Sheikh were to commit any rebellious act, he would be puttin 0, himself in the wrong and would prejudice his case with His Majesty’s Govern ment, who remained always willing fully to su^yort his just claims.' Mr. Ovev added that if the Sheikh thought that the Prime Minister’s position had been shaken by recent political developments he was much mistaken and instructed the Acting Consul to use every argument to keep the Sheikh quiet. On the 23rd August the Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Ovey informing him of reports received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that the Sheikh was forming an alliance with the Bakhtiari, Kashgai, &amp;c., and was speaking of inviting the Shah to return to Mohammerah. Mr. Ovey was instructed {a) to have a further message sent to the Sheikh to the effect that, while he might rest assured that under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, Mr. Ovey was doing his utmost to induce the Persian Government to accord just consideration to the Sheikh’s recognised rights and interests, he must be reminded that the British assurances were dependent upon his loyalty to the central Government and that he should refrain from any violent action which would be highly prejudicial both to his own and British interests; and (b) to inform the Persian Prime Minister that his recent administrative measures in South-West Persia appeared to be inconsistent with repeated assurances given to His Majesty’s Government and threatened vital British interests in those regions where they could not view any untoward developments with indifference; Reza Khan should therefore be urged to abstain from pressing matters to an issue. Mr. Ovey took active steps and m the result the Prime Minister sent a message to the Sheikh sayino- that toThp^ ™ intention of dispossessing him but that his attention was drawn to the fact that he must not sell land to foreigners, and assuring him of support m every way as long as he continued to be loyal. The Sheikh was not yet satisfied especially as Reza Khan subsequently sent him a bombastic and tactless telegram’ and m conversation with His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (Colonel Peel) expressed his determination to overthrow Reza Khan or perish in the attempt Tn ht th&lt; i S f trug ? e . wa ? in evitable and there was more chance of success at that time than later; ^e insisted that he was not taking the initiative but defending his detost^'measure^onlv^^the ^p a ^° n M^^ dedared that he W0llld abandoa ueiensive measures only if the Prime Minister agreed (i) to give written E 4642/263/ 34/1924.

In addition, the Sheikh required a guarantee from His Majesty’s Government against unfriendly acts by Reza Khan in the future, and asked whether they would sell him arms and ammunition secretly. Colonel Peel added that he anticipated no danger to the pipe-line and that the Sheikh was unlikely to make any move against Persian troops unless he were attacked or reinforcements were sent towards Bebehan. 39. On September 13th Mr. Ovey was requested to instruct the Political Resident to proceed to Mohammerah and hold language to the Sheikh in accordance with the Foreign Office instructions of the 23rd August, and he was also told to convey a message to the Prime Minister (then in Luristan) warning him of the great danger to which he might be exposing South-West Persia. These instructions were followed by others on the 17th September authorising Mr. Ovey to negotiate with Reza Khan with a view to the acceptance of the Sheikh’s conditions (i) and (iv) and as regards (ii) of a compromise that troops should not be reinforced as long as the Sheikh undertook to behave properly. In addi tion, a further message was to be sent to the Sheikh explaining what was being attempted on his behalf, but stating that His Majesty’s Government could not condone his warlike attitude or assist him in any way to defy the Persian Govern ment, and that, unless he abandoned his warlike attitude, they could not hold themselves responsible for the consequences. In the meantime, the Political m Resident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Abdul Hamid), the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Riza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Reza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Reza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16th the Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against the Prime Minister, who was described as “a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian nation.” The Foreign Office therefore felt it necessary to inform Mr. Ovey that His Majesty's Government had no wish to avoid the guarantees to the Sheikh so long as he shoidd maintain an attitude on which they were conditional, but that he would not be justified in looking to them for support were he to kindle a war and suffer defeat. The Foreign Office felt that it was essential that the atti tude of His Majesty's Government should be clearly understood by the Sheikh, who might be led into the belief by other British contacts (e.g., local repre sentatives of the oil company) that he would have the sympathy of the British Government in his struggle. 40. Roza Khan, from whatever motive, reacted favourably to Mr. Ovey's representations and practically placed himself in the hands of His Majesty’^ Government; he undertook to refrain from asking the Majlis to proclaim the Sheikh a rebel and to approve warlike operations; he further undertook to confirm the Sheikh’s firmans, to recapitulate all his previous assurances to the Sheikh, and to guarantee the lives and properties of the Sheikh and his family and also Amir Mujahid. In return, Reza Khan said he must insist on Amir Mujahid’s exile and the Sheikh’s absence from Persia for three months, during which time he would definitely undertake to refrain from any military action or threats; he would also guarantee the Sheikh’s return, provided the latter made a suitable declaration of submission. All these undertakings were neces sarily contingent upon His Majesty’s Government succeeding in restoring the status quo ante in Khuzistan. 41. The Foreign Office considered that Reza Khan was acting with moderation and their only criticism of his attitude was that the proposed insistence on the Sheikh’s temporary departure from Persia might bring about a state of civil war. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald ^directed that our policy should be to hold ourselves impartial and enjoin peace, adding that we should, of course, lean to the regular authority and impress both sides accordingly. He informed Mr. Ovey on the 22nd September that he, like Lord Curzon, had never opposed Reza Khan’s policy of consolidating power in the hands of the Central Govern ment, as the one wish of His Majesty’s Government was to see a strong and unified Persia: he hoped, however, that Mr. Ovey would be able to persuade Reza Khan to abstain from insisting upon what amounted to the temporary banishment of the Sheikh and instructed him to persuade the latter to abstain from mobilising his forces. The Sheikh, who expressed his confidence in the15 result of a struggle with Reza Khan, proved difficult, and in an interview with Colonel Peel on tne ‘30th September, said that if his conditions were not accepted he would regard the British Government as having betrayed him. Further ehorts were made by Mr. Ovey to persuade the Sheikh to adopt a reasonable attitude and these were reinforced in a personal message which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald sent to the Sheikh in the middle of October. This message made it clear that His Majesty’s Government abided fully by the undertakings given to the Sheikh in the past, but that such undertakings were conditional upon the Sheikh s observing his loyal obligations towards the Persian Government and that, in the regrettable event of hostilities, the Sheikh could expect no sympathy from His Majesty’s Government; Mr. Ramsay MacDonald expressed his confidence that an honourable settlement could be reached through the mediation of His Majesty’s Government, and urged the Sheikh to desist from all military prepara tions and make his peace with the Central Government. 42. The Sheikh’s replv was to the following effect: he desired that His Majesty’s Government should procure for him an honourable settlement, but he could not accept the terms offered by His Majesty’s Legation because he would lose his position in his territories and could no longer maintain peace there, so that his friendship towards the British Government would be worthless to them; the British were holding him back but meanwhile Reza Khan w r as proceeding with his military preparations; he felt that he had already lost the support of the British Government and suggested that he should either retire from Khuzistan with his whole family (being granted a residence and means ^ of subsistence) or else that he be freed from restraint and allowed to fight Reza Khan, which he felt confident of doing with success; in the latter case, he was equally confident of his ability to protect British lives and property. The best hope of a peaceful settlement now appeared to lie in arranging a meeting between Reza Khan and the Sheikh, and, acting on instructions, Mr. Ovey approached both with the suggestion that they should meet at some place other than Tehran and that Sir P. Loraine should Be present at the interview'. After persuasion Reza Khan agreed but stipulated that the Sheikh must first send some message of submission and Mr. Ovey then sent a message urging the Sheikh to comply and giving a personal assurance that such a message would be followed by an immediate cessation of military preparations on the part of the Central Govern ment. Matters were also helped on by the abandonment bv Reza Khan of his demand that the Sheikh should temporarily leave Persia, but the Sheikh still made difficulties and it became clear that little could be done except play for time until Sir P. Loraine arrived in Persia and exercised his personal influence on both parties; and playing for time became increasingly difficult, particularly as, contrary to promises given to Mr. Ovey, Reza Khan continued to move his troops westwards of the line, Bebehan-Zaidun-Bander Dilam. 43. Early in November the Sheikh, influenced no doubt partly by His Majesty’s Government’s clear disapproval of his rebellion and partly by doubts as to the measure of support to be expected from the Bakhtiari and his other supporters, had decided to make his submission to Reza Khan; he expressed his readiness to meet the latter at Bushire provided that the meeting took place under the auspices of Sir P. Loraine and that the latter w^ould give him assurances ^as to his safety. But Reza Khan was now becoming impatient at the delay, probably because the approach of winter would hamper military operations. Mr. Austen Chamberlain (who had succeeded Mr. Ramsay MacDonald at the Foreign Office) addressed a telegram to Sir P. Loraine on the 11th November explaining the view of His Majesty’s Government that the Sheikh, although to some extent provoked, had put himself in the wrong by planning rebellion and by insisting on the conditions (ii) and (iii) (see para. 38 above); it was hoped that Sir P. Loraine would be able to show both sides the folly of pushing matters to an extreme; it might be necessary to speak strongly to the Sheikn because Reza Khan could not be expected to ignore the implications of the Sheikh’s telegrams to the Majlis and the foreign legations and to meet the Sheikh without some preliminary expression of the latter’s regret; the Sheikh oould. however, be informed that, mindful of his loyal services during the war, His Majesty’s Government were still doing their best to help him out of a difficult predicament. Sir P. Loraine was informed that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to see the Sheikh expelled or unduly humiliated, nor did they wish to prejudice their improved relations with the Persian Government; it was not desired to fetter Sir P. Loraine with detailed instructions, but if he could persuade the Sheikh to make the first move towards reconciliation, it did not seem unlikely that Reza Khan would be found ready to listen to reason.

Loraine met the Sheikh at Ahwaz on the 13th December and persuaded him to address to Reza Khan a telegram of regret and submission, but now Reza Khan made difficulties and was guilty of a number of breaches of faith. The rebellion had collapsed and he wished to drive home his advantage, while at Tehran criticism was being voiced in the Majlis regarding foreign intervention in Persian internal affairs. Reza Khan now demanded the Sheikh’s unconditional surrender instead of, as arranged, sending him a friendly message; Persian troops continued to move beyond the agreed line and Reza Khan expressed his intention of marching to Mohammerah; and he now made difficulties about meeting Sir P. Loraine and the Sheikh at Bushire, stating that this was no longer possible owing to the news of the proposal having leaked out. In addition, there was reason to believe that Moscow had put in a spoke to prevent a satisfactory arrange ment being reached. In view of Reza Khan’s attitude and the failure of our policy of “ biased neutrality,” His Majesty’s Government and Sir P. Loraine now adopted a strong line with the Persian Government and Reza Khan, in the course of which the substance of the 1914 assurances to the Sheikh were disclosed to the Persian Government; the attitude of His Majesty’s Government now was that, by his submission, the Sheikh had put himself in the right, that they attached importance to abiding by their obligations to him (although, in view of the situation in Egypt following the murder of Sir Lee Stack on the 19th November, they were anxious not to be embroiled in South Persia), that they were still desirous of doing everything in their power to secure a settlement satisfactory to the Persian Government, but that if the latter persisted in attacking the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government reserved to themselves the right to take such measures as they might think fit in pursuance of their assurances to the Sheikh. But the latter was now a sick man and had suffered a moral collapse, and Reza Khan, by taking full advantage of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to avoid complica tions, was master of the situation. Sir P. Loraine expressed doubts whether it would be possible to obtain terms for the Sheikh favourable enough to make it worth his while to remain in Khuzistan, but he eventually arranged for Reza Khan and the Sheikh to meet at Ahwaz on the 6th December. After a preliminary meeting, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the former, explaining the position of His Majesty’s Government and emphasising the scrupulous loyalty of their attitude and their strong desire that the Sheikh’s position should be substantially maintained. Reza Khan’s reply was reassuring : he wanted to maintain the Sheikh in effective authority, but must arrange this in such a manner as to disarm his ciitics in Tehran; he did not want a breach with His Majesty’s Government and promised to hold up the advance of Persian troops. The result of the Ahwaz conference seemed to bear out Reza Khan’s promises. He and the Sheikh swore friendship on the Koran; Persian troops were to remain at Shustar till the spring when, except for detachments, they would be withdrawn provided the pacification of Luristan had been completed; as a temporary measure Reza Khan would appoint a governor at Ahwaz, but this governorship would be restored to the Sheikh in the spring and meanwhile the temporary governor would have no power to interfere with the Sheikh’s authority over the Arab tribes; minor points regarding jurisdiction, police, taxation, &lt;fec., were reserved for subsequent discussion and all Persian officials', including the military, would have strict orders to work in harmony with the Sheikh and give him any help he mighty require. Reza Khan assured Sir P. Loraine that he would not allow agitation in Tehran to deflect him from his purpose and that Sir P. Loraine could be free from anxiety. Sir P. Loraine also reported that Reza Khan realised that the Soviets had been adopting a perfidious attitude throughout in an endeavour to prevent a peaceful settlement and to drive Reza Khan into armed action. * The New Attitude of His Majesty's Government, 1925. 45. The immediate crisis was over but matters were by no means finally settled. It was clear, however, that the old regime had come to an end and that Reza Khan, having established a strangle-hold over Khuzistan would be unlikely ever voluntarily to relinquish it. His Majesty's Government were now in an embarrassing position : the services which the Sheikh had rendered them in the past and general considerations of prestige in Persian Gulf made it undesirable that they should abruptly terminate their assurances to the Sheikh ; the safety of the oilfields and of British lives had to be considered; but the assurances were not compatible with the general policy of strengthening the Central Government and the embarrassing position in which His Majesty’s Government found them selves presented the Soviet Government with wonderful opportunities for fishing in troubled waters. During his discussions with Reza Khan at Ahwaz,Sir P. Loraine had told him that the most serious danger of friction in South Persia between Great Britain and Persia would arise from friction between the latter and the Sheikh and that he believed that a close understanding between Reza Khan and the Sheikh would directly strengthen the position of Reza Khan and his Government in Tehran—which would be in accordance with the desires of His Majesty’s Government; he went further and stated that he wished all Great Britain’s friends in South Persia to be friends of Tehran and to help their own Government and for the latter to feel that the south was safe, loyal and peaceful, so that, should danger arise from other quarters, the south could be relied on. In replying to Sir P. Loraine’s report on his proceedings, Sir Austen Chamberlain said :— “ I share your view that the policy of His Majesty's Government in Persia should be to discourage separatist movements likely to weaken the central authority of the Persian Government and am of the opinion that the policy outlined in your despatch of rallying the tribal chieftains of South Persia to the support of the Persian Government is best calculated to improve the relations of His Majesty's Government with that Government. The chieftains themselves will thus be led to realise that their traditional friendship with His Majesty’s Government is fully compatible with their duty as loyal Persian subjects.” Sir P. Loraine was aiming at a final and honourable discharge of His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to the Sheikh so that our future action on his behalf could be limited to securing, so far as possible without prejudice to our relations with the Persian Government, the observance of Reza Khan’s promises as regards the Sheikh’s future position, while continuing to urge the Sheikh to deal with Reza Khan direct in matters affecting his own position and authority. Given a correct attitude on the part of the Sheikh therefore, everything turned upon the good faith of Reza Khan. The Final Downfall of the Sheikh, 1925. 46. After the Ahwaz meeting, the Sheikh appears to have resigned himself to the new regime and his main concern was now to retain his properties; but he was in an uncomfortable position, because, with his loss of prestige, he had become the target for claims by many whom he had dispossessed while at the height of his power. He informed Reza Khan that he wished to divide his properties among his sons and travel abroad, but Reza Khan asked him not to leave Persia and urged him to proceed to Tehran, where his presence would greatly assist in the regularisation of the position as regards his properties. (Reza Khan may, or may not, at this time have been genuinely desirous of arriving at a satis factory settlement of the Sheikh’s affairs, but it is worthy of note that he subse quently mentioned to Sir P. Loraine the possibility that the Sheikh would retire to Iraq, where his presence would be an embarrassment to the Persian Government; no doubt this consideration played its part in Reza Khan's anxiety to persuade the Sheikh to visit Tehran.) The Sheikh, in spite of reassuring messages from Reza Khan and of Sir P. Loraine’s advice to comply with Reza Khan’s request, was undoubtedly afraid to proceed to the capital. He spoke to the acting British Consul at Ahwaz on the 18th April about his grievances, main taining that Reza Khan had broken his promises to him and that he could no longer place any faith in his word; the Sheikh had been advised to rest, but if he went to Tehran he would be worried into his grave and doubted whether he would ever be allowed to leave the capital; such a journey would be a further humiliation and he could not go there as a suppliant seeking to regain property which was his legally. He eventually told Mr. Monypenny that, while he would not go himself, he would send a representative to Tehran; but this decision was too late, for on the same day he and his son, Abdul Hamid, were arrested by Reza Khan’s orders and taken to Tehran under escort. 47. Reza Khan sought to justify this new breach of faith as necessitated by the Sheikh’s refusal to proceed to Tehran voluntarily and by the possibility of his taking up residence in Iraq. To put himself right with Sir P. Loraine, he readily agreed to the latter’s suggestion that the Sheikh should receive a welcome on approaching Tehran and should ” arrive honourably and in no way under arrest,” and said that a house was being placed at his disposal at which his real personal friends (though not political agitators) could visit him. Sir P. Loraine’s view was that there were only two alternative methods of dealing with the [32557] D E 649/136/34/ 1925. E2100/136/ 34/1925. E1572/136/ 34/1925. E 2502/136/ 34/1925.

He had, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, tried the first course and all now depended upon whether Reza Khan would arrange the Sheikh’s affairs in a satisfactory manner. At first, everything promised well as the Sheikh told Sir P. Loraine that he had been treated with the greatest consideration and respect, that Reza Khan had given him a warm and affectionate welcome and had said that political considerations had obliged him to bring the Sheikh to Tehran as an act of authority but that there would shortly be a relaxation. In addition, Reza Khan renewed his promise to Sir P. Loraine to put the Sheikh’s affairs straight, undertaking, if the Sheikh behaved wisely, to rehabilitate his prestige in a public manner; and by the beginning of October Sir P. Loraine was able to report good prospects of a satisfactory settlement on the basis of the payment by the Sheikh of a sum of half a million tomans as his share of the expenses of the Khuzistan campaign of 1924. in return for which his firmans would be ratified and he would be allowed to return with tribal authority and high position (but without the right to have armed forces). 48. Although in certain quarters closely interested in the fate of the Sheikh there was a feeling that he had been “ let down ” by His Majesty’s Government, his arrest and removal to Tehran did not lead to a loss of British prestige to the extent that might have been expected given the key position which he had formerly held and the manner in which that position had been built up with the support of the British Government. As a measure of the interest taken in the event in this country it may be noted that it inspired only one question in Parliament, and that was answered without difficulty and without giving rise to supplementaries. As far as Khuzistan was concerned, apart from a purely local disturbance at the time of the arrest, the event was received with apparent indifference. The Sheikh’s son Abdullah acted as chief of the Muhaisin during his father’s absence (and, incidentally, did so more in his own than in his father’s interests). It is true that at the end of July, 1925 there was a short-lived tribal rising at Mohammerah (for which the Sheikh was in no way responsible), but this was due not so much to sympathy with the Sheikh in detention at Tehran as to other causes—economic factors, the removal of experienced head-men and the rule of Persian officials over Arabs, feared new taxation and threatened loss of properties, 'plus, it was suspected, Soviet intrigues. Subsequent negotiations and the death of the Sheikh. 49. Little object would here be served by a detailed account of the negotia tions between the Persian Government and the Sheikh during the latter’s last years at Tehran. It will suffice to record that the negotiations were marked not only by more than usual Oriental procrastination but also by gross breaches of faith on the part of the Central Government, who had obviously no intention of carrying out the promises given to the Sheikh and to Sir P. Loraine at the end of 1924 and subsequently and who were obviously merely waiting for the Sheikh to die. His Majesty’s Government continued unofficially to urge the Persian Government to come to a satisfactory settlement and release the Sheikh, but their efforts were unavailing and in the end even the Sheikh himself came to realise that representations by His Majesty’s Legation on his behalf were more likely to do harm than good. After eleven years of detention, Sheikh Khazal died during the night of the 24th-25th May, 1936, having been deprived by the Persian Government of his estates in Khuzistan and without any settlement having been reached regarding the compensation which had been promised to him. In record ing the death of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran said : “ His epitaph might be what is perhaps the only genuine remark which the local authorities (in the person of Teymourtache in 1930) made about him, that the ‘ interests of the individual must be sacrificed to the public good.’ ” British relations wi^h the Sheikh in matters outside Persian jurisdiction. 50. His Majesty’s Government, with the recollection of the Sheikh’s services in the past and with their inability to carry out the assurances which they had given him, had the Sheikh very much on their conscience. Consequently, they did their utmost to meet any claims which the Sheikh might have against them in so far as matters lay outside Persian jurisdiction. Thus, in 1935, they and the Government of India jointly made an ex gratia payment to him of 50,000 rupees in repayment of a loan which he had advanced to the Government of India in1924—25. This loan was in respect of the erection of consular premises at Ahwaz, the building of which had been commenced but had, after the fall of the Sheikh, been abandoned owing to certain town-planning schemes. I he Sheikh s f° the land in question was more than doubtful and he had none to the buildings except for the foundations; and it was not considered that he had any legal claim against either the Government of India or His Majesty s Government in the matter. But the Foreign Office successfully urged that the loan should be legalded as a debt of honour and that it should be repaid on the grounds of His Majesty s Government s moral responsibility for doing anything possible for our former protege, who, in addition to his political fall, was now in grave financial straits. 51. The repayment of the loan in respect of the Ahwaz consular site was of relatively minor importance although illustrative of His Majesty s Govern ment’s attitude. Of much greater importance, however, was the question of the Sheikh’s date gardens in Iraq, regarding which assurances had been given in 1914 (see last paragraph of Document No. 6 in the Annex). A detailed account of developments in this highly complicated question would be out of place in the present memorandum, but very briefly the position was as follows. The assurance to the Sheikh was fully implemented during the period when His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were responsible to the League of Nations for the administration of Iraq, but successive Iraqi Governments refused to accept the financial commitment in this assurance (and in a similar one given to the Sheikh of Koweit) as binding upon Iraq after the establishment of the indepen dence of that country in 1932. In tihat year the Iraqi Government altered their system of taxation upon agricultural products by a measure known as the Istihlak tax, as a result of which taxation was no longer levied on the land itself but on such parts of the crop as were sold or exported. It was decided that, in the event of continued failure to persuade the Iraqi Government to accept the financial commitment to the two Sheikhs, an obligation to compensate the latter must rest upon His Majesty’s Government. The cases of the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit differed 'in that the latter was nominally independent whereas the former was not, and in any case the question arose whether bheikh Khazal could have a “ successor ” in the sense of the 1914 assurances. It was decided, however, that in this matter the Sheikh should be treated during his life-time on the same basis as the Sheikh of Koweit and the whole question of compensation was under active consideration when Khazal died. The decision was then reached that pay ment of compensation for losses in respect of Istihlak taxation should be made to the Sheikh’s heirs on an ex-qratia basis, and in 1940/41 the sum of £15,218 was distributed among them in full and final settlement of past losses on account of this taxation since 1932 and of prospective further losses from this or alternative forms of taxation on the land or its produce; in return, the heirs (or their trustees in the case of minors) were required to sim documents accepting payment as a full settlement of any claims against His Majesty’s Government under the pledge given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1914 in this particular regard. The fate of the British assurances. 52. While, as has been seen, the policy of His Majesty s Government after the Sheikh’s rebellion in 1924 had been to endeavour honourably to disembarrass themselves of the assurances given to him in times when circumstances were very different, and while they could, on a strict reading of those assurances, have declared that the Sheikh’s disregard of their advice both in 1924 and in 1925 had rendered the assurances null and void, the fact is that they never did so. All was changed by the arrest of the Sheikh and subsequent acts of bad faith on the part of the Shah, and no purpose would have been served and the feelings of an old and sick man, who still regarded His Majesty’s Government with friendli ness and loyalty, would have been deeply wounded by any such action. The assurances therefore (for what they were now worth) were merely allowed to lapse on his death. In June, 1944, however, Sheikh Chassib, Khazal’s renegade eldest son, wrote to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran calling attention to the assurances and enlisting the suppo?t of His Majesty’s Government in the demand of Sheikh Khazal’s family for the restitution of their rightful properties. His Majesty’s Government’s attitude towards any suggestion that their assurances extended after the death of Khazal to his family was explained to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in a despatch of the 29th August, 1944. After describing why the assurances were not regarded in principle as having lapsed during the Sheikh’s lifetime, this despatch made the following points :— (a) His Majesty’s Government need have no feelings of delicacy towards Sheikh Khazal’s heirs, as they had had towards the Sheikh himself, [32557] d 2 E2649/1S/93/ 1936 E1365/110/ 93/1940. E 456, E 1836/ 456/93/1941. E4039/155/ 34/1944.20 in divesting themselves of all future responsibility under the assurances in so far as they related to Persia; (b) it was true that the assurances spoke of the Sheikh’s successors, but there was no successor to the Sheikh in the position which he held when the assurances were given; (c) the assurances referred to the nomination of successors by the Sheikh, and consultation with and approval by His Majesty’s Government was provided for : but so far as was known, the Sheikh did not nominate a successor and there was certainly no consultation with His Majesty’s Government in the matter; (d) if Sheikh Chassib, as the eldest son, regarded himself as the successor, he could hardly say that he had been guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government and had maintained an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Mr. Lascelles was therefore told that, in any dealings with Sheikh Chassib, His Majesty’s Legation should act on the assumption that His Majesty’s Govern ment were no longer bound by any assurances in respect of Sheikh Khazal himself or his family; this would not preclude His Majesty’s Legation from using their good offices on behalf of the family when this might appear desirable or expedient, but it should be understood by all concerned that any action taken in this sense would be as a matter of grace and not of obligation. Foreign Office, October 1946. HUGH K. GREY. ANNEX. Texts of British Assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, 1902-14. No. 1. Sir A . Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) 7th December, 1902. I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Tehran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring, but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may be possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. I was very glad to hear from Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible ^ be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence of the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that, under the present circum stances, the Arabs, and yourself as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think you acted wisely in giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a custom-house, and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to do, to a friendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration. Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as you behaved to us, as you have done in the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere with them. Hajji Reis thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself, nor of attack by21 neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders; but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might, as an enemy of the Shah, send ships to attack your district; or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act on its behalf, might attempt, also by means of its ships, to conquer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise we should, I believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice; and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gulf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. J stated, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regard the danger—at any rate at present—as a real one. The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as you do, the preservation of peace in Arabistan, and the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them. We reserve, of course, our right to object to any further change which we may consider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detrimental to our interests. I trust that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will be very likely some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. No. 2. Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, gAth December, 1903. I have received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency’s statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are, in his opinion, justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. I do not propose to do so until I hear further from you, as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile, I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further information on the subject. T ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.22 No. 3. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) ls£ December, 1908. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform you that I duly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview which I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with your Excellency on the 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of Government expenditure subsequently received from you through Mr. McDouall. The reply of His Majesty’s Government reached me through His Majesty’s Legation in September last, but, in view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity of the post, X thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to headquarters. On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan, and have since waited for your return to Failieh, I am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview above referred to, and I am then to add that His Majesty's Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty's Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that under- taking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Pars, &amp;c. No. 4. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After the usual compliments.) Mohammerah, \§th May, 1909. On the 1st December, 1908, I had the honour, by the direction of His Majesty’s Government, to repeat to your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of Government by his Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British ^ Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 7th December, 1902, to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance of the same state of autonomy which your Excel lency at present enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you repre sented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State, and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the inter vention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention ofsimilar action on the part of parliamentary government, in reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your Excellency would become even more binding than before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now pre pared to extend the application of those assurances to your ' heirs and successors. } ' Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements; but you have further requested that the words “ heirs and successors ' may be changed and the words “ own successive male descendants may be written instead; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, bv adding after the words “male descendants’’ as above, the words “ up to a period of 100 years ” (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no lime in communicating to them your representations. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.
