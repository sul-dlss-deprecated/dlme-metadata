The main correspondents are the following: ministers and senior officials at the Foreign Office, the India Office and the Admiralty in London; the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council and his senior officials at both the Foreign Department and the Marine Department of the Government of India in Calcutta and Simla [Shimla]; the Commander-in-Chief, HM Ships and Vessels, East Indies Squadron (also referred to as the Naval Commander-in-Chief) and the Commander and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. They also discuss arms control and relations with the chiefs of the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, the drafting of a Trucial Coast Order in Council conferring on the Bahrain Political Agent jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in Bahrain, and the cost of establishing a Vice-Consulate at Lingah. Included in the correspondence is a report of a naval coastal survey of the Khor (inlet) at Zora near Ajman together with a navigational plan of the entrance to the Al Ajman and Zora Khors, made in 1911.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Commerce Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Marine Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Zora</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00000b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
