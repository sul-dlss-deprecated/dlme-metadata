In his telegram at iixt.2893/45 the Political Resident asked that two of the key boxes should be sent by air. The boxes weigh 10 lus. b ozs. each, and I understand from Mr. Smith that there is no objection to them being despatched by air provided that this Department consiaers it to be a matter of sufficient urgency. If they were carried by B. O.A.G. , which is unlikely, the charge would be about 15 a piece, otherwise they go by Transport Command and no charge is made. In the meantime the India Stores Department wrote on 14th June to say that they had received a 'request for similar key boxes for Kabul (Ext.2900/45 )• 1 think that the Gulf has the prior claim on the four key boxes already ordered.

I concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Gardener and Captain Bazalgette that a new combination safe and a steel press are necessary at Khorramshahr, and I trust that it will be possible to supply these at an early date. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, (No. 65). I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) Horace J. Seymour.

From ray own Knowledge of the security arrangements at Khorraraehahr, I would fully endorse the opinions expressed by Captain Jiaaalgette. I have the honour therefor© to support hie request for a new combination safe and a steel filing cabinet* As ChorraiuBhahr is a post which is normally staffed and maintained by the Government of India, I do not icnow whether office equipment can be supplied to Khorraashahr by any home department.

We are expecting these key boxes to arrive in Zahidan shortly. 3. As the Vice-Consul, Birjand, does not hold cyphers (he only has the Government Telegraph Code) and the Consul-General does not now take cyphers to Birjand it is quite useless sending a key-box there. 4. The Vice-Consul, Meshed, has not been supplied with one and we are therefore instructing Zahidan to forward one to Meshed. We trust there will be no objection to this.

The present practice whereby the keys are carried on the person of the responsible officer has resulted on more than one occasion in the loss of keys, with the concomitant possibility of risk to confidential documents. I have therefore decided that all Missions and Consular posts which hold Foreign Office cyphers, which are in possession of key lock safes only and which are not already in possession of combination key boxes, shall be provided with the latter. 3. I request that you will furnish me as early as possible with a list of the posts under your supervision which in these circumstances will require combination key boxes.

You will by now have received our letters Nos. 470/1-1701 of August 22nd last and No.470/1-19/1, of September 6 th, giving respectively the dimensions of the safe and four padlocks for Kerman and of the single padlock for Mohammerah. 3 # From a perusal of the Chubb catalogue, we would imagine that the best safe for Kerman would be No. 11. It should be fitted with two drawers to lock and a single shelf, and have an ordinary combination lock. 4 . As regards the copies of Indian Stores Department indent enclosed in your letter under reference, owing to the extremely rare opportunities of a ’’safe hand * 1 to Kerman, we think it would be as well not|to delay matters by waiting for them to be filled in. We&gt; therefore hope that the information which we have already given you will enable you to proceed with the ordering and despatch of the safe and padlocks. 5 # In the matter of the route by which the two consignments should be despatched, w© would suggest that the padlock for Mohammerah be sent by bag to the Baghdad anbassy for onward transmission , while the safe and padlocks for Kerman be sent to the British Consulate at Bander Abbas.

Shiraz : Ho requirements; files of the Annual Reports tfnd other confidential documents are complete. jjander Abbas : j rwo Chubb padlocks are required. Kerman ; Two Chubb padlocks are required, also a new safe. The present safe is an extremely small one by Chubb (springlesa lever look with one key) and accommodation is so limited that some of the more rarely used among the cyphers and reoyphering tables have to be kept in the strong room of the Imperial Bank of Persia. This state of affairs is, I consider, very undesirable and I have the honour to request that the Consulate may be supplied with a combination safe. 2. I am enquiring whether the files at Kerman and Bander Abbas are complete.

Sir John Simon agrees that another safe is necessary for this post and I am to enquire whether the Government of India will agree to supply His Majesty's Consulate- General with a combination safe. I am Sir Your obedient Servant The Under Secretary of State India OfficeNo. 547 British Legation, Tehran. SECRET * 29th November, 1933. Sir, In reply to your despatch No. 364 of September 1st, I have the honour to state that I have investigated further the need for his Vajesty’s Consulate-General at Bushire to be supplied with a new safe. 2 . I find that there is no doubt at all that the present safe is inadequate. It is just large enough to contain the cyphers, tables, etcetera, belonging to the Consulate-General, but there are always on hand packages of recyphering tables destined for other Consulates in South Persia and at the moment the Bander Abbas cyphers are also at Bushire. 3. This state of affairs is inevitable in view of the fact that His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Bushire is largely used as a forwarding agency for other Consulates, and the result has been that some of the surplus tables and cyphers have had to be placed in the strong-room of the Imperial Bank of Persia. 4. This state of affairs does not seem to me at all satisfactory and I therefore venture to urge that a new safe be supplied. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Right Honourable (Signed) R. H.

O o SECRET Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he has had under consideration the adequate safeguarding of the cyphers and other confidential matter at the consular posts in Persia. 2. A report on the question which has been received from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran states that the accommodation at His Majesty’s Consulate-General, Meshed, consists of (1) a Chubb safe in good condition; used for cyphers, (2) a Russian-made safe of ancient design, secured by a lock, several trick appliances % S and a heavy iron bar secured oy a large brass Chubb padlock; used for less important documents and (3) a cupboard in good condition secured by a stout Chubb lock; used for ordinary confidential archives. 3. The present Consul General is unable, on tne information available to nim, to feel positive that there have never been more keys to (l) and (2) than are at present in his possession. His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran are of the opinion that in these circumstances the safes cannot be considered entirely burglar proof.Furthermore the records of this department show that there is one key unaccounted for. In these circumstances Sir Jonn Simon is of the opinion that a new combination safe should be supplied to this post. 4. In/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office* 4. In view of the considerations set forth above and the uncertain conditions prevailing in Persia, I am go enquire whetner one Government of India will agree to supply a new combination safe to his Majesty’s Consulaue-General, Meshed.
