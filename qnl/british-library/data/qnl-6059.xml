But we appreciate your view that over enthusiastic support might make Company’s position more difficult. we should prefer that warning to Shaikh should be to the effect that His Majesty’s Government will not consent grant a concession to any Company which is not (like Kuwait Oil Company) at least 50 % British. We are in a position to go further in the case of Kuwait, than in the case of UATAR which as you know falls with -in I.P.C. sphere under Oil Agreement , so that it was impossible to secure 50 c /a British participation. warning should be given orally and not in writing.

In continuation of my Confidential D.O.No.C-84, dated the 1st March 1934, I am sending this down to you to Bahrain by the hand of Imperial Airways pilot, so that you can get an idea how Chisholm and Holmes have progressed with their new draft 'Concession' since they arrived. 2. I shall send 4 copies of this direct to Bushire, and in anticipation of your approval, one copy, under private cover to Laithwaite by Westbound air mail so as to give him ^ first hand news of what is happening. i^k 5. As you already know the Kuwait Oil Company submitted their Draft Concession on 22nd February ana made no progress . at all up to the 8th March, the Shaikh showing by his manner, at every interview which took place, that he would discuss nothing until the Company 1 s representatives talked reason and offered much more attractive terras. 4. As both Holmes and Chisholm thought that perhaps the Shaikh was marking time until the arrival of the ' Polltical Agre em ent ' from London, I took the trouble to on Quire from him on 8th March when he came to soe me about sane other business, if this was so. 5. The Shaikh assured me that the non-arrival of the Political Agreement was not worrying him much, as he knew that His Majesty’s Uavernment had to safeguard both theirs and his interests; what was holding things up was the Question of the 'lump sum' to be paid on, signature . The Kuwait Oil Company must/ The Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.B. ,I.A., Political Resident in the lersian Gulf at Bahrain.( 2 )/ - 5 - initial payment on signature (’a* above): but I do not think the Shaikh will accept anything below Hs. 450 ,000. This, of course, is my private view only. Shaikh to agree to something reasonable as regards Royalty and Export Tax (’c* above), they should not waste time about the r &gt; initial figure ”, but should act big and generously. It is most important to my mind to arrive at a quick decision . Holmes, I believe, thinks, as I do, though Chisholm appears to be more keen on bargaining. In this matter I value Holmes opinion more than that of Chisholm, as he knows much more of the Shaikh’s psychologyleal 'make up”. 11. I have a shrewd suspicion that perhaps both Holmes and Chisholm think that I have been giving the Shaikh advice; needless to say I have done nothing of the kind. I am leaving him entirely to himself at present. 12. I have also noticed a sli$it tendency on the part of Holmes and Chisholm to distrust each other, which is a pity - this between ourselves . Holmes appears to be in favour of each of than seeing the Shaikh separately, but Chisholm does not agree. Holmes’ idea is that the Shaikh will ”thaw” some- udiat if he sees him alone , and complains that when they are both present together, the Shaikh is as stiff and non-committal as the pioverbial ’’poker”. After Note. 1 (1) Holmes told me on 9th March 19 34 and again on 13th March that the one great danger that he feared was that the Standard Oil Company of California should get ^atar. He was absolutely positive that they were exerting all their influence to get there and would in the end, get the concession unless His Majesty Government acted soon. I also think that provided the Company can get the(2) Holmes was equally positive that there was no immediate fear of any attack on the Kuwait Neutral Zone by the California people, he said, however that I could take it for a fact that the Americans (California Company) had told Bin Saud that they wanted him to give then first refusal in the matter, they having stated their willingness to 'top' any other companies offer by 10%, if made at any time what soever. With this I am inclined to agree and it bears out K.B.Ab&amp;il Latif's recent statement to me. You recollect he arrived back from Riath on 27th February. (He, as you know, is late Customs Director of Kuwait). (5) Incidentally Abdul Latif also brough back fran Bin Saud a document authorizing him to introduce any Company (Oil or otherwise) who were anxious to negotiate a concession with Bin Saud. Obviously Abdul Latif hopes to get the Kuwait Oil Company to nibble at the Neutral Zone, and has asked Bin Saud to let him do 'go between'. (4) Abdul Latif similarly hopes to get an 'Arms Concession' for the supply of rifles and munitions to the King. He is working for a Spanish firm as I told you when you were here. (5) Behind everything, and looming clearly above all else, is Bin Baud’s great need of money. Can we not turn this to account?Telegram I .F.O.Ex. 19 30 .

I am afraid that I do not approve of your sending a copy of your letter to Laithwaite. I have already said in another letter which goes to you by this mail that I do not like P.As writing demi-offidaily or privately to authorities outside Gulf on Gulf affairs, and if you will look up the correspondence re: your sending copies to the I.Q. you will see that I only agreed to this on certain definite conditions. Please observe these carefully. Unless these conditions are observed what will happen is that the habit of direct correspondence between P,A. f s and outside authorities will grow and the Resident will be reduced to a position of primus inter pares - one P.A. amongst other P.A.s which is most undesirable for many reasons.

As regards the last paragraph of the note, the effect of attributing not only the Barr-al-Qarah, but its hinterland, to Ibn Baud would, of course, be for practical purposes to move the Blue Line to the east to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay. 3.

Yours ever, GILBhPT LAITHMAITA,P.Z.1350/34. Note of discussion with Sir Perc;y Cox on 20tJi February on cuestion of boundaries of QATAR . Consequent on the recent investigations into the Southern boundary of ^atar Sir Percy Cox was good enough to come to the Inula Office on SOth February to discuss the conversations reported in Colonel Dickson's aespatch, Confidential No.143 of 4th July, to have taken place between Sir Percy, Ibn Saud ana Major Holmes, in November/December 1902. 2. Sir Percy Cox saia tnut he had kept no private notes as to what passed at nis meeting with Ion Sauu on the occasion in question, anything he had reported or recorded on the subject would have been left on the record at Baghdad; but to the best of his recollection ana belief the facts and circumstances were as follows: The specific object with which, accompanied by Iraq representatives, he went to meet Ibn Saud at Ojair was to induce him to ratify the Mohammerah Agreement of 5th May 1922. Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without any knowledge that he would there meet Major Holmes or would have occasion to express any opinion as to the boundaries of the qatar Peninsula; but learning from Major Holmes, and from the map that he produced, that he was endeavour ing to obtain from Ion Saua a concession for exploiting oil in an area wnxch included the Qatar Peninsula, he (Sir Percy Cox) naturally informed Major Holmes - and no doubt Ibn Saud also - that this could not be. if he had then been asked, as he doubtless must have been, what he considered should oe excluded, as constituting Qatai , sir Percy would undoubtedly have based his answer on his own knowledge, as Besiaent in the Persian Gulf for nany years; namely, that, on the : east coast, Qatar’s boundary/boundary with the .sheikh of Aou Lhahi's territory was the head of the Khor-al-Oaaia 9 ana on the west coast the head of Salwa Bay. Tnis, in Sir Percy’s recollection, was the position recognised in the Bushire residency ana adopted hy Lorimer in trie Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Sir Percy prohahly had the Gazetteer with him, Put on the above point he woula hardly have needeu to consult it. In any case he is positive that the angle~Turkish Blue Line of 191S was never mentionea, ana is of opinion that any view which he expressed incidentally ana ex tempore coula not reasonably be regarded as the official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary contemplated in our first treaty with Ibn Saud (December 1915) in which it figured as one of those to be '’hereafter determined'. Moreover, sir Percy Cox states that he informed both Ion Saua and major Holmes that H.L.G. ought to be consulted before any concession was granted. Sir Percy said that in tnese circumstances it seemed to him that H.M,G. were entirely free, in so far as the conversations of 192L were concerned, to maintain against Ion Saua the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, as tne Lastern boundary of Nejd. Sir Percy saia he was not aware whether either Ibn Saud or the shaikh of patar haa ever advanced a definite claim to the ownership of tne 3arr-al-Qarah coastal tract, between Zakhnuniyeh and Salwa, but it seemed to him that if occasion arose in the future for a compromise it would be a reasonable course to assign to Ibn Saud, m view of nis strong position at Ojair close by, that length of coast line with its hinterland, up to tne Blue Line. This woula have the advantage of leaving no inaeterminate area along the sea-coast. INDIA OFFICE. 27th February 1934. J.G, LAITH7/AITE.P_._ Z. 1775/5 4. St hMarch, 1954. DtiAFT OF KUWAIT CONCESSION.

It is very satisfactory that no difficulty should arise about landing grounds (b) and (c), and, subject to your views, we are of opinion that it would be desirable at once to take advantage of the Sheikh's offer to loan them indefinitely to Government without rent subject to the proviso mentioned. 3. It is, of course, for the Air Ministry to say how much importance tney attach to securing area (a), but prima facie there would seem, if your financial authorities agree, to be much to be said for taking up at once with the the Sheikh the question of what rent he would demand in respect/ mg Commander WhA. McClaughry, D• S• 0•, M,#0♦, D.i .c., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway,respect of it. If we do not take advantage of the offer which has now been made to us it seems highly prohahle that, in view of the value of the area to the Oil Company, cis stated in 'thirdly n of Dickson's telegram, they will he anxious to secure it for their own purposes and it woulu prohahly he difficult for us to refuse to allow them to make use of it if we haa on our siae failed to take advantage of the offer now reported to have been made hy the Sheikh. Would you he so kind as to let me know what your view is about tnis and what action you would like us to take? 4. As regards the last paragraph of Dickson's telegram, it is in our view unnecessary to insert any special reference to these landing grounds in the Political Agreement, the terms of Clause 8 of which in its present form will cover all the areas in question if we decide to come to an arrangement with the Sheikh in respect of them. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Yours sincerely, J,G, LAITHWAITD»P.Z.1047/34.

Sth January, 19^4. Fy dear Christopher» ^* thl© la oupplmmutary to ay letter of Deoetiher ^0 about oil concessions* 1 Phllhy again on January 8 * He did not appear to t^ave unearthed any copy of the unpublished agreement between the b&amp;'tidi Government and standard Oil of California. He profeaaad to have It all pretty well by heart but what he told me did not *H|ture very well with, what ho had previously told Calvert, as recorded in the letter sent you by the latter on December 11. It will be remembered that Philby was then speaking from memory without preparation, and that Calvert recorded what he understood him to have eald also from memory. There was there/ore some obscurity in part of Calvert f ® letter. I would ask you to regard what follows as being the sip total of our present knowledge here, stated, in consultation with Calvert, in the light of our latest information. / 1. It seem© reasonably certain that the £38,000 gold already paid over consists, as to f 50,000, of the whole or part of the loan contemplated in Article 3 of the published concession, and, as to £5,000, of the first instalment of the rent contemplated In article 4. There is good reason to believe that the £50,000 is only the first portion of the preliminary loan, but it is not clear what the total Is or when the reminder is to be paid, fh-iby now seeise to think that a second portion r cm ins to be paid but will not be payable until 18 months after the first. I suggested to him that the preliminary loan was a loan only In the sense that it would come into aettlament with the loans contemplated In .rtlole 8, if oil were in fact discovered in oommercial quantities, but that if oil wore not so discovered it would accrue definitely to the Government for/ Earner, &amp;sq., Foreign Office, o.^.l.for having granted the concerns ion. Philhy agreed that, In the latter contingency. It night not in practice be recoverable, but thought that there; «ae an agreem-nt ttiat it should be repaid in annual inetalaentB, if the oonceeeian eventually lapsed, vbilby aid not revert an January 6 to tlie suggestion he eteem to Imve m&amp;e an Peoessber 6 that a final payiseiit o.? i,B0 9 QQO would fall due after two years* *fhi© mmy have been an anticipation based on the hope that oil might be produced In comerc tal quantities after that la pee of time* vnyhow phllby now- seems to agree that after the preliminary loan has been completed as above* the next loan© will be those contemplated in Article a of the published concession* We have no solid informtion as to their amount but It le quite possible that these loan© are to be f50,000 gold each. $. Philby endorsed on January 6 what Fuad had told me on December 29 (fee my telegram Ho.ifB of December 30) regarding the position in regard to the Kuwait Heutral rone. He knew a good deal about Ydllbl and wwayni’s mis©lean to Riyadh# He did not know the composition of Ydlibi’e syndicate but thought that Holmes was In with him. (Of. para.B of my telegram Ho. 226 of December 30). He had seen In passing a very formal looking doeunent In English a ad Arabic, part I imagine of isaynl's credentials. Fuad had mentioned to me a document proving the actual formation of the Ydllbi ryndioate, which had been legalised in Egypt# Philby had alr?o heard that the authorities her# had dangled before Ydllbi a prospect of connecting the oil deal with a settlement of debts for good®. All this if* obscure, m It is not at all certain even that Ydlibi la owed any substantial rum of money f but he thought that perhaps the King was ©ailing a bit close to the wind, as, if he reached any/'''i , — 0 i,ay t, in nrimtp'U with YdHbi t he wmxla hkVe to offer to lvm*l with 3t*m&amp;&amp;rd Oil of California praf*x**ntlally in rogard to the terms, TMIby thought th^t Bt^miard Oil would then take the business on. I am not so sure of this myself# unless the terns very moderate.

Immediate i IHDIA OFFICE, $ HI IEHALL, * W. 1 21st February 1934* We sent to the Admiralty today copy of a draft in simple legal form for the contemplated agreement bet¥#een His Majesty’s Government and the Koweit Oil Company. The question who should sign this on behalf of His Majesty’s Government is for further consideration. he shall probably consult the Admiralty, the Foreign Office and the Petroleum Department officially on this, and perhaps suggest that it should be signed by one of our Under-Secretaries 5 if you and the other Departments concurred officially in this, we should then have the authority of four Ministers for its signature, and I suppose this would be quite adequate authority for a signature purporting to be on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. 2. fhe representatives of the Koweit Oil Company are anxious to see the draft if possible before Mr. Stevens leaves London for America on Friday night. If we can arrange a meeting with them on Thursday or Friday, wq can give them the draft, and also discuss with them the additional clauses for insertion in the commercial agreement which have formed the subject of my correspondence with you ending with your letter of 31st January, M.0145/34. 3. We think that we should propose a clause for insertion in the commercial agreement of a simple character to the following effect:- «Xt is hereby declax*ed that so far as the terms of this agreement are inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Seal, Esq., Admiralty2 the Company (which agreement is set out in the Schedule hereto) the terms of uhis agreement shall be subordinate to and controlled by the terms of the agreement between His Majesty 1 s Government and the Company.” 4 , It will be unnecessary to insert a clause to provide that the commercial agreement shall not come into force until the agreement between the Company ana the Government is concluuedj because it is now clear that the latter agreement will oe xeadiy for conclusion before the other one. it will probably s^e convenient to arrange for their simultaneous execution. 5. As regards point (a) mentioned in your letter of Cist January, we now have Clause 2 of the agreement between the Company and the Government, under which the former may not transfer their agreement with the Sheikh to any , without the prior consent of His Majesty^ Government. ~sU Majesty 1 s Government would thus have the opportunity, if any such transfer were proposed, to make it a condition that the transferee Company inherited all the undertakings given by the parent company to His Majesty 1 s Government. As an additional Bute guard, however, tjg might propose to insert in the preamble to the agreement between the Company ...net. Hiu Majesty 1 s Government the words underlined in the copy whicn is enclosed herewith. 6 . As regards point (b) in your letter of 31st January, the question of expressing some sanction for enf orcement of the Government agreement is one of great difficulty* might perhaps try for the insertion in Article 11 of the commercial agreement, after (A) (c), of words to the following effect;- ”(d) If the Company terms of the agreement shall fail to observe any of the concluded between the Company and Ihe/ His Majesty’s Government.”- 3 diIfxcuX*ty wiiioli 'we ses is 'tiiati ihe Company's representatives may naturally object that this gives His Majesty’s Government an arbitrary power to determine the concession if in their opinion there has been failure to observe any of the terms of the Government agreement, though it might be open to dispute whether such failure had occurred o.i not. o oi example, it might oe a disputable point whether or not the Company had observed Clause 3 of the Government agreement, as thisjoiight turn on such a fine point as whether the consent of His Majesty’s Government to the employment ox a particular foreigner was reasonably or unreasonably withheld. On the other hand, we could, I suppose, argue that the arbitrary power of His Majesty’s Government to secure the determination of the concession would be limited by the arbitration clause (Article 18) of the commercial agreement. If the Sheikh (under our advice) claimed that the concession should be terminated under the suggested addition to Article 11, and the Company disputed it, the dispute would be arbitrable as a matter of the interpretation of Article 11; this would raise a question of fact whether or not the Company had failed to observe Clause 3 (or whichever it was) of the Government agreement, and the interpretation of this clause also would in this way come before the arbitrator. 7.

I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of 19th January, No .E.318/189/91 regarding the application of the Koweit Oil Company for the grant of a concession from the Sheikh of Koweit. As a result of negotiations with the Company, in which representatives of your Department have been associated, provisional agreement has been reached on the terms of the undertakings which the Company are prepared to give to His Majesty’s Government in the event of their obtaining the 1/ concession. These terms are embodied in the draft agreement / between His Majesty’s Government and the Company of which copy is enclosed herewith. The representatives of the Company have also agreed to include in the draft of their proposed agreement with the Sheikh (copy of which has been communicated to your Department) additional clauses to the following effect (l) The insertion in Article 11 A, which provides for the cases in v^hich the concession may be terminated, ol the following sub-clause:- '(d) If the Company shall fail to observe any of the terms of an agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government signed in London (2) The addition of an article in the following terms:- 'It/ Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W. 1.'It is herety declared that so far as the terms of this agreement are inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of an agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government signed in London on ........... the terms of this agreement shall he subordinate to and controlled by the terms of that agreement between the Company, and His Majesty’s Government”. 3* Mr. Stevens, of the Gulf Oil Corporation, who has been joined with the representatives of the Anglo Persian Oil Company in conducting the negotiations on behalf of the Koweit Oil Company, is anxious to be able to sign the agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government before his return to America. Though he was due to sail this week, he has postponed his departure till Wednesday, 28th February, in order that there may be an opportunity of considering whether arrangements can be made for the execution of the agreement on behalf of His Majesty’s Government before that date. 4. Sir Samuel Hoare for his part feels fully satisfied that the terms ol the proposed agreement adequately secure the essential desiderata of His Majesty’s Government, and the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who have been consulted on the substance of the terms, share this view, Colonel Fowl© having stated his opinion that the agreement is most staisfactoiy» In these circumstances, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that, if, as be Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agrees to the loposed terms, there would be considerable advant g aking the opportunity offered by Mr. Stevens’s willingness o sign at once and in arranging accordingly if possible,3. lor the execution ol tne agreement before he retui'ns to America. 5. ■ ab regards the manner in which the agreement should be executed on behalf or His Majesty’s Government Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that, if the other Ministers concerned concur, he might authorise its signature by one of the Under Secretaries of State at the India Office, and that such authorisation by the four Departments primarily concerned would constitute a sufficient authority for the execution of the agreement, in the manner suggested, on behalf of His Majesty’s =Government. 6 . Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful for a very early reply to this letter, in order that if at ail possible the agreement may be executed before Mr. Stevens’s return to America. 7.

P.Z.1639/34 . A/0 ./1 I 4 y dear George, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 12th March 1904. /lA Many tp&amp;riks for your letter of the 8 th March/ E.1201/160/91. I am sorry for the misunderstanding about the telegram to the Political Resident on the Koweit oil concession, which I had incorrectly assumed that we had agreed. The telegram, as I explained, issued on the 7 th, but we sent &lt;•- zt de^tr-nig-ht a supplementary telegram-asking Powle and Dickson to suspend action (if they have not already taken it) pending receipt of a further telegram. 2., We have carefully considered the views set out in your letter under reply, but we still think that the right course is that suggested in the draft telegram and our reasons are the following. 3 , In the first place, we feel that in a matter sucn as this, we must be guided by Powle, who on the one hand fully appreciates (for he has copies of all correspondence and has keen in close touch with us throughout) the possibility 01 difficulties with the Americans and the point ox view held at this end, but who, on the other, is in close personal touch with the Sheikh, knows the local situation and is the best judge of what is or is not likely to conduce to achieve the ends whioh we both desire. Powle has emphatically recommended in the first place that we should not overemphasise the strength of our support for the Koweit Oil Company, because to do so would defeat its own ends. Secondly, that it i£ impoitant to give the Sheikh a warning in the terms he su 00 ^-'t o th&amp;t '' has/ [‘Mendel, Esq., C.M.G., ^neign Office,, S.W.l.lias not an entirely free hand as regards thefdisposal of his oil concession. His telegram of 6th March, 287, which was received after our meeting, further emphasises the importance of some warning on these lines. 4. We recognise the attractiveness of your suggestion that we should tell the Sheikh in so many words that we will give our consent to the grant of a concession by him to no company other than the K owe it Oil Company. But, attractive as this may appear to be, we doubt if it is practical politics. Quite apart from the fact that it would in our view be unfair to present the Sheikh with an ultimatum of this type (we have to consider his financial interests and the terms of our treaties with him) and that its effect on our general relations with him might well be veiy embarrassing, we think we should probably entirely fail to secure our object. The Sheikh might reply that in the circumstances he would give the concession to no one, and the next stage would ioe that in a year’s time or so we should find that he was in close toucn with the Standard Oil, had compromised himself with them, and that it would be impossible for us to refuse our appioval to the grant of a concession by him to them, a concession, moreover, in connection with which we should not be able to get safeguards anything like as satisfactory .as those which we have got out of the Kowe it Oil Company. 5. w e fully appreciate the possible difficulties with the United States Government: they have been present to us throughout. But we cannot agree, as I made cleai at the meeting, that a warning such as that proposeo. could 0 iv United States Government any ground for complaint on the ^asis in which were that/ of the 1932 correspondence, the only pledgestha t we abandoned our right to require that any concession should be given to an exclusively British company. We have now, a s Fowls has pointed out, admitted American capital, and there can be no iea^onable suggestion that we are maintaining a 'closed door* policy, and it is open to us, on the ground of local cono.il/iono, to impose restrictions as to the conditions under which such capital shall operate in the Sheikhdom. In any case, even ii we were to avoid dif^ioulty on this score in Koweit, we should certainly have to face the issue in the near future in Qatar, and while there may be a difference in the circumstances of the two Sheikhdoms, it is a difference of degree rather than of principle and in any case what critics will look at is the substance of any restriction rather than our special reasons for it. But we should in both cases justify our attitude not, as suggested in paragraph 5 of your letter, on the ground that we are anxious to benefit British as opposed to American enterprise, but on the ground that we hav special responsibilities in these areas, and that having regard to this we must within reason prescribe the terms on which foreign capital or foreign nationals shall be employed in them. °» For these reasons, we feel strongly that the instruction in our telegram to Fowle of 7th March should be allowed to stand and we regard it as important, in the interests of making the position clear to the Sheikh, that the Resident should be allowed to make the necessary communication to the Sheikh with as little delay as possible . We trust that in view of the QXplanation I have given above you will now be prepared to agree. Yours ever, GILBERT LAITMAITE.CONFIDENTIAL.

( ,ir, &lt; 7 \ V I haye the honour to refer you to my Confidential Letter No.C-126, dated the 7th April 19 34 and to my telegram No. 128, dated the 9th April 1934. 2. I now forward for your information copies of the following telegrams in co ..rection wiHi the visit to Kuwait of the German Minister, French Charge’ d’Afiaires, and drench Consular Agent, Basra on 8th April, which were received by me after I had sent off my Confidential No.C-126 to you informing you that I had n put off n the party. ^ \l\ (a) Telegram No.l dated 6th April 1934 from H.k's Ambassador, Baghdad, (received late in evening on 6th April)* h- ivk (b) Telegram No.1*11, dated 7th April (received 7.30 P*M.) from H#B.M’s Conail, Basra. yfo * ^ ^ / Telegram No. Nil, dated 7th April (received { ] on 8^ April) 'from the Freud! Consular Agent, Basra. 3. Telegrams (a) and (b) above were received by me afte despatch of my telegram No.Nil of 6th April to Monsieur Asfar, French Consular Agent, Basra. So X think I hatl d riji. presume that my informing him that there was no accommodation available in Kuwait for the visitors would have be* taken due notice of. , i \ a-rrivpd an hour before the party 4. Telegram (c) arrived an xiutuparty reached Kuwait. 5. For your further information, I beg to say that on receipt of Monsieur Asfar’s letter of 3rd April (on 6th April) and as soon as I had sent off my reply on 6th, I called on the bhaikh who was camped 7 miles away with his family and informed him of the situation* He expressed his most profuse gratitude at the action I had taken, saying that he could not possibly have entertained any members of the parly as his Palace in Kuwait was closed, 6. It therefore came as an unpleasant shock to His Excellency when I had to inform him by hurried private note on the morning of the 8th that the party was arriving inspite of my telegram putting than off. Not only did he express considerable annoyance to me when he saw me later in the day, but he asked how it was that I, his Political Agent, appeared unable to stop Europeans from coming down, who were not wanted by him or me, 7. While I have given you the above details of utiat happened, the point I wish to bring out most of all is the unfortunate way this visit has been arranged. Clearly it was fixed up on the spur of the moment, and neither the Shaikh convenience nor mine was in the slightest degree considered, 8. A still more important point to my mind is the fact that you, the Political Resident in the Persian culf and my Chief, were neither informed nor consulted, which in the case of distinguished personage^ like the (Herman iiinister and French Charge 1 d'affaires in 'Iraq, appears to me to be strangely lacking in courtesy. 9. The Shaikh also noticed this omission, and aptly, I think, remarked that it was rather curious that proper steps had not been taken, as in the case oj the American Minister, to acquaint him of the coming arrival in his Capital of important foreigners of ministerial rank. 10 ./- — - 3 - 10. As things turned out, the party which arrived, con^ sisted of (a) Dr, G-robba (and wife), German Minister; (b) Monsieur Lepissier (and wife) French Chare© 1 d f Affaires; (c) Dr •Hermann ueaho, , German DdMcaticnsl Expert attached to ’Iraq Government; (d) Monsieur Asfar, French Consular Agent, Basra: and X did my best to entertain them and show them round the V- Town personally, although I could offer them no food, as X had another large luncheon party on, consisting of Captain and Mrs*Howes, American Missionaries and Imperial Airways Officers (latter stranded here)* lie The party neither called on,nor left cards for, the Shaikh, and left again for Basra at 2 P*M. Monsieur Asfar before leaving apologized privately fer the invasion, which he had done his best to stop on receipt of my wire* 12* Whilst in my house, Dr*Grobba and the French Charge’ d’Affaires put one or two very pointed questions regarding the activities of the new Kuwait Oil Company, and appeared to be perfectly aware of who Major Holmes and Mr*Chisholm were* They also asked whether it was true that the Political Resident was about to take up his residence at Bahrain. 13.

Oil interests and the recent visit of Mr.Knabenshue , American Minister in T Iraq to Kuwait. Sir, With reference to the recent visit of the above named distinguished personage to Kuwait on 28th March 1934, I have the honour to report some interesting points which, I think, may be found of interest to His Majesty’s Government. (a) Major Holmes informed me after the Minister’s departure that Mr.Knabenshue ’ s Secretary at a luncheon party given in my house,asked him about the ’’Red Line Agreement”, and whether Kuwait could not be properly considered as falling within same. M#jar Holmes said that he ’’rode him off” tactfully, and gave an evasive reply, (in this connection see Foreign Office,London No. 123, dated 22.3.34 to Sir Percy Loraine, Bart., K.C.MG, etc., Angora). (b) Mr.Knabenshue, on more occasions than one took the trouble to emphasize to me rather more strongly than appeared necessary that his visit to the vrulf and especially to Bahrain and Kuwait was entirely unconnected with Oil, thou^i some people seemed to think it was. (c) Mr .Knahenshue, before he left, asked my advice c*s to what would he the best course for him to follow, should Bln Saud either die or have a reverse or defeat in Yemen, when presumably there would be a period of chaos in the interior, which would certainly endanger the lives American Geologists andV m y all communications to be addressed to tije company KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LIMITED.

( With reference to Secretary of State for India’s telegram No.963^dated 17th (received 18th) April to your address I have the honour to enclose for your information, copies of the following letters which recently passed bet ween the representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company and myselx also between His Excellency the Shaikh and the Kuwait Oil Comijany, regarding articles 11 A(d) and 20, which the Company tried to get the Shaikh to introduce into the commercial agreement and which the shaikh has written to say that he will not agree to* ^ ^ ^ u \% - ^ (a) Copy of letter dated 10th Aril 1934 frcm Kuwait i Oil Company, Kuwait to the Political Agent, (b) Copy (enclosure to (a)) of letter fhom Kuwait Oil Company, Kuwait to His Kr.cellency the ohai^h, dated the 10th April; ^ ti, : , 5 A (c) Copy of Kuwait Oil Company (aKuwait's letter, dated 12th iipril 1934, to the Political Agent, (d) Copy of Hie Hxoelleney the shaikh* s fetter No. R/3/1472, dated 11th April, to the Kuwai uix fompanv Kuwait (which was obtained later ana seraraKly f rom the Kuwait Oil Company by me) . ^ - c J%0 ^ ! he letters speak for themselves* C tk if 2 , The letters speaK xor uuoiuo^j-v- / 3. In three long discussions which I subsequently had with Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm, 1he latter think, and I cannot but see their point, that the long delay in giving the Shaikh the Political Agreement (50 days after the^ presentation of the Commercial Agreement) coupled- 2 - their having had to present articles 11(A) (d) and 20 to the Shaikh 48 days after first placing the Commercial Agreement befoie him, .tilled him with the greatest suspicion and led him to act as he did. 4* I have not seen the bh&amp;lkh since the receipt of* His Majesty’s Secretary of State for- India’s telegram Ho. 963, and of course have taken no action pending receipt of orders from you. 5. I am a little bit anxious however, lest the Shaikh when I do eventually deliver His Majesty’s Government’s message to him, may take things rather unkindly and possibly try and do something rash such as closing down all further negotla tions. io avoid ell chances of such a contingency, I propose approaching the matter very cautiously in the first place, and if I find the Shaikh reasonable and receiving what I say well, I shall go full speed ahead. 6. One must admit, I think, that the Shaikh (who like all Nejdis is most suspicious and proud by nature) cannot but have felt that he has been rather scurvily treated, if we impartially examine the dates on which the various documents and amendments were submitted to him. These read as follows: (a) On 22nd February the Commercial Agreement is given to him. (b) On 10th April he is asked by the Kuwait Oil Company to introduce two further and important Articles into the Commercial Agreement, after he has discussed and thrashed out every single item, time and again over a period of several weeks with Messrs: Chisholm and Holm.es and never been given an inkling that further new articles would be introduced. (c) Lastly after being carefully told by yourself and me that the Political Agreement would follow the Commercial Agreement with as as possible, he is only given it on l«oth iipril. 6. What apparently also added to the Shaikh s fiique was the fact that the Company’s representatives maae out to him that the articles were being inserted by the Company- 3 - Company’s wish, ^ien in reality it was His Majesty’s Government’s desire that they should be put in. Had the negotiators told him the truth at the time, I do not think the Shaikh would have thrown out the proposed articles as he did. 7. If the Shaikh receives my”approach” conversation in a sensible and reasonable manner (that is to say if I get him in good mood) I think I shall have little difficulty in talking him round to His Majesty’s Government’s point of view, but it will be necessary, I think, to avoid anything of a ’’minatory” or ”big stick” attitude if I am to be success ful. B. If I find him 'difficult” I shall go slow and leave the door open for a further talk. 9. In the meantime I shall await orders from you.

The Shaikh listened to what I had to say attentively and throughout our subsequent conversation and discussion, which lasted over 1* hours he showed reasonableness, shrewd sense and a keen desire to understand His Majesty's Government point of view and to be himself understood.3. k&amp; I had suspected to be the case, 'Arab Pride', that stumbling block to so many people, seems to have been at the bottom of the 'Clauses' trouble, and the Shaikh appeared to me by no means as difficult or unreasonable as the local negotiators of the Kuwait Oil Company would seem to have given their London principals to understand* This probably is due to the fact that neither of the Kuwait Oil Company negotiators knows Arabic and both have to rely on interpreters* 4. Yfrien I had finished communicating what I had to say, the Shaikh began by quietly telling me that he had felt very keenly the lack of consideration shorn him by the Kuwait Oil Company, in the matter of the introduction of Articles 11(A) (d) and 20* Messrs,Chisholm and Holmes, the Company’s local trusted Agents had apparently been sent out to negotiate the commercial Agreement, and had never been told there were other clauses to be insertedj and that after he (the Shaikh) and the negotiators had gone through, every clause of the Agreement time and again over a period of 48 days, and had ocme very near to a successful conclusion, the Kuwait Oil Company’s London principals write out and instruct their men to introduce two entirely new clauses, as a sort of after thought and with the obvious intention of tying in some way or other to make the commercial Agreement appear subordinate to the Agreement which His Majesty’s Government had made with the Company, when it was quite obvious that it would always be so subordinate* 5. As regards the late delivery of the Political Agreement (it had been promised him somewhere about the 15th February and had only been given on ISApril), the Shaikh said that he did not wish to say much, but he could not out feel that there was something behind the delay which savoured of keeping him in the dark. Now that he had got it, however, he had no comments to make on the various articles, safeguard, etc., which all seemed good. 6 ./6 . The Shaikh then turned to points (a), (b) and (c) of the Secretary of States telegram under reference, and I give below and in seme detail his reactions. _(.a) 5 QFtion of Articles 11(A) (d) and 20. The Shaikh said that he had nothing whatsoever to say against the Articles in themselves, but felt strongly that the insertion in his commercial Agreement, which would of course be published to t he world , of any clauses making mention of_His Majesty’s Government by name, especially *foen such suggested that ultimate control of the concession lay wiih. His Majesty’s viovemment, would gravely prejudice his good name and prestige in the eyes of fellow Arab Rulers, and would almost be interpreted as the signing away of his independence. Nor would His Majesty’s Government’s good name for fair dealing escape criticism. He (the Shaikh) would became the laughing stock of Bin Saud and other^ who would say ’’Brother Ahmad is not allowed to make even a simple commercial Agreement with a foreign business firm, without the British stepping in and forcing him to insert certain by your leave clauses”. He had no objection to His Majesty’s Government 'tying him up”, as much as she chose, both in the Political Agreement or by other secret document. What he feared was publicity of such control clauses. He had promised and would again promise to show the eamnercial Agreement as finally agreed upon between himself and the Kuwait Oil Company, to His Majesty’s Government, before he actually put his signature to it, therefore it seemed to him that His Majesty’s Government could perfectly easily and definitely insure that no offending clause, would get into the commercial Agreement, which would conflict in any way wilh their Political Agreement. Surely this was enou^i. He begged and trusted that His Majesty’s Government would understand his standpoint, which was one affecting his ”Sharaf” (pride or honour) and which in no way affected his/8./ his loyalty, or his desire to please His Majesty’s Government. (b) Local Representative . The negotiators had clearly misunderstood him, said the Shaikh, All that he had wished to insure (in making his verbal request to the negotiators) was that he should not be n ^liM. en ro ^h shod over;: (Ms words) and that a person who was ignorant of the Arabic language, or Arab Customs or was actually a persona non grata to himself, should not be appointed as the Company’s local Representative. He merely desired that the selection of such local Representative should be made by His Majesty’s G-ovemment and the Company in full ccn saltation with himself, and that if he did not like a man or conversely liked a particular person, some notice should be taken of his wishes. This, said the Shaikh, was after all his undoubted right as Ruler of the State and as the 'granter of the concession'. (c) Offer fron another Oil Company. The Shaikh admitted that he had received a telegram from London, purporting to come from an all British concern. The latter had asked permission to opaa negotiations, and offered over 5 lacs of rupees on his signing^ as well as other equally favourable terms. He could not divulge name of Company even to me, but would say that he had replied that he cculd not consider the the offer unless negotiations with the Auwait Oil Company showed signs of breaking dovm altogether. 7. The Shaikh again and again reiterated that he was most anxious to come to terms with the Kuwait Oil com pany, as he knew this would please His Majesty’s Crovemment and give them satisfaction, but the Kuwait Oil Company should be told by someone^not to conduct their negotiations (as they were doing) on the assumption that 'they had eliminated all competitors frcm the field through being supported by His Majesty ’s Government:’, (his woras).8. The Shaikh went on to say that unless the Kuwait Oil Compsny hurried up &amp;i&amp; 1 settled matters, other companies would clearly very shortly be coming along as competitors, all with good British credentials. 9. The Shaikh finally assured me that he perfectly well understood that only an all British or a 50/50 British Company would be allowed by His Majesty’s Government to compete for the Kuwait Oil Concession, and said that the Standard Oil Company of California were out of the picture altogether and that I need not fear them. 10. Before leaving, I asked the Shaikh if he could not possibly as a personal favour to me and because he knew I wished him well, agree to the insertion of Article 11(A) (d) and 20 ; or at least one of them. I (rather unfairly perhaps) stressed the fact that by doing so, he would be winning His Majesty’s Government’s entire approbation. he could not,and would prefer to have no Oil Concession at all than act against his own and his family’s interests. c opy, with compliments, to the Secretary, Political Pepartmen India Office, ‘/hitehall, London.

I3HALREC0ED A meeting took place at the India Office on 17th April with representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company to discuss the present position of the Company's negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait, Present: Sir Louis Kershaw Air. n.C . Starling Mr. J.G.Laithwaite ) Mr. GcE.. Crombie ) Mr. Stevens Mr. Lefroy (in the Chair) Petroleum Department India Office. Kuwait Oil Company. MiL*.—Stevens produced a telegram which the Company had received from their negotiators in Kuwait (copy attached). The Shaikh had objected to the clauses in the commercial agreement which referred to the agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government viz. Article 11 A (d) (providing for cancellation in the event of the Company failing to carry out the terms of the Government Agreement) and Article 20 (providing that the commercial agreement should be subordinate to and controlled by the terms of the Government agreement) on the ground that the commercial agreement was separate from the Government agreement and that these clauses were therefore unnecessary. Mr. Stevens suggested that the difficulty might be got over if these two clauses were covered in an agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government but Sir Louis Kershaw explained that since His Majesty's Government were not parties to the commercial agreement these sanctions must appear in that agreement. He proposed however that the India Office should send instructions for the Political Agent to explain to the / /the Shaikh the tout'd n-F h-dq n pur p Oot. of the Government agreement, point out that the clauses in question were in the Shaikh' inoerest and inform him that Hi s own s Majesty’s Government 'would insist on oimilai clauses in any concession which might he granted by the Shaikh to any Company. ifith reference to the Shaikh's economic demands it was explained that these were a matter between the Shaikh and tne Company and that His Majesty's Government were not interested. Mr_ v Steyeng said that as regards financial terms Hie Shaikh and the. Company were not now very far apart. Mru^S^oyens was disturbed by the reference in the telegram from Kuwait to an offer having been made to the Shaikh by a ”100/o Briti sh •Company” . Mr. Starling did not think that the British Oil Development Company^ the British interest in which was about 51 per cent, could be interested in obtaining a concession in Kuwait. It was possible ? however^ that if the British Oil Development were inplicated in the matter the Shaikh might have been misled by the name of the Company into thinking that it was 100 per cent. British, The possibility was discussed of the Eastern and General or the Arabian Oil Development Syndicates having made some offer to the Shaikh. Mr. Stove ns said that he felt satisfied that there was no risk of this. Sir Louis Kershaw said that His Majesty’s Government had no information of any such offer being made to the Shaikh Dy any Company other than the Kuwait Oil Company. He assured Mr. Stevens that the consent of His Majesty’s Government would Be necessary for the grant of a concession by the Shaikh to any Company whatever its nationality. There was, ho we \ 0 r, no objection to the Political Agent being instructed to remind the /3. the Shaikh of this* Mr«. EtcYeas said that the Shaikh had asked for a Director on the Board of the Kuwait Oil Company in London. He saw great objection to this proposal since, in view of the 50/50 composition of the Bo, rd it would give the Shaikh's 'Director a deciding voice. c h 1 • Stev ens referred to a on ..hioh had already ouon mentioned to Mr. Walton by Mr. Kemp of the Anglo Persian Oil Company that the Shaikh might be invited to pay a visit to this country as the guest of the Kuwait Oil Company. Mr. Stevens was himself of opinion., with which Sir Louis Kershaw agreed^ that the Kuwait Oil Company would be going outside their proper sphere in making such an invitation to the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite added that an invitation to the Shaikh of Kuwait might embarrass His Majesty’s Government by encouraging the other Shaikhs to expect similar invitations. Mr. Stevens said that the best solution would probably be to offer the £ Mdk a lump sum representing the cost of a visit and leave it to him to do as he thought fit. In answer to an enquiry from Sir Louis Kershaw about the ’’textual alterations” in the commercial agreement referred to in the Company’s telegram from Kuwait ? Mr. Stevens promised that when these changes ? which were of minor importance ? had been finally agreed the agreement would be submitted again to His Majesty’s Government for approvals Mr. Steven s said that the Shaikh was now asking that the Chief Local Representative should be a British subject appointed for five years after consultation with and subject to 'the approval of the Shaikh himself* whereas in the Company’s agreement with His Majesty’s Government it v/as laid down that the appointment should be subject to the approval of the lattci■m SilLLouj^Kergh^ said that this was a matter on which His Majesty's Government could not give way. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that in the Bahrein agreement the Shaikh had no rights of approval or dismissal of the Chief Local Representative. Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that the position might he eased if the Political Agent were instructed to tell the Shaikh that while His Majesty's Government could not admit any right of approval or disapproval on his part they would, as a matter of courtesy inform him in advance of any appointment to the post of Chief Local Representative, so that he might have an opportunity to make any comments. Sir Louis Kershaw said that he did not like the suggestion made in the telegram that the discussions with the Shaikh might he postponed for two or three months. Mr, Stevens also did not favour this suggestion. It was agreed that theCompany should wait and see the effect of the • i telegram from the India Office instructing the Political Agent to intervene in the discussions. The conclusion of the meeting was that the India Office should at once tele.graph to the Political Resident on the lines of the telegram No. ^() Z- dated a copy is attached. It was agreed that the Company might inform their negotiators of the instructions which were being sent to i-he Political Agent.■ ■■III IMIU P. Z.£559/34.

(3) your views on Shaikh of Kuwait terms ref, to your telegrams Nos.7 and 9. Regarding (l) above Shaikh of Kuwait refused and has confirmed refusal in writing to a.ccept additions on the grounds that Government agreement is separate from commercial agreement and he cannot understand why reference to it in the latter is required at all. Regarding (2) and (3) above Shaikh of Kuwait refused to reduce or compromise any of his demands and stated he had received Wednesday telegram from 100^&gt; British company asking permission open negotiations for concession. We understand telegram came from Baghdad and suspect B.O.D. Shaikh of Kuwait said would be ready sign our concession now if it contained his demands as already stated hit subject to his rights being admitted would defer action regarding appointment- director and chief local representative for 3 months from signature for further discussion with you. We do not know if additions reference to first above are essential but if they are consider Political Resident will have to arrange with Shaikh of Kuwait which is likely to mean considerable delay. Unless you can omit additions regarding Government agreement and agree Shaikh/V ■ 2 . Shaikh of Kuwait financial terms ref. to our telegram No.15 ana the bulk of textual alterations we suggest no further progress can be made here by us pending settlement by political authorities questions Government agreement and revisions of our text agreeable to Shaikh of Kuwait. In which case we might arrange with Shaikh of Kuwait postponement of our discussions 2 to 3 months while we return discuss with you. We see no other alternative at this stage except to agree Shaikn of Kuwait demands and conclude agreement now.

Point(a) of your telegram of 17th inst. No.962. , M) There is something to be said for Shaikh f s point of view* oince he has no objection to political Agreement in itself perhaps insertion words 'To which Agreement the Shaikh has no objection' after '1934' in both articles might modify his susceptibility. If you concur I suggest DICKSON approach Shaikh with this suggestion. 2. Shaikh has agreed point (b) since with regard to local representative all he wants is that 'some notice should be taken of his wishes'. 3. Your point (c). Shaikh presumably understands from DICKSON that he should consult us before opening any negotiations with outside companies. -RESIDENT-n Telegram I.F.0.1930. drom Political Agent, Kuwait. To Political Resident, Bushire. No. 162. Dated the 3rd May 1934. Kuwait Oil negotiators report that they have re ceived strongly worded letter from Shaikh dated 1st May to the effect that they have already been informed of Shaikh's minimum financial and other demands which they must consider as final. That they must obtain telegraphic instructions from their London principals as to whether his terms accept able or not as further delay useless. 2. I take serious view of letter and think Shaikh mey break off negotiations unless something is done by London quickly to relieve situation. 3. It seems clear now that Secretary of State for Indies telegram 962 greatly disturbed Shaikh who still further ir ritated by latest instructions re Neutral Zone delivered by me on April 28th as seeming to doubt his previous assurances. 4 . I suggest best way to restore situation now is for negotiators to be given entirely free hand to revise or omit offending clauses and settle all financial terms direct with the Shaikh. 5. Shaikh told me this morning that other Company was pressing to start negotiations.2 CQNFID l^TIAL. No#C~163, POLITIGAL AGENCY, KUWAIT• Dated the 3rd May 1934. From To 3ir, Lt.- Colonel H.H.P.'Uekson, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; The lion* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e . 2TP ll Kegot ia ti o| In contin’jation of my telegram No. 162 of 3rd May, I have the honour to enclose translation of Letter Co.aH/o/IB83, dated 17th C.uharram 1353 (1st May 1934} from H.S. the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Kuwait Oil Company. B. Messrs Holmes and Chisholm (the latter of whom was absent in Basra on 1st May) visited me on 2nd May, and reported the receipt of the above letter and also furnished me with a translation, .both appeared seriously coicerned at what they considered to be more or less ”an ultimatum”• 3. At a subsequent discussion which I had with the above two gentlemen, Major dolmes expressed the opinion that the Shaikh was being pressed i)bjrman outside quarter, and so had decided to force an early issue with the Kuwait Gil Company. He mentioned that he had inner information that the Shaikh had received two further telegrams frcm the strange company whom he suspected to be ohe B#O.D« This may or may not be true. 4. Major Holmes added ttiat what worried him at this stage most of all, was the new attitude of the Shaikh. The latter, he said, had always in the past been on the most intimate and friendly terms with himself (Major - olmes), but that quite recently he seemed to have changed entirely, and to be no longer desirous of trusting him or having uqr direct dealings with him. I ■ I- 2 - 5* Both Major Holmes end Mr,Chisholm ccmplained that their principals at Home appeared to have no conception of the difficult atmosphere out here in Kuwait and still less of the suspicious mental 'make up' of the Shaikh, and by their refusal to face facts were going out of their way to endanger the whole success of the negotiations. Thier latest request to be allwed to proceed to London and explain the seriousness of the situation out here, had been, they said, turned down. As far as one could gather from the talk of these two gentlemen, they appeared to feel that their hands were being unnecessarily tied by their directors at Home, who were not in touch with facts nor could keep pace with an ever changing situation. Phis of course was all said in confidence, 6, as I have already said in my telegram under refer- enee, X take a serious view of the Shaikh's letter and the situation generally, which seems to have taken a turn for the worse in the last week. In my opinion unless the Kuwait Oil Company walk very warily, I should not be sur prised if the Shaikh were to break off negotiations, 7 . I am pretty sure in my own mind now, that Mis Majesty's Government's message re Clauses 11 --(d) and 20 of the draft Commercial Agreement, which I was ordered to deliver had a most unfortunate effect of the Shaikh's mind. He became furiously suspicious, and from a subsequent con versation which I had with him he seems to have got it into his head that heis in process of being bullied by a com- bination of the Kuwait Oil Company in London and His r.ajesty Government, and he probably is determined in his own mind _ _ rrrurt 'hfOUblC IS 1118.1 W© not to submit to further pressure. The . t Ara p pride, and a false move are once again up agai Kuwait Shaikh decide to break with the Kuwait may easily cause the SbaiKn Oil Company for good. I have/? .TJI.AM 4 ^ A T I q |||?L .
