Since hie arrival here, Hickinbotham has been / consiiering ways and means of settling this longstanding dispute and thinks that he can arrive at some agreement satisfactory to both sides on the lines of the neutral zones between Kuwait Ira^i wncl aaudi Arabia. He tells me that the Kuwait neutral zone has worked very smoothly and that the fact that there is no unified administration in it appears to worry nobody. 1 presume that neither His Majesty's Government nor the Government of India can raise tiny objection to such a solution and am asking him to punue the matter on those lines. 3. With the drastic reduction in the cereal &lt;iuota and the gradual exhaustion of old stocks of rice the ability of the Trucial Coast and ^atar will be greatly diminished, but when one has rulers who are liuite prepared to starre their own subjects to make a few rupees one cannot hope for complete security. 1 am sending a copy of this letter with its enclosure to I eel and Hiokinbotham • 3d.3.G.PRIOR ►K.Caroe, libviuire, C.**«X.,C.I«i£., I • C.S.

I.Iy dear Sir Geoffrvy, Please refer to the enclosure to your printed letter No. C/512 dated the 12th of December 1943. 2. As soon as I had an opportunity I had a long conversation with His Highness on the subject of Zubara and the possibility of arriving at an agreement satisfactory to both sides on the lines of something similar to the neutral zones between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia and Iraq. I was pleased with the result of my talk with His Highness and was under the impression that he would be willing to accept a solution on the lines suggested. On my return from Raa^a I acquainted Belgrave with everything that had transpired at the meeting. I was extremely surprised two days later to learn from Belgrave that the Shaikh had entirely misunderstood the idea of the neutral zone. It seems he was under the impression that his sovereignty over Zubara and a belt of land some five miles deep enclosing that village would be acknowledged and a further belt of territory between the Zubara area and the domain of the Bin Thanis would form the neutral zone. 3. I am at a loss to understand how this misconception occurred for I am certain that nothing that I said could have led His Highness to believe that it was ever our intention to acknowledge s his sovereignty over the Zubara area. I do not believe that the Shaikh intentionally misled us or that having adopted the neutral zone idea he was later persuaded by interested persons to change his mind. I am of the opinion, and Belgrave agrees with me, that there was a definite misunderstanding. Anyway, I took an early opportunity of renewing my conversations with him and although we talked for several hours little progress appeared to have been made, but any misunderstanding which there might have been was removed. Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., /4. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.4. This morning His Highness called to see me ostensibly to enquire about my health but in fact to make a further contribution towards the solution of the Zubara problem. It is now possible that His Highness would agree to being granted personal possession of the old Al Khalifah buildings at Zubara itself including the cemetery and also personal possession of the dilapidated forts which ring the Zubara area. As regards the Zubara area access would be granted to everyone, i.e., Al Khalifah tribesmen, Bin Thani tribesmen, and Saudi Arabian tribesmen. The Shaikh would like to be in control of the area in the event of any disorder occurring between the various tribesmen. Pie would not adjudicate between the parties but would send them, assuming them to be Qatar subjects or persons subject to that Shaikh's jurisdiction, to Bin Thani to be dealt with according to the lav/ in force. He would naturally have full jurisdiction over his own tribesmen. The ground would not belong to him and he would have no rights therein which of course would mean that the oil agreement would not be affected by any solution of the Zubara problem on these lines. The whole thing is very nebulous and I now propose to endeavour to get His Highness to be rather more definite than he actually has been and to reduce his ideas to writing so that any further misunderstanding with regard to his exact intentions will be avoided. 5. This last move is an indication that His Highness is not averse to the settlement of the Zubara question and it is not in my opinion his last word. As soon as I am quite sure of my grounds in Bahrain I will go over to Qatar and see if Abdullah bin Thani has any suggestions to make with a view to the solution of the problem and possibly see what their reactions are to the Bahrain suggestions. As soon as I see a reasonable chance of the problem being solved with the agreement of the two Shaikhs I will communicate with you officially, and in the meantime I v/ill keep you fully informed of my unofficial conversations.No. 7 / - y S&gt; 0 f 13C3 Office of the Adviser to the G-overniiient, Bahrain Dated, Moharram 12, 1363 January 8 , 1944. /r H.

(After Conpliments) Since my return here T have been considering the question about which I came to see you. Bearing in mini that you are genuinely anxious to bring to an end the unfortunate state of affairs which has existed and still does exist between t atar and Bahrain and that you probably did hot have sufficient leisure when I was at Riyan to examine my suggestions dispassionately I am sending yon for your private information what I think would be a possible solution to the problem. T have not seen His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad since my return an shall probably not do so until I return from Dubai later in the month. I ask you to consider my personal suggestions very carefully bear irg in mind that nothing can be gained except by good-will. There must be give and take on both sides and a genuine desire to reach agreement. 2. It is unnecessary for me to stress the benefits which will accrue to your country by a settlement of this dispute nor do I deny for one moment that Bahrain will not benefit. It will be mutually beneficial and the difficulty and danger of supplying Qatar with grain and sugar from Dubai will be overcome. 3. I favour a meeting between Your. Excellency and His Highness Sir Shaikh Salman bin Hamad when agreement is reached on the lines mentioned to you at our meeting but I have so far made no mention of the N natter in Bahrain. Haji Mohamed bin Man a will shortly be visiting Bahrain I understand and if there are any small points of difference about my suggestions perhaps you would authorise him to discuss them with me. / 4 ~ —4.

I shall be grateful if you will remove this embargo and restore friendship and brotherhood between us and Al-Khalifah as it was in the past.

I suggest that this could best be done by Your Excellency writing rhe a letter expressing your desire for a restoration of good relations and brotherly friendship between Qatar and Bahrain and in that letter acknowledge the houses of the Al I dialifah as the ir houses just as Your Excellency might no doubt acknowledge the houses of the Al Mana as belonging to them.

Political Agency, Bahrain, 15th May 1944. / Vty dear Sir Geoffrey, \* Please refer to the correspondence ending with your demi-official letter N0.71-S dated the 24th of January addressed to Sir Olaf Caroe. 2. Negotiations have boon proceeding steadily since the middle of December 1943. I do not prooose to wenry you oven with a resume' of the arguments which have been used by tfco Shaikh of Bahrain, by the Shaikh of ootnr, and by myself during the many hours of discussion which have taken place since the inception cf this latost attempt to solve the Eubara problem. Pother X propose to inform you of the present position and very briefly how it has boon reached. 3. /.o you are avare negotiations wore started with the object of solving the Tubara problem by persuading the Dhaikh of Bahrain and the Shaikh of 'atar to agree to the Zubnra area being a 'neutral zone' on the lines of the 'neutral zone' bet ween Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The proposition appealed to the Shaikh of Bahrain but did not appeal to the Shaikh of Oatar who was not prepared to relinquish his sovereignty over any part of vhat he considered to be his dominions. I thon tried a different line and made certain personal suggestions to the Dhfiikh of Bahrain which were thoc the actual buildings at Zubera might be considered as the personal property of the A1 Khallfah and also the ruins of the forts in the noghbour- hood while the territory should remain as a part of the Shaikh- dor'. of do.tar but the area in tho immediate vicinity of Zubara should be open to ail cowers without let or hindrance. The Shaikh of Bahrain was to wake it clear that any eitfrciomont with The Hon'bio Sir Geoffrey Friar, K.C.l.D*, Political Hcsident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. /thea 2 . tho Shaikh of Qatar would not affoct tho ngroGmont botwoen Moasro. Potroloun QoncoMolona Llnilted and th/it Hulor. The Bomowhat co^llcatod quootion of adjudication in the Zubaro area wns to bo solved b;/ oach party having jurisdiction over hia own subjects and it was suggested that there might be a fixed annual quota for subjects of tho State of Bahrain rooident in 7.ubni*a vho desired to taposn. sugar, cloth, and cereals from Bahrain. Suffico it to cay that those cuggeotions worn onl^' partly acceptable to both aides though I regret to say that much time was wasted before this became apparent. 4. Eventually after many mere hours of vested effort in endeavouring to reach a formula acceptable to both parties it occurred to me that the fewer conditions in any agreement th. t might be drawn up the less likely there would bo of trouble being caused by breacheB of small rnd unimportant clauses. Therefore I suggested tc the Shaikh of Bahrain that it should suffice if ti e cihaikh of Qatar would be prepared to acknowledge the personal family rights of the Al Khalifah to their graveyard and their derelict and ruined buildings and should express a desire for a rctui'n tc conditions as they wore prior to the 1936 disturbances. I wrote to the Shaikh of ' atar on these lines but his reply was not encoura ging. Qo I decided to await the return from leave of Khan Bahadur Syed ’bdur Wazzak when I would make one last effort tc persuade him to bo what I considered reasonable. &lt;*t the end of Inst month the Khan Bahadur visited ^ntar and after a stay of throe days returned with the shaikh of / Qatar*s acquiescence in the suggestion that it would suffice if they returned to tho conditions as they v/ere prior to the rupture; but unfortunately the Shaikh inserted o clause restricting or in fact forbidding the repairing of the present buildings or tho conatruction of now buildings at Pubara or /sa sr-ul-Murair3 . 0Ger-iil-?4urair* Full of hopo Bolgr^v© and I tackled the Shaikh but he vns suspicious of the 'no building' clause; and so a second draft was made and a further letter vrne sent with a private letter from khan Bahadur Sped /bdur PazzAk to the shaikh of star's general factotun Saleh bin Klanah. I have now received the Shaikh of 'atar's reply, a copy of which I enclose* I have not yet had an opportunity of bringing it to the notice of the Shaikh of Bahrain but 1 propose to do so on the 16th of r4ay and I will let you know his reactions at the first possible opportunity* If they are favourable then I will Inform you officially of the position* If they are unsatisfactory then I will co/inuni- cate by mail and will probably suggest that we should advise 'haikh Salman off 1clolly to accept the Shaikh of ''star's suggestions• 6* I should make it quite clear that from the beginning v till now I have been at pains to make it clear to both Hulers such personal influence as I possess to endeavouring to help them themsolvcs to find a solution to a problem which has disturbed their peoples for the last seven years* The end of the 'Fubarn Ouostion* will bo welcomed moot heartily by ovoryono in both countries with the possible exceptions of the 'Thaikh of Bahrain and Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah the youngest son of the shaikh of ^atar* that at no time have I been acting officially.

My dear Sir Geoffrey, w /P 1 Please refer to my demi-official letter No.C/768 dated the 16th of May 1944. 2. Since writing my letter under reference I have had two hours discussion with His Highness and Bolgrave on the latest proposal from Oatar. His Highness pointed out with some justification that it differed materially from the draft which Khan Bahadur Abdur Hazzak had brought back from oatnr. I am therefore writing to the Khan Bahadur and asking him for his comments. 3. The next move in this rather unexciting game must depend on Khan Bahadur Abdur Hazzak’s reply but I think that I will make one last attempt to bring matters to a head by taking Abdur Pezzak with me to Qatar as soon as Rogers arrives here and very possibly a representative of His Highness. If such a combination fails to reduce the Bin Thani citadel then I will confess myself defeated and other and bettor means will have to be resorted to if this silly squabble is to be termi nated. Yours sincerely, Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.n., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushiro.D.O. No.C/775 Politico!

Just before leaving,! asked the Shaikh to confirm what he said to me which he did as above but added that the Oil Company were exempted from the condition under (b) above should it become necessary for them to have operations thete. io this i replied that it was a separate matter* 3* The above conditions were fully explained and discussed by me with H.H.Shaikh sir salman bin Hamad on the night of 2Sth April 1944. There was no end to H.H's non-logical arguments in spite of the long hours (i.e. from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m.) x spent with him. ni-om ny conversation with H.H. I discovered without doubt that H.H. was trying to exact in a vague and obscure fom an acknowledgement hich gives nim sovereignty right over an area which, according to I 1H.H.extend^ to 24 miles* in order to divert H.H* from this idea and suggest the answer, so that he may corait himself, i said to H*H* thdt i believed H*H* had no intention of making territorial claim but only to save the prestige of the Al Khalifa in the eye of the people. He replied in affirraative / whereupon I asked him to dictate the form of the agreement* Having comitted himself, h.H. could no t avoid accepting the suggestion made by shaikh Abdullah which saves the prestige of the al Khalifa. He tried however to make the form of the agreement as obscure as possible. He took it witn him and brought it in the morning to the Adviser f s office with rt slight addition which after discussion with you was subsequently altered, it was this draft which was dictated by H.H. that was for warded to the shaikh of Qatar, before sending it I said that I did not think the shaikh of Qatar ^ould agree to it, but we did so in order to see his reaction. ,b*rom the above it would appear that the Shaikh ot Qatar did not go back a^ what he said to me but wanted to make things clear in writing so that he may not have trouble again with bahrain, the fact which is in the interest of both parties. The Shaikh of Qatar admits in his letter that the wordings differ from what he said to me but that the meaning is the same# The draft agree ment by the shaikh of Qax,ar does not differ in essanae with the draft hy H.H.except that it makes things very clear and unob*cure. £1 though the shaikh of Qatar did not add in the agreement (c) and (d) above, I am sure he would not hesitate to add them when we ask him to do so. 4. yarding the addition about the oil kj* company. *h e shaikh granted oil concession to the company before the trouble started and, in accordance with his undertakings, he is bound to allow them to carry on their work in any part of his territory. Any agreement with a third party which restricts their operations in any area would be considered as void and not binding sin'e^o mttnrt effect on the Company»s operations. Therefore, l believe,that H.H. understands this , ; fully well and would not make objections. This being the case, i think that the chance of concluding a permanent peace between QaLar and Bahrain is now certain, it would be easier to discuss the matter with Shaikh Abdullah bin Ida and leave it to him to induce H.H. to agree- 3 - to a reasonable form before going to t^atar* 5* i am ready ai* your service whenever you want me and I @ am certain -uiat you would succeed in ending this trouble for which later both parties will/feel grateful to you* ¥ours Obediently. . &gt;r T*Hickinbotham,c.I.iii. , l^he political Agent, ’ BAHRAIN .:ONFIJ/SH?lAli Political Agency, Baliraixi| 30 th • *4ay 1944, My dear Belgrave, I have now received a letter^from the Residency Agent which makes the Shaikh of Qatar*s view quite clear. He is quite prepared to restore relations with Bahrain and to acknowledge the rights oi‘ the Al Kh&amp;lifah to onsr-nl-Murair and Zuharah but he is not prepared to allow any building to take place in these places. Further* he will dc very for the Al Khalifah to make use oi Qatar territory in the same way and for the same purposes as they did before relations became strained. This seems to me to be a very reasonable attitude and I feel that His Higlmess could accept the suggestion vv i thou w any loss of prestige to himself or his family, und with consi derable material gain. 2. I had some discussion with Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa the other day with regard to this suggestion and unTcretood that the now fort at Zubarah might be a rather difficult problem to solve. I explained to Shaikh Abdullah it was unreasonable to expect the Shaikh of Qatar to withdraw his g a rrison imme diately as it would not nr cate n good impression with his own tribesmen, it might be possible to arrange thnt the garrison bo withdrawn within n reasonable period* say three or four months. Shaikh Abdullah said that he appreciated this point and appeared to consider this solution to the problem to be a reasonable one. 2.

I discussed the draft which was enclosed in your letter ’’Personal” dated 30th Hay, 1944, with His Highness and Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa yesterday morning, I was unsuccessful in persuading His Highness to agree to it. His Highness considered the draft agreement very one sided as it contained no sort of admission to the claim of the Khalifah to ownership of the buildings at Zubara, it merely stated not that the two parties had ’’agreed” but that Shaikh Abdulla had ’’decided” that the buildings were to remain as before. He also criticised the wording from which it appeared that the concession that is being made by Shaikh Abdulla ’’from consideration and reverence to the Al Khalifah” is that necessary work for the oil company may be done in the disputed area. 2. His Highness feels that each time he modifies his claims, as an example by relinquishing all demands for control or authority, Shaikh Abdulla becomes more indisposed to give way in any direction. 3. His Highness had spent a long time during the previous day going over the Zubara files, not knowing of your last letter, and he arrived at the office with a draft agreement which he had himself prepared and wished me to show to you. I explained that your draft was a final attempt at reaching a settlement and that you were prepared to visit Q,atar in order to persuade- 2 - Shaikh Abdulla to agree to it and I told His Highness that if this was not acceptable you had no other course than to refer the matter to the Resident. 4. His Highness desired me to sand you his draft and when I drew his attention to the vagueness of the new building clause he said that he was prepared not to build if you, not Shaikh Abdulla, requested him not to build but he considered that Shaikh Abdulla by building a new fort a few hundred yards from Gala al llurair had upset any possible arrangement by which conditions at Zubara could revert to the original status quo. p C—u o td co Fr s* ^ O O' P I—' o P* c+ P C+ p- • s-e 5. His Highness said that he would much regret if the matter could not be settled through your mediation but the question of referring it to higher quarters was not in his hands. He reminded me that all along he had not wished to open up the dispute during the war but the subject had been introduced by you. I explained again the difficulty about shipping space and supplies for Qatar and he talked for some time about the possibility of postponing the settlement of the Zubara claim till after the war and making some arrangement for Qatar supplies to be offloaded from here, but a solution by a method which retained the restriction on Qatar subjects coming in and out of Bahrain was not discovered. His N# P o h CD • P W c+ • O UJ ii Highness was anxious that his private quarrel with Qatar should not cause difficulty in shipping matters which were of war time importance. Shaikh Abdulla was in agree ment with the views expressed by His Highness and was particularly disturbed about the existance of Shaikh Abdulla 1 ’s new fort. The garrison of the fort, I under stand, were in Bahrain recently and received gifts from His Highness. ^10th ^int 19-'4 • Ldy ^ear Card, On tho 7th I had a Ion*: conversation with His Ili'ihaeoB and explained to him that the draft a£roe:aoat which you had ferrardod to Lie would undoubtedly not be acceptable to the Shaikh of Qatar. His Highness himself suggested that Iks word should bo inserted nnd I wrote it on tho draft in his presence and he then read the particular sentence again and was completely satisfied. The rest of the conversation &gt;?as concerned with the desirability or otherwise of the A1 Khalifah repairing buildings both at the site of Zubarah town ar.fi at tho veils fringing the Zubnrah area. Just before tne termination of our conversation, sfain at His Highness' request, I added an additional sentence to the draft. 1 an enclosing the draft with the wncil inserts for your and His Highness* inspection.

Subject ZUB/F^H t7^ v 67/c iplc-.£ A £ A a I left Bahrain for Qatar in the evening of the 15th of June in the motor launch 'Ghazal' which was kindly lent to me by Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited and arrived at Doha on the morning of the 16th of June. Information being sent to the Shaikh of Qatar at Riyan he immediately came in to Doha and received me in the house of Abdullah bin Darwish one of the principal merchants of the place. The Shaikh of Qatar has a house of his own at Doha but it has not been inhabited for some years and it was for this reason that he made his temporary headquarters in a house belonging to a merchant. 2. During my first interview with the Shaikh at about 10 a.m. on the 16th I discussed with him various outstanding problems, in particular the endeavours which were being made to re-establish friendly relations between Bahrain and Qatar, the question of the children of the manumitted slave Faraj bin Hadi, and reports which had been received with regard to the smuggling of cereals, sugar, and piecegoods, from Qatar to Persia. I found the Shaikh inclined to be cooperative and it was not long before the misunder standings which had occurred over the question of the children of Faraj bin Hadi had been cleared up. A separate communication has been made to the Residency with regard to this case as also has a separate communication been made with regard to the question of reducing the piecegoods, sugar, and cereal quotas for the Qatar peninsula. Our conversation on the subject of Zubarah moved on the usual lines with much protesting that the Shaikh himself was most anxious , to restore relations and more protesting that the aggressors have always been the A1 Khalifah. I showed the Shaikh a letter which . • I had received from the Shaikh of Bahrain making certain new sugges tions for the solving of their various differences which was no better received than any of the previous ones had been. In fact it was not at all acceptable. We therefore deferred any further reference to this subject until later in the day when it was decided that I should go to Riyan, the Shaikh's headquarters, /beforei: 2 . v before the time for the evening meal and we would then have a full and free discussion of this difficult subject. Shaikh Hamad the second son and the heir-presumptive was not well and was unable to be present at any of the interviews which I had with the Shaikh himself. Shaikh Hamad has had trouble with his teeth for some time past and I was given to understand that he was seriously ill and had been living on a milk diet for the ■ last seven days. The Shaikh alluded to the unfortunate condition of his son and said that he would like him to come to Bahrain for treatment. I pointed out to the Shaikh that the most efficacious way of achieving his object would be for him, the Shaikh, to write a personal letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain who I felt would be it likely to give^reasonable consideration and Shaikh Abdullah said that he would do so, but I am happy to be able to record that up to the present no such communication has been made and Bahrain has been spared the difficulties of a visit in the immediate future of such a troublesome person as Shaikh Hamad. After conversing for the matter of an hour and a half the Shaikh said that he would prefer to return to Riyan, the day being Friday, for his prayers and that he looked forward to seeing me later in the afternoon. 3. At the Shaikh*s request I lunched with Abdullah bin Darwish who is now the right-hand man and co-partner with Shaikh Hamad in practically every underhand dealing of any magnitude which takes place in Qatar. He and his two brothers Jassim and Abdur Rahman are Qatar subjects by birth but are IWsians by origin and all three of them have been gifted with more than average intelligence. Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak who accompanied me from Bahrain and Saleh bin Mana the confidant* and man -of- affairs of the Shaikh of Qatar were present at lunch. After lunch I returned to the house of Saleh bin liana and there discusse with him and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak the wj^rs and means of settling the Zubarah question — a question of which I,like many dozens of others,was heartily sick and my only desire was to either achieve a formula immediately agreeable to both parties or to receive an answer sufficiently negative to make it clear3r to me that any further efforts on my part were pure waste of time. It was fortunate that Saleh bin Mana, who it should be stated is disliked by Shaikh Hamad, came out in quite a different way to what I had been led to expect and I found him most helpful during the whole of my visit. We decided that the only reason able chance of reaching a decision was to endeavour to get the Shaikh of Qfctar to approve a suggested agreement, a copy of which I enclose, which had been drafted personally by Shaikh Salman and sent to Qatar about the 26th of April immediately after Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak’s previous visit. It was felt that if by any chance the Shaikh of Qatar would be prepared to accept the draft as it stood the Shaikh of Bahrain would find some difficulty in refusing now to agree to what he himself had put forward only a few weeks before. Saleh bin Mana want imme diately to Riyan to discuss matters with the Shaikh and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and I retired to the launch for a brief rest. 4. At approximately 6-30 p.m. I left by car for Riyan accom panied by Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and Saleh bin Mana. On arrival we were courteously received by the Shaikh and conducted at considerable physical discomfort to the old man himself to the roof of his palace where after coffee had been formally drunk we proceeded to the business in hand. After much argument and the addition by me of a clause safeguarding the interests of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited which I considered to be necessary the Shaikh of Qatar to my surprise agreed to Shaikh Salman’s draft without the alteration of one word. Paper was produced and Saleh bin Mana was instructed to make a record in writing for the approval of the Shaikh. While he was doing this the Shaikh and I discussed various matters of minor importance with the exception of the recent smuggling incident on the southern frontier in the neighbourhood of Jebel Naksh which can never be described as being other than of major importance. I warned the Shaikh of Qatar as solemnly as I could that he should do everything in his power to prevent any such incidents occurring especially when members of his own family were involved,pointing out that ra4 he knew as well as I did the fluid position with regard to his southfcfn boundary and that it was indeed unwise to give Ibn Saud the slightest excuse for making any advance in that direction such as the establishment of police posts to prevent smuggling. The Shaikh of ^atar said that he fully agreed with everything that I said and that he would do his utmost to prevent any recurrence of such incidents in the future. ✓ The copy was completed of the draft agreement and at that moment the Shaikh stated quite correctly, for the call to prayer could be distinctly heard, that he wished to go and say the evening prayer. He left, but had gone scarcely two minutes when he sent for Saleh bin Mana. 5. The events now to be detailed did not come to light immediately but I have no doubt that they are correct. On Saleh bin Mana leaving the audience room he was instructed by the Shaikh of Qatar to go to Shaikh Hamad, show him the proposed agreement, and instruct him to affix the Shaikh of Qatar*s seal to the document. It is interesting to note that Shaikh Hamad should have succeeded in so far gaining control as to have the custody of that most precious of all t he Arab emblems of sove reignty the signet ring. It appears that Saleh bin Mana went to Shaikh Hamad who read the document through, flew into a temper, it must be remembered he had severe tooth-ache and has had for some days previously, said that his father had sold the country to the Al Khalifah, that he would have no hand in such a proceedini and would not affix the seal. Saleh bin liana having no alter native returned to the Shaikh of Qatar and told him what had occurred with the result that the old man was most upset, became Saleh bin Mana returned to Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and myself and stated briefly what had occurred. Naturally we were both disgusted and disappointed and when the Shaikh returned immediately prior to the evening meal I asked him whfirH the docu ment had been completed. He became incoherent and it was with difficulty that we made out that he had decided that he must make various changes in the form and words of the agreement. I querulous and tore the document into pieces which he cast from him, whether5 \ y* protested that he as the Shaikh of Qatar had niven his word, that it was impossible to do business when he changed his mind every half an hour, and that as far as I was concerned the matter was ended. We sat down to dinner, a dismal meal with our host cursing the servants, his son Shaikh Ali behaving more like an &gt; elderly ewe than ever, Saleh bin Mana and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak not eating at all, and myself trying to think of some fcay out of the impasse. No further mention was made that A evening of the subject but I decided to spend the night in ; / Saleh bin liana's house in Doha and to send Ihe launch round to 6. That evening I dealt with certain minor business recorded elsewhere and took coffee at the house of Mohammed Al Mana where I met one Marzook bin Shamlan a Kuwaiti who was undoubtedly in Qatar in connection with piecegoods. No mention was wade that night to Saleh bin Mana of the incident which had occurred at Riyan and silence was maintained the next morning tmtil he himself reopened the subject. We made it clear to him that we had no intention of reopening the subject ourselves but in case the Shaikh of Qatar had thought better of matters I was giving him a last opportunity by calling at Riyan on my way to Zubarah. At approxi mately half past eight on the morning of the 17th I left for Zubarah via Riyan. On our arrival at Riyan we were again most cordially received by the old Shaikh and after the interchange of compliments appropriate to the occasion one of those secret whispered conversations which are always a feature of such dis cussions took place between Saleh bin liana and our host the outcome of which waa that our host turned to me and said that he wanted to speak about the Zubarah agreement. We started all over again and eventually he agreed to the formula of the evening before with an exception $nd that exception was the deleting of the word This was moderately satisfactory although not as pleasant as had been the prospect of the night before, but I felt that the deletioi of that particular word might be considered as advantageous to at Zubarah to meet me there^/about mid-day on the 17th June. I informed the Shaikh that I proposed to return via Zubarah and / that I would call in the next day in the morning on my way to 1] Zubarah in order to say goodbye. /the6 7 / L &gt; the A1 Khalifah rather than the reverse and that it was possible that Shaikh Salman could be persuaded to accept• Once again the ceremony of copying was gone through, once again came the time for signature,and at the suggestion of Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak the Shaikh of Qatar signed the document in the presence of his son Ali, Saleh bin Mana, Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak, and myself. He then said to Shaikh Ali 'Take this paper, show it to Hamad, and tell him to seal it'. Shaikh Ali took the paper and there was some swift thinking. I turned to the Shaikh and said 'It is really unnecessary. Tour iilxcellency has signed which is better than any seal'. There was an immediate chorus from Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and Saleh bin Mana of approval and Shaikh Ali stood in the doorv/ay uncertain which way to go until to the relief of all of us the Shaikh of Qatar said ' It matters not ' and the document passed into my keeping. Just before I left I asked the Shaikh whether there was any chance of his 1 going back on what had now been agreed &amp;nd he assured me that there was no chance whatsoever. 7. We left Riyan at a quarter to ten dnd arrived at Zubarah at approximately l 01 clock to find the_launch waiting and four and a half hours later we were back here in Bahrain. It is worthy of record that although the return trip was most comfortable the outward trip to Doha was quite the reverse. The launch rolled in a really incredible manner to the music of breaking china and of moving furniture with, the result that with the exception of Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak, our pilot, and myself every person in the vessel including the crow were overcome by the movement which was certainly remarka bly unpleasant until we rounded Ras Rukn at 12-30 a.m. on the morning of June 16th. i 18th June 1944.TranBlatlon of .Oraft i A^&lt;»«un«nt.. i .e26th April 1944. ) Th« Ruler ot Bahrain and Ruler of Qatar agree to the restor ation of cordial relations between them as they were in the past* The Ruler of Qatar undertakes that zubara area should remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past| this being out of consideration and reverence to A1 Khallfah* Also the Ruler of Bahrain f on his part, undertakes not to do anything that might harm the interests of the Ruler of Qatar* «LAgr ee ment of Ju ne 17th 1944&gt; th% «ul«r of j*a&amp;rain and muIot of ^at»ar agree to the resto ration of friendly relatione between them as they were in the past.

According to the provisions of the agreement, the position was to be restored to what it was in the past. Aoout three months have now passed since the agreement was concluded and Shaikh Abdullah has not done anything to change what he h^d brought into existence, during our conversation on two occasions you promised me to have the position restored to what it was in the past. I acted in accordance with the agreement and you are aware of this as you have noticed it from me and .in my country(which remained)as it was in the past but he(Shaikh Abdullah bin dasim)had not done anything of this sort. It is, necessary therefore/ to remove what was brought into existence during the trouble and to return my arms which had been taken away from ny subjects.

I draw Your Highness 1 attention to the following phrase in the agreement 'The Ruler of Qatar undertakes that Zubara will remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past”, from which it does not appear that anything is required to be changed which existed at the time of the agreement but rather that there should be no new innovation. 4. During the conversations referred to in your letter under reference. Your Highness asked me personall^whether I would endeavour to have certain arms returned to you by the Shaikh of Qatar as ypu stated it was customary for such restitution to be made on the resumption of friendly relations by Arab tribes of importance. You desired, so you said,* a symbol from which the Al Khalifah would understand the extent to which both sides to the agreement were prepared to.go in order to ensure that their good intentions were plain to all men, At the same time, you drew my attention to the Port at Zubars which up to the present time is garrisoned by adherents of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim and gave it as your opinion that it would be difficult for the Al Khalifah to enter Qatar for their hunting expeditions * by way of Zubara when subject to the scrutiny of the ShaiPh of Qatar soldiers.

I made no promise other than to use my best endeavours to achieve this purpose. I still propose, when more important affairs permit me the time^ to pursue this object. After Your Highness’ very detailed exposition of the situation on the night of Friday the 15th September and my opcn statement of my views I am sure there can no longer be any room for i misunderstanding. I trust that the'pleasant relations which now exist between this country and the Shaikhdom of Qatar will contimx for more years than Your Highness or I 3-4ke- to contemplate and I feel sure that Your Highness will, as I will, use every endeavour to realise this objective and strengthen the bonds of friendship and good neighbourliness.

A.C. We regret to say that we find it abosutely necessary for the Zobarah question to be rewakened from‘its bed again. Since months passed we nave been thinking that it has been solved through you in a satisfactory way. When the discussions were started, we did not take the initiative, but only for the sake of your desire to solve the trouble for reasons connected with the food supplies for Qatar. The agreement was set which we accepted. The provisions of the agreement were set in the usual manner, but the important provision of this agreement was verbal. We therefore, in view of the conversations, find that the condition of Zobarah is restored to its natural condition (i.e. as it was before the trouble). The important matter which is making us grieved is the existence of the fort which was built by Shaikh Abdulla during the trouble and in which he kept an armed guard. This fort is overlooking Morair fort and is a few hundreds of yards far from it. If it has not been particularly mentioned in the agreement that Shaikh Abdulla should remove the fort and guard, we find it necessary for the condition to be restored as it was before and it is for him to remove this fort and guard, because as long as there is an Amir there ( a name given by Abdullah to the person leading t e guard) at Zobarah, it is not possible for any of our subjects to visit these places as it was in the past. You, in the discussions which took^place, confirmed that you will do your influence for removal of the guard and the fort. We shall therefore be grateful if you will fulfil what you have promised. But if you are unable to do that, we want to know if you have no objection to our taking up this question directly with Shaikh Abdulla. In the past as you are aware in accordance with the treaty with the Great British Government we take up matters concerning us with him direct. As a result of the agreement concluded between us and Shaikh Abdullah ! 4- 2 - /—\ we have become a laughing-stock in this Gulf, because it has become quite clear to everyone that Abdullah has made benefit from it, and we have benefitted nothing# We do not believe that you like to see us in a condition like this. We therefore, to s44isfy your desire, suggest to you to again put this matter into discussions. You will help to remove this fort and guard from Zobarah to enable us to visit this place without being subjected to the watch of Shaikh AbduMa^s guard at which time the world will clearly know that we have reached a satisfacotyr solution# But if Shaikh Abdullah insists for the existence of this fort and armed guard at Zobarah, we will prevent our suojects from making transactions or passage from Qatar and the condition will be restored as if it was before the conclusion of this agreement# U.E.CONFIDENTIAL No.C/1424. * Political Agaicy, Bahrain, 4th October 1044 From Major T. Hicktnbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E.. Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, , Camp Shiraz • ZoBAhA I have the honour to refer to my printed letter No.C/1380 • dated the 25th September 1944 and to enclose a copy of a letter cJuted the 3rd of October which I have received from His Highness the shaikh on the subject of Zubara and my interim reply thereto. 2. On the 26th of September I called on His Highness In con nection witn matters of general interest and he again raised the question of Zubara. He stated that his cousin Shaikh Khalifah bln Mohammed had just returned from a visit* to the mainland and found the guard at Zubara had been increased and that on his arrival at Zubara the Shaikh of Qatar's men came down to examine his launch. His Highness seemed much put out, and with cause, for an increase in the guard could certainly be construed as an i infringement of the agreement. I indicated that Shaikh Khalifah must have been misinformed and His Highness sent for him at once so that I could confirm his statement. Unfortunately he had left the palace precincts. On my return to the Agency I desired Shaikh Khalifah to call upon me which Jae did at once. Far from confirming His Highness* words he denied ever having said that the guard had been increased. He stated that he informed His Highness that the guard appeared to consist of only four men though there were said to be twelve, and that he and his party were greeted with the greatest civility. The men who came down to the beach did so to • enquire who they were and having discovered they were from the A1 Khalifah were very helpful and friendly.On two separate occasions His Highness has assured me that he would he perfectly satisfied If the guard is withdrawn from the fort and that he would not raise the question of the destruction oi the fort Itself* I understand that he made the same statement to the Adviser In the presence of Shaikh Ahdullah bln Isa* He has nov^ln his letter which form** an enclosu^ fort* X regret to say that in my opinion His Highness* w subject of which his mental equilibrium seems tc have been dis— in demanding the destruction of the fort at Zubara* The requsst ecus gesture on the Shaikh of Qatar*** part to accede to the Why anyone should wish to visit Zubera I have no idea for the place is arid, unlovely in the extreme, and scarce one stone of from whom there is the slightest hope of gain cen nd at half a hundred places on the Qatar coast without their eyes being offended by the sight of the guard at Zubara or of the fort Itself for that matter* 4* In my opinion there should bo no question of a return to conditions as they were prior to the conclusion of the agreement. Trade would be adversely affected, our recently concluded arrangements for the cons ^ryition of shipping apace by supplying Qatar through Bahrain rould have to be reconsidered, and the already critical labour position hero would not be improved by refusing entry to labourers from Qatar. It ia not as if public Is not to be depended upon In matters concerning Zubara, o; this communication, specificallv demanded the destruction 3* y However widely the agreement there can be no qi estion but that turbed. to have the guard removed is understandable for no one likes to be continually under observation, but while it would be a court- request his refusal to do so should surely not be considered sufficient grounds for an open breach between Bahrain and Qatar.' ufoo wish to hawk and the impecunious bedouin who fawn on anyone the old buildings remains upon ai other. Those of the family /opinio*' * £opinion was violently In favour of the upholding of the prestige oi the A1 Khalifah* HA public are in favour of the present state ol resumed liiendly relations and care more for their own pioiit ani convenience than for the honour of an unpopular Ruler anc his parasitical family. ihe time has come when His Highness should be iriicimed tUat xar from trying to pick a fresh quarrel v. n tie a ^ar he would be well advised to use his best endeavours to strengthen his relations with his neighbour for should an official decision ever be given on the Zubara question it would almost certainly be in favour of the Shaikh of Qatar. It may well b*e that His Highness looks forward to a day when the Bln Than! family are forced from their present position by their oppressed subjects and the A1 Khalifah are called upon to supply a new ruler for that unfortunate country. If this is so it is time His Highness was brought back to earth for though it is possible that the Bin Ihanis may lose their power in Qatay, their present iniquities are certainly trying their aibjects very high, there is no reason to suppose that the A1 Khalifah would ever be permitted to acquire territory on the mainland. 5. I had addressed a letter, a copy of which forms an enclo sure to this letter, to the Shaikh of Qatar on the subject of the withdrawal of the guard from the Zubara fort which however has not yet been despatched, and I had found the time and oppor tunity to discuss the question with His Excellency^ son Shaikh Hamad whose health has now much improved. 1 found Shaikh Hamad was not in favour of the guard being withdrawn though he could not put forward any convincing argument for its retention. Shaikh Hamad has assured me that he will not endeavour to influence his father one v/ay or the other and there would thus i be some hope of the Shaikh of Qatar agreeing without argument to the withdrawal of the guard. However, in view of His High ness' continued misstatements regarding what I had agreed to endeavour to do,I would prefer not to have anything further to do with this matter and shall retain the letter here pending your instructions on the proposal made in the following para- graphc p t. r *. &gt; • lT I 16. The agreement of the 22nd of December i860 precludes Ms Higjanesa from having any direct negotiations with any foreign State without tti e consent of Hie Majesty's Government, cna it is presumably to this agreement that His highness haa refenec. in his letter of the ?rd October* Separate nego* tiations were carried cn with our consent in 1957 between representatives of the Shaikh of Qatar and the representatives of the Shaikh of Bahrain and I see no particular reason why we should norefuse to permit the two Rulers to endeavour to settle their own differences* I therefore suggest that we should accede to His Highness* request to negotiate directly with the Shaikh of Qatar on the understanding that I am kept fully infoimed of the course of the negotiations and consulted before any decision is made. At the same time I consider that His Highness should be informed that the Shaikh of Qatar does not appear to have violated the agreement.of the 23rd of June, thrt a resumption of the blockade against Qatar cannot b e permitted, and that he would be well advised not to raise the question at all since a rebuff may well be the likely outcome. ^ M.ew ol the u' Mude which Hie j^g adopted I consider It desirable that a final reply to his letter of 3rd October be sent as early as possible and I shall therefore be .grateful if I may receive your instructions by telegram* I have the honour to be. Sir, * Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, Bahrain*CONFIDENTIAL D•0 # No•C/1425• My dear Sir Geoffrey, Please refer to my letter No.C/1424 dated 4th October. 2* I have little doubt that His Highness 1 letters of the 14th SepteLfoer and 3rd October will have caused you as much surprise as they did Belgrave and myself. The le tter of the 3rd of October seems so straneo after my letter cf the 23rd September * to His Highness that I think you should know how it came to be written. After receiving the first cf these le tters I made a verbal protest to His Highness who soemed surprised at my indig nation and declared that there was no question of my having 'promised” but only 'agreeing to endeavour' and that the letter must have been mistranslated. Ihis was of course absurd. I suggested that His Highness might like to alter the !fe tter to accord more with the facts and sent it to him the following day, but it was returned without amendment. Jassim bin Mohamed my most reliable interpreter, whom I had entrusted with this mission, complained that His Highness seemed to wilfully misunderstand his own language where Zubara was concerned. In view of His Highness* extraordinary attitude I felt that I had no option but to reply as I did in my letter of the 23rd September. 3. As soon as was practicable His Highness discussed the whole affair at the usual distressing length with Belgrave soon after the latter’s return^and giving him his personal file asked him to examine the position on Friday the 29th “September at Jidda to which place as you know Belgrave normally retreats on the weekly holiday. Belgrave did as he was requested and being well aware th&amp;t His Highness had on more than one occasion declared that he would be satisfied by the removal of the guard drafted the original i of the letter of October 3rd. Ihis draft reviewed the position and suggested intervention by myself for the removal of the guard fc’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., /only Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Shiraz.2 only to be followed, should I be unsuccessful, by direct negotiation between the two Rulers in the hope that they would be more fortunate, and ending with a reference to the possibility of relations being again broken off* I^ovever, the shaikh without further discussion with Belgrave and without even showing him the letter before despatch inserted his demand for the destruction of the fort into t*id original draft and made various other sit ©rations, thus turning what was a conciliatory and constructive Is tter into one whose tone, viewed in the light of the previous corres pondence, can only be described as offensive* Belgrave is not unnaturally very upset but is too loyal to his master to give free expression to his feelings. When I say that His Hi^mess is deranged on the subject of Zubara Belgrave always replies 'His father was exactly the same' that is the nearest he will go to agreeing to the mental instability of the Shaikh.

The ill feeling between these two states engendered by the events of 1937 had had a most unfortunate effect upon this part of the Gulf, and the fact that Qatar depended upon Debai for supplies greatly facilitated smuggling and rendered control of rationing difficult, if not impossible. I found that I could make little headway with Shaikh Salman during- my fleeting visits to Bahrain, and I had not found time to visit ^atar since my return from Cairo. I accordingly requested Major Ilickinbotham to bring all his resources to bear tc br'ng about a settlement as early as possible, though there seeraed little hope of success at the time. 3. The pact can hardly be described as explicit in translation, but the Arabic is clear and the undertaking is couched in terms which are readily comprehensible to the parties, and as it is satisfactory to them we need ask no more. I purposely waited until Shaikh Hamad, the son of the ruler of Qatar, had concluded his visit to Bahrain as this would be the first test of the agreement and I am glad to say that it proved equal to the strain and that his stay has proved successful in every way. 4. Major Hickinbotham deserves the highest praise for the ability with which he hds -conducted these negotiations, parleys which were, moreover, concluded under the most arduous conditions. The happy outcome, which is a tribute to his political skill and profound experience of the ..rab world, will greatly assist me in my duties, and I recommend that I may be permitted to convey tc him your thanks for the successful outcome of his labours. .

(Id) T.H. 20-11-44(Copy in translation) To Major T. Hlcklnbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain. ¥e, the uniersigned, beg to submit our complaint to you and to represent our case in particular, and that of the people of ^atar in general. Matters have come to a head and we have been reduced to a wretched state on account of the tyranny and evor increasing Oppression we are receiving at the hands of our Ruler , haikh Hamad. vffcat has made matters worse is his injustice in taking away what the High British Government has kindly granted in this h&lt;*rd time, namely, war time. All these years he has been Caking out of the sugar and rice (which used to be issued then) and out of the wheat and wheat flour. As regards sugar and piecegoods, ho and Abdullah bin Darwish agreed to make away with what should be given to the people. Ibn Darwish has detailed his boat cap tained by Nasir to ship sugar, piecegoods, and tea from Dubai to Charak and Maghoh. Two-thirds of what is brought to Qatar is shipped to Kuwait and Khorramshahr. This Shaikh and and his assistant Abdullah bin narwish have put us in this pitiable condition. We have, therefore, written you this letter requesting you to save this miserable nation as we are out of Qatar and enjoy your protection. We would add that had we been in Qatar we would not have been able to submit our grievance to you for fear of Imprisonment and oppression. We have left our country Qatar in search of a livelihood and to get rid of oppression as we h&amp;ve no one in Qatar to save us from the oppression of shaikh Hamad. pll (Thumb impressions of:-) Dated, 30th Thul Qada 1363. 16th November 1944.

Sir, ^' Zubara my printed Letter Ro. C/17B9^dated the I8th December ber 1944 ana to state that His Highness Sliallth Sir Salman bin Hamad A1 rChalifah, K.C.I.E., called on ma on December ’20th to acquaint me with the conversations which had taken place between the bearer of his letter, Abdullah bin Jabar, and the shaikh of Qatar. reception which had been accorded to his envoy, for such in fact Abdullah bin Jabar was, and much appreciated the terms in which the shaikh of Qatar had peered to himself and in particular to His Highness* father. The envoy was treated with great consideration and it would seem v r as able to discuss very frankly the outstanding problem betv/een the two States. to discuss the Zubara question as a whole with particular reference to the destruction of the fort there or, alter natively, the withdrawal of the guards from the fort. He was also instructed to discuss the possible return by the Shaikh of Qatar of all the arms wnich were captured from the , N*dm at the time of the Zubara disturbances in 1936. 3. Shaikh Abdullah, according go Kis Highoess, took the line that as regards the Zubara area he was not his /own 2 His Highness was obviously pleased with the I gather that His Highness authorised his envoy /v2• — 2 own master for he 7/as bound by the treaty negotiated by Sir Percy Cox in 1916« He staced that according to the treaty it r/as not possible for him, without the permission of His Majesty^ Government, to alienate any part of Qatar territory and therefore he could not acxnowledge the A1 Khalifah*s claim to Zubara. He is alleged however to have indicated to the envoy that ho would personally have no objection to acknowledging the rights of the Al Khalifah to the Zubara area if His Majesty»s Government would indicate that they would accord their consent to such a proceeding. The Shaikh of Qatar is stated to have described-the political agreements between His Majesty’s Government and Qatar at considerable length to the envoy and laid some stress on Sir Percy Cox’s letter dated the 3rd November 1916 by which we are precluded from appointing a political representative to Qatar without his consent. 4 . With regard to the withdrawal of the guar^** and the P9ssible destruction of the fort I was unable to obtain any very clear indication from His Highness of what the Shaikh of Qatar had actually stated but gathered he had indicated that it was^dnatter which _ie was unable to decide without direction from us. His Highness stated that his envoy had made it clear that the Shaikh of Qatar was prepared to act on an unofficial indication of our pleasure with regard to both those two points tuid would noc requira an official reemest. At this state of the conversation I decided that UJ'* it would as well be to accjuaint His Highness^uhe fact that I had already r ceived a verbal offer from the Shaikh of Qatar to withdraw ths guards which I lad passed on to you and that on your instructions I had informed the Shaikh’s messenger that there would be no objection to his suggestion and asked him to let me know for your information when the withdrawal had in fact taken place. 5. The last point which His Highnes raised and which3 \v^ Is of minor importaxico was Co do witxi the return of the which had been captured at the time of the original hostilities. The Shaikh of c^atar informed His Highness* representative that the arms were still in his possession and that they had been carefully preserved by him personally and that he was prepared to hand them over provided His Highness would make a definite written request for them. His Highness was inclined to seek our assistance in this matter but I point d out to him that it was a matter for the Shaikh of Qatar to decide and that porsumably if he desired him to return the arms and felt that he could ask for them he would do so. He fcould thus be able to put to x the test tne Shaikh of Qatar«s good intentions. His Highness made no definite statement with regard to his intentions and I am inclined to believe that h'. will have the intelligence not to push the matter any further. 6. If the shaikh of Bahrain*s envoy is to be believed the Shaikh of Qatar has undergone a very curious change of h art with regard to the Zubara question which can be explained in part by the fact that the real respect which the two Rulers have for each oth r hes been revived by the re-establishemnt of relations between their countries^ and in part f and I fear me th^ greater part, by the pressure which the Ruler of Qatar is at present being subjected to by us to improve the economic condition of his people. The existing agreement between the two countries restores the political position to what it was prior to the outbreak of hostilities in 1936 and is so worded as to obviate the necessity for a decision to be given with regard to the actual sovereignty of the Zubara area. If vnue coul &gt;e allowed to pass I think the old relationship between Bahrain and Qatar would be completely re-established and the z/uuara volcano would aguin return to the quiescent st-go, out only /wouldwould this be so if the Shaikh of ^afcar fulfils his of vdthdmwing * the guards from the fort of Zubara. intention ?• 'I find His Highness* account of the discussions in Qatar rather too satisfactory to be fully credible and I doubt not that the Bin Thanis would have a very different story to tell. What in fact has happened is that His Highness* very non-committal letter met with the reply it deserved, bland, polite, and equally non-commictai, and His Highness* verbal approaches have caused the Shaikh of Qatar to take refuge behind his treaty of 1916, what had taken place between Abdullah bin jabar and the shaikh of Qatar was undoubtedly to indicate thcit he felt that pressure might be brought to bear by us on the Shaikh of Qatar to obtain a declaration from him to the effect that he acknowledged the Al Khalifats rights in the Zubara area. par from acquiescing in what almost amounts to a request by His Highness I consider that his attention should be drawn to the fact that he was permitted to enter into direct negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar for v the sole purpose of arranging for the removal of the guards from the fort at Zubara, I ha^re communicated to you the substance of our conversation on the 18th of December and have been instructed by you to express your interest in what has already taken place and your hope that any future discussions will be confined to the specific question of the withdrawal of the guards from the Zubara fort. At the same time in order to ensure a continuance of the present reasonably good relations between the two countries I think that we should be well advised to do all that is possible to have the aforesaid guards removed, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, His Highness* object in so fully acquainting me with I suggest therefore that I should now inform him that Political Agent, BahrainTranslation of letter dated 28th Muharram 1364 (l3-rl-45) from H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahraih.

As you are aware we sent our man Abdulla bin Jabor to Doha, where he visited Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim and discussed with him. From the result of this discussion it appears that Shaikh Abdulla is not in a position to enable him to discuss this matter as he believes that any direct discussion between us and him will be against the terms of the treaty between him and the British Government which positively reuires him to avoid direct discussions with the Rulers of other countries. Therefore we shall be very grateful if you will inform Shaikh Abdull about the matHteff [lvU* you have informed us that you have not any objection to our discussing with him regarding this matter. Six months have passed on the agreement of Zobarah and the flow of corners from Qatar to Bahrain has been increasing. We seriously want this difference between us and the Shaikh of Qatar to be settled altogether, so that our subjects will be able to go to Zobarah as they were doing in the past, which is not possible as long as the guard of Shaikh abdulla dominate the Zobarah from the fort he built there.

No .170 ~F. of 1364 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 28thR/TiEni 1364 April 11, 1945. 0 His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memor andun. Zubara. About eight months ago, after prolonged nego- ciations, the Rulers of Bahrain and ^atar signed an Agree h was supposed to settle the Zubara dispute which began in 1937. The Agreement was loosely v/orded and provided opportunities for different interpretations of its meaning but the gist of it was that conditions at Zubara should revert to what they were before the dispute. After the Agreement was signed various complaints were made by Eis Highness Shaikh Sulman regarding the non compliance of the Shaikh of ^atar with the meaning of the Agreement as interpreted by Eis Highness Shaikh Sulman, particularly regarding a fort which had been built close to the Khalifah fort at Zubara. This matter has now been '^ allowed to drop as the Shaikh of Qatar withdrew his garrison from the fort leaving only a caretaker. Before the dispute some of the Khalifah family used to live most Of the year at Zubara and camels and flocks belonging to the Khalifah and to other people of Bahrain were sent to graze in the Zubara area during the Spring. Six weeks ago His Highness Shaikh Sulman decided, possibly to test the genuineness of the Agreement, to send some of his camels, sheep, goats and donkeys to/ graze atUnci • • • • • 2 Zubara as was the custom in the past. Be' so he consulted the Political Agent who advised him to take this step. He sent about 20 men, with their tents and families and a number of camels, sheep and donkeys. From very soon after their arrival in Qatar they sent back complaints that officials of the Shaikh of Qatar were troubling and interfering with them. Finally a messenger from these people.who got back with some difficulty to Bahrain, reported that they were being prevented from returning to Bahrain. On my suggestion His Highness Shaikh Sulman sent for four of the men who were brought to Bahrain yesterday by launch in order that their statements could be recorded. I have seen the men myself and I enclose a copy of their statements which were taken down by me. It appears to me from the statements, which I believe are true, that Shaikh Abdulla moved these Arabs from the Zubara area in order that they should camp in a place where the Agreement regarding Zubara would not be enforced. His Highness has asked me to request you to write to the Shaikh of ^atar asking him to desist from inter fering with His Highness*s subjects such interference being contrary to the terms of the Agreement according to which people from Bahrain are free to go to Zubara as they used to do before the dispute. |i. It l Adviser to the Government.ALI Bin HASSAN, Nairn!, born in Bahrain at Sakliir, About a month and a half ago or nearly 2 months I and others went to Zubara with camels, sheep, goats and donkeys, from Bahrain. Eis Highness gave us permission to go. We camped at Hilwan. A few days later one Earned bin 3aad Gahtani and four men came to our tents and told us to leave Hilwan or they would take down our tents. I said I will go to Shaikh Abdulla, he was out on the desert. I went to Shaikh Abdulla and said ,T Shaikh Sulman says .^atar and Bahrain are one and I can go and come freely”, he said 'you must not go to Bahrain without a pass from me and you must not go except from the port of Birr Loof nor may you land in ^atar except at that port.. If you bring rations you must pay customs, the dispute. Shaikh Abdulla also said we should not camp at the 4 wells in the Zubara area. We camped three hours walking distance from the Zubara shore. According to Shaikh Abdulla f s orders, the place was Shaikh Abdulla ordered us not to camp in the Zubara area. Shaikh Abdulla said we were subjects of Shaikh outside Zubara area. We went to Zubara by orders of Shaikh Sulman, we thought we would not be interfered with, now we are afraid. We will not take passes or pay in Eis Highness T s house, subject of Bahrain. 5$'. I knew that in the old days we never had to take passes or pay customs so I was unwilling to do this as Shaikh Sulman told me all was to be as before outside the Zubara area and we camped there because 2 /--3/— ■ - 2 - customs because we never did so but if nothing is done we cannot stay over there.

In the old days I used to spend my time between Bahrain and Subara. I went to Zubara about two months ago, some o^* us went ahead. Y/e camped on the shore at Zubara, Hamad bin Saad, Shaikh Abdulla's man came and ordered us to move. We camped at Om al Suwein (in Zubara area). When I arrived there I found three tents on the ground, the occupants, from Bahrain, had been told by Shaikh Abdulla's men that they would cut the ropes if they stayed. Hamad bin Saad, Shaikh Abdulla's man, ordered the rest of us, who were at Hi1wan, to strike camp, he ordered all of us to leave the Zubara area ana go to Al Bab (outside the Zubara area). We all camped at Al Bab. Shaikh Abdulla's man said 'Shaikh Abdulla's orders are that nobody may leave without permission from the post at Abu Dhuloof. The head of Shaikh Abdulla's post at Abu Dhuloof is Earned bin Salim al Mennai. Also we were told that any rations we brought from Bahrain must be taken to Abu Dhuloof. We all get our rations from Shaikh Sulman and even before the dispute when we were in 4 a ’t ar we our rations from the Shaikh of Bahrain. I and all the men who went to ^atar receive pay from Shaikh Sulman. As long as I can remember I and all of us have been fed by the Shaikhs of Bahrain as were our fathers before us.HEJAN BIN HAS3A1J, Naimi, born in Rafaa, subject of Bahrain. In the past I lived in Qatar at Zubara and spent the summers in Bahrain. I went to Zubara two months ago with the second lot of people from here. We landed at Zubara and camped there, Shaikh Abdulla’s men came and ordered us to move and to go to Om Shuwail. We moved camp and found the first party of our people camped there, they told us that Shaikh Abdulla’s man had come and ordered them to strike camp. Others had been moved on from Hilwan. About ten days later Shaikh Abdulla’s men came and ordered us to move to A1 Bab, outside the Zubara area. He gave us orders not to leave without permission and to pay customs on our rations, 5$. We could not get away till our master sent us a launch two days ago. BAYYASH BIN MISEAAL, Naimi, born at Sakhir, subject of Bahrain. When we camped at Om al Suwain, inside Zubara, Shaikh Abdulla’s men came to us and said either move or I cut your tent ropes. We were afraid and so we let down our tents.
