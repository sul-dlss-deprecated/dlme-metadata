R. 8 ir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet (Constantinople). Foreign Office, June 6 , 1914, 3T5 p.m. HAKKI PASHA lias given me unfavourable replies about (i) the additional clause concerning irrigation works which might affect navigation on Shatt-el-Arab, (ii) short feeder railways, (iii) Arabian lines south of latitude 31, and (iv) he has no satisfactory information about Mesopotamian oil question, though I have impressed upon him my earnest wish to conclude all negotiations by 1st July at the latest. As to (i) the Ottoman Government appear to admit that navigation shall not be interfered with on Shatt-el-Arab by irrigation works, and I have been given no reason to explain their reluctance to embody this admission in an agreement in the wording I have proposed to which I attach importance. The clause I have suggested can do no possible harm to Ottoman interests, as the Commission itself is to be an Ottoman institution. As to (ii) and (iii) I am a little surprised that His Majesty’s Government should meet with a refusal in regard to such a moderate request, when Turkey has given such extensive concessions for railways to French and German groups. The complaint has frequently been made by Turkey that British capital avoids that country as a field of investment; the present attitude of the Turkish Government, in refusing even an option for short feeders to an Ottoman company in which British subjects are interested, is perhaps the true answer to the above complaint. Our wish is to facilitate the economic development of Turkey, and to avoid the total exclusion of British enterprise from the regions where concessions have not yet been given to Hakki Pasha says that our requests are regarded at Constantinople as fresh conditions of our assent to the customs increase and monopolies ; this is a mis apprehension. Point (iv) has been a condition from the first. Point (i) we regard as essential to the harmonious and successful working of the Commission, and we have proposed it in the interests of Turkey as much as in those of international commerce. Point (ii) will be very important to the Navigation Company when irrigation is developed and the local traffic may become some substitute for the diversion of through traffic to the Bagdad Railway. I cannot understand why the Ottoman Government objects to giving the option desired. Point (iii), what we desire is a preferential option for British enterprise, as against foreign, on equal terms. others.

Mallet (Constantinople), (No. 245.) R. Foreign Office, May 31, 1914, 12 - 25 p.m. I AM very desirous of getting all agreements with Turkey signed as soon as possible, and ratified before the end of June. There are, however, certain outstanding points in regard to which Hakki Pasha’s instructions are either indefinite or unsatisfactory. 1. The Mesopotamian oil concession. I cannot ultimately agree to customs increase (see my note of 29th July, 1913, to /Turkish Ambassador) or to monopolies until this question has been settled. What is the cause of delay ? 2 . Turkish Government have declined to agree to addition to article providing that irrigation works shall be put up to open competition. I am telegraphing text of proposed additional clause in a separate telegram. It is necessary that a provision of this nature should be made, as there is a close connection between the irrigation of the date groves and the conservancy of the river, and if the Commission, which it should not be overlooked will be Ottoman and not British, is deprived of control of irrigation in so far as it depends upon water from the Shatt-el-Arab, the river may become silted up and the whole basis of the present agreements with Turkey and Germany endangered. Perhaps the Ottoman Government do not fully appreciate the physical conditions, or realise that the mud and water from the Karun is forced by the tides up to Kurna, fertilising on the one hand the date groves, but on the other hand forming islands in the river channel. We do not wish the present irrigation to be interfered with, but the requirements of navigation must take precedence on the river. Your Excellency should urge Ottoman Government to reconsider their decision. 3 . Local lines to serve as feeders for river navigation and lines south of latitude 31. I hope Ottoman Government will send a conciliatory reply to my request to Hakki Pasha. I attach great importance to both points. r ~t&gt;—&gt; ! 21 40 ! 1LJ4 , \ ('600 —32][This Document is the Property:of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] r ? &gt; TURKEY.

His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will join in using their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to secure that the Shatt-el-Arab shall so far as practicable be brought into and permanently kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy in order that sea-going vessels may always be assured of free and easy access to the port of Basra, and to secure, further, that the navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab shall per manently be kept open for sea-going vessels, and be carried on under conditions of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations, without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or to their cargoes. Dues shall be imposed, not for the mere fact of navigation, but only for administrative charges of the Commission referred to in Article 7 and for repaying sums actually spent on improve ments in the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and harbour facilities. They shall in no case exceed 1 fr. per registered ton (the dues to cover the coming in and going out of the same vessel) except by agreement between the two Govern ments; any dues shall be levied on a basis of absolute equality without regard to the nationality of sea-going vessels or their cargoes. Article 7. (a.) The Imperial German Government having taken note of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, under which the free navi gation of the Shatt-el-Arab is assured on terms of absolute equality to the shipping of all nations and a commission is established for the execution of such works as may be necessary for the im provement of its channel and for its maintenance and for other like purposes set out therein, and being of opinion that the provisions of the said Convention are conducive to the best interests of international commerce, will uphold it so long as it is not materially altered and so long as the3 duties imposed upon the Commission thereunder are satisfactorily carried out. The Imperial German Government take note in this connection of the declaration, signed on the 21st October, 1913, and attached to the said Convention, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 thereof do not affect the rights enjoyed in the Ottoman Empire by the nationals of the Treaty Powers.

GREY presents his compliments to the German Ambassador, and has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of his Excellency’s note of the 9th instant, on the subject of irrigation works in Asiatic Turkey, and cognate matteis. His Majesty’s Government are prepared, as the German Government desire, to record the agreement about irrigation in an exchange of notes, instead of in the Anglo-German convention respecting the Bagdad Railway. The text of two notes, as tentatively drafted with Herr von Kuhlmann, is annexed to the enclosed draft of the Anglo-German convention.- It will be observed that the stipulation as to the principle of open competition is extended so as to cover the whole of Asiatic Turkey as distinct from Mesopotamia, and it is provided that the German Government should furnish to His His Maiesty’s Government an authentic list, giving the area and scope ol German irrigation works on the plain of Adana. His Majesty s Government would be g ad i the German Government would agree to these changes. , . , A saving clause has also been inserted in regard to canals connected with the Shatt-el-Arab. In view of the importance of keeping the river open for navigation, His Majesty’s Government must necessarily regard conservancy as taking precedence over im g ation^ ^ noted with muc h satisfaction that the German Government renounce their demand for the insertion of the article which was formerly No. 7 in the draft Anglo-German convention. In the unlikely even of Basra becoming inaccessible to sea-going vessels, His Majesty's Government would be fully prepared to discuss such a development with the German Government with a view to taking such latest.

If the “ English” Company shall not exercise its option the Ottoman Government shall be at liberty to call upon the “ English ” Company to i effect a junction at Afiun Karahissar and, if the “ English ” Company shall he ^ unwilling to do so, the Ottoman Government shall be at liberty itself to build the line and thereby effect a junction between the lines of the “ English ” Company and the [ lines of the “ German ” Companies.

Foreign Office, Your Excellency, June , 1914. On signing the Anglo-German Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c., I have the honour to state, with reference to article 1, clause (a), that His Majesty’s Government will not oppose the Bagdad Railway Company in securing the requisite fresh guarantees (i) to compensate the Company for the revenues which had been allocated for the purposes of the Rail way, but, owing to the Balkan war, may no longer be available for that purpose, and (ii) to enable the Company to complete the line. This assurance is subject to the proviso that His Majesty’s Government retain such freedom of action as will permit the British Delegates at the Financial Commission at Paris to criticise the details of any scheme which may be put forward in regard to the allocation of specific revenues. In default of some such reservation, the German Government will readily appreciate that the position of the British Delegates at Paris might be rendered difficult in the complicated questions likely to come up for discussion.

The Imperial Government expressly desire that this note should remain secret, and should not be published without their consent. No. 3. Draft of Note from Sir E.

Your Excellency, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government will use their good offices with the Ottoman Government, with the view of securing that the principle of open competition shall be upheld in regard to contracts or concessions for future vrorks of irrigation in Asiatic Turkey. His Majesty’s Government will not oppose a minor German participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to British subjects, provided that such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding the said contracts or concessions. In agreeing to this arrangement, I desire to bring to your Excellency’s knowledge the following clause in an agreement concluded between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government, which should in no way be prejudiced by the terms of this note :— “ En taut qu’il s’agit de travaux d’irrigation a executer par le moyen de canaux se raccordant directement au Chatt-el-Arabe, il est toutefois entendu qu’ils ne seront pas autorises par le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman sans avoir regu I’approbation prealable de la Commission fluviale. Celle-ci aura le droit de surveiller les travaux dont il est question pour qu’ils soient executes conformement aux plans et devis autorises.”17 I liave to add that His Majesty’s Government will raise no objection to the irrigation of the plain of Adana (for which, by virtue of existing agreements with the Ottoman Government, German subjects have already carried out considerable preliminary work) being definitely conceded to German subjects, and that they will not support any claims which may be advanced by British subjects to compete in regard to this enterprise. I understand that the German Government will furnish to His Majesty’s Govern ment an authentic list, indicating accurately the area and scope of the works in question. Xo. 4.

The Imperial Government will not oppose a minor British participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to German subjects, provided that such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding the said contracts or concessions. In agreeing to this arrangement, the Imperial Government take note of the clause quoted in your Excellency’s note of this date respecting canals connected with the Shatt-el-Arab, and agree that it shall in no way be prejudiced by the present arrangement. I have to add that the Imperial Government will raise no objection to those irrigation works in Mesopotamia, for -which only British firms tendered on the 20th April, 1912, being definitely handed over to British subjects, and that they -will not support any claims which may be advanced by British subjects to compete in regard to this enterprise.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant respecting irrigation works in Turkey. Sir E. Grey understands that the Board of Trade do not desire that the principle of open competition in regard to such works should he expressly extended to the whole of Asiatic Turkey, as distinct from Mesopotamia, in the Anglo-Turkish Convention, but that the British and German Governments should, if the German Government agree, bind themselves to favour the application of that principle to ihe larger area. This point will be discussed with Herr von Kiihlmann. As regards the negotiations with Turkey, Mr Parker discussed the subject of irrigation works below Kurna with Hakki Pasha on the 22nd instant. The utmost which his Highness would agree to recommend to his Government, ad referendum, was that article 5 of the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which is as follows:— “ Le Gouvernement Imperial ottoman invitera, publiquement et impartialement, des soumissions pour les entreprises d’irrigation en Mesopotamie qui ne rentrent pas dans la categorie des travaux qui font Tobjet de I’article suivant. L’executiou desdites entreprises sera accordee au soumissionnaire qui aura fait la proposition la plus avantageuse au Gouvernement Imperial ottoman” should be amplified by the addition of the following clause :— “ En tant qu’il s’agit de travaux d’irrigation a executer par le moyen de canaux se raccordant directement au Chatt-el-Arabe, il est, toutefois, entendu qu’ils ne seront pas autorises par le Gouvernement Imperial ottoman sans avoir regu 1 approbation prealable de la Commission fiuviale. Celle-ci aura le droit de surveiller les travaux dont il est question pour qu’ils soient executes conformement aux plans et devis autorises.” A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office, but Sir E. Grey understands that that Department is not likely to raise any objection to this wording. I am to enquire whether the Board of Trade consider that it may be accepted, and to ask that a rt ply may, if possible, be furnished before the 27th instant. I am, &amp;c. RALPH PAGET.

IN my note of the 25th March (7th April) I had the honour to communicate to vour Excellency copies of two articles, Nos. 6 and 7, which are to be embodied in the Anglo-German * convention respecting the Shatt-el-Arab, the Bagdad Railway, and cognate matters, of which the text is as follows . “ Article 6. “ His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will join in using their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to secure that the Shatt-el-Arab shall, so far as practicable, be brought into and permanently kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy, in order that sea-going \ essels may always be assured of free and easy access to the port of Basia, and to secure, furthei, that the navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab shall permanently be kept open for sea-going vessels and be carried on under conditions of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations, without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or to their cargoes. “Dues shall be imposed, not for the mere fact of navigation, but only for administrative charges of the Commission, referred to in article /, and foi repaying sums actually spent on improvements in the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and harbour facilities. They shall in no case exceed 1 fr. per registered ton (the dues to cover the coming in and going out of the same vessel), except by agreement between the two Governments ; any dues shall be levied on a basis of absolute equality, without regard to the nationality of sea-going vessels or their cargoes. “ Article 7. “ (a.) The Imperial German Government, having taken note of the Anglo-Turkisb convention of the 29th July, 1913, under which the free navigation of the Shatt-el- Arab is assured on terms of absolute equality to the shipping of all nations, and a Commission is established for the execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of its channel, and for its maintenance, and for other like purposes set out therein, and being of opinion that the provisions of the said convention are conducive to the best interests of international commerce, will uphold it so long as it is not materially altered, and so long as the duties imposed upon the Commission there under are satisfactorily carried out. . J “ The Imperial German Government take note in this connection of the declaration, signed on the 21st October, 1913, and attached to the said convention, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 thereof do not affect the rights enjoyed in the Ottoman Empire by the nationals of the treaty Powers. “(h.) His Britannic Majesty’s Government, so far as they are concerned, agree— “ 1. That the German consul at Basra shall have the right to correspond with the Commission on matters within its competence; “ 2. That, if in any case the Commission Jfail to meet the reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river, and refuse to remove the causes of complaint raised hy the German consul, the question at issue shall be referred to an impartial expert, to be nominated by agreement between the two members of the Commission and the German consul, provided that, if a similar or analogous complaint is made by any other consul, he shall participate in the said nomination, and that, failing unanimous agreement, Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands shall be invited to designate the expert referee. “ The Government of His Britannic Majesty will use their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to ensure that effect is duly given to such recom mendations as may be made by the expert referee.” To be put in the explanatory note :— “ In regard to article 7, clause (6), of the Anglo-German convention of the , it is agreed as follows :— I he expert referee shall, unless it be otherwise agreed by the parties concerned,proceed to ]&gt;asra for tke purpose of his enquiry. He shall publish his report within four months after having received all the necessary materials from all the parties, including both commissioners, or within four months of his arrival at Basra. ^ “ The expenses of the enquiry, including the remuneration of the referee, shall be jorne in equal shares by the Governments concerned.” In a further note of the same date I had the honour of informing your Excellency that, in regard to the above-mentioned articles, it was proposed to include in an explanatory note the following passage :— “ In regard to articles 6 and 7 of the said convention, it is agreed that the following recommendations shall serve as a basis for the work of the Commission “1. The Commission to set to work as soon as possible. “ 2. I he Commission to undertake a preliminary survey during a period of at least twelve months before recommending any large expenditure on permanent works. “ 3. The Commission to aim, as a first step, at a depth of 24 feet at high-water springs on the bar. “ 4.

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th May transmitting copy of a note from the German Ambassador on the subject of irrigation works in Mesopotamia and elsewhere in Asiatic Turkey, together with copy of a letter to the India Office, and to offer the following observations thereon :— The Board observe that, whereas the original proposal made by Herr von Kuhlmann on the 21st April was that the principle of open competition should be established for irrigation works in Asiatic Turkey generally (with certain exceptions in respect of Mesopotamia and Asia Minor), the proposal now made relates solely to Mesopotamia. The Board are not aware of the reasons which have led the German Government thus to modify the scope of the proposed agreement, but I am to suggest, for Sir E. Grey s consideration, that an effort should be made to obtain a reversion to the original proposal. Subject to this amendment, the Board see no objection to the proposed exchanges of notes, but I am to suggest that the wording of the first paragraph of the respecting exceptions to the general principle of open competition should be amended so as to read :— “ The Imperial German Government will raise no opposition to those irrigation works in Mesopotamia which were put up to^ open competition in April 1912, and in respect of which only British firms made detailed offers, being entrusted by the Forte to the English contractors, nor will they support any competitive efforts of German nationals.” Further, the stipulation in the second authentic list of the Mesopotamian works in Government should be made reciprocal an( ion in the second paragraph of the same note as to an works in question being furnished to the German being furnished with an authentic list of nationals under the third paragraph. lade reciprocal and provide for His Majesty’s Government authentic list of the works at Adana, claimed for German As regards the proposal, referred to in ^referred to in your letter of the 14th May to the India r to the Commission would, the If such an arrangement could be secured an extended to Asiatic Turkey generally, the Board are be unnecessarv, and probably inadvisable, to attemj works below Kurna from the general principle of o; stage might give rise to difficult questions and to Anglo-German Agreement.

It will he observed however that * t the Adana works would not in any case fall within the provisions of the agreement relating to open competition in Mesopotamia. Sir E.Grey would he glad to he furnished with the views of the Marquess of Crewe in regard to these pro posals; and I am to make the following observations for His Lordship*s consideration: 1. The principle of open competition is, unaer the German draft, now confined to Mesopotamia; in view of this limitation. Sir E.Grey considers that His Majesty's Government would he justified, either in the treaty itself or in the proposed exchange of notes dealing with exceptions to the general principle, in stipulating that below Kuma, (where irrigation, though restricted in extent and unlikely to involve any large contracts,(21069/14). contracts, has close connection with the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab) the Shatt-el-Arab Commission shall have complete freedom of action in regard to any irri gation works which may he undertaken. This contention might further he supported hy the consideration that His Majesty’s Government have indirectly and in a mea sure become responsible for the improvement of the 2. The principle of open competition is not al together free from objection in certain respects, but on the whole it seems less objectionable than any other arrangement which can be secured by treaty; one danger is that tenders may be made by unscrupulous contractors at an unremunerative figure, in the hopes of a bat se quent modification of the conditions when the work is in hand; another is that, owing to rebates which axe given, according to the Commercial Attache to His Majesty's Embassy at Berlin, on all German Railways to exporters of iron and building materials, German con tractors might have an undue advantage in competioiun, these rebates are not apparent as such, cut they are channel of the Shatt-el-Arab; granted(21069/14). granted in fact dy means of a lev/ through rate being charged on the goods in question to the point of des tination, and this is rendered possible by no charge whatever being made in respect of transport on German railways; a further danger is that, for political reasons, German contractors, like Herr Wonckhaus in regard to his operations on the River Karun, may be enabled, by veiled assistance, to compete on unremunera ti ve terms. The Board of Trade is Doing consuloed on these points, and possibly some suggestion may be made for an alteration of the wording, so as to secure that the contracts shall not only be put up to open render, but that the prices must be such as to affox'd reasonaole commercial remuneration. The second paragraph oi Prince Lichnowsky*s note, enclosed herewith, would perhaps affoi'd an opening for some such stipulation. Sir E.Grey is disposed to accede to the German de- sire to record the agreement about irrigation in a special exchange of notes provided they do not remain secret and are published simultaneously with the Auglo- He would have preferred to embody German Convention.(21069/14). the agreement reached in the Convention, as 'being the simpler course, hut he does not consider this question to he of primary importance. He proposes, however, to insist upon the article already drafted, in regard to the special works in Mesopotamia tendered for in 1212, being inserted in the Anglo-Turkish Convention itself, for he is not willing that it should he modified or suppressed on account of the German attitude. I am to suggest that it might he advantageous, with a view to reaching an early decision, if your Department were to enter into direct communication witn the BouaG. of Trade, to whom a copy of this letter has been sent, on the subjects referred to above. Sir E.Grey notes with satisfaction that the German Government have agreed to abandon the article (No.7 in one of the German counter-drafts) in regard to the con tingency of the Shatt-el-Arab becoming inaccessiule to ocean-going steamers.

IN accordance with my instructions, I have the honour to make the following communication to your Excellency with regard to the question of the allocation of irrigation works in Mesopotamia :— The Imperial Government attach the utmost importance, with the view of avoiding future misunderstandings, to the maintenance of the principle of open competition for the irrigation works in Mesopotamia, and they would at the same time welcome the creation of conditions tending to prevent too keen a competition which might conceivably entail undesirable consequences upon general relations. The Imperial Government therefore propose the following wording for the settlement of the above- mentioned question:— “ His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will join in using their good offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to secure that the principle of open competition in regard to contracts or concessions for the execution of future works of irrigation in Mesopotamia shall be upheld. “The Imperial German Government declare that they will not oppose a minor British participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to German subjects, provided such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding such contracts or concessions. .... • ^ “ His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not oppose a mmo German participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to Britis subjects, provided that such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding such contracts or concessions.

JL (XC# LICHNOWSKY.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] TURKEY. [April 22.) CONFIDENTIAL. ( \ Section 5. [17854] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. HERR VON KUEHLMANN spoke to Sir E. Crowe and me about irrigation works in Mesopotamia on Saturday. He said the German Government objected to the British claim that the sections tendered for by British firms alone in 1912 should now be reserved to British firms, and considered that the principle of open com petition should apply to all works of irrigation. It was pointed out to Herr von Kuehlmann that the Germans had acquired exclusive irrigation contracts in certain districts around Konia, and all we asked now was that British firms should not lose what we regarded practically as a droit acquis in Mesopotamia, for the said firms had alone tendered in 1912, and their tenders had only not been accepted because it was incon* venient at that time for the Ottoman Government to embark upon such expenditure. He then urged that if the British firms did not get the definite contracts all they could claim would be compensation for their out of pocket expenses in tendering in' 1912 : to this we pointed out that the British firms had expended brains as well as money in 1912, and we saw no reason why out siders should reap the benefit of either to their detriment. Moreover, the sections tendered for in 1912 were of relatively small extent, and only formed about one-third of the ^ illcocks scheme, which did not by any means extend to all the regions capable of irrigation. His Majesty s Government regarded the British claims to carry out the sections tendered for in 1912 as strong, and they must be upheld. As for the rest of the work, His Majesty’s Government had themselves pro posed to Turkey, who had agreed, that the principle of open competition should apply. Herr von Kuehlmann then said that he must get something, for his Government were rather put out about the German cable question, and he thought if he did get something, even though purely formal, it would strengthen his hands m inducing the German Government to abandon the article we objected to about a railway to the sorth of Basra : we pointed out that in any case [2098 y—5]\2 that article was of recent birth, and did not entitle the Germans to any quid pro quo if they gave it np in fact it seemed to be objectionable from their own point of view as well as from ours. He persisted that no harm would be done if we said that German firms might have a minor par ticipation in any contracts or concessions for irrigation we might obtain in Mesopotamia, provided the arrangement were mutual. To this Sir E. Crowe replied that the matter would be considered in consultation with the Board of Trade, but it would be necessary in any case to stipulate that such participation would only be admissible if it Avere considered commercially desirable by the firms concerned, and that His Majesty’s Government could only undertake “not to oppose ” it. When Herr von Kuehlmann came to see me on the 21st instant we drew up the annexed article, which I said I would submit to the Board of Trade, in order that they might consider it in consultation with the British firms principally concerned. I Avould draw attention to the refer ence in clause (b) to the German works of irriga tion in Asia Minor, and to the first paragraph of clause (a) which extends the principle of open competition to the whole of Asiatic Turkey. The Board of Trade are being consulted. A. R April 22, 1914.1/C' loS ) Annex. Article (a.) The Imperial German Government and His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare, so far as concerns themselves, that they will uphold the principle of open competition in regard to contracts or concessions for the execution of future works of irrigation in Asiatic Turkey. The Imperial German Government declare that they will not oppose a minor British participation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to German subjects, provided such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding such contracts or con cessions. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not oppose a minor German partici pation in any contracts or concessions which may be allotted to British subjects, provided such participation is deemed commercially desirable by the parties holding such contracts or concessions.

It is expressly agreed that the foregoing clause shall not be held to apply to those irrigation works already entrusted to German subjects in Asia Minor, or to those tendered for in Mesopotamia by British firms in 1912.Draft F.O. Sir, /S /^(Lj, I am directed by the S. of S. for I to acknov/ledge the receipt of your letter No. 19490 of 9th instant regarding the execution of works on the Shat-el»Arab. The ~arquess of Crewe is of opinion that as far as possible the whole country between Bagdad and the Persian G-ulf should be secured for British enterprise, and the nearer any district lies to the Gulf the more important is it that British enterprise should be seen to be pre dominant therein. Pe would there fore strongly prefer whatever arrange ment is most likely to obtain con- tracts for works on the Shat-el-Arab for Britis&gt; firms. Whether this can best be effected by open competition or by relying on the influence of the ;British member of the Riverain Commission is a matter for consider- ation; but as regards the former the danger must be borne in mind that German firms may, for political pur poses, be encouraged by their Govern ment to tender at rates with which competition on a strictly commercial basis may be impossible. As regards the connexion of con servancy with irrigation works, T 'is Lordship understands that the date proves below Kurna are mainly fertil-(sd)T.I.iioltae&amp;s, fertilised by water which is forced up the river by the incoming tide, and it . y ^ / fcc. JAa/'. M appears to him that v;orks^ would more naturally be regarded as part of the conservancy of the river rather than. ^ rsfly. Moreover, in view of the importance to British interests of keepitig the river open for navigation His i.ajesty’s Government must necessarily regard conservancy as taking precedence over irrigation. His Lordship would therefore ask whether it is possible to provide that the new article^ relating to irrigation should not apply south of Kurna, and that between Kurna and the Gulf all works on the river, whether for irrigation or conservancy, should be placed under the control of the Riverain Commission. His Lordship is consulting the Government of India regarding the salaries and personnel of the Riverain Commission, and will address you further on receipt of their reply.In any further communication on the subject, please quote No. 19490/14. and address— The Under-Secretary of State.

In a further note of the same date 1 had the honour of informing your Excellency that in regard to the above- mentioned articles it was proposed to include an explanatory note of the following passage (here follow last seven paragraphs of your despatch No. 133). “ The reply which your Excellency was good enough to address to me on loth April wms to the effect that the Imperial Government, having examined articles 6 and 7 of the proposed Anglo-German Convention as well as the points to be included in the explanatory note to be attached to these articles, were prepared to adhere to this arrangement. “ I am accordingly now authorised to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government agree to regard the provisions of the aforesaid articles as well as the six points comprised in the explanatory note above referred to as having binding force between His Majesty’s Government and the Imperial Government.” St. Petershurgh, April 19, 1914. {April 19, 5'30 p.m.) The Russian Government in their reply will, I gather, take act of my note, and state that they regard articles G and 7, &amp;c., as having binding force between the two Governments. His Majesty’s Government will therefore incur no unilateral obligations. If you do not consider this sufficient please telegraph how you wish the Russian reply worded.

It seems from text of your Excellency’s note as if His Majesty’s Government incurred a unilateral obligation without the Russian Government assuming an obligation similar to that of the German Government.

Dues shall be imposed, not for the mere fact of navigation, but only for administrative charges of the Commission referred to in Article 7 and for repaying sums actually spent on improve ments in the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and harbour facilities. They shall in no case exceed 1 fr. per registered ton (the dues to cover the coming in and going out of the same vessel) except by agreement between the two Govern ments ; any dues shall be levied on a basis of absolute equality without regard to the nationality of sea-going vessels or their cargoes.

He argued that declarations which affected Turkish territory and to which Turkey was not a party would be more likely to be unpleasant to Turkish Government than an exchange of notes, and mentioned that he was particularly anxious to do nothing just now to offend Turkev- He further stated that declarations would be more likely to give rise to unfavourable comment in Russian press. Although he admitted that these reasons were not very strong, he greatly hoped that you would consent to exchange of notes, which would be, he said, just as binding. [2034 2]Sir L.
