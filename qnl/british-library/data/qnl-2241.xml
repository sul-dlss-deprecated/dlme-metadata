The late Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali owned shares in this Company. .after his death a dividend warrant was received from the Company in his name and on making enquiries I found that the original share certificates had been mortgaged by him many years ago to Shaikh Mohoined Ali Zainal, the pearl merchant. Shaikh Mohomed ^li Zainal informed me himself that he had lost the certificates. There is no doubt however that he was given them by Shaikh Sir Isa in return for a sum of money, but they were 1were never transferred from Shaikh Isa to Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zainal. It is now necessary to transfer the shares to Shaikh Hamad, who inherited the whole estate of his father, and on this being done Shaikh Hamad will transfer the shares to Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zainal or pay to him the amount which he lent to Shaikh Sir Isa. I should be obliged if you could furnish a certificate to the effect that Shaikh Hamad succeeded his father and inherited the property and estates of his late father. I gather from the Company’s letter that this is what they require. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.

Memorandum: - I enclose a copy of a letter from the Manager, The Eastern Bank Limited,,Bahrain, regarding the War Stock previously owned by His late Highness Shaikh Hamad.

The correspondence concerns the transfer of the estate and property of Shaikh Isa bin Ali Al Khalifah [Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah] to his son, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah [Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah] upon the former's death in 1932, and from Shaikh Hamad to his son, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah [Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah] after Hamad's death in 1942. The need for the transfer, which was certified by the Political Agent, Bahrain, arose from the existence of shares in the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company Limited in Shaikh Isa's name, and of War Stock held in Shaikh Hamad's name with The Eastern Bank Limited.Folio 11 is internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000013#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
