L t ft ^ d'rfj Please refer to your demi-official letter Jiio .Ext.47 9/48 of the 3rd March on the subject of the appointment of a financial Adviser to the shaikh of huwait. 2. Of the four possible candidates you mention i much -prefer woods-Ballard who is very sound and steady-going. E arising to n-Hawes, from whom i have heard on the subject, promises in my opinion, too forceful a personality for the appointment. We must have somebody who while exercising a steady influence in affairs will not obtrude himself too much. 3. i consider that the pay of the appointment should not be less than Rs 3000/- p.m. tax-free. Prices and wages are very high in huwait. uther high otate officials, e.g. the Chief justice and Director of education are believed to receive as much as Rs 4000/- p.m. Bree furnished accommodation should be provided. 4. i spoke to the shaikh on the subject of the appointment on my recent visit to huwait and emphasised the importance His Majesty^s Government attached to it. He said he was himself anxious for the appointment but asked us not to hurry him. He quoted an Arab proverb to the effect that if you lean on a stick too suddenly it will break* whereas with gentle pressure it will hold. He went on to say that he was carefully preparing the way for the appointment. i understand from Tandy that the Shaikh has infonned him that the chief opponent of the proposal is Abdullah Halim, who as you no doubt are'aware, as the result of the troubles in 1939, was entrusted with the financial affairs of the state and recognised by shaikh Ahmad as his heir presumptive. unless the shaikh can either reconcile him to the proposal* or eliminate his influence, which will be diflicuit in view of the 19 39 settlement, he cannot go ahead with it. 5. At the same interview x tackled the shaikh on a rumour which i had heard that he intended to appoint an American doctor as head of his Health Department. He confirmed the report and said he had first tried to obtain the services of Mylrea (British) or Scudder (American) who are members of the American ^Dutch Reformed Church) Mission in these parts, but both had refused his offer. He had accordingly applied to **r. Potter the General Secretary of the Mission to find a suitable American doctor for him He proposes that the functions of this doctor should be administrat ive and that he should supervise the work of the numerous Egyptian and Syrian doctors who are employed by the state. x replied that if he was appointing an American Chief Medical Officer 1 hoped he would at least give us the opportunity of providing him with a -oritish financial Adviser. &lt;M^ CpA I 1 *' 6. it is a pity that the Shaikh has not chosen a British ^rather than ah American doctor but it would hardly be politic to object though i have asked Tandy to remonstrate with him at his not being consulted.

My dear Sir Rupert, As verbally instructed by you on the 31st January in Basra I have sounded the Shaikh as to whether he would like us to send him- a list of possible candidates and the terms which he would accept. He replied that the political situ ation in Kuwait was not in his judgement propitious for proceed ing further in the matter at present much as he would like to do so, and that he would rather the next move were left to him. 2. I think it is clear that he fears the opposition which might be aroused by a move at present and feels it neces sary first either to weaken the position of his opponents or to eliminate them. 3. I stressed the point that, if he should later inform us of his desire to appoint an adviser, we should be unable to produce a suitable man ‘'out of the hat' at short notice. Yours sincerely, 3d.

Major Harington-Hawes said that his first reaction was that he would like to be considered for the post but that he would of course need further information regarding terns, etc. before definitely committing himself. I said that no definite figutes had been mentioned but that we had in mind something like £2,000 a year tax free with free accommodation on a 3 years contract renewable by mutual consent. I said that either we or the Foreign Office would in due course let him know if anything more definite occurred about the appointment and he in his turn would inform us if he no longer wished to be considered as a possible candidate.■External Department. lifaU- Harrison.)

Secretary of State Perusal Subject : Appointment of a British Financial Adviser to the Sheikh of Koweit. Please see Mr, Hallows 1 note of 7th October, 1947 and subsequent correspondence. The present position as reported in the Political Resident's telegram No.53 of 14th January is not very satisfactory and we have in fact made little or no progress in persuading the Shaikh to engage British Advisers. Some reasons for the possible opposition to this appointment are mentioned in the Political Resident's letter of 28th January below. It looks as though the Sheikh could push it through if he really wanted but that he does not really want to do so at the moment. Probably the main reason is that he does not wish to give the-impression td^ellow Arab Rulers of being in the pocket of the British. I suspect also that the Sheikh may not be too anxious to see a British Adviser clearing up some of the administrative corruption and mal-practices in regard to large-scale smuggling into Iraq and Persia which are almost certainly going on at the moment and in which it has /been (29387' Wt.67762/P.60 5,000 3/46 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685been suggested that the Sheikh has an interest. This is all somewhat unfortunate particularly in view of the great developaents in oil production which are now going ahead at Koweit and which involve introduction of a great deal of unexpected wealth into the State with consequent JOtWls rises in prices and wages. All we can do, however, is to. try to persuade the Sheikh to take a Financial Adviser; we cannot force him to have one. ' W/T,' LLt' 7 l . ^ ^ /t. ^ ^ ^ ' » * //. 'mammm i 2. I regret the delay in complying with the request at the end of paragraph 4 for more information from which to assess the degree of opposition which might be encountered to the appointment. Tandy is of ©pinion that Abdullah Salim would not raise any serious @pp©sition to the appointment and that the Shaikh would be able to overcome any opposition on the part of the public. Should however Abdullah Salim wish to arouse the public against the appointment he would have much support from the following classes: (a) The politically-minded and the students who c®uld be persuaded to see in the appointment an inroad of British Imperialism and an insult to the administrative capacity of Kuwaitis. (b) The officials and others who are in a position to profit from corrupt and lay administration. (c) The opponents of the Shaikh wh# d® not wish to see his authority increased. I would add to these classes the mercantile community who would fear the introduction of controls such as exist at Bahrain. 1 was informed spontaneously by Khan Bahadur Abdur Razzaq who was at one time Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast during 1 my visit to Kuwait in isovemoer that the poorer classes are genuinely anxious for the appointment ©f British advisers to assist the administration. E.P. ^ ‘iy ow n view is that the appointment would be unpopular with almost everybody wh© really counts in Kuwait but that if Shaikh Ahmad makes up his mind to proceed with it he will see that it toes through without any serious opposition. On the other hand he will not proceed with it until he is satisfied that he can prevent such opposition. L/^7 / ly Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, LONDON. S.W.1 t r fDEPTL.

DRAFT LETTER .Ot L.F.L, Pyman, Esq., Eastern Department, Foreign Office, S.W.l. 13 OCT W SECRET Dear Pyman, We have recently been considering the problem which will emerge at Kcnareit as the result of the large surplus revenues which are likely to accrue to the Knweit Government from the royalties of the Koweit Oil Co. and from income from any concession the. ShSikh may grant for oil rights in the neutral zone. This problem was referred to in letter No, MES.167 dated 6th May, 1947* ftrom fp Jfcv. J Ik. Is- ^ *ZA * G-reenhill to Crawford of the British Middle East Office. In this letter G-reenhill mentions that oil royalties at Koweit will rise botw^en A 194$ 50 to £3i million per annum and that from 1950-55 there will be a further rise to £5 million per annum. We/We agree mth the view expressed by Greenhill i • * that a Development Scheme for KtJweit is necessary /•u' \U-k~lO A-VI *»!*««. in order that a large proportion of tho rovomie ^ b ^] -■ fi f 9 ' A**’ /ti*' rleriirerl from oil royalties should be devoted-te the provision of improved administration, public amenities and services and other benefits. It would seem however, that without the assistance of a competent Financial Adviser of integrity and experience, the Kuweit Government might find it difficult or impossible to undertake such a Development Scheme successfully, '£ou hJ ti A, l will, I-am sure, apx^reciafce thai^disastrous consequences whifthi might follow from this sudden acquisition of wealth should the Shaikh remain without the help and guidance of a capable administrator possessing a good knowledge of finance. As you are aware, the Bahrein Government has been assisted by suoh an offici-a-1 for over 20 years and the Sultan of Muscat is now most anxious to secure the services of syi officerto advise him 6a administrative and financial matters. The proposal to appoint a British Financial Adviser for Kuweit is not new # and briefly the, story about it is-as ^ follows. ^ During the disturbances which took place in Kuweit during 1938 and which took the form of an agitation for improved administration and for the formation of a £ ^ Cbuncil to advise the Shaikh, the Shaikh was asked whether he would accept a British Adviser. At that time he was unenthusiastic but later during a period of o-i. a agreement between himself and the Council he told the Political Resident ^ / u* /} 1 ^ (*-*- u ~&gt; that—he-would like to secure the services of ^n AdvHaer. B 1 or political reasons it was considered undesirable to pursue the matter further at that time and during/-i during the war the idea was dropped, in view of the obvious difficulty of finding a man of the / (\r- /]- / lvk » i * i J-s right qualifications. If the Political Resident raised the subject with the Shfclkh again in I&gt;iag &gt; dhL of^this year, who told him that he would like to accept the suggestion but that time was not yet ripe for it. There is little doubt that when making this statement to the Political Resident, the Shaikh, had in mind the opposition he might encounter from his cousin, Shaikh Abdullah As-Salim, who is likely successor to the Shaikh and who at present holds ' the post of Minister of Finance, 'the Shaikh has always regarded Abdullah As-S^lim with some suspicion in view of the part he played during tho 1938 agitotjron.

As I think you are aware, oil royalties at Koweit are estimated to reach the figure of £3i million per annum by 1950, rising to £$ million per annum by 1955 ; and in addition to this there is the substantial income which the Sheikh will derive for oil rights in the Neutral Zone.

So far as public opinion is concerned, we have very lit tire information on which to assess the degree of opposition which might be encountered, and to what extent this would be outweighed by those in favour^- /^* S' I should therefore be grateful if you would examine the question further and let me know in due course how you consider the ground might be prepared for a further approach to the Sheikh. ^^ /• **-/**&gt; ^ 1 •..inUtfOtiThe/ (: MEs. Donaldacm, So far, approaches to the Sheikh of Koweit in oonnection with the appointment of a Financial Adviser do not seem to have met with much success 9 and it is for consideration whether we have not now reached a stage when more active steps should be taken to secure the Sheikh’s agreement to this proposal. Briefly, the story of this proposal is that it was first put for ard by the Political Agent, Koweit to the Political Resident in the former’s letter of 19th March, 1938, written during the agitation against the Sheikh of that year. It was first put to the Sheikh in June, 1938, by the Political Agent, (Captain de Gauiy) who recorded that the Sheikh was ' surprisingly uneraphatic in his reply about the appointment of an Adviser. It may be that he has been expecting such an appointment and that the various statements which have appeared in the Press from his Secretary’s pen, to say that he has no foreign Adviser, and so on, have been merely an attempt to stave off what he has regarded as inevitable'. In August 1938, when serious dissension between the Council and the Sheikh had arisen over the question of the retention of the Sheikh's Private Secretary, izzat Jaffar, the Political Resident reported in his telegram of the 11th August that the Sheikh had asked for an Adviser, apparently to be selected by us. Shortly after this, the Political Resident saw the Sheikh, who informed him that he wanted an Adviser 'and everything as in Bahrein' • After discussion with Captain de Gauiy, Mr. Weightman, Acting 1 Y 0 /{_ j Political Resident, when reporting on the troubles at 'j- * Koweit, gave it as his view that to pursue the question of t,ie appointment of an Adviser at that time would be an error in tactics, as the Sheikh's request appeared to him to be little more than a move to break the power of the Council.The matter was not considered further until November, 1939, when Sir Geoffrey Prior, who succeeded Sir Trenchard Fcwler as Political Resident, stated in a letter to the Government of India of 9th November that he did not think that the time —v was suitable for pressing, the Sheikh to accept an Adviser, especially in view of the difficulties which would he encountered in wartime in finding a suitable man for the post* In recent time svje have had a letter from the Political Agent, Koweit, (Col. Galloway)* dated 20th June, 1940, in which he stated that he had received 'many hints and open requests' from some merchants for the appointment of an Adviser, and that such an appointment appeared to be the only way of removing the ill feeling towards us which, in his view, was caused by the weakness of the Subah administration* We have also received a letter of the 3 1 ‘d- August, 194-6, from the Political Agent, Koweit (Major Tandy), in which he states 'it has become clear that the opposition to. the appointment of a British Financial Adviser comes not from His Highness, but from Abdullah Salim and his clique, although His Highness would never willingly employ a 'Pooh Bah' and lay himself open to the taunt that the Adviser ran the State' • We have also the view of Sir Rupert Hay, expressed in his letter of 13th March, 194-7# that 'it is probable that he (the Sheikh) is frightened of public opinion and of the handle which the appointment of a British Adviser would give Abdullah Salim for propaganda against him'. Fran Sir Rupert Hay’s letter of 20th January, 1947, it appears that when, the subject of a British Adviser was raised by the Political Agent, the Sheikh made the remark that he was not a traitor to his State* In reporting this interview the Political Agent stated that there was an influential body of opinion which would stigmatise the appointment of a British Adviser as a betrayal of Kcwreit to the British* Sir Rupert Hay’s view of the matter appears to be that it is possible that the time will come when the Sheikh will himSelf ask for an Adviser and be able to cany public opinion with him, but that it would be a mistake to force the pace* There/ ' rThere appear to be the following arguments in favour of the appointment of a Financial Adviser:- Z-' &amp; 1-cJuJ ric^ A. &gt;: V (a) We are now informed that according to the Ministry of Fuel and Power, oil royalties at Koweit will rise to £3i million per annum by 1950 # and further to £5 million per annum by 1955* Koweit is thus suddenly to acquire enormous wealth and if the management of this is not in the hands of a trained administrator, the results may well be disastrous. It is desirable that a large proportion of this money should be ploughed back into the St3te in the form of improved administra tion, public and social services etc. This will in itself mean a large scale development programme requiring the guidance of an experienced hand, (it may be noted here that a further substantial income can be expected from a concession covering the Sheikh’s rights in a neutral zone,) (b) The 1938 agitation against the Sheikh was able to gain ground owing to the low standard of administration at Koweit at the time. It is desirable to remove any such potential cause of unrest. ^ (c) Unless a Financial Adviser is appointed, it seems clear that the Sheikh will lean more and more on the Oil Company for advice in connection with matters concerning samel improvements at Koweit, (d) The influx of foreign labour on a large scale for work with the Oil Company will necessitate consider able improvement in such things as police administration, and it may well be found essential to employ British police officials as was the case at Bahrein, The/„ ■ - - .r.-y—r-r-1 — ■ ^Fk.dr, The ™ rt -»n difficulties in the way of securing the Sheikh’s assent to the proposal are:- (1) The possible opposition of Sheikh Abdullah as ^alim; and (2) Public opinion# So far as (1) is concemed f I feel sure that with a little judicious flattery, coupled with scrae arrangement to preserve his position in the State, it should not be difficult for the Political Agent to secure Sheikh Abdullah’s cooperation# The first step towards securing acceptance of the idea is to /3 wtta+- a-r'V'nrtfrATnrovt' .ci Ar*f» TIBCeSSarV to win Sheikh possess is not sufficient on which to base an opinion as xo how strong opposition to a British Adviser might be, and to what extent it would be outweighed by those in favour.

It has since transpired that the information I received that the Shaikh had recently given the Kuwait Municipality a cheque for Es 5,00,000/- against his royalty was incorrect.

India Office, LONDON. G.A.M.fEPARTiJiNT. NOTES FOR REGIST}-0&gt; * REGISTER NO. EXT. 749 &amp; 755/47. KUWAIT-FINANCIAL POSITION FOR USE BY DEPART .ENT ONLY Attention is invited to the notes at Ext.-4928/46 flagged. It has been felt for some time that all is not well with the management of Kuwait’s finances and efforts have therefore been directed towards putting this matter on a more businesslike footing. Two proposals have been put forward:- (1) the publication of a budget, , and (2) the appointment of a British Financial Adviser. The Shaikh himself has not been opposed to either of these courses but he seems to be very much in the hands of Shaikh Abdullah Salim, the President of the Council and head of a rival faction in the State (and who is suspected by the Shaikh of habitua]Lmisappropriating State funds). Abdullah Salim however, has/X m A A has so far yielded to«pressure as to agree to the publication of a rather makeshift statement of accounts for the Kuwait Revenue Department for the Mohammedan year ending 24th Rovemoer, 194o, and this statement is now submitted together with comments by the Political Agent and Political Resident* The note by the Resident at Sxt. 755/47 makes it clear that income from oil royalties is not credited in the account of the Revenue Department•} The Political Agent, thereioie, seems justified in raising a query on the references to monies paid by and owing to the Kuwait Oil Company* Col* Hay, however, doubts whether it is necessary for us to make enquiries from the Kuwait Oil Company in London* The Company may not be at all willing to disclose information of this nature and as the Political Resident does not ask us to pursue the matter we may perhaps consider it unwise to intervene* Oil royalties-are paid by the Kuwait Oil Coiipary in London and transmitted by the Imperial Bank of Iran to Kuwait, where the money is kept in an account in the Shaikh's name quite separate from the State finances. The Shaikh evidently feels that he is putting the money to good use and we have his^ assurance that none of it goes to the Privy Purse.^ But in view of the exoected increase in this particular lorm of .wealth it is satisfactory that he now agrees that a statement of accounts should be prepared and published annually in the future* The Shaikh has apparently decided to appoint a Mudir of Finance to share with Abdullah*Salim the responsibility for financial administration in the State. The Mudir will presumably be a Kuwaiti subject, but it is not clear how this joint responsioility will work out in practice. It is apparent that the Shaikh does not yet feel that he can carry public opinion with him in asking for a British Financial Adviser and we may conclude that Abdullah Salim’s powerful position is not likely to be shaken by the new arrangement* It was at one time suggested that the Shaikh of Kuwait mi ht ask for an Egyptian (or Syrian) as Financial Adviser, and although there is nothing in the present correspondence to suggest that the Shaikh has this under serious consideration, it may be worth noting that in a recent Residency letter (March 1947) and elsewhere, Col. Hay has remarked on the growing friendly relations between /'( Kuwait and Egypt. ;;452 I &lt; .

In Kuwait it is kept in the Shaikh's name, separately from the Finance Department's account. Only the Shaikh can operate on it and he has recently given the Kuwait Municipality a cheque for Rs.5,00,000 against it. This confirms what the Shaikh told me himself viz. that the money was paid to him in London and that he distributed it amongst department He said that he was keeping none of it for his privy purse.

Sir ) i I have the honour to forward herewith a statement of accounts for the Kuwait Pie venue Department for the Muhammadan Year ending the 24th November 1946, together with a copy of a covering letter received from the Political Agent Kuwait. This is the first statement of accounts ever received from the Kuwait Government. As the Political Agent's letter shows, it covers the activities of only one department but that the most important one. I doubt if it is necessary to msRe the enquiries from the Kuwait Oil Company in London suggested by the Political Agent in paragraph 2(i)(c) of his letter, but I propose to ask him to endeavour to obtain the accounts from the Supply Department, vide paragraph 2(iii)(a), about which there has been a certain amount of sc a ndal, and also to try to persuade the State to invest a portion of its balance, vide paragraph 2(iii)(b). 2. I have been informed by the Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company in Kuwait that the Shaikh is at present receiving about Rs.5, 00,000 a month as royalty and that in a year's time this figure will probably have increased to Rs.15,00,000• This means he is already receiving twice as much royalty as the Shaikh of Bahrain and w r ill soon be receiving six times as much. At a recent interview &gt; I pointed out- 2 - CH-oJ I pointed out to the Shaikh tnl ^responsibility tnat devolved upon him from the possession of so mucn v/ealth and asked him how he proposed to spend it. He sale that the royalty was paid into a bank in London, that he made allotments from it to the various departments his Government at his discretion. None of it was appropriated for the Civil List. New hospitals and schools are under construction and plans have been made for an extension of the customs pier and new warehouses. The Shaikh further promised that a statement of accounts lwould be prepared and made public every year. He said 1*^ ^ -i -O ^ His Council had selected four candidates from whom he would choose a Ludir of finance and that this Mudir and the President of the Council (Abdullah Salim) would both be responsible to him for the |financial administration. I reminded the Shaikh that if he wanted us to supply him with a financial adviser we could readily comply. He replied that he would like to accept our offer but that the time was not yet ripe for it. As previously reported I think it probable that he is frightened of public opinion and of the handle which the appointment of a foreign adviser would give Abdullah Salim for propaganda against him. • » 3.

The ilon'ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BaHRaIN'. 7 A \ 4 Subiact:- Accounts of the iG i|i$t Revenue Deoarimanl. / Sir, I have the honour to encl 98 e translations of the documents recently laid before the Advisory Council by Abdulla Salim as a result of your remarks to His on your last visit to Kuwait on the desirability of producing a State Budget. The documents do not, of course, constitute a btidget: nor do they deal with the total revenue of the State, but only with that of the Revenue department ( ;laliva ). The other departments whose accounts are not included are:- (i) Mucatjoa. (Income 1/i of the value of all ^oods imported into ivuwait, 30,o of the profits of the Landing &amp; Transportation Company and the extraordinary grant of Rs.2,61,000 from the Revenue department) (ii)Public Health. (Inoone likewise U on the valueofimports and 30% ot the profits of the Landin and Transportation Company) (iii)gluniciaalitv. (Income s?4 on the value of imports and a house-tax). 2. I have the following remarks to offer on the accounts:- (i) Annual Statarafliri. Insomfl (a) As will be seen frora the note at the foot of the second statement (Balance Sheet) the annual statement should nave opened with a balance brought forward of Rs.38 ? 82,727-2-9 ps and concluded witlk balance carried to Balance Sheet of h;a.3,800,032-9-0 ps. (b) The first three items totalling Rs.13,37,792- 6-0 ps should amount to of the value of all imports except those for Shaikhs, the Agency, and the Kuwait Oil Company. The value of imports should therefore be in the neighbourhood of £.2,S00,000 for the year. (c) The item of Rs.200.000 received 'on the oil concessions' cannot be explained by the company here as all these payments are calculated in, and made from London. I do not like to cross-examine the Kuwait authorities on these accounts and recommend that an enquiry be made from the Kuwait Oil Company in ‘London as to how this sum and the sum of Rs. 16,00,000 referred to in paragraph 2(iii)(c) was arrived at. (d) The Sulphur Concession...had kapt the previous year's payment in his private account until ne heard that accounts for public display were in course of preparation. (ii) Annual 3 tat agent. SxpQftflifcUCfi (a) It is useful to know the extent of sums appropriated by the Subah family from the State revenues. These appear to have totalled 22/o of revenue. (b) The ^ant to Shaikh Abdulla Mubarak was. I believe, made because of that gentleman a very heavy expenditure and exiguous resources. He has not. like other members of the oubah family, a large private income apart from ’.dmt he is paid by the State. (iii) balfiyagfLi.&amp;g&amp;fr (a) Rs.419,279-9-9 os are due from the Supply Department whicn have not published any accounts. It is desirable that these should be produced. (b) It is understood that all the sums shown as due from banks are in current account and that none of this monev is invested in gilt-edged or other securities. (c) 7^/t 7 The sum of Rs. 1,600,000 due to the Kuwait Oil Company is presumably on account of advance royalties received, out it is not known how this has been arrived at, nor is it known whether royalties accrued but not paid up to the date of Balance Sheet have been taken into account. 3. These accounts were sent to me by His Highness’ secretary (at, I believe, the request of Shaikh Abdulla Salim) with a simple covering note requesting their return when I had done with them. As I was not asked for ray coranenta I have not offered any nor have I yet mentioned the matter to the Shaikh • 4. I have Heard that Shaikh Abdulla Salim took offence and left the meeting when the State Advisory Council wished to discuss the accounts, but I cannot vouch for the truth of this report.

Certain irregularities in the distribution of the Kuwait sugar quota have recentiy come to light and under my instructions Tandy has seised the occasion once more to point out to the Shaikh the desiraoility of appointing a British Adviser. The Shaikh while discussing the matter made the remark that he was not a traitor to his State and Tanay reports that there is an influential body of opinion which would stigmatise the appointment of a British Adviser as a oetrayai oi Kuwait to the British. It has to be remembered that Kuwait is much more truly Arao than either Bahrain or Muscat and in much closer touch with modern Arab movements and the appointment of a British Adviser there at the present moment would almost certainly be the subject of much criticism both within and without the State. .It is possible that the time will come when tne Shaikh will himself ask us for an Adviser a nd be able 1 to carry public opinion with him but it would be a fmistake to force the pace. 3.

My dear Colonel Hay, Before leaving Kuwait, I spoke to His Highness about the undesirability of allowing Fahad as Salim to take over charge of the Finance Department during Abdullah Salim's absence. His Highness' reaction was interesting: he asked me to speak to Abdullah Salim about it. This I accordingly did, and I heard before leaving that Abdullah Salim had abandoned his intention of aestivating in the levant. .He may since, of course, have changed his mind again as he is notor iously fickle. 2. The conversation naturally led on to the question of the mismanagement of the State Finances, and His Highness asked me to speak to Abdullah Salim strongly about the necessityfd? a budget. This I did on the same occasion as 1 spoke to him about his brother, anc^replied that it would be done. 3. In the course of the conversation, it appeared that His Highness was convinced that the 'Aulad Salim' habitually misappropriated State funds, and that he would be only too glad to have someone independent of them, and whom he could trust, in charge of the finances. In this connection he volunteered that a British Officer was the only solution as he would have no.faith in Egyptians or Syrians ( he has presumably seen too much of how Bin Baud's Syrian employees have served their master). 4. It has become clear that the opposition to % the appointment of a British Financial Adviser comes not from His Highness but from Abdullah Salim and his clique, although His Highness would never willingly emplby a 'Pooh Bah' and lay himself open to the taunt that the Adviser ran the State, I think it would be beneficial to maintain the pressure, and would like to be able to show His Highness and Abdullah Salim some of the past Bahrain budgets (and possibly Administration Reports; and enquire when we may expect to see similar statistics in Kuwait. If,you agree I should be grateful if I could be provided with ammunition of this nature from Bahrain. Yours sincerely, Sd. M.P.O'C. Tandy. The Hon'ble Lt. Colonel W.R.

HARRISON M inistry of kUel and Power, 7, JUllbank, S,«r.1.(£%) I have spoken to Mr. Weightman about this, and a.’ind tliat he feels it would he desirable for us to reply to Col. Hay welcoming his idea of encouraging the Sheikh* s inclination to appoint a British Financial Adviser in Koweit, if a suitable man can be found. He did not think however, that the adviser should limit his activities strictly to financial matters, but should be competent to advise on economic development of the State, as well as the investment of its funds. If possible, v/e should be ready with the name of an individual who could be recommended to the Sheikh for this purpose, so as to forestall any proposal that Assyrian' oir Egyptian National should be put in, instead of a British subject.

Hay gives ! his views on Koweit*s financial future now that the revenue is i likely to increase by Rs # 4 lakhs per month (£ 360,000 per annuia - i # e. the same as Bahrein's total revenue) with the start of operations by the Koweit Oil Company. Koweit finances are a mystery presided over by Sheikh Abdullah Salim, who is second in Koweit only to the Sheikh of Koweit himself and belongs to the rival party. Col. Hay thinks therefore that although the Sheikh realises the need of a British financial adviser (who should not act as if he were prime minister), he would not perhaps risk offending Sheikh Abdullah b 3 '- doing sc, and inviting criticism from other Arab countries. Col. Hay thinks we may have to view favourably any prox^osal to appoint an Egyptian or Syrian, (ltd.) S. J.P( icciotto) 23 / 7 . it/•» It seems to me that, with a revenue of over a year and the possibility that this may double/even treble itself., within a few years, the Sheikh of Koweit (and as the protecting power) will be exposed to justifiable criticism if he does not do something to set his financial house in order, and make some effort to plan for the economic development of this very poor and backward State. It will perhaps not be very easy for the Political Resident to put this over to the Sheikh, and it will probably be not at all easy for II.M.G-. to find a suitable adviser, but it seems to me that we ought to start very soon to take steps towards this end. As regards criticism froul Iraq, it may be worth while pointing out that the Iraqi G-overnment t he jus elves seem quite,. willing and even anxious to take British advisers. The other Arab States will no doubt do what they can to bring Koweit into the Arab League fold and the idea of the Sheikh having a Syrian or Egyptian adviser would not I think be at all welcome to us. We should be in a much better position if we ourselves took the initiative in suggesting a British adviser rather than if we waited until the Sheikh was intending to engage a Syrian of Egyptian, and then had to try to persuade him to engage our cfvTn“'-oandid.^te.’LE COPY £f) A COiM-tf' .lDj^T xax« uffice of the flo. 0/420 . jjrom The Hon 1 hie hi eut .-Co ion el v#R.

C/415 da ted th e 7th ^ hi/ 19 ^6 1 ’ the revenues of huwait are lively to be increasedr~tb the extent of at least four lakhs a month now that the Kuwait Oil Company has gone into production. 2. The Stated finances are at the present handled oy ohaikh Abdullah Salim who is usually con sidered the next most important person in Auwait after the shaikh and is the head of the rival faction of the As Subah. He has a great reputation for honesty but nothing is known about his financial ability and the State’s finances are wrapt in mystery. The only department which publishes a budget is Hie education Department. The Manager of the local branch of the imperial Bank of Iran informed me confidentially that the State now had over ten lakhs of rupees deposited in his bank and that Hie sum keeps on increasing. The money is lying in the Hank without paying any interest and is becoming an embarrassment to the Manager. 3. in an interview i had with the Shaikh I suggested to him that in view of the greatly increased revenue the Htate was now expecting to receive the time had come to put its finances on a proper footing. He replied that the State would endeavour to do this and athat if it failed he would ask us to find somebody [to do it. i also suggested to the Hhaikh that surplus funds belonging to the otate should be invested and not left idle. The Shaikh said nothing definite in reply to this except that he had private money of his 6wn invested in the united Kingdom, India and Kuwait. 4. i think the Hhaikh realises the necessity of obtaining outside assistance for his financial affairs and as long ago as 1944 the Political Agent reported that the ohaikh had stated to him that the Htate finances would never be properly run until he had a uritish financial Adviser. He is probably however afraid of offending Hhaikh Abdullah if he ousts him from his present office and he is also reluctant to face the 'criticism which will inevitably be directed at him from Iraq and other countries if he employs a Hritish Adviser. unless i receive instructions to the contrary I do not propose to press the ohaikh further for the time being. ohaikh Abdullah is old and infirm and it is possible 11 want to retire from / public2 public affairs before very long# i consider however that in due course the btate must obtain outside help in the direction of its finances and every reasonable opportunity that oft ers itself for pointing this out will be taken. if the Shaikh himself suggests a Syrian or Egyptian as Adviser we shall nave to consider the proposal favourably# my own view is that it is preferable that there should be a .aritish financial Adviser in huwait if a suitable man can be found, what is required is a really competent financier and 1 do not consider it essential that he should know Arabic. He should limit his activities strictly to finance and should not attempt to become a Prime Minister like Mr. Belgrave in Bahrain. 5. i am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India. i have the honour to be, Sir, iour most obedient servant Political R&lt; 9 HHjUIX) In 1932 the Goverrujent of India ordered that in :0L1 cases where Rulers of the Gulf States show a desire to en^aoe ^ the services of Europeans* and also of Iraqis* Syrians* Palestinians* Egcrptians and natives of North Africa in positions of inportance* a report should be nade to then beforehand vide copy of P &amp; P Department letter attaolied, • I am inclined to think that these orders are now somewhat out of date and that it should be left to the olitical Resident to insist on prior information being given him of such appointments to such extent as he ncy consider necessary and to refer to a d the Government of India orOy where the appointments are of outstanding importance (e.g* appointments of Chief Ministers or financial Advisers) or when it is desirable to make enquiries regarding the antecedents of the persons to be appointed. or instance it hardly seems necessary to trouble the Government of India with prior information regarding the appointment of European nurses in the Bahrein otate Hospital* (d.)

This was against the background of the increasing revenues of Kuwait, derived from the country's burgeoning oil industry. A Foreign Office letter of March 1948 expressed concern that Kuwait and Bahrain, which were relatively two of the more important of the Gulf shaikhdoms, did not appear to have realised that 'the increasing strategic and economic importance of their states' demanded an improvement in their present standard of administration in order to carry out a programme of administrative and social reform, and so avoid political agitation and economic unrest in the future (folio 6).The papers include correspondence on the subject from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent, Kuwait; statements of account of the Kuwait Revenue Department, 1945-47 (folios 41-44); papers concerning the management of Kuwait's finances; and discussion of the names of possible candidates from the Indian Political Service to fill the position of Financial Adviser.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
