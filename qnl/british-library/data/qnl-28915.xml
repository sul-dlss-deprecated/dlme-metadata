E.44A 8379 and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Foreign Office London. December 22nd 1919 &gt; J Sir, With reference to your letter No .P.6435 of the loth instant, on the subject of Land Policy in Mesopotamia, I am directed oy Earl Curzon of Kedleston to state, for the information of Mr.Secretary Montagu, that the assumption in paragraph five of your letter under reference, that this Department letter No. 128145/M.E.44A of the 19th of September referred in particular to agricultural lands, is correct. 2. While His Lordship considers that the general principles on which the letter from this Department was based, ; should be kept in mind as a guide in all transac tions of the nature of those now proposed, he fully realises that individual cases must be dealt with on their own merits. 3. In this connection, however, I am to observe that the views expressed below are not intended by His Lordship to be interpreted as referring to any possible transactions in the Mosul vilayet, in which area he is of opinion that concessions should only be granted in very exceptional cir cumstances, and after a reference to the Home authorities in each case. 4. The proposed transactions appear to fall under four main heads A. The sale or lease of agricultural land, in respect of which Lord Curzon adheres to his previous ruling, as expressed in this Department’s letter No.128145/M.E.44A. B. The taking over of running military concerns, as for example electric power stations, which would otherwise, The Under Secretary of State, collapse India Office.collapse. His Lordship considers that cases of this nature should he dealt with at Mr.Secretary Montagu^ discretion. C. Sales of land, allocation of sites, or grants of concessions for public works of obvious utility to the inhabitants, and of urgent importance, such as water-works. These cases, as those referred to in the preceding paragraph, should, in His Lordship's opinion be left to Mr.Secretary Montagu's discretion. In this connection, however, I am to observe that motor-tramways do not appear to be urgently necessary. D. Concessions to business firms, such as the Cawnpore Vtoollen Mills, and the paper-pulp factories, which might reasonably be regarded as being primarily in the interests of the concessionaires, rather than in those of the in habitants. His Lordship deprecates concessions of this nature being granted pending the final settlement. 5 . I am to add, with regard to the proposed civil station in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, that Lord curzon would prefer to await further information on the subject before expressing an opinion. 6 . In conclusion, I am to state that while His Lordship has every sympathy with the difficulties inherent in the greatly delayed Peace Settlement, he feels sure that Mr.Secretary Montagu will appreciate the international considerations which lead him to deprecate a premature launching out into operations which might well prove a source of embarrasslment via-&amp;-vis the future Government or of Iraq, with other Powers.

A I am Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant,ORDER. Whereas by Section 12 of the Proclamation, dated 28th December, 1917, of the Geneial OtHcei Commanding it is provided that the Civil Courts shall not until further order give any judgment involving a decision as to the ownership of agricultural land unless a certificate Jias been granted by the Civil Commissioner or an official authorized by him that there is no objection to the suit being heard and decided and by Section 20 it is provided that agricultural immovable property shall not be sold in execution except with the consent of the Civil Commissioner or an officer authorized by him :— And whereas by a notification, dated the 1 1th February, 1919, signed by the^ Officiating Civil Commissioner the Revenue and Financial Secretary was appointed the officer authorized to grant certificates for the hearing of suits relating to agricultural land under the Proclamation of the 28th December, 1917 : — Now, therefore, the Officiating Civil Commissioner hereby authorizes the officers named below to grant certificates for the hearing of suits and consents for the sale of agricultural property in execution under Sections 12 and 20 respectively of the said Proclamation, that is to say— {a) The Political Officer of the Mosul Division as regards immovable property situated in that Division. {b) The Revenue Secretary as regards immovable property situated elsewhere in the Occupied Territories.

(Para.10 of telegram). .ana y iin s. The individual proposals arc being dealt with on separate jz+ kj fiJU'e-j files.but they involve certain broad principles^which require decision. 4. The present position as to the sale or lease of land is stated in Foreign Office letter dated (jTo. The position is somewhat misrepresented^vide my minute on Pi-gA./VJ. The fact is that under existing regulations the Civil Commissioner has not parted with authority to sanction transactions involving the sale of land but such transactions require his previous concurrence, vide notification No.4 of 1917, (copy below). 0 5* The point is whether Foreign Office letter should be interpreted to veto &amp;tC transactions involving the transfer of agricultural and urban realty to non-Mesopotamians, Hf/ mitairafc ^ case definite instructions should be sent to Col.Wilson, or whether this restriction should be confined to agricultural land. There seems a strong case for the latter view.Under Ottoman Law persons of any nationality can hold land in Turkey provided they agree to0 r ( 2 ) to abandon their rights under the capitulation^Xn fact private individuals and commercial firms already own buildings in Baghdad and recently (vide Col. Wilson / / // has sanctioned the sale of a building site in Busrah. Agairi when in April the development of the Naft Khana Oil Fields was discussed in London Col.Wilson stated that he could arrange to provide for the land for the building of a refinery and hia authority to do so was never challenged. It would seem a little late in the day now that the work must be well advanced^ to deny his competency. On a broad view it is practically impossible entirely to restrict the acquisition o.i land by foreigners a's legal enactments can be evaded by trusts and by formation of companies, e.g. the case of the Travancore Minerals Co. 6 - It is suggested that we ask Foreign Office to consent to the acquisition of business premises and building sites by commercial firms at the discretion of the Civil Commissioner. £ The second principle involved is that of concessions. In dealing with the oil problems the Foreign Office have told us that they have laid down the policy that neither concessions nor even licenses to prospect should be allowed to be operative. This policy was enunciated with reference to mineral concessions. It is possible that they would not object to the grant of such commercial concessions as are involved in the scheme for the Najaf water supply, the Kurna water and light supply or the Busrah tramways. We may at least press for further definition and support Col.Wilson 1 s views: ^ / ^ iOBitiit fact not ale rils nRegister No. SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. -from Legram Dated Rec.

In forwarding jto be laid before rU Earl Curzon of Kedleston copy of the marginally noted telegrams which have been received from the Acting Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia relative to the grant of commercial facilities to approved firms, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to invite attention to your letter No, 128145/M.E.44, dated September 19th on the subject of the sale or lease of agricultural lands. 2. Mr.Secretary Montagu does not propose in this letter to discuss in detail tie various projects to which Col.Wilson refers, out there are certair] questions of broad principle which arise from them regarding which he would be glad to be favoured with the advice of Lord Curzon. 3. The schemes under reference appear to contemplate, inter alia, the lease or sale of Government and possibly of private lards to commercial firms for business sites in town areas. 4. Mr.Secretary Montagu is disposed to suggest that a distinction might be drawn between realty of this nature and the agricultural property which he had particularly in mind in his letter to which your communication of Sept. 19th was a reply. It would seem that ! r. therethere is some small misunderstanding as to the powers of the Civil administration as hitherto defined. Under Ottoman Law it was competent for the nationals of any country to acquire real estate in Turkey provided that in so doing they agreed to abandon any special privileges which migjit accrue to them from the capitulations. Sir Percy Cox (vide notification bo.4 of 1917, copy of which is attached for ready reference) restricted this competency to the extent of requiring persons other than Mesopotamians desirous of acquiring land to obtain the previous consent of the Chief civil authority; and on at least one occasion (vide correspondence forwarded to you under cover of my endorsement No.P.4707 dated August 21st) Col.Wilson has exercised this authority. By notificatipn No.58 dated July 30th 1919 enclosed herewith, (the precise effect of which in certain particulars is under enquiry these provisions have been affirmed aid extended,/to all leases exceeding a period t of three years ^ ^Ja ^ k °M. jJIu. 5. Mr.Secretary Montagu would therefore suggest for the consideration of Lord Curzon that the policy approved in your letter under reference, at least in so far as it concerns privately owned real estate, should oe understood to apply a*i only to agricultural land.' /l ( /W J / PjA Draft Paper.

With re^rd to the sale or lease of State land, Mr.Secretary Montagu agrees that there is no authority competent to bind the future Government of the occupied territories. At the same time action has on occasion: been taken involving 'the disposal of Government land. Mr.Montagu understands that 'the War Office has in preparation a scheme for the building of a cantonment which will presumably be ^ *,6rA£- fo sited on State domain. Again on April 8th when the development of the Naft Khana Oil Fields was discussed in London Col,Wilson stated that he was able to provide land for the site of a refinery to oe erected by the A.P.O.C. in the vicinity of Baghdad. It v/ould appear that the land in question was Government land and Col.Wilson f s authority to act as he suggested has not hitherto been challenged. While Mr.Montagu would insist that no lease or sale^' should be permitted without previous reference to H.M.G he is inclined to think that under the circumstances arising from the continued delay in the final settlement of Peace with Turkey it would be advisable not to place an absolute veto upon the entertainment t by the authorities in Baghdad of *- proposals involving the^disposal of m i iy i HSoras schemes which are at present under cons ids rati 021 are for the oovious benefit of the civil population e.g. the)Water Supply^annot be effected without some user of G-overnment land:- and Mr.Secretary Montagu 'hvl*C&lt;r^cLu+,*&lt;L; * o^-fU' •gfer&gt; TgyCTt aria: oynt 7. There remains the question of concessions, it is understood that the ^7 policy is that no concessions should be granted.

An inler-depar1 1 nental Conference was held at the India Office on the 8th April 1919, to discuss the question of oil policy in Mesopotamia. The following were present :— Sir Thomas Holder ness (in the Chair). Lieut.-Col. A. T. Wilson, Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia. Sir Frederick Black, Admiralty. Mr. J. C. Clarke, Petroleum Executive. Captain Jelf, Petroleum Executive. Mr. A. P. Waterfield, Treasury. Captain Hough, Department of Overseas Trade. Mr. E. Weakley, Foreign Office. Mr. J. E. Shuckburgh, India Office. Mr. Nicols, Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I. 2. Colonel Wilson dealt with the question of the retail sale of oil to the civil population in Mesopotamia. He explained the existing arrangements under which the local interests of the Anglo-Persian Company and the distribution of their oil are entrusted to managing agents. (Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co.), who are also merchants and carry -on a variety of activities, by no means confined to the marketing of oil, in India, Mesopotamia, and the Persian Gulf. He regarded this arrangement as faulty in principle ; and he further criticised the methods followed by Messrs. Striek, Scott &amp; Co. as tending to make the price of oil to the consumer unduly high. In the interests of the civil population, he could not allow the cost of an essential commodity to remain unrestricted ; and he proposed, unless an arrangement for the control of i prices could be reached, to vest the retail distribution in the civil administration. As an alternative he suggested (1) that Messrs, Strick, Scott &amp; Co. should be eliminated, and that representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, dealing- exclusively with oil, and acting in direct subordination to the 1 )irectors in London/ should be appointed in their place ; and (2) that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should agree to sell oil to the population at a limited price to be fixed by the Civil Administration, plus a minimum percentage. 3. Mr. Nicols replied on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Colonel Wilson’s criticisms. He did not think that the immediate elimination of Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. would be practicable ; but he assured the Conference that it had never been the policy of his Company to “ exploit ” Mesopotamia, and that they were quite willing to accept civil control over the price of oil. Eventually, after considerable discussion, Colonel Wilson submitted the following proposal as the basis of an agreement between the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company : —- (i) That the Company’s agent at Baghdad shall be authorised to deal direct with the Civil Commissioner in all matters relating to the sale and distribution of oil in Mesopotamia, and to make all arrangements on the Company’s behalf. (li) That the price at which oil is sold wholesale by the Company to Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. shall not be in excess of the average rate at which it is sold wholesale by the Company to Government. (id) That the commission payable to Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co., shall be fixed by arrangement with the Civil Commissioner. The Civil Commissioner would then be in a position to fix the retail price of oil. 4. The Conference recommended that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should be formally invited to accept an arrangement on the above lines. 4 he India Office representatives undertook to take the necessary action. The representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Air. Nicbls) then left the meeting.2 IL 5 Colonel Wilson raised the question of the oilfields at Naft Khana, situated on the Perso-Iraq frontier in the neighbourhood of Khaniqin. The diplomatic situation as affecting this area may be briefly stated. The Turco-Persian frontier was delimited in 1914 by a mixed Commission including representatives of Great Britain, Russia, Persia and Turkey. The Commission completed its proceedings just before the entry of Turkey into the war, but its conclusions have never been ratified by the Govern ments concerned Prior to the actual delimitation, the Turks agreed (Annex B to Protocol signed at Constantinople 17th November 1913) that the rights acquired by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company under their concession from the 1 ersian Government should be maintained in full force in any areas, previously Persian, that might be assigned to Turkey by the Boundary Commissioners. By the same Protocol the Persian Government agreed to forego all rights to royalties, &amp;c., in respect of the “transferred territories.” As regards the particular area now in question, a “ Declaration ” signed by the British and Russian Commissioner in May 1914 recognised the fact of its occupation by a Persian tribe (the Sinjabis), thus bringing it within the scope of the above provisions. _ n 1 1 n 6 Colonel Wilson explained that boring operations had been started at Ratt Khana in 1918, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company undertaking the work on behalf of the military authorities. The Company take so confident a view of the potentialities of the field, that they have dismantled a refinery in New Zealand and have had the plant shipped to Basra for the purpose of dealing with the Naft Khana output. The field is indeed likely to prove as rich as those already worked by the Company in Persian territory. Colonel Wilson took the view that the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Naft Khana should be maintained ; but he considered it desirable that the field should be worked, not by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company direct, but by a separate Company—an offshoot of the parent Company—formed for the purpose, with its head office at Baghdad. He could arrange to furnish t he Compa ny with land for a refinery and pipe' line. The Mesopotamian Ad ministration would expect to derive some revenue from the field. 7. Since the meeting, Colonel Wilson has put in the following short note on the subject: — “ I venture to urge that the Petroleum Executive be moved, when informing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that their rights in Naft Khana area have been confirmed, to stipulate that if and when a new Company is formed tn work this area, the Treasury should have 55 per cent, of the shares, as in the case of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It is essential that a new Company should be formed, as provided in the protocol. It is. also, in my judgment, essential that the Treasury should have participation and control to at least the same extent as in the case of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. “ The rights of the Iraq State as the successors of the Turkish Government are already safeguarded by the protocol.” 8. -The Conference accepted Colonel Wilson’s view that the rights of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Naft Khana should be maintained ; and they concurred generally in his recommendations for the working of the field. m. 9. In conclusion, Colonel Wilson referred to the negotiations at present in progress at Paris for the disposal of future oil interests in Mesopotamia. He explained that oil is the only immediately available asset of the occupied territories, and the only real security that the Iraq administration are in a position to offer for the loan which they will undoubtedly require in the near future from the British Treasury. He felt grave misgivings about an arrangement, the effect of which would be to hand over to a comparatively small number of shareholders the whole interests of the Iraq State and of the British Treasury in what might well prove to be the richest oilfields in the world, in exchange for nominal control over oilfields not in British territory which might or might not be effective in practice. He pointed out that such a policy would be the exact reverse of that adopted by His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Persian oilfields. It would be opposed to the present trend of opinion in favour of nationalising certain essential industries such as electric power, transportation services and coal, and would be very difficult to defend in Parliament or elsewhere. It would, moreover, be likely to arouse American opposition. Colonel Wilson estimated the capitalised value of the Mesopotamian oilfields at about 50,000,000b . ^ India Office, 10th April 1919.Previous Papers :—4? / 9 V Telegrai'n from Civil Conimr,,, Bagdad, dated 3/10/15...

I attach great importance to this clause, which will go far to assist important British and local firms who are becoming restive under long continued uncertainty. We owe it to them and to ourselves to enable them to start wprk at once.

Sir:- I am directed by Earl Curzon of Kedleston to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.P.4613 of the &lt; 11th September, enclosing a letter from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, giving cover to a draft procla mation on the subject of laid policy in Mesopotamia. Lord Curzon concurs in the opinion expressed by Mr. Secretary Montagu, that there is in present circumstances no authority in the occupied territories competent to grant the^proposed twenty five year leases of state laads, or to prejudge the policy of the future Iraq Administration in this respect. Lord Curzon vaitures to observe that paragraph four of the draft notification leaves it to be sup posed that if the lease is terminated through causes within the ccntroi of the civil administration, a claim will lie against the civil authorities. This appears t « The Under Secretary of State, India Office. nrr 1010 Copy n r ' w ‘' JAGDADr* f* appears to presuppose that the future administra tion of the country will necessarily agree with the line now taken by the British Military Authorities. Reasonable as this assumption may appear in view of the probability of His Majesty's Govexnmmt obtaining the taandate for Mesopotamia, His Lordship considers that the possible alternative should not be lost sight of. The sale of land held under private ownership appears to His Lordship to be open to the same ob jection. it is not possible for His Majesty's Govexn- men g to foresee the line which the future Government of Iraq will take on the question of alienation of land, and lor this reason he considers it undesirable that the veto on the sale of privately owned land to persons other than domiciled inhabitants of Mesopotamia should be removed. so long as the British Military Authori ties are aoministering Mesopotamia to trust for its future Government they are bound to administer the Turkish lav/ as closely as possible. Lord Curzon under stands, however, that the Turkish land laws are strongly opposedr ■I r opposed dy certain elements of the population of Mesopotamia. This being so, His Lordship foresees that the recognition by the British Military Authorities of transactions involving the alienation of land to approved foreigners might be objected to by the future administration of the country, on the ground that the title of the vendor was in correctly assumed by them to be valid. ‘ His Lord- ship sees no objection to the Civil Commissioner being invited to submit, for the consideration of His Majesty*s Government, a draft of the regulations by which he would propose that the sale of land to persons other than domiciled inhabitants of the ^ occupied territories should be governed, but he \ suggests that the considerations outlined above should be brought to the notice of the Civil Com missioner when the enquiry is made. His Lordship's view is that no transactions involving the sale or lease of state or privately ownedowned luds to other than domiciled inhabitants of the occupied territories should he acquiesced in by the British Military Authorities, except on the understanding that such transactions are en tered into without prejudice to the decisions of the future Government of the country on the general questions of land tenure and land alienation. He is consequently opposed not only to sales of privately owned property, but also to long leases of either state or privately owned lands to outside persons until the political future of Mesopotamia has been decided at the Peace Conference. - I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant.Minute Paper.

The scheme submitted by the Civil Commr: seems much too sketchyjand it leaves points which are obviously of cardinal importance undetermined. Nor has the effect of any extensive granting of leases of State land been closely exam ined . 3. As regards the purchase of the rights of private individuals by non-domiciled persons,and (e) of para: 3 of Mr: Garbett’s minutr, the question of securing for the State a share of the unearned increment would seem to be a separate matter, distinct from the question now under consideration. Any such measure would,it is presumed, be adopted as a matter of general State and agricul tural policy,irrespective/purchases by non-domiciled persons, and applicable generally throughout the State. Subject to this suggestion,there would appear to be no objection^f%oro tbe -V —of view— 0 *—~ 1 of this I 1 opt-:-to the proposal. 1 4. State leases stand on a different sstx footing. Experience in India suggests that it is essential to examine the problem in all its aspects,and to deal with the subject in full detail,before satisfactory results can be attained. The question of control is hardly touched on,for example,in the Civil Comm’rs letter; the limitations as regards area ( which are of paramount practical importance) are not mentioned; and there is no indicati- on as to terms ( the crux of the question from a practical point of view). An infinity of trouble,and of economic loss, | will be saved by careful attention to general policy and ! practical details at this stage If,as appears from Mr: Garbett’s minute, the major problems regarding irrigation,labour, (13,231).

The State would not .now what it was giving;and it would almost certainly find itself most seriously x embarrassed later on by the powerful interests which it had cr ted.( I have had six years experience in an Indian district wh large land grants were given,in the Mutiny days,to European settlers. The system did not,I think,work satisfactorily;the grants were left to develope themselves;and they advanced at no faster pace than they would have had no grants been made.They reased enormously in value,and the Govt: now find they have al ated properties which would have brought in very large revenues, without securing anything in return. Opinion in India trends very strongly in favour of the Canal Colonies system,as in force in the Punjab. ) 20/8/19. mc- xen- ‘ jib CibZ, * ^ [ ~k/I~ A Mrcrt-Z c cU-*. o,Draft Paper.
