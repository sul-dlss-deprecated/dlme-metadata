Only in very few and exceptional cases is a Chief in the Aden Protectorate named in the terms of the State (or more properly speaking, District) of which he is the Ruling Chief, and even in these cases, reference is made rather to the chief town (or towns) in the District, rather than to the District as a whole - for example, the Sultan of Lahej, the Sultan of Shihr and „ukalla etc. In all other cases, the Chief is named in the terms of the Tribe of which he is the ruling Chief. 3. In the Schedule submitted with the draft notifica tion, all the Chiefs therein mentioned are Ruling Chiefs in the sense of the note to sub-section 5 of Section 8o of the Civil Procedure Code, in that they are the principal persons of a distinct tribe. Furthermore,all are in Treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. 4. I have, therefore, altered the wording of the ENCLOSURE rn ID1A FOREIGN oEORETARY'8 \ scheduleDRAFT NOTIFIGATIQN.

Please see the Government of India’s letter dated 23rd May regarding certain proposals made dy the Chief Coninissioner at Aden for the improvement of conditions of service of the District and sessions Judge. This matter was discussed, in minutes helow, with the S.&amp; G. and Financial Departments. The view of this Department has been modified in the light of the discussion and a draft letter is now submitted which accepts the Government of India’s proposals, except that a flat rate of special pay (Rs.250) is fixed instead of an incremental scale (Rs.200-50-300). The flat rate was originally proposed by the Resident ana is in accordance with the usual practice. It may be necessary, if it proves impossible to attract suitable men on these terms, to consider this matter again. It will, of course, be a Colonial Office responsibility very shortly. secretary. G.

The change necessitates an amendment in the Superior Civil Service Rules* and the Government of India have accordingly forwarded a draft Resolution for the approval of the Secretary of State in Council. At the same time the Government of India deal with certain proposals made hy the Chief Commissioner in regard to the remuneration of the District and Sessions These proposals were put forward hy Sir Bernard on the basis of representations made by the present incumbent* who was transferred to the post at short notice from Bombay Presidency* and found on arrival that the conditions were not nearly so favourable as he had hoped. The Chief Commissioner’s actual proposals are ( 1 ) that a conveyance allowance of Rs.75 a month should be granted, and ( 2 ) that the existing local allowance of Rs.200-50-300 a month attached to the post (which* of course* is not drawn during leave) should be converted into special pay at a consolidated rate of Rs.250 a month; with retrospective effect in both cases from the 4 th October 1934* The Government of India do not consider either that a conveyance allowance is required or that retrospection should be given* or that the local allowance* which they agree should be converted into special pay* should be made a flat rate instead of an incremental scale. As regards the last point, the Government of India’s attitude seems to be quite reasonable* for an incremental scale naturally holds out an inducement to an officer to1 2. continue to serve at Aden, which a flat rate would not ' r offer.'

On the other hand, there are most cogent reasons for treating this particular post in the most generous manner possible, in connection with the arrangements for the transfer of Aden to H.M.G., it was agreed that a proportion of the administrative personnel for Aden would continue to be drawn from the Indian Services. The post of District and Sessions Judge is one of those which it is anticipated will continue to be filled from India. For this reason it is essential to attract good men to the appointment and it is, therefore, of vital importance not to display any stinginess in regard to terms. e Quite a good case, on commonsense grounds, appears to have been made out by the Chief Commissioner for the granting of conveyance allowance, and in view of the considerations pointed out above, it seems desirable, if possible, to persuade the Government of India to change their mind in regard to this proposal. As regards retrospection, it seems important that, if possible, the present incumbent should not leave his post in a too disgruntled frame of mind, with the consequent danger that he may dissuade his colleagues in Bombay from taking on the job.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council to refer to your letter dated 23rd May, 1935, No. 45 , on the subject noted F. 18 V35-Judicial above. The Secretary of State observes that the Government of India have already informed the Chief Commissioner that they do not consider that a case for the grant of a conveyance allowance to the District and Sessions Judge has been established. As regards the conversion of the existing local allowance into a special pay, the Secretary of State agrees that the grant of special pay is justified. He feels, however, that there is no sufficient reason in the circumstances of the present case to depart from the usual practice of fixing special pay on a flat rate, and he prefers the Resident’s original proposal to the proposal for an incremental scale put forward by the Government of India.

The Secretary to the Government of India, Home Department. Proposed conversion into special pay of the local allowance of Rs.200-50-300 attached to the post of District and Sessions Judge, Aden. Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of 3761 5000 5.35 State in Council to refer to your letter U5 dated 23rd May 1935&gt; No.P. 187 / 35 -Judicial on the subject noted above. The Secretary of State notes that the Government of India do not consider / s' that the rate of the existing local allowance should be altered, as proposed by the Chief Commissioner, when it is converted into special pay, and His Lordship agrees with the Government of X x X X India*s conclusions for the reason x ♦ X / which you give. / / He feels, however, that the Chief Commissioner*s proposal in regard to / retrospection is a reasonable one, and that the grant of special pay should date from the commencement of the present incumbent’s tenure of office, viz. hth October 1934; he trusts that the Government of India will see no objection to this alteration in the draft * Resolution. As regards the Chief Commissioner*s proposal for the grant of a conveyance allowance at Rs.75 per mensem, His Lordship notes that the Government of India/India do not consider a case has 'been made out. No reasons are given for the Government of India’s decision, which, no doubt, is based on the general principles applicable in India, and the Secretary of State hesitates to question the conclusions of the Government of India on a matter of this kind. He feels, however, that it is important to treat this appointment as generously as possible, since it is one of those which, it is expected, will continue to be filled from India. It is most desirable that it should be so filled, but it will be difficult to maintain the arrangement^ unless the terms are sufficiently attractive to secure the services of men who are in all respects suitable. It further seems unnecessary to apply Indian rules too rigidly in view of the approaching transfer of Aden. His Lordship would accordingly prefer, unless the Government of India see any overwhelming objection, that the Chief Commissioner’s proposals, both as regards the conveyance allowance itself and as regards retrospection, should be accepted, in view of the considerations set out above and of the comparatively small amount involved# He trusts that the Government of India will, on reconsideration, be prepared to agree. No steps are being taken to adopt the draft Resolution enclosed with your letter, pending the receipt of the Government of India’s concurrence in the grant of special pay retrospectively./ 3* In his telegram No. 2582, dated the 23ra Y September 1926, the Secretai'y of State sanctioned a local allowance of Rs. 200-50-300 a month lor an officer of the Indian Civil Service holding the post of Judicial Assistant at Aden. As reported in the Home • Q.l Department letter No. 23/F.205/34-Judicial, dated the • 1st March 1934, the designation of that post has been changed to District and Sessions Judge. The Government of India are satisfied that the conditions on which the grant of special pay is justified are fulfilled in this case on account of the trying climate of Aden, and the specific addition to the officer^ work and responsibility- They agree that the local allowance should be converted into a special pay* but see no sufficient grounds for altering the present time scale of m. 2O0-5O-300 to Rs. 25o/- as proposed by the Chief Commissioner, as the time scale has trie advantage of offering some inducement to officers to remain in Aden. They are also unable to agree to the proposal of the Chief Co lissioner that retrospective effect should be given to this arrangement. I am therefor e to request that the Secretary of State in Council may be moved to sanction the proposal as thus modified, and to issue a resolution making the necessary aaendments in the Superior Civil Services Rules a draft of which is forwarded for his ^consideration. The draft includes the amendment referred to in the Home Department letter No. 23/F.205/34- Judicial, dated the 1st March 1934.

Davies, I.C.S., District ana Sessions Judge, Aden. Claim for conveyance Allowance and a fixed Aden Local Allowance by- I have the honour to refer to your Department's letter No. 439-E dated the 29th September 1926 to the Government of Bombay in the Political Demrtment, and to submit for the favourable consideration by*the Government of India, a copy of a letter No.J/748 dated the 5th December 1934 from Mr. R.W.H. Davies, ICS., the District and Sessions Judge, Aden, in which he has preferred the following requests: (a) that he be granted a conveyance allowance of Rs. 75/- per month and (b) a fixed Aden allowance of Rs. 250/- per mensem instead of tne Local Allowance in the time scale of Rs. 200- 50- 300 as drawn by him hitherto. 2. In the circumstances explained by Mr. Davies, I strongly recomend that his request for a conveyance Allowance of Rs. 75/- per mensem be sanctioned by Government. 3. I understand that in the Bombay Presidency and in Sind, a District and Sessions Judge is provided with an official residence within reasonable distance of die Court, and that in no case are they so far apart as to call for more than a trifling expenditure for the purpose of the journey. 4. In Aden there is no house suitable for theDistrict ar -^ Dessiorjs Judge within a short distance of oourt, the only suitable one available being the h^use wmch rie occupies at atea-ier Point, which is live miles from the Court. The District and Sessions Judge is thus compelled by unavoidable circumstances to - r iarCe each day a long Journey, which apart from wear and tear and expenses on his own car, .involves him in heavy expenditure on taxis if his own car is out of order. O. As regards the question of tne Local Allowance I do not see any objection to its being fixed at is. 250/- a month instead 01 the present scale ox fe. 200-50-300, ana to its being termed 'Special Pay' as the proposal will not involve Government in any additional expenditure J ‘ I alJ 0i iicer appointed as District and Sessions Judge reuiaius in Aden lor at least three years, as in my opinion ne normally should do. I therefore recommend that one Government of India be moved to sanction this charge. A'o i egaids uhe GUg^esuion that the local allowance should be drawn on leave, I invite your attention to this Residency letter No. 5731, dated trie 15th Septanber 1J34 m connection with which no orders have yet been isai ed by the Government of India. 1 * • ^-vies has referred to the question of the acquisition by Government of the privately owned house which he at present rents. This proposal is under my consideration, and I shall address the Government of India separately regarding it. °* ^ ^' ie Government of India see no objection, I request that the proposals submitted in this letter be sanctioned with retrospective effect from 4th October i^o-, the daueon which Nr. Davies assumed charge of his d ou.eo -n Adeu, and miat an additional allotinent to cover trie expenditure during the current year be placed at myCopy of a letter No. J/-748 of 1984, datea tde 5til December 1984 from tiie District ara Sessions Juage, iiden, to the Chief Corirnissioner, Aden. In reference to my d.o.letter on the subject of the Judge’s allowances dated 13th October 1S34, and your d.o. reply thereto from Capt. T. Hlckinbotham datea Cord October 1934, I have the honour to state that I have now been in Aden for 2 months and am in a position to have formed some idea of the cost of living at Steamer Point. As regards the absence of any conveyance allowance, I can only say that the matter appears to me to be exceedingly unjust. The Judge’s official residence is at Steamer Point ana as has been stated frequently before, the Court is more than 5 miles av^ay in Crater, as regards tnis residence, the plot of land was originally given to the landlord on condition that he constructed a residence thereon f r the Eirst Assistant Resident, a political appointment at that time. When the post of the First Assistant was cancelled, the bungalow was handed over for occupation to the Judicial Assista-t, os he was then called, and nas finally devolved on the District and Sessions Judge, which appointment I now hold. Negotiations are actually in progress at present to take over this bungalow on benalf of Government. The District and Sessions Judge has every day to perform a journey of more than lo miles to and from Court, and for this he is in no way recouped by Government. The journey includes tue climbing of a, steep gradient with very difficult be;-as and much trafficr &lt;B traffic causing a considerable amount of wear and tear on a car. Not only are these journeys necessary, tut as the Judge has wide powers in Auer, i u also occasionally to proceed to Shaikh Othinan lor inspection purposes, to attend the Residency wren su-U-ioned there, to inspect the Jails and so forth# Actually I own an Alvis car, which is very right on both Petrol ana lyres. I have worked out my actual expenditure per month on these G-ovemmett jonri-eys allowing for depreciation and find that it always exc-. Ks. 60/- and is so.net Lies more. No allowance of any kind is given to cover this deficiency. X may add that the Go ^anuant of Police, who is the onlv other Police or 1.0.3. Bomoay Gr^^c^cil in Aur.-, has the sane jurisdiction as the Sessions Judge and receives a conveyance allowance of Ks. 300/- a .non mi• I may further state that under the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Regulation, the District and Sesoj-ons Judge may exercise all the functions oi the District I anistrnte, except in Sessions cases tr^eu bp tin at he is el s o Leg a 1 ; ^6m br an c e n, As sis ucii j u Commissioner of Income fax and Registrar General and receives no extra remuneration for the perf• r.ance these duties. In the matter of what is known as Aden or Local allowance drawn by the District and Sessions Judge, I may say that so far from a fforuing any compensa i^n in the matter of deficiency of a conveyance allowance, on that score also the District and Sessions Judge is very seriously at a disadvantage. rhis disadvai:tage, x May say,say is particularly serious in iqy own personal case* I am in India on the Bombay cadre a coi.ibi .ieu Judge and Sessions Judge and ay confirmation dates from the year 1932. Previns to oexng enployea in Aden I was posted in the District of Ahmeanagar, a station with an excellent climate in the Bo;nDai , - Deccan, and one of the best, if not the best Distric. in the Bombay Presidency. Mr. Jest on, who «as ay- predecessor nere, was promoted to the post ox Judicial Commissioner in Kathiawar. I was at that time the only Euro ye an Judge in the whole oi tne oornoay Presidency and iind* In view uf die vagary he* * a* - necessity for appointing a European, tne Government of Bombay wrote to me asking if I was willing to co..*e to Aden, as 1 had only been at Ahmednagar for »* monus tiiey requested me to reply by wire. It was not possible for me to obtain any information about Aden in the circumstances arid chiefly to oolige Goverriua.t I stated that 1 was willing to come to Aden, not expecting of course that my treatment would oe any the less generous forhaving done so. mr my arrival here, I find that the Aden allowance oi m. oao/- appearing in the green book againo* *.x. Weo* 0 u s name was not payable until the completion of the second year of service in Aden, and that during the xirsu y ear is. 200/- only is the allowance. Ire amouri*, after deduction of income-tax, reduces in my cast to m. 175/-* Practically the whole of the &amp;. 75/- is lost in paying my way backwards and xorwards to Courts every day. In addition, 1 find the cost of living very much higher in Aden than in one ordinal,, Districts in the Bombay Presidency, hot only so, but tnis so called local allowance cannot be drawn by the Judge when he is on leave, even for a snort period.3o far as the Gon.ianaant of Police is concaiTjed, in addition to his conveyance allowance of Rs. 2oO/-, he ^ets further special pay of Id. 200/- which is pa^'ahle on leave. I do not know why the district and Sessions Judge has been singled out for such ungenerous treatment. I find after two months here I am actually the loser by my transfer to the extent of Rs. 100/- a month. I have in addition obtain'ed a post which is extremely isolated, being the only Indian a climate which Civil Service post in /Aden, and secured is incomparably inferior to that of Ahmednagar - ail this because I volunteered, at the request of the Bombay Government, to take up my present post in Aden. I have the honour to request that a conveyance alio- ance may be sanctioned for the District and Sessions Judge of Rs. 7b/- a month and that instead of the Aden Allowance being from Rs. 2J0/- by yearly rises of Rs. 50/- to m. 300/-, it be fixea at a uni for. a rate of Rs. 250/- largely for the reason that quite clearly the first year in Aden is the most expensive. I have further the honour to request that this allowance nay in future be entitled 'Special Pay' and nay therefore be drawn on leave. The result will be that the Judge* s allowances will amount to Rs. 325/- every month instead of Rs. 300/- as they do, when a Judge has been here mo re than three years. I may add that it is not possible for me to stay in Aden more than one year, as with the knowledge and permission of the Bombay Government I am in process of being called to the Bar and circumstances do not admit of :.iy taking the final examination later than 1937. I cannot therefore remain in Aden until the allowance of 300/- becomes payable.joie allowances of ta; District arid Sessions Judge will thus total Ks. 75/- less than those of the Goa/and? nt of Police, who is s,s I have olre&amp;uy stated v,e only other Police or I.C.s. Officer on the Aden establishment. I wseif can see no reason why the District and Sessions Judge should he so much the less generously treated. I may add tnat my preaecessor due to the possession of Judicial pay ai.d great-er seniority drew It. 700/- per month more than I uo.XEt 4 #tg LW &lt;4 rr-- u ^ 5527 r Copy of a letter No. 4520, dated Adah, 29 th j C June 1935, from the Acting Chief Commissioner, Aden, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla.

From this it would follow that if tnere verd any material alteration in the duties of a post reserved for an All-India Service officer it would os necessary in virtue of Rule 14 of the Cla sification Rules for the approval of the Secretary of State In Council to be obtained to such material alteration of duties.

In moot cases no doubt ouch reports like reports under Buie kb would call Tor no action on the part of the Secretary of State. Please let me have your vievfe on this question and further on the specific question whether the aaelgasaation of the duties of director of Public health wit those of the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals would, in the opinion of the Government of India,vamount to material alteration of the duties of the Inspector General of Civil Hoo^itttla. For the purposes of Proposal Ho. IBb read with paragraph 7E of the Introduction to th^ vhite Paper it is essential that under the aew constitution the Secretary of State should be able to regulate the general nature of the duties of a post held by person® referred to in Proposal Bo.185. If therefore you feel any dwubt whether the term 'character” can bear thie meaning in Indian administration it would be necessary to substitute an expression which will convey the meaning required and in that event it would be desirable that this should be done in the first instance by amendment of Eule kA of the existing Claasificution Hulee before the Constitution Act is inauguuated so a** to secure continuity in the conditions of control exercised by the Secretary of State under the present and the new Acts.

Dear Laitliwaite, •) r o / In con\ r ersation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the point that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 8. New Laws anu Lnactments . In my opinion all existing (Indian) laws and enactments ought to remain in force, and the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure ought to be retained. But it will be necessary from time to time to make new laws, enactments and regulations and to modify ola ones. Such changes will probably be infrequent, and I hope that it will not be necessary to appoint a new official for the purpose of drawing them up. But the method and machinery for doing so must be considered.(The references in the note-below care to the points raised in Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly’s d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. 8. New Laws a nd Enactmenta . There was general agreement as to the desirability of rettilning in force all existing Indian laws find enactments, including the Indian Civil and Criminal _-s Codes and Procedure. There was also general agreement as to the desirability of some elasticity. While change ;orobably be infrequent it was important that it should be possible to make them if and when occasion &amp;rose without, e.g., the necessity of passing an Act of Parliament or the like, it was thou^it that the simplest course would be to provide in the initial Act of Parliament or Order in Council that all laws etc. already in force in Aden diould continue in force until otherwise provided: and to give the Governor power, with the consent of the Crown, to enact laws. The concurrent power of the Crown to legislate by Order in Council would be retained, in accordance with the usual practice in Crown Colonies. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in certain Colonies and Protectorates, e.g. St. Helena, Gibraltar, and Somaliland, the Governor, who had no legislature, made his own laws, subject to disallowance by the Crown (l.e. Colonial Office). As regards drafting, the oimplest thing would be that if there was no urgency in regard to any law or enactment the Resident shouldask the Colonial Office for advice on drafts prepared with&gt;*N the assistance of the Judicial Assistant at /den. In cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do the test he could, leaving any errors or loopholes to he remedied later. _ _ ——mm (S&gt; Register No. Political Department.

In the light of Sir Edward Gharrder’s remarks the draft Regulation which the Government of India have submitted in replacement of the Aden Givil and Criminal Justice Act 1864 and certain amending Acts was sent for comment to the Colonial Office with an explanation that the change appeared to he no more than a matter of proceaure, raising no question of substance and arising solely consequent on the recent transfer of the administrative control of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India and the establishment of Aden as a Chief Comnissioner's Province, 2. Subject to the elucidation of two points, which have now been satisfactorily aisposed of in the light of consultation with Sir Edward Chamier, the Colonial Office concur in the action proposed and a draft telegram to the Government of India sanctioning it is attached. Colonel Reilly tells me that he has emphasised to the Government of India the desirability of securing that these alterations are made well in advance of any separation of Aden. Otherwise the jpolitical effects of modifications in the law (even though they are of procedure only and not of substance) nay well be unfortunate locally, since they will be taken by the local population as an indication of the probability of further changes, possibly of a much more radical character, in other fields, under the administration of the Colonial Office, i/i* Lo*¥rxA&gt; flu ar o *Draft Paper. f.z.

Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter No*P.Z.2117/33 of the 21st of April regarding the draft regulation to replace the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act 1864 and certain amending Acts. The intention of Section 23 of the draft regulations is not altogether clear to us, but we assume that the object is merely to assist the Somaliland Courts by enabling their decrees to be enforced against persons or property within the jurisdiction of the Aden Courts, If this is correct, we have no objection to the Section. Apart from this, we have no comments to offer on the draft, which I return herewith. The point has however been raised whether, if we take over Aden, we should be free to make whatever J.G. LAITHWAITE, ES$whatever provision seemed proper to the Secretary of State in regard to procedure prior to appeal to the Bombay Courts. Roberts Wray assumes that this would be so; but you suggested that there might be, for all you knew, some technical difficulty. Perhaps you would ask Chamier about this?' v Lagal Aaviser, Ihese are proposals to replace the Aden Civil * and Criminal Justice Act 186^ (copy attached) hy a Regulation to make provision for the administration of just^_. Courts doth Civil and Criminal. The change is suggested consequent on the decision to transfer tne administrative control of Aden from the Government of Bombay to tne Government of India and the establishment of Aden as a Chief Commissioner’s Province. 2. I shall be grateful for any comments you may have to make on the draft. Prima facie it seems to be no more than a natter of procedure and if this is the case,—should no question of substance arise, the balance of advantage would seem to rest with promulgating the Regulation as soon as possible and in any case before the separation of Aden from British India takes place.
