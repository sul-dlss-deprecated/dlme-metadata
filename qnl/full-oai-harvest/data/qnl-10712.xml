The file also contains a limited amount of direct correspondence between Ibn Sa'ud and Knox (in Arabic with English translations) and correspondence from the Foreign Office in London and the Foreign Department of the Government of India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
