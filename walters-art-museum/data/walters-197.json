One of his generals, Ptolemy Lagus, was sent to Egypt to serve as governor after Alexander's sudden death in 323 BC. Ptolemy eventually crowned himself king and founded the Ptolemaic Dynasty. One of the early rulers of this Dynasty is represented in this elegant, life-size head. The Ptolemaic rulers were sensitive to the political needs of their diverse subjects. Therefore, royal portraiture is mainly of two types, one in strictly Egyptian style, like this head, and the other purely Greek.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1924", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/12551", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1924, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.017", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.109_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.109_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.109_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.109_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.109_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2360", "Images": "PS1_22.109_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
