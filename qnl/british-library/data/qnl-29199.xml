Copy of D.0. letter dated Quetta 22nd May, 1913, from The Hobble Lieut .Colonel J. Ramsay C.S.I. C.I.E. Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan. % People are getting very inquisitive about the possibility of finding oil in Baluchistan , and incidentally I have been asked to give a map of the Gwadar-Kalat boundary. As far as I can make out the boundary has never been demarcated or even defined , but from what Keyes , who was recently ^ Assistant Political Agent in Makran, tells me , the boundary is fairly v/ell known locally. It seems to me most desirable to get the boundary definitely settled and marked before any valuable minerals are found in an area which might be disputed. Do you see any reason why I should not officially suggest that the boundary should be defined and demarcated next cold weather? If not I will raise the question • I should have no difficulty in getting a representative of Kalat , and the Assistant Political Ageht could overlook things generally • If the parties on both sides came to an agreemant nothing more would be required , but in case of a difference of opinion could it be arranged,as far as you are concerned, that disputed points should be settled by the Political Agents of ^ Kalat and Maskat? Dew, the present Political agent in Kalat is pretty sure to go down to Makran next winter and probably there would be jjo difficulty in arranging for Knox to meet him • Have you any surveyor available or should I have to provide him? Kalat would pay half the costs . Would there be any difficulty about Maskat paging the other half? If Maskat would be likely to object I daresay we could get over the difficulty.22 . T Bushire, 15th June 19 ^ 3 My dear Ramsay, a ^ • Please see your letter of 22nd May regarding the Kalat- G?/adar boundary question. From the same point of view from which you advocate it, I agree, subject to any observations which Knox may wish to make, that it would be convenient to get the bound ary settled, but there is, I imagine, no documentary material to go upon and there has been such wide divergence of view in the past as to where the boundary is that 1 think we need to narrow the issue down, if possible, to some definite zone of uncertainty before taking the matter up officially ? For ready reference I attach a rough tracing from the 8m, to the inch Survey Sheet, showing approximately the 3 known versions of the frontier which have been heard of:- (i). the frontier said to be claimed by Balueh sub jects of the Sultan. (I should think we might rule this out to start with, if it is revived). (ii)« the Kalat version. (iii). the Gwadar version. Would Hobble Lieut-Colonol J.Ramsay, C.I.S., Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, Quetta.?/ould you approve of the respective Political Agents en deavouring to get from the Sultan and the Khan of Kalat privately, ostensibly in connection with the Railway Sur vey, their paper version of the boundary ? Then we can see roughly what the task is we are likely to have to tackle, I am sending copies of the papers to Knox and if you can wire me concurrence in the above proposal he can go ahead# Yours sincerely, (sd) P# Z. Cox.am OOlIFIDJDyTTIAL. 25. BRITISH AGE1FGY AIT'D CONSULATE, MASQAT. June 19 tin 1913, A 0 Dear Sir Percy, / With reference to your Deni official dated 15th: June 1913, forwarding copies of correspondence regarding the, Kalao-Gwadur Boundary I iiooe I shall not he charged with 'obstruct -ion if I say that I hesitate considerably about accepting Colonel Ramsay’s suggestion in his D/0 that « disputed points should be settled by the Political Agents of Kalat and Mascat ' My position in faspat is very different from that of Dew in Kalat aid I am Very reluctant to undertake the duties of a kind of joint chief umpire in a matter between nominally Kalat on the one side and Masqat on the other . The whole scheme is sure to misrepresented to the Sultan as an insidious attempt on tl^e. part |o yob him of iis rights and win do neit ier me nor my successors any good in our reflations with the Sultan to be mixed up in it . I venture to doubt a good deal whether Mahnood Khan , Khan of Kalat would care two pence which way the decision went , as he probably has long ago come to the conclusion that fekran has gone from him and, from the local point of view , both in Masqat and fekran , the question at issue wii be regarded as between the British Government on the one hand and the independent Sultanate of Oman on the other . is the British Consul,Masqat , the proper person to be chief umpire in such a matter^more especially when his influence win be counter balanced by a political Agent from Baluchistan ? I cannot see how such an arbitration can be expected to command the Sultan’s confidence , At the same time , i am greatly embarrassed to suggest a suos bitate , for where are we to find an independent Umpire ? I should oe inclined to^^uggest that the Sultan should it r ! .veBe asked to name a representative and informed tiiat tiie Mian of Kaiat will name anotiier . If we reach as far as getting him to agree that the joint decision of the two representatives will he accepted Toy him , provided that the Khan on his part equally agrees to accept the same decision , I could then consult him as to what method he would suggest in the event of a difference of opinion between the two arbitrators . possibly some local totable might be found wh6 would command the confidence of both sides and I think the best thing for the British authorities would be to keep out of the way except in so far as to insist that whatever boundary line was chosen should be clearly and permanently demarcated , so that there should be no possibility of dispute afterwards . It would seem an advantage not to have that too imoortant )eoole chosen as arbiitators , so the decision of / the chief umpire , if unfortunately called for , should command more confidence than that of the other two. The kind of person I have in my minds eye as chief umpire would be some person like the head Gitcliki Sirdat and for ordinary umpires , some local Baluch headmen . perhaps we could get the two Baiuch arbitrators to name their umpire in concert between themselves, before they begin wrangling over the boundary . This should lead to finality . I hope these remarks may be useful .

It would, obviously, greatly enhance the figure of the lease or purchase of Gwadar if an oil spring were tapped within the Sultan’s limits.

He asserted that both travellers and caravans with goods from the interior especialty from Persian Baluchistan were being prevented from entering Gwadur. Since it was such caravans who used also to taice back goods purchased in Gwadur into the interior, a considerable loss in revenue from customs duty was being suffered by his State. Secretary said that he nad no information on this matter but that tne action alleged to being carried out by the Kalat State was certainly not being done urmer instructions from the Government of India.

Sir, I have tne n&lt;»iour to refer to your letter i*o.?.564~V37 # dated the 22nd December 1937, asking for a*y comments on the application by tne Buraah Oil Company for a prospecting license in Gwadur* 2. The situation appears to be tmt tnere are two oil Companies in the field for the *&gt;vadur concession i.e. the Indian Oil Concessions Ltd• representing 5GD American and British Indian interests (vide paragraph 2 of India Office telegram Ho.2809 of tne 26th November 1937), and the Bur man Oil Company Ltd., which is of course a British concern. It is presumably preferable from our point of view that tne latter should be given at least an equal eha'ce of obtaUsing the concession. 3. I appreciate Dr• Garce* s general arguments that previous to the giving of a concession it would be better for tne two States of Kalat and Muscat to come to a reasonable compromise over their trade differences and also to demarcate their frontier. The following, however, has to be borne in mind. Though the hultan cannot actually give an oil concession to any Company /Company without the approval of the Government of India (aee Undertaking hy the Sultan of Muscat regarding oil 1923 at page 319 of A itches on* a Treaties Volume XI} there is nothing to prevent the Company starting negotiations with his Mignnees. If t therefore* we were to try and restrain the Buman Oil Company Ltd. t who as an entirely British Company may fee more under our influence than their rival*, from opening negotiations with the Cultan, there is nothing to prevent Indian Oil Conces sions Ltd. from approaching him. This they might do through the Standard Oil Company of California during his Highness 1 * tour either in America or in England. 4. On the balance of advantages, therefore, I am in favour of allowing both Companies to negotiate with the Suitan forth with, and l suggest that they should he informed accordingly. * 5.

The Government of India have considerably more experience of demarcating boundaries than I have, but they may find the following suggestions of use. (a) Some sort of small boundary commission will pre sumably be necessary. This commission might con sist of the Political AgentsMuscat and Ralat, and representatives of the Muscat and Kalat States* (b) In drawing up the terms of the commission a final Arbitral Authority will have to be included, to whose decision both States will submit, in case of dispute between the two States as to any section of the boundary which cannot be decided on the spot bj^ the commission. Such disputes may well arise since in the event of oil being found anywhere near the frontier, it may make considerable difference to (Signature) th , (Designation); C 7 ?/ 1 the States concerned where the frontier line actually runs* arbitral Authority raifejht be the Government of India* (c) I have little idea how long the commission v/ill take over its labours* f ihe frontier to be demarcated is not extensive, but there may be disputes to be settled* (d) It would I think save much time if before the commission actually met, the Survey Officer, referred to above, made an accurate map of the area through which the frontier would run* He could be accompanied by the State representatives who would later be members of the commission* For this purpose the Survey Officer could start this preliminary work at Gwadur on the 1st October, or whatever was considered a suitable date* (e) Re the expenses of the commission* I do not know what the ordinary procedure is, but as in this case the boundary is being demarcated for the benefit of the two States concerned, in order that they may con clude oil concessions, i suggest that they - the States - should bear in equal proportions at least some of the expenses of the commission as well as that of the preliminary survey* This might take the form of sharing all expenses except the salaries of the Government of India Officers employed. This will at least ensute that both States have a motive for expediting proceedings* u ■broached to the Sultan the subject of settling the frontier he was very firm on the point that he could have no direct relations with Kalat, but could only negotiate through His Majesty’s Government. ihis is, of course, quite correct, and for the Present purpose, as Kalat is under the Government of India, it is through the latter that negotiations must take place.

Discussions with the Kalat State have taken some little time, but I now enclose a copy of a letter from Edwards with enclosure, from which it will be seen that His Highness the Khan would not refuse to enter into discussions with the Sultan of Muscat on these matters. 3. There is no ’blockade* of Dwadur from the land side but only a perfectly legitimate gustoms Cordon. 4. The suggested compromise to which Edwards refers in his letter was to the effect that a joint duty on goods imported into Gwadur for consumption in the Kalat hinterland might be shared between the two Stated in an agreed proportion. 5. I do not myself however think that anything would come out of discussions between the two States, particularly now that it has been decided to transfer the flying boat base to Jiunri.

D. O.No.59-Con. (XLI-13/373 2. I enclose a coi3y of memorandum Mo.l7~S / No.17-3., dated the 6th April 1933, from the Wazir-i-Azam, Kalat State. Having so recently taken charge of this Agency I find it difficult as yet to offer any useful opinion on the questions at issu hut as His Highness is clearly prepared to enter inot dis cussions on the subject, I am inclined to think that the compromise outlined in paragraph 2 of your D.O. letter No. 431/P., of the 13th January 1938 might form a very suitable basis for discussion. The main difficulties in the way of a final solution appear to be the uncompromising attitude^ of the Sultan of Muscat on the one hand and on the other . the fact that the Kalat State, in their anxiety to attract trade to their own posts of Pasni and Jiunri, have little desire to give facilities which might encourage further trade through G-wadar. 3. On the information at present at my disposal, it does not appear to be true that the Kalat State authori ties have established any ^blockade' ont he Gwadar frontier Possibly the Sultan of Muscat was referring to the Kalat State customs cordon described in Gastrell’s D.0#No.368- (P.&amp; T. 14/36) of the 21st January 1938, which collects customs duty and transit fees on goods entering the Kalat State. 4. As to the encroachments referred to in paras 6 and 7 of the Wazir-i-Azam’s memorandum, I do not suggest that any representation need be made at present. I arn not yet-c- in a position to estimate to what extent his allegations are justified; and on p rima facie grounds it seems that the existence of the Kalat State customs cordon should in itself afford a sufficient safeguard against any manifest encroachment. In any case, if a general discussion is initiated on the compromise basis, the Kalat State authori ties would doubtless find an opportunity then to ensure that any final agreement contains an adequate safeguard against encorachment by the Sultan of Muscat beyond G-wadar limits. Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.Gr.N.Edwards. To Captain L.A.Gr.Pinhey, I.A., Secretary to the Agent to the G-ovemor- G-eneral m Baluchistan, Quetta. True Copy, Sd/- Illegible Superintendent, Baluchistan Secretariate. Copy of memorandum No.l7-S., dated the 6th April 1838 from the Wazir-i-Azam, Kalat State, Kalat, to the Political Agent, Kalat, Mastung. Subject:- G-wadur trade. Reference your telegram No.192 dated the 3rd April 1938 and our discussion dated the 4th instant on the above s ub j ec t. 2. The situation regarding G-wadur affairs is undoubte ly very peculiar of its kind. Originally G-wadur was a part of Mekran territory in the Kalat State. In the 13th centui i of Gwadur port was bestowed upon one of the ancestors of the present Sultan of Maskat for his maintenance by the then Khan of Kalat. The remaining i share had never— 6 . been gifted by the Grichkis of Mekran who still possess such gift Sanads in which the then Khan of Kalat wrote to the G-ichkis (ancestors of Nawab ]Jai Khan) that he had gifted 1 of his share of G-wadur port to so and so for their maintenance. It is an admitted fact that Gwadur is a giiued property from the ancestors of the present Khan of Kalat and the gift is strictly confined to the fort area of Gwadur. o* As regards the complaint made on his part regarding land customs that the Kalat State authorities are not allowing the traders to pass to Gwadur is devoid of facts. 4. The Kalat State has got at present two main Sea I-ortsPasni and Jiunri along the Mekran Coast. These ports are visited by traders from the following localities:* (1) . From Kech Side-pay customs at Karwat and Talang. (2) . Iranian traders coming via Fay customs at Mand and Tump. Suntsar. (3) Iranians border traders coming Pay customs at from Bahu side. ' Kalatak, Kuldan and Chatan. 5. It is in the interest of the traders from the above centres proceeding to Jiunri and Pasni that they are not charged any customs at the above mentioned posts, but when they proceed towards Gwadur a fair rate of customs is charged according to the old established rights. The majority of the traders in their own financial interest would naturally hesitate to proceed towards Gwadur where they have also to pay another customs to the W&amp;li of Gwadur besides the Kalat State dues; and therefore they prefer to go to Jiunri and Pasni rather than to Gwadur and return to their country by the same route. It is thus clear that the rights enjoyed by the Kalat State to levy land customs in her own territory are justified in every way and such right* could not be waived in favour of the Wali at Gwadur as a gifted property.6, I think personally the complaint made by the Wall against the Kalat State customs policy is only meant to conceal his activities which he is making in connection with the encroachment in the State territory. It is re ported to me by the Naib Wazir Mekran that the Wali is extending his influence along the Mekran coast and he has actually gone as far as Sur about 12 miles north east of Gwadur and then to Ran and Rarbeia along the coast while towards Kulanch about 30 miles in the interior of Kalat State and again towards our customs post at Suntsar about a distance of 3-4 miles from the post. Ee has started an encroachment gradually upon the State territory which will come to light very soon. In the light of circumstances, the Wali is an aggressor and the Eaiat State is an aggrieved party, who cannot tolerate to see his encroachment in the State area likewise. In spite of all this if he is anxious to discuss on the subject, the Xalat State is prepared to receive him or his representative. 7. As regards his encroachment, it is requested that the Wali of Owadur may kindly be asked to confine his activities to Q-wadur Port only, otherwise there is every likelihood of a trouble between his men and the State people on the border, and which we never desire.

Parsons is against definition of boundary but recognises that it will be necessary if Sultan grants oil concession for Gwadur. According to papers received from the India Office Sultan informed you in ijondon that because of obstacle of necessity for approval of Governne nt he had decided not to proceed with negotiations with Burma Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions. !e learn on the other hand that representative of formed* Company has been discussing Gwadur concession with Sultan at Bombay and it is stated that Sultan has suggested Company should send representative to Muscat in October to conclude agreement. Could you ascertain from Sultan what his intentions in the matter are so that we may know w r hether v^e ought to proceed with demarcation proposals.

I wrote back the same day and enquired the name of the Dafadar and also what the dafadar had actually done. No reply having been received from the Wali, I went to see him on 30.6.39 and enquired from him personally. He stated that the dafadar had not come to the town of Gwadur but that at a distance of about, 20 miles from th€ town the dafadar had interfered with the liberty of some caravan. The Wali also adaed that he had sent out his men to find out the name of the dafadar and that as soon as he had received further particulars about the incident he would inform me. 2. Now the Wali reports that Dafadar Qasam and Baiyan of Suntsar and Munshi Ghaus Bakhsh of Gabd stopped^near Fieri in Gwadur territory, a caravan coming from Mekran and recovered from them Es 6/- in the name of Customs duty.

Hickinbothamj C.B.E* y H.B.M* b Consul j Muscat. After Compliments. I have received infomation from Gwadur to the effect that the ofi icials of Kalat Government j who are on the frontier between Gwadur and Government of Kalat at a place named Sunt Sar, always cross the valley separating the two countries, and inspect the caravans there. As this action is against the regulations followed, I have to bring it to your notice for communication to our friend the Government of India with a view to stop it, so that there should not be any trouble between the officials of our Government at Gwadur and those of Kalat Government mentioned above. I am sure that the Government of India do not agree to the action the officials of Kalat Government are taking at Sunt Sar. Usual ending.I f ,,i H 4 •• ■ Copy of letter Ho. 8/701 dated the 1st July 1939 from British Agent, Gwadur to the Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consul, (®) Muscat* X have the honour to report that the Wall wrote to me on 27-6-39 that some Dafadar of Kalat State had pestered the caraelmen in Gwadur about four days previously and that I should write to the State Authorities to order their officials coming to Gwadur to refrain from interfering with the public here. I wrote back the same day and enquired the name of the Dafadar and also what the Dafadar had actually done. No reply having been received from the Wali, I went to see him on 30-6-39 and enquired from him personally. He stated that the Dafadar had not come to the town of Gwadur but that at a distance of about 20 miles from the town the Dafadar had interfered with the liberty of some caravan. The Wali also added that he had sent out his men to find out the name of the Dafadar and that as soon as he had received further particulars about the incident he would inform me 2. Now the Wali reports that Dafadar Qasam and Baiyan of Suntsar and Munshi Ghaus Bakhsh of Gabd stopped, near Pleri in Gwadur territory, a caravan coming from ^ekran and received from them Hs. 6/- in the name of Customs duty. Similarly Jemadar Nek Bakhsh who is incharge of motor road in Kalat State recovered, at Pleri in Gwadur territory, Hs. 5/- from a caravan coming from Mekran* 3. i doubt very much that anybody can prove the above- mbntioned outrages alleged to have been committed recently by the Kalat State Officials in Gwadur territory, but as the Kalat State Officials have behaved similarly on several occasions in the past, I do not consider the outrages now alleged, improbable. 4. In the circumstances, I would request you kindly to take what action you consider necessary in the matter. In my humble opinion if the Political Agent, Kalat could be requested to have the customs officials in Mekran instructed, to refrain from extending their activities into Gwadur territory, it shall meet the situation.G.T.C. - British Agent, Gwadur. - Political Agent, Muscat. - 728. - July the Itth, 1939.

The caravans in question returned to Iran long ago and therefore no information can be obtained from them till they happen to visit G-wadur again. 2.

Sir, I have the honour to quote below the Wall’s report for favour of suitable action in the matter. 'Tour Christians who are Engineers entered Guadur territory ; through Suntsar ; with cars, visited Saiji, Fishan, Fieri and Gurg and returned. They came again via Karwat where the track was not passable by cars. They therefore prepared the track and entered this territory, came upto Darbla and Gurandani, and returned. This is irregular. If they want to enter this territory and make any investigation, they should take permission from the Sultan otherwise I will not allow them to enter this territory. Kindly take up the matter with Kalat state and have them forbidden from entering this territory.” 2 . I understand that the four men in question are some American Geologists, they came by two cars, entered this territory, prepared the track wherever they found it impassable, went up the hills, looked round and returned. 1 also understand that they are stationed at Pasni. 3 . . The Wall objects especially to these people’s mak ing investigations and tempering with the soil of this territory for making motor track without permission.

He, however, telegraphed His Highness the Sultan and in consultation with his men made such arrangements as he possibly could with the men and material at his disposal, to guard the town. Great excitement prevailed in the town for two days. The Wali sent today the following message to me *1 now realise you were correct. There is really no truth in the report received by me. I have telegraphed the Sultan and am afraid he might come himself or send some men of Muscat Levy f and finding that my report was- 2 - wrong might get annoyed.

The Kalat State authorities are making enquiries into the various allegations of crossing of Gwadur boundary by the &amp; state officials, which will take some time involving inevitable delay.

Con fidential Sndorsemant No.C/458 dated the 24th September 1939 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) refer to the activities of the geologists of the Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. who were prospecting in the southern areas of Mekran and near the Gwadur boundary. His Highness the Khan of Kalat has now put a stop to all ground prospecting until his agreement with the Company has been finally signed, so for some moths at least it is unlikely that there will be any recurrence of this difficulty.

Sir, With reference to your No.C/284 dated 22.4.40, I have made enquiries and it transpires that the sepoys of the Mekran Levy stationed at Jiwani, have been paying visits to Peshkan occasionally. Some time ago two of them chased two girls who had gone out of the town of Peshkan to collect firewood. The girls ran and took shelter with a local man who happened to be somewhere near. The sepoys had the hardihood to go to the man and to threaten him to surrender the girls. The man refused and esconted the girls to their homes. 2. A local man reports that immediately before he left Peshkan yesterday, he saw one Jemadar accompanied of Mekran Levy by some Sepoys/and Dafadar of Ganz arrived there. 3. As regards the last portion of the Vali*s complaint regarding Kalat State officials’ interference with the liberty of caravans in this territory, I beg to state that I have had no confirmation of the report, and now that it is long since the caravans concerned left Guadur, it is not possible to get the report verified. In this connection I respectfully state that there is nothing improbable in the report as the Kalat state officials have behaved similarly in the past.

The British Agent reports a specific case in which two girls who hud gone out to collect f irewood were chased by sepoys; but who refused to give way to the escaped to the house of a man sepoy 6 ’ threats th.t he should surrender the girls (ii). That c iravans are blackmailed by Kalat officials. The «ali reports two c-ses, which the British agent are almost certainly genuine , against two mimed officials - (a). Abaul Rehmon, who took a quantity of wool from a caravan at Giruk, and ^ H (b). Sumar, who extorted two rupees from a caravan at Fieri. / 3. I2 3.

I have the honour to reproduce below English translation of Mali’s letter dated 21st Jamadi-ul-Akhar 1359 to my address, for whatever action you consider suitable in the matter. • H I inform you that son of Ahmad bin Barman went to Kech to purchase dates. There his camel was used for Begar (forced labour) and the Mustaufi of the place abused and imrisoned him. This is against QANUN. You . know how I treat the state people. You should address the Hakumat of that place and arrange that they do not do any thing against QANUN. If you do not take any action in the matter I will do just as as the officials of state do with my subjects. Take note.* I requested the Mali to send the son of Abmad so that I might enquire from him as to the details. Accordingly he * sent one Haibtan S/0 Abmad who, when questioned by me, stated, 'I accompanied by my brother named Soali went to Kech (Kalat state) . We had 3 camels. Our camels were siezed by the state officials for Begar and sent from Turbat to Nasirabad - distance of one Mans id. They promised to pay @ annas 2 14 per camel i.e. for 3 camels 3 2/10/-j instead of which they paid actually Re 1/3/- only. On our return from Nasirabad we purchased dated at Turbat anH when we were preparing to return to uuadur, the state officials wanted again to sieze our camels for Bqgar. We protested and stated that we were Muscat subjects and also that we had already been to Nasirabad on Begar. Thereupon we were taken to the Mastufi at0 X' 3 . lilt; effect that we had insulted and beaten the state officials. The Mastufi abused both of us and imrisoned my brother. When I told the Mastufi that I was a Muscat Subject, he was further enraged and abused my Hakumat also. My brother was released the same day in the evening and we returned to G-uadur. The name of the i^iastufi in question is Mohammad Umar. ” Unless I address the Yazir in Mekran, at Turbat, and find out as to what the Mastufi Mohammad Umar has to say in the matter, I cannot say how far the statement of Haibtan is correct. Kindly let me know if you approve of my addressing the Yazir in this connection. 4. The Yali seems to be under the impression that Muscat subjects, when they are out of Guadur territory, are not amenable to the law of the place in which they happen to be. Also in the last sentence of his letter he threatens to imitate the Kalat state officials(whom he himself considers Qanun breakers) and take action against British subjects. This means that he shall ignore when it pleases him that British subjects are not amenable to his court. May I explain to him that Muscat subjects are amenable to the law of the place in which they happen to be and that it would not be correct on his part to take any action against British subjects as they are not amenable to his court, even if that action may be in retaliation to any action of the Kalat state officials? In the meantime I am informing him that I have referred the matter to the authorities concerned for necessary action. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, British Agent.Bated the 14th August 1940 p.O.

In my opinion the version of the incident related by Dufiedar Qasim, Isa and 54x1 is very- much more probable than that related by the Muscat subjects. Of the latter, Jar do stated that he was attacked by seven men, who bound him and took away his camels. I find it difficult to place credence in the motive alleged for this attack, the necessity for making which is not apparent. It is, moreover, improbable that the Dufredar would so have endangered his own position by wantonly attacking, beating and binding subjects aua of another btate. 5.

Translation of vernacular report Nos 84., January, 194V, frou tbe Naib-Wasir, ^ekr?n 1. In this case Duffedar Qssia of the Customs Post at Gabd (20 miles North of Jiwani) is concerned. The said luffedar had proceeded cn leave from the 3sbd Post and spent the period of his leave at Turhat. After expiry of his leave he set out for Gabd in the company of a relative of his named Isa end of one of the Ggbd Levies named Musa. The Duffedar hired camels from Beki, a Cam el-driver, at Turbat. They left Turbat and reached Farekhin Tekh (about 8 miles from Turbat) where they saw some camels gracing. Seki told the Duffedar that his camels were weak and were unable to proceed further under lead and suggested that the camels which were gracing on the spot should be bewared for the carriage of his personal effects. The Duffedar agreed as he was under the impression that the camels in question belonged to K&amp;lat State subjects. The camels were at the moment unattended. His mrn accordingly brought the camels and, loading their kit on them, continued their journey. Afterfa short distance, they met owners of the camels, who were Baluchis end were three in numbers. They immediately cut the leading ropes of the camels, without any preliminary enquiry, and in addition proceeded to beat the Duffedar end his companions . Duringaffray, the Duffedar received injuries on his head. The party of the Duffedar was larger than that of the Baluchis and the Duffedar*s party accordingly succeeded in arresting the Baluchs and threatened to beat them. The said Baluchis replied that they were the men ef the Sultan of Muscat and showed their rehdaris to the Duffedar. The Duffedgr .asked them why they had not shown their ra h4.^ in the first instance and why they had beat* him without cause. The said Baluchs then requested the Duffedar to excuse them. After that they were released with their camels. M f g m It Xs evident from the above statement that the Duffedar and his companions are not to blame. The fault lay with the Muscat Baluchis. The Duffedar was unaware as to wh^m the owners ©f the camels were. A*s these camels were gj.c.zlng j.n the Turbat are© he therefore imagined them t® belong to Kalat State subjectsand begSE&amp;d them as in the custom in such cases if the need arises. The Baluchis ought to have informed the Duffedar that they were Muscat Subjects and that they had rphdarla in t^eir possession,but they took the law into their own hands and attacked the Duffeder* On defeat they showed their rahdaris to the Duff edar^ On ex-mining them, the said Duffedar set them free. It i s the Baluchis reported the occurrence to the Vvali of Gwcdur in the first instance owing to fear, thinking that th _ Buffedar would report them. It seems that they have made a false accusation against the Duffedar. 3 In addition to this I have personally spoken t© the Wall of Gwadur in this connection. I informed him that we had received one letter in Arabic end another in Persian to the address of the W&amp;sir-i-Azsm. The names cf the parties concerned were not mentioned in the abovo-m&amp;ntiened letters and it was not therefore possible to carry out .- complete investigation owing to the incompleteness of the letters, un receipt of a letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, through the Assistant Political Agent In Mekran, an investigplan In the case was carried out. From the investigation mad. it is OUK iLtScefiFMe hid SlEuflKo release their camels, they 't then t® have complained against the Duffedar to the ought thenw nave They did n0t d# without making ne&lt;! Preliminary enquiries, they attacked the Duffedar. The t^d D^fedar was a respectable efflclal. As he was insulted, he *c.£ therefore, compelled to beat the said Baluchis, notthen knowing that they were Muscat subjects. ^fterw?,rds they confessed their guilt# and eppologi&amp;ed to hin. I asked the »&gt;ali to instruct his people, y^hile giving them xuJadaxls, not to take the law into their 5/- hands in such instances and fight with Kal at State subjects, but t© show their rah-i^ris immediately and, in the unlikely event of their r^hd^-ri ■&gt; being disregarded, tu iaake an immediate report to the nearest Niabat or Post. I informed him also that I would issue the necessary instructions in the matter throughout Mekr&amp;n and that I had no fear of the' 1 repetition of such an occurrence in future. Dated S5.1.42. cd.

Much of the correspondence discusses longstanding British concerns that the boundary should be officially defined and demarcated before any valuable minerals are discovered in the area. A settlement of the boundary is initially suggested in May 1913 by the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan (Lieutenant-Colonel J Ramsay); the issue is raised again in May 1938, with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle) making the case for the establishment of a small boundary commission for the purpose of settling the frontier dispute.The volume includes discussion of the following: the Sultan of Muscat's concerns regarding a reported Trans-Persian railway survey near Gwadur in 1912; territorial disputes between the Gwadur and Mekran authorities; trade disputes between Kalat and Muscat (also spelled as Maskat and Masqat in the earlier correspondence); whether the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Limited should be permitted to negotiate with the Sultan of Muscat, in spite of the fact that the Sultan cannot grant an oil concession without the Government of India's approval; the likelihood of the Khan of Kelat being in favour of demarcation; travel arrangements and expenses for the proposed boundary commission; the alleged crossing of the Gwadur boundary by Kalat state officials; rumours of the Khan of Kalat's intentions to invade Gwadur; reported incidents between Muscat and Kalat subjects.The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan; the British Agent, Gwadur; the Sultan of Muscat; the Director of the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran; officials of the Government of India's External Affairs Department.Also included in the volume is a sketch map of Gwadur and the surrounding region. The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat. The file also includes a small amount of correspondence in Farsi.Whilst the volume includes material dating from 1912 to 1942, it should be noted that there is no material covering the period of 1920-1936.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Agent to the Governor-General, Resident and Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Mekran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section, Director</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kalat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gwadur</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Trade disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00037e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
