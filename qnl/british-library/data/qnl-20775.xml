Chiefs of the Arab Coast who are in Treaty relations wmi the British Government,—I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India of the British authority which you and your fathers and forefathers have known and dealt with for more than a hundred years; and my object is to show you that, though you live at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, but that they adhere to the policy of guardianship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of a century; and that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundred years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf ; almost every man was a marauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave-trading flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put out to sea without fear of attack; the pearl-fishery was a scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace[ 2 ] there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened, and said that, in the interest o£ its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe while it lasted, but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs and a ' perfect maritime truce'—to use the words that were employed—'for evermore'; that, in the event of aggressions on any one by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure, at all times, the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed but on the whole it has well deserved its name; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest anions you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven years since the last disturbance of the peace occurred.[ 3 ] Chiefs,ou of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Governme nt of India and yourselves, whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Goverament, and not to part with any portion o£ its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs, there is no fear that any one else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there are persons who ask why should Great Britain continue to exercise these powers ? The history of your States and of your families and the present condition of the Gulf are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modem times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours.[ 4 ] We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. We are not now going- to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained ; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Govern ment must remain supreme. There is one respect in which the Chiefs themselves can avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo ; for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his Treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that a certain portion of that strip of the Oman coast known as the Batineh, on the opposite side of the Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis. Nevertheless, his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and it is as his representa tive in India who is responsible to him for your welfare that I am here to-day to exchange greetings with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future.[ 5 ] Treaties and engagements in force on 1st January 1906 between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab Coast. [ N ots ,—In the event of doubt hereafter arising as to the precise interpretation of anj portion of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive.] General Treaty with the Arab Tribes of the Persian Gulf—1820. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise be to God, who hath ordained peace to be a blessing to his creatures. There is established a lasting peace between the British Government and the Arab tribes, who are parties, to this contract, on the following conditions :— Article 1. There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy by land , and sea on the part of the Arabs, who are parties to this contract, for ever. Article 2. If any individual of the people of the Arabs contracting shall attack any that pass by land or sea of any nation, whatsoever, in the way of plunder and piracy and not of acknowledged war, he shall be accounted an enemy of all mankind, and shall be held to have forfeited both life and goods. An acknowledged war is that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government; and the killing of men and taking of goods without procla mation, avowal, and the order of a Government is plunder and piracy. Article 3. The friendly (literally the pacificated) Arabs shall carry by land and sea a red flag, with or without letters in it, at their option, and this shall be in a border of white, the breadth of the white in the border being equal to the breadth of the red, as represented in the margin (the whole forming the flag known in the British Navy by the title of white pierced red); this shall be the flag of the friendly Arabs, and they shall use it, and no other. Article 4. The paciticated tribes shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government, and shall not fio-ht with each other, and the flag shall be a symbol of this onlv ami of nothing further. ' 5 '[ 6 ] Article 5. The vessels of the friendly Arabs shall all of them have in their possession a paper (Register) signed with the signa ture of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the vessel, its length, its breadth, and how many Karahs it holds. And they shall also have in their possession another writing (Port Clearance) signed with the signature of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the owner, the name of the Nacodah, the number of men, the number of arms, from whence sailed, at what time, and to what port bound. And if a British or other vessel meet them, they shall produce the Register and the Clearance. Article 6. The friendly Arabs, if they choose, shall send an Envoy to the British Residency in the Persian Gulf with the necessary accompaniments, and he shall remain there for the transaction of their business with the Residency; and the British Government, if it chooses, shall send an Envoy also to them in like manner; and the Envoy shall add his signature to the signature of the Chief in the paper (Register) of their vessels, which contains the length of the vessel, its breadth, and tonnage; the signature of the Envoy to be renewed every year. Also all such Envoys shall be at the expense of their own party. Article 7. If any tribe, or others, shall not desist from plunder and piracy, the friendly Arabs shall act against them according to their ability and circumstances, and an arrangement for this purpose shall take place between the friendly Arabs and the British at the time w T hen such plunder and piracy shall occur. Article 8. The putting men to death after they have given up their arms is an act of piracy, and not of acknowledged war ; and if any tribe shall put to death any persons, either Mubammadans or others, after they have given up their arms, such tribe shall be held to have broken the peace; and the friendly Arabs shall act against them in conjunction with the British, and, God willing, the war against them shall not cease until the surrender of those who performed the act and of those who ordered it.[ 7 ] A rticle 9. The carrying off of slaves, men, women, or children, from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature. Article 10. The vessels of the friendly Arabs, bearing their flag above described, shall enter into all the British ports and into the ports of the allies of the British so far as they shall be able to effect it; and they shall buy and sell therein, and if any shall attack them, the British Government shall take notice of it. Article 11. These conditions aforesaid shall be common to all tribes and persons, who shall hereafter adhere thereto in the same manner as to those who adhere to them at the time present.

Preliminary. Since it is to the interest of all the Trucial Chiefs to combine mutually for the prevention of their subjects absconding for fraud from one territory and taking asylum in another especially as regards divers and sailors.

Chiefs of the Arab Coast who are in Treaty relations witn the British Government,—I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India of the British authority which you and your fathers and forefathers have known and dealt with for more than a hundred years; and my object is to show you that, though you live at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, but that they adhere to the policy of guardianship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of a century; and that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundred years ago there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf ; almost every man was a marauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave-trading flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put out to sea without fear of attack; the pearl-fishery was a scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace[ 2 ] there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened, and said that, in the interest of its own subjects and traders, and o£ its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe while it lasted, but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Trace was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs and a ' perfect maritime truce'—to use the words that were employed—'for evermore'; that, in the event of aggressions on any one by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure, at all times, the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed but on the whole it has well deserved its name; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest amony; you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven years since the last disturbance of the peace occurred.[ 3 ] Chiefs,ou of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian o£ inter-tribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Governraen t f India and yourselves, whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Goverament, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs, there is no fear that any one else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there are persons who ask why should Great Britain continue to exercise these powers ? The history of your States and of your families and the present condition of the Gulf are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modern times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours.[ 4 ] We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your iudependence, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Govern ment must remain supreme. There is one respect in which the Chiefs themselves can avert any renewal of trouHe in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo ; for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his Treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that a certain portion of that strip of the Oman coast known as the Batineh, on the opposite side of the Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis. Nevertheless, his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and it is as his representa tive in India who is responsible to him for your welfare that I am here to-day to exchange greetings with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future.[ 5 ] Treaties and engagements in force on 1st January 1906 between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab Coast. [ N otb .—Tn the event of doubt hereafter arising: as to the precise interpretation of any portion of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive.] General Treaty with the Arab Tribes of the Persian Gulf—1820. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise be to God, who hath ordained peace to be a blessing to his creatures. There is established a lasting peace between the British Government and the Arab tribes, who are parties, to this contract, on the following conditions :— Article 1. There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy by land and sea on the part of the Arabs, who are parties to this contract, for ever. Article 2. If any individual of the people of the Arabs contracting shall attack any that pass by land or sea of any nation, whatsoever, in the way of plunder and piracy and not of acknowledged war, he shall be accounted an enemy of all mankind, and shall be held to have forfeited both life and goods. An acknowledged war is that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government; and the killing of men and taking of goods without procla mation, avowal, and the order of a Government is plunder and piracy. Article 3. The friendly (literally the pacificated) Arabs shall carry by land and sea a red flag, with or without letters in it, at their option, and this shall be in a border of white, the breadth of the white in the border being equal to the breadth of the red, as represented in the margin (the whole forming the flag known in the British Navy by the title of white pierced red); this shall be the flag of the friendly Arabs, and they shall use it, and no other. Article 4. The pacificated tribes shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government, and shall not fio-ht w ith each other, and the flag shall be a symbol of this onlv and of nothing further. ' 'v [ 6 ] Article 5. The vessels of the friendly Arabs shall all of them have in their possession a paper (Register) signed with the signa ture of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the vessel, its length, its breadth, and how many Karahs it holds. And they shall also have in their possession another writing (Port Clearance) signed with the signature of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the owner, the name of the Nacodah, the number of men, the number of arms, from whence sailed, at what time, and to what port bound. And if a British or other vessel meet them, they shall produce the Register and the Clearance. Article 6. The friendly Arabs, if they choose, shall send an Envoy to the British Residency in the Persian Gulf with the necessary accompaniments, and he shall remain there for the transaction of their business with the Residency; and the British Government, if it chooses, shall send an Envoy also to them in like manner; and the Envoy shall add his signature to the signature of the Chief in the paper (Register) of their vessels, which contains the length of the vessel, its breadth, and tonnage; the signature of the Envoy to be renewed every year. Also all such Envoys shall be at the expense of their own party. Article 7. If any tribe, or others, shall not desist from plunder and piracy, the friendly Arabs shall act against them according to their ability and circumstances, and an arrangement for this purpose shall take place between the friendly Arabs and the British at the time when such plunder and piracy shall occur. Article 8. The putting men to death after they have given up their arms is an act of piracy, and not of acknowledged war; and if any tribe shall put to death any persons, either Muhammadans or others, after they have given up their arms, such tribe shall be held to have broken the peace; and the friendly Arabs shall act against them in conjunction with the British, and, God willing, the war against them shall not cease until the surrender of those who performed the act and of those who ordered it.[ 7 ] Article 9. The carrying off of slaves, men, women, or cliildren, from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature. Article 10. The vessels of the friendly Arabs, bearing their flag above described, shall enter into all the British ports and into the ports of the allies of the British so far as they shall be able to effect it; and they shall buy and sell therein, and if any shall attack them, the British Government shall take notice of it. Article 11. These conditions aforesaid shall be common to all tribes and persons, who shall hereafter adhere thereto in the same manner as to those who adhere to them at the time present.

And in the event (which God forbid) of any of our subjects or dependents committing an act of aggression or trespass on the said telegraphic lines and stations or other telegraphic material, we will immediately punish the offender and proceed to afford full redress upon the same being brought to our notice.

Preliminary. Since it is to the interest of all the Trucial Chiefs to combine mutually for the prevention of their subjects absconding for fraud from one territory and taking asylum in another especially as regards divers and sailors. On this account we, whose seals and signatures are attached to this document, hereby agree and bind ourselves in the presence of Haji Abul Cassim, Residency Munshi, specially deputed for giving effect to this object, and Haji Abdur Rahman, Government Agent, to give aid in every way possible in preventing such runaways from obtaining aid or asylum in our countries. Therefore, in accordance with this agreement, we consent— 1st, —In the event of a runaway seeking refuge in our territories, whether by sea or land, to consider it our duty to at once restore him to the Chief from whose jurisdiction he may have absconded. 2nd. —In the event of its being proved that a runaway is protected by any Chief, and not delivered up, or his li ability accepted when demanded by the Government Agent,[ 18 ] such Chief shall be liable to a fine of 50 dollars in addition to all just claims proven against such runaway. Srd' rurther, if the Chief harbouring such runaway refuse to deliver him up, or accept his liability when demanded by the Government Agent, and permit him to proceed to the pearl banks in pursuance of his vocation, such Chief shall be liable to a fine of 100 dollars in addition to all just proven claims against the runaway. TVhen facts are disputed, a council of arbitration (mejlis) will be convened, at which the Government Agent will preside, the disputing parties and all the Trucial Chiefs sending delegates, or if they wish, attending themselves.

Chiefs of the Arab Coast who are in Treaty relations with the British Government,-—I have come here as the representative in the great Empire of India o£ the British authority which you and your fathers and forefathers have known and dealt with for moie thiin a hundred years j and my object is to show you that, though } ou li\ c at some distance from the shores of India, you are not forgotten by the Government, but that they adhere to the policy of guardianship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your righ^ for the best part of a century; and that the first Viceroy of India who has ever visited these waters does not quit them without seeking the opportunity of meeting you in person and of renewing the assurances and engagements by which we have been so long united. Chiefs, your fathers and grandfathers before you have doubtless told you of the history of the past. You know that a hundred years ao&gt;o there were constant trouble and fighting in the Gulf ; almost every o man was a marauder or a pirate; kidnapping and slave-trading flourished; fighting and bloodshed went on without stint or respite; no ship could put out to sea without fear of attack; the pearl-fishei &gt; was a scene of annual conflict; and security of trade or peace[ 2 ] there was none. Then it was that the British Government intervened, and said that, in the interest of its own subjects and traders, and of its legitimate influence in the seas that wash the Indian coasts, this state of affairs must not continue. British flotillas appeared in these waters. British forces occupied the ports and towns on the coast that we see from this deck. The struggle was severe while it lasted, but it was not long sustained. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs; and of these or similar agreements there have been in all no fewer than eiffht. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace that has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs and a ' perfect maritime truce'—to use the words that were employed—'for evermore'; that, in the event of aggressions on any one by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure, at all times, the observance of the Treaty. Chiefs, that Treaty has not, of course, prevented occasional trouble and conflict; it has sometimes been neglected or infringed but on the whole it has well deserved its name; and under it has grown up a condition of affairs so peaceful and secure that the oldest amonu- you can only remember as a dim story the events of the past, while the younger have never seen warfare or bloodshed on the seas. It is now eleven years since the last disturbance of the peace occurred.[ 3 3 Chiefs,ou of the relations that were thus created, and which by your own consent constituted the British Government the guardian of mter-tnbal peace, there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves, whereby the British Govercment became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has bound itself, as you know, not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the agent of any other Government, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements ■ire binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs, there is no fear that any one else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of Icing forgotten, and there are persons who ask why should Great Britain continue to exercise these powers ? The history of your States and of your families and the present condition of the Gulf are the answer. We were here before any other Power, in modem times, had shown its face in these waters. We found strife and we have created order. It was our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Kmpire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours.[ 4 ] We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained ; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Govern ment must remain supreme. There is one respect in which the Chiefs themselves can avert any renewal of trouble in the future. The British Government have no desire to interfere, and have never interfered, in your internal affairs, provided that the Chiefs govern their territories with justice, and respect the rights of the foreign traders residing therein. If any internal disputes occur, you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has frequently done in the past, to prevent these dissensions from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo ; for we could not approve of one independent Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his Treaty obligations. I will mention a case that seems to lend itself to friendly settlement of the character that I have described. You are all of you aware that a certain portion of that strip of the Oman coast known as the Batineh, on the opposite side of the Oman Peninsula, is under the authority of the Chief of the Jowasmis, Nevertheless, his authority is contested in some quarters. It is desirable that these disputes should cease, and that the peace should remain undisturbed. Chiefs, these are the relations that subsist between the British Government and yourselves. The Sovereign of the British Empire lives so far away that none of you has ever seen or will ever see his face; but his orders are carried out everywhere throughout his vast dominions by the officers of his Government, and il is as his representa tive in India who is responsible to him for your welfare that I am here to-day to exchange greetings with you, to renew old assurances, and to wish you prosperity in the future.[ 5 ] Treaties and engagements in force on 1st January 1908 between the British Government and the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab Coast. [Notb .—In the event of doubt hereafter arising as to the precise interpretation of any portion of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipulations, the English text shall be considered decisive.] G-eneral Treaty with the Arab Tribes of the Persian Gulf—1820. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Praise be to God, who hath ordained peace to be a blessing to his creatures. There is established a lasting peace between the British Government and the Arab tribes, who are parties, to this contract, on the following conditions :— Article 1. There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy by land and sea on the part of the Arabs, who are parties to this contract, for ever. Article 2. If any individual of the people of the Arabs contracting shall attack any that pass by land or sea of any nation, whatsoever, in the way of plunder and piracy and not of acknowledged war, he shall be accounted an enemy of all mankind, and shall be held to have forfeited both life and goods. An acknowledged war is that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government; and the killing of men and taking of goods without procla mation, avowal, and the order of a Government is plunder and piracy. Article 3. The friendly (literally the pacificated) Arabs shall carry by land and sea a red flag, with or without letters in it, at their option, and this shall be in a border of white, the breadth of the white in the border being equal to the breadth of the red, as represented in the margin (the whole forming the flag known in the British Navy by the title of white pierced red); this shall be the flag of the friendlv Arabs, and they shall use it, and no other. Article 4. ihe pacificated tribes shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government, and shall not fio-ht with each other, and the flag shall be a symbol of this onlv and of nothing further.[ 6 ] Akticle 5. The vessels of the friendly Arabs shall all of them have in their possession a paper (Register) signed with the signa ture of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the vessel, its length, its breadth, and how many Karahs it holds. And they shall also have in their possession another writing (Port Clearance) signed with the signature of their Chief, in which shall be the name of the owner, the name of the Nacodah, the number of men, the number of arms, from whence sailed, at what time, and to what port bound. And if a British or other vessel meet them, they shall produce the Register and the Clearance. Article 6. The friendly Arabs, if they choose, shall send an Envoy to the British Residency in the Persian Gulf with the necessary accompaniments, and he shall remain there for the transaction of their business with the Residency; and the British Government, if it chooses, shall send an Envoy also to them in like manner; and the Envoy shall add his signature to the signature of the Chief in the paper (Register) of their vessels, which contains the length of the vessel, its breadth, and tonnage; the signature of the Envoy to be renewed every year. Also all such Envoys shall be at the expense of their own party. Article 7. If any tribe, or others, shall not desist from plunder and piracy, the friendly Arabs shall act against them according to their ability and circumstances, and an arrangement for this purpose shall take place between the friendly Arabs and the British at the time when such plunder and piracy shall occur. Article 8. The putting men to death after they have given up their arms is an act of piracy, and not of acknowledged war ; and if any tribe shall put to death any persons, either Muhammadans or others, after they have given up their arms, such tribe shall be held to have broken the peace; and the friendly Arabs shall act against them in conjunction with the British, and, God willing, the war against them shall not cease until the surrender of those who performed the act and of those who ordered it.[ 1 Article 9. The carrying off of slaves, men, women, or children, from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature. Article 10. The vessels of the friendly Arabs, bearing their flag above described, shall enter into all the British ports and into the ports of the allies of the British so far as they shall be able to effect it; and they shall buy and sell therein, and if any shall attack them, the British Government shall take notice of it. Article 11. These conditions aforesaid shall be common to all tribes and persons, who shall hereafter adhere thereto in the same manner as to those who adhere to them at the time present.
