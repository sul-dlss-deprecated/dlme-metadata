This report has been compiled at short notice, on such information as was available at the time, to meet the demand for a volume of practical use giving this information in a handy form. Furthermore, the area under survey has been within hostile territory since the time Turkey entered the Great War, consequently detailed information concerning it has been, and still is, consistently hard to obtain. It, therefore, doubtless contains numerous errors both of omission and commission. It is hoped that all such will be pointed out freely with a view to the production of a revised edition at an early date. General Staff, British Forces in Iraq, July 192?.

Generals —Western Kurdistan has since the beginning of historical times constituted a land-bridge along which the powers of east and west have Hung their armies in essavs at imperial expansion. It has never formed a complete political unit by itself. In consequence its history consists of a series of incidents in the larger histories of the various powers, which have occupied it throughout the centuries, and is only regional, in so lar as the actual natives of Western Kurdistan have been in rebellion against such powers. Its past is somewhat mistily described in the annals of the Arab historians, the books of travellers and Turkish administrative reports. The legendary lore of the Kurdish tribes is of psychological rather than of historical value. Ancient.— The clash of opposing civilizations has naturally thrown into Western Kurdistan a medley of dissimilar races and institutions, but the predominant and most numerous population is Kurdish. It has now been satisfactorily established that the Kurds are of an Aryan stock, which settled temporarily after one of the great Aryan migratory periods in Azerbaijan, and gradually* pushed their way westward between the lakes of Urmia and Van on the headwaters of the Tigiis and Euphrates. In this, as in other districts where they have settled, the Kurds, thanks perhaps to some talent for survival inherent in the race, have contrived after semi-absorption in the empires of Assyria, Medea, Macedonia, Persia, Rome, and Turkey, not only to main tain a savage sort of independence, but to keep their racial and social characteristics immune from foreign influence. Another large and important element in the population was the Armenians, who seem to have been early inhabi tants of Western Kurdistan where they first became a united nation under Haig. Immediately before the Christian era, a certain King, Dikran by name, fen men an Armenian State round the city of Diarbekr, which is said to have taken its name from him. Armenia’s enjoy ment of independence ■was shortlived and was irretrievably lost in the struggle between Parthia and (C2242) ^2 Rome. From these far-off days Armenia has striven hardily for her lost nationhood, but she has never gained anything more concrete than her present position. During the seventh and eighth centuries the Amirs of Arabia, inflated with their successes in Syria and Lower Iraq, pushed their conquering arms into the Kurdish hills. The latter they were never able to hold, while the Kurdish population of the plains, retiring into the mountain fastnesses, escaped Arab bondage, but carried with them the more bitter thraldom of Muhammad’s creed. From the eighth century the Kurds adopted Islamism as their national, or rather, racial religion. About a.d. 1000 the Seljuk Turks occupied Mesopotamia and such portions (the lowlands) of Western Kurdistan as were then in Arab hands. Two centuries later, the savage hordes of Mongol Tartars swept westward and in their harrowing marches blotted out the last vestiges of Arab civilization in Western Kurdistan, but left the Kurdish population to its seclusion and new religion. In the middle of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Turks took nominal possession of Kurdistan, which has remained in their hands ever since. Except along the Black Sea littoral, the Turkish invaders did not remain as settlers, but swent straight on towards the Bosphorus and the coffers of Europe. Modern .—The last fifty years in Western Kurdistan have been marked by efforts to secure the elimination of the local Armenian population and the establishment on a stronger basis of government control in the whole area. The Turks have always, somewhat erroneously, sus pected the Armenians of disloyalty to the Ottoman Oovernment, and that their political ideas tended to favour the advance of Russian power in Anatolia. The Armenians, though undoubtedly chafing under many grievances, have, on the other hand, manifested an impolitic attitude of moral and intellectual superiority over the Turks, who could only view such an attitude with resentment. In consequence the Turks, whose com parative savagery is too well known to require further comment, had recourse in their solution of the Armenian problem, to the barbaric methods of their Mongol ancestors—-murder and deportation. In 1888, a sei ions anti-Armenian outbreak took place in Kharput and Mush, while in 1896 occurred a massacre on a gigantic scale in which some 300,000 Armenians were butchered. The Great Powers, owing to jealousy and suspicion ofr f ? 3 each other’s motives, were only able in the ensuing years to restrain the Turks from open murder and rape. After the outbreak of war the Ottoman authorities, inspired by those eminent apostles of liberty, Talaat and Enver Pasha, considered the occasion uniquely opportune for the elimination of both the Armenian problem and race. An order was therefore issued that the whole Armenian population was to be deported from Anatolia to Syria, Mosul and Deir ez Zor. The deportations were carried out with characteristic Turkish bloodshed; thousands of men, women, and children were murdered in Kharput, Mush and Diarbekr; women were raped, violated and sent to Turkish harems; and now r , of a large Armenian popu lation, all that remain are a few families round Diarbekr and a few score in the larger towns. The tide of Arab conquest, which in the eighth century reached the Kurdish hills, withdrew and again flowed into Western Kurdistan wdth the Shammar conquests, has of late years perceptibly receded. The Shammar Jarba at one time swept the country-side as far as Urfah, Mardin and Nisibin, wdiile the sedentary Kurds of these regions were in danger of being pushed into the mountains to the north. Eventually, however, the Milli, under the able leadership of Ibrahim Pasha and aided by contingents of the Anizah and Shammar Jarba, were able to thrust the Shammar from their territories. The establishment of strong Turkish garrisons in Nisibin, Mardin and Urfah also has tended to keep Arab depredations at a minimum. It is a curious reflection on the intricacies of tribal politics that the tendency now is for the Milli, Shammar Jarba and Tai to unite against the aggression of the Anizah. The establishment of garrisons in the larger towns was a measure calculated to bring Western Kurdistan under better governmental control, but it was found that, while this obtained in the towns, there was no appreciable difference on the lawlessness of the tribes. The late Sultan Abdul Hamid, therefore, in order to deal with this problem, and more especially to utilise the large numbers of armed mounted men possessed by Kurdish and Arab confederations, instituted the Hamidieh cavalry. In all, sixty-six regiments w^ere raised. Each tribe, if it wished to adopt the scheme, was allowed to raise one or more regiments, according to its strength. For example, the Milli raised three regiments which formed a brigade under Ibrahim Pasha. The chief features in the organization was that the Hamidieh units (C2242) B -4 remained tribal. They were officered by their own chiefs, who were given Turkish military rank corresponding to the number of men they controlled. Beyond the induce ments of the grant of titles and army rank to tribal chiefs, other privileges were conferred by the Turks. These included a certain amount of license in the shape of looting other tribes, while any Hamidieh tribe was always sure of government support in its disputes with a tribe which furnished no irregular cavalry. The effect of this system was to form in Western Kurdistan a cordon along the Aleppo-Diarbekr-Bitlis route of tribes who would possibly be faithful to government and ensure the safety of communications between the Mediterranean and the East. Furthermore, the Hamidieh tribes were played off one against the other; petty jealousies between chiefs were fostered; while the danger of a strong Kurdish tribal confederation was obviated. Immediately after the Revolution of 1908, Ibrahim Pasha, disillusionised in the promises and hopes held out by the Young Turks, attempted to break away from the new government and form a small autonomous state. The attempt failed: Ibrahim was thrown into Diarbekr prison, and the prestige of the authorities grew in proportion. During the war 1914-1918, despite a violently-preached jihad, the tribes of Western Kurdistan only furnished small mounted contingents to the Turkish forces. The Milli raised 1,000 horsemen for service in Russia, but they never even received their arms. The effects of the war were badly felt in Western Kurdistan. The popu lation was reduced to half its former numbers and the area under cultivation dwindled to two-thirds of the pre-war area. There was, following the Russian advance in 1916, a certain inflow of refugees from Van and Bitlis, but these have nearly all returned to their former dwelling-places. The supply of arms was enormously increased, and the whole tribal population as a result is now well equipped with modern rifles and ammunition. In 1919 the Turkish Nationalists made strenuous efforts to gather the Kurdish tribes to their support, and to this end adopted the following methods: — (i) Removal of chiefs hostile to government. (ii) Conciliation of doubtful or friendly chiefs. (iii) Recruitment of townsmen and tribesmen in a loose _ military organisation known as ihe Milice, ,, i.e.y militia.5 Little success followed the Nationalist essay, and it is worthy of note that the removal of hostile chiefs has never been accomplished by military means alone. Political intrigue, jealousy and greed have been more efficacious weapons than regular troops, a fact amply borne out by the history of Ali Batti. Ali Batti, the paramount chief of the Haverki Kurds, had gained a widespread reputation as a brigand, who had even forced the town of Nisibin to pay towards the upkeep of his band. He became such a terror on the roads round Nisibin and Mardin that the military authorities were forced to take action. In order to deal w'ith Ali Batti s stronghold in the Jabal Tur, a force con sisting of one battalion from Midiat, one battalion from Nisibin, and gendarmes from Jazirah ibn Omar was concentrated in the Jabal Tur, and, though seemingly successful in overcoming Ali Batti’s resistance, were unable to administer the coup de grace to that elusive brigand. The Haverki chief remained at large until the Turks released Hajo, tribesman of Ali Batti and a chief of the Haverki, from prison on condition that he removed Ali Batti. Eventually the latter was murdered by Hajo. The actual expedition against the Haverki lost a negli gible number of lives, but the difficulties of regular troops operating against the Kurds in the Kurdish hills was clearly shown. The country could be occupied, but it was impossible to maintain the troops in it for more than a short period, while the rebel chief remained at large and gained greatly in prestige with the departure of the troops. As a whole the Kurdish tribes have shown no great desire to help the Nationalists. There have been numerous small risings in the area, particularly of the Haverki and Milli. The denudation of the Nisibin-Mardin area of regular troops in order to reinforce, firstly, the French and, latterly, the Greek fronts, induced the Milli to throw' in their lot with the French. They murdered the Turkish authorities in Veranshehr and only retired before a large military force into French territories. They continued raids into their former habitat and on one occasion inflicted a severe defeat on the Nationalist forces, capturing two guns. Western Kurdistan is of peculiar interest to the government of Iraq, since it is from this area that the emissaries of Turkish pan-Islamism have made their way to the tribes of Iraq, and because it is from Western Kurdistan that any movement on Mosul would be likely6 to take place. When the Allies failed to realise in 1919 the elasticity of the Nationalist demands as laid down in the Erzerum manifesto, the Nationalists immediately began to inaugurate a bitter anti-British policy in Western Kurdistan. By some means or other the Kurdish Nationalists, who had formerly betrayed sympathy with the possible British occupation of Kurdistan, were won over to the Turkish side. In pursuance of their violent anti-British crusade the Nationalists removed Jevdat Bey, Officer Commanding the 13th Army Corps, and Ali Bey, Officer Commanding 2nd Division, from their commands and put in their places Nihad Pasha and Akif Bey, who were known to have no Arab and strong anti-British sympathies. These two initiated a wide campaign of propaganda on the northern frontier of Iraq, circulariz ing and presenting with arms the Shammar, Tai, Juhaish and Tel Afaris. The Sherifian advance on Tel Afar in 1920 came as a blow to the Turks and their propaganda cooled down. After the Sherifian failure at Tel Afar it revived again under the aegis of Ajaimi al Sadun and latterly of Ahmad al Senussi. Ajaimi worked from Mardin until the middle of 1921, but evidently quarrelled with the Turks and was thought to be meditating a return to Iraq. Ahmad al Senussi arrived in Diarbekr about January, 1921, and, though his religious prestige is great even among the Iraq tribes, he was unable to accomplish any great pro-Turkish movement amongst them. In 1921 the Nationalists, who had before favoured any Arab risings in Iraq in order to exploit them at a later date, were chagrined to find the British policy of an Arab King for Iraq widely popular. They, therefore, adopted the idea of establishing a Turkish Prince, Burhan al Din, on the throne of Iraq. This idea they widely propagandized amongst the frontier tribes and in Baghdad and Mosul. It found readiest sympathy amongst ex-Turkish officials and the Turcoman population in Tel Afar and Kirkuk districts. In the spring of 1922 the situation in Western Kurdistan does not indicate any possible Turkish move on Mosul. The Kurdish tribes contrive to do much as they like; * the Milli are in open revolt; the Shammar and Tai are indifferent to any form of government, and the Turkish forces have been reduced to a minimum in order to ease the situation in Western Anatolia. The Nationalist energies are, therefore, confined to propaganda amongst the frontier tribes, and, propaganda without military forces to back it is unlikely to meet with much success.By the treaty of Sevres a small part of Western Kurdistan was put under the mandate of France, but that power has never been able to take over its responsibilities owing to the hostility of the Nationalists. At one time it seemed possible that Western Kurdistan might form part of an independent Kurdistan guaranteed by the great powers. This idea appears to have lapsed, and, although certain educated Kurdish chiefs continue to cherish dreams of independence, it is unlikely that they will gain this unless they take the necessary step of defeating and driving the Turkish forces from Western Kurdistan. The future' of that area, therefore, has still to be settled. CHAPTER II. GEOGRAPHY. Boundaries .—The area under report is bounded on the North by the Murad River flowing west from a point immediately north of Mush; West by the Euphrates flowing south as far as Birejik; South by an imaginary line running from Birejik- Urfah-Ras al Ain-Nisibin-Wadi Suwaidiyah to the River Tigris; East by a line drawn from Mush to the source of the Batman River, and thence along the left bank of the Batman River, and also of the Tigris down the junction of the Wadi Suwaidiyah and River Tigris. Note .—The town of Mosul is excluded from the area; other towns on the bounding lines are included. The area enclosed by the above boundaries consists of approximately 19,000 square miles, and embraces the whole of the Diarbekr Vilayet, together with portions of the Vilayets of Kharput, Aleppo and Bitlis. General .—Within this area every variety of climate is to be found. This is on account of the great contrast to be found between the hills of Kurdistan in the north and the plains of Iraq in the south. North of a line passing through Urfah-Diarbekr-Mosul, the country is uniformly mountainous. Where plains do exist, as, for example, around Mush, they are at such a high altitude8 and so broken by mountain ranges as to possess a climate usually associated solely with mountainous districts. South of this line extends the great Iraq plain, broken only occasionally by comparatively low hills, as, for example, the hills of Hardin and the Sinjar country. The Northern Iraq plain is, roughly, between 900 and 1.000 feet above sea-level. The highlands north of Diarbekr vary from 2,000 to 5,000 feet in height. The highest point included is the Ziaret Dagh, south-west of the Geuljik Lake, but there is no other peak to compare with this in altitude. The whole of this region is drained by the Tigris and Euphrates, and by the numerous mountain streams which go to swell these great rivers near their sources. The whole of this water passes to the sea by a single mouth— at Fao. Mountains. —The northern portion of Western Kurdistan is traversed by a lofty mountain chain, which rises up out of the Mush plain, and stretches away west ward until it culminates in the Ziaret Dagh, a peak over 7.000 feet high. This chain is crossed by the main road from Diarbekr to Kharput near Arghana Maden, where there is a break in the mountains. The road is metalled and is passable for all arms. The Murad River flows through the valley lying to the north of this range; then, after its junction with the Euphrates, turns away westward, only to retrace its course and wash the foot of the Ziaret Dagh. The metalled road from Diarbekr to Bitlis passes south of the above-mentioned range, and, until it crosses over to the left bank of the Batman River, traverses no high ground. In the southern portion of the area, the south-west corner is occupied by the Iraq plain, and no points over 2.000 feet are met with. The same applies to the south east corner which lies between Mosul and Nisibin. ►South-west of Diarbekr, a solitary commanding peak called the Karajah Dagh attains a height of over 6,000 feet. This peak is said to be of volcanic origin. It is important from the position which it occupies just south of the Diarbekr-Severek-Aleppo road. South-east of Diarbekr is an expanse of country broken up by hills of from 2,000 to 3,500 feet high. Mardin is built on the summit of one of these hills, from which a perfect view can be obtained over the Mesopotamian plain. Midiat is built in the heart of this broken country,9 uml although none of these hills reach 4,000 feet, yet their effect upon communications is so bad that tracks are impossible for wheeled vehicles to Midiat. These hills attain their greatest height near Hasan Kaif on the left bank of the Tigris. South of Midiat, between Mardin and Jazirah, this broken country is generally designated the Tur Abdin, or Jabal Tur. Rivers .—The whole of Western Kurdistan, as indeed the whole of Kurdistan and Iraq, is drained by the Tigris and the Euphrates and their tributaries. All the important tributaries of both rivers join the main streams on the left bank. (a) The Tigris System .—The Tigris has its source north of Diarbekr near Lake Geuljik, hut speedily becomes swollen by various mountain streams flowing down from the hills lying to the north-east. At Diarbekr during the low water season the river sometimes consists of nothing more than a series of pools connected by a narrow channel, but it is safer to reckon on finding a channel 80 yards wide even during the months of August and September. In the flood season during March and April the Tigris here rises 8 feet and is from 400 to 500 yards wide. From Diarbekr to the junction with the Batman Biver, which often contains as much water as the parent stream and has even been dignified by the name of the Eastern Branch of the Tigris, the river flows over a wide shingly bed; after the junction its course lies in a narrow deep channel between high cliffs. There are no rocks in the fairway to impede navigation. The Hazo and Bitlis Rivers are also important tributaries flowing in on the left bank. At Til the Bohtan River enters the Tigris. The valley becomes more open, the channel wider and the current more sluggish. The bed still consists of sand and shingle. At Jazirah ibn Omar the river emerges into open undulating country. The stream is 140 yards wide and in places 10 to 15 feet deep in July. The total width in spring flood, when it rises 8 feet above the July level, is from 400 to 500 yards. At that time the current flows 3,\ miles an hour, but is much less rapid at other seasons of the year. The bed below Jazirah ibn Omar remains of the same character throughout. A main channel 100 to 150 yards wide wanders over a bed of shingle 600 to 800 yards broad, which is only completely covered in flood time.JO The Khabur itiver, flowing through Zakho, joins the Tigris near Faish-Khabur. Throughout its entire course the Tigris provides an un limited supply of drinking water. In the vicinity of large towns the water is much polluted by tanning opera tions performed on kellek skins, and, unless special precautions are taken, watering-places should invariably be selected upstream. Above Diarbekr there is little navigation, and then only in the flood season. There are no craft available with the exception of small kelleks. Between Diarbekr and Mosul kelleks are freely used at all seasons of the year. For ferry purposes heavily-built pontoons are used. Many of these boats are capable of carrying an A.T. cart complete. Power-propelled craft are not employed, though there is no reason why heavily-engined shallow draft launches should not be used to tow rafts upstream from Mosul. (See Communications, Chapter VIII.) The only tributaries of the Tigris, which fall within the scope of this report, are the Dibene and the Batman Rivers. These both join the parent stream on the left bank : the former nearly midway between Diarbekr and Arghana, the latter about 45 miles downstream of Diarbekr. The Dibene River drains the hilly country immediately north of Diarbekr. The Batman River drains the mountains west of Bitlis. Neither of these tributaries is suitable for navigation. The Batman could possibly be used during the flood months of the year. The total length of the bridge at Diarbekr is 165 yards in two portions, one next the right bank, with a roadw r ay 30 feet wide, and five masonry arches of 22 feet each; and the other consisting of three arches of 48 feet over the main channel, and two minor arches of 22 feet next the left bank, with a roadway 16 feet wide. This bridge enjoys the distinction of being the only brick or stone bridge which still remains standing over the Tigris. At Jazirah ibn Omar a pontoon bridge existed up to the autumn of 1917 when it w T as carried away. Ineffectual efforts have been made to repair this bridge, but at present the only means of crossing the Tigris is by three boats measuring about 20 feet by 8 feet. There are also the ruins of a stone bridge. At Hasan Kaif there are the remains of an old stone bridge which might possibly be repaired. There is in addition a small kellek in use as a ferry. Animals are towed behind the kellek.11 At Deraf is a ferry boat capable of carrying three animals, three passengers, and their loads. In construction it is probably similar to those in use at Mosul. At Gormav are two boats similar to that at Deraf. At Challek is a kellek similar to that at Hasan Kaif. Both the Batman River and the Tigris above the point of junction can be forded at frequent intervals except during the times of highest flood. At low water fords exist at several points below this point, notably at Hasan Kaif and at Faish-Khabur. (b) The Euphrates System. —Of the two branches of the Upper Euphrates, the Frat River does not come into the scope of this report until its junction with the Murad, or southern branch of the Euphrates, near Keban Maden. After leaving the Mush plain the Murad River enters a deep gorge which opens in the Chabakchur plain, where the Gunik, a large tributary, joins from Bingeul; after this another series of gorges is passed until below Palu, where a wide plain is entered, which extends up to the Kharput. Thence, to the junction with the Frat River, the stream follows a narrow valley containing some cultivation and villages. - Several large tributaries such as the Gunik and the Kighi join the Murad on the right bank. After the junction of its two branches the Euphrates enters the Malatia plain, receiving the Tokma, a large stream which descends through rocky winding defiles from the Geurun and Darende districts. On leaving the Malatia plain the Euphrates enters a series of difficult gorges, with mountains rising several thousand feet on either hand and many rapids obstructing the stream, until it finally emerges into the Mesopotamian plain between Gerger and Samsat. It makes a wide bend towards the Mediterranean, receiving the Kiakhta and other tributaries from the north, circles round by Birijik, and then enters on its long course through the desert toward the Persian Gulf. At Birijik the river is usually about 300 yards wide. Its greatest width in flood is 600 to 700 yards. There is a strong current. A depth of eight feet is sometimes found, but there is usually not more than five to six feet of water. I12 At Samsat there is a large llat-bottomed boat in use as a ferry. At Birijik there is a thriving “ Shakhtur ” building trade, and from twelve to twenty shakhturs capable of carrying five tons each could ' quickly be assembled here. The rate of building is very rapid, twelve men being capable of building one shakhtur in a day. Shakhturs are rough flat-bottomed boats, usually navigated in pairs. During the war .large numbers of shakhturs were built for carrying troops and supplies down the Euphrates and it is said that the forests are seriously depleted. Above Birijik both the Euphrates and the Murad Bivers can be forded at numerous points except those reaches which run through deep rocky gorges. In these places the approaches are the chief difficulty. b if teen miles below Birijik was the iron railway bridge over the Euphrates at Jerablus, but this was destroyed by the Turkish Nationalists in 1920. The Euphrates is at no point suitable for the naviga tion of kelleks, owing to the frequent rocky obstructions in the bed of the river. Chief Towns. — Diarbekr. —Diarbekr is situated on the right bank of the Tigris, which curves round the town on the north-east, east, and south-east. The town commands the northern end of the passage between the Qarajah Dagh and the Tur Abdin into the Mesopotamian plain. The Tigris here varies in width from 80 yards at low Mater to 500 yards at flood time. For a description of the bridge see under rivers. Diarbekr has a very mixed population, consisting of Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and several categories of Christians. The latter have been reduced to approximately one-fifth of their pre-war numbers. A detailed analysis is given below : — Race. Families. Population. Moslems (Kurds, Arabs and Turks) 5,000 25,000 Armenians 320 2,200 Syrian Jacobites. . 300 1,600 Syrian Catholics 270 Chaldeans 200 1.000 Greeks — 300 Total 30,37013 Diarbekr is the chief town of a vilayet and is also the headquarters of the Jazirah front. The official, civil and military portion of the population probably amounts to between 1,500 and 2,000. The town is surrounded by a bastioned wall with a moat on the outer side, but this wall has fallen into disrepair, and, though capable of assisting in the defence of the town against tribal raids, is of no military impor tance against modern artillery. The government buildings are all at the north end of the town, and a mile outside the Kharput gate there is a block of barracks. Two main streets run from north to south and from east to west. In general the streets are narrow (10 to 15 feet wide), rough, and unevenly paved with cobble stones. There are nearly 200 khans. Drinking water is obtained from numerous sources: — (а) From the Tigris. (б) From numerous wells (water bad and brackish). (c) From the Hamarvat aqueduct. The source of supply is near Sarah Geuzlu. There is enough water to supply the whole town. (rZ) From the Ulu Jami Suyu. Water is brought in by aqueduct from Ali Punar, 1| miles to the west. (e) From the Kala Suyu. Source is outside the town. (/) From the Geul Jami. The chief source of supply before the construction of the Hamarvat. (y) From the Balikhli. Outside the town near the Bum gate. The climate in summer is very hot and unhealthy. Epidemics are frequent and opthalmia is common, there is a Diarbekr boil similar to that of Baghdad. The winters are severe but not long. The best camping grounds are outside the town on the far bank ot the river, where a slope rises to 150 or 200 feet above the river. Diarbekr is an important telegraph centre through which formerly passed the line fromFao to Constanti nople. There are also lines to Bitlis an l Aleppo, although it is probable that the line to the lattei place is not now connected.14 Diarbekr is also th6 most important road c6ntrc in Western Kurdistan. There are routes to Aleppo via Urfah, to Mosul by river or via Mardin and Nisibin, to Sivas via Kharput, to Ritlis via Sairt and to Jazirah ibn Omar via Midiat. Kharput .—Kbarput and Mezre may be considered together. The latter is also called Yeni Kbarput. Kharput proper lies on the sides of a difficult bill some 4 miles to the north of the new town. On account of its inaccessibility, its rival, Mezre, is rapidly growing, whilst Kharput is remaining stationary or even shrinking. Kharput has a population of about 17,000, of whom the great majority are Moslems. It is uncertain how many Christians are surviving, but the number cannot be large. The government buildings are situated at Mezre. There are barracks to accommodate 3,000 men, and also a military hospital. The residence of the Wali of Kharput is here. Most of the houses are two-storied, and are well built. The streets are wide and clean, and, as mentioned above, Mezre is a growing town. The water supply is practically unlimited. It is con veyed into the town from springs by underground conduits, and in addition there are numerous wells. Kharput proper is about 1,000 feet above the plain. On the south the ridge slopes steeply down to Mezre, on the north rather more gradually to the valley of the Murad. The town is dirty and cramped; the streets narrow, filthy and ill-paved. Kharput is the residence of a Qaimmaqam. Water is obtained from numerous springs, but the supply is uncertain; owing to this fact the ridge is not a suitable camping ground for troops. The best camping ground is 3 miles east of the town, where as many as 15,000 troops have been camped at one time. There are two flour-mills in Kharput and others in the district. They are worked by water-power. The plain is very fertile, and cotton, wheat, barley, vegetables and fruit are grown. As a rule there are few supplies surplus to the needs of the population. Grazing is good, but fuel is scarce.15 There is a Chaus see from Sivas which is continued to Diarbekr, and also one to Arabkhir and Egin. A Chaussee has been begun into Dersim, but is not completed. A cart track leads to Palu, but with these exceptions the roads radiating from Kharput are not suitable for wheels without improvement. Mardin. —Mardin stands on the summit of a hill on the northern edge of the Iraq plain, over which it commands an extensive view. The population numbers roughly 25,000, mixed Kurds and Arabs, with a sprinkling of Turks and Christians. The town is built on the southern slope of the hill. The houses are solidly constructed of stone, but the streets are very steep and narrow. Owing to the elevation being from 1,500 to 2,000 feet, tbe climate is better than most towns in Iraq. In winter snow is the rule, but not to any great extent. To the north are large forests, which have been badly depleted to provide fuel for the railway. There is exten sive cultivation in the surrounding districts. Cereals are chiefly grown and sheep pastured. The trade of Mardin is very considerable. All imports to Diarbekr from Mosul and Aleppo pass through it. The town is full of Khans and a large proportion of the inhabitants are caravanchis. Also there are numerous travelling merchants who visit the migratory Arab tribes with their own animals and goods. Mardin, besides being the chief town of a Sanjaq in the Vilayet of Diarbekr, forms a good centre for the collection of transport animals. Communications are good. A branch of the Aleppo Nisibin Railway runs to Izzat Pasha, the station of Mardin, but situated some 5 miles outside the town. From here a narrow gauge line runs north to Badina Tupraghi, a distance of 12 miles. This line was originally intended to bring down wood from the forests for fuel, and it was once proposed to continue it to Diarbekr, but so far nothing has been done towards realization. A motor road connects Mardin with Nisibin and Diarbekr. Other routes are to Midiat, Veranshehr and Ras al Ain. A telegraph line connects Mardin with Nisibin, Diarbekr and Midiat.it; Midiat. -Midiat lies in the mountainous country to the east of Mardin. It is the chief town of a Qaza in the Sanjaq of Mardin. Before the war it was inhabited principally by Syrian Jacobites, of whom there were 800 houses. There was also a flourishing bazaar. During the time of Christian massacres the bazaar was burned, the population scattered and the houses looted. At present the Muhammadan population is double what it was before the war, but a few Christians have returned to their homes and are trying to rebuild the town. It still remains in ruins for the most part. There is no water supply in Midmt. Drinking water is collected in rock cisterns, but during the hot weather the supply is scanty even for the local population. There is no road to Midiat suitable for wheeled transport. A telegraph office connects the town with Diarbekr. Mush. —Before the war Mush was a town of 14,000 inhabitants and the centre of a Sanjaq in the Vilayet of Bitlis. The population was Kurd and Armenian mixed. No definite news as to the present state of the town is available, but as the Armenians were originally massacred by the Kurds, and the Kurds were later driven out by the Russians and the Armenian Army of revenge, it is probably safe to conclude that most of the remnants of the town are ruins. Houses were built of wood and stone, streets were narrow and winding, and the general aspect of the town was extremely dirty. The best camping ground is east of Mush near Mogonk, where there is a large spring and easy undulating slopes near by. The climate is healthy, but cold. There is a heavy annual snowfall. The Mush plain is fertile and produces cereals. In pre-war days the surplus was exported on boats across the lake to Van. There are well-wooded districts to the south, and fuel is plentiful. Balad Sinjar.—See Chapter II., Area No. 1 (Northern Jazirah). T(l Afar.—See Chapter II., Area No. 1 (Northern Jazirah).Urfa .—Urfa stands at the north-west corner of an extension of the Harran plain. The town is hnilt on two hills with a ravine between. Through this ravine runs a small stream from west to east. The southern hill is crowned by a ruined citadel, which is now of little use against modern artillery. The streets are narrow and straggling, but the houses are built of stone and there are some good khans. Before the war there was a mixed Kurdish and Turkish population with 7,500 Armenians, but the Armenians have suffered seriously through deportation and massacre. There is a plentiful water supply entirely from springs. Some of the water is brought into the town from a distance, but the two main springs .are on the slopes of the citadel hill, whence the water is run into stone tanks. Urfa is the centre of a wheat growing district, and grazing is plentiful. Fuel is scarce and is brought into the town from a distance. Twigs, vine branches and tree stumps are used as substitutes for charcoal, which is vei^ expensive. Veranshehr .—Veranshehr is 45 miles west of Mardin. It is a small town enclosed by hills on three sides, but on the south the plain is open to Has al Ain. The population is about 5,000, consisting of Kurds and Chechens (Circassians). Veranshehr reached its greatest prosperity under the rule of Ibrahim Pasha of the Milli, who even imported some Armenian families to improve the town. Aftei t e revolt of 1908 the town was plundered by 1 urks and Arabs, but it is still the seat of the Chief of the Milh tribe, and enjoys a certain importance from that tact. Good water is obtained from springs and ^ells, and some supplies could be obtained here, chiefly animals and sheep.19 CHAPTER III. CLIMATE. General .—The climate of Western Kurdistan embraces all extremes. The whole area is completely landlocked, consequently steadying influence exercised by the presence of a large body of water is entirely lacking. Owing to its higher level, the northern portion of the area is cooler and more healthy than the southern portion, where in summer the Iraq plain is swept by a scorching wind from the north-west, and the temperature rises to 120° F. In winter snow falls throughout the whole district. North of Diarbekr the fall is sufficient to render roads temporarily impassable; in Mosul snow falls to the depth of a few inches once in every ten years. In a country so little developed and so sparsely inhabited as Western Kurdistan it is only natural that meteorological observation has been neglected. An inter rupted series of observations exist from three places only —Urfa, Diarbekr and Mosul. An exact knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the northern portion of the area is lacking, the only records being the notebooks of individual travellers. Rainfall .—The following data are available regarding the rainfall in the northern portion of the Iraq plain. The figures given represent the mean monthly rainfall in inches. Town. Jan. Feb.

Nil. 0-31 0-26 2 10 1 -91 From the above figures it will be seen that during the six months from May to October inclusive, scarcely any rain falls in Upper Ii;aq. A study of the figures for the remaining six months reveals the fact that the total rainfall for the year is almost, if not quite, incapable20 of meeting the agricultural needs of the population. This defect is remedied by the use of the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, and also of numerous mountain streams, for irrigation. These rivers have their sources in the northern half of Western Kurdistan, and their waters are maintained from the snows which fall in this mountainous district. An accurate estimate of the extent of the snowfall is impossible. Suffice it to say that in spring, when the snows melt, the depth of the Tigris is increased by eight feet and the width by as much as 300 yards. During the remainder of the year the snow- fed mountain springs maintain the normal level of the river. Snow commences to fall in the hills around Kharput in early December, and it is not until the middle of May that it has entirely disappeared. During these months miy military movement north of Diarbekr would be extremely difficult, if conducted on a large scale. On the other hand, this time of year is the best for move ment on the Iraq plain, and during these winter months troops could easily be concentrated in Diarbekr ready for an advance northward following on the melting of the snows. Winds .—The general direction of winds throughout the year is from the north-west, sometimes bearing west and sometimes north. During the winter months occasional breezes spring up from the south. The prevailing wind then passes over the plateaux of Anatolia and Kurdistan and descends upon the plains as a dry current of air, rapidly heating up as it descends from the level of the mountains. Calms are of unusual occurrence, but it is the rule throughout the area for the wind to attain its maximum velocity during the day. In the evening a strong wind diminishes to a gentle breeze which gradually gathers speed after dawn the following morning. During the summer months sandstorms frequently occur in the plains of Upper Iraq, from Urfa and Diarbekr to Mosul. The burning wind driving along with it a cloud of dust provides a most unpleasant experience, and visibility is often limited to a few hundred yards for hours together. In the higher country to the north, sand storms are unknown and visibility remains good throughout the summer. From Mardin a view of 60 miles over the Iraq plain can be obtained.21 Experience has proved that the air among the Kurdish mountains does not provide a good medium for the trans mission of messages by wireless telegraphy. In summer the air is clear enough to afford good opportunities for visual signalling. In winter clouds interfere with visibility and land lines are a necessity. Temperature .—As in the case of records of rainfall, there is an absence of accurate observations frpm the' northern portion of Western Kurdistan. Data for Urfa, Diarbekr and Mosul are available and are given below’. The most noteworthy point with regard to the tempera ture is the wide range. On the plain the thermometer varies between freezing point and 120° F. according to the season of the year. North of Diarbekr the cold weather, though probably not more intense, lasts much longer than in the south owing to the pressure of masses of snow on the mountains. But, during the hot weather, the mountainous country is much cooler owing to the greater altitude. Kharput, for example, remains bear able and healthy throughout the year; Diarbekr and Mosul are scorchingly hot for three or four months every year. Medical Conditions .—Troops in the open are exposed to great extremes of temperature, both owing to the difference between summer and winter temperatures and also to the difference between those of day and night. On the plains the population suffers from skin eruptions similar to the Baghdad boil. This is particularly the case at Diarbekr and Mosul. Europeans are also attacked. The' northern portion of the area is much more healthy than the southern, in fact, during the summer the Kurdish mountains provide many sites suitable for hill stations and sanatoria. From April to October inclusive, Europeans are liable to suffer from sun and heat strokes. With reasonable precautions this danger can be avoided. More difficult to deal with are the insects which flourish everywhere. Throughout the whole area the malarial mosquito is to be found. Experience in the hills of Central Kurdistan has shown that the field hospitals on operations become more choked with malarial patients than with sufferers from the bullets of the enemy. There is no reason to believe that conditions are any different in Western Kurdistan.\ ‘2.'5 During the hot weather flies are a great pest. This inconvenience, however, grows less and less the farther that one advances into the hills. It is only on the borders of the Iraq plain that the nuisance reaches the dimensions of a plague. From the above, it is seen that winter is the best time for the movement of troops in the plain; summer for the movement of troops in the mountains. CHAPTEIl IV. RESOURCES. General .—The resources of Western Kurdistan are essentially agricultural and pastoral. There are a few minerals, but they are not intensively worked. Manu factures are extremely scarce, and factories are unknown. The chief cereals are wheat and barley, which are grown everywhere. Next in order come rice, grown at Diarbekr, Urfa, Kharput, and Nisibin, and lentils in the Jabal Tur. Ilice straw is used as fodder for cattle. A small quantity of millet and maize is also cultivated, but the entire output is taken up for home consumption. The same may be said of sesame. Sesame oil is employed for domestic cookery and for sweet-making. The common vegetables are onions, cabbage, brindjals, potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes and beans. The common fruits are grapes, cultivated everywhere on the lower slopes of the Jabal Tur, figs, for which Sinjar is renowned, apricots, plums, pears and apples in the gardens around Kharput, Diarbekr, Mardin and Sor. Natural products are timber and galls. The latter are exported via the Tigris and eventually find their way to the tanneries of Europe. There are three qualities of oak-galls—blue, green, and white. Of these, the first is most in demand, and it appears to flourish best after a severe winter. The wood of the oak is used for fuel.24 Walnut wood is employed for furniture making, whilst poplars are built into kelleks, and are also used in every kind of constructive work. There are large forests around Birejik, Mardin, Derek and Sor. These have suffered much on account of the war; timber being felled on a grand scale for fuel for the railway, and material for shakhturs and kelleks. Tobacco is widely cultivated, the most noted quality coming from Mardin. The crop is sown in April and picked in September. Methods of agriculture are extremely primitive. Ploughs are constructed of wood and drawn by cattle. Threshing machines of local manufacture do exist, but are rather uncommon. The grain is usually trodden out by cattle. Not all of the land is irrigated, and where this improvement has been made, the Government some times claims w’ater rights. There are two sowings and two harvests. Rice, lentils, millet, sesame, and maize are sow r n in spring and harvested in autumn. Wheat, barley and beans are sown in autumn and harvested in spring. The most important domestic animals are sheep and goats. These are bred for their meat, milk, and wool or hair. The herds have been reduced during the war to between one-fifth and one-tenth of their former numbers. Cattle are employed chiefly for draught and plough purposes. Buffalo milk is good. Horses, mules and donkeys are everywhere engaged in pack transport work, particularly in the mountains, where neither wheeled transport nor camels are of any use. Camels are ex tensively used for long-distance journeys in the plains. Fowls, ducks and turkeys also exist in a domesticated state. Minerals are scarce, and are hardly worked at all. They comprise copper, galena, coal and salt. Manufactures also are rather scanty, and factories are unknown. In Diarbekr and Kharput silk-weaving w r as carried on before the war. In Diarbekr alone there were 300 looms. Wine is fermented and arak distilled throughout the grape-growing districts. Diarbekr arak is very good. A coarse cloth is woven by women in their own homes, and carpets of an inferior quality are also manufactured. Coppersmiths, blacksmiths, tanners and dyers all carry on their trades in the bazaars, but nothing is produced for export.23 There are three main routes of commerce: (a) from the Mediterranean via Aleppo; (b) from the Persian Gulf via Baghdad and Mosul; (c) from the Black Sea via Kharput or Mush and Erzinjan. Exports consist almost entirely of raw materials, whilst manufactured articles are imported. Data regarding production and surplus supplies in this area available for military use have always been scarce, but what figures have been previously collected are now quite out of date on account of the changes brought about by the war. Minerals .—Very little is known concerning the mineral resources of Western Kurdistan, and no thorough surveys have been carried out. In only a few places has any effort been made to extract the mineral wealth from the soil, but, from all appearances, if the area was scientifically surveyed, there is every likelihood that valuable mineral deposits, principally of copper, would be discovered in the mountainous region north of Diarbekr. Copper. —The more important mine at present worked is situated at Arghana, some 50 miles north-west of Diarhekr. This mine was first worked about a.d. 1096. It is now under Government control. The ore is a mixture of iron and copper pyrites, one or the other predominating as the case may be. Before the war the annual output w r as 1,200 tons. During the war every effort was made by both the Turks and Germans to increase the total output, and also to improve the methods used in treating the ore. There is a small mine producing copper at Palu, north of Diarbekr. This is worked by private enterprise. Coal. —Scams of Coal are reported at Hazo, north-east of Diarbekr. The quality of this coal is probably similar to that produced near Zakho. Galena .—There is a small mine producing galena at Eghil, north-west of Diarbekr. This is worked by private enterprise. Salt. —There are extensive salt works at Lijjeh, the chief town of a Qaza in the Diarbekr Vilayet. The production is about 250 tons per annum.Exports .—The following figures for exports both in pre-war days and at present are available. Figures given below are either in tons or in £ sterling. In the case of animals and skins the actual numbers are given. Where no figure is given it is not because exports in that particular article do not exist, but because no figures nor estimates are available. IlidcfsDistrict30 Ihinkiny. —Banks exist at the following centres, where every description of banking business is transacted: — Birijik ... The Imperial Ottoman Bank. Diarbekr ... ,, ,, ,, » Kharput ... „ ,, ,, » Mosul ... ... The Eastern Bank. The Imperial Ottoman Bank. Urfa ... ... ,, ,, t&gt; The Imperial Ottoman Bank is the State bank of Turkey, but it is financed by French and British capitalists. The Eastern Bank is a comparatively new institution, which is financed by British capital. In districts where there is no bank the position of banker is taken by the local “ Sarraf,” or money changer. He is the life and soul of all trade. His functions are to fix the foreign rate of exchange in his own district; to determine the local rate of exchange between Turkish gold, silver, nickel and paper; to act as a bill discounter and banker. Of all these duties that of bill discounter is the most important, as without this facility no trade whatsoever could be carried on. It is neither safe nor cheap to carry bullion about in Kurdistan.Supplies.32 CHAPTER V. ETHNOGRAPHY. Population .—Any attempts to gauge the statistical composition and numbers of the population in Western Kurdistan must of necessity be merely tentative. Here, as elsewhere in Anatolia, the stress of war has affected the population, and the hostility of the Nationalists has prevented the collection of any ethnographic information since 1919. In pre-w^ar days the Moslem population of Diarbekr vilayet was estimated at 275,000. A British officer, who visited this area in 1919, though reporting the popula tion w’as greatly reduced in proportion to its 1914 numbers, calculated the population of Mardin Sanjaq alone as 200,000. To compile the first of the following tables a com promise has been effected, taking into consideration every source of information which is available. Allow ances have been made for the ravages of war and massacre in the various districts, and also for the shift ing of the population brought about by the same causes. It must be understood that all figures are approximate; it is believed, however, that the following table repre sents the true state of the population better than any statistics previously published. In the second table will be found a detailed analysis of the Christians in the Sanjaq of Diarbekr. This table was compiled by a British officer who was on the spot during 1919. Throughout this report Yezidis and Kizilbashis are regarded as Kurds for purposes of classification. Paces and Characteristics.—(a) Kurds.—The Kurds are essentially a mountain people and, like all such, have cherished throughout the ages a fierce passion for personal liberty and for independence of (Government restraint. In the debatable border strip in the south of Western Kurdistan they have maintained their supremacy over the Arabs in the hilly outliers, which project into the Iraq plain.Table showing details oj the population of Western Kurdistan.34 The Kurdish race is divided against itself in the matter of language and religion. To the east of a line draw from Ezerum to Diarbekr, Kurmanji, a mixture* of Kurdish and Persian, is spoken; to the west of the same line, Zaza, a mixture of Kurdish and Armenian, is the adopted tongue. The Yezidis possess not only a dialect but also a religion of their own. The Kizilbash Kurds possess a creed which appears to he a kind of attenuated Islamism. The Kurd, as a guerilla fighter amongst his native hills, has few peers. His favourite weapon is the rifle; for this reason, and because he possesses no in-fighting weapon except the short dagger, and, above all, because he lacks the requisite courage to face cold steel, he dis likes close quarters. A campaign against a Kurdish tribe is chiefly a question of excellence in sniping. The tribal system amongst the Kurds has been adequately described in the Military Report on Mesopotamia (Iraq), Area No. 9 (Central Kurdistan). (b) Arabs .—The Arabs of this area are chiefly nomads and traders; their characteristics are too well known to require further description. (c) Turks .—The Turkish population in Western Kurdistan is very small. It must be noted that in the preceding tables those members of the population who habitually use the Turkish language have been classified under the heading Turks, irrespective of their possession of Ottoman or other blood. Practically all government positions are held by Turks or Arabs. The army is mainly officered by Ottoman Turks, whilst, owing to the demobilization of all former Ottoman subjects (but now subjects of another state, brought into being by the Treaty of Sevres), the rank and file have become to all intents and purposes Turkish. The Turkish population is, therefore, an unstable element. Every Turk is animated by the same desire-— to amass as quickly as possible a sufficiency to return in comfort to his home in Western Anatolia. {(1) Armenians .—The Armenians are found in the Aleppo, Diarbekr and Kharput vilayets as agricul turalists, traders, bankers, and artisans. Their numbers have been tremendously reduced during the war, and many have since withdrawn to Adana. Those that remain are now forbidden by law to emigrate. They are generally more intelligent and better educated than35 (£) their Muhammadan or Christian neighbours, but spoil all their good qualities by a superfluity of low cunning. They are excellent men of business, and it is commonly said that a Jew cannot get his living in Armenia. Though timid and poor fighters against odds, the Armenians have proved that they are as cruel and ruthless in revenge as their Turkish persecutors. This trait also mitigates against the popularity of any plan which has for its object the resettlement of an Armenian population in Western Kurdistan. At the present time the Turkish Nationalists are gain ing support among the Kurds by taking up an anti- Armenian attitude. This is easily understood when it is considered that many of the tribesmen and townsmen alike are now enjoying the undisturbed possession of property which was originally Armenian. (r) Chechens and These have been adequately described in the Military Report on Mesopotamia (Iraq), Area No. 1 (Northern Jazirah). (/) Syrians. —The Syrians, who are all Christians, are found scattered about in the Diarbekr, Mardin and Midiat districts. Before the war, Midiat was almost entirely a Syrian town. It is now destroyed. Azekh has been the stronghold of the Syrians throughout troublous times; refugees from all districts congregated there, and offered a successful resistance to their would-be plunderers. In Diarbekr, the Syrian Jacobites enjoyed a measure of protection unknown to the other Christian sects. The Syrians are employed both in trade and agriculture. Wherever found they are quiet and timid, desirous of living on good terms with their Muhammadan neigh bours. The defence of Azekh was the act of desperate men. In Diarbekr and Mardin the Syrians speak the local languages; in Midiat they speak Syriac. Religions .—Within the limits of Western Kurdistan three religions flourish: Islam, Christianity, and the Faith of the Yezidis. Among the Moslems the Sunni creed reigns supreme; among the Christians every little nationality has its own church, and this lack of unity has done much to deliver the Christians into the hands of their Moslem neighbours. The Yezidis alone are untroubled by schisms. (C2242) 236 (a) Islam.—Ov/iug to the recent massacres the Muhammadans now number at least 80 ]&gt;er cent, of the total population, and that in an area which was at one time a stronghold of Christianity. They are Kurds, Arabs, or Turks. Of these the most fanatical are the Kurds, although fanaticism, apart from politics, is practically unknown. The Turks appear to have played on the feelings of the Kurds in inciting them to massacre their Christian neighbours. The chief point in which Islam differs from Christianity is that it denies the divinity of Christ, but admits both Christ and Muhammad to the circle of the prophets. The last prophet to appear on the earth ranks as the most important. The principle of Cod as Unity is in sisted on as opposed to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. The Resurrection, the Last Judgment, Paradise and Hell, all find their places in the Koran. The use of alcohol is prohibited, cleanliness is insisted upon, and the position of woman is estimated far higher than has come to be in practice among the Moslems. A principle of Islam, which the Christians and pagans of the East have had much cause to rue, is that of conversion to Islam by force, if gentler measures fail. The acts of worship enjoined by Islam are five in number : (a) the recital of the creed: (h) observance of the five daily prayers; (c) fast in the month of Ramadan : (d) giving of alms; (e) the pilgrimage to Mecca. The two chief denominations of Islam are the Sunni and the Shiah sects. All the Muhammadans of Western Kurdistan are Sunnis. The division between Sunni and Shiah is based primarily on a political .and not on a religious theory. The Sunnis regard as legitimate successors of the prophet the first three Caliphs, who ruled as heads of the Moslem community, whereas the Shiahs hold that they and all the Caliphs who followed thein were usurpers, the rightful succession lying with Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet, and with Ali’s descendants. Ali and his sons Hasan and Husain, each of whom came to a violent end, are venerated by the Shiahs with a passion equal to that which they exhibit for Muhammad himself. To the Sunnis the Caliphate, or headship of the Moslem world, now belongs to the Sultans of Turkey. It remains to be seen what will be their attitude towards the Sharif37 r of Mecca, who has in recent years assumed control of the Holy Places. The Sunnis profess as unquestioning belief in the Koran and in the accepted tradition, which is a record of the sayings and doings of the Prophet, and which serves as a supplement to the Koran. On this basis various systems of Sunni law have arisen, the differences between which are merely trifling. As regards the relations of the Muhammadans with the other inhabitants of Western Kurdistan there is no obstacle on religious grounds to close fraternization. Politics, however, have intervened, and on this account Muhammadans have been incited to kill Christians. So much blood has been spilt that reconciliation now appears extremely difficult. As an example that it is politics and not religion which lay behind the late massacres, it is only necessary to note how badly the Armenians suffered in Diarbekr, and how well the Syrian Jacobites escaped. Yet both are Christians. Even now, Muham madans, Christians and Yezidis are in some cases living side by side, as in the case of the Haverki. The chief obstacle in the way of a complete reconcilia tion is the Armenian question. No Kurd will consent to live under the rule of an Armenian, and after past experiences it is very improbable that many Armenians will be willing to live under Kurdish domination. With the Chaldeans, Syrians and Jacobites it* should not be difficult to arrive at a settlement agreeable to all parties. (6) Christianity .—The Christians of Iraq may be divided into three groups, which in turn are split up into various sects. The following diagram illustrates these divisions: — Christians. 1 . Independent Asiatic Churches. 1 Uniates. i Miscellaneous. (a) Gregorian Church of Armenia. (d) Armenian Uniates. [g) Protestants. [b) Nestorians or East Svrian Church. (c) Chaldeans. (A) Orthodox Armenians. (c) Jacobites or West Syrian Church. (/) Jacobite Uniates.38 Until the comparatively recent advent of Homan Catholic and Protestant missionaries into Asia Minor and Iraq, the independent Asiatic Churches, excepting the Greek Orthodox Church, were practically the only Christians within these countries, and for the most part were untroubled by schisms. The Uniate sects are seceders from their respective independent churches. Similarly Protestants consist of a small number of con verts (mostly Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists) from the various churches, l&gt;eing mainly the resullr of proselytism by American missionaries. The Uniate churches acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the Pope, but differ from Borne and one another in ritual, liturgy, ecclesiastical laws and customs. The following sects are represented in Western Kurdistan : — (a) Gregorian Church of Armenia. —Member s of this Church, which is the national Church of Armenia, are scattered throughout the whole of Western Kurdistan. Their chief Patriarch resides at Echmiadzin near Erivan. whilst the second in importance lives at Constantinople. They are Monophysites. (c) Jucobites or West Syrians. —Followers of this persuasion are to be found in the Diarbekr vilayet with a particularly strong community in the Midiat district. They profess the Mono- physite doctrine. Their Patriarch (called the Patriarch of Antioch), Ignatius Elia III (sec “ Personalities,”^Chapter WTI), resides at Dair Zaferan, near Mardin, whilst the first bishop has his see at Mosul. (&lt;l) Armenian Uniates. —This sect forms but a very small proportion of the Armenian people. Their stronghold, however, is in Western Kurdistan, and they have an archbishop who resides at Mardin. As their name implies they are in communion with Rome. (/) Jacobite Uniates. —The community in the area under report is found at Diarbekr. Their Patriarch resides at Baghdad and they have a bishop at Mosul. Jacobite Uniates, who are sometimes referred to as West Syrian Uniates or Syrian Catholics, are in communion with Rome.39 (h) Orthodox Armenians .—These follow the Greek Orthodox Church, and are represented in Western Kurdistan hy a very small community at Diarhekr. (r) Religion of the Yezidis .—For the full description of this religion see Military Iteport on Mesopotamia (Iraq), Area No. 1 (Northern Jazirah). Languages .—Every race in Western Kurdistan possesses a language peculiar to itself. Arabic is spoken south of a line running from Zakho- Nisibin-Mardin-Urfa-Birijik. The lower sedentary Kurdish tribes have largely adopted the language of their Arab neighbours, and in places where this adoption is not complete, as for instance in the Jabal Sinjar, there is no difficulty in finding Arahic-speaking persons in the community. Kurdish is spoken north of a line running from Zakho-Nisibin-Mardin-Urfa-Birijik. Within this area Arabic is practically unknown. Besides Kurdish only Turkish is spoken to any great extent. Turkish is the language of the officials, of a large part of the army, and of those Armenians resident in the towns. This is the medium of official correspondence. Armenians all possess a knowledge of their own tongue. In the tow r ns they also speak Turkish; in the village they usually speak either Turkish or Kurdish in addition to Armenian. The practice, which has come into vogue among the Kurds since the Armenian massacres, of taking servants from among the Armenian widows and orphans has done much to spread a knowledge of Kurdish among the surviving Armenians. Syriac is spoken in some of the scattered village com munities. In the village of Azekh, for example, there are many persons who know no other tongue. Syriac speaking persons are not numerous to warrant the employment of interpreters solely for this language. Chaldean is used in the Chaldean churches. The Yezidis speak a Kurdish dialect, but with an ordi nary knowledge of Kurdish or Arabic it is possible to carry on business in the Sinjar. Jnferi&gt;r&lt; ters.— Yvom the above considerations, a force operating in Western Kurdistan should be accompanied bv Kurdish, Arabic and Turkish interpreters. These can easily be obtained from Baghdad and Mosul in large numbers.40 CHAPTER VI. TRIBES. General. —The tribes of Western Kurdistan are pre dominantly Kurdish in race and differ in no general essentials from similar tribes described in the Military Report on Mesopotamia (Iraq), Area 9 (Central Kurdistan). The geographical configuration of the district with its resultant variation in climate has reacted on the physical life of the people, and effected a rough division of the tribes into sedentary and nomadic. The latter, owing to their seasonal changes of habitat, form the most restless part of the population, but while, as a general rule, it is from the wandering tribes that trouble is to be expected, the sedentary tribes of Western Kurdistan do not differ much from their nomadic tribes men in this respect since contact with western civilization in Constantinople and Aleppo has stirred the immemorial independence of the Kurd of these regions to a certain national consciousness. This expresses itself in resent ment at Turkish suzerainty, and indicates continuous tribal trouble until a satisfactory modus vivendi is reached by the Kurds. Tribal Population and Armed Forces. —The total tribal population of Western Kurdistan is roughly computed at 300,000, i.e.y 60,000 families, or 120,000 men capable of bearing arms. The number of serviceable rifles is calculated at 35,000. Arms and, Ammunition. —The Kurd lays great value on the possession of a small-bore rifle. Before the war the commonest type in Western Kurdistan was the Martini, which was obtained from a factory in Sulaimani and from the European markets. During the war the Turks attempted to raise tribal auxiliaries, and for this purpose issued numerous Mausers and ammunition. It is needless to say that the Kurds accepted the rifles and used them not infrequently against the donor. Another source of supply during the war was from refugees fleeing before the Russian advance on Erzerum. After the armistice the Turks, compelled by the Treaty of Sfevres to hand over all surplus armament, were glad to sell as many rifles as possible at a low price to the tribes,41 Afc present (he most popular rifle amongst the Kurds is the Mauser service rifle. Ammunition for this is most easily obtainable from Turkish military towns, especially if (he Turks have any ulterior motives in view. Ifussian ami CJreek rifles also exist, but ammunition for these is difficult to come by. The quantity of Mauser ammunition available varies from 100 to 400 rounds per rifle. Generally speaking the tribe on good terms with the local authorities never has to complain of a lack of ammunition. Diabekr, Mardin, Jazirah ibn Omar and Nisibin are all possibly supply centres of both rifles and ammunition. It seems unlikely in their present straits that the Turks will surrender entirely the idea of forming tribal militias. For this reason the supply of rifles and S.A.A. to the tribes is not likely to diminish. Fighting Characteristics and Tactics. —The fighting characteristics afid tactics of Kurdish tribes have been adequately discussed in the Military Report on Mesopo tamia (Iraq), Area No. 10 (.South Kurdistan). It has been established that aeroplanes are of little offensive use against tribal gatherings in the Kurdish hills. Scrub, oak and the jumbled nature of the hill surfaces preclude the existence of good targets. Similarly this kind of terrain also militates against the utiliy of aeroplanes for reconnaissance work. Tribes in relation to possible Centres of Disturbance .— (i) Jazirah ibn Oxnar. —Around Jazirah ibn Omar the only tribes of any importance belong to the Miran Confederation. The Turkish authorities, imbued with hazy but grandiose ideas of a march on Mosul in 1919-20, made strenuous efforts to win over the various chiefs to their side. As the Miran are absolutely dependant both for their supplies and passage over the river to and from (heir summer quarters on Jazirah ibn Omar, there has never been any course open but friendship to the authorities in possession of that town. The present paramount Chief of the Miran, Naif Reg, has not com mitted any hostile act against the Iraq Government, but has been active in robbing kelleks of Iraqis proceeding from Zakho to Mosul. In the event of an advance on Jazirah ibn Omar from the south, the Mi ran would probably throw in its lot primarily with the Turks, but would change sides as soon as that town was occupied.42 (ii) Mardin and Nisibin.—TYie, tribes in this area have been widely canvassed to provide Milice or Militia. The movement met with considerable success as the later formation of Chattas or irregular troops. The discipline of these troops is bad; the organization is slight, and their fighting qualities little superior to those of the untrained tribesmen. The power of tribal resistance in this area has also been impaired by the coercive methods adopted by the Turks in recruiting. In case it should be necessary to involve the Turkish authorities in difficulties, the Haverki and Dakshori would prove the most suitable agents. (iii) Veranshchr and Lias a! Jr//.—Mahmud Bey and the other sons of Ibrahim Pasha of the Milli control the tribal situation in this area. At the moment the Milli are pro-French and ani-Turkish. Political Attitude.—The present political attitude of tribes in Western Kurdistan is still indefinite. Dunng 1919 the Turks favoured the establishment of committees to propagate the idea of an independent Kurdistan. Finding that this movement was becoming hostile to them selves as well as to the Christian powers, and also seeing that a fresh massacre of the remaining Christians was the probable outcome of the activities of these committees, the Turkish Government had them all closed down. Diarbekr and Mardin were the chief centres of this movement. Since the closing of the committees very little has been heard of the Kurdish Nationalist movement, Haji Ahmad Agha (are “Personalities,” Chapter VII), is said to be an ardent Nationalist, but he can do nothing by himselt. Mahmud Bey (see “Personalities,” Chapter VII), ot the Milli, is one of the candidates for the first presidency ot the Kurdish State if this ever materializes. His family is the second in rank of the ruling houses of Kurdistan, and it is the first in present power and influence, the only rivals are the Bedr Khans. Recently, however, Mahmud Bey appears to have quarrelled with the lurks and to have thrown in his lot with the French. The remaining tribes only have a hazy conception of Nationalism. If by Nationalism is meant a wide sort ot autonomy where each chief controls his own distuct w 1 1 out hindrance and without paying taxes to any outside authority, then such men as Izzat ud Din of the Dakshuri would be ardent Nationalists.4.3 (2%) During the last twelve months the Turks have enormously extended their power and influence over the tribes. This has been done by gifts of arms to those tribes that they can trust and by military expeditions against those that are impatient of authority. The confederation of Ali Batti has been broken in the field, and the Chief has been replaced by Hajo, a recent prisoner at Kharput who may at least be expected to be friendly for a few months. Abdul Karim of Challek has been beaten in the field. Abdul Qadir al Darogh of the Karagaj is still in prison at Diarbekr, and his successor, Kasab Shaikho, is a man extremely hostile to any foreign interference in Kurdistan. The French have obtained so far only the friendship of the Milli. This is due to the fact that the Kurds consider that the French identified themselves with the cause of the Armenians, and will support the latter in projects of revenge. Also it appears that Moslems are dissatisfied with the French administration in Syria. After the armistice the prospects of the British were bright, and it seemed that their advent would normally have been welcomed by a large number of Kurds, including probably Mahmud Bey of the Milli. But a change in the state of affairs is attributable to the following causes: — (a) Turkish propaganda. (b) The failure of the British to occupy Jazirah ibn Omar after the armistice when so many rumours were going about concerning the approaching occupation. Punitive Measures .—Western Kurdistan is a moun tainous district and experience has shown that in his native hills it is almost impossible to induce the Kurd to stand and fight a decisive action. As in Southern and Central Kurdistan, a rising in this area is unlikely to take the form of spontaneous or combined effort on a large scale by the tribesmen themselves, but would be more in the nature of discontented Aghas, determined to defy the Government, ordering their retainers to render support. A rough analogy can be made between the tribal Kurds of this area and the peasants of feudal England, who, in return for protection and a means of livelihood, followed their lord’s commands in all his private quarrels. It is then, from the point of view of such a rising against an established government that some of the more impor tant punitive measures can be briefly considered.u (]) Use of the larger towns as bases for operations into hostile territory in order to destroy the villages and crops of the recalcitrant tribesmen. This method, how ever, has one serious drawback, inasmuch as it hits the industrial class, viz., the Aghawats’ retainers, whilst the Aghas, who are solely to blame, remain little affected. (2) To seize every means of discrediting the Aghas in the eyes of their followers. (3) To maintain one or two completely equipped mobile striking forces at such strategic points as Jazirah ibn Omar and Mardin. The Turks have small garrisons in all the chief towns, but this has not the same practical utility where British and Indian troops are concerned. Economic measures of repression, if used alone, are not likely to be of much avail against the tribes. They are all self-supporting or get what they lack by barter from their neighbours. The occupation of strategic points and the prohibition of traffic is, therefore, not likely to succeed in reducing a tribe to submission. There is one exception to this: the occupation of Jazirah would cut off the Miran from their winter habitat, and would deprive the tribes of all agricultural produce. Their only remedy would be to barter their herds for grain among the Shernakh, Goyan and neighbouring tribes. This could probably not be done on a sufficiently large scale, and the Mil an would be forced to submit to any terms imposed in return for permission to visit their winter lands.45 Tribal Lists. In view of the fact that very little is known regarding many of the tribes in Western Kurdistan, it has seemed better not to arrange all the tribes in alphabetical order, but to group many of the smaller ones together according to fixed geographical areas. This has been done so that by referring to any desired area, it is possible, by looking at the meagre details for several individual tribes, to get a fair idea of the tribes in the area as a whole. This, however, has not been done in the case of some of the larger tribes and confederations, which remain under their own headings with the geographical areas in alphabetical order. In case it is necessary to refer to a small individual section or tribe by name, a complete list of sections and tribes is shown in the index, together with particulars of the area, tribe or confederation under which they are to be found. Owing to the recognized inaccuracy of pre-war intelli gence regarding Kurdish tribes, no tribe has been in cluded which has not been mentioned cither during or subsequent to the war.(g) r&gt;i I’ERAZT 5. 0. 7.

The Haverki group consists of a collection of Kurdish tribes living in the east of the Qa/.a of Midi at and in the west of the Qaza of Jazirah ibn Omar. The tribesmen are principally Sunni, but also include some Jacobite Christians and Yezidis. I he Haverki fall into two large divisions: the first, consisting of the Alika, Dermamuka, Muzezak, Saliha and Saiyida sections, together with the Christian village of Azekh, are all under the overlordship of the members of the family of Usman Agha; the second consists of the Arabi, Beravi, Dumana and Qaza Alika sections, which are each under their own individual aghas. I he family of Usman Agha is descended as follows: — This family has been engaged in constant disputes with t ie Links. In 1916 Hajo, Chalabi and Sarhan were removed from Midiat and imprisoned in Kharput. Ali Batti, with the sons of the three captives, was left to govern the tribe. But things went from bad to worse. Ali Batti raided Nisibin, held a regimental commander to ransom, and attempted to seize the government of Midiat. Troops were sent against him, the captives were released, Ali Batti was killed and Haio ami Usman. Unknown. Unknown. Unknown. Unknown. Hajo. Ali Batti. Chalabi. Sarhan. Yusuf. Muhammad Salih. Sarhan.

He has warred with Ali Batti, and in 1920 had a Turkish expedition sent against him. He was compelled to submit owing to the defection of his tribesmen of Challek, who were detached from his cause by Turkish intrigues. The position of the Christians in this area is worthjf of special notice. Abdul Karim and the other inde pendent aghas of the Haverki were considerably anti- Christian in their policy. Ali Batti, on the other hand, protected his Christians. The result has been that all Christians in the neighbourhood have gathered together in Azekh, a Jacobite Christian village under the control of Ali Batti. Here they have successfully defended themselves against the hostile tribes, and Ali Batti made their cause the reason of his quarrel with Abdul Karim. In addition to the major portion of the Haverki, the descendants of Usman Agha control the Sarhan, Solkan and Chomar tribes of Midiat, which have nothing to do with the Haverki. The future of the Haverki is doubtful. None of the present chiefs have reason to love the Turks, but they certainly do owe their restoration to the action of the government. The latest news to hand states that Hajo and Chalabi are quarrelling, but that they have both agreed to raise Miliee forces among their tribesmen.58 Cnnfrdoration, Tribo or Section. Chief?.

Nevertheless Khalil Bey and Hasan Bey are Tuvkophile, but state that it is immaterial to them whether they are under a Turkish or Sharifian government, as both are Islamic. The tribe, which is probably of Arab extraction and speaks bastard Arabic, has lost its tribal character. It is well off, perhaps more so than before the war. The chiefs, although they are the titular heads, wield little power outside the village of Kefr Howar. They are unpleasant people, independent and grasping. History .—The tribe state that 350 years ago they were Christians. During a famine of corn they asked per mission of the Patriarch to eat meat during Lent. The Patriarch refused and they became Moslems. The women wear red clothes and do not veil. They have recently received a considerable amount of mixed Arab stock. Another history is that they were originally the Bani Halal Arabs, and occupied the stretch of country south of Nisibin. Many years ago a seven years’ famine split the tribe up, one section migrating to Tunis and the other, now the Mahalami, taking up their present quarters. (C2242) o66 1.

From earliest times these three branches have been enemies and have waged war against each other. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, in the days of Sultan Mahmud, there were three great princes in the south-east of the Turkish Empire: Ayub Bey, great-grandfather of the present Chief of the Milli, ruled in the Jazirah; Muhammad Bey, the “ Kur ” Pasha of Rowanduz, was master of all the lands from the eastern frontier to Mosul; while Shaikh Sufuq was Chief of the Southern Badawin tribes. These chiefs lived in great state and constant war, and paid no heed to the Sultan at Constantinople or to the Wali at Baghdad. At last Government could disregard their activities no longer and the great Rashid Pasha was sent against them. Muhammad of Rowanduz was seized and killed, while Shaikh Sufuq and Ayub Bey were made prisoners and carried to Diarbekr, where they died. The Turks then became completely masters of the country. Shortly after this, when war with Egypt broke out, Timawi Bey, Ayub Bey’s successor as Chief of the Milli, joined the Egyptians and captured Mardin. He was, however, shortly afterwards killed in a skirmish, and on the re-establishment of Ottoman supremacy, the Milli tribe was reduced to abject poverty and misery, in which it remained until Mahmud, Timawi’s son, grew up. After many vicissitudes the latter succeeded, with the grudging help of the Wali of Damascus, in driving back the Tai and Shammar, and collecting together the remnants of the tribe at Veranshehr. In a few years he attained considerable prosperity and power, and eventually had the hardihood to build a castle at Veranshehr. Omar Pasha, who was then Wali of Diarbekr, soon crushed this movement, burnt the castle and carried off Mahmud as a prisoner. Here he remained for some time, until, at the repeated petitions of his son, Ibrahim Pasha, he was released, only to die as the result of the hardships of his captivity. Ibrahim then became head of the tribe, but as a result of his turbulence and robbery was soon seized and exiled by the Turkish Government. After six months or more he managed to escape, and making his way back to the tribal country, where he remained as an outlaw, he eventually patched up a peace with the Government.71 At the close of the liusso-Turkish war Ibrahim began to give signal proofs of his ability and gradually by his diplomacy built up the power and the strength of his tribe, gathering to him all the lesser shaikhs of the neigh bouring tribes. Before long, under his sagacious rule, the Milli became stronger than they had ever been previously. About this time Ibrahim, with some other Kurdish chiefs, was enlisted in the Hamidieh, and after a visit to Constantinople was given the rank of General, and the title of Pasha. His policy now grew bolder, and he was not only able to resist the Anizah and the Shammar, but to clear his districts of the worst of their parties. He made it his policy to protect the Christians and collected many of them in Veranshehr, where a thriving bazaar soon sprang up. It is estimated that during the large Armenian massacres previous to the Great War he saved some 10,000 Christian lives. He made friends with the powerful Aral) Jais tribe, while the Afadli, Baggarah, Sherahin and the Kurdish tribe of Chichihieh joined his confederacy; the Tai, Jubur, Anizah and Shammar becoming his mortal enemies. It was not long, however, before by his diplomacy he succeeded in winning over a large and important section of the Shammar under Shaikh Jarullah. In 1904 a quarrel with the Karagaj led to a conflict with the Turkish troops in which a Turkish officer was shot, and it looked as though Ibrahim Pasha was about to lose his power. But his boldness and diplomacy again triumphed, and up to the period of the outbreak of the World War his power was as great as previously. In the spring of 1921 the Milli were in rebellion against the Turkish Nationalist Government, and defeated a mixed force of Chechens and Turkish regulars. A great part of the tribe vacated the tribal area and migrated to the Jabal Abd al Aziz between Ras al Ain and Hair al Zor. It is, however, not yet known whether this change of habitat is merely temporary or permanent. The Milli Confederation comprise some forty-eight tribes of various sizes, most of them nomad, in the triangle formed by Nisibin, Urfa and Diarbekr. Other tribes outside this area, even as far away as Dersim, recognize the Milli Chief. Many of the tribes in the following list are dealt with under the heading of their own particular Qazas, and in very many cases the bond holding the tribes to the Confederacy is of the very flimsiest.73 MILL!. 5. 6.

In the days of Sultan Abdul Hamid the Miran Con federation under the leadership of Mustapha Pasha, a powerful personality, was notorious for its looting pro pensities and general lawlessness. While the majority of the tribes is now more law-abiding, the former charac teristics survive in several of the small Miran families which still indulge in minor raids and petty thieving. Mustapha Agha received the title Pasha as a reward for providing two regiments of cavalry under the Hamidiyah system. Naif Beg ibn Mustapha Pasha, the present chief of the Confederation, is said to be a fairly sensible politician who has no aversion to living under British protection (which he would do if we occupied Jazirah ibn Omar), as long as his past misdeeds are forgiven. At the instiga tion of the Turks, the Miran were responsible for the massacre of nearly 900 Christians at Faishkhabur in 1915, and the fear of reprisals for this massacre has influenced their attitude towards the British. The Miran are wholly nomadic and, beginning their migration northwards at the end of May, spend the whole of June on the journey. They pass through Jazirah ibn Omar and then on to their summer grazing grounds via Shernakh and Artushi country. With the former there is generally friction, as Abdul Itahman Agha of the Shernakh tries to levy toll on all vho pass through his territories. Friendly relations exist between the Miran and Artushi. During July and August the tribes remain in their summer quarters, beginning their southern migration in September. By the end of September they are generally established in heir wunter habitat. The Miran do not actually winter in the Mosul Vilayet, but live close to its borders, which they occasionally cross near Chilparat. In winter each tribe has its own particular grazing ground, but in summer the various tribes feed their herds on common pasturages.77 Like all migratory Kurds, the Miran do not entirely depend for supplies on any town or towns. They are practically self-supporting, their flocks supplying them with food and clothing. Action could be most easily taken against any particular tribe or tribes by keeping them off their winter grazing grounds, which are in most cases easily accessible to troops. The Miran, though numerically weaker than they were before the war, are better armed. It is believed that 50 per cent, of their arms are modern small bore rifles.79 MIR AN o. 7. Armed Men. Hides.

The Karagaj were originally a nomad Turkoman clan of Western Anatolia, and were settled by Sultan Salim on the slopes of the Karajah Dagh. The object of this transfer was to compensate Kurdistan for the loss of the Ziriki, Tirikan and other tribes, which the Ottoman Government had forcibly settled in Western Anatolia. The Karagaj quickly intermarried with the local Kurds of inferior origin, and soon became to all intents and purposes a Kurdish tribe talking the Kurdish tongue. The tribe was later joined by many families of nomadic Kurds, who hoped to share the good treatment they ah first received from the Government. The tribe is semi-nomadic, brutal, savage, and in describably filthy. It has a bad name in every respect, and being on the high road gets a bad name for all Kurds. The numbers of the tribe are being continually increased by outcasts from other tribes and by evildoers of all descriptions. Note .—Another tribe of the same name and probably of the same original stock belongs to the Herazieh Confederacy. The chief of the tribe, Abdul Qadir al Darogh, was imprisoned in February, 1919, at Diarbekr by the Turks. The tribe is now ruled nominally by the mother of Abdul Qadir, but actually by a certain Kasab Shekho, who appears to have a character akin to that of the late Ali Batti of the Haverki,91 KARAGAJ. 500 1,000 100 000 400 700 lu itlliuncc with tlie KaraKaj ami the floshin under tlie.« leadership of Kasab Slieklio (vide Karagaj).

A native of Mardin and one of Hie most influential citizens. He was a member of the Kurdish Com mittee, and also joined the local Milice Committee when that was formed. Occasionally he canvasses the tribes with anti-British propaganda. AHMAD AG HA, HAJI. Haji Ahmad Agha resides at Avina quid controls the Surgjchi and Shaikhan tribes. He made an excel lent impression on Major Noel in the spring of 1919, at which time he was an ardent Kurdist Nationalist. At the beginning of 1920 he was brought into Mardin by a Government gendarme escort, and persuaded to give a promise to furnish a certain number of Milice troops. He appears to have been compelled to make an outward show of joining the Turkish National Party. He is a Kurd of considerable force and enlight enment, who keeps his tribe in exemplary order. He always submitted to properly constituted authority, and when the war broke out he assisted the Turks to conscript his tribesmen. Now, to his chagrin, he sees his villagers reduced in numbers whilst the surround ing tribes have scored by not helping the Turks. He is said to be actuated by a considerable measure of Kurdish patriotism, but at the same time he is not Chauvinistic. He struck Major Noel as being dis tinctly sensible and level-headed, and likely to play an importamt part in the future politics of Kurdistan, jrip. date this impression has not been realised, ilaji Ahmad Agha has a son, Kaimil (q.v.}. AHMAD AL SENUSSI. See Chapter VII, Report on Area 1 (Northern Jazirah). AKIF BEY (Lieut.-Colonel). Succeeded the quiescent Ali Beg as Officer Commanding 2nd Division in August, 1920. During his tenure of omce Akif Bey has been very active in inciting the joider tribes to attack the British. His headquartersare at feairt, but he frequently visits the storm-centre of Jazirah ibn Omar. A rampant Nationalist and consequently very anti-British. In June, 1922, it was Reported, fhat Akif had vacated his post for another in the Nationalist’s Western Army. C IT A LAB I IBN USMAN. With Ha jo (q.v.) joint Chief of the Haverki. Chalabi was imprisoned by the Turks for some time in Khar put, but was released in January, 1920, for the purpose of murdering Ali Batti, who was at' that time the paramount Chief of the Haverki, and who had previously been giving the Turks considerable trouble. This pleasant task Chalabi faithfully per formed. Was active in support of the Milice move ment at Midiat in March, 1920. IIA JO. Joint Chief of the Haverki Kurds with Chalabi {q.v.). Was imprisoned by the Turks between 1914 and 1920. Assumed his present position on the assassination of Ali Batti. His brother, Sulaiman Effendi {q.v.), was the assistant Qaimmaqam of Nisi bin in 1921. IGNATIUS ELIA III. Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch residing at Dair Zaferan Monastery, near Mardin. His baptismal name is Nasri. Born at Mardin, 30th October, 1867. Educated at Dair Zaferan Monastery. Ordained priest, 1892. In 1899 elected Patriarchal Vicar at Mosul, and in 1902 to the same post at Diarbekr. Became Bishop in 1908 and made Bishop of Mosul in 1912. Elected Patriarch in 1916. Decorated by the Turks (1st Class Mejidieh) in 1917. He is a clever diplomat of the eastern type, and has never wished to break with the Ottoman authorities or seek European protection. He is a bitter opponent of the Catholic missionaries. During the war he advised his people to offer no opposition to the Turks. His advice being followed in most cases, the Jacobites were practically un molested by the Turks. IZZAT-UD-DIN, AG HA. Tzzat-ud-Din Agha is the Chief of the Karjaus, Raman and Habesbani sections of the Dakshuri. With these tribes he can put in the field 1,500 men, of whom 800 would be armed with modern rifles. His headquarters (C2242) E.are at Kasri. Izzat-ud-Din is a man who possesses some local influence, and he used to oppose his combi nation of tribes to that of the late Ali Batti of the , Haverki. Ffe has many murders to his credit. In 1918 he was out against the Turkish Government, hut was badly defeated and his castle was burnt. He hardly knows his own mind. Just after the armistice he was well disposed towards the British, but recent propaganda has made him distrustful. The tribes around complain much of his extortions. Izzat-ud- Din also controls the Zir section of the Dereveri tribe. Since Ali Batti’s murder Izzat-ud-Din has been the most powerful chief in the Midiat Qaza. JEVAD PASHA. Lieut.-General Jevad Pasha, Commander of the Jazirah Front at Diarbekr, is the son of Arabkirli Shakir Pasha, A.D.C. to the late Sultan, Abdul Hamid. Born in Constantinople in 1873, he obtained his diploma at the Galata Serai College in 1889, and, after going through the Military School, passed out with the rank of Staff Captain in 1893. Appointed A.D.C. to the Sultan through the influence of his father, who was then Chief of Staff. Later he was sent to Germany to complete his military studies, and upon his return assumed his post at the palace. Upon the proclamation of the Constitution he was appointed Officer Commanding 2nd Division of the Guards, and in 1909 Director of the Staff Officers’ School. In 1912 he become Colonel, and in 1913 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General and appointed General Officer Commanding Defences of the Dardanelles. In consideration of his services after the evacuation of the Dardanelles by the Allies he was made General Officer Commanding 8th Army with the rank of Lieut.-General. He was in command of the Army in Palestine, which was routed on the eve of the armistice. In November and December, 1918, he held the post of Chief of the General Staff, and during the early stages of the armistice was responsible for the greater part of the obstruction caused by the Turkish Army. During the rise of the Nationalist movement was one of its strongest and (deverest supporters in Constantinople. Arrested and sent to Malta in 1920. Released from internment in 1921 and proceeded to Angora. Appointed to the command of the Jazi-rah Front in November, 1921.99 Height 5 tt. &lt; in.; complexion i'airish; large nose; oiown moustaches; large front teeth; mejlium build; prominent eyebrows; dark blue eyes; walks with a slight stoop. Very Germanophile; knows good German and French; sober habits; well educated and capable administrator: charming manners; obsessed w ith the idea that the Turks are far superior to any other race. KAMIL EFFENDI. Appointed Qaimmaqam of Jazirah ibn Omar in December, 1921. Anti-British, but does not appear to be making himself particularly felt. KHALIL BEY. Khalil Bey is the Chief of the Mabalami in the Qaza of Midiat. He resides at Kefr Howar. 11 is uncle, Khalaf Bey, was recently executed by the Turks, but nevertheless Khalil appears Tureophile. Khalil Bey considers it immaterial whether he is under the Turks or under the Sharif as both are Islamic powers. KHALIL IBN IBRAHIM PASHA. Khalil is the brother of Mahmud, Chief of the Milli Kurds. He resembles his elder brother in face and manner, but is more alert and impetuous. Very shrewd and intelligent. He knows how to read and write. He has been a good deal in Constantinople and has a desire to travel further. In the Turkish army he saw service at Bulair in 1913 and near Erzerum in 1914. He ranks as a Qaimmaqam (Lieut.- Colonel). Khalil has nothing to do with the policy of the tribe, which is all in the hands of Mahmud, but he is the executor of the wishes of Mahmud. In time of trouble he would probably be the fighting leader of the Milli. KIAMIL BEY. Kiamil Bey is the son of Haji Ahmad Agha of Avina (q.v.). He was educated as an engineer in Switzer land, but when war broke out he returned, joined the Turkish army, and served as a liaison officer with the Germans. He is said to be an ardent Kurdish 'Nationalist actuated by genuine patriotism. Though strongly in favour of Kurdish independence he supports the idea of a British mandate. (C2242) k 2100 MAHMUD BEG 1BN IBRAHIM PASHA. Mahmud Beg is paramount Chief of the Milli Confede ration. For the past history of this Confederation see under “ Tribes.” Mahmud or Mamo is a rather slight, delicate man of about 30, with a fine face, dignified, good manners, possessing a sense of humour and ready to laugh. Cannot read or write (which he bitterly regrets), but is intelligent and progressive. He has built his own house, a public hammam, a cafe-club, a big Khan, a fine mosque and a number of shops, all in Veranshehr. He has developed and planted large gardens and is now working at land irrigation. He wants to build schools and introduce teachers, and is proud of having built a number of villages and of having induced people to settle on the land. Is very religious, but is not bigoted. Mahmud Beg has no reason to love the Turks and his bitter feuds against the Nationalists in 1920-21 have in no way modified this attitude, but rather accentuated it. To interviewers he has always appeared pro-British, but it is now three years since a British representative went to see him, and much has happened during that time. There is every reason, however, to believe that he is pro-French. MUSA BEY, HAJI. A leading notable of Mush. Headed a local rebellion against the Turks in January, 1921, driving the Nationalist officials from the town and sacking the public buildings. NAIF BEY I BN MUSTAPHA PASHA. Naif Bey is the Chief of the Miran tribe and also exercises influence over a confederation of tribes of which the Miran is recognized as the head. Mustapha Pasha, the father of Naif Bey, was responsible for having increased the influence of the Miran; under his son it has tended to decrease. In 1915 Naif Bey helped to murder 900 Christians at Faishkhabur, and he now refuses to listen to any offer of British friend ship until he is first assured that his part in this massacre is completely forgiven. After the armistice he was quite ready to try and come to an agreement on these terms as it appeared likely that we should occupy Jazirah ibn Omar, a strategic point which controls the wanderings of the Miran tribes. InI)eceml&gt;er, 1920, his tribe in their migration fired on Irnq kelleks coming down the Tigris, for which act ot aggression they were bombed with salutary effect. Although no further trouble has since occurred, it is possible that Naif Bey still remains anti-British. NUBI BEY. Bimhashi Nun Bey is at present sub-Chief Staff Umcer, 2nd Division, the headquarters of which are at hairt. Formerly Officer Commanding 24th Regi ment at Nisibin, he relieved Bimhashi Arif Bey in this position as the latter was not successful enough m ns efforts to inculcate the spirit of the new lurkish Nationalism into the minds of the tribes of the district. Nuri Bey is a friend of Kenan Bey, late ( ommander of 5th Division, and w T as appointed at the request of the latter, being transferred from the command of a regiment in the 2nd Division At the time of the first occupation of Kirkuk, Bimbashi Nuri Bey was in command of the Menzil there. After the occupation he departed to Kharput, where he was employed in an unknown position. From there he returned during 1919 to the 2nd Division, being placed in command of the recently formed 6th Regiment. In 1920 he was transferred from here to the 24th Regiment. QAS1M AGI1A IBN ABDI CHALABI. A notable of Mardin. Was stated to be the ring leader of a Moslem society, which in May, 1921, was actively engaged in oppressing the Christian elements in that town. SHAFIQ EFFENDI. Qaimmaqam of Jazirah ibn Omar for a short period previous to Kamil Effendi (q.v.), who succeeded him in December, 1921, when Shafiq became Qaimmaqam of Ras al Ain. SHAUKI EFFENDI. An inhabitant of Diarbekr. During the war he joined the Milice specially formed to escort parties of deported Armenians, in which force he obtained a commission. Fie speedily distinguished himself by the way in which he murdered parties of Armenians entrusted to his care, and in consequence became very wealthy. At present his outlook on politics is102 influenced by the desire to retain all the wealth that he obtained by murder and spoliation. This can best be done by supporting the National Party, and consequently Shauki Effendi is an ardent Nationalist. He is a member of the new Milice, and it is said that if he takes the supreme control of the Milice there will be a marked improvement in the numbers and enthusiasm of this organization. SUL AT MAN EFFENDI. The assistant Qaimmaqam of Nisibin and a brother of Hajo (q.v.) the joint Chief of the Haverki. SULTAN BEY. Sultan Bey, until recently the Qaimmaqam of Jazirah ibn Omar, is a man of 47 years of age. His family belongs to the section of the Jubur on the Khabur Biver. At the age of 12, Sultan was sent to school in Constantinople, where he studied agriculture among other subjects. During his tenure of office at Jazirah ibn Omar there was an increase, if that were possible, of propaganda emanating from that place and spreading among the Kurdish tribes along the northern frontier. CHAPTER VIII. COMMUNICATIONS. Roads .—Compared with the remainder of Turkey, this area is well supplied with roads. In the north there are one or two military chaussees, and in the south there are numerous roads passable for light wheeled carts and field guns. On many of these it is possible for motors* to run. In the heart of the hilly districts the tracks are impassable for wheels, and pack transport only can be used. In the rainy season the unmetalled roads become sodden very quickly, but two or three days of sunshine dry them sufficiently to render them passable for light wheeled vehicles. In the north the roads are rendered impassable * The word “ motors ' throughout this chapter means automobiles up to, and including, the weight of a Ford van or light F.l.A.T. lorry. No information is available as to the number of cars which could run over the road during a definite period.]03 during the winter on account of snow. At such times it is necessary to keep to the chaussee roads, and even then ii is doubtful if moderate sized bodies of troops could inov'e along them with their transport. The following roads in this area are metalled: — (&lt;t) Diarbekr-Arghana-Kharput. (b) Diarbekr-Farqin-Bitlis. (c) Diarbekr-Severek-Birijik (partly metalled). The following roads in this area are normally passable tor wheels, such as the arabanas in common civil use: (a) Mosul-Nisibin-Mardin-Diarbekr. (b) Diarbekr—Chermuk-Severek—Urfa. (r) TTrfa-Veranshehr-Mardin. (&lt;/) Jazirah ibn Omar-Demir Qapu-Nisihin. (c) Diarbekr-Almadin-Sairt. (/) Khar put-Arghana-Severek. (g) Kharput-Palu-Mush. Other roads are in general passable only for pack transport, but many could easily be improved into cart roads. Methods of Travel. —Where the road makes it possible, the wealthy traveller moves about in an arabana—a light four-wheeled cart capable of carrying three or four passengers and their baggage. The arabana is drawn by two horses. The ordinary traveller throughout the district hires a mule or donkey, and attaches himself to a caravan going in the required direction. Horses cannot as a rule be hired. They are much esteemed and are privately owned by wealthy inhabitants. A small pack pony gives a more comfortable ride than a donkey. An arabana can cover 30 miles in a day; a caravan averages 20 miles per day in good weather. Motor cars are occasionally employed to take travellers into Western Kurdistan, but the practical impossibility of obtaining spare parts and the lack of petrol in this area militates against their more frequent use. Travellers rest the night at'-the end of each stage either in the open air or in khans, where such are available. Solitary travel is not safe on account of the predatory instincts of nearly all the inhabitants of Kurdistan. By remaining with a caravan a traveller escapes having the whole of his goods looted on condition that he pays his share of the sum claimed by the natives, through whose country the road passes.104 Between Aleppo and Nisibin, the railway at one time ousted all other forms of transport, but unfortunately it is not at present in working order. Railways .—The only railway line which either exists or has been projected in Western Kurdistan is the proposed German line from Aleppo to Baghdad and its offshoot to Mardin. It was intended that this line should run from the Anatolian railway terminus at Aleppo to the Euphrates at Jerablus, and thence via Harran, Ras al Ain and Nisibin to Mosul on the Tigris, thence via Tikrit and Samarrah to Baghdad. Up to 1920, when the bridge at Jerablus was destroyed, trains were running as far as Nametli, nine miles east of Nisibin. Between Nametli and Mosul the track has been surveyed and traced out, a slight amount of work has been done on the embankments and cuttings, and a few station buildings have been erected, but it is doubtful if these still exist. A branch line formerly left the main track near Derbisiyah running to Izzat Pasha, the station for Mardin town. From here a narrow gauge line extended northwards to Badina Tupraghi, a distance of twelve miles. This line was originally con structed to facilitate the transport of timber and fuel from the hills north of Mardin. It was subsequently proposed to continue the track to Uiarbekr, but nothing appears to have been done in this respect. With the exception of tw T elve miles of narrow gauge mentioned above, the whole track was laid with standard 4 teet 8.\ inch metals. The rolling stock is of German origin, but there is very little of it and that is in very bad condition. On the run from Aleppo to Nisibin only two locomotives were in working order in 1920 and the trucks badly needed overhauling. Owing to lack of coal it was found necessary in the later stages of the war to use wood fuel, with the result that constant delays to clean out the fireboxes were unavoidable. I p to the end of 1919 trains were running regularly as far as Nisibin, and also on the branch to Mardin. , , ' &lt; ? m Aleppo to Ras al Ain the track was properly ml lasted and remained in fair condition. From Ras al Am to Nisibin there was no ballast, and it is believed that a great outlay of time and money will be necessary i? ^ e *, . e tr a &lt;* tn a fit state to stand heavy traffic. «o&lt;ent intelligence shows that the line between Jerablus105 .iml N is!bin has been seriously damaged by the inhabi- . ds of the country through which it passes, most of the permanent way having been removed for fuel or for use as girders m the construction of buildings. TIm inost vulnerable point of the line is the iron bridne [be*' ^ u P h r a ‘ es at Jerablus. This was destroyed in the fighting between the French and the Turkish Nationalists in 1920, but recent reports indicate that i is being leconstructed under the supervision of French engineers. ^ Aerodromes and Land inn Grounds.

South of the railway station, distant from the town. three miles Nothing better than cultivated ground to the west of the town. Sor. —Nothing suitable. Daek. On the plain, three miles to the south. Between Mardin and Derek.—A.t Chinareh, on the nar row guage line and eleven miles from Mardin, there is flat ground half a mile to the west. Much work is required. Diarbekr. Half a mile from the town on both sides ot the Kharput road. AExisting Turkish aerodrome. Inland Water Trans port.—In the whole of Western Kurdistan there are only two navigable rivers, viz., the Euphrates and Tigris. Of these the Euphrates is not used above Birijik, where it passes out of the area. Below this point there is a brisk traffic carried on downstream by means of Shakhturs—a name given to the locally built flat-bottomed barges. For a description of these' boats, see Chapter II.—Rivers. On the Tigris there is considerable traffic all the way downstream from Diarbekr. Power-driven craft are unknown for the simple reason that there is no traffic upstream. The rafts employed for drifting down are106 called kelleks. They are built of a framework of rough poles supported on numerous inflated goat and sheep skins. On arrival at the port of destination the timber is sold while the skins, after being deflated, are returned overland to the starting point in readiness for the next trip. The size of a kellek is reckoned by the number of skins, and payment is made accordingly. A good-sized raft would be of 400 to 500 skins. The largest rafts in use have about 800 skins. A kellek of 200 skins measures approximately 29 by 20 feet. The load of a kellek varies from five to thirty tons according to the number of skins; they can only move with the current and, if properly con structed, are practically unsinkable. They are kept in midstream by two rough sweeps. At the present time this method of travel is largely employed for goods and passengers from Diarbekr and intermediate places to Mosul; at Mosul it is usual to change into a fresh kellek and proceed downstream to rail head, now at IShergat. The chief goods carried are oak galls and cereals. Telegraphs and Telephones. —The details of the accom panying skeleton map (page 106) of the telegraph systems of Western Kurdistan are taken from the official Turkish handbook in use in November, 1918. At present there is no traffic over the Turkish-British frontier, i.e., between Zakho and Jazirah and between Hogena and Dugir. It is not known how far the same modification applies with regard to the French frontier in the Aleppo Vilayet, nor what new military lines the French have constructed. A telephone service is known to be at present main tained between lias al Ain, Mardin, Diarbekr, Nisibin and Dugir. It is probable that this is extended to some other offices. Posts .—The Postal arrangements leave much to be desired. The service is irregular and unsafe. Merchants and private persons find it safer and more expeditious to entrust their letters to travellers or professional cara- vanchis, who deliver them on receipt of a small reward. The post to Angora and Constantinople is supposed to leave the chief towns twice weekly. It is thought that this official service is better maintained than over the other routes.107 The mail bags are transported by pack animals or, where possible, by the railway. Motor services are unknown. A gendarme escort accompanies the postman, who himself is often a gendarme. Wireless .—The only known wireless station in this area is situated just outside Diarbekr on a small hill. Description of Routes.

Climate .—Heavy snow and rainfall make the route im passable for the greater part of the winter. In the spring the country is covered with herbage. In summer the heat is intense and sandstorms in the open parts of the route are of frequent occurrence. Aerodromes .—Landing grounds exist at Nisibin and Diarbekr, but no details as to size and condition or exact location are known. There is an aerodrome at Kharput, but the presence of any serviceable aeroplanes or material is very doubtful. Tactical .—From Nisibin-Mardin (mile 37) the route is commanded by a high range of hills running parallel to the track at a distance of two to five miles. In the Diarbekr-Kharput section the road is often revetted out instead of cut into the rocks, theieln rendering it capable of being easily blocked.

It is therefore probable that supplies would be comparatively plentiful. Mardin —District is surrounded with cornfields, vine yards and orchards. Wheat, barley, sesame, vegetables and rice are grown.114 Transport. —Horses and camels are obtainable at Nisibin in considerable numbers, but no information is available regarding the remainder of the route.

General .—The forces of the Turkish Nationalist Govei n- ment in Western Kurdistan and Northern Jazirah are composed of: — (a) Regular troops. (h) Gendarmerie. (r) Police. (d) Chattas.118 {(t) Regular Troops. Recruits for the Regular Army are obtained by con scription. Every Muhammadan male between the age of twenty-one and forty-two is liable to be called to the colours. Members of the gendarmerie and police force are normally exempt from military conscription, but recently (May, 1922) younger members of these services have been forced to serve with the colours. Xationalities Employed. —In February, 1922, 45 per cent, of the officers were Kurds, 35 per cent. Turks, and 20 per cent. Arabs; while of the rank and file 45-50 per cent, were Turks, 45 50 per cent. Arabs, and 1 per cent. Christians. Discipline .—Desertion is frequent and many recruits do not join the colours at the appointed time. Others evade •conscription by bribery. The Army is closely linked with politics, and an officer, however capable he may be, must be a good Nationalist or resign his post. Mustafa Kemal, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, is in constant dread of an opponent and heavily punishes those who show, or whom he suspects of having, counter revolutionary or reactionary tendencies. Uniform, Pay and Rations .—Up to the end of 1921 the question of uniform, pay and rations was a serious one, and largely affected the number of desertions. The troops were badly clad, especially as regards boots, their rations were poor, and their pay often as much as three months in arrear. By June, 1922, matters appear to have improved, and the majority of the troops are clothed in khaki drill uniforms manufactured at Diarbekr. Im provement was also evident by this date both as regards the regularity of pay and the quantity and quality of the rations. Organization and Distribution. —At present (July, 1922), the Nationalist Army in Western Kurdistan con sists of a formation corresponding to an Army Corps, composed of one weak infantry division (2nd Division) and corps troops. The headquarters, which is known as the headquarters of the troops on the Jazirah Front,” is at Diarbekr. The 2nd Division is composed of three infantry regiments, viz., the 1st, 6th, and 18th; also a storm battalion. Each regiment is divided into three battalions and each battalion into four companies, in cluding a machine gun company. With the exception of the machine gun companies, each company is divided119 _ - into three platoons, which are sub-divided into an inde finite number of sections of one N.C'.O. and eight men. In addition to the three battalions, every Turkish infantry regiment is supposed to have a machine gun company, but so far none of the regiments in this area appear to have been provided with such a formation. The storm battalion is by far the strongest battalion in the division. The average strength of a battalion is 150 to 200 rifles, while that of the storm battalion is approximately 450 rifles. The infantry are armed with the Mauser service rifle, and are well supplied as regards ammunition. Tn addition each battalion has on the average four machine guns, some being also equipped with French auto-rifles. Corps troops consist of the 9th Cavalry brigade (still in the process of formation), 2nd Artillery Regiment, a composite battalion, a depot battalion, 33rd Recruiting Regiment, Labour, Engineer. Transport and Medical units. The 9th Cavalry Brigade is composed of the Isl and 23rd Cavalry Regiments (the former consisting of three squadrons of seventy sabres each and the latter of two squadrons of the same strength). The 2nd Artillery Regiment is divided into two battalions, each consisting of two batteries, armed with Schroeder or Krupp Q.F. guns. Vinces of Military Importance.—The chief places of Military importance are: — 1. Birijik.—An important post on the Euphrates. 2. Urfa.—Headquarters of the 9th Cavalry Brigade and centre of Shaikh al Senussi’s activities. 3. Khar put.-—Here there is a remount depot, a large dump and aerodrome. This place forms an important link with Sivas. 4. Ras al Ain and Yeranshehr.—Outposts opposing a hostile advance from the Mediterranean. 5. Diarbekr.— Headquarters of the forces on the Jazirah front. 6. Mardin.— Has a strong garrison and an ammunition dump. 7. Farqin. (Silwan) Almadin. Sor. Midiat. Garrison towns.120 s. Sairt.—Headquarters of the 2nd Division. 0. Bit!is. An important link with the Turkish Army on the Caucasus front. 10. Nisihin and Jazirah ihn Omar.—Outposts opposing a hostile advance up the Tigris. Strength.- Total strength of regular troops in the area under report on 1st July, 1922. Rifles 2,635 Sabres 140 (exclusive of the squadrons west of Euphrates). Guns ... ... 21 Machine Guns 44 Distribution Table.—A general distribution of the Turkish regular troops on the “ Jazirah Front,” i.e., in Western Kurdistan in July, 1922, is shown in appendix (6) Gendarmerie. The gendarme forces are recruited by voluntary en listment. Every Vilayet maintains a regiment of gen darmes, the headquarters of which are situated in the chid town of the V ilayet. Similarly every Sanjaq and Qaza maintain a battalion and a company respectively, with the unit headquarters in the chief town of the civil division. Battalion and a company headquarters are dependent on the headquarters of its next higher formation. TA e .duties of the gendarmerie are many and varied. 1 hey include the enforcement of the frontier regulations against travellers both entering and leaving Turkish territory; the rounding up of deserters from the regular army; safeguarding the main roads between the large towns; and the crushing of any disturbance of the peace, which gets beyond the control of the police but does not warrant the employment of troops. The Gendarme service is very popular among men of military age. It releases them from the necessity of join ing the Army; the bonds of discipline in the gendarmes are very light, and, owing to the nature of the duties to he performed, there is ample opportunity to make a small fortune by bribery or threats. In Western Kurdistan the proportion of horsemen to tootmen in the gendarmes is about 1 to 3.}. Both mounted and dismounted men are armed with the Mauser sei \ ice lide, those mounted carrying sabres in addition.r l lie strength of each company is roughly sixty men, and of these 70 per cent, are maintained at the Qaza headquarters, the remainder being scattered throughout the district. The total strength of the Turkish gendarmes in the area under discussion amounts to 170 cavalry and 620 infantry. In time of war these men are valuable auxiliaries to the Army as a means of collecting supplies, furnishing guides and rounding up deserters. Also it is not unusual for them to be employed in the fighting line in the same manner as a regular regiment. (c) The Police. The Police are responsible for maintaining order in the large towns, i.e., in the headquarters of the Vilayets and Sanjaqs. In most Qazas the police duties are per formed by the gendarmes. There are a few exceptions to this rule, e.g., Nisibin, which has its own police force. In no case does the authority of the police extend outside the town. In the chief‘town of a Vilayet, 70 to 100 policemen are maintained. These are under the control of a Mudir, who is usually nominated by Angora but works under the instructions of the Wall. This force is split up into smaller divisions among the various quarters of the town. Each division is under the control of a Com- missaire. In the chief town of a Sanjaq the police num ber from thirty to forty. They are under the control of a Commissaire, who works under the instructions of the Mutassarif. The police are all dismounted, unless they care to make use of their own private horses, and are only armed with a revolver. Their duties are to maintain order in the streets, to investigate crime, to execute the judgment of the law court, and to take charge of convicts. In the case of petty crime the Mudir has the power to settle the matter out of court. In the event of the situation get ting beyond their control, the police must call upon the local gendarmes for assistance. In actual fact the Turkish police are the most venal of all the public services. Every member of the force lives by bribery and corruption. There is no danger to a criminal, provided he produces sufficient cash, to pre vent the revelation of his misdeed. In such circumstances it is not surprising to learn that crime and disorder flourish even in the centre of the government of a Vilayet.122 ((f) Chattax. (Irregular tribal levies.) •Since the armistice the Turkish military authorities have consistently tried to supplement their regular and gendarme forces by irregular levies for miscellaneous duties, but chiefly for the control and regulation of the tribes. Previous to the inception of the chattas, an attempt was made to raise an irregular tribal force called the Milice. This, however, failed as it was thought to be an attempt to renew the Hamidieh system, and the chattas have since been formed. Men of this force are not enlisted for any specific period. They are all mounted and provide their own arms and horses; but they receive regular pay—fifteen paper liras per mensem—with cloth ing, rations and forage for their mounts. The service for this reason is popular, and it is not uncommon for regular soldiers to desert in one part of the country and join the chattas elsewhere. The bulk of the personnel are towns men, whom the war has ruined, and Moslem refugees. Although chattas are warned that they are liable to be called upon to fight in case of emergency,* their military value is uncertain, and it is doubtful whether they would be employed for other purposes, in the event of an offen sive, than raids into neighbouring countries. It is difficult to gauge the strength of this force owing to its fluctuation, but from available information it is probable that there are not more than 1,000 sabres in the area under review.
