Kemball states that, should Robinson receive a visit either from the Joasmee [Āl Qāsimī] Chief [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī] or from his son, he should introduce the subject of an act of piracy that was committed in March by his dependant, Yedeedee, upon a Zanzibar buteel, off the coast of Africa. In addition, Kemball instructs Robinson to pay the agents of Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh] and Sharjah their respective salaries up to 1 December, and to deliver the pension due to the widow of Moollah Hussein (also spelled Houssein). The details of the salaries and pension are included in this letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612308.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
