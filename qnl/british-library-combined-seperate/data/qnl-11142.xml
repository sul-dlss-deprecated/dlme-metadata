Curzon considers the possible diplomatic, commercial and strategic motives for constructing the railway line.Curzon argues that if the line has been suggested merely as a diplomatic rejoinder – that is to say, as a response to a Russian concession from Baku to Teheran [Tehran] – then the proposal is of little merit.He suggests that if the line is being proposed for its commercial value then this should be demonstrated by the figures of trade. Moreover, Curzon argues that the line's commercial effect on any future extension of the Nushki railway beyond Dalbandin should also be considered, since both lines would then be competing for the trade of East Persia and Khorasan.Curzon suggests that one strategic advantage of constructing a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman would be the prospect of diverting a future Teheran–Yezd–Kerman Russian railway line away from the direction of India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston George Nathaniel Curzon</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kerman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bunder Abbas </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khorasan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Teheran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Railway lines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00014f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
