The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, requested that the Sultan of Muscat issue a notification to the Omani shaikhs not to attack these towns, or to otherwise hinder the trade undertaken by British subjects. Drafts of the notification are passed between the Sultan, the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Political Resident. The letters also discuss the Sultan’s health, his probable visit to Bombay, his inability to protect Muscat and Mutrah during his absence, and his payment of debts.The volume also contains correspondence related to the declaration of a British protectorate over Oman, the rebellion of Shaikh Salih bin Ali al-Harthi and his followers and their attack on British subjects in the areas under the Sultan’s control.The majority of the correspondence is between 1895-1896, apart from (f 61) which is dated 1900.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Ṣāliḥ bin ‘Alī al-Ḥārthī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ghāfirī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>al-Sharqiyya</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nizwa</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Maṭraḥ</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00025e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
