MEMORANDUM. Regarding our future relations with Persia, with special reference to the extension and maintenance of British influence, and to the system of British Consular representation in Southern Persia. It is presumed that a new subdivision of Persia into spheres of influence will form a part of the general settlement after the war, and that in this new delimitation the present “ neutral zone ” will disappear, and that the whole country will fall under two spheres of influence—Russian and British ; and it may fmther be assumed for the purposes of this Memorandum that the line of division will follow approximately the line at present defining the southern boundary of the Russian sphere ; that is to say that the whole, or practically the whole, of the present neutral zone will fall to the sphere of Great Britain. Ihere will no doubt have to be minor rectifications made in defining a new boundary, but it is practically certain that the provinces of Ears and Arabistan, and the greater part of the Bakhtiari country must be included in our sphere. 2. Proceeding on this assumption the question arises for consideration, what system of consular or other representation we propose to adopt in this great area which will best ensure the maintenance of our influence, and of law and order. Before commencing the consideration of this problem there are two alternative suggestions regarding the future of Southern Persia which I will mention, but which, I think, may be dismissed as lying outside the sphere of practical politics. 3. d ho first is that we should decline to extend our influence beyond our present zone, and should leave the existing neutral zone as it is. The events of the last few years have, I think, shown that such a course is impolitic, and indeed impracticable. It is impossible for us to allow this area to continue any longer in the welter of disorder which has prevailed for some years past, and which has culminated in the present state of chaos. It is an axiom of administrative policy that a settled government cannot continue to exist indefinitely side by side with unsettled and disorderly tracts of country; and that sooner or later the logic of events must compel the civilised power to absorb the uncivilised tracts on its frontiers, or at any rate to take steps to ensure the restoration and maintenance of order there. I he present boundaries, and the political history of England and Russia during the last century in Asia, prove the truth of this proposition. And besides this it is clearly impossible that certain portions of Persia should now be brought under civilising influences and a regime of law' and order, and that certain other portions should be left in a state of lawlessness and disorder as before. Such an incongruous arrangement could never work in practice, and sooner or later one of the two protecting powers would be compelled to extend their influence over the areas in question ; and as it would not be politic or convenient for us to allow' Russia to dominate any considerable portion of Southern Persia w'e should be compelled eventually to intervene ourselves. 4 The second alternative is that of constituting all Southern Persia an Independent State, or splitting it up into tw^o or more independent States, of course under our protection. Such a course is not an impossible one, and it might conceivably, in certain circumstances, have to be taken seriously into consideration ; but as this is not at present within the range of practical politics I do not propose to discuss it here. 5. Proceeding then on the assumption that Persia will remain as Persia, and that the British sphere of influence will include the whole southern area SS r*)4 Aas defined roughly in the first paragraph above, we have to consider how this influence may be rendered effective, and how British interests may best be represented and protected in our sphere. G. The first and most obvious point to be borne in mind in the consideration of this matter is that, as long as Persia remains a single State, whether really independent or under the joint tutelage of Great Britain and Russia, the interests of Great Britain must continue to be represented as at present by a British.Minister at the capital of the country, namely, Tehran. It is unnecessary to elaborate this point which is an obvious truism of universal application ; but it is necessary to state it and to bear it in mind. 7. Working under the Minister there must, of course, be Consular officers in each province. Following the usual custom the Consul or Consul-General of each province should reside at the capital of the province and have under him such Vice-Consuls as are necessary to assist him; and each provincial Consul or Consul-General should, in the natural order of things, communicate directly with the Minister regarding the affairs of his own province. 8. This again is an obvious truism which would scarcely need stating were it not for the fact that the existing system of Consular representation in Southern Persia presents certain anomalies and inconsistencies, and appears in some respects to ignore the elementary principles of Consular represen tation in foreign countries as formulated above. This is a matter regarding which I have already submitted certain observations, and I would invite a reference to my despatches on the subject written from Shiraz during the year 1913, as well as to those of Sir Percy Cox ; and to Sir Edward Grey's despatch summing up the matter and expressing his own views, and to Sir Walter Townley’s reply to this last. 9. Briefly put, the anomaly consists in this: that the Resident in the Persian Gulf has gradually acquired a sort of undefined status regarding the south of Persia which might almost be said to constitute him a kind of informal Minister for the south, and which gives him the position of Adviser- in-Chief to the Indian Government regarding great tracts of inland Persia ; whilst, although residing at a seaport some HOC miles from the capital of this province, he is styled “Consul-General for Ears.” This situation is admittedly anomalous, and has been characterised by Sir Edward Grey as “ illogical.” It has, no doubt, grown up gradually together with the Resident’s general position and status in the Gulf, and is a relic of an old- fashioned system which has now completely changed. Formerly, we had no proper Consular representative at Shiraz (such Consular duties as there were being performed by a Native Consular Agent) and it was natural that the Resident at Bushire, who frequently visited Shiraz during the summer months, should be styled “Consul-General for Ears,” and should maintain a general interest in, and direction over, Ears affairs ; but with the creation of a iegular Consulate at Shiraz this position became anomalous, and ivas necessanly and inevitably a source of friction and misunderstanding. I would again refei to my despatches on the subject for a full exposition of my views. S enera l question of the position of the Resident m the lersian Gulf it is clear, to begin with, that Bushire itself is a place of small intrinsic value or importance. It is merely a landing place (for it can scarcely be termed a “ Port ” in the proper sense of the word) for goods and travellers starting for inland Ears, and possibly for Ispahan and beyond ; and even this amount of importance will disappear as soon as Shiraz is in ve( up y railway Avith Bunder Abbas, when Bushire Avill sink into comp e e insigni icance as a petty port serving the needs only of the immediate hinterland districts. The present importance of Bushire is, in fact, purely artificial and is due to the fact that it is the headquarters of tde Resident. I he Resident has to live somewhere ; and Bushire, being hisheadquarters, looms very much larger in all Gulf questions than its own actual value entitles it to do. It is, no doubt, a useful point whence to conduct the management of the Gulf littoral, but there is no shadow of a reason why it should be regarded as a centre whence the affairs of great inland provinces like ivernian and bars should be supervised and directed. 11. Even in pre-war days these considerations were valid and carried weight, but with the shifting of the centre of gravity of Gulf politics from Bushire to Basrah their force is redoubled. The question of our future arrangements in Mesopotamia is one which will, of course, have to be settled later, but we may presume at any rate that some high official, whether of the British or of the Indian Government, must reside at some centre in that country. Now if it was (as is admitted) anomalous, and even absurd, to expect an officer residing at a small seaport like Bushire to act as adviser to Government regarding the affairs of inland Persia concerning whose internal questions he is necessarily ill-informed and ill-qualified to give an opinion, it would be still more anomalous, and still more absurd, to expect an officer residing at Basrah or elsewhere in Mesopotamia to perform these functions. I do not think indeed that any advocate, however zealous, of the present system could rationally recommend such an arrangement. 12. But it may perhaps be contended that the creation of fresh British appointments in Mesopotamia, wherever they may be located, need not necessarily alter the status or the duties of the Resident at Bushire. It would no doubt still be possible to retain a Resident at Bushire (and at this moment there is a Deputy Resident occupying the post), but 1 think that it will be evident on mature consideration that the raison d'etre for such an important and highly paid appointment has now vanished. With the transference of the political centre of gravity to Basrah, Bushire sinks automatically into its proper insignificance as a small and very inferior seaport. It cannot be said to be the centre of any big political interests, and it has little or no political or other connection with inland Persia, except, of course, by means of the trade which passes inland or which arrives from the interior. The affairs of the Gulf itself, and of the immediate hinterland, will have, of course, to be regulated in the future, as in the past, and I shall endeavour lower down to show how this may be done quite simply and efficiently ; but to maintain a Resident at Bushire in the new conditions, and in view of the lessons and warnings of the past, would be, as I venture to think, indefensible from any point of view. 13. This long, and, I fear, tedious preamble, brings us to the question of what the future system of Consular representation in South Persia is to be ; and the suggestions which I am about to make are so simple and so obvious that were it not for the confusion, of thought which seems to exist regarding the whole question of Southern Persia, and for the fact that certain old-fashioned arrangements of a vicious and anomalous character have first to be condemned, they might have been presented in a few words on a single sheet of paper. * 11 As shown in the earlier paragraphs of this note (presuming my arguments are accepted as valid), we must in the future (as at present, and in the past) have a Minister at Tehran with Consuls working under him in the various provinces, the senior Consul or Consul-General residing, of course, at the capital of the province in each case. All that is necessary, therefore, is to decide how many Consuls or Consuts-General we require in Southern Persia, and at what centres they shall reside. This is a matter of detail regarding which there will, no doubt, be differences of opinion, but I venture to submit my suggestions tentatively as follows. I here should, I think, he Consuls or Consuls-General at the following places : — (1) Sistan (as at present),^ (2) Kerman (for the Province of Kerman), (3) Shiraz (for Ears, excluding the Gulf hinterland),(4) Mohammerah (for Arabist an), (5) Bushire (for the Gulf and hinterland affairs), (6) a Resident or Consul in the Bakhtiari country, each with such Vice-Consuls, or Consular Agents, under them as are neces sitated by the circumstances of the case. And these Consulates should, I venture to think, be held by officers of the Indian Political Department, and the Consulates run on the lines of our Consulates at Seistan, Meshed, and Kerman. 10 . i ao not propose to enter into any detailed discussion here as to how the administration of the country may best be conducted in our sphere of influence under the new regime. Details will naturally differ in each province, and improvements will be effected as time goes on. But. generally speaking, we may presume that His Majesty’s Minister will act as the authoritative adviser to the Persian Government regarding all questions of administration and policy in Southern Persia ; whilst the Consuls at each main centre in our sphere of influence will similarly act as the advisers to the Governors or Goyernors-General, very much as they do at present but with this important difference, that their advice will now have to be followed In this respect the situation in Egypt presents certain analogies As regards finance, a central control will, no doubt, be exercised at Tehran by means of some system to be agreed upon between Great Britain and Russia - and it would seem desirable that a “Financial Adviser” (an Englishman of course) should he appointed to each provincial capital to advise and assist the Persian Finance Agent m his dunes. Order will be maintained by the Gendarmerie (or military) force under British officers. But as stated abovV'i, is not possible to discuss details of the administration here. The important point is that out . onsuls, working m communication with His Majesty’s Minister will m future he in a position practically to direct the working of the administrative machinery in each province, and to see that order s maintained, and the finances properly conducted. 16.

This state of affairs is, of course, abnormal and wi terminate when Persia begins to resume a normal state.’ My proposals are in fact intended for use in the immediate future when the war is over m,d when die work ol reconstructmn is in progress: and for this purpose they should, as I believe and hope, provide a practical working method of a sufficiently satisfactory nature, whilst at the same time giving the Indian Government all due weight and voice in all matters whicl d ecdv concern it. .19 To begin with when the Consular officers in Southern Persia are benig found by the Indian Government they will naturally owe special allegiance and loyalty to that Government; and this without at all inter fering with or prejudicing their relations with the Minister, will inevitably influence them in all questions which affect India, and will facilitate their mutual co-operation in the general problems connected with the restoration and maintenance of order m the South. The Consul at Bushire in charge of the Gulf and hinterland interests would probably be in constant direct communication with the Indian Government regarding his special charge (as would also though perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent, the Consul ft oiammerahy, the other Consuls would carry on their duties precisely as at present on a system which works well and without friction at Meshed and feeibtan. lhat is to say, that the bulk of their correspondence would be regarding matters of internal economy and domestic or provincial policy and would naturally be directed to the Minister ; but that they would also communicate freely with the Government of India on all questions which specially affected or interested that Government. Indian interests would in tact be well and loyally safeguarded, and in any larger questions of policy or strategy which might arise the views of the Government of India would of course, carry due weight with His Majesty’s Government as at present, I he actual increase of work involved in the Foreign Department due to this arrangement would, in my opinion, be very small—scarcely appreciable in fact. The correspondence of the British Consul at Bushire would probably be somewhat Jess m volume than was the correspondence of the Resident' and the other Consuls would only refer to India from time to time on special occasions very much as they do at present. 20. The arrangement may not perhaps he an ideal or a strictly logical one, but at any rate it provides a practical modus operandi which is all that can be expected in practical politics. And it has besides the very great advantage of doing away with the present anomalous system of dual control which is vicious in principle, and has been a fruitful source of misunder- standing, friction, and even disaster. 21. I would venture, in conclusion, to submit a few remarks on the strategical bearing of my proposals, for although this subject lies somewhat outside my province, it is one which must of necessity be taken into consideration in any discussion regarding fresh lines of demarcation in Persia. 1 would begin by saying that a new line defining the spheres of influence of England and Russia must be a political line—not a strategical one A glance at the map will prove this. It will obviously he impossible for theIndian Government, or indeed for the military forces of the Lmpire, ever to defend a frontier extending over some 1,000 miles east and west and unprotected by any natural features such as mountains or rivers. Such an idea need not, I think, even be considered, and should India ever again in the future be confronted with a Russian menace, this line would have to be frankly abandoned, and the present schemes for the defence of India need suffer no modification. All, in fact, that these proposals contemplate J s the establishment of a modus vivendi in Persia in conjunction uith Kussia. ^ ihe future must look after itself, and the adoption of my suggestions need in no wav prejudice or hamper our military dispositions and plans foi the de em e of India, nor involve us in any new military responsibilities.

The memorandum considers what system of Consular or other representation should be adopted in order to maintain not only law and order, but also British influence in the area.Before discussing the issue of Consular representation, O'Connor mentions two alternative suggestions regarding the future of Southern Persia (the first being that Britain should decline to extend its influence beyond its present zone, and the second being that Southern Persia should be turned into one or more independent states), which he dismisses as lying outside the sphere of practical politics.Assuming that the British sphere will encompass the whole of Southern Persia, O'Connor advocates the continuation of the existing post of British Minister at Tehran (located in the Russian sphere), and suggests that the Minister should be supported by Consular officers residing in the capital of each province. O'Connor suggests that Consul or Consul-General posts – to be held by officers of the Indian Political Department – should be present in the following places: Sistan [also spelled Seistan in this file] (as at present); Kerman (for the province of Kerman); Shiraz (for Fars, excluding the Gulf hinterland); Mohammerah [Khorramshahr in modern-day Iran] (for Arabistan); and Bushire (for the Gulf and for hinterland affairs).In addition, O'Connor advocates the appointment of a Resident or Consul in the Bakhtiari country. He suggests that his proposed Consulates be run in the same way as the existing Consulates at Seistan, Meshed and Kerman.O'Connor goes on to address the problem of the rivalry between the Home Government and the Indian Government on the subject of Southern Persia. He makes the following two proposals: either Southern Persia should be placed under direct control of the Indian Government, or it should be guaranteed that the Minister at Tehran will always be an officer from British India, who has been nominated for the post by the Indian Government.In this memorandum, O'Connor suggests that the future arrangement of Consular representation in Southern Persia has been made complicated by the anomalous status of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. O'Connor argues that, in the post-war period, whilst it would still be possible to retain a Resident at Bushire, it would not need to be such an important and highly paid appointment; he appears to imply that his proposed Consul at Shiraz and Consul at Bushire would take over the Resident's responsibilities regarding inland Persia and the Gulf and its hinterland respectively.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight William Frederick Travers O'Connor</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kerman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shiraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mohammerah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000151#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
