The original contributions agreed to by the Government of India have lasted longer than was expected, but the fund is now almost exhausted. Mr. Mackereth’s letter was forwarded to the Government of India and their reply has now been received. They do not approve of the suggestion for repatriating the destitute females, as in the absence of any poor lav/ they would very likely starve. They have, however, agreed to continue to pay a small compassionate allowance to the women during their lifetime but are not prepared to contribute tov/ards the children. The Government of India do not fix th© amount of the allowance to be paid, but ^00 *rrt presumably it is to continue on the same scale, which must be barely the subsistence level.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to previous correspondence, of which the lust communication from your department was Mo* 10 (K 2734/714/289} of March 13, 1936, relating to the relief of British Indians in Syria. 2. The ‘balance of the sum authorised for the relief of destitute British Indians in Syria is now £30 2 3:10 reduced to thirty pounds three shillings and ten pence. As explained in my despatch No. 20 of February 21, 1935 relief has now been restricted to five absolutely destitute Indian women. At the present rate the authorized sum for relief will be exhausted next December. 3. In order to spin out the meagre assistance I hi ve been obliged to reduce the monthly allowance Pto.Sy.200 to two hundred piastres (about 10/2) in the case of Pts.Sy.150 four women and one hundred and fifty piastres for the fifth. (It was originally fixed at 600 Pts. Sy. a month.) They are- able to supplement this by begging from their compatriots. But Beit Saws., where the Indian colony is concentrated, was, as you are aware, seriously damaged in the 1925 rising when century old miter courses were diverted or destroyed beyond repair. I need not remind you that no compensation for the His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Etc., Etc., Etc., damage / c# Foreign Office, S.W.l•i- '', ix,• • ■ ' ;-.v. w '-w. ' ^ B damage done in that rebellion has been p;. id to the sufferers, consequently those Indians who, having been liable to immigrate to Palestine or Iraq, remain in Damascus live on the borderline of misery and they are in no position to help their even more unfortunate sisters who receive alms from the Indian government through this Consulate. 4. It is in view of these circumstances that I venture to request you to urge the Government of India to continue the compassionate allowance at the present scale, or, alternatively repatriate them and their minor children to India where, presumably, they can be cared for under the poor laws of that country. I attach hereto a list of the pi*esent beneficiaries. I have the honour to be. With the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sd.) GILBERT MACKERETH,f ” * u Copy : ’ / ' r J ,C i / / O 1 (K 2834/714/289) I f BRITISH CONSULATE, No. 20. 1 f9d5 J DAMASCUS, f91/291/66) February 21, 1935 Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 3 (714/714/289) of January 24, 1935 and its enclosures dealing with the subject of the relief of British Indian subjects in Syria. 2# In his communication No. P.Z./7393/34 of January 11, 1935 the Secretary of State for India mentions a previous communication No. P.Z./6854/32 of November 14, 1932, a copy of which does not appear to have been sent to this consulate. I was, therefore, unaware that a time limitation had been imposed for the disbursement of the additional sum of £150 authorised in 1932. In this ignorance I had already paid out this year relief amounting to £.Syr.28 before your despatch under reference was received in addition to £23:3:4 already debited in my Account Current for the 3rd and 4th Quarters of 1934* 5 . A slight discrepancy appears between the figures shown by the India Office accounts and those of this consulate. At the end of the June quarter 1934 (after the debit of £11:14:1) £1093:16:6 had been disbursed from this fund leaving a balance of £56:3:6 from the total sum authorized of £1150, and not £54:8:5 as shown in the India Office's letter of January 11, 1935. In India Office note No. P.Z./7393/34 of January 11, 1935 addressed to the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India it is stated that The Right Honourable Sir J. Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., O.B.E., K.C., M.P., His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London, S.W.1.that up to the end of the financial year 1933-1934 £1061:7:7 had been expended in this relief, which does not tally with the balance of £54:8:5, quoted above, which was arrived at after an additional sum of £11:14:1 had been debited to the fund of the June Quarter 1934. According to the books of this consulate the total sum expended up to the end of the financial year 1933-1934 was £1082:2:5* To facilitate investigation I transmit a statement showing the disbursements made during each quarter since the beginning. 4 . The granting of relief has been most carefully controlled by this consulate with a view to spinning out the grant as long as possible and to providing, except in case of physical incapacity, a diminishing assistance. The continued fall of sterling has unfortunately rather militated against this purpose. At present only five absolutely destitute Indians remain, all of them are either aged or crippled women. It will be a hardship amounting almost to cruelty if the meagre alms they enjoy from the India treasury is now cut. I have, etc., (Sd.) GILBERT MACKERETH.■wasttmnmmamm • -Upr.-r*.

Please see the minute at P.Z.4356/32 in the hound volume below where we agreed to the disbursement by the Consul at Damascus of further expenditure of not more than £150 towards the support of British Indians in Syria. This raised the total limit up to which the Consul at Damascus was empowered to make grants to £1,150 in all. On the 24th October 1932 (P.Z.6854/32 in the bound volume) the G.of I. qualified their agreement to this arrangement by adding a time limitation to the effect that all disbursements had to be brought to account in this Office before the end of March 1934. The Accountant- General in his note of the 14th December below shows that of the extra £150 which had been sanctioned only £61/7/7 was brought to account in the financial year 1933/1934. In view of the G.of I's time limitation the £90 (approximately) which was left outstanding should have been written off from the fund and the account closed. The G.of I«s letter of the 24th October 1932, however, has been overlooked and since March 1934 the sum of £22.9.11 has already been paid and a claim for £11.14.1 has now been preferred by the P.0. Partly owing to the care with which the Consul at Damascus has made his grants, and partly to the falling off in the number of those in need of assistance, the sum which the G.of I. made available in 1932 has lasted considerably longer than was expected either by them or us. Consequently the time limitation imposed by their letter of the 24th October 1932 now appears stringent. It is doubtful whether the Consul at Damascus is aware of it since he is continuing to disburse payments from the fund. It is therefore proposed to suggest to the G.of I. that the time limitation might be waived. 1-^ 6000 7 34 the/1 - 2 - the Q.fo£^r-€bgy&lt;»« -to thi r .,mi ggaatl n^r-tt propose^r^to inform the Consul at Damascus of the amount of money still available in the account and to request him not to exceed it. It is submitted further that in the meantime the payment of £22.9.11 already made since March 1934 should be regularised and that the Accountant-General should be authorised to pay the claim for £11.14.1 which has now been received from the Consul at Damascus.

In accordance with the time limitation imposed in your letter i under reference the fund should then have been closed and the balance of £ 88 . 12. 5 written off. at-Damaocus appears, however, to have overlooked this timre limit and payments amounting to £22.9.11 have been brought to account during the current financial year and a further claim for £11.14.1 has now been submitted by the Consul. As these sums have already been paid by the Consul, the S. of S. in C. has decided to regularise the refund of £22.9.11 already made and has authorised the payment of the further claim for £11.14.1. 2. As the rate at which this fund is ] ! being disbursed has decreased 2800 5000 5.34 considerably/considerably since the date of the Government of India's letter under reference and in view of the ofti^Hneae of the sum remaining in the fund, I am to say that the time limit imposed therein appears to the S* of £ 10 longer appropriate and I am accordingly to suggest, subject to the concurrence of the Government of India, that it should be waived. 3 .
