During his time as Provost AUC transitioned to a three-schools structure, under President Donald McDonald, and Kerek managed the accreditation process and launched initiatives to examine the university’s liberal arts mission.  Kerek discusses issues affecting the faculty at the time, including inequality in compensation between local and relocated hires and the resistance to attempts to impose a retirement age for Egyptian faculty. He describes processes and challenges for faculty recruiting and hiring, research, evaluation, and the tenure and promotion system (including the Provost’s and President’s overruling of committee recommendations). An overview of academic departments and leading faculty and administrators is also provided. Kerek offers his views on AUC students as well, including their socio-economic and religious background, social lives, academic quality, and the level of their English language skills. He comments also on external factors affecting the university, from terrorism in Egypt (including an attack near campus) to the university’s relationship with the Egyptian government (in particular an academic freedom and book censorship issue that arose), as well as AUC’s reputation and standing in Egyptian society.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
