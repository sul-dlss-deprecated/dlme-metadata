OF INFORMATION 1 APR 19VI believe that the difficulty is as you have stated. Nevertheless, there seems to be good evidence that even in the orthodox land of Saudi Arabia the faithful have found no difficulty in over coming the obstacle when it suited them, one device employed being to use something different, e.g., gold, as an intermediate counter in the exchange. Thus, while it was unlawful to exchange 1,000 rupees for 1,000 riyals, it was apparently quite in order to give 1,000 rupees for gold to a corresponding value and then immediately to hand over the latter in exchange for 1,000 riyals. You are already aware of the practical trouble that these alleged scruples have caused in connection with the provision of finance for Saudi Arabia. I notice that a copy of the extract has gone to the Foreign Office, and to the Treasury. Could I also please have a copy for record on our file about Saudi finD.O.No.C/254. Political Agency, Kuwait• 27th March,1942# My v-ear Colonel, Please r call your enquiry when I was in Bahrain in regard to the religious objection of Muslims to purchasing iyals rith Rupees• 2. I have made enquiries here from Saiyid Jawad, a learned Shia divine, and from tl e Punni Judge of the Sharia Court. They are both in agreement that should the coins be of equal weight and of the came metal then it is perfectly la ful for them to be exchanged but if they are not of the same weight though of the same metal then direct transactions are unlawful. 5. I understand that this prescription is inten ea to prevent usu^ry. These learned persons, like many of their mode of life in the West, re.ly on different authorities* I enclose extracts from «Al Kitab ab Jawahir' quoted by Saiyid Ja^ad, and 'Mashkat al Vasabh' referred to by the Sunni Judge. Yours sincerely, sd. T#hickinbotham. The Hon(ble Lt.-Col. .H.Hay,CIB., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at ahrain. Usu£ry is uentioned in the Quran and in Islamic Law# As to the Quran Almighty God has said 'God has allowed trading . nd forbidden usury', but as to Islamic La. tne editor of Al Jav.ahir' has mentioned under the chapter 'Trade' page IBS a correct narra tion from Imam al Sadiq, may peace be upon him, that silver should be exchanged for silver of the s^-me valuelwithout increase or decrease; t e person who charges interest and t &lt;e one who pays it will be in Hell. This ruling relates to coins of the s me kind such as a rupee for a rupee provided that the weight beequ&amp;lj charging extra money on either coin is considered as interest, but the coins be of different kinds such as exchanging of silver for gold or vice versa and the value of one of tuem be more than that of the other the excess amount is not consider d as interest because the coins are of different kinds and it is also permiss ible to exchange one of the two coins w^th nickel or copper coins or with currency notes on profit as it is definitely allowed. The leaned Imam al Khatib si Tabriz!, may Cod bless his soul, has mentioned in his book 'Mishkat al asabih' the follow ing narrati n. 'Abi Said al Hadrami Las stated thet the Prophet of God, may peace be upon him, has g&amp;± srid tdonot sell gold for gold except at f. ce value and the ..eight be equal c^ncl do not give'preference to one upon the other; and do no sell a coin which is not in existence for cash* This is agreed upon'. (copied from ' ,r ishket al Maaabih#, Volume 3, Chapter one about usury, page 308). Abadeh bin al Samit has stated that the Prophet of God has said that gold for gold, silver for silver, heat for heat, barley for barley, dates for dates and salt for salt, shoulc be exeh nged at an equal value and weight from hand to hand, but if the things - be of different kinds you can ; ell them in any way youlike if the transaction be effected from hand to hand.

(a) a continuous stream of gold is being exported from Saudi Arabia to Iraq* and (1)} there is a continuous drain of rupee coins from Bahrain and Kuwait. _ 3. With regard to (a) it must I think be assixued most of the gold exported from Saudi Arabia came originally frciin India in the shape oi remittances in gold made to the Saudi Arabian Govern ment. It is also believed that large quantities of gold are being smuggled out of India mostly from the Kathiawar coast. This smuggled gold probably reaches Iraq direct or via Kuwait and there appears to be no good reason why it should travel via Saudi Arabia 4. The rupee coins which leave Bahrain and Kuwait in such large quantities are it is believed used for the purchase of gold from Saudi Arabia. The situation is such in Kuwait that rupee notes are onjy accepted in the bazaar at a discount of two annas in the rupee. The branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran which has recently been established there but which has not yet been opened 9th February 1942, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. discussed the move 2. The salient facts are as follows:-- 2 - has imported two lakhs of rupee coins. It is feared that when the hank opens this stock of rupees will rapidly he exhausted and the Dank will oe compel led to import more a somewhat serious matter as freight charges eto, on a lakh of rupee coins amount to about Es.3000/-. 5. It is difficult to understand what happens to all the rupee coins which are sent to S&amp;udi Arabia. Their silver content is low and there can be little temptation to hoard them. They are not legal tender in Iraq, and in Saudi Arabia there is a religious taboo based on some passage in the ^uran, about which I hope to obtain more particulars, against their exchange into rials. This taboo does not apply to sovereigns or Iraqi dinars, and when it is necessary to convert rupees into rials or vice versa the exchange is effected through one of these currencies. Over a hundred lorries recently arrived in Kuwait to fetch supplies for Jeadaii, The leader of the convoy brought a draft on a bank in Iraq for 7000 dinars end this was converted into rupees in the Kuwait bazaar, it seems unlikely that the rupee oo^b find their way back to India for the purchase of gold there as notes could be muon more conveniently used for this purpose. A certain number no douot return to Bahrain and Kuwait to pay for comaiodities being exported to Saudi Arabia, but the fact remains that a large proportion of the coins do not return and there is therefore a constant demand for a supply of new rupee ooins to replace them, 6. The action already taken in Bahrain is explained in the first enclosure to this letter. In Kuwait a proclamation has been published prohibiting participation in the smuggling of gold from xnd ia vide the fourth enclosure. An embargo on the export of gold from Kuwait would be ineffective owing tc the impossibility of preventing suoh export by sea and land, and 1 am doubtful also wueLaer an effective check could be placed on the export of rupee ooins, even if the Shaikh were willing to prohibit such export. 7. X find it difficult to understand the implications of these movements of gold and rupees and should be glad to know how the3 r*. th« Government of India view them and whether there ie any further action which they consider might be taken. 8. I am forwarding a copy of this letter and its enclosures to the Secretary of State for India, His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad, His Majesty's Minister, Jeddah and the Political Agents Bahrain and Kuwait.

Bahrain) to meet me on February 28th to discuss generally + the situation which was likely to result from the imposition of 'H* restrictions on the export of gold from Bahrain. The results of our discussions are embodied in the enclosed note dated 1st March 1942. 3, it will be seen from tills note that the confer^ece, in addition to discussing the measures to be taken to prevent the smuggling of gold out of Bahrain, agreed also that some restriction on the export of silver was necessary.

C#C.L. de Grenier, Director of Customs, Bahrein. 1. The Political Agent stated that he wished to prevent gold leaving Bahrein for Iraq as there was likely to be a leakage to Turkey and thence to enemy occupied countries. 2. He considered that any action taxeu to prevent the export of gold from Arabia through Bahrain would tend to divert the export route from Bahrain to Kuwait because the route the gold was taxing was Aratli. to Iraq, via Bahrain or Kuwait, and thence to Turkey. 3. The Political Agent foresaw that if the issue of exoort licences was curtailed ther* would be a great increase in tbs smuggling of gold and he invitee the co-operation of the Bahrain Government in preventing this. He pointed out that there were adequate penalties under the law to penalise offenders. 4. The Adviser considered that no harm would be done to Bahrain interests by the prevention of this gold traffic; the only persons affected would be one or two bullion brokers who were Iraqi subjects. 5. Mr. Gunn, Manager of the Eastern Bank, stated that the export of gold aa such from Bahrain did not affect his bank. He was more interested in preventing the flow of rupee silver out of Bahrain. This was exported from Bahrain to pay for the gold finding Its wey from Baud! Arabia into Iraq. Bupee notes not being accepted in Arabia large quant1 ties of rupee coin were being drained from Bahrain leaving only /- 2 rup«e notes* 8* The prevention of smuggling was next discussed* The problem was considerod to be practically confined to preventing export to Kuwait by countrycraft f but to be paeulierly difficult owing to the physical features of the inland of Bahrain. 7- The Director of Customs considered that one of the main difficulties in convicting smugglers was the fact that smugglers could afford to pay large bribes to the customs guards whereas the rewards for obtaining convictions in the courts were inadequate* He argued that the courts should, es £ matter of practice, ordinarily award half the fine; levied on convicted smugglers as a reward to the per sons apprehending them. The Political Agent agreed to instruct the Agency courts, and the Adviser the Bahrein courts, rccordingly* 3. Further practical measures were considered to be increased activity by the Bahrain police launch patrol round the coasts of the islnnd, end of the mounted police patrol on the north west shores or the island; coupled with arrangements with Kuwait for the search of ships on arrival from Bahrein* 9# The export of silver to Kuwait and Iraq was next con sidered. The Political Agent stated that he did not wish to prohibit the export entirely but to limit it to the amount required for the finance of bona fide trade only* .Export of silver to Iraq was eonoidered to be unnecessary. Iraq does not recognise rupee currency and trade transac tions can be paid for through the Eastern Bank. The con ference agreed that permission for the export of rupee silver to Iraq should not be given. The trade between Kuwait and Bahrain which required rupee silver currency was considered to be very son11, And Mr. Ounn agreed to assist the Agency in determining what applications for rupee /rupea curr»ar*;y for Kuwait wure required for the finance of fide trade* i 10* The Political Agent axpreaeed his thanks to the con ference for their valuable aasistance and the conference adjourned. 3utt/xiftry of action agreod upon s- (1) Increased activity by Bahrain Police patrols to prevent smuggling* (2&gt; iialf of fines inflicted cn smugglers to be given as rewards to those bringing about their arrest* ( 3 ) Intiiiiation of sailings cf countrycraft to be sent to Kuwait for search on arrival.

The gold is not necessarily landed here as the market price may be more favourable in Basra and the merchant who owns the con signment may direct the craft to proceed there. 3.

However I feel that semp announcement by Your Highness that y xir subjects were to j refrain from in any way engaging in the traffic in gold with India and that all imports of gold by sea must be declared to the Customs Authorities here on pain of confiscation if the order is not complied with would help materially the Indian Customs Authorities in their difficult task of enforcing the orders of the Government of India.Copy of Letter No. E/6/1683 dated 9th v ehruary 1943 from Tr .H. the jiuler of Kuwait, t receipt of your Excellency's letter.'To. 26- 8/2 of 7-2-4i regarding the smuggling of gold.
