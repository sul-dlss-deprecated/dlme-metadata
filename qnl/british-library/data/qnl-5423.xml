These craft were meetly river tugs utterly unsuited for open sea work* and Col.Dickson was nearly drowned in one and Col.Barrett in another* *uth the advent of motor launches* however* a new era began ,nd one was purchased for Bandar Abbas at e cost of £.3000/-* This* however* proved unsatisfactory# m it hrd evidently been designed for the Thfluaee estuary, and it was far too saail in relation to its parch se pr«ce. It was a em&amp;ller edition of this type that was recommended for fair weather use in Muscat in 1920. later twenties saw the introduction of a new type oi launch to the Gulf* the motor dhow, they consisted of a dhow body with an imported engine# usually Kelvin* and carried a mast and sail as an insurance against mechanical breakdown. The hull was half as expensive as an nglieh type hull *itn its superior finish* and being made ox local materials could be maintained by local labour* ^nd did not require docking or indeed any attention beyond the application of *m rk oil. Having no steam engine, the cost of upsee^ was very greatly reduced and the range w*e increased.

Capt*Hieitiaboth&amp;gi has not mentioned It in his letter, tut he performed a ht.sardoue journey to 3ur in a hired launch which broke down and left him rolling off an open shore for 24 hours. Had a atom blown up he would have been drowned. On another occasion he went by rowboat from Dibeh to Lisah, spending seven hours at sec in an open boat, in p*st, olitical have n&amp;tur lly preferred to remain i*t Muscat and rely on cn occasional warenip for their transport. The war h*e, however, changed all this, Sloope are no longer available, and the necessity for political supervision and the protection of eenttered B itieh communities i fi greatly enhanced* In addition, we are constantly being urged to tasc un active part againet the elcvc trade without, however, bain, given the means to combat it. The political gent must be able to tour to every portion of hie charge, ana we cannot allow him to be immobilised at Muscat, the vessel is required for long Journeys in thr open sea ana what is wanted is a motor dhow larger than the Bushire launch and strongiy/political Hesident in the x-erai an Gulf etrongly built *ith a Shat nnd sail and at least s 50 H,?. eiogine.

Political Agency &amp; H.B.M's Consulate, (3 ^uacat, the 20th February 1940 From Captain T.Hickinbotham, Political Agent d H.B.M’a Conaul Muscat* To The Handle the Political Heaident^ in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir I have the honour to draw your attention to the need for the provision of a powerful and strongly built launch for this Agency. This question has been raised on more than one occasion in the past and the provision of a launch has been recommended to the Government of India by the Political Resident but unfortunately questions of finance and the division of expenditure on Consular establishments have not made it possible for the Resident's recommendations to be carried out. I propose to show that the need for a launch, about which there has never been any doubt, has increased greatly and that owing to modem improvements in marine engines the initial expenditure involved and the annual maintenance charges will be much less than they would have been in the days of steam launches. Quriyat and in the Batinah towns. These British Indian subjects are for the most part Hindus who are engaged in trading oper ations. The sise of these colonies varies from fifty-four Hindus at Bur to three or four at Shinaa. It is essential that the Political Agent keep in touch with these traders with a /low to helping them in their trading operations and assisting * There are colonies of British Indian subjects at Bur, / them when■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ them when, as not infrequently occurs, some difficulty arises between the traders and the local governor. 3. Should unrest occur due to tribal disorder resulting from internal causes or from the Jtfuscat Government*s friendly attitude to His Majesty*s Government it will be more important .an ever that the &lt; olitical Agent be in a position to reach the outlying Hindu communities in the quickest possible time. They are the persons of moat substance in the towns and this fact combined with the fact of their not being Muslims will render them liable to serious molestation once the Sultan*s authority cea»ea to exist. In time of danger the presence of the Political Agent always has an excellent effect and serves to hearten the British Indian subjects while acting as a deterrent u0 recalcitrant tribesmen. extreme cases the Political Agent must be in a position to evacuate the British Indian subjects to a place of safety. grant of an Oil Concession to Petroleum Concessions wxini s^ed has already resulted in survey work being carried out by parties of British and American subjects. Further survey work is to be carried out and the presence of these parties with the possibility of considerable development should oil be found in commercial quantities makes it desirable for the Political Agent to oe in a position to be able to keep in close touch with the situation in order to render such assistance to the Company and its employees as may be necessary* 5. During 133B cases of slave trading occurred on the Batinah Coast. The economic situation in Iranian Mekran resulted in extreme poverty among the poorer classes and Mekranis emigrated to Muscat territory. A percentage of these emigrants became slaves and were sent into the interior of Arabia. Owing to the physical configuration of the Batinah Coast it is very difficult for the Muscat Government to put / into3 into opera !..ion rea-liy ef'f’ect.ive measuz'Qs Tor the pi*6vention of slavery. The Political Agent has co-operated with the Muscat Government to the fullest possible extent and experience has shown P that his visits to areas known to be occupied by persona, who, if not actually engaged in the trade, were certainly acquiescent, in the use of their territory by traders, have had an excellent psychological affect. Thequally good weather experienced during the late summer, autumn and winter of last year made la nd touring possible. Although the trade in slaves has now csased in the Batinah it is probable that economic conditions in Iran combined with the opportunities for employment during the Batinah “ ate ie ' ;l£ ' ,on ''ill result in a recurrence of slavery in the coming ' : ' wwer * Should political and climatic conditions not be favour able it will not be possible for the Political Agent with the present means of transport at his disposal to help the itusoat Government to the extent which is desirable. 5. There are no all weather roada in lAiscat and Oman. Motorable tracks exist from Muscat to Shinaa in the north ana from Muscat to iuriyat in the east. These tracks are very difficult under ideal climatic conditions and become quite impossible after rain. There is no road to 3ur and the only means of communi cation with this important town is by sailing boat or by camel. The journey by sea is dependant on favourable weather conditions n ana the Journey by camel takes four days of hard travelling. i to the political disposition of tribal arsas it ■vould no. be possible to reach Sur by land ahould tribal unrest make the Political Agent's presence there essential for the protection of the British Indian subjects. For the same reason the Political Agent t.c. i i would certainly be cut off by land from the towns in the Batinah. The only fora of transport which will not be rendered inoperative by unrest among the tribee le a powerful launch. The occurrence of strong winds and rough seas during six months of the / year makes4 y©ai* aakec &amp;e&amp; travel unpleasant and on occasion dangerous* Th&amp; diinger can be reduced to a minimum by providing a sufficiently large and well engined vessel* The strongly constructed Hu) y 0 f y * 1 recommend that a launch similar to one now being used by Petroleum Concessions Limited at Bahrain should be provided* The vessel should have an overall length of not less than sixty- live feet and the motive power should be provided by a Diesel engine of at least fifty hoarse power. The cost of such a launch would be in the neighbourhood of He. 15,000. a crew of five persons including a skilled engineer will be required. Owing to the economy of a Diesel engine I anticipate that the annual running co^t of the vessel including the pay of the crew and up-keep charges will not amount to more than tts. 7,000* teak built dhow type of craft is sfr&amp;k, ideal for the weather onditions prevailing in the Gulf and also has the merit of being inexpensive* S. 1 I have the honour to be, Sir, four most obedient servant Sd./ T.Hickinbotham* ^‘®P^^ld,X*A*j Political Agent H*B* s Consul, MuscatCONFIDENTIAL . «o.

To r rhe Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject * *• Launch idr the Muscat /y^enev . Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter Ho. C/127 dated the 20th February 1940. 2 * men I was informed that the Imperial Airways liner RannibJ^ was overdue at Sharjah and had been last heard of over the sea between Jask and the Musandum Peninsula, I realised that it wct£&gt; of the utmost importance that the northern portion of the Batinah Joast should be searched without delay and that the inhabitants oi the coastal villages should be warned to keep a careful watch for survivors or wreckage. The most expeditious and the most effective way of carrying out this task would have been to send a reliable launch up the coast with instructions to carry out a very careful search of the area opposite to the place where the plane was last heard of, to warn the coastal villages, and to give instructions to the northern Governors to send search parties inland. Unfortunately the Agency has no launch. The only power vessel afloat in Muscat waters, an ancient converted dhow with a worm eaten hull and unreliable petrol paraffin motor belonging to a Matrah merchant which only dare leave harbour in the calmest of weather,was away at bur* some hundred miles to the west of Fuseat. i was thus forced to send messages to thep Governors by land and abandon any idea of a coastal search. Fortunately my messenger’s motor car was able to reach iiohar two hours before a heavy fall of rain made the track up the Batin&amp;h Coast impossible for four days. 3* Unfortunately as wa now know all efforts to find ma rescue the paasengera and crow of the plan«B were unavailing but I think tha^v it only ri^ht to point out that had the pZ«ne qoixq down near the Batinah Coast and had the passengers remained on the plane or got ashore the availability of a launch at ifuaeat would have made all the difference between quick rescue and considerable suffering and hardship.

Extract from letter from The Residency, Bushire to J.P.Gibson, Esq.., dated the 31st July 1940. 4. At the moment the trade is at a low ebb, but it will require the constant supervision of the Political Agent to see that it remains so. The suppression of the slave trade arouses much sympathy, but little actual support, in fact it is actually considered to be sufficient for the Navy to 'do' something. The Navy are no longer available, and a little practical help would be welcome. In the first place the Political Agent must keep in close touch and be fully informed and to do this he must tour this coast frequently, which he can only do in a launch. For forty years the attempts of this Residency to secure a seagoing launch for Muscat have struck on the reefs of ’'financial stringency' and the rocks of 'Allocation of consular expenditure in the Persian Gulf' (except for a brief interlude after the War when Muscat enjoyed the service of a derelict steam tug), but yet another effort is now being made. If we are to tackle this trade seriously the Political Agent must be given every facility for frequent touring for it is only by this means that he will know what is going on and it is only then that we may hope to rid the Batineh of its sinister reputation.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000096_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3588</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000096</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3588</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/29(3) 'Muscat: launches'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1940/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-15T11:33:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (34 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 36; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the proposal to replace the engine of the Persian Gulf Residency motor launch.The file is composed of correspondence between the Foreign Office, the Government of India, and Bergius Company Ltd.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Launches</topic></subject><subject><topic>British</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000096#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
