My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship’s Political despatch !No. 48, dated the 30th June 1911, regarding free registra - tion of poor British Indian subjects in the Baghdad Vilayat. The vie°ws of the Government of India are invited as to the reply which should be returned to the enquiry made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to what steps should be taken to ascertain in each case the inability of such persons to pay the fee, before granting registration gratis. 2. After consulting our Political Besident in Turkish Arabia we are of opinion that it would be sufficient if the registering Consular Officer, before granting free registration, were to hold an enquiry into the property, means of livelihood, number of family, and general circumstances of the applicant, and reduce the result of his investigations to writing. He might also be required to enter on the certificate of registration itself, in the place where the stamp is ordinarily affixed, the words “ Gratis after due enquiry ”, followed by his signature, as proof of a proper investigation having been held.

Since my appointment to Bagdad more than a year ago 1 have devoted close personal attention to the registration of British subjects specially Indians, in my consular jurisdiction. I regret to say that the knowledge gained tends to show that the legistiation of British Indians here is as yet very incomplete. The number of British subjects of Indian descent settled in this country is ic icw'd to be not less than three thousand, inclusive of women and c 11 dien , but the number of registration certificates issued in 1910 was onfy 243 at this Consulate-General and 279 at the Karbala Vice- Lonsulate. Many of these were taken by heads of families and included more peisons than one; but many on the other hand, were granted to solitaiy individuals; and a number of course, were on account of British subjects of other than Indian descent. 11091. A g(il { Cm \ • ■ * Some efforts which I have made in the direction of compulsory registration indicate that, to' enforce it, an army of Qawwasses would be required, and im prisonment must be resorted to for the recovery of many fees and fines. Regis tration would in these circumstances become odious instead of being regarded as a privilege. All means have been tried, including severity, to induce British Indians to register themselves more generally, :i: ' but without avail ; and I am inclined to think that the principal cause of their back wardness is the registration fee, small though it is, of 2s. Cd. Indians of the lower class are apt to be extremely parsimonious even when they have some money ; and there is no doubt that a large proportion of the Indian settlers here are really paupers, without a farthing to spend. The incomplete registration of British Indians is nevertheless a regrettable circumstance, especially in view of the jealousy with which extra-territorial jurisdiction is now regarded by Turkish officials, and of the difficulties which are liable to arise from this state of feeling. In practice it is impossible to refuse Consular assistance to an unregistered British subject who applies for it, as he seldom fails to do when he finds that it will be useful, at the eleventh hour; and the recent date of the certificate of registration granted in such a case must, if it conies to notice, make an unfavourable impression on the mind of the Turkish authorities. It is also inconvenient that the actual number of British subjects in this country should also be so uncertain as it is. I therefore venture to suggest, with much respect, that His Majesty’s Secretary of State might be moved to declare, under Article 157 of the Ottoman Order in Council, 1910, that the fee for the registration of indigent British subjects of Asiatic descent in the Baghdad Wilayat shall be nil, their indigence being first established to the satisfaction of the Consular authority granting them registration.

At present they neglect to do so, not because of laziness or indifference to their duty, because they are mostly workless paupers, and if some of them have a small profession they can hardly get their own living, still less to pay the fee of a certificate. The free registra tion would, therefore, be a great boon to them and they would appreciate it most heartily.

Mr. Marlinq to Sir Edward (Iren.—[Received November 28.) (No. 843.) Sir, Per a, November 23, 1910. WITH reference to your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October and Sir Gerard Lowthers despatch No. 797 of the 31st October concerning the arbitrary and aggressive proceedings of the Ottoman local authorities in Bagdad and Bussorah, I have the honour to enclose paraphrases of two telegrams from His Majesty’s consul at Bagdad, reporting that the property numbered No. 6 in his despatch No. 42 of the 5th September has been demolished under circumstances of injury and insult, that the authorities had given notice of their intention to expropriate part of Messrs. Lynch’s head offices at a price little more than a third of that estimated by their local manager, that it is rumoured locally that the temporary permission to tow harges given in 1899 is about to be withdrawn, and that the general effect produced on British subjects was so deplorable that some of them—presumably Indian Moslems—were actually becoming Ottoman subjects mainly owing to the apparent inability of the British authorities to afford them proper protection. Mr. Lorimer also expresses the opinion that the Bagdad municipal loan should not be entrusted to the present local Government, or in any case should not be given until the question of compensation to British subjects has been settled. I have further just received a written unofficial communication from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, complaining that Lynch’s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad or Bussorah. As regards the demolitions, Sir Gerard Lowther in his telegram No. 246 of the 11th instant reported to you that the Minister of the Interior had practically decided to indemnify the owners for their losses, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave me a similar assurance again yesterday morning. The Minister of the Interior has, moreover, declared that the Government has decided to pay such indemnities “ should it be proved that the regulations on the subject have been contravened.” In reply to the remark that after the buildings were removed it was difficult to prpve that they were not in a dangerous state before demolition, he replied that there had also been numerous strong complaints from natives whose property had been similarly treated, that the matter might come up in Parliament, that one of the Bagdad committee deputies had received secret instructions to investigate the whole affair, that his conclusions seemed most damaging to the vali, that both native and foreign subjects would have to be indemnified, and that all his (the Minister’s) colleagues were in favour of recalling Nazim Pasha. General Nazim Pasha has the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian, and is rather the type of a blunt soldier who is ignorant, as his recent methods at Bagdad have shown, of the niceties of civil administration. As you are aware, he has been an opponent of the committee, and early in 1909 was suddenly appointed Minister of War by Kiamil Pasha, with the idea of compelling the officers to cease dabbling in politics. This excited the fierce anger of the committee, who promptly brought about the violent and unconstitutional fall of the Grand Vizier and his new A\ ar Minister. Again, after the mutiny of the 13th April, 1909, Nazim Pasha incurred the displeasure of the committee by accepting the post of commander of the mutinous Constantinople army corps, which he reduced to order, and advocated punishing without the interven tion of the Macedonian forces. Being popular with the rank and file his presence in the capital was irksome to the committee, who apparently resolved to send him to the distant post of Bagdad, with the ulterior object of ruining his reputation and dismissing him as a failure. It is not impossible that Nazim Pasha’s arbitrary methods of improving Bagdad were indirectly suggested to him by some member of the committee with a view to compassing his downfall’, and it seems undoubted that they would like to be able to say that his recall was due to the English, to whom Nazim was reputed to be friendly. It is on this account that in our written and verbal complaints about the recent high-handed proceedings at Bagdad this embassy has been careful to omit any mention of his name, and to refer always to “ the local authorities or ‘‘ the Bagdad [2988 ee —1]municipality.” There seems little douht now that Nazim Pashas tenure of office at Bagdad will not last long. With reference to Mr. Lorimer’s suggestion that steps might be taken to defer the conclusion of the Bagdad municipal loan, I do not see how, in view of recent events, the embassy could approach the National Bank with that object. As regards the expropriation of Messrs. Lynch s head offices, I have caused the/ Minister of the Interior to telegraph to the vali to see that the provisions of the Expropriation Law are not departed from, and informed Mr. Lorimer that, unless the authorities offer a reasonable price, Messrs. Lynch’s agent should, if necessary, bring an action within fifteen days, as prescribed. I have further had the Minister of the Interior’s attention drawn to the threatened withdrawal of Messrs. Lynch’s permission to tow barges, and to the fact that the existing accumulation of cargo at Bussorah makes it very inopportune to raise the question at the present moment. In view of the present frame of mind of the Turkish authorities, they would not now be likely to entertain the suggestion in Messrs. Lynch’s letter of the 21st October and that of the 10th November, 1910, enclosed in your despatches Nos. 335 and 346 of the 31st October and the 15th November respectively, that they should be allowed to use a fourth steamer to help to work off the congestion at Bussorah. In the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s letter of the 10th November it is stated that Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery has been granted a permit to run steamers between Bagdad and Bussorah, and that this gentleman is understood to be in close touch with the agents of the German Hamburg-Amerika line. At first sight it is difficult to see why Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Bagdad should not be in as close if not closer touch with Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery. The communication from the Porte complaining that Messrs. Lynch’s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad and Bussorah seemed to contest the right of the original two steamers to carry the British flag. I at once caused energetic representations to be made on the subject, with the result that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs now declares that probably the local authorities confounded the two original steamers with the third steamer, for which permission was granted in January 1907, with the proviso that it should fly the Ottoman flag, and that their complaints refer only to alleged “ irregularities ” of the third steamer. As regards the decision prohibiting the registration of Sheikh Kazal’s lands at Failieh, the Porte has hinted that representations on the subject would more properly come from the Persian Embassy here, but has promised to re-examine the matter. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to try and arrange that the sheikh’s agent should move the new vali at Bussorah to again refer the matter to Constantinople for reconsideration. In a telegram of the 14th November, His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah reported from Bushire that the “ Bedbreast ” had visited Wakra and Odeid and found no sign of Turkish mudirs at those places, while, as reported in my telegram No. 248 of the 14th instant, His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire has since reported the desertion of the Turkish post at Zakhnuniyeh. I would venture to suggest, for your consideration, the advisability of sending the “Redbreast” to Zakhnuniyeh to ascertain whether any Turkish gendarmes are still there, and whether, as previously reported, the Turkish flag is still at the bottom of the mast. The visit of a British ship is certain to he reported, and its importance magnified by the local Arabs up to Bussorah and Bagdad, and its effect may counteract to a certain extent the deplorable impression among British subjects at Bagdad caused by the high-handed action of the Turkish local authorities. The fact that this despatch is a report on some of the questions forming the subject of your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October must be my excuse for including in it more than one subject-matter. I have, &amp; £ HARLEg m MA rlING. Enclosure 1 in No, 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther, (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 12, 1910. REFERRING to my telegram of the 8th instant and to your Excellency s telegram of the 10th instant, I regret to report that British reputation at Bagdad has fallen to a' ' 1 v_ 3 very low ebb, and I find that British subjects are seriously alarmed, seeing that their rights have never hitherto been so trampled upon here. For four months past they have been suffering from illegal oppression, from which there is no sign of any redress to come visible. A prosperous merchant, Abdul Ali, has talked of renouncing his British nationality for Turkish, and several British Indians have actually done so. If I ^ have so far failed to show your Excellency the serious nature of the situation, it has e ' been only because I was unwilling to appear alarmist. The vali is incompetent, and under the influence of unscrupulous and ignorant underlings, and it is with regret that I am reduced to the conviction that he must be removed and replaced by a more intelligent man. Yesterday they demolished part of the two storied building, No. 6, with circum stances of injury and insult, and have continued doing so to-day. The violence of the local authorities increases daily, and I can only conclude the Minister of the Interior is misleading your Excellency. The vali appears to treat the question as a personal one, and the next thing will be expropriations, which will cause great and as yet unforeseen losses to British subjects if carried out on the same lines as the demolitions. Could your Excellency not obtain compensation in even one case ? It would to some extent allay the panic. Immediate payment to the ice manufacturer, whose case is clear, would effect this purpose. The Bagdad municipality loan should not, I think, be entrusted to the present local Government, or, at any rate, not given till the amount of compensation payable to British subjects for the demolitions and prospective expropriations has been discussed and approved by His Majesty’s Embassy. The loan will certainly be misspent, and the city will thus be saddled to no purpose with a heavy debt for a generation. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 14, 1910. REFERRING to my telegram of the 12th November last, I anticipate that I shall soon learn that a block of lofty houses owned by some Indian nawabs, to which I did not refer in my despatch of the 5th September last, will have been expropriated on scandalously unfair conditions. Meanwhile, notice has been sent to Lynch’s manager of the expropriation of 3|- metres from the front of his office and warehouse, the expropriation to take effect in fifteen days, and compensation being fixed at 424 Turkish liras only. The unscrupulous character of the proceedings is shown by the fact that Lynch’s manager estimates the cost of rebuilding on a new alignment would amount to some 1,184 liras, while the estimate made in my despatch of the 5th September came to 1,250 liras. The total claim made by Lynch amounts to 2,396 liras, i.e., for buildings which will now be expropriated 1,828 liras, for wall and shops wrongfully demolished 568 liras, though there is perhaps room for discussion regarding the items of the cost of recon struction. I fear that a grave blow would be struck at British prestige, from which it will not easily recover, if Lynch’s office and warehouse are destroyed and no proper compensation first fixed. It is absolutely necessary that the vilayet’s proceedings should be checked, and the view is gaining ground here that the British Government cannot protect its subjects in Turkey.Immediate and Confidential. tT». tCMlt The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed' by the Secretary of State to transmit the accompanying copies of jf telegram $, as marked in the Foreign Office, j v rfC oaf id eat ia 1 Ho G From The Assistant Secretary to the Gorernment of India in the Foreign Deitortraent t To The Volition 1 Heaident in Turkish Arabia.

The action of the Political Resident, Bag! dad, is still governed by those orders and by a Circular, dated 12th hay 1890, from H.B.k’s Ambassador at Constantinople, The principal direction conveyed in the Circular is as follows:- Tf You are hereby instructed to extend to Subjects of 'the Ameer sojourning in the Ottoman firpire unofficial 'countenance and protection whenever needed. Such protec tion would not give them the right to claim the benefit 'of the Capitulationsbetween Great Britain and Turkey out 'it would entitle them as British protected persons to 'receive British passports and to have the aid and support ' of Her Majesty’s Consular officers in any difficulties whi chVihioh th*y rai{?it har« v/lth th« Ottoman 'Authorities'. instructicna of the GovernBient of India tni 0x ix * ^ ls iteOassAior are in perfect harmony, ana they • a. c Cj.et.r # hut cii'cun stances have changed SLince they vere issu.ea. In the first place it aey he taken as certain t f should u c ( ntenticv-o ci se ri 1,21 Anglian subject arise in this province, the Turkish authorities would, in their present temper, decline to admit the good offices of a British Consular Officer on his behalf, and that the Afghan subject 1 s case \rouid consequently be disposed cf in the sane uanuer as if he were e Turkish subject. in the second place the new Ottoman Order in Council, that of 1910, lays it deux (Art 3) that the term 'British subject' includes 'British protected persona'. In the IjfoasL; Circular of 1690 the subject a of tie Anil of Afghanistan are foe scribed as 'British protected persons' and it might therefore be held that under the Ottoman Order in Council, 1910, they should now in Turkey be \ registered as British subjects (Art. 152 of the Order). \ 4. Though unwilling to raise a delicate point, I feel that I must solicit guidance on this difficult andimportant natter, I not infrequently receive applications fron subjects of the Aair to be registered as British subjects and these I have been accustomed to refuse, at the same time promising my good offices if occasion should require. 1 an not sure, however, that the refusal of registration is legal under the Order of 1910; and I have every reason to fear that ny promise of good offices, if brought to a practical test, migfrt prove an illusive guarantee. Bo critical case of an ±- Afghan subject has ommrred since py appointment at Baghdad but I under the impression from their general attitude that the local Turkish authorities are not aware that the British claim in regard to Afghan subjects has been limited in the past to the exercise of good offioes t If the Turkish authorities were to ask me categorically what the position is,- arid they have already once sounded me on the subject,- I should not know how to answer them. 5. To offer advice to Government in a question o* such far-reaching significance is beyond the province of a local officer like myself; but I may be allowed to state the fallow- lag oonsiaeratioaa, though possibly erroneous which hove occurredoccurred to ilq (a) If the conduct of the foreign relations of the Afiir of Afghanistan is in the hands of the British Government, the protection of the Anir'a subjects abroad would in ordinary cirouastances devolve on the representatives of. Britain, at least in planes where the Aair Maintained no accredited representative of his own* acquiesce in a different aysteit would apparently be to renounce, in an important respect, the rights of political suzerainty over the Aair; and the failure to assert one of those rights could, be used by the opponents of Britain as an argument in any controversy that night arise regarding the international status of Afghanistan* (b) On the other hand, if the right of Britain to protect Afghan subjects abroad were to be asserted by the British Government and denied by the Amir hiaself, serious inconveniences night result, such as the appointment by the Anifc of representatives of his own, at Baghdad and elsewhere, who claimed to deal directly with the Govern- nent of the country* 6 . I vw&lt;y be allowed to point out, without presuming to sake any suggestion as to what should be done, that it nightA oe feaaible, vritliout reference to the Awir, to register luii protect aa British subjects uuy lepeuieuta o* His Afghan Majesty v’dio shouii of their own notion apply for such registra* tion and protection. If this were done quietly and without objection during a considerable tine a good prescriptive position night be eatablishecl; but it ie of course t iiapossible to know whet line the Turkish authorities would take if their attention should be attracted to the natter* 7. In conclusion I would once more disdain the wish to raise aa embarrassing questton, which I hare in fact refrained from referring to Government for so long as I ventured. The circums tances of the time, however are inch aa uta^ at any moment bring the status of Afghans in Turkish Arabia under discussion; and the iolitical Resident at Baghdad should be in a position, in case of thia happening, to assume a clear and decided attitude which he knows to be in accordance math the policy of the Government of India and of His Majesty'a Government. 8 . a copy of this letter and of the Government of India's letter quoted in the first paragraph have been forwarded to H, B.

In your diary for the week ending the 27th April 1904,you report that Pathans and Afghans ( or what used to be called tr&amp;ns-frontier men) object very much to register themselves as British subjects and that you have not thought it necessary to compel them to do so. You add that their contention is that they are subjects of the Amir and of no one else,but that when they get into trouble with the Turkish authorities,they some times seek your protect ion and you are awaiting such opportuni ties to protect them and secure their registration. 2. The question of the protection in Turkish Arabia of subjects of Sative States in India,has been raised in the cor respondence ending with your letter Ho. 24, da ted the 7 th January \ 1904,and I am to forward.for your inf or rant ion, a copy of a das- petoh which has been addressed to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India on the subject, ffith reference to the last peragraph of the despatch,! am to observe that the position of V; \ subjectssubjects of the Amir is different fro« that of Rubjects of Tteti , ?e rjtntea in Indula t end the! unless or until Hia Highness ftsks us to extend the protect ion of our H.inisters and ConBular Offloera abroad ^ to bis Bubjeotn,instead of their good offices a lone t it is not advisable to olaim the right to giant that protect ion. The Government of India recognize the deeirrbility of ntandiag forth as the repre sentatives abroad of Af^ian into rests, and everything possib le should be done to encourage this attitude. At the s&amp;me time, it is feared that no ;;oo&amp; would result from addressing the Amir at the present moment,and inviting him to aooOrd his forme 1 ooncurreaoe to the representation of his stbjecti in foreign territory by our Diplomatio and Consular Offi cers. His Highness would probably find some exouse for refusing to give his consent even to an arrangement so beneficial to his own people. In the opinion of the Govern ment of India,therefore,it will suffice if British Consular Officers in Turkish Arabia extend their good offices to all Afghans who may apply for them.

There are, I believe, a considerable number of Baluchis at Basra, both from British Baluchistan and from the territories in that district under our politi cal control. I do not however extend British protec tion to Baluchis who fail to register themselves at this Consulate. I have not so far received any suc cessful applications for registration and, at the present time, there are no Baluchis registered at the Consulate. The Vali, judging by the notification enclosed, is evidently under a misapprehension regarding our C. M. Marling, Esq., C.M.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. TreatyTreaty engagements with the nine important divisions of Baluchistan, comprised hy:- 1. Kalat. 2. Sarawan and Jhalawan, lying to the north and south of Kalat respectively. 3.

The country inhabited by the Marri and Bugti tribes along the Punjab and Sind borders. 8. British Baluchistan. 9. The Bori, Zhob, Chagai and Sinjeran country. Of these divisions Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are under our political control. Bolan (No. 3) is administered by the Kalat political agency and the remaining districts under (3) form part of the agency territories, which are administered by the Governor General's Agent, along with the tracts enumerated under Nos. 7 and 9. I think, under the circumstances, that the Vali should receive some official intimation of the political statusstatus of these countries and should he directed to admit our intervention on hehalf of such natives of them as register themselves in the ordinary way at the British Consulate at Basra. Such registration could of course only he effected here provided the applicant produced satisfactory evi dence in support of his claim to British protection, as is laid down in Section 11, Chapter XXVII, page 263 of the General Consular Instructions regarding Asiatics I have deferred taking any official action in the matter pending the receipt of your instructions.

Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you, to be laid before Viscount Morley, a copy of a note from the Turkish Ambassador, enquiring as to the status in the Ottoman Dominions of natives of Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and also of other States coterminous with India. \ I am to refer to paragraph 7 of the despatch from the Government of India enclosed in your letter of July 7th, 1904, and to the last paragraph of the despatch addressed to them on June 23rd, 1905, a copy of which accompanied your letter of June 26th, 1905, on the subject of the national status in Turkey of subjects of the Native States in India, and to request that Sir Edward may be favoured with any observations which Viscount Morley may desire to offer as to the re ply© ^ (996/09) reply which should he returned to the Turkish Ambas sador* s note. Sir Edward thinks that, in the circumstances, it would he best to explain to Rifaat Pasha the status of the various countries literally coterminous with Gulf, and to inform His Excellency that the natives of those States are, when outside their limits deemed by His Majesty's Government to be British Protected Persons I am Sir, Your most obedient humble ServantT^f O Cj I &amp; memorandum. vp ^ &amp;nera ^ subject is governed by the decision fr.23 Jl^*, 'crs of 1905 when, a question of the nature of the protection to be given to subjects of Native States having arisen at Bagdad, the Foreign Office laid down in Circulars, dated 22 May 1905, to Diplomatic and Consular Officers Abroad that 'The same measure of protection may properly be extended to British- protected persons abroad as to British subjects' except m so far as the exercise of such protect ion would be inconsistent with 'treaty, agreement , or statutory enactment '; and that as regards the Ottoman dominions there is nothing to prevent British-protected persons being placed on the same footing as British subjects in the mdtter of jurisdiction. The effect of this decision was to place subjects of Native States in the same position as Bri t ish-Indian subj ects. Our despatch of the 23 June 1905 agreed with the view of the Government of India that it was neither necessary nor desirable to enter into formal agreements with the Native States as to the exercise by us of rights of protection over Native States subjects; and that there was no need 'at present' to raise the question of Afghanistan, in respect of which the Government of India had expressed the view that a formal agreement might be^ecessary. In accordance with this decision the Foreign Office now issue passports to subjects of Native States, in the same terms as those issued to Brit ish-bom l/® . to y.O. /qo&lt;. subjectsAs regards the specific enquiry of the Turkish Government Baluchistan is described in the Gazetteer as being divided into (l) British Baluchistan, consisting of tracts assigned to the British Government by treaty in 1879, (2) the Agency territories, composed of tracts which habe been from time to time acquired by lease or otherwise,, brought under control and been placed directly under British officers, and (3) the Native States of Kalat and Las pela. The whole of the country thus falls within the definitions of 'British India' or India, as given in the Interpretation Act of 1889 (52 and 53 Vietcap^ 63, sec*18, viz:- 'The expression British India shall mean all 'territories within II*M* dominions which are for the 'time being governed by His Majesty through the '&gt;oovem — {JTy U wJyL 'General of 'Thdid)or other officer subordinate to 'the Governor General of India. 'The expression India shall mean British India 'together with any territories of any Native Prince 'or Chief under the suzerainty of His Majesty 'exercised through the Governor General ofindia^ or 'other officer subordinate to the Governor General 'of India. ' These definitions cover not only Baluchistan, but all the various territories on the North West border between the 'administrative' and 'external' frontiers. It seems impracticable in view of the decision of 1905 to draw any distinction between one class and another of the inhabitants of these territories according to the political status of the territory they^^L+%A^Lirv&gt;i t-~~ fl*J. ^ tL~t^s\^'f cx , tt* they inhabit, and to lay down that some are entitled to protection n and others to 'good offices' only. The proper way of protecting ourselves is by refusing protection abroad to applicants not provided with passports or certificates granted by competent ^ British autho rities. In this connection, reference may be made to the letter from the G-overrment of India to the Legation of Bangkok of 9 March 1907, enclosing a list of 'K&amp;L. ^ So ^JOV t. A* •'tj ^ ftterritories, natives of which should be registered ari(jL gi veri consular protection under the terns of the Agreement of 1899 with Siam, which recognised (jArticle ' the registration of 'all persons of 'Asiatic descent bo in within the Queen 9 s dominions 'or born within the territory of any Prince or State 'in India under the suzerainty of or in alliance with 'the Queen'. It may also be u&gt;or}h noting that as regards Kashgar, the Government of India instructed the Special Assistant in 1903 (before the decision of 1905) that 'good offices may be employed, on behalf 'of any person who is a Native of a Tribal area JU. 3/ i &amp; 'within the frontier of India as defined m section(3) '27 of the General Clauses Act (1^99) provided that 'such a person is in possess ion of a certificate of 'identity signed by a responsible officer'.

Such protection does not 'give them thejright to claimkhe benefit of the 'Capitulations between Turkey and this country, but u it entitles themjas British-protected persons to 'receive British passports, and to have the aid and 'support of Her Majesty*s Diplomatic and Consular 'officers in any difficulties which they may have with 'the Ottoman authorities'. Instructions were accordingly issued to the Consuls and the Turkish Government was addressed on the subject.

Lord Salisbury thereon instructed Sir W.White that it was undesirable that the Porte should raise this question with the other great Powers and that he should endeavour to find means to prevent this being done. Sir W.White thereon ceased to press for a settlement of the question, and was 'fozztszsilf instructed to address a Circular to Consular Officers stating that 'it is 'not desirecLto raise the question of protection of 'Afghans unnecessarily and directing them before 'acting on the instructions contained m the Circular 'of 12 May 1890 to refer to ip n any particular case 'that may arise'. It should be added that m the course of the correspondence the Turkish Government, having been furnished viifh a copy of the letter of July 1880 to Abdur Rahman as showing our position with Afghanistan in respect of foreign relations, stated thiirfvieu) as follows in a Note of L Aug .1991:-this ooimaunioution (i.a. the letter to the 'Amir) contains no provisions conferring on British 'Consular authorities a right of protection over 'Afghans in Turkey , the Council of Ministers to 'whom the question has been submitted, has arrived 'at the conclus ion that Afghans, finding themselves 'already under the protsection of the Khalifate, 'should continue their enjoyment thereof'. The latest occasion on which the qne^b ion rose in a prac tical form was in 1906 when it was decided to refuse an application for a passport from an Afghan on the ground, not of policy, but because the information as to the applicant was not such as to justify our doing so. It was stated in our letter to the Foreign Office of 19 July 190V on the subject that the general pesition was the same now as in 1891. It i's^observed that in the correspondence as to Siam, mentioned in the earlier part of this memorandum, it was expressly stated in the Govt, of India's letter to Mr. Paget that ' bond fide subjects 'of the Amir of Afghan istan should not be registered 'as Briti&amp;i subjects, but it is desirable, unless 'you see any objection, that Consular officers should 'extend theiti good offices to any Natives of 'Afghanistan who may apply to them for Consular a** &amp; 'assistance'. In Kashgar , the folio Ming instructions were sent to the Resident in Kashmit- by the r rovt.

A state which has no foreign relations cannot take steps to protect its subjects abroad, therefore the state which diplomatically acts for it must arrange for the protection. But the state upon which a demand for protection is based has a right to demand from the intervening and demanding state proof that it has the right to intervene and to act for the state whose subject is to be protected. Pot only so, but the sovereign, of the subject who is to be protected must at least acquiesce in, and should probably solicit, the intervention of the Government which sets itself forward as the protector. The British Government does not xoish to produce, perhaps has not got, conclusive proof that it has the right to act for Afghanistan. The Afghan sovereign has not only not ashed its intervention, but he still claims to provide his am foreign agents and to take measures for the protection in Persia of his subjects. ft seems to me that, as a matter of policy, ice should not ask a Foreign Power to recognise British protection of any particular Afghan unless the Afghan subject claims such protection from us. If, even then, the Foreign Government demurs and demands proof of our right, we should either assert it on the of the Afghan ruler xoho by his request would admit our right, or else in the absence of such request cease to press the claim as we did with Turkey. Meanwhile each case must be reported for orders. 9 C r ifIf 103 prot30t Afghan siibjoot? abroad, vie must be prepared to guarantee the protection of the Foreign state's subjects in Afghanistan, a matter of some difficulty* For these reasons, I would take no action until the Amir complains. When he complains he will doubtless admit our right and duty to protect his subjects. This admitted xoe need fear no challenge from Turkey to produce our credentials. I would aioait then the Amir's next move, and not half recognise his claims by asking him to appoint an Assistant to our Consul-General. It is enough for us that Persia accepts our particular recommendations in a friendly spirit. Until the Amir asks us to undertake the protection of his subjects and admits our right to intervene, v)e shall intervene only in particular cases. When he asks us loe shall be more free to deal with any Foreign Government on the basis that Afghanistan admits its subordination to us.SB »■ Political, No. 55. India Office, London, 23rd June 1905.

Your Excellency will see that, acting upon the advice of the Law Officers of the Crown, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs lias issued circular despatches to His Majesty’s representatives abroad explaining the terms of the circular Despatch of the 3rd July 1893,^and informing them that His Majesty’s Government consider that the same measure of protection may properly be extended to British-protected persons abroad as to Biitish subjects, except in so far as the right or power to exercise such protection depends upon a treaty, agreement, or statutory enactment, \which excludes, or cannot he construed as including, such protected persons. It is pointed out that the measure of the protection which may be accorded must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. With regard, however, to the Ottoman Dominions, His Majesty’s Government hold that there is nothing in the Capitulations to prevent them from placing British-protected persons on the same footing as British subjects in the matter of jurisdiction; and they consider that the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899 in its definition of British subjects plainly asserts this right, which has not been disputed by the Turkish Government. 3.

It will he observed that the Government of India in their letter not only submit their views upon certain points which have been laisec legal ding the status in Turkish Arabia of persons who are su jects of the Native States in India, hut further take occasion to discuss the wider question as to the principles which should govern the status of such persons in foreign countries generally, and it seems to Mr. Erodnck most convenient to consider this wider*question first. reference to it I am to say that Mr. Brodrick concurs generally with the Governor-General in Council in the desire to see the subjects, of the protected slates of India treated abroad with the same consi deration as the British Indian subjects of His Majesty, and he agrees entirely with the opinion that for this no formal consent of the rulers of those states is needed, nor is it desirable to seek it. But on the other hand it must he borne in mind that, though in recent times the British Government has, owing to the exigencies of the position, drawn to itself the exeicise of the entire external sovereigntv and of particular portions (in some instances even the gnat hulk) of the internal sovereignty of the Indian Ruling Chiefs, yet the British Parliament, the British Indian legislatures, the Courts in. England and India, and the British authorities, political and administrative, have, down to the present moment, continued to treat the territories of those Chiefs as states hving beyond His Majesty’s dominions, and the people of those territories ns being the subjects of those Chieis and not British subjects in the proper sense, though they or their rulers may he said to owe to the British Crovn loyalty or allegiance in the wide meaning of these words. l am to add that Mr. Brodrick is advised that a definition of “British, subject, like that in Clause &lt;3 of the Ottoman Order of 1899, referred to by the Government of India, involves no departure from that view— that it is merely a device adopted hy the draftsman with a view to convenience of drafting in a case where those responsible for the Order considei that His Majesty has in some way or other acquired as against a foreign state the right to exercise within its territories, in icspect of the subjects of Indian Native States, the same powers that He possesses in respect of British subjects. Its effect is not to convert the subjects of those states into British subjects, but simply to put them, for the particular purposes ol the Order, and in so (ar as an Order of the kind can do so, on the same footing as British subjects.-pil : • 'n ,U “' g 1° P 081110 . 11 ’ li: appears to Mr. Brodrick that Lord Llgin s Government were right in holding, in their letter of the 8th Onto her 1894 (referred to in paragraph 2 of the Government of India’s letter now under consideration), that Sir T. Sanderson’s letter to rn/lV^'v V’ f *l le . 21st June 1893 S 0l ' e| ned the case of subjects of Indian Native States in countries like the Ottoman dominions, and that it is Irom the very nature of the position, impossible for us, in &lt;enlmgwith such persons, to escape from tiie limitations mentioned in feir I. feanclerson s letter. o. !t does not, however, I am to say, follow from this that the suhiect ot an Indian ]\iuive State would, when in a foreign country, be'left iTeHiT 1 Protection. Having regard to the relations existing between the Jlnt^h Government and the Native States, the subiect of a Nati\e State would, Mr. Brodrick presumes, be in a pos tion to^claim Horn us m any foreign country, whether in the Eastern or in the Western orb., at least full “protection ’ m the more limited and proper sense in vliica he word is usually understood in States of the Western type t0 t,le f x ^ ion &amp;s t0 sHtutory provisions mentioned hv wnid i S;m , d 7 0 ^. | w ilcl h ^ the case of the subject of a Native StaH, v on Id not be likely to be imp irtant, nor could our diplomatic and consular agents ictiise to extend suelr protection to him, except in circumstances m which they would deny it to a British subject. urtln-r, as our claim to extend protection of this sort to the subject o. a .Native State stands on grounds independent of any sort o*-’ concessum by a loreign state, Mr. Brodrick presumes that no foreign state uould be likely to dispute it. (). -AssumirgHhis to he so, it would be only in regard to the further measure of protection exercise l in foreign states of the Eastern type— that is to say in regard to special privileges, the right to exercise extensive foreign jurisdiction and the like, for which we should have to rely on treaty capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and so forth, that there would be room tor any question, and it would he impossible o say, without making detailed inquiries, in what foreign countries and m regard to what classes of persons under our protection, our claim to exercise this further measure of protection has been, or is likely to he disputed, and how tar hardship or inconvenience has arisen, or is likelv to arise, from this. It may be that there are places where our claim has not yet been recognised, and where it would he desirable for us to assert it or press for a concession; but Mr. Brodrick would he averse to the formulation of any principle which would commit us to taking tins course everywhere, and in regard to all classes of persons under oui protection. No doubt, as a rule, the grounds on which such a claim is recognised in the case of His Majesty’s subjects, apply equally in the case of persons under His Majesty’s protection, but this'may not always be so. Again, there are classes of persons entitled to our protection, hut who do not choose to claim it, and whom it may he best to leave to their own devices. Further, there are some tribes on the coniines ot India whom we regard as in some sense under our protection or at least within our sphere of influence, hut whose position with reference to us is not as yet clearly defined, and in regard to which questions of difficulty might arise. Eor these reasons Mr. Brodrick \vould prefer to wait and deal with each case as it arises with reference to its particular circumstances. -i-i ?*i T&lt; ? t - Uln n0W to tlie fl liest i ons raised in Baghdad. Mr. Brodrick thinks it is by no means improbable, having regard to what is said in the enclosures to the Government of India’s letter, and in the letter of t m 22nd February 1904 from the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople, that any objections which have been raised to our claim to exercise, in respect to subjects of the Indian Native States andOttoman oX ° Ul ' protection the powers and jurisdiction wind, the 111 Counci1 of assumes us to possess, are simply offices and the’f 0 ™ 0 ? ° r ° f intelli g ence the Turkish loc.d tadeedlord l Xr UrSe ! ,e l would fecordmgly propose to take, unless indeed Lo.d Lansdowne feels any doubt as to the correctness of the assumption made m the Order in Council, is to request the Govern! ment of India to instruct the Consul-General at Baghdad that if in the ordinary course any case of tl.e subject of an Indian Native State or other protected person comes before him to which the Order in Council applies, and which seems to him in other respects a proper one to he dealt with under that Order, he should not hesitate so to deal with it •' and that it any serious difficulty is raised by the local officials be should consult the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court. 8. The questions referred to in I he correspondence as to the acquisition by persons under British protection of the Turkish nationality! and as to the holding of land by persons who have not acquired that n itionalitv are collateral matters, as to which Mr. Brodrick does not propose to issue any instructions unless they should present themselves in a more definite shape ; but seeing that the Turks possess a regular naturalisation law, the former question ought to be a simpler one than it is in other Oriental countries. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. I have, &amp;e., A. (Jodley Annex. Memorandum by Legal Adviser, India Office. It must, I think, be admitted that there are good reasons why subjects of IS arive Srates should, when found in foreign countries, enjov the same measure of protection as is accorded to British subjects. The matter is discussed in Hall’s Treatise on Foreign Jurisdiction, Section 100, and the view taken by him is similar to Hat urged by the Government of India. &gt;.or do 1 see any objection to the proposal which is made as well with reference to subjects of Native States in India as to subjects of other protectorates, provided that it is clearly understood that it isonlj r in foreign countries that they are deemed to be British subjects. It is another question whether foreign governments are bound to treat as British subjects persons who do not really come within that designation. That must, I think, depend on the terms of the treaty or other understanding between tln^British Government and the govern ment concerned. I can hardly think that the expression “ subject of England ” was when originally used in the Capitulations intended to include subjects of protected states, but I presume that the expression has since been understood to have that extended meaning, or that other wise file Ottoman Government has consented to extend to such persons privileges originally conceded to British subjects only. I presume that this must be so, for otherwise the term “ British subject ” used in the Order in Council of 189 ( J could not well have had assigned to it the meaning given in Clause 2. I suggest that it should be ascertained how it came to have that meaning assigned to it. I would also suggest -that it may be desirable to ascertain in what respects subjects of Native States are at a disadvantage as compared with natives of British India, whether they are at a disadvantage in matters other than those to which the Order in Council relates, and whether the certificate given under that Order is ever questioned by the Ottoman authorities. It would rather seem that the difficulty 16021 . Barises from the neglect on the part of subjects of Native States to obtain certificates of registration. 13th May 1904. H. H. Shephard.

Memorandum by Mr. Hurst on India Office Letter of 7th July 1904. I have bad to keep these papers a long time, as they have involved a considerable amount of study on somewhat difficult questions. Hie proposal to which the India Office ask Lord Lansdowne to aoree is contained in paragraph 7 of their letter, and is in substance that°the Consul-General at Baghdad should be instructed that in ordinarv cases where he considers it proper to do so, he should treat the subjects of ndmn native states and other British protected persons as British (Paper.).) subjects, adopting in this respect ^ , . the same position as the Ottoman Order m Council 1899. 1 0 this proposal I think agreement should be expressed, but the letter and its enclosures discusses the geueral status abroad of British-pro tec ted persons, and I do not think we can avoid offering observations on the general questions raised. It is impossible to compare the letter from the Government of India to tin* India Office with that from the India Office to this Office without seeing that there is a considerable diver gence between them, and speaking for myself, I think the measure of protection to be afforded abroad to natives of the Protected States iu India is better defined in the letter of the Government of India than in that io which we must now reply. It is well to bear in mind that the question involved a fleets not only the inhabitants of the Native states in India but the inhabitants of all the British Protectorates as well. 1 reference is made in both tha letters under review and also in other (P.ipor I t ^ ie enclosures to a circular issued by this Office in 1893, with regard to the mensure of protection to be afforded to natives and vessels of a foreign state, such as North Borneo, which is under British protec tion. Both parties have felt that the limitations described in it must also apply to the natives of the Protected States in India. This (Paper H \ circular was based on a Law OHicers’ opinion obtained in view of certain questions which a director of the British North Borneo Com pany had put to Sir E. Grey soon after our protectorate of that territory had been declared. The Law Officers’ Report dealt with the status abroad of natives of protectorates and spheres of influence generally, and laid it down that a native of the former was entitled to British protec tion abroad from Consular Officers except in so far as the action of such officers is founded on statutes or treaties referring only to British subjects, and they added that such a native cannot be considered to be a British subject so far as the application of such treaties or statutes is concerned. This latter statement, wdnch is embodied also in the circular, is, I think, liable to misapprehension, and I am inclined to think it has been misunderstood. It must be read in connection with the previous sentence and in that previous sentence I think that British subject is used in its technical sense. There are some treaties under which Consuls act where the word “British subject*’ is not used at all; certainly one and perhaps /u ^ . T , more (Muscat 1873, Siam 1899) (Pnpers X anil L.) . v . , 7 7 where the word has been ex tended by agreement to include some who are only protected persons, and others where it has certainly been treated by both the contracting n parties as not having been em ployed in its technical sense, e.g. Zanzibar (1886).intended that he construed the words in a sense I cannot think that the Law Officers “ Lritish subjects” in such treaties should different from that intended by the parties. The limitation contained in the Law Officers’ opinion, and repeated in the circular only, I think, amounts to this, that the Secretary of State cannot confer on protected persons abroad benefits which by statute or treaty are restricted to those who are British subjects according to the technical meaning of that word in English law, &lt;?.&lt;/., a Zanzibari cannot he treated as a British subject for the purposes of the Foreign Uganda he registered as a British subject in Siam, as the latter would be contrary to the Agreement (Paper N.) Marriage Act, nor can a native of (Paper L ) of 1899. It seems to me that the position in law of British protected persons abroad may be summarized as follows: that the Secretory of State is entitled to extend to them the same measure of protection as to British subjects, except in so far as the terms of either a treaty or a law present it, but that, not, being British subjects, they are not entitled to such protection as of right, and the Secretary of State may, if he think fit, treat them differently. This is, I think, consistent with the view the Law Officers enter tained in 1893; and it approximates to the status of the natives of German Protectorates as defined by Count Metternich in his commu nication of 17th August of this year : “ Natives in the German Protectorates have accordingly, even as regards their persons, no “ share in those rights which the German laws grant to German “ nationals (Beichsangeborigen) as such. They are therefore not ‘‘ ‘ Beichsangehorigen ’ in this more restricted legal sense. From the “ point of view of International Law, however, as being subjects of “ the Empire, they are considered as ‘ Angehorigen ’ thereof in the broader sense, and as such have a claim to Imperial protection even “ outside the Protectorate.” The view I have indicated above appears to me to provide adequately the elasticity which paragraph 6 of the India Office letter shows to be necessary, as it leaves the Secretary of State a discretion as to what measure of protection to afford : it also leaves no scope for friction with the local sovereign, as the decision rests wholly with the Secretary of Slate, and it is only where there is a distinct limitation in the terms of the treaty to that effect, that the local sovereign can claim that protected persons should be treated differently to British subjects. It also obviates all necessity for any special or further agreements being concluded with the Indian feudatory princes, a step the Indian Government deprecates. Applying these principles to the case of the natives of protected States in India, it will, in my opinion, be found that there is no limitation on the power of the Secretary of State to place them on the same footing in the Ottoman Dominions as British subjects in the matter of protection and jurisdiction. There is nothing that I can see in the Capitulations to show that (Paper P.) “ the English ” means “ British subjects in the sense in which that word is used in the Naturalisation Act, 1870. The date of the (Pa 0) Capitulations is 1041, a period anterior to the formation of the precise rules about British nationality that now obtain. Further, I think ic is quite impossible to read Articles XXXI1I.-IV. of the Cajhtulations without seeing that there was no intention in the mind of the Porte to limit the privileges of that treaty to the “ English,” in any narrow sense, for the preamble to Article XXXIV. expressly allows “the merchants of Spain, Portugal, Ac. . . . and ail other16021 . C merchant strangers ” to have recourse to the protection of the English Consuls. Lastly, in their opinion of 18th August 1904, the present Law Officers (Paper Q ) distinctly laid it down that persons ... might he entitled to the benefit of the Capitulations who are not British subjects in the technical sense. I think it is clear from the above that there is nothing in the terms Capsulations to prevent the full measure of protection being a^orded to British protected persons that is given to British subjects. I agree with the view expressed in the India Office letter that the inclusion of “ British protected person ” in the term “ British subject ” m the Ottoman Order in Council 1899 does not convert them into British subjects, but it is to my mind a most distinct assertion of the right of His Majesty as against the Porte to place British protected persons on the same footing as British subjects. It must not be forgotten that the right of these Kashmiris and others to piotection could not be challenged by the Porte if Kashmir were annexed and incorporated in the British dominions. The Native States in India enjoy their present position merely because it is part of the policy of the Indian Government not to annex; but if that policy were reversed, and annexation of the Native States decided on, no foreign Power would he allowed to raise objections, and the treatment to be accorded to their inhabitants when abroad appears to me to be a matter equally outside the scope of foreign interference, whether such States are annexed or not. W ith regard to registration, I think the same policy might be suggested as has been adopted for China, viz., that protection and registration should go together. If a Kashmiri settling in the Ottoman dominions prefers to identify himself with the Native population and to refrain from claiming whatever rights to British protection he may have, I see no reason why he should not be allowed to ; but if he does, he should not be permitted to demand British protection the moment he gets into trouble and needs consular assistance. He should not be recognized (in the absence of exceptional circumstances) untii he has registered himself, and protection should be limited to events subsequent to the registration. C. J. B.

With reference to my letter of the 26th ultimo, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India in Council, a copy of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople on the subject of the protection to be afforded to Afghans and to subjects of the Native States in India. I am to state that his Lordship is awaiting the expression of Mr. Secretary Brodrick’s opinion with regard to the terms of the proposed reference to the Law Officers of the Crown, the dralt of which accompanied my letter above referred to. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State F. A. Campbell. tor India.Annex 1. Mr. Town ley to Foreign Office. No. 48 (Treaty). Constantinople, My Lord, 12th December 1904. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bagdad and the Government of India have been in correspondence with regard to the amount of protection to he afforded to Afghans and to the subjects of the Native Indian rulers. Major Newmarch has transmitted to the Embassy copies of this correspondence which includes a letter from the Government of India to the Secretary of State, dated 17th March last, advocating that the limitations imposed by the Foreign Office Circular (Treaty) of 3rd July 1893 should be modified and that British ollicials should extend to the subjects of a protected Native State the same degree of protection as they claim to exercise in the case of British Indian subjects of the Crown. As from Major Newmarch’s reports there seems a disposition on his part to anticipate by acts of registration and otherwise the conclusions of llis .Majesty’s Government with regard to this question, I have thought it well to address him a despatch, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, calling attention to the existing instructions on the subject. With regard to the question of Afghans, the matter is at present simple, but with regard to the subjects of Native Protected States of India, l am advised that the Ottoman Order in Council 1899, placing them for certain purposes on the same footing as British subjects, somewhat complicates the question. I do not wish on this occasion to express any opinion with regard to the policy advocated by the Govern ment of India in their letter to Mr. Secretary Brodrick above referred to, as it may not even have reached your Lordship, but I should be glad to be informed, as Major Newmarcli has raised tin's question, whether lam right, in view of the Order in Council above quoted, in assuming in my despatch to that officer that the instructions contained in the Foreign Office circular of 3rd July 1893 still hold good, and have undergone no change in the nature of their application to the status of subjects of Native Indian States in the Ottoman Dominions.

With reference to your Despatch No. 65, of the 21st October, and more especially to the last paragraph of the letter to the Govern ment of India enclosed therein, recording the registration of an Afghan, I would draw your attention to the Embassy circulars to Consuls of 12th May 1890 and 30th November 1891, respecting the extent to which persons of Afghan nationality are entitled to British protection in the Ottoman dominions. I transmit herewith copies of these circulars for faeility of reference, and I would be glad if you would adhere to the instructions contained therein so long as they have not been superseded. With regard to the more general question raised in your Despatches No. 42 of 21st July, and No. 65, of the amount of protection to beaccorded to subjects of States under British protection, His Majesty’s Embassy have not received any intimation from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs modifying the instructions contained in his circular of 3rd July 1893 (quoted in tee Government of India’s letter to Mr. Secretary Brodrick of 17th March last) which must accordingly guide their action should any question of this nature be brought before them. 1 have no douht that the great caution and tact enjoined on you by the Government of India in dealing with this matter will deter you from taking any avoidable action likely to raise any awkward discussion u ith ihe Ottoman authorities as to the status in Turkey of the categorv of peisons in question, more especially until His Majesty’s Government have expressed their views in reply to the Government of India’s representations.

In order that all doubt on the subject may be removed, I beg to inform you that you are hereby instructed to extend to subjects of the Amir sojourning in the Ottoman Empire your unofficial countenance and protection whenever needed.

O Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 16th January 1905. I have the honour, by direction of the Marquess of Lansdowne, to transmit to you a letter from the India Office and its enclosures, papers noted in the accompanying list* which relate more particularly to the question of the status in the Ottoman dominions of subjects of the Native States in India. The wider question of the status of such persons in foreign countries generally is also discussed. It will he seen from Enclosure 2 in the India Office letter (Paper C.) that Major Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and Consul-General at Bagdad, lias recently referred, for the consideration of the Government of India, certain cases arising within his jurisdiction involving questions as to the Courts before which such persons should be tried, the administration of their estates, and generally as to the degree of protection which should be accorded them. A further despatch from Major Newmarch of the Mil April 1904 (Paper D), incloses the opinion of the Judge of the Supreme Court at Constantinople on these points. The views of the Government of India, both on tin* questions thus raised and also on the wider question of the protection in foreign countries of the subjects of Indian Native States, are fully set forth in their letter of the 17th March 1904 (Taper B). A note by the Legal Adviser, India Office, of the 13th May 1904 (Paper E), is also enclosed; while the views and suggestions of the Secretary of State for India in Council are contained in the India Office letter of the 7th July 1904 (Paper A), which, in forwarding the above correspondence, encloses in addition correspondence which had passed between the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and the Government of India in 1893-1894 (Paper F), when the matter was previously under consideration. A memorandum, which has been drawn up by Mr. Hurst, Assistant Leital Adviser to this Department, is also enclosed (Paper G). The further papers (H to Q) aie those referred to in the foregoing correspondence. I have the honour to request that you will be good enough to take these papers into your consideration, and that you will favour Lord Lansdowne with your opinion on the following points :— 1. Whether the opinion of your predecessors expressed in their Report of the 8th June 1893 (Paper H), paragraph 1, bears the interpretation : That the Secretary of State is entitled to extend to British-protected persons abroad the same measure of protection as to British subjects except in so far as the right or power to exercise which protection depends upon a treaty, agree ment, or law which excludes “ or cannot he construed as including such protected persons,” but that not being British subjects^ they are not entitled to such protection as of right; 2. Whether, having regard to the terms of the capitulations, the Secretary of State has the power to place such persons oil the same footing in the Ottoman dominions as British subjects in the matter of protection and jurisdiction.His Lordship will also be glad to be favoured with any observations of a general nature which you may desire to offer upon the papers now submitted to you. I am to add that this reference has been submitted to the Secretary of State for India in Council for his observations, and that Mr. llrodrick concurs in its terms. I have, &amp;c., The Law Officers of E. A. Campbell. The Crown. Annex 2. Law Officers’ Report. ]. We do not think that our predecessors in their Report of the 8th June 1893, laid down that British-protected persons abroad were not entitled as of right to protection, and, in our opinion, British-protected persons are 'so entitled. When the whole control of foreign relations has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government it appears to us that the duty of protection follows. What measure of protection can be given must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. If that jurisdiction is confined to those who are, in the strict technical sense of our municipal law, British subjects, it cumot be exercised in respect of protected person*. 2. We sec nothing in the capitulations to prevent the Secretary of State from placing British protected persons on the same footing in the Ottoman dominions as British subjects in the matter of protection and jurisdiction, and we think that the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899, in its definition of “British subject,” plainly asserts this right which, so far as we know, has not been disputed by the Porte. 3. We think that the right asserted in the Order in Council to treat protected persons in the Ottoman dominions as on the same footing with British subjects should be adhered to. R. B. Finlay.

On the 3rd July 1893,* a Circular (Treaty) despatch was * T r „ ~ addressed by the Earl of Rosebery No. 154 (External). to Hls Majesty s Representatives abroad, inclosing for their in formation and guidance a copy of correspondence with Mr. R. B. Martin, M.P., respecting the assistance and protection to be afforded by His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers to natives and vessels of a foreign state which is under British protection, and the conduct of whose foreign relations is under the control of His Majesty’s Government. Questions have recently arisen with regard to the correct interpretation to be placed on paragraph 1 of the letter to Mr. Martin of the 21st June1893 (Enclosure 2 in the circular despatch above referred to). I am therefore directed to inform you that His Majesty’s Government consider that the same measure of protection may properly he extended to British-protected persons abroad as to British subjects, except in so far as the right or power to exercise such protection depends upon a treaty, agreement, or statutory enactment, which excludes, or cannot be construed as including such “ protected persons.” When the whole control of the foreign relations of a state has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, it is apparent that the duty of protecting the natives or subjects of that State in other countries must also be assumed. What measure of protection can be given must depend upon the extent of the jurisdiction enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in the country where the protection is desired. It is only where that jurisdiction is confined to those who are, in the strict technical sense of our municipal law, British subjects, that it cannot be exercised in respect of protected persons.

In view of the arrangement made with those States in 1888 and of the circulars issued by your predecessor on the 22nd May 1905 respecting the treatment of natives of British protected States, I propose to inform Mr. Vice Consul Richardson that he is justified in according to natives of Shehr and Makalla the same protection that he would accord to British subjects. I propose also to inform the Sublime Porte that in the case of Mahomed and Ahmed Ba Saleh, respecting which they have made representa tions to Hie Majesty’s Embassy Mr. Richardson's ac tion, as reported in his despatch No.97 of November Sir E.

Sir:- I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of despatches from His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Hodeida respecting the refusal of the local authorities to recognise natives of Shehr and Makalla as 'being under British protection. It would appear from Mr. Richard son’s despatches that it was decided 'by His Majesty’s Government in communication with the Government of India in 1903, that these persons were entitled to British protection, hut as I cannot find that this decision was made known to His Majesty’s Embassy at the time and as it is contrary to that previously ar rived at by His Majesty's Government and communicated to His Majesty's Ambassador in Lord Lansdowne's des patch No .266 of September 28th, 1903, I should be glad to receive your instructions on the subject. Mr. Richardson says that in the opinion of the Law Officers protected persons are under the Order in Council Sir E. Grey, Bart. M.P. &amp;c ., &amp;c., &amp;c.Council 1899 entitled to the same protection as that afforded to British subjects. If the Law Officers are correctly quoted this would seem to imply that all protected persons are entitled to the full benefits of the Capitulations between Great Britain and Turkey, including for instance the subjects of the Amir of Afghanistan. No such claim has hitherto been put for ward by His Majesty's Embassy and it will certainly not be accepted by the Sublime Porte. I have, &amp;c.. (Signed) G. Barclay.CAMARAN. November 21st,, 1906. Sir: I have the honour to submit herewith a report on the case of the two persons trading at Hodeida, viz. Mahomed and Ahmed BaSaleh, on whose behalf this Vice- Consulate recently intervened, and to which reference is made in the Porte’s Note Verbale No.57 dated the 19th September to His Majesty's Embassy, a copy of which was transmitted to me in Mr. Tilley's despatch of the 25th ultimo. The two above-mentioned merchants were registered last March for the first time in the Vice-Consulate during my absence on leave, but the action of my locum tenens was justified by the fact that these persons produced passports then issued to them by the Politi cal Resident at Aden, describing them as 'British pro tected subjects.' In August last I transmitted a copy of a petition received from the two persons referred to, relating to a His Excellency George Head Barclay, C.M.G., Constantinople.a claim against an Ottoman subject, to the local authorities with a request that the same be passed on to the Commercial Tribunal for disposal. The Acting mutasarrif returned the petition to me, de claring that the applicants were known locally as Ottoman subjects. Subsequently at a business interview with the Acting Governor, I mentioned the case in question t and pointed out taut the two bnotheTS, Mahomed and Ahmed BaSaleh were neither Ottoman subjects by birth, nor had they accepted such nationality by naturaliza tion or through acquiring a domicile, in accordance with the Ottoman Law of Nationality. On the con trary, I added, they were subjects of the State of Hydramaut, which enjoys His Majesty's protection. \ Mahmoud Bey, then officiating as mutasarrif, con tended that Mahomed BaSaleh had been an assessor at one time in the local commercial Court, and that his brother Ahmed BaSaleh had been a member of the Ho-/ not consider these qualifications sufficient to estab lish a case in favour of their Ottoman nationality, which could only be based on the Ottoman Laws relat ing thereto. I ascertained later from Mahomed BaSaleh that he had accepted many years ago for a short time, an honor ary position as Assessor in the Tribunal of Commerce at the request of the authorities, but that he had never acknowledged being a Turkish subject. I then proposed that a joint enquiry be instituted to examine and report on the merits of the two persons whose nationality was under dispute, as was done in the case of certain Indians in 1902, but the Acting Governor did not appear disposed to resort to this course. I reserved the case for discussion with the Vail at Sana'a, but His Excellency informed me that the mat- « ter had already been reported to Constantinople, for orders. Mahomed and Ahmed BaSaleh are natives of Makulla in -in Hydrarnaut, and have set themselves up in business at Hodeida for many years, although at the same time, it must be added, that the brothers have not estab lished permanent residence at that town. They are partners in business, and while one remains here for a few years in charge of the firm, the other lives in his native town; Ahmed BaSaleh is now absent from Hodeida, being at Makulla. These two merchants did not originally come from Egypt as erroneously stated in the Porte’s Note Verbale referred to, although they have visited that country in the interests of their trade. I am in formed that they came from Aden where they ha.d set tled for some time. /our Excellency will no doubt remember that some correspondence occurred in the early part of last year between His Majesty’s Foreign and India i Offices on the subject of the status of British pro tected subjects in the Ottoman Dominions and that it was ultimately decided to register natives of Shehr and Makulla as protected subjects in the Turk-Turkish Empire. The Government of India, in view of Lord Lans- downe's opinion in the recent case of Sheik Omar Bas- ar, where the latter was granted a passport at Men to Hodeida, have.since issued instructions to the Politi cal Resident at Men for the due observance of the principle set forth in the above case, viz. that sub jects of Shehr and Makulla are entitled to British protection in the Ottoman Dominions, and that they should be granted passports when proceeding to places therein. I beg to opine in conclusion that my interference under the circumstances, in the cases under report, was justifiable, and venture to suggest that the Porte be notified that the persons above mentioned are under British protection, and that it be caused to send the necessary instructions thereon to the Yemen authori ties. There are other cases of this nature now under dispute, which are being reported in separate des patchesNo.101. CAMARA N, November 23t-h, 1906. | Sir:- I have the honour to refer to Sir N. 0*Conor's despatch of October 7th 1903 to Mr. Consul Devey, copy of which was transmitted to me, with reference to the application of one, Shaik Omar Basar, to he registered as a British protected subject at Hodeida The applicant in question appealed to the Poli tical Resident at Aden in 1904, through the Sultan of Shehr and Makulla, for a re-consideration of his case. Some correspondence was interchanged in 1905, on the subject of Omar Basar’s petition for registra tion at Hodeida as a protected subject, between the Government of India and the India Office, and also between the latter and the Foreign Office. Ultimately, His Majesty's Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in a despatch dated the 6th June, His Excellency George Head Barclay, C.M.G., Constantinople.June^ 1905 informed the Under Secretary of State for India; that Lord Lansdowne agreed with Mr. Secretary Brodrick that the man; Omar Basar was entitled to receive the passport to Hodeida which the Aden auth orities were willing to grant him. The Government of India were accordingly in formed in a Political Despatch No.57; dated the 30th June; 1905 from His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India that there was no objection to issue the passport to Hodeida; sought by the Sheik in question. This was, in due course, granted to the latter by the Political Resident at Aden. A copy of the correspondence that had passed relative to this case; was sent to the Vice Consulate V for my information. Shaik Omar Basar and his family returned to Ho- -deida during my absence on leave; and were duly registered as protected subjects on application, by my locum tenens, after examination of their pass ports. Last month, Omar Basar's son complained about/ i the arbitrary attitude of the port authorities in connection with a boat belonging to his father, and petitioned me for intervention on his behalf with the local authorities. The Mutasarrif of Hodeida, as in the similar instances of Mahomed and Ahmed BaSaleh already re ported to Your Excellency, has contested my interfer- ence on behalf of the man, contending that he is an Ottoman subject, and adding that if he has changed his nationality, orders from the Porte accepting the innovation, are necessary. I am of opinion that reference in this case to the Vail will be quite useless. It is respectfully suggested that His Majesty's Embassy represent the matter to the Porte and request it to instruct the Hodeida authorities to recognize Sheik Omar Basar and the members of his family as being under British protection, to which it has been proved they are justly entitled. With truth and great respect, • » I have &amp;c., (Signed) G. A. Richardson, His Majesty's Vice-Consul.C A M A R A N, 'i Mo.102. V ^ Sir:- November 23th, 1905. Great difficulty has teen experienced of late with the authorities at Hodeida, in obtaining recog nition as British subjects or as being under the pro tection of this Vice Consulate, of Arabs arriving from Aden in possession of passports issued by the Political Resident. The latter are granted after careful examina tion and enquiry Into the merits of each case, and the holders have invariably been persons legally en titled to protection. Those affected are chiefly natives of Shehr and Makulla, states in political relation with the Aden Residency, and whose subjects, under treaty, enjoy His Majesty’s protection. Natives of Hydramaut, have for many years past, been engaged in trade at Hodeida. These merchants generally His Excellency George Head Barclay, C.M.G., Constantinople.generally reside here lor a period of five years or so before returning to their country for one or two years and then they come hack Their business in their absence is carried on by relatives. As a general rule, a permanent domicile is not established at Hodeida, except perhaps as far as their trade is concerned. Trie families of these persons in most cases, reside in their native towns in Hydramaut. Hionerto, tne local authorities have treated these Hydrami merchants as Ottoman subjects, although the:' have not accepted naturalization formally nor adopted Ottoman nationality of their own free will; tuvj having no consul uo appeal to, they have had no alternative but to submit. There have been a few instances during the past four.years where some of these merchants have applied oo me for assistance but I have had to inform them that there was no precedent for the interfer ence of this Vice-Consulate. They were advised to refer to the Aden Residency that controls the polit ical relations and affairs of native states in Arabia.In 1905, I ain given to understand, the Sultan of Shehr and Makulla represented to the Political Resident at Aden that his subjects trading at Model- da were denied British protection, to which they were entitled, under the Treaty of 1383 with the Gov ernment of India. This together with the application for a pass port to Yemen of Shaik Omar Basar, led to correspond ence between the Government of India and the India Office. The Law Officers of the Crown, on reference being made to them, gave it as their opinion, that under the Ottoman Order in Council of 1399, protected subjects are entitled to the same measure of protec tion as that afforded to British subjects; further, that this right plainly asserted in the Ordinance referred to, has not been disputed by the Porte and should be adhered to. This opinion was communicated by Mis Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the India Office. EverNil 4i Ever since the Crovermnent 01 India instructed the Aden Residency to observe the principle then laid down when it was decided to grant a passport to Shaiic Qaar Basar, the Political Resident has issued passports to natives of Shehr and Maicuila proceeding to Yemen ports. Those of the latter formerly trad ing and resident at Hodeida have gone to Aden, sought passports and returned here. On arrival or departure by sea, these merchants are subjected to difficulties on production of their passports visa-ed by this Vice Consulate. baring my absence at Sana'a, on one occasion the Hodeida officials refused to recognize the visa-ed passport of a native of Mokulla and compelled him to take a Turkish teskhare before permitting him to sail for Aden. Where British protected subjects, who are natives of Shehr or Makulla, seek consular interference on their behalf in law-suits in the local courts againstcourts in question to admit British Consular inter vention, or that such persons are under the protec tion oi the Vice Consulate. This often leads com pulsorily to a private settlement out of court, to oi.s detriment oi the protected subject concerned. In snort, an unsatisfactory state of affairs iestilus and exists in this way, at Hcdeida. Though it might appear undesirable to raise the general question at the Porte of the status of Hydramis in the Turkish Dominions, or to obtain its admission of the fact that they are under His Majes- s protec oi on at Hodeida, I have to respectfullv request, with great reluctance, in view of the dlffi- culuies enumerated above that are frequently bein^ 4 experienced at Hodeida, that a representation be made on the subject, at the proper quarter. While being bound to admit the credentials of persons producing passports issued by the Political Res^deno ao Aden, in the name of the Government of Bombay, I am, under present circumstances, owing to naoural obstructive altitude of the Hodeida auth - ^ orlties, unable to obtain recognition of the same locally V/ f r In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote N °- Ut&amp;rt' and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Toreign Office, London.

Sir:- The Marquess of Lansdowne has had under his con sideration your letter of the 8th of March last, in which you request an expression of His Lordship’s views as to whether the Resident at Aden should be authorized to grant to one Omar Basar, a native of Shehr and Mokallah, a British passport to Hodeidah. v The question of principle involved in your letter was dealt with in the Report from the Law Officers of the Crown, which was conmunicated to the India Office on the 22nd ultimo. In view of their opinion Lord Lansdowne agrees with Mr. Secretary Brodrick that the man Omar Basar is entitled to receive the passport which the Aden authorities are apparently willing to grant to him. His Lordship considers that the question raised in the last paragraph of your letter is one which can be more The Under Secretary of State, India Office.more readily answered by the British local officials than by this Department. If a man who is entitled to British Protection re frains from applying for such protection for a long period, the delay may doubtless afford reasonable ground for refusing to extend it to him supposing always . that the British local officials consider such a course j I to be desirable, but, if they are not of this opinion, the protection need not necessarily be withheld. On the other hand such British protection should be limited to events occurring after the grant of the British passport and the grantee should not be allowed, by obtaining recognition as a British protected person, to escape the consequences of his actions while he was content to hold the position of an Ottoman subject.

Hill, Esquire, C.I.E. , Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to refer to the memorandum from the Government of India, Foreign Department, Ho. 2514 E.A., of the 22nd October 1903, forv/arding copy of a correspondence relative to the claim of one Sheihh Omar Basaar, a resident of Hodeida but a native of Hokalla, to be registered as a British protected person. 2. I am now to forward herewith, for the consideration of the Government of India, copy of a letter Ko. 360 of the 11th November 1904 from the Political Resident, Aden, and of its accompaniments, in connection with an application for a passport from the same individual. 3. The applicant, I am to observe, was refused British protection in 1903 on the ground that he had permanently settled in Hodeida twenty years ago, i.e. five years before the conclusion of the Protectorate Treaty with His Highness thethe Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla. It is no?/ reported, hov/ever with the authority of the Vice-Consul in support of the statement, that he started trading with Aden and Hodeida twenty-one years ago hut did not become a permanent resident —— of the latter place till about thirteen years ago, i.e.. about two years after Shehr and Llokalla came under British protection. now for the first time the Resident would, in the ordinary course, have granted the Passport applied for^aving regard however, to the fact that the Secretary of State deferred, in 1903, to the political considerations which were urged against according Sheikh Omar the recognition which he then asked, the Governor-in- Council deems it necessary to refer the question for orders. His Excellency is of opinion that the application for a passport is deserving of favourable consideration, and that unless, on a reference- to the Secretary of State, it is ascertained that there are very strong political reasons against according him the privilege to which fckx he can be held to be oreartt-ea, Sheikh Omar should be granted the passport he applies for. 4. I am to observe that if the case had been submitted I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) C.R.A.Eill, Acting Secretary to GovernmentHo. 360 of 1904. Aden Residency The 11th Hoveinher 1904. From Taajor General E.M. Mason, Political Resident , Aden; To The Secretary to the Government , Political Department, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to the correspondence forwarded under your endorsement Ho. 7451, dated the 6th Hovemher 1903, on the subject of an applica tion made to the British Vice-Consulate at Hodeida in May 1903 by Sheikh Omar Basaar, a native of Shehr and Mokalla, but permanently resident at Hodeida, praying that he and other members of his family may be accorded British protec tion. 2. The case of the applicant was at the time fully described by Mr. Richardson, Vice-Consul at Hodeida, who finding that Omar Basaar had been regarded for a long time as an Ottoman subject by the local authorities at Hodeida, thought it best to take orders in the matter from higher authorities. Accordingly the question was referred to the Home(£) Horae Sovernraent through the British Embassy at Constantinople 3. The result was a reply from the India Office in August 1903 to the effect that such persons had prira a facie the same right to he registered as British protected persons at Eodeida as at Zanzibar, but that in this particular instance it did not appear that registration could be de manded as a right, Omar Basaar having been reported to have settled at Kodeida some five years before the Shehr and Mokalla tribes came under British protection, and that therefore on the analogy of the some_what similar case of the Burmese who had settled in Siam before the annexation of Upper Burma, registration as a British subject might be refused if it was deemed undesirable, on political grounds, to admit the claimant to such registration^ 4. It will be seen that the weak point of Omar Basaar T s case was the fact of his having settled in Hodeida before .the conclusion of the Protectorate treaty with the Sultan of Shehr and T£okalla. 5. Hot having met with success in Hodeida, Omar Basaar applied to this Residency in July last for a passport. It will be noted that this was a course proposed by the Consul at Jeddah who it appears from the papers had suggest ed as a practical solution of the difficulty that Omar v should he advised to come to Aden, establish a real domicileand obtain British papers here if that could he suitably carried out 6. In the course of his affidavit in support of his application Omar Basaar declared that he had been a resident of Kodeida for the past thirteen years. It was then pointed out to him that from the correspondence alluded to above it appears that he had settled in that place twenty years ago, and he was asked to explain the discrepancy. He was also asked to produce a letter from the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla recognizing him to be still a subject of that State. 7. The letter from the Sultan to the desired effect was received in due course and a translation of the same is attached hereto. But in reference to the discrepency mentioned above the explanation offered by Omar Basaar was that though he had gone to Hodeida about twenty years ago, for purposes of trade, it is only about thirteen years^ since he settled there, the previous seven years being spent in travelling between Aden, Shehr and Hodeida . S. I was, however, unwilling to accept, without further enquiry, ^his statement which seemed to me to have been made evidently with a view to evade the objection urged against his registration as a British subject at Hodeida. A reference was therefore made to the Vice-Consul atHodeida enquiring whether the Version now given hy Omar Basaar could he accepted, fipx Copies of the correspond- once on the point are herein enclosed and it will he observed that the Vice Consul hears the applicant out in his present statement* 9. In view of this new feature of the case it seems to me V / that there could he no objection to my grant^g_thejpas sport applied for. But as the earlier papers show that there are certain political considerations involved, to which due weight must he attached, I have deemed it desirable to refer the matter for the orders of Government. I have the honour to he. Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) H.M. Ilason, Llajor General, Political Resident, Aden.Aden, 22nd July 1904, To The Court of the Hesident, Aden.

Sir, * 1 l,e S raos t humbly to inform you that in July last as a British protected subject I applied to the Court for a passport to recover my dues at Hodeida, and paid the usual fee for it, but the Registrar subsequently informed me that there was no necessity for the grant of such a passport. 2* i oeg to state that I was born at Shehr and have an extensive trade at that place, as mus well as in Aden and :;odei(ia - 1 allegiance to Hia Ttojesty's Govern- •aei.t as our Ruling Chief His Highness the Sultan of Shehr ana .Mokalla, has been accorded His Gracious Majesty's favour and protection. Hence being a British protected subjectsubject I an entitled to British protection all oyer the places wherever His Majesty has His Consular Court. 3. I beg further to represent that in the year 1903 I raised before His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Hodeida a question of my being a British protected subject and asked from him for a certificate to that effect, but that ofiicer after having had communication with the Political Resident at Aden informed me that I would get such a certificate from the Residency office at Aden as I am a British protected subject. 4. Uy object in asking for such a passport which,as a British protected subject I am entitled to, is to have the support and protection of His Majesty's Court in recovering my dues. Several persons who are residents of Shehr and Mokalla have received such passports from the Aden Residency, and I cannot say what legal difficulty tne Registrar has found in my case that he at first issued a passport after being satisfied that I was born at Shehr and then subjecting me to rigid examination, refused the grant of it. 5 ' 1 tes also t0 inform you that in Turkish territory the subjects of the Ruling Chiefs under British protec tion are treated as British protected subjects and have the support of His Majesty's Consul in Civil and other mattersmatters.

But on the other hand it must be borne in mind that, though m recent times the British Government has, owing to the exigencies of the position, drawn to itself the exercise of the entire external sovereignty and of particular portions (in some instances even the bulk) of the internal sovereignty of the Indian Kuling Chiefs^^rti^British Farhament, the British Indian legislatures, the Courts in England and India, and the British authorities political and administrative have, down to the present moment, continued to treat the territories of those Chiefs as states lying beyond His Majesty’s dominions, and the people of those territories as being the subjects of those Chiefs and not British subjects in the proper sense, though they or their rulers may be said to owe to the British Crown loyalty or allegiance in the wide meaning of these words. J- ai ?n ( J- 1 add v tha . t Mr - Brodl ick is advised that a definition of “ British subject, like that in Clause 3 of the Ottoman Order of 1899, referred to by the Government of India, involves no departure from that view—that it is merely a device adopted by the draftsman with a view to convenience of drafting m a case where those responsible for the Order consider that His Majesty has in some way or other acquired as against a foreign state the nght to exercise within its territories, in respect of the subjects of Indian Tvative otates, the same powers that He possesses in respect of British subjects Its effect is not to convert the subjects of those states into British subjects but simply to put them, for the particular purposes of the Order, and in so far as an ^rder of the kind can do so, on the same footing as British subjects. 3 4. This being the position, it appears to Mr. Brodrick that Lord Elgin’s Government were right in holding in their letter of the 8th October 1894 (referred to ia paragraph 2 of the Government of India’s letter now under consideration), that Sir 1. Sanderson’s letter to Mr. Martin of the 21st June 14600. I. 1503. 30.—6/1904./rr 1893 governed the case of subjects of Indian Native States in countries like the Ottoman dominions, and that it is, from the very nature of the position, - impossible for us, in dealing with such persons, to escape from the limitations mentioned^-Sir T. Sanderson^ 5. It does not, however, I am to say, follow from this that the subject of an Indian Native State would, when in a foreign country, be left without adequate protection. Having regard to the relations existing between the t 7 would, Mr. Brodrick presumes, be in a ftw 'V* wv position tocTaTm from us in any foreign country, whether in the Eastern or ' 'jin the Western World, at least full “protection” in the more limited and i proper sense in which the word is usually understood in States of the Western type, subject only to the exception as to statutory provisions mentioned by Sir T. Sanderson, which ortant, no r could protection to him rson, which in\Jnfl ease would not be likely to diploma tic and consular agents refuse to extend British subject. our except inj Further, as our claim in which they would deny it to a to extend protection of this sort to : ’f- ^ V ^pywelp^peKWT^stands on grounds independent of any sort of concession by a StJ-t , t-JV fore,gn State ’ ^ lr * Brodrick presumes that no foreign state would be likely to ^ i ^ / dispute it. 6. Assuming this to be so, it would be only in regard to the further measure of protection exercised in foreign states of the Eastern type that is to say in regard to special privileges, the right to exercise extensive foreign jurisdiction and the like, for which we should have to rely on treaty, capitulation, grant, usig-, sufferance, and so forth, that there would be room for any question, and it would be impossible to say, without making detailed inquiiies, in what foreign countries and in regard to what classes of persons under our protection, our claim to exercise this further measure of pro tection has been, or is likely to be, disputed, and how far hardship or inconvenience li;is arisen, or is likely to arise, from this. It may be that thcrtf are plaees w here our claim has not yet been recognised, and where it would be desirable for us lo assert it or press for a concession j but Mr. Biodrick would be averse to tbe formulation of any principle which would commit us to taking this course everywhere, and in regard to all classes of persons under our protection. No doubt, as a rule, the grounds on which such a claim is recognised in the case of His Majesty’s subjects, equally in the case of persons under His Majesty’s protection, but this ^/^aiwayi^o. Again, there are classes of persons entitled to our protection, but who do not choose to claim it, and whom it may be best to leave to their own devices. Further, there are some tribes on the confines of India whom we regard as in some sense under our protection, or at least within our sphere ol influence, but whose position with reference to us is not as yet clearly defined, and in regard to which questions of difficulty might arise. For these reasons Mr. Brodrick would prefer to wait and deal with each case as it arises with reference to its particular circumstances. 7. To turn now to the questions raised in Baghdad. Mr. Brodrick thinks it is by no means improbable, having regard to what is said in the enclosures to the Government of India’s letter, and in the letter of the 22nd February 1904 from the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople, that any objections which have been raised to our claim to exercise, in respect to subjects of the Indian Isative States and others under our protection, th© powers and jurisdiction which the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899 assumes us to possess, are simply the result of the ignorance or want of intelligence of the Turkish local officials ; and the course he would accordingly propose to take, unless indeed Lord Lansdowne feels any doubt as to the correctness of the assumption made in the Order in Council, is to request the Government of India to instruct the Consul-General at Baghdad that if in the ordinary course any case of the subject of an Indian Native State or other protected person comes before him to which the Order in Council applies, and which seems to him in other respects a proper one to be dealt with under that Order, he should not hesitate so to deal with it; and that if any serious difficulty is raised by the local officia’s he should consult the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court. /8. The questions referred to in the correspondence as to the acquisition bv persons under British protection of the Turkish nationality, and as to the °ll + n ' l° £ P erson . 3 who have not acquired that nationality, arc collateral matters, as to wh.ch Mr. Brodrick does not propose to issue any S instructions unless they should present themselves in a more definite shape • ' but ’ f. eem ' , th ® Turks P OS3e3s a regular naturalisation law, the former question ought to be a simpler one than it is Jxr h a :: ' i it 7 iI-X % -5 APR 1 X 4 •) X/ - No. 65 of 1904. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. EXTERNAL. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, Sis Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Fort William, the 17th March 1904. Sir, We have the honour to enclose copies of the papers noted in the accom panying list about the status enjoyed in Turkish territory by the subjects of N ative States in India, and to submit, for your consideration, our views as to the attitude that we should in future adopt iu regard to this subje ct in general, and as to the instructions that should be issued for the guidance of the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia in reply to his reference. 2. W’hen the same question was raised by our Political Resident at , , , , Baghdad in 1894, the Government of * Letter No. 1739 E., dated the 8th October 1894. basing ^ instructions 0 n the Foreign Office Circular, dated the 3rd July 1893, explained that the “ persons entitled to the protection of Her Majesty’s representatives in Turkish Arabia may be divided into two classes, viz.,— “ (a) British subjects who are entitled to all the protection which can be afforded them; and “ (b) persons enjoying Her Majesty’s protection whose rights have been generally defined in the Foreign Office Circular, dated the 3rd July 1893. The latter category includes all subjects of the several Princes and States in India, and such persons must, therefore, be treated as only entitled to protection under the Foreign Office Circular, and not as British subjects, whether they come from Kalat, Kashmir, Hyderabad, or elsewhere ”. It is on the subject of the l imitation imposed bj the Foreign Office instruc tions that we now address you, since we regard it as of importance that we should extend to the subjects of a protected Native State tjm same degree of protection as we claim to exercise in the case of British Indian subjects of the Crown. 3. Although the question has been raised in the present instance with particular reference to the subjects of one of the protected States of India in the Ottoman Dominions, it is one that affects the attitude of the Government of India in the case, for example, of Bajaurjs or Kashmiris in Kashgar, and also of His Majesty’s Government towards the subjects of foreign States-under British protection in other parts of the world. A protected State is one that has parted with all freedom of action in foreign affairs, and can have no direct relations or intercourse of any kind with another State, except through, or with the permission of, the protecting State, which thereby assumes a direct responsibility for the discharge of certain obligations. -liie 3senT~ 7^ &amp; logical sequence seems for to us to be that the protecting State must represent2 the protected State in all matters in respect of which the latter has surren dered liberty of international action, and, among other obligations, assumes entire responsibility for the protection of the subjects of such State abroad in the same degree as in the case of its own subjects. This doctrine is accepted by Germany, and German law goes so far as to allow the subjects of German Protectorates to be placed by Imperial ordinance on the same footing as German subjects with regard to the right of flying the Imperial flag. Prance has on more than one occasion claimed similar privileges in the case of persons who are not even the subjects of a State protected by her. TilJLj’ecently His Majesty’s Government has regarded the natives of their Protectorates as within the category of simple foreigners, but the Ottoman Order in Council of 1899 and section 15 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act ) of^ISDO are indications that there is a tendency to extend to them more and more the principle accepted by Germany. 4. Turning now to a consideration of the narrower issues with which we are immediately concerned, there are, it seems to us, two aspects of the question, the British and the international. From the point of view of the British law, there is, we think, no room for doubt, having regard to the definition of “ British subject ” in clause 3 of the Ottoman Order in Council, 1899, and the provisions of section 15 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act] s 1890, that, so far at least as concerns India, the subjects of the several Princes and States in India are “ British subjects ” within the meaning of the Order in Council. From the International point of view the case is not, perhaps, quite so clear; but it is, we consider, sustainable. His Majesty’s jurisdic tion in the Ottoman Empire is based, primarily, on the Capitulations, and there seems to be nothing either in the^Act or Order in Council to require any differentiation in the matter of jurisdiction between the subjects of Native States in India and ordinary British subjects, unless it can be shown, with reference to the Order in Council, that, in the case of the former, junsdiction has never been conceded to His Majesty by “ treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means ”. Indeed, it would seem that, if the Order in Council applies to British Indian subjects, and if we can claim to afford protection to these, it applies with equal force to “a native of any Pro tectorate” of His Majesty. It is possible that in 1809 the intention may have been to apply the provisions of the capitulations to “ subjects of England ” only (including, of course, such subjects in British India), but the views now gaining ground, and already adopted by Germany, were, we believe, unheard of then. Our relations with the Protected States have altered very materially in the past hundred years; and the Porte knows nothing to-day, internationally, of Hyderabad or Kashmir, except that they are under the protection of His Britannic Majesty. 5. We desire, in these circumstances, to urge upon His Majesty’s Govern ment the importance of laying down the principle that we may require the recognition by the Porte of the subjects of Indian Native' States as falling within the category of British subjects, as defined in the Order in Council of 1899, irrespegtive of the question, whether such recognition has in the past been accorded or not. If the assent of the Porte cannot be obtained in the case of such persons who may have acquired landed property and have permanently settled in the Turkish dominions, it might be sufficient to exclude such cases. At the same time we tbink that our officers should be instructed as to the language that they should hold in such questions. If, for example, jurisdiction were claimed over a Kashmiri, it should probably suffice to assert that a subject of Kashmir, when out of India, and for the purposes of our Conventions with the Porte, must be regarded as a British subject; since it might be undesirable to assert generally that Kashmiris were British subjects. 6. Ilis Majesty’s Government will no doubt consider the question whether it will be advisable, if it be decided to act upon our suggestions, formally to address the Porte in the matter, or whether it will be preferable merely to authorise us to instruct our officers in the sense that we have indicated, and to await the occurrence of an instance in which the Turkish authorities may object to the proceedings taken in pursuance of our orders.7. In conclusion, it is necessary to refer to, and dispose of, one point of detail which is raised in the correspondence which we enclose, namely, the suggestion, in paragraph 6 of Major Newmarch’s letter of 2nd Novemher 1903, y hat, in order to get over the difficulty presented by clause (iv) of Article 5 of the ——/* T)rder in Council, the Government of India should conclude formal agreements with the Native States on the subject. The adoption of this suggestion would, it seems to us, he most undesirable, as well as being entirely unnecessary. Even when there is, in such cases, no express delegation of power to the British Crown to legislate for the subjects of Native States abroad, such delegation is clearly Impfied'lDy the fact that we have consistently protected such subjects when outside the territorial limits of the protected States. To abandon this assumption would, we think, be to weaken our general position as regards our feudatories in dealing with European Powers by admitting that a further express delegation was necessary. It may hereafter be necessary to obtain such a formal agreement from the Amir of Afghanistan, who enjoys a different status from that held by the Native States in India, if he should ask us to extend the protection of our Ministers and Consular officers abroad to his subjects instead of their good offices alone. We do not, however, desire at present to raise this question.

Enclosures of a letter to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No, 60 , dated the 17th March 1904.: JL. /■ No. 702 ; dated Baghdad, the 2nd November 1903.' From— Major L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Protection accorded in Turkish Arabia to certain classes of persons, who are not natives of British India, but are connected with Native States in subordinate alliance with His Majesty the King- Emperor. I have the honour to address you in continuation of my letter No. 69, dated 9th February 1903, regarding the subject noted on the margin. 2. A few days ago at Kerbala two Kashmiris fell out: one threatened to kill the other at all hazards and subsequently repeated his threats in public. The other applied to the Consular Agent at Kerbala for protection. The Consular Agent confined the would-be assailant, recorded much evidence and referred to me for orders. After considerable hesitation, and seeing that the offender had been in confinement for several days, I directed his release. Nothing further has happened, neither party has preferred any complaint since and the matter is probably at an end. But the case involves many points which seem to me to be of importance. 3. Neither of these Kashmiris was registered, therefore under the provi sions of the Ottoman Order in Council, paragraph 165 (12), I had the oppor- : tunity of declining to recognise them as British subjects. I did not take this opportunity however and would rather have had the opportunity of acting in the contrary direction, but there were certain considerations which made me think it more prudent to leave the matter alone. In the first place the Turkish Government does not admit that Kashmiris are British subjects, and it even goes further, for its local officials in this part of the Turkish Empire oppose th e British prot ection of Kashmiris, and they have forbidden Kashmiris to buy or sell immoveable property except on the condition of becoming Ottoman subjects. In the year 1901 a Kashmiri at Kerbala wished to sell one-fourth of his house, but when he applied, in the way that is obligatory, to the Land Department for permission to do so he was told both verbally and in writinp^that ££ the people of Kashmir and Afghanistan are only under the protection of the British Government and as they have no King are considered as emigrants and Jbeing^ stroti^are Ottoman subjects,” and again he was informed in writing that ££ under orders received, persons who are Kashmiris and Afghans and wish to possess landed properties should as an obligation accept the Ottoman nationality.” 4. Lately, I have come across several cases of Pathans and even Punjabis who have become Turkish subjects probably under the influence of the Nakib here or perhaps for reasons like the foregoing, i.e.&gt; because their status as pro tected British subjects does not satisfy them. 5. The status of a protected British subject, who is a subject of a Native State in India, seems to me to be unsatisfactory. It is a very difficult and complicated subject, and the arguments connected with it are much better known to the Government of India than I could expound them. I do not wish to raise difficulties, but if any means could he found in India for giving such persons the full rights of British subjects, I think it would be very much to our advantage in a country like this. —* I do not refer to those persons who come to settle here without any inten tion of returning to India, but to those subjects of Native States who come here temporarily, for purposes of trade, pleasure, pilgrimage or religion. 6. As regards the latter class, I think it would he of great advantage to them, to the States from which they come, and to the British Government if the rulers of their States (I am thinking of the larger States in Central India and Rajputana and of the Mysore States) would make some formal agreement with the Government of India that, out of India, their subjects should be regarded as British subjects. The Turkish Government would probably be unable to refuse to recognise such an agreement, and it might serve to bind the Native States concerned a little more closely to the Government of India. I A /v_2 V/ think it would be of advantage if even a beginning could be made in this direction, for the number of such persons who travel beyond India is yearly increasing (the Begum of Bhopal is said to be going to Mecca), and I think it would be well if, when abroad, they could feel that they were reallv British subjects, and. not merely protected subjects. — Such protection is often unavoidably inadequate as, for example, in the case of Kashmiris here who are not allowed to buy or sell houses or lands. 7. To revert to the instance which has prompted this letter, I shall be glad to know whether I can try and dispose of such a case in the same way as if the parties were British subjects. I should also like to know whether I can enter- tam and deal witKcivil suits and criminal cases (1) between protected subjects, (2) between a British subject and a protected subject. If I cannot deal with such cases, the Turkish Courts will probably begin by assuming and end by claiming this jurisdiction. These are matters which should perhaps be referred by me to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, but I prefer to first indicate them to the Govern ment of India as being in my opinion the course they would probably prefer. /C ^ AS No. 741, dated Baghdad, the 10th November 1903. From— Major L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 702, dated 2nd November 1903, re^ardino the status in Turkish Arabia of protected British subjects who belonc^to the States of the British Empire in India, I have the honour to submit herewith for the consideration of the Government of India the copy of a letter on this sub ject which I have just received from Muhammad Hassan Mohsin, His Maiestv’s new Vice-Consul at Kerbala. J ^ 2. This letter is quite spontaneous and has no connection with my letter to you of the 2ndlNovember 1903. It seems that the difficulties I have brought to notice presented themselves to the Vice-Consul almost immediatelv on his taking charge of his office. 3. I have already instructed the late Consular Agent at Kerbala in accord ance with Foreign Department letter No. 1739-E., dated 8th October 1894, and I will now explain that letter further to Muhammad Hassan Mohsin, but it will be seen tbat the questions on which be asks for instructions go consider ably beyond the instructions already given. No. 282, dated the 3rd November 1903. From— Mirza Muhammad Hassan Mohsin, British Vice-Consul, Kerbala, To— Major L. S. Newmarch, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Baghdad. I have the honour to enquire for my future guidance as to the extent to which protection can be afforded by Consular Officers to natives of British protected States such as Kashmir, Kabul, Hyderabad Deccan, etc. 2. At Kerbala there are hundreds of Kashmiris, the majority of whom do not hold any paper showing that they are British subjects, but as they know that Kashmir is a State under British superintendence so they claim protection or rather assimilation to all other British Indian subjects. In the former case what protection means, what difference is there between a protected person and real subject, and what kind of paper is to be given to such persons to show that they are protected subjects ? 3. According to the rules we have in hand those who do not hold regis tration certificates are not recognised as British subjects (even if they are) and are accordingly rejected. It follows then, that all Kashmiris who are of course without any certificate are to be entirely discarded. If so, then what becomesof protection ? In explaining the above complicated question I request that the lollowmg items should kindly be answered— Where should criminal or civil suits between two Kashmiris be / x tri ed, in the Turkish or local Court ? (2) W here should criminal or civil suits between a British subiect and a Kashmiri be tried ? (3) Does a suit between a Turkish subject and Kashmiri which is tried in the lurkish Court require the attendance of the dragoman on behalf on the latter ? (1) Should^ the citation which the Turkish Courts usually serve on British subjects through their Consular officers be also served on Kashmiris with a view that they are either subjects or protected persons ? (5) Can a^ Consular Officer on the application of a Kashmiri, etc., for registration certificate or certificate of nationality grant the The local authorities look upon such people as sheep without a shepherd and have therefore forbidden them from buying or selling any landed proper ties in the Turkish Dominions. I request that the required instructions thereon should be given in order that I may know how to deal with them in future. No. 24, dated Baghdad, the 7th January 1904. From— Majou L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the information and consideration of the Government of India, the accompanying letter regarding the estate of a deceased Kashmiri woman who lately died intestate at Kerbala. 2. I am not myself satisfied with the instructions I have given to the Vice-Consul at Kerbala, but some instructions appeared to be immediately necessary and these seem to me the best that I can devise until I hear further from the Government of India or His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople to whom I am submitting this correspondence. 3. It is not at all clear to me to what kind and what extent of protection the property of a deceased protected British subject is entitled, in the event of the deceased dying intestate and in the absence of any claim for protection put forward by the heir or heirs. 4. It would, I think, be inexpedient to have any dispute with the Turkish authorities on this subject and equally inexpedient to alienate theMujtahids by any dispute with one of their number in such a case. 5. I am most reluctant to bring forward this question, and I would gladly leave it alone if possible, but it seems to me right to bring this case to the notice of the Government of India, if only that it may be recorded for future consideration. At the same time, although such matters look relatively small in India or in England, they look comparatively large here, and our action in connection with them has a considerable local effect which to some extent touches our prestige in these parts. '' ^—■— — No. 23, dated the 7th January 1904, From— Major L. S. Newmarch, Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Baghdad, To— Mirza Muhammad Hassan Mohsin, British Vice-Consul, Kerbala. I have the honour to reply to your letter No. 335, dated 19th December 1903, regarding a Kashmiri woman named Hajieh Fatmah. 2. It appears from your letter that she had been living in Kerbala for about eight years, and that on the 14th December 1903 she died there intestate and without h^irsrYou ascertained that she died possessed of 11 Liras in cash and of clothes worth about 1^ Liras. Soon after she died, the Mujtahid Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Mazandarani, son of the late Sheikh Zein-ul-Abdin, and one of the recipients of the Oudh Lequest, took possession of her estate and sold by auctioC''-' articles of small value belonging to the deceased. A\' In short he _ constituted himself the guardian and administrator of her personal esiate without your knowledge and without reference to you. 'When you heard of this action on his part you sent your dragoman to him to* claim in a very polite manner the custody of her effects and to tell him that according to the rules of your Government the property of the deceased should remain in your charge until it was disposed of as circumstances might require. The Mujtahid replied that he was acting in accordance with the Sharaa Law and that the property should remain in his possession, as an authority of that law, until the heir to the property was discovered, and he retained posses sion of the property. 1 You have subsequently heard that the deceased has nephews, one in Khorasan, of whom nothing is known, and another named Haji Ali Kashmiri who claims to be her heir. This information is however at present only hear say and has not yet been confirmed or proved. You are of opinion that the conduct of the Mujtahid is unprecedented and should not be allowed to pass unnoticed lest his example should be followed in other cases. 3. The deceased was of course not registered as a British subject and was * This contained the substance of Foreign only entitled during her lifetime to such Office letter No. 1739-E., dated the 8th October protection as is contemplated in the orders of the Government of India which were communicated to your predecessor in my letter * No. 44., dated 12th February Her nephew Haji Ali Kashmiri, if he is really a Kashmiri, is entitled to the same protection under the same orders, but he has not yet asked for such protection. ^ t * leS0 circumtances your intervention appears to me to have been a little unfortunate, though it was prompted by the best motives. I think that the action of the Mujtahid is probably ultra vires and such as would not be recognised by the Turkish authorities, but it seems to me toYe' inexpedient for us to refer the matter to those authorities because that might raise the difficult . question connected with protected subjects. ™ See 1 m L 8 n° me tllat in the circumstances your’best course is to visit the Mujtahid and tell him in conversation, of course quite politely, that you can in no way admit his claim to take charge of the property and that you only con sent to the property remaining in his charge, because you know him to be a trustworthy guardian and because no heir is at present forthcoming. If any heir should subsequently appear before you and claim the property of the deceased, you should tell the heir that the estate is too small to call for your forma! interference and that he should address himself directly to the Mujtahid frying to get satisfaction from him should apply to the Turkish authorities which in disputes between British and Persian subjects are the proper tribunal.* 6. In future and until I am in a position to give you more definite instruc tions you should avoid in all doubtful or disputed cases any interference with the estates of deceased protected British subjects, unless the heirs apply to you for help and you should then report the case in detail to me for orders.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003dd_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/24</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x0003dd</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/24</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 664/1904 'Turkish Arabia: Status of British Protected Persons'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1904/1911</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-25T09:09:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (201 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 201; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between British officials regarding the status of British-protected persons (primarily from the native states of India) within the territory of the Ottoman Empire.
