( Then why the hell inst S.N.O. on the distribution list ) From Political Bahrein. To Resident, Bushire. Bo. 92 Bated 20th July 1929. S.B.O.P.G. has sent me following undecypherable message. What is it in ? Following are first seven groups.3 D/0 No. 528 British Consulate, ( Shiraz, August 27th, 1929. /^tcry' Your private letter to Chick introducing your merchant friend Abdul Hamid Muhammad Sharif Awazi was handed to me yesterday by Abdul Hamid in person, and Chick being away on leave I opened it. Chick left Shiraz last April and it is not known yet when he will return 4 if he is returning at all, which is not certain. Abdul Hamid came to ask my opinion concerning a proposition made to him by the Russian 'SHARQ' Company here offering him their agency for Eanrein. Presumably they intend to have the Russian steamers,which now go to Bushire and Basrah, call at Bahrein and land sugar, piece-goods, soap, matches etc. for sale in the island. I gatiier that no Russian goods have reached Banrein hitherto, and that the permission of the Shaikh would 9 have to be obtained before the new departure could be made. I aavised Abdul Hamid to accept the Sharq Company’s agency and to have a clause put in the agree ment making it operative only when the Shaikh’s consent to the importation of Russian merchandise into Banrein had been secured. Abdul Hamid stated that the Russians had received offers from a dozen other Bahreini mer chants who were anxious to get the agency, and it appears to me highly advisable that the agency, if it is to be given at all, should be given to a respectable mercnant* well known to you, who will abstain from using his com- Captain C. G-. Prior, mercial Political Agent, &gt; ■ BAHREIN.p 0 mercial activities on behalf of the Russians as a cloak for propaganda. The fact that Abdul Hamid has an office and otner interests in Bombay would appear to offer a further security for his abstinence from Russian political activities in the Gulf. 4i? Of course, if you do not wish Abdul Hamid to accept the Sharq Company's agency, I have no doubt that he will drop it as soon as he hears from you; but you can under stand that from the purely trading point or view he is o anxious that, if any Russian agency is to be given in Bah rein, it-should be given tofhim. If the Russians fail to obtain permission for their boats to call at Bahrein and land cargo there, trie whole thing will naturally remain a dead letter; but in view of the fact that we have allowed 0 o their steamers to go to Basrah and have even allowed the we may not adopt a similar policy in Bahrein. Being a new comer to the south of Persia, I am not properly 'au fait' with Gulf affairs. and trespassing on your sphere, I can only ask your pardon. Ky excuse is that Abdul Hamid came to me with your letter and this little problem, asked my advice, and wanted an immediate answer. c C o establishment of a Russian agency there, I doubt whether © o If any of the foregoing looks life 'butting in'No. III.C / Office ofthe Political Agent* Bahrein, c/o Postaaster iCarachi. 18th September 1929.

Shaikh hamed considers that for commercial as well as political reasons this visit should be prevented. Local merchafcfes would be seriously injured by the competition with the Russians in o oil, piece goods and various other commodities. In addition to this H.S. Shaikh Hamed shares the feelings of his subjects in a* 0 ^ dislike of a people whose feelings on the subject of religion are » so little in accord with his own. H.S. Shaikh Hamed has given orders to his Police and Customs officials to the effect that should a Bolshevic steamer arrive no goods are to be landed and and no persons are to be allowed to come ashore H.S. Shaikh Hamed requests that you will communicate his decision to the proper quarters in order that if possible this vi.^it, and any other visits/may be prevented. I have the honour to be Sir.

There would be no necessity for the proclamation to give detail ed reasons. His Excellency^ view that it was not in the interest of the State being sufficient grounds to base it on. be issued almost immediately, for it is pos sible that Bahrain merchants, being unaware of His Excellency’s intention, might enter into commitments with Russian firms and suffer loss by being unable to take over their goods upon their arrival. that the matter is one for His Excellency to decide, it will only be necessary for me to inform Bushire of the action he has taken. 2.

Please refer to your letter &gt;To. 1''4? dated the 24th 1Toy ember 1929 forwarding a translation of a notification issued by the Bahrein government prohibiting the entry of Russian steamers into Bahrein. It would seem preferable that Notifications of this kind should issue over an \rab, rather than a British signature. If you can have this remedied in the present instance please do so; there is always a possibility tbmt a Russian steamer may one day come into Bahrein and the port authorities v-y.ll then have to show them the Notification when compelling them to leave. And as a genera^, prinei_^e it would be as well that Belgrave’s signature should not appear on notifications which affect foreigners.
