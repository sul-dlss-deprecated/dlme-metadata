We, therefore, wish for our survey Officer to visit Bahrein to collect outstanding data. Tentative arrangements nave, therefore, been made for Lieutenant I). W. price, R. 3. , to arrive in Banrein about the 15th December, to complete this work which, it is estimated, will occupy a period of not more than 14 days. The Survey Officer will be accompanied by one British N.C.0. and possibly an interpreter. This party will be entirely self-contained and will be accommodated in the R.A. F. Rest House. } To facilitate tnis officer’s work, it would be appreciated if the standard oil Company of California could put at our disposal any survey information as regards fixes and heights, wnich they may have collected. i would be much obliged if you could make enquiries from the Resident Manager on this point. We have not yet received definite Air Ministry sanction for the establishment of an Air Liaison Officer at Bahrein, but we have been told that we may expect confirmation on this point shox*tly. V/ill you please let us know if the arrangements made for the visit of the Survey party are agreable to you. Yours JlA.’LVrUtj Lieutenant Colonel P.G. Loch, C.I.3., Political Resident, Bahrein.!'

When I wrote my letter of even reference dated 17th November 1956, I was not aware that there was any suggestion of tne survey Department of India carrying out the Bahrein survey. This I am afraid, must be classified as a failure in our office organisa tion here^and nad I known about it, I would of course have let you know that this survey figured on the Survey programme for this command. 2. I enclose a copy of a D.O. letter sent to the R.P. G. by tne A.O. C. explaining the position. 5. I nope we nave not caused any confusion by failing to inform you earlier of our intentions.

On our programme for the 1956/57 period, m showed the compilation of an up-to-date mp of Bahrein as of the last priority. Latterly v,e have received instructions from the Air Hints try to proceed with this work, and it so happens that our Survoy Officer is in a position to spend two or throe knocks at Bahrein in mid-Poco:aher. This officer estimates that with the data available from our recent air survey and from the Standard oil Company, that a visit of about a fortnight will b© suiTXcient for him to collect all the nacesaury details. to have, therefore, written to Loeh at Bahrein informing him of the proposed visit of our survey Party about 16th heceElber, and asking him if he has any objections.
