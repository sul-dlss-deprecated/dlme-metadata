Aircraft reported to be badly damaged and under water but the crew of 4 persons unhurt. In accordance with instructions conveyed in Foreign Office Circular \1 18325/17401/49 of December 18th, 1939, I refrained from any reciuest to the Thai Government for the release of the crew dr of the .aircraft. ^But I mentioned the subject in conversation [with the Prime Minister who said he would order the release lof the^crew but that he preferred not to return the jaircraft to us. ^In this way he hoped to be less open to fthe charge of acting un-neutrally in liberating the crew. I reported the matter to the Air Officer Commanding R.A.F., Far East, who telegraphed back thanking the Prime Minister for his generous and friendly action and asking me to inform him that if any parts of the aircraft were still serviceable we hoped that the Thai air force would find them useful. I have notified the Minister for Foreign Affairs accordingly, for the information of the Prime 0 Minister. I think the latter's solution of the difficulty well suited to the existing circumstances and I hope that you v/ill approve. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me that the Thai local authorities have been instructed to furnish the crew with all facilities for return to Malaya.Prom Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* to Secretary of State for India.

On east coast of Musandam peninsula sloops made enquiries at coastal villages as far as Khor Fakhan. Political Officer, Trucial Coast, was also instructed to arrange for coastal search through the Sheikh of Kalha and Dibba. This obviated the need for formal approach to Muscat whose communications with this coast are very slow. 2. On the Trucial Coast side of the peninsula the Political Officer arranged general look-out in all Sheikhdoms from Shargah upwards. 3.

News of accident had unfortunately not yet reached the Ministry but Director-General promised to make urgent inquiries. Secretary-General was sympathetic but I think it probable that the Iranian Government on further consideration may take the line that neutrality obliges them to intern the crew. If so should I suggest the release against the undertaking to take no further part in the war. I will in any case try to obtain permission for doctor but he should be a civilian.
