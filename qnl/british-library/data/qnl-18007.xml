It primarily concerns the operations of the Indian Navy in the Persian Gulf; the movement of ships, the transfer of officers, and the payment of allowances.

                           Hugh Lindsay.The Euprhates Expedition is also a significant topic in the file; this concerns instructions related to moving the steamer
                           Euphratesto either Mahamerah, or Muscat so that it may be towed back to Bombay by the
                           Hugh Lindsay. The expedition is also attempting to raise the steamer
