Gunther is arriving with Political Resident. Aranhas departure should not be delayed if opportunity occurs.. Reference orders transferring me to Muscat. I beg to submit the following points for your kind consideration. (1) I have only been 7 months in Bahrain, have just settled down, and with great difficulty have managed to set up a home. As a married man this sudden transfer will cause me great inconvenience and some expense in breaking up a home and setting up aiother; (2) I will be put to a financial loss of Rs.16/- per month,(my present pay is Rs»206/- which will be reduced to Rs. 161/- plus free quarters which I am told are not suitable for married people) which with my small pay is proportionately a heavy loss and with the increased cost of living will make it almost impossible for me to make both ends meet. (3) Vty wife is under the treatment of Dr.(Miss) Barney and a transfer to Muscat will deprive her of this medical facility. I myself have been keeping very indifferent help to health and the climate of Muscat will not in any way^improve I would be most grateful therefore if my transfer to Muscat was cancelled.

On 16-1-1938, I wrote to the Secretary, Bushlre, calling his attentior to the fact that I had not received pay for 3 months, i.e. October, Fovr., end December. I don f t know what action was taken on this letter, but from their memo of 18.2.36, it would appear tnat my claim to Octobers and Movember T s pay has been overlooked. Under rules I am entitled to k average pay while on leave on M.C. provided such leave does not exceed 12 months. T have had only 7^ months medical leave, and therefore I cannot understand why Bushire have asked that fe 226/2/- should be recovered from me. ■Actually I am entitled to ns 283/- (which represents overdue pay for October and November) minus Rs 226/2/- In other words Rs 56/14/-. I have however written for an account of » Supply Bills cashed for me by the Gurgaon Treasury, and on receipt of this informatior:, which I hope vill Confirm that fact that I am still due pay for Oct. and Novr., the matter could i suggest be put before the Secretary.

Mr. Nicholes proceeded on leave on average pay for 15 days with the permission to affix Xmas holidays with effect from 28th November 1940 and his leave and joining time can be worked out as under :- (a) In transit between Bahrain and Karachi from 28-11-40 to 9-12-40 or 13-12-40. 16 day 28th December 1^40(i but thianwill^effeet bx with'permitsion t (b) His leave on average pay for 15 days expired on 25th or 940(if we allow him 16 days joining time Iffect his leave as he was granted leave 'permission to affix Xmas holidays). (O0&gt; XMas holidays from 25-12-40 or 28-12-40 to 1-1-41. (d) In transit from Karachi to Bahrain while returning from leave ... from 2-1-41 to 17-1-4l/ He should have reported here for duty on the 18th January 1941 in the forenoon.^ (e) ^e reported himself for duty on the 27-1-41 and thus has overstayed 8 days.. 2. Now the question arises that Mr. Nicholes in not aH permanent Government Servant, and had he been a permanent overstay^ of 8 days Government Servant ,/8 dayo3c«^x«XKyal»y-^r canld have been ( treated as leave on average pay. Now there is no alternativ except to treat his ■ overstay®* as on leave on private affairs, during which period he will be paid leave salary a- at half average pay » as contemplated in Rule 13,14 and 15 of the Revised leave Rules.^^ ^ ^ 3. May inform Secretary Bushire^accordinflyi s)«/v,~ ^ I'V ir n - ■ 'I \c o Mr.Aranha has only so far been paid from May,1942 onwards since his'return from leave in April ^last, as the question of overstayal of his leave and of Joining Time was being considered by Bushire. In his Office Order No.65, the Secretary has now decided that Mr.Aranha is to be treated as having been on leave without pay from 25th January to 2bth March 1942 and on joining time from 27th March to 10th April 1942. This means that (a) he is to refund, subject to Bushire^ approval, the leave salary he has already been paid by Bushire for the period 25.1.42 to 24.2,42. (His L.P.O.from Bushire shows him as having been paid up to 24.fi.42 (b) he is to be paid transit pay from 27.3.42 to 10.4.42 and duty pay from 11.4.42 to 30.4.42. With regard to (a), it is suggested that the matter maybe brought to the notice of the Secretary, as the above payment tewas made by him and relates to a period when Mr.Aranha was borne on Bushire Estt.
