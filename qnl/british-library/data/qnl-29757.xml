( T c/2190/l449/91) AMERICAN E’ffiASSY, y® 1, Grosvenor Square,V/.l 22nd March,1945. Dear Baxter, In confirmation of my conversation yesterday with Mr.Wikeley regarding American interests anc 5 consular representation in the Persian Gulf area, I wish to say that the Embassy has received an instruction from the Department of State referring to the discussions regarding Bahrain between Sir Maurice Peterson and Mr.Wallace Murray which took place in London on 12th April and 18th April,1944, and to a subsequent exchange of viev/s between the Embassy and the Foreign Office in June af last year(reference: your file E.3364/2521/91, 21st June, 1944), in consequence of whichthe foreign Office agreed: 1. To recognize an American interest in Bahrain. 2. To the inclusion of Bahrain in the Dhahran consular district as long as the consular o ficial there acts informally and without exequatur, and * 3. To facilitate the movements of American consular officials from Dhahran and the accomplishment of their duties, including the issuance of visas and assist ance in connection with transportation and communi cations. The Department of State observes that in the conversations between Sir Maurice Peterson and Mr. Murray satisfactory agreement would appear to have been reached in respect of American interests in Bahrain and the status of American consular representation there but that consideration was not given at that time to other Persian Gulf areas. By reasoning analogous to that used in the case of Bahrain, however,^ + he Department feels that an American interest also exis + s in &lt;5atar and the Trucisl Sheikhdoms, though of smaller magnitude than in Bahrain, and it recalls that in the case of Muscat the United States Government has maintained treaty relations with the Sultanate of Muscat for more than a century and that there are small American investments and a few American residents in that country. In the case of Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, no Americans are known to reside there, but it is held that an American interest exists in those areas by virtue of concession rights acquired by the Iraq Petroleum Company group in which the American holdings are equal to those of any other national group. In the circumstances the Embassy has been requested by the Department to seek from the Foreign Office its agreement to the' extension of the three points enumerated in the first paragraph above to apply to Qatar and the Crucial Cast as well as to Bahrain, at the same time extending the third^ point to Musdat. I may add in making this request that it is udderstood that the State Department has no plan for consular representation in any area of the Persian Gulf but merely desires to facilitate occasional visits by appropriate American officials to areas where American interests exist. C.W.Baxter, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., Foreign Office, S.W.l.In putting the foregoing before you I might make mention of several occurrences in recent months vrtiich would indicate that the clearing up of the points raised might serve to obviate misunderatanding between British and American officials in the Persian Gulf area. The first case had to do with a request made by the Amer ican Vice Consul at Dhahran to the British Poli + ica’l Agent at Bahrain for certain information relating to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The Political Agent was good enough to supply the in o^mation requested but is said to h»ve taken the occasion to state that he consi ered the Bahrain Petroleum Company to'be outside any legitimate interest o^ the State Department. Since the Department did not feel that this view v/as in conformity with the agreements which had previously oeen reached in London, it instructed the Vice Consul at Dhahran to inform the Political Agent that the Department did in fact regard the Bahrain Petroleum Company as an American interest in Bahrain in as muen as the company is wholy A^ercan owned. I understand that this message v/as communicated to the Political Agent, out no indication has been iic~ ved as to whether an understanding on the point was reached. The second case had to do with a trip which the American Vice Consul at Bahrain proposed taking last fall to Mu. cat with stopovers in Qatar and Sharja on the returh trip. The Vice Consul was impelled, however, to acanu^n his crip an^ to release the special airplane which he had obtained for the purpose - owing to difficulties encountered in obtaining t&gt;om the Political Agent at Bahrain visas for Qatar and the Trucial Coast and also in securing permission through him for the issuance of a visa for entry Tnto Muscat. It seems that one of the principal obstacles by which the Political Agent appears to have felt that his action was circumscrived at that time was the fact that he had not been informed of the inclusion of Muscat, Qatar and the Trucial Coast in the Dhahran consular district. Accordingly, the Department of State instructed the mission at Mew Delhi on 30th December 1944, to advise the Government of India that effective 15th October,1944, Oman(Muscat), Qatar and the Trucial Coast were informally placed under the jurisdiction o^ the Consulate at Dhahran. I I hope you will pardon me if I sepm to have expatiated at some length on what in substance is a very simple matter, i.e., to make certain that v/e see eye to eye in inter preting our previous agreements regarding Bahrain, narticularl as regards recognition^of an American interest in the Bahrain Petroleum Company; that the same agreements be extended by analogy to apply to Qatar and the Trucial Coast, and, finally, that In respect (f muscat the movements of American consular officials from Dhahran would be facilitated. Assuming that we find ourselves in agreement on these points, it is suggested that the Foreign Office and the State Department could then undertake so to inform our people in the field in order that there may be general understanding $11 around.
