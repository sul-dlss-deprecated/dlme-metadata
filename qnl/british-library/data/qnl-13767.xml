The letter discusses the news that the Tankseer Caun has surprised the town of Bushire and has begun by force to extort money from the inhabitants. William Digges Latouche and George Abraham state that Nassir, son of Masoon, sent them a message, informing them that he has sent 150 men to Carrack [Bandar-e ChƒÅrak] and that he would order them to rescue Beaumont from the town. Latouche and Abraham state that they have replied by stating that they are much obliged but that Beaumont would be the best judge as to what steps should be taken.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023598787.0x00004e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
