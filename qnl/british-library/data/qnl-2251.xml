Please explain to liter departmental Committee our full accept-mee that theirs is ultimate responsibility for Anti-locust Campaign. ( One sentence mutilated ). 2. At instigation of Chief LocuS,t Officer and others concerned with campaigns meeting of British and mat, government experts had been planned before arrival of your telegram 400 ? May 22nd . Timing to fit in with inauguration of Bast Africa Sudan and Middle Bast campaigns was first ? critical factor. Duration of conference also strictly limited by short interval between end of certain campaigns and beginning of others. Second difficulty which may not be fully realised by In ter de partment' 1 ! Committee is that mut .transport; air lines are congested with military and other urgent traffic and it is impossible to obtain passages at any one time for more than one or two persons. Cairo was therefore chosen as most central meeting point. Accommodation is a further consideration. Locust Officers have been consulted so far as corimunications permit and date fixed for July 2nd and July 3rd to avoid mut. campaigns. Discussions with British experts to take place for previous ‘2 or 3 days as requested by Locust Officers. 3.

Hoping that they are still in Bahrain I have asked Movements urgently to arrange their shipment;. Ine trucks required are No. 4721975 and the one exactly like it.

Please keep me informed what the position is so that I can raaiie a plan if any difficulties arise. A-s j. can do nothing till they arrive please do not fail to the nrmy!

Three of them, two Sudanese and the driver, Mohammad Ahaaa, were sent over to Al Khobar at the same time to collect tents, tools, etc., as they had been tola to do by either Maxwell-Darling or yourself. It is unfortunate that since the receipt of your letter,, on July SOtn,-v- ship/ no/xau&amp; has gone from here to either Sharjah or Dubai. Actually, I was expecting you to send me a wire to say when you we?e coming through Bahrain, so that I could meet you and discuss your various problems. Much trouole c*nd correspondence would have been saved had this been done. 3. There is still no sign of a ship going down to Sharjah or Dubai, and we are therefore noping to send your staff and -jaggo.ge on tho Shaikh of Dubai^s launch, which is at present rather vaguely scheduled to leave here aoout the 15th, unless a ship turns up befox it goes. Meanwnile I nave rianded over tnree of your boxes to the ^ H.A.F., who will send tnem to Sharjah by che next plane; they regret that they cannot take anything els$ at present. f)//f n r~% indeed i V&gt; , 4. There nas./ v been a mudule bver the trucks. Paragraph 7 of Maxwell-Darling*s memorandtffi of 14th June did say clearly that it was the 4‘’Fords with wooaen bodies that we&gt;re to be collected by Paiforce and that the two with iron bodies were to rema_in in Bahrain, but when we received your wire of July ^th from Cai*o, asking us to sena two Fords and two Dodges to Sharjah, the driver Mohammad Ahmad reportea that the only two Fords in working order were one iron booled ana one wooden boaied. I s accordingf^ sent tne tele ;ram, of which a copy is enclosed, on the i?th, and having •, received no reply by the 18th I g ave instructions that the only/ two Fords which Mohammad Ahmad reported to be in working order should be sent to Sharjah, flhat your wire of the 7th and paragraph 3 of your letter under reply mean I do not know, as M hammad Aiinad, who supervised the loading of the trucks into b. SilKwelyang', which took tnem to Sharjah, nas confirmed tnat he sent one iron and one wooden bodied FOJrdk. I am now sending one of our clerks to inspect - the four Fords left in the Fort here (of whose coi-Leotion by Paiforce 'a e have received no word,) to check up with the number you have given me and try and get tne mystery unravelled# 5. The trouble about the one remaining iron bodied Ford here is, accoraing to Mohammad Ahmad’s report, that it lacks three ^ big end bearingSgfDI sent nim up yesterday to s e whether he eouidp N get these out of (Thret. tonner and Fora engine left with Hewitt, ^ fT but he found nothing of use there.

I have just received a telegram from Axfir (Cairo ? ) that they are sendng a plane for locust reconnaissance here to Shar ja. Therfe^I thougnt tnat as there is a strong possibility that it will;call in at Baharain there might be an opportunity to send some or all of my lit and staff by tnis means. Should $rhis opportunity arise will you pleas* send in the following order of priority, my personal baggage (three tin boxas) ,my camp Icit, excluding tent, (two leather bags) and my cook box; This will enable me to start some treking here whihh I an unable to do at present being without any essentials. next in oraer of importance is Moh. Khal'aja. I dont imagine that there would be any room for anything else but if there was then pile in the balance of the staff and baggage. Please also let me Know at the earliest what the hold up ; if any^ there is with regard ta the other arrangements. Perhaps you have not got my letters but I should like to know if the Iron toodied Ford which should have been sent is out of commission or perhaps held up at Dharhan or what, when ± can expect my staff etc or if by any chance they have left you and been overcarried some where. If you ever got my request for 4000 /- ruppees ? If there is any trace of the missing parcel of spares ? Mol} With regaras to the Ford trucks, since I wrote on 8th. inst. I find that ho 4721975 was sent nere, correctly, but the R.A.F. nad it out wording the day I enquired. But I am still in the dark why the derilict old Ford was sent instead-of the sister trucx ofjwo 472t975. Uhiest tnere is any reason why this truck can not be sent please ship it at tne earliest opportunity. I can not remember the number of this truck, but it^easily regognised since it will be the only one with you which has an iron body. If my Sudanese are still with you they will know it as 'Abdul Jalil , s* truck. I am sorry to worry you witn all these matters but untill I hear something from you and know tnat there is no un- forseen.difficulty 1 dare not leave here atall.

If so would you please forward them to &amp;harja by the earliest opportunity. ' The spares in question were from B. O.D. P.A.

He can give no very gooa reason why but aomitts.that it is in the store and was with all my things which he brought. I think that it is now the only package left at Banrain so it should not be difficult to identify. It is a fairly large unpainted wooden box, badly stained with oil on top. Can you pleace get it to me as soon as possible, by air if you to Jerusalem wnicn 1 wrote to ypu about from Cairo? I have received no acknowledgement of its arrival at the other end.

A greatly increased Locust Campaign in Arabia is envisaged for next winter and spring. There vdll probably be three new British Locust Officers in tte M.B. Anti-Locust Unit, and it is hoped that units from Palestine and Egypt will again participate in the campaign in Saudi-Arabia - this plan would include Kbwait. as regards Oman, plans are being made for campaigns on the Batina Coast and in the Abu Dhabi - Ras el Khaima - baremi triangle on the Trucial Coast. South aid West of Abu Dhabi the rainfall is probably too light for much breeding to take place. At the mountain edge, south of Bareimi, political difficulties would probably make a campaign impracticable. If breeding took place there, and these difficulties could be over come, the campaign would of course be extended to those areas: Junior Technical Staff for Qnan is being provided by the Governmer. of India who will work under Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald. The campaign in Arabia will be co-ordinated by the Chief Locust Officer. A campaign against hoppers only is being enfisaged. you •win have heard from the Locust Officer, Persia, of th proposed operations against flying locusts as well as hoppers in the Persian littoral zone. 1 am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

On the 19th February 1944 Mr.Vesey Fitzgerald had an interview with me during which he asked whether there would be any objection to his entering the Buraimi Oasis and penetrating in the direction ^ of Ibri. Mr .Fitzgerald said that they had no information that locusti were breeding in that direction but that it was what he called a 'blind spot' and that they were very anxious to discover whether their theory that locusts breeding in the Yemen moved eastv/ards along the south coast of Arabia and then up behind the Oman range to the Ibri area was correct. Mr.Fitzgerald stated that he thought that another route followed by locusts was across the Ruba-^al-Khali to the Ibri area. 2. The anti-locusts people seemed to be delightfully vague about th&lt; possibility of breeding in the Buraimi-Ibri area, and*bout the capacity of locusts to fly for many hundreds of miles across the wastelands of South Arabia and the Ruba-al-Khali without the slight est chance of being able to obtain anything to eat. I received the impression that Mr.Fitzgerald was anxious to have something to show for his season's work which up to now, owing to the absence of locusts, has proved unproductive. The interior of Oman is virtually unexplored and it would certainly be something of an achievement outside anti-locust work if he succeeded in making a thorough examination of the area. 3. I had previously advised Mr.Fitzgerald that if he desired to enter A1 bu Shamis on Naim territory, he would do well to approach the Sultan of Muscat under whose suezerainty I have always under stood them to be. However I gathered from him that he was unabUe to obtain any satisfaction on his recent visit to Muscat as the Sultan had gone to Dhofar but that the Political Agent Muscat had given it as his opinion that the Sultan had no interest in A1 bu Shamis or the Naim and had even suggested that Mr.Fitzgerald make a direct approach to the Imam of Oman. I told Mr.Fitzgerald that I could scarcely credit that the Political Agent Muscat had in fact made any such statement and suggested that he took no such action. He also stated that the Political Agent, Muscat would shortly visit the Sultan in Ehofar and consult him on this point. 4. A recent visit by a small party of the anti-locust expedition to a part of the A1 bu Shamis property at Buraimi met with a rebuff. There are no locusts any-where in the area and the arrival of men in Khaki in army lorries with the stated object of being there to kill locusts which obviously do not exist is treated with a very justifiable suspicion. They are in fact no-welcomed. 5. I told Mr.Fitzgerald that I had no objection to him going as far as Ain in the Buraimi Oasis under the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi but that he should make no attempt to go beyond that point unless invited to do so or the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi agreed to be responsible for his protection. Re suggested that the Shaikh of Dubai might be able to help him peneterate further inland and I said that I saw no objection to his entering Dubai date gardens at Buraimi provided the same protection was guaranteed. I further stated that the P.O.T.C. would make any arrangements that Mr.Vesey Fitzgerald might desire with regard to his travelling from Abu Dhabi to Ain. 23-2-44%?* ^ - Political Hesidcnt, ous hi re • poltical Agent, Bahrain.

I have been asked by r ^a f jor Macadams of the United States Army if I can inform him of the whereabouts of five Ford irries Nos. 14540611, L4640608, 4541590, L454060S and L4539467. It seems that negotiations, of which I have no record, have been in progress with a view to the vehicles being taken over by the Bahrain Government from PAIFORCE. I now ’and or stand that T 'a jor ? f acadams has received authority from the Persia-Iraq Command to sell the vehicles to the Bahrain Government for £ 350/- each. I shall be glad to know if you have any information on the subject and arc aware of the rrcsent location of the lorries '• be JLgJ- Cl ^ ^ 7 Adviser to the Government of Bahrain » • _ BahrainD.O.No. 855-51SF. Adviserate, April 26, 1944. Regarding the enquiry in your D.O.No.1115-36/56 dated 20th April, 1944, about five Ford lorries. The five lorries referred to by you belonged to the Anti- Locust party working in Saudi Arabia they broke down on the desert and became derelict. I was asked by Wakefield and by Maxwell Darling to help find a place in Bahiain where they could be stored and I offered to keep them at the Fort. They were brought across and stored at the Fort when I was on leave. In the Autumn, when we were having great difficulty over transport, especially in connection with the Special and State Police, the Defence Officer in the Persian Gulf suggested that it might be possible for us to obtain some of these unserviceable lorries out of which we could fix up one for working. For two years we had been trying to obtain one or more lorries from India, but with no success. I enquired from the Defence Officer in the Persian Gulf whether the authorities would allow the Bahrain Government to buy two of the five trucks, none of them being in working condition, later I suggested that we should, if possible, be allowed to acquire all five of them in order to cannibalise the five and to reconstruct two or three of them. In January 1944, the vehicles were inspected by a military officer from, I think, Iraq who saw them at the Fort with the State Engineer. It was his opinion that the vehicles could be cannibalised so that three serviceable trucks could be made out of the five trucks. It was suggested by him that we should buy certain spares for the trucks which I understood could be supplied from military sources. I was informed verbally by the Defence Officer in the Persian Gulf that approval for the acqui sition of the trucks by the Bahrain Government had gone through; one of the trucks has now been put into working order and a second one will be ready shortly. The trucks are urgently needed by the Bahrain Government and in view of the present transport situation the price is acceptable. Najor T. Hickinbotham, C.I.S., O.B.E., H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.Telegram From To No 39S # Political fgent, ^ehrain* Political Resident, Pushire Dated 27th /pril^ 1944. z? £ The American works Liaison Officer here informed me on the 19th of /pril that he had been instructed by the Persian Gulf Service Command to obtain payment for five motor lorries which had been handed over to tne Pahrain Government by PAIC. The cost of the lorries is to be £ £50 each. He enquired who had charge of the lorries and with whom he should deal in this matter. I informed him that he should deal with me end that I would make enquiries. 2 . /s I had no record of this transection 1 made enquiries from the Adviser who informed me that the Bahrain Government in 1943 acceded to a request of the /nti-Locust Mission to store the vehicles as they were no longer serviceable. Last Autumn the Station Commander suggested that it might ^e possible to make some of the lorries serviceable by using parts from the others as transport was urgently required for the Special and State Police. The Adviser suggested to the Station Commander that the Bahrain Government should scouire all the five vehicles and use them for this purpose. In'January 1944 the vehicles were inspected by a military officer and later the Station Commander informed the Adviser that their acquisition by the Bahrain Government had been approved. £. The whole of this transaction v. r as carried out without my knowledge but Jackson w r hom I discussed the matter with informed me that he believed that there was some record of it on your files. As the Pahrain Government are in urgent heed of transport and are anxious to acquire the vehicles at the price quoted I suggest that our approve!, though somewhat belated, be accorded to the transaction. •POLITICAL- ICHi 4 3rd my 1944» D«0*Ho.

During the first half of the month there were very few adults of the first Arabia generation in the Ras al Khaima district No- swarm developed. At wide intervals there were a few scattered 'solitary' hoppers, but otherwise reports from all districts were il. The report of locusts at Llwa was -investigated and it was ascertained that no breeding occurred there this year. Ocnt_rc_l. The Oman campaign was successfully closed on 4th March. All Field parties assembled at Sharja during the next week? the equipment was sa ‘el. stprec in*Sharja and 'B' platoon, together' with the Locust Officer* left ’for Saudi Arabia on the 44th. Arran g ements for future work in Oman . 8 x 3-ton and 2 x 15-cwt cars were left at Sharja to meet any eventuality which might arise. The Indian delegation re turned from Muscat and is staying at Sharja until the end of march when they wilx return to India if no locusts appear. Cue Icoaily recruited supervisor has been stationed at Sharja to report locust news and handle any M.E.A.L. . work in Oman, No news has been received from Oman since yhe I. h- left. Politiaalv With the close of the season's work in Oman I would like to str-ess the desirability of giving presents to the various helpful Shaikhs. A memorandum has been submitted on this point end any decision reached is awaited with interest. The- P.A. Muscat very iindly talked with H.H. The Sultan, on the subject of visiting the interior of Oman. While I understand that the Sultan's attitude was favourable? I still await a report on t .ese conversations. For the time being, a visit to that country has had to be -postponed owing to other work ir: Saudi Arabia.

Immature swarms were reported streaming east wards over central Arabia (just north of Lat. 24, as early as 15 th. By 22nd arrivals were noted on the east coast from- Selwa to Dhahran« includin. Bahrein. Upon reaching the coast the direction of flight'./as difficult to ascertain? but an east ward flight towards Oman was noted on 25th at the base of the Qatar peninsula* and a no-rthward flight towards Euwm.it by the 2 f 7 tL&lt; across country which was reported clear of locusts on 21 s The eastern locust pax by has suffered from several mis- farti res indecisions* changes of policy and- pth-er mishaps* vhich left, the area without any Locust Officer,, for a period* and now the rapidly developing'situation has left little time for re-organisation. However* the arrival of Harry' Darling from Nr si a* and the return of the Oman party* has eased the situation? and active control is gaining momentum. marry Darling is located at Rumahiya to work tne Dbahana. Succe-smfil control is in progress* but the full extent of the infestation is not yet known* but ib is believed to be only me derate. It Is anticipated that he will soon be able to enteikr his area or lend *eTp elsewhere. — Memo ugh* accompanied by Keatinge* should be established near Anaiza by the close of the month* to work the ingested sands to. the south where Harry Darling has already established some pioneer parties. Th degree of - infestation here has not been felly assessed* but is believed tq.be fairly severe. Arabia east of the Dahana and Qata* was free of locusts until the arrival of the s\ arms noted above. The whole coastal one from Oman (except a restricted area immediately east of ohe Sacakh Matti) tc Lat.‘27° including Qata? is believed to be too dry for serious breed!, g. Rainfall at Dhahran has been as follows: Hoy. 19th 0.82’ ! ; Deo. 8th-l0th 0.82'; -Jan 6 th 0.6 ’' 0T* and on four other days* a trace; February Nil; March Nil.

VESKY FT Locust Offinpr . : or April 1^4.1 . Locust t'iovenients. Jr ^ xhe _movement» which is thought to have originated in Western Arabia and was noted during the latter half of March, continued uring early April. Details-of swarms have been sent in with district reports- and these are not repeated here. Loose im mature swarms are reported to have covered the Trucial Coast from , 6 2 5th Larch. ihese insects were rapidly becoming mature but e country is said to b.e.too dry Lor breedings which is probably correct. A large swarm was drowned in the Gulf. The swarms reached Persia during the second half of March and Kuwait by 8th April. in each case yellowing was’reported. Some yellow squadrons’» females with ripe eggs* were seen near Buraida on fa . which may have been stragglers from this movement and oviposition has been reported from Central Arabia. The Hassa» Bahrain^and Kuwait became free of locusts towards the end of April with no report of breeding having taken place. ^ movement* originating in escapees from the campaign noted in his report* developed and gained momentum during the last half of the month. The Campaign . Wat erston at Hail has been heavily engaged during the month, f las trled _ to handle a. very largo area in the most remote part' of Arabic which was clearly an impossible t-’sk with the staff and ransport available to. him. He has therefore concentrated his ' extorts along the southern fringe of the Great Nafud- Jobel Salme. end southwards on the Medina road to around the northern tribu- tories of the Wady Rumma. He is working on vast plains of grass broken by ragged mountain ranges. Pho country'is good for motoring, but hopper otten hrrd to locate, and immigration from the mountains and Nafud sends has necessitated repeated treatment of the a.reas. Daily wind has interfered with the work, and bait was being wasted by the Sudanese who were trying to control too.many throw- e r s • The length of the supply linp has prevented an adequate amount of bait being delivered* e^and several valuable days’ work were lost through lack of bait. A splendid rosponsawas forth coming from the G.T. Coys to rectify this state of affairs* ahd 44- speeded up their 10-ton convoys while 38 organised the relief of^Hail from east coast stocks of bait. Unfortunately heavy r.ein during the middle of the month hold up transport* but by the end of the month the Hail bait position was sound. Trenching was tried as a ’stop gap’ measure* but with only limited success owing to- the stony nature of the soil and a shortage of tools. ^Hatching took place in this abea as early as 20th February and it must oe attributed to the success ot the control that the majority /2 v'VVi ~\ majority of the hoppers were still only in 3-4-5 ihstar during the present month. Restricted hatching continued* and a few fliers appeared on the, 11th April* their number increasing to wards the end of the month. It is to be for red some swarms will get away from areas where treatment has not been possible* though new areas were undertaken as the work eased off in the main areas. The untreated area may be large since hoppers have been reported all the way to Sakaka* though it is thought that work is being carried out in the places with the highest hopper population. In a few local ities scattered hopoers with ’solit iry ’ colouration 7 ;ere seen* and old yellow adults were often found among the hopper bands. Hodder and ha:: san Idris have built up a splendid organisa tion which they have used for combating dense'bands of old hoppers. From the beginning of the campaign* Hodder‘has been behind his programme. First of all he had to'cover the country left open by the late arrival of the- Egyptians* which caused Jodgn to arrive.late in his own area. However* he established his K.Q. at Hanakiya during the early part of the month. He is now working steadily north and N.W. over stony country -&gt;elow ranges of hills drained by many wadis. The vegetation Is mostly in tuese wadis and on it the older hoppers assembled* which somewhat facilitated the work. Tho hopper incidence was very high. Hodder has sacrificed several bait loads to help Waterston* which held up his own work slightly. But the -success of his operations against both hoppers and ’fledglings' has been most spectacular. From a personal tour of the district* I can sub stantiate his claim of 100 per cent. So successful have opera tions been against fledglings* that I consider- there is still a good chance of a very big kill being made* though fliers were appearing in great numbers during the middle of the month. It is to be feared Hodder will-not be able to reach Water- ston’s frontier on the Wady Rumma in time to carry out useful/^ control* and there will bo areas in the Rumma valley to the east which will escape treatment. On 17th April a very loose swarm 25 x 10 miles was already leaving Long. 42°00- Lat. 25°55 for the month. McGough is est:blished at Mudhnib* south of Anaiza* and is working in country of rolling red sand dunes. Mo boring’was difficult until the mid-month rain* and supervision ar.r, scouting difficult in the many sandy*valleys. His supplies have been well maintained and.the hopper incidence is probably not so high as in the-west. - He has made some good kills* and I saw few hopper bands when I toured his district dur ing the middle of the month. Fliers started- to appear about the 17th April and he is now 1 endeavouring to cover new 1 territory where he fears big untreated bands may be escaping control. Keatinge* who was working with McGough* wa: beginning of the month. re cal Led at the Harry Barling based on Rumahiya* has been working the Aruma plateau west of the Dahana. His work increased suddenly early in the month by the discovery of large bands around Hafar el Atj a nd / %- 3 - and Artawiya. But about the 20th April work in the Dahana* east of 47°’ closed with a 100 per cent kill of a light infesta tion. It was not necessary to penetrate far into the Dahana sands* since the hoppers marched out on to the stony plain to the west* and concentrated in wadis. All this country is excellent for motoring. A special effort was made to achieve successful con trol at Hafar el At j since the King was encamped there the whole time. At least 70 per cent success was obtained over the wliole worked area* and it is thought also that a great number of hoppers perished when the wadis came down in flood during the - mid-month raise. ’The onset of the hot weather brought the campaign in the east* to a sharp close at the end of the month* when only very few 5th instar hoppers remained* and the young adult population* though widespread* was extremely dispersed and it is to be hoped only a medium sized swarm will escape. The misfortunes of the early part of the campaign in the east were never fully rectified. By the time Harry Barling arrived* work was too far advanced to allow full scouting’of the district. No hoppers escaped south'of the H.Q. camp* and but few to the east of the Aruma plateau* though serious breed ing may have occurred in the northern Bahana. Now that control has eased* scouting parties have set off to check these areas. Harry Barling was recalled to Persia at the end of the month and he leaves on 2nd May. Lt. Harley* kindly lent by Major Leney* has taken over the district. Heavy showers fell during the middle of the month which held up transport all over the country. The onset of hot weather immediately afterwards* scon dried up the ground and the vege tation has received little benefit from the rain. The rain may have killed many hoppers and the ensuing hot weather has accelerated development. The campaign shows signs of drawing to an early close* and it is anticipated the recent reports of oviposit ion will not amount to much. Active work may cease during the first half of May but some scouting trips will he necessary in order to assess the full value of the campaign. It appears that M.E.A.L.U. will be ready to leave Arabia by the end of May at the latest. Place Names .

Aircrews are in a position to furnish otherwise unobtainable information on the movements of these swarms and by their ready co-operation much valuable knowledge can be obtained to assist in the combating of the Locust plague throughout the Middle East. In particular Locust information is urgently required regarding ETHIOPIA and SOUTHERN S-UDI ARABIA about which very little is at present known. 2 , It is appreciated that aircraft in transit will only sight Locust swarms on the move on very rare occasions, but, when encountered, the Captain of the aircraft should report the occurrence to Flying Control or the Duty Pilot at the first airfield of landing. The information required from aircrews is shewn at appendix 'A”. 3 , All Flying Control officers or Duty Pilots are to enquire from the Captain of aircraft as to whether or not any Locust swarms have been sighted. Information received is to be passed by the quickest means available either to the nearest Locust or Political Officer, or through this Headquarters to the Middle East Supply Centre. A list of officials to whom Locust reports should be sent is at Appendix ■*3' • 4, Attention is also drawn to MERO.749/42 which outlines the procedure for the reporting of Locusts by units.

In filling the vacancies of Locust Officers it might be advisable to approach the Grasshopper Control Division, U.S. Department of Agriculturewith a view to obtaining the services of one or two Americans. ?l American experts were to be loaned, it would be essential that their services should be available for the full period of the campaign 0 Provisional estimates of numbers of vehicles and other equipment have been prepared for pecoi.&lt;mendntion to military authorities. The headquarters of the organisation should be at Jedda where close contact can be maintained with the Saudi Govern ment through the hritish Legation. The actual Operations in Arabia should be carried out in Decern be r/Jurie and it is essen.tial that transport etc should be ready by the end of October c Recon naissance units should oe in the field from early October onwards,, Supervisory staff, which it is proposed to recruit mainly in the Sudan, should be trained in that country during July/September„ Persia.. It is essential that the organisation of operations in Persia should continue to be such as co make the Persians feel they are taxing full part in it. In the coastal zone it might^e possible to adopt an organisation on Arabian lines, consisting f civilian labour with military transport and British ana Persian Locust Officers and supervisory staff. P Locust officers are required, one o f ' whom might be an American,, An administrative Officer at Basra is required, to relieve the Locust Officers from being concerned with supplies, transport, etc. One or two aircraft for communication purposes and a motor launch will be required. Lxperimental work on this method or control has established that D.R.O.C. is an effective contact poison in doses which ha'e little adverse effect on vegetation; but the technical and organisational difficulties involved in adopting the tuethod are such as to suggest that this method cannot be recommended for immediate application on a large scale. Yet the practical advantages of the aircraft method for killing locusts as against killing hoppers are v^ry great and it^ would appear that there js reasonable prospect of these dilliculties being overcome after a further period of experimen tation with the assistance of experts of the ^ix* Auinistry, Ministry of Aircraft Production aj,u other competent bodies. Continued investigations should aim at improving the poison, finding the most suitable type of aircraft, devising a better distributing apparatus, studying the organisation required and investigating the conditions affecting the behaviour of locust swarms. Except fer the last point which would require several months of field study by a trained entomologist, the rest of the programme could be carried out in this country. The difficulties attaching to this method of control might conceivably be resolved in time for it to be used even in the present scries of campaigns, and it would prove invaluable should outbreaks of other locusts develop. If, oy uhe conclusion of hostilities, the method had boon thoroughly studied and the difficulties overcome, its large scale application would be perfectly feasic-le, since the present difficulties in obtaining numbers of suitable aircraft and trained personnel would be removed. .(b) Poison for baiting . n search for a substitute poison for' sodium arsenlte is in progress, which would appear to offer success- u 1 e suits. when uhe tests on the substitute are couple te it nay become possible to recommend it as a substitute for sodium arsenite, Experimental worx.

In view of large numbers of troops and other subsidiary personnel involved in the campaigns, it would appear desirable to produce a pamphlet giving an outline of the nauiss of locusts, principles of their control and aims of the i resent . c a tig a i gh. The pamphlet should ue written in simple,, non^technical language and illustrated by a coloured plate showing different stages of the locust.

Pur Cher to our a '10602/29 of l?th May 1944, we wish to explain that this new attempt to obtain locust reports from air sources has been made because past attempts so largely failed. The failure was due to the appeal being too general, the/ system too dispersed and above all, to the lack of direct contact between the appropriate localair representatives and the local locust authorities. 2 . The new scheme can only bring better res tils if locust authorities on the spot will take the initiative and approach personally, thejr local 11*A.f., U.S.A.A.P. andl.O.A.C. stations, quoting instructions issued to the latter by their own higher formations, copies of v-hich in the case of the B.A.F., were circulated with c tvabove quoted letter. 3. would be greatly appreciated if you conic! request the Political Agent, at Bahrein and the Political Officers at Sharja and Salala, to establish the necessary contact with rir stations ir their vicinity with a view to obtaining and passing on the information required by t is centre.

The Director of Recruitment, (Colonial Service), Colonial Office, 2, Park Street, London, W*l. 25th July, 1944. Dear Wood, Locusts. May I remind you of the recommendations of the recent conference, which were sent to you under cover of I.D.C.L.C./50, General Strategic Plan, Arabia. You will remember that the Committee recommended that in their view in Oman the collaboration of the Government of India would be required in the next campaign: also, as regards Persia, they recommended that the Government of India might be asked to take over responsibility for operations in the Persian Mekran. While we propose to leave it t© the new Chief Locust Officer, Mr.O.B.Lean (who was in charge of anti-locust operations in Persia last year) to make contact with India as he has dons in the past, we should be very grateful for any help that you can give in furthering the pros- t pects ©f effective collaboration in principle. We cannot attempt at this end, I think, to go into details. v J You will, I take it, be sending out copies of these ^ recommendations, of which I enclose three asked for by Miss Odgers. Perhaps you will be good enough to pass them on to her. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) DenAis Garson?s'74- 8 th September, 1944* Dear Caree, With reference to my letter Ne•3233/44 of the 21st July, forwarding the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee on locust Control for 1944-45, I enclose a copy of correspondence with the Colonial Office on (From Colonial Office dated 25.7.44.

(EISM !l. j; ^t. this subject• H.M.G would of course welcome any collaboration which the Government of India may feel able t© give, particularly as regards operations in Persian Mekran and Oman. We understand, however, that the whole subject will be discussed at a meeting of the Tehran International Locust Control Committee in India next month as a result of which no doubt mere concrete proposals will emerge, • As regards the question of approaching the Sultan of Muscat for his co-operation, we were rather doubtful whether it would worth while saying anything to him until proposals have taken more definite shape, but in view of the Colonial Office^ request we should bo glad if* it could be considered whether anything could be done now to secure his co-operation in advance, in any operat ions that may prove necessary. If yourself and Prior see no objection tk this being done without delay, perhaps arrangements could be made for the Sultan to be approached accordingly. I am sending a copy of this letter te Prior.

GEi^bU^i-.. 27. It is proposed to divide the Arabian campaign into the following divisions J a) Saudi Arabia - Covering the coastal area of AbIR, D (between Lets.22° and 29°), the h^oA and KUWIT, To be undertaken by British Units. (b) Oman - Including ThUCIaL okAR, bAivAlkl and the BatIRA COAST south to Muscat. To be undertaken by Indian Units under the direction of a British Locust Officer. (c) Hedjaz and Yemen - Both campaigns to be under taken by Egyptian Units, co-operating with k.E.A.u.U,, in the coastal areas and as far inland as possible. (d) Aden • Any necessary campaign will be undertaken by the local administration. 28. The organisations in each division must be as flexible as possible as the principal areas likely to be infested with hoppers will depend upon the seasonal rainfall which is extremely variable and unpredictable. 29. Owing to the shortage of transport and personnel, it may be impossible to organise a full campaign as 3a st year and, therefore, alternative schemes have been prepared for 8AUDI ARABIA and OMAN, viz*- Plan A - Full campaign, with military opefathg transport. Plan B - Reduced campaign, designed to combat early breeding only on the East and West coasts, with transport operated by civilian drivers under M.E.A.u.U. administration. Plan C - No attempt at a controlcampai^n but only reconnaissance parties covering ARABIA as widely as possible to secure information on the development of the locust cycle and to stimulate local interest in locust control. V. 8AUDI ARABIAN CAMPAIGN fPlan L ) General Organisation 30. It is proposed to run this campaign on similar lines to the corresponding campaign last year. The main difference will be that the entire campaign will be administered from a single H.Q. at JEDDA where the Senior Locust Officer or his Deputy will be in constant touch with the Saudi Govern ment through the British Legation. Should any work be necessary in KUWAIT, the Locust Officer', E. Arabia, will make arrangements through the Political Agent, Kuwait. 31. An M.E.S.C. Liaison Officer should be stationed at Jedda to act as link between the expeditions and Cairo and to handle all supply questions.*52. As last year, it is proposed that two G.T* Companies, or their corresponding number of vehicles, should be respon sible for movement of all stores, equipment and personnel under the direction of the Senior Locust Officer. Actual control operations will be undertaken by local Saudi labour, paid by us, supervised by Sudanese and Saudi leaders with previous experience, working under six British Locust Officers, each of whom would be responsible for an area allocated by the Senior Locust Officer. 33. During the first phase of the campaign operations are likely to be confined tothe coastal areas of ASIh where the first immigrating swarms may be expected to breed. A successful campaign here and in the other areas of the Red Sea coast might markedly reduce any later infestation in central ARABIA. 34. Breeding may commence in ASIR from early in January and last till approximately April. Advance reconnaissance parties should be in position as soon as possible after October 1st. 35. During the second phase units should be prepared to move into central Arabia as breeding spreads inland. No attempt can be made at this stage to define operational areas and the whole organisation must remain sufficiently fluid, without permanent camps, to deal with the changing situation as it develops, on the orders of the Senior Locust Officer who will be kept informed by advance reconnaissance parties. All operations are likely to cease in May or early June. Trans port. 36. The following are the estimated total requirements of the British Saudi Arabian and Oman divisionst- 10 tenners 66 3 tonners 200 approx. 8 cwt. 34, including 16 w/t vehicles Bantams 33+3 trailers M.B.A.L.U. staff, it being necessary for each of the seven Locust Officers to be able to move independently and to maintain contact with H.Q. at JRDLA, and also for the Sudanese Supervisors who require their own transport for visiting working gangs Cars Total Plus: Water carriers Workshops Stores Breakdowns Ambulances Slave battery 16 8 8 8 6 vehicle Total 1 4? 37. Of the above, the following will be required by 8 cwt. Bantams 14, including 7 w/t vehicles 2738. During the previous Arabian campaign (November-June), a corresponding fleet of 358 vehicles covered a total of 2,700,000 miles with approximate total petrol consumption of 7|5,000 gallons. Locust Poison. 39. The whole campaign will be run on prepared bait ex Khartoum. Estimated total requirements are 30,000 sacks (1000 tons). Of this the following quantities are already in positions- Jedda 1729 bags Hail 2868 bags El Kharj 3000 Kuwait 3000 A1 Khobar 341 Sharjah 2300 Total 13238 40. Future shipments should be divided between the ea' and west coasts, the earliest consignments going to the Ht Rations. 41. Rations will be required for approximately the following's- Locust Officers and Junion L.Os. 8 Sudanese Staff 70 Miscellaneous Stores. 42. Some supplies of tentage, water containers, etc. are available at various depots, i.e. Yenbo or Jedda, Sharjah and A1 Khobar, but deficiencies must be made up. j VI. OMAN CAMPAIGN (Plan A) . General Organisation. 43. This campaign will be undertaken by a unit consisting of junior Indian Locust Officers (probably 4 plus 5 assistants) working under a British Locust Officer, under the direction of the Senior Locust Officer. Arabia. As in Saudi Arabia, transport will be operated by the Military. 44. The unit will be primarily responsible for observations and control in Trucial Oman, Baraimi and the Batina Coast, but should be prepared to move elsewhere, particularly towards the Hasa, if required. 45. H.Q. will be at Sharjah with a base for operations on the Batinah at Muscat. 46. The main campaign will last approximately from January until April, but a second campaign might possibly be needed to deal with further breeding during May and June. Transport. 47. Of the y' ^Sansport requirements detailed in paragraph^ 36, the folio' required by the Oman divisions- ^2?4 (a) For MEALU Staff and actual locust operationss- 3 tonners 8 cwt. Bantams 20 1 3+1 trailer Total 24 (b) Necessary domestic vehicles to maintain above unit Locust Poison 48. The dump of 2300 sacks prepared bait now at Sharjah should be sufficient for a normal campaign. Rations. 49. Rations will be required for approximately the followings- v . -J* 50. The Indian Staff should bring all their rations from India Miscellaneous. Communications. 52. Normal communications should be through MESC(L) Basrah to Cairo. Urgent signal for Persia, e.g. Reports of swarms flying northward, should be sent through R.A.F. Sharjah to the MEALU Unit, Bandar Abbas. Parties working on the Batinah should be able to send messages through the Political Agent, Muscat, when convenient. coastal areas of Asir and the Trucial and Batinah coasts of Oman, with the possibility of extending operations against e breeding in the Rasa and in certain parts of Nejd where bait dumps are already established. General Organisation. politically, it would not be possible to operate this plan with a single H.Q. and resources would have to be divided. The Senior Locust Officer would still be responsible for the administration and co-ordination of both campaigns and he would divide his time between the two areas. He should be provided with a W/T Unit to maintain communications. 55. The MESC Liaison Officers would still be required at Jedda and Basrah and the former should be provided with a w/T Unit to act as link between the field parties, the British Legation, the Saudi Government and Cairo. 56. Locust control operations will be carried out and super vised as in Plan A (Paragraph 32). 57. Transport will be the responsibility of MEALU t nucleus maintenance staff of British military technici workshops officer should be attached. Drivers will be locally.

Beyond this, further shipments should be stopped if we are forced to adopt this plan. Transport. 60. The following would be the minimum requirements of vehicles:- 3 tonners (Chev.C60L) 60 8 cwt. (Chev.desert cars) 12, including 5 W/T vehs. Bantams 15+3 trailers * Total 87 Plus vehicles for the medical unit and workshops, full scale MT stores and Breakdown (adequate to recover 3 tonners v from long distances over rough country), suitable for above fleet divided into three separate detachments. 61. Two detachments would work on the west coast and one on the east. P.O.L. 62. It is believed that adequate stocks P.O.L. are available at Jedda, Sharjah, Muscat and Dhahran to meet requirements of this reduced operation. 63. Rations and Medical Supplies. These should be supplied for approximately the following: * West Coast. East Coast. Locust Officers 6 Medical Officer 1 Transport Officers 1 MESC Liaison Officer 1 B.NCO 1 s and O.Rs.

I have spoken to (a) Mr. Eutchings, who informs me that the State Garage could remetal the three big-end bearings if they were given the necessary metal by Bapco. (b) the R.A.F., who tell me that- they can supply neither bearings nor metals for remetalling. (c) Mr. De Jong of the Bapco garage, who tells me that the big-end bearings may be either (i) 'Loose liners' or (ii) cast bearings, depending on the particular model of the Ford, ^‘he Company have no new bearings. If the truck’s bearings are 'loose liners' they have a few / second hand ones, which they might be able to let us have if we sent an official application to the C.L.R. If they are cast bearings, they might be able either to remetal them themselves or, at least, to supply the Government Garage with the necessafy metal for the purpose. They are short of this metal, but bethinks that they could spare the small amount that wejfrequire. Pending the reply to my telegram to Mr. Fitzgerald, the Government G&amp;ragje will not ^dismantle the truck Office please resubmit these papers, with anon the first portion of my foot-note to Mr. Fitzgeralds letter of August 11th.
