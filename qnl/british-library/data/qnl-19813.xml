The Hesidenoy Agent ,3har^aJi. Captain A.A.'Russell. Secretary to the Pollyioal Resident in the P.a., 'Rush ire . After Oomplinents. I have the honour to inform you that on the 13ta August {July) 1930,1 received a letter from Shaikh Hashid bin {uma-i-d, Ruler oi A J man tnrough the hand of a man named Mayed bin Sultan,one of his subjects who hai left De'oai for the pearl? 'banks to huy pearls from divers / saying that in oonseq.uence of a strong south-westerly wind the 'bow of his 'boat 'broke and she drifted to the Frur Island: that the Mudir of Customs there plundered his money and charged a Tufangchi to take him to \ Lingah to the Senior Mudir there: that Hayed arrested the ?unfa j-Ufdn^Ciii and took him to Ajman. I 'beg to submit herewith the Shaikh's letter in original: the statement of Myyed 'bin Sultan an. the statement of the Nakhuda of the sailing 'boat for your information. On the 5th \ugust however H»M«3,the 7ycalraen urriv-i. at liargah and I / having 'boarded the ship / interviewed the ^aptain and ini ormed him of what had happened from the beginning | to the end. The CJaptain sent a telegram to the Hon^le the Polit Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and received a reply to the effect that he and I should proceed to Ajman and to take the Tufangchi on 'board the man of war. le therefore went to Ajman .1 landed there and having seen the Shaikh with much difficulties and after having given him assurances that all the things which had 'been plundered from Mayed 'bin Sultan would 'be restored,! succeeded to ootain the Tufangchi and took him on 'board the man- of-war and handed him over to the CJaptain and she left Shargah for 'Bahrain in order that he should call at the pearling 'banks to look after the pearling 'boats there as it was rumoured that the JTudir at Lingah would send a launch to the pearling 'banks toarrest some 'boats of Ras-ul-Khainiaii and tov/ thera down to Lingah. The Ruler of Ajman protests saying that the British OoTemawnt have^y treaty / undertaken to guard the seas and no- one should 'be ahle to venture any Vvwii/on them •For this reasons / he says,the Eulers of the Trucial ^Joast do not allov/ tiieir subjects to carry arms with themselves on the high seas in order that no disturbances should come off and then/become responsible to tne British G-ovemment.But if the Persians would transgress upon their subjects on high seas and if when they have been drifted to a port by winds they are plundered by the Persians then the Rulers would permit their subjects to carry arms with themselves for their protection. The Ruler of Ajman and his subjects intended going to | the 'Prur Island to arrest the Mudir of Customs there but I | prevented them from doing so^ I trust that an arrangement would be effect^whereby the Arabs of the Trucial Coast would ^ not suffer any loss ancyihereby be compelled to create disturbances on high seas. U.S., Translation of letter dated 7th Rabi* ul Awal 1348-?th August 1930 from Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid,Ruler of Ajman,to the Residency Agent,3hargah. A • CJ. , The bearer hereof T.Tayed bin Sultam one of my subjects will call upon you and inform you of what has been done to him 1 by Persians at the Frur Island.They have plundered his money and then charged a man to. take him to the Senior Hudir 4 at Lingah to imprison him there. I am really very much surpria ed at the doings of the Persians on the high seas. 7e considei that the high seas are being under the safety of the British Government and that no-one can therefore transgress upon any-body and for this reason I always prevent my subjects (divers or pearl merchants) norto carry any arms in their boatwlien Vaey proceed to t:ie pearling 'banks so tUat no disturbances hU^ siiouid take/on hltfi seas-. But should th.e Persians do sucli evil deeds tiien I shall 'be compelled to permit my subjects to carry arms with themselves on board their boats.Mayed bin Sultan to AJman has brought/the Persian who was to take him to Lingah in order to escape imprisonment and insults. This Persian is now with me and I shall not release him until the two thousand Rupees and pearls which have been taken from Mayed are returned I have also heard that one of my subjects named Ahdur one Hahman bin Ahmad with another person who is/of your subjects namely Yusuf bin Abdullah bin Lutah have been arrested at the Q.ais Island . My object it is that you may please let me know whether my subjects could be released and their properties restored or not/oecause I am in a position to retaliate for these on Persian subjects. ^ U.S., Statement of Mayed bin Sultan dated 7th Babi^ul Awal 1349- 2nd August 1930* I left AJman in my own boat on the 2nd Rab'ul Awal 1349 (2^th July 1930) #31? the pearling banks in or ler to butj pearls there.

This happened at ahout sunset and after an hour had passed from the^lght, w«r left the Frur Island.The Tufangchi slept,we took his arm and we all combined and havlng[ arrested him/tied him up.

I airr directed to inform you that the Captain of the ••dyclamen' proceeded to Farur and there made enquiries regard- ins the confiscation of the Rupees found on hoard the tv/o '* i dhows from. A.jman. The Tftidir admitted that he had taken Hs.3080/- from one dhow and 'Rs•850/- from the other hut stated that he had handed over Us.1930/- to the tofangchi. This agrees with the statement made hy T'ayed 'bin Sultan. There is si therefore only a sum of Es.2000/- due to the owners of the two | dhows. The Mudir denies that he confiscated any pearls from these dhows. The Interpreter of the rt Cyclamen' went ashore at Farur and made private enquiries from the people of 7arur and though they all stated tnat the Mudir had taken the Rupees ; they none of them knev; anything ahout t ie pearls. I'o^over the Mudir informed the dap tain of the '* GJyclamen' that the first dhow v/as 'bound with cargo for Kais and the second dhow for Sheikh Shuaih and that they were not hound for the pearl hanks. This seems correct since it is very difficult to helieve that a dhow that was hound for the pearl hanks should have 'been 'blown so far north as Farur. I hope that the Rs.2000/- will he recovered very shortly hut further evidence is required regarding the pearls before a claim can he submitted to the Persian Government for their value. Please therefore direct the Nakhudas to produce any further evidence they may have regarding the pearls before you and send it to me for the information of the TIon*hle the Political Resident. From the fact that the owners of the dhows stated that they were going to the pearl hanks whereasin faot they were prooeedin^ to Kais ^nd 3huai'b and the ^act that none of the inhabitants of Farur knew anything ahout the pearls, Colonel Biscoe thinks it is very improhahle that any pea,rls y^ere oonfisoated 'by the Customs and is not prepare to submit this claim to the Persian authorities unless there is strong evidence in support of it. The Nakhudas should he asked to show where they got the pearls from and what was their value and number. Please inform the Shaikh of Ajman that prompt steps are 'being taken to recover the 'balance of the money and that on n( account should he or his subjects take any action.

Two AJMAN dhows belonging to merchants wished to land cargoes of food in Persian Islands and had to call at FARUR first for examination according to Persian rules* Fl^t D Iiow. First dhow (owner. Hashed son of Khalifa) left'TuM/uT with women passengers and a cargocof rice and coffee with an-invoice from DABAI to KAIS. It arrived at FARUR on 31st July. 4. The Customs Director made the people land, searched the dhow and confiscated 850 Rupees in cash. He gave the owner a pass to KAIS and a letter addressed to the Customs Director, KAIS. The letter contained instructions to allow the passengers and cargo to be landed but he-was to detain the dhow until he had reported the matter to LINGEH to ascertain whether his action was correct. 5. The dhow sailed for KAIS the same day,31st July. S-SeGond dim, The second dhow (owner Mayed son of Sultan) left. AJHAN with a cargo of 10 bags of rice and 4 bags of coffee with an invoice from DABAI to SHEIKH SHUAIB and arrived with a damaged yard at FARUR on 1st August.

He was received by a demonstration of the populace and a blunt refusal. They said 'for many many years there has been no 'fighting at sea and the English Government produced this 'state and earned our confiaence. During the last two 'years the Persian Government have played hell, suoiled 'our merchandise and treated us in a high handed manner. We 'find the British Government does not look after our welfare 'as they used to and as promised by the treaty. The Persians 'tell us the British Government is no more good in Gulf 'for they do things and are not punished for them'. 13.

The main correspondents include: the Political Resident Persian Gulf, Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf; Minister for Foreign Affairs of Persian Government.The file includes reports on two dhows that left Ajman on the Trucial Coast with food for pearl banks. They were stopped by the Persian Customs Director at Farur who confiscated rupees and pearls; it ordered the second dhow to proceed to Lingah with police on board. The dhow returned to Ajman and the Shaikh imprisoned the police; only the presence of a British ship prevented Ajman from sending an armed force. The Political Resident Persian Gulf noted that it was 'undesirable that Persian officials should correspond with Trucial Shaikhs'. Following discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Persian Government the matter was resolved and arrangements made for the Persian Custom Authorities at Bushire for transfer of the confiscated rupees. The file includes the Shaikh of Ajman's original letter in Arabic to the Residency Agent, Sharjah and English translation.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ajman, Āl Nu'aymī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000100#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
