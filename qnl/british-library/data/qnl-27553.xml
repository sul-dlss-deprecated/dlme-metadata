After compliments, * ^ i&gt;alams from the starnger. I sent you two letters and do not them know whether you hasae received/or not as no reply has been received from you . One of my letters was sent on the 1st January 1940, and the other after the death of the deceased. God*s pitty may be on him. Today I have come to know from Shaikh Ahmad that correspondence between you and he continues. What was then the reason of this silent It might be either that the letters are lost or because you are still feeling the sorrows which affected us as well. I think this is what prevented you from replying. I have nothing else to say but tc express repeated sorrow and disappointment- for the death of that noble and gallant man whose rememberance will remain unforgotten in the history of the west and Islam. My condolence to you all on account of the calamaties and troubles you met. Please let me know if you think that I can be of any help to you and I will do my best.
