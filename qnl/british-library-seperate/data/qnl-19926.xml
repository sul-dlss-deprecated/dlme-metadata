Samuel Hennell informs Sheil that the very large deficiency in the annual revenue payable by the Governor of Bushire for the last two years is the ostensible cause of Sheik Nasir's dismissal. Hennell states that he does not think that the dismissal is in any degree connected with the friendship that existed between Hennell and Sheik Nasir. However, Hennell writes that it is his impression that His Excellency the Prime Minister [M카rz훮 Taq카 Kh훮n, known as Amir Kabir] may have considered that, in light of the intimacy that has for several generations existed between the English and the Sheik's family, it would be in the interests of the Persian Government if its principal sea port were under the control of persons who have no connection to the English.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00004f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
