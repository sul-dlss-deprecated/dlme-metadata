Characteristic features of Iznik wares include a hard, white body, crystal-clear glaze, a wide range of brilliant colors, and an elegant painting style.\r\n\r\nOttoman ceramic artists took much of their inspiration from nature and created designs incorporating both recognizable plants, flowers, and trees and stylized leaves. Chinese blue-and-white porcelains also served as models, as on this plate decorated with delicate spirals in the \"Golden Horn\" type.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase, 1966", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14711", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Walters Art Museum, 1966, by purchase. \r\n", "Dynasty": "Ottoman Dynasty", "Reign": "Suleyman the Magnificent (AD 1520-1566)", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.19", "Creator": "Turkish", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.2281_3QtrTop_DD_AST18-027632-tms.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.2281_3QtrTop_DD_AST18-027632-tms.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.2281_3QtrTop_DD_AST18-027632-tms.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.2281_3QtrTop_DD_AST18-027632-tms.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_48.2281_3QtrTop_DD_AST18-027632-tms.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1501462", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL9_48.2281_Fnt_BW_H66.jpg, PS1_48.2281_3QtrTop_DD_AST18-027632-tms.jpg, PS1_48.2281_Bot_DD_AST18-013697-tms.jpg, PS1_48.2281_Side_DD_AST18-027634-tms.jpg, PS1_48.2281_Top_DD_AST18-013695-tms.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
