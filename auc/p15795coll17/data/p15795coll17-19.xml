Badeau was the American University at (in) Cairo’s second President, in office from 1945 to 1953, previously having served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1938 to 1945 and a member of the faculty from 1936. A portrait of AUC ‘s founder and first President Charles R. Watson is provided, with anecdotes revealing of his personality. He speaks of Watson’s approach to religion at the university, fundraising (including cultivating visitors to Cairo), and financial management. He tells a story about the origins of the Journalism program at AUC, as an initiative by Watson to shape Egyptian journalism after a newspaper story falsely accused the university of using prostitutes to attract students to enroll. He also offers sketches of Deans John McClenahan (his Arabic skills and gregarious nature in contrast with Watson), Worth Howard (his sociability), and Russell Galt (his eagerness for rapid change at AUC). Badeau discusses AUC’s prospective move to a suburban campus in Giza near the pyramids, including motivations like concerns about civil disturbances at the Cairo central-city location and its limited potential for expansion, and his role in securing the architect and generating the campus design. Drawbacks to the suburban campus idea were its operational costs and the challenge of transportation there, and he tells of the influence of Trustee George Jewett in calling for the campus to remain at the downtown location. In covering his own presidency, Badeau addresses his declining offers of United States government financial support to AUC in order to ensure independence in the university’s operations. There is no audio for this interview, and the transcript is not verbatim, but rather notes by interviewer Lawrence Murphy.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
