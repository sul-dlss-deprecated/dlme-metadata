The British Government was keen to enforce Article 3 of the Political Agreement dated 5 March 1934 between HM Government and the Company, which stated that the employees of the Company should at all times, so far as was consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking, be British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The employment of other nationalities therefore required approval from the British authorities. The papers show that the British were particularly keen to avoid the presence in Kuwait of a large number of American personnel.The papers include quarterly lists of Kuwait Oil Company staff for the period 1935-47 at grades A, B, and C, giving name, designation, nationality, and date of commencement of service; minutes of meetings at the India Office; and correspondence between the company and British officials concerning the employment of individuals (e.g. for geological survey work).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Nationality</topic></subject><subject><topic>Personnel</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000187#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000187#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
