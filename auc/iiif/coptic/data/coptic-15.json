Iryan Moftah was a Coptic langauge specialist (1626 - 1886).  He was appointed to teach Coptic in the newly established College founded by the father of Coptic reform, Cyril IV (1854 - 1860), who aimed at modernizing the Coptic Orthodox Church.  Moftah is known to have written manuals and grammar books for teaching the Coptic langauge in the reformed modern style.  This probably occurred under the influence of the ecumenical spirit of his superior, Cyril IV, who aimed at bringing the Greek and Coptic churches closer.", "subject-lcsh": "Bohairic dialect; Coptic church; Coptic language; Grammar; Teaching", "date-created": "19th century", "type": "Still Image", "format": "image/jp2", "extent": "154 p.; 19.5 x 13 cm.", "medium": "manuscripts (document genre)", "language": "Coptic", "identifier": "SC-2003-01-01-13-6", "collection": "Iryan Moftah Coptic Language and Religion Manuscripts", "source": "<span>From: <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.aucegypt.edu/digital/collection/p15795coll4/id/3175\">Coptic language grammar</a></span>", "license": "Copyright 2013, American University in Cairo.
