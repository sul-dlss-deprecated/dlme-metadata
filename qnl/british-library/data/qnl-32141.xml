Dear Sumner, Your letter to G-rist of January 25th, reference I.IO 5 , HI, 154£.LI*C.0.F.a.Repts., about the proposed gift of some captured Italian guns and ammunition to the Sheikhs of Qatar, Dibai and Sharjah. 2. These three Sheikhdoms are all British Protected States, /ma- impn held to have automatically become ttmc •&gt; belligerent when H.M.G. declared war. -sts/'-aaaa therefore generally re sponsible^ for their protection, and defence schemes for them were worked out before the war under the direction of the A.O.C. Iraq. In the case of Qatar, I4»fer0. lo under ^specific obligations, since has guaranteed the protection of the Sheikhdom from attack by sea and the protection of the Sheikh against 'serious and unprovoked attacks on his territory from outside his frontier 1 '. 3. There are, in addition, the political considerations adduced/adduced by the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, as reported in paragraph 3 'tbe telegram from Coimnander-in— Chief, Middle East, enclosed with your letter. With regard to these I need only say that the operations of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. at Qatar have had to be suspended on the orders of H.M.G. for reasons connected with the war effort. This has naturally cajisgd, tjie Sfreikh som^§atisfaction, which it is desired to allay as far as possible. 4. In all the circumstances we fully support the Political Residents recommendation, and feel that it would be , entirely inappropriate to charge the Sheiiis anything for these arms and ammunition. „ t . 5.

Any course should in the first instance be based on making the Shaikh*s local forces as efficient as -ossiole so tnat they can, with their own resources, defeat any raias otner than a general invasion fro ji 3AUCI ARABIA. inis is all one more necessary now since, as stated above, it&gt; is noiDt/ful i-^ any aircraft could oo scared to co-operate with tne Chaika* s -.01 cos id iq were en^a^ed in an Empire emergency. Further the nore efficient the Chaikn* s local forces are, the less will the neighbouring tribes oe tempted to raid into QATAR. 15 . The local forces can be increased in efficiency by equipping them with modern rifles and mobile light automatics and by instruction in weapon training and tactical principles. 16 . Any tactical plan can only be made out when it is known whether or not the oilfields will develop and when the route of any proposed oil pipe line is decided. In this tvpe of country the imcortance of any large group of water wells such as the EAIT^A well s should be bor»ne in mind and any plan should take into consid eration the possibility of seizing the various water areas or denying their use to the enemy by repeated air attacks. 17 .

Reference Air Officer CoasmandIng* a secret letter Bo* 10647 / 4 /a ir.C., dated the 6th February 1939, forwarding an appreciation in respect of the defence of catar. 2. iince admittedly this appreciation la designed for temporary purpoeea pending fuller information of the possi bilities of oil development in ;atar I need not maae any leng thy cogent* I have the following remarks in regard to detallat It gives a somewhat incorrect impression to say that the peninsula is practically uninhabited in the interior, since at most times there are large numbers of nomads. It would be more correct to sayi 'There are practically no permanent habitations in the interior, but at certain periods of the year there «*r* nomads in considerable numbers*. fTMamah.j The name of the €11 Company is 'Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited* and its camp is roughly two miles inland from the western coast. 'Hummocks* would be more correct tlian 'Hills'. kM^...amapSLft It would be more correct to say* 'There is difficult hilly country/-country (though not high hills) immediately north and north-east of the Oil Camp and test well. Paragraph 8« I do not quite understand wiry Dohah should be named as an important tactical point. It is not actualxy the Shaikh’s capital, it is a very bad port, and its only importance seems to be that it is tie largest •♦town* in &gt;tar. ^he aerodrome to the north of the town is not, to my mind, well located strategically* Paragraph 12, As stated above I think the Dohah landing ground is badly placed. It is bo miles by road from the Oil lamp which, assuming oil developments, will pres jmably be the main point of delence. I have personally seen an area about 2 miles from the Zekrit landing, on the road from Zekrit pier to the Oil Camp, which could be cleared and used as an aerodrome very cheaply. The Royal Air ?orce will presumably wish to verify this view and the : Air liaison Officer might take an early opportunity of visiting Zekrit. In so far as expenditure is concerned, I think the Oil Company will be prepared to meet the cost of clearance provided it is allowed to use its own aircraft in normal times. Paragraph 16 /1 * 4 i'rt '■aragrasi: M The recar^endstion to secure the ;;«ilwa IVella presumably depends on the existence of a state of war with }audl Arabia or of anarchy in Saudi Arabia* In other circumstances I do not see hoe forces operating in conjunction with the Koyel Air Force can enter Saudi territory to seise the alia* To my mind the importance of these fella is over estimated, and I am inclined to believe that even BddU forces would not be entirely dependent on them* nevertheless I admit that 3alwa would be a useful gathering point for such forces* I am strongly in favour of encouraging the Shaikh of jjtar to buy four, if not six. Bran or lewis guns, and mount them on Ford V-8 rt pick-upa w * He himself is very anxious to have armoured cars, but it should not be difficult to convince him that these will be useleas in Qatar, and he will certainly be eager to purchase the next beet thing, •■araarapk The Shaikh is purchasing 2,25,000 rounds of ammunition, ■/-arokrapb £3 I strongly support the recocarendation made here for Boyal Air Force exercises in co-operation with the Shaikh's forces. Apart from their training value they should heve considerable political effect. d/- H, ^eightman Political Agent, Bahrain,a ^ a r a T )*0.N0.C/513 3at«d the 8th August 1938. $il\ you plsaos rsfsr to Sir TrenoharU /owls's 1938 and tlxs papers forwarded therewith in regard to trie Defence of the Culf ? In thle letter I ehall deal with the question of ^atar» 2 # ‘jjae position to |at&amp;r is tnat His ttajesty’s acvernaent guarantee tne protection of .atar from attacK: oy sea and n&amp;re also undertaicen the protection 01 the ;hiai*fc of Ctatar against w 8eriouc and unprovoked attacks on his territory from outside his frontier’** The Shaikh has been informed that His Majesty^ Government propose to carry out this latter object by means of the Royal Air Force» and it hae also been made clear to tne Shaikh that he is erpeoted to take all reasonable steps for hxs own defence and for maintaining order within his own irontier* The danger of attack by sea or air has been ruled out of consideration* and hitherto* in tne absence ox British interests in 4 atar* the matter has been one only of general aid in defence against serious Bedu attack. How* however* the problem is complicated oy tne operations of a predominantly iritisn oil company* namely Petroleum development (qat&amp;r) Limited* and in tne near future it Air Vice Marshal C.2*.Courtney* CB.* CBS** B30** Air officer Comnanding British Forces in Iraq* Habbmiya*may become necesoary to provide for tne protection of an oil field and a pipe line not only against Bedu attack (the prospective oil field is uncomfortably near tne presumptive frontier) but also against sabotage* The position is tn&amp;t the Company intend to begin drilling in the autumn, and it is conceivable that with good fortune they may stride oil in important quantities in the coming winter* Though this envisages wn&amp;t is, from tne point of view of defence, still a purely hypotnetical liability (and obviously any sonants of protection must await develop ments), it may be as well at tnia stage to mention certain problem features bearing on the possible pstxgtm&amp;ai in H atar* (*) --r-e *axue oo-oueratiuo ay ta g JHaUa of Qatar in any Atfanaiv* aqneat. At the present moment the Shaikh can raise a considerably ^edu force armed with sosewnat antiquated Rifles of doubtful offensive value, and ne has recently, as I nave informed you separately, placed an order with the 3*0.A. Company for 450 *303 Magazine rifles and 225000 rounds of ammunition. The delivery of these rifles, however, will not be completed in muon under a year* The shaikh has also made enquiries about tne possibility of obtaining armoured oars, and though tne nature of the terrain is sucn as to render neavy armoured care useless, it is not unlikely that in due \ course the 5haii;h may be able to put into tne def ence pool two or three light lorries mounted with machine ( guns after the Kuwait pattern* ,Ah important point to note here is taitTshaikh*s fear of and antipathy towards the ;aud i Government, which should serve to ensure a reasonable standard of co-operation by him in any defensive measures which may become3 r'* become neoesaary. (b) Petroleum Development ('atar) Limited own and operate a short range ?'/? set enlon, at any rate until all prospect at oil is abandoned and % ipeo facto, tne defence problem in ^atar it eiaplifled, will be available for use for defence purposes* Tnis //? set naa hitnerto oeen in Doiiab but Is n ow to be removed to tne Oil Company *s Camp on the otner side of the peninsula in the Jebel xiKhan* (c) The Royal Air Force aerodrome near Donah is roughly ob miles from the Oil Company^ Camp, which in the event of successful development would presumably be the main defensive point* (d) If oil is found in the Jebel Duhh&amp;n area it must be piped to the northern point of the jfctar peninsula for export, since there is insufficient water on the western side of tno peninsula for tankers. (e) There is no Political officer in ^atar and no Satire Agent as at Sharjah* Whether or not such an officer will be appointed for administrative purposes must of course depend on tne develppment of tne hoped-for oil field* /part therefore from the general question of frontier protection to implement the undertaking &amp; iven to the Shaikh by His Hajesty’s Government, tne situation in ;atar ie leeo definite than eloewneret and it may be desirable to undertake more detailed examination of a scheme for ^atar after schemes for other areas have been prepared. ?or it is at least possible tnat the OilOil ^oapany’s winter operations may atrve to present a clearer picture of tne ultimate pro Diem* **• I am sendIng copies of tma letter to tile India Office, Government of 2ndia 9 Senior saval &lt;Jfficer, and tile Political Agent, lanrain.
