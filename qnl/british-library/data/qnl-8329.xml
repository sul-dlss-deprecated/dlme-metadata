M.PORT WILLIAM,♦&gt; Enclosure No. 3. No. 31P V dated Poonaj 17th September 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to report, for the information of the Government of India, the proceedings of His Highness the Gaekwar consequent on the receipt of His Excellency the Viceroy's khureeta forwarded with your letter No. 1586P. of 25th July last. 2. No protest or other answer has been received from the Gaekwar, and it does not appear that any is contemplated by him. 3. In accordance with the advice which the Resident was directed to tender, the Gaekwar caused the officials mentioned in paragraph 11 of your letter to resign their offices, but he expressed the wish to break the fall of one of them, his brother-in-law Nana Saheb Khanwelkur, to whom he has always shown much attachment, by conferring on him the purely honorary title of Prutineedhee without entrusting to him any administrative functions. It appeared to this Government that such an arrangement if really carried out would not be contrary to the spirit of the advice which the Government of India directed to be given, and the Resident was directed to intimate this view to the Gaekwar, at the same time informing him that the honorary title in question would not entitle Nana Saheb to receive any greater honors than those to which he may be entitled as Sir Soobah of the Contingent. 4. After much consideration the Gaekwar decided to appoint Mr. Dada- bhoy Nowrojee as Dewan. The Resident whom the Gaekwar previously consulted entertained so unfavourable an opinion of Mr. Dadabhoy's qualifi cations that the Government thought it necessary to direct the Gaekwar to be informed that no objection would be offered to Mr. Dadabhoy's appointment if His Highness in the exercise of his independent discretion should think proper to appoint him, and that he would receive every assistance from the Resident. Without such an assurance there was reason to apprehend that the Minister's influence would be impaired, and that the Gaekwar might have some reason to complain that he had not been allowed a fair chance of reforming his adminis tration with the assistance of a Minister of -his own choice. 5. The Gaekwar has since applied to this Government for the services of certain British officials of standing and experience. Consent has been given to the transfer of these gentlemen if they should be willing to serve His High ness which he is now ascertaining. Their names will be reported to the Government of India when the arrangements are concluded. Enclosure No. 4. No. 28P., dated Poona, 6th September 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Secretary to the Government of India, Financial Department. Referring to the orders of the Government of India, contained in your letter No. 1586P. of 25th July last, in regard to the course to be now adopted towards His Highness the Gaekwar, I am directed to submit that as the Resident is required to give authoritative advice on such difficult subjects as the revision of the land revenue system in the Baroda State, and the settlement of inams and wuttuns, it seems essential that he should have the assistance of an officer of experience and tried ability, well versed in the tenures of Guzerat. To secure the services of such an officer it is necessary that the pay of the Assistant Resident should be raised from Rupees 750 to not less than Rupees 1 11,500 a month, and I am to solicit sanction to this expenditure as a purely temporary measure during the remainder oi 1874 and 1875.

His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, before givino- an opinion on the proposal, will await Colonel Phayre's reports of his proceedings subsequent to the receipt by His Highness the Gaekwar of the orders of 0 the Government»of India communicated to you in my letter No. 1586P., of the 25th of July last.

Translation of a yad from His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda, No. 1459, dated 17th August 1874. With reference to that part of the Governor-General's khureeta in which His Excellency informs me that if I require the assistance of officers of the British Government, His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council will, on my application, do all in his power to meet my wishes, 1 shall deem it a favor if His Excellency the Governor of Bombay will lend me for two years the services of the following officers to be employed on the duties specified :— 1. Shumbooprasad Luxmilal, Esquire (as Head Revenue Settlement Officer). 2. Pestonjee Jehanghir, Esquire (as Head Settlement Officer for inams, wuttuns, and alienated lands). 3. Shunker Pandoorung Pundit, Esquire (as Deputy to the Sir Sooba). 4. Pitamberdass Jetha, Esquire (Dufturdar to the Political Agent at Bhooj), as Dufturdar to the Sir Sooba. 5. Three experienced and intelligent Mamlutdars to serve in the Revenue Department. I leave it to His Excellency in Council to fix* the salaries of these officers for the period they will be employed in this State. Should I require more officers 1 shall address you as necessities arise. It is of the utmost importance that I should have as early as possible experienced, able, and honest men to assist me in carrying out the reforms the Government of India expect me to introduce. I therefore trust that His Excel lency the Governor of Bombay in Council will take this request into his earliest and favorable consideration. No. 1611, dated Baroda, 26th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar. On my arrival here last evening Rao Saheb Bapoobhai called at the Residency with yads, and I requested him to inform Your Highness, with my compliments, that with reference to Durbar yad No. 1459, dated 17th instant, applying for the services of certain officers of the British Government, I should be happy .to confer to-day, or whenever it might seem convenient to Your Highness, with your Minister, Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee, on the subject, because, aoreeably to the request contained in my yad No. 1480C.I., dated 10th instant, paragraph 3, the conditions of the employment of, and the powers to be vested in, the British officials named, &amp;c., are not specified, as it is necessary they should be for the information of Government. Please therefore arrange about this as soon as convenient. The military honors usually accorded to Your Highness' Minister by British guards will be paid to Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee, and orders have been issued to that ettect. Translation of yad from His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda, No. 1524, dated 20th August 1874.

It should be pointed out to the Durbar that these officers will be re quired, while employed at Baroda, to contribute a percentage on their pay according to the rule to entitle them to retain their right to pension and leave allowances from Government. 3. Government will permit any of these officers who may accept appoint ments at Baroda to retain a lien on their present offices for twelve months. No. 290-982, dated Baroda, 12th September 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. With reference to Government Resolution No. 5238, dated 7lh instant, I have the honor to acquaint you that having communicated the purport thereof in a yad to the Durbar, 1 have to-day received the accompanying reply. No. 1610 of this date, which is forwarded for the consideration ot Government. Translation of a yad from His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda, No. 1610, dated 12th Sep tember 1874. Residency yad No. 1691, dated 9th September 1874, with reference to certain officers of the British Government required for the service of this State is received. In accordance therewith communication has been opened with the officers. But I cannot help expressing my extreme regret that after having communi cated through the Resident my great anxiety on the subject, I have been so unexpectedly disappointed. The time allowed to introduce reforms is very short, and when every hour is important to me, I sincerely trust that the Bombay Government will reconsider their decision, and give me their cordial help by sending the officers I have asked for, as on special duty, without delay. I shall not object to any special arrangements as to salary and percen tage of pension which the Bombay Government may think proper in preference to the terms I have proposed in my yad No. 1524, dated 28th August 1874.r Enclosure No. 7.

Viceroy wishes Bombay Government to give active assistance to Gaekwar in supplying suitable men. Letter by to-morrow's post. Enclosure No. 8. No. 12.C.P., dated Viceroy's Camp, Hazareebagh, 20th October 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I am directed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to acknowledge your letter No. 5812, dated 8th October, received at Calcutta on the 15th and here on the 19th instant, relative to the application of the Gaekwar for the services of officers for employment in the Baroda State. 2. It is matter of regret to His Excellency the Governor-General in Council that, although His Highness the Gaekwar applied on the 17th of August (a little more than a fortnight after he received the decision of the Government of India upon the report of the Baroda Commission) for the assistance of officers in carrying out the reforms which the Governor-General in Council required him to introduce, no effective steps appear to have yet been taken by the Bombay Government to carry out the instructions conveyed 'Should therefore the G.ekwar a ,k ^ paragraph 7 of my letter No. 1586P., dated 25th the Bombay Govermnent July 1874, which 1 am directed to quote in the can approve.' margin. No action whatever appears to have been taken on the renewed appeal for help which the Gaekwar preferred on the 12th September, and which was submitted under cover of your letter of 8th October without opinion or remark. 3. The Governor-General in Council does not consider that the terms of the Resolution of the Bombay Government, No. 5238, dated 7th September, were calculated to invite the assent of the officers named to the offer of the Baroda Durbar, or that any communication was addressed to them expressing the wish of the Government of Bombay that they would accept the offer. As the Government of Bombay intimated that they would not object to the employment of the officers named, it is presumed that the arrangements as to the powers to be vested in them and the conditions of their employment (except in the unimportant matter of pension and leave allowances in respect to which the Gaekwar subsequently intimated his readiness to agree to any special arrangements that might be wished) were considered satisfactory. Under these circumstances, active assistance should have been given to the Gaekwar under the instructions of 25th July, and if the services of the men selected by His Highness could not be granted, the names of other men should have been suggested to him, and the officers selected should have been sent on special duty under orders of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council. To this effect I telegraphed yesterday under instructions of the Governor-General. 4. The Governor-General in Council cannot but regret the delay that he fears, from the information before him, has been allowed to take place in this matter; a delay which is not calculated to encourage the Baroda Durbar in introducing or persevering in those necessary reforms on which so many interests depend. The Governor-General in Council expects that the help of the BombayGovernment will be cordially and actively given to the Durbar whenever this can properly be done. If there be no properly qualified officers under the Bombay Government willing to assist in the reform of the Baroda Adminis tration, the Governor-General in Council will be prepared to depute officers serving under the Government of India. His Excellency in Council relies with confidence upon the cordial co-operation of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council in his efforts to place the Baroda Administration on a sound and satisfactory footing. Enclosure No. 9. No. 38P., dated Poona, 30th October 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed by His Excellency the Governor in Council to state that from your letter No. 12C.P. of the 20th October 1874 he has learned, with equal surprise and regret, that the course he has pursued in respect to providing the Gaekwar with the assistance of officers of this Government has caused dissatisfaction to His Excellency the Viceroy in Council, and is regarded by him as ' not calculated to encourage the Baroda Durbar in introducing or preserving in those necessary reforms on which so many interests depend.' 2. His Excellency in Council in no degree yields to the Government of India in a sincere desire to see those reforms judiciously carried out, and the retention by the Gaekwar of his hereditary position thereby secured. He is fully sensible also of the responsibility resting on this Government, as the authority entrusted with the immediate conduct of the affair for exerting itself to the utmost in promoting the success of the policy that has been adopted. And he believes it to be in his power to demonstrate beyond question that the task has been undertaken by this Government in a thoroughly loyal spirit, and that it has both in its own acts and in the instructions issued to the Kesident exhibited a decided disposition to assist the Gaekwar as far as the instructions it had received and a proper regard for the welfare and character of its own servants would permit. 3. His Excellency in Council, however, perceives that in one most import ant point this Government did not apprehend the full meaning of the instructions of the Government of India, in paragraph 7 of your letter No. 1586, of 25th July last, of which an explanation is now given in your letter under acknowledgment. It was not understood that by ' the request that endeavours be made to meet the wishes of the Gaekwar and to furnish him with the officers he may require,' the intention was that these officers should be ordered to take service under the Gaekwar irrespective of their own consent. It was supposed that the endeavours enjoined referred to the arrangements for the business of this Government by which the services of the required officers could be spared. When therefore the Gaekwar applied for certain officers the Government, disregarding its own convenience, at once accorded the neces sary permission, and guarranteed the officers a lien for one year on their own appointments. With this information before them, the Government of India state in your 2nd paragraph that no effective steps appear to have been taken to carry out their instructions. The Government of India must therefore have expected that this Government would order these officers to serve the Gaekwar and from your 3rd paragraph it is still more clearly to be gathered that the Government of India think the only question ought to have been whether the officers could be spared, and if so, they should have been sent on special duty under the orders of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council. 4. His Excellency in Council begs to submit that he is still unable to read the instructions of the Government of India as open to the above interpre- 67 tation, and it the less occurred to him as the course implied appeared, and still appears, open to grave objection. 5. On the 25th July last His Excellency the Viceroy wrote to the Gaekwar—' It has never been the wish of the British Government to interfere in the details of the Baroda administration, nor is it my desire to do so now. The immediate responsibility for the Government of the State rests, and must continue to rest, upon the Gaekwar for the time being. I must hold Your Highness responsible for the amendment of the serious evils disclosed, and I leave to you the selection of your agents.' 6. It is also necessary to keep clearly in view the true nature of the business in hand. It is an attempt at a vital reform of the administration of a State whose Ruler was described by the Commission in terms which it is not necessary for me to repeat. The Agents who had been principally employed by him were men of such character as to have induced His Excellency the Viceroy to press for their immediate dismissal. They were dismissed, but they are still at Baroda; they have constant access to the Gaekwar; and it is a matter of complete uncertainty whether they may not be able altogether to counteract better advisers. During the term assigned by the Government of India no interference can take place. We can advise, and we can register the rejection of advice; but the reckoning must be deferred until the close of the term of probation fixed by His Excellency the Viceroy in Council. The Native gentle men for whose services the Gaekwar has applied have already earned a high reputation, and have strong claims on their own Government. They know well the past history of Baroda, aud the influence with which they will have to contend in the honest discharge of their duty, if they accept service there. They might well have paused before accepting the office. They, must be sure that if at the close of the term of probation little or nothing has been effected in the shape of reform, efforts will be made to cast the blame on all within reach, themselves included, and they might well fear a loss of position in the eyes of their own Government. 7. It has not escaped His Excellency in Council that, apart from the question of actually ordering the officers applied for to serve the Gaekwar, the Government of India considers that a communication might have been addressed to them by Government which would have afforded them a strong inducement to take the proffered service. To this course the above objections apply in a minor degree, and it appeared to His Excellency in Council that it would be much more satisfactory if their services could be secured to His Highness without either orders or inducement on the part of Grovernment, and that neither should be resorted to in the first instance. Events have proved that the resort to neither was necessary. The Gaekwar has secured all the officers he desires except one mamlutdar, whom he wishes' the Government to nominate. One officer has already joined his new appointment, aud orders have been issued that the rest should join immediately. 8. His Excellency in Council at the same time regrets equally with the Government of India the delay which has occurred in the engagement of the officers on the principle on which he has acted, and he enters so strongly into the policy of the Government of India to avoid all possible ground of complaint on the Gaekwar's part of not having received the utmost assistance from Government in reforming his administration within the time allowed to him, that he would most strongly recommend that the time taken up in the engage ment of the required officers should not be counted within the prescribed time, and that the Government of India should, unsolicited by His Highness, extend this term from the 31st of December 1875 till the 31st March 1876. Enclosures No. 10. No. 6137, dated Bombay Castle, 22nd October 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2181P., dated the 6th instant, and, with reference to paragraph 2 thereof, to forward to you,for submission to the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a letter from the Resident at Baroda, No. 316-1100, dated the 7th instant, reporting on the proceedings of His Highness the Gaekwar in the Revenue Department. No. 316-1100, dated Baroda Residency, 7th October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government o£ Bombay. With my letter No. 258-852 of 1874, dated 12th August last, I had d -i i x t ^, on ^ ln A^A A f the honor to forward, for the information Residency yad, No. 1482C.2, dated 11th August r • e i . . i 1874, regarding ill-treatment and oppression of 01 CjOVemment, COpiCS Ol my yaClS tO the agricultural classes. Durbar as per margin, to which I received No. 1483C.3, dated nth of August, regarding the following replies under date the 17th moderate and equitable land settement, &amp;c., &amp;c. idem * '^V^ith respect to y^d No. 1842C.2, requesting that the barbarous processes employed in my State for realizing the revenue should be prohibited, and stating that the matter being one of inportance could not admit of delay, 1 beg to assure His Excellency that the matter has engagad my serious attention, the rules and mode of realizing the revenue and all such matters are at present under my consideration. A complete Revenue Code will be prepared as soon as possible, which will leave no room for committing oppression. Offenders in this respect will be duly punished. ' In Yad No. 1483C.3, you have brought to notice the subject of a moderate and equitable land settlement, and a faithful adherence to its terms in future—all, further executions of every sort or description being absolutely interdicted, and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part of Durbar officials being strictly forbidden. ' With regard to this I have to state that the last ten years' settlement has expired in most of the mehals, and it is necessary that for the current year some reasonable settlement of rates should be immediately made. Azum Kazee Shahboodeen made enquiries with regard to the jummabundee of the four northern mehals, viz., Bejapoor,Veesnuggur, Burnuggur, and Khyraloo, and have submitted a report, which not only suggests an immediate reduction of rates, but contains information which will be useful in making a settlement for a term of years. With regard to other mehals arrangements will be made as soon as possible. In the Nowsaree districts the Hoozoor Soobah has been making the necessary enquiries, with a view to make reasonable reductions in the rates of assessment. The advice of His Excellency as regards the rates of jummabundee will be carried out as soon as possible. The terms of settlement shall be adhered to, and no illegal increase made. No oppressive practices on the part of the Durbar officials will be permitted, and any official found guilty thereof shall be punished. 2. With regard to the continued levy of gadee nuzzerana, I had the 1. No.. 271922, dated sist August W74. honor to address the letters as per margin 2. „ 274-929 „ 2nd September 1874. to Government, and in accordance with 3. „ 279-945 „ 7th „ „ paragraph 1 of Government Resolution, No. 5376, dated 14th September, 1 addressed the following yad to the Durbar - 'No. 1731C.13, dated 16tli September 1874. ' From—Resident, Baroda, f&lt; To—His Highness the Gaekwar. ' Referring to the proceedings of the Baroda Commission marginally o - n . quoted, and to the khureeta of His Excel- &gt; ^ Br0 ' P ' ' r0d ' C0m,I ' 8 ■ loncy the Viceroy and Governor-General, 2. Appendix A. Grievances of the agricultural dated 25th July last, to Your Highness' address, I am desired by Government authoritatively to advise your Highness not to levy any accession nuzzerana where there is a fixed land assessment.'3. As I did not receive any reply to the above yad, and the complaints of the ryots continued, I spoke to the Minister Mr Dadabhoy on the subject, who told me that it was under discussion in the Durbar that it might have a very bad political effect were it admitted to the people that the gadee nuzze- rana would not positively be collected, and therefore that he had thought of entering it into the accounts as ' outstanding balance' (Baki). I replied that I had nothing to do with the internal arrangements he referred to, but merely with seeing that the advice tendered not to collect the tax was followed if accepted ; and that as the general outcry amongst the agriculturists was great, something should be done. 4. Einding by the 23rd September that no orders had been issued by the Durbar, and that pressure was being put on the ryots in connection with the tax, I on that date addressed the following yad. No. 1771, to the Durbar :— ' From—Resident, Baroda, 'To—His Highness the Gaekwar. For nearly a rtionth past written petitions have been received through the post from the Pergunnahs of Puttum, Wurnuggur, Kurree, Petlad, Bisnuggur, Khyraloo, &amp;c., complaining of the difficulties to which they are subjected by Mohsuls and other means to pay up the balance of the accession nuzzerana still due by them. 'In connection with this subject, I beg to invite Your Highness' attention to my yad No. 1731C.3. dated 16th instant. ' I mentioned to Your Highness' Minister a day or two ago that the Wasna Petels had complained to m&gt; of their having been deprived of their wuttuns, and common coolies of their village made patels in their place. The Hurnee people also have lately complained to me of the harsh treatment to which they are subjected in connection with their revenue dues. I invariably refer any petitioners who come to the Residency, or accost me on the public road to go and prefer their complaints to the Durbar, which they assure me they do. xt ,.00^.0 j . , ..... i . . 1a7 , 'In connection with these cases I No. li83C.3, dated 11th August 187, , . . ,. , „ 1484C.4 „ „ „ „ would invite attention to my yads as per „ itsoC.s „ » .. » margin.' 5. On the 24th September I had another conversation with Mr. Dadabhoy to much the same effect as in paragraph 3 above, when I told him distinctly that 1 could not recognize any such expedients as he had suggested, with a view, [ imagine, to maintain His Highness' sovereignty in the matter intact, and I added that if His Excellency the Viceroy's advice were accepted at all it must be in the same terms as tendered. 6. Accordingly on the 27th September I received the following yad from the Durbar, No. 1691, dated 27th September :— ' Residency Yad No. 1731C. 13 of 16th September 1874, about the non- levy of accession tax wherever there is a fixed assessment has been received. In reply we beg to state that the advice given will receive attention.' 7. Also a separate yad from the Durbar No. 1692 of 27th September in reply to part of my No. 1771 is as follows :— 'I have received the Residency No. 1771, dated 23rd September 1874 about the arrangement for the ryots of the districts of Kuddee, Puttun, &amp;c With regard to this I have to state that it is good that the people who come to you are referred to the Durbar; but some of the people do not appear here. The cases of those who come are properly enquired into. Dated 27th Septem ber 1874.' 8. Notwithstanding the fact that negotiations had been in progress from the 11th August and the 16th September respectively, upon the subjects set forth above, 'large numbers of agriculturists assembled at the Residency gates 9 ' 3on the ^norning of the 28th, and as I had repeatedly referred them to the Durbar where they declared they could not obtain any reply, I resolved to take down what they had to say and embodied it in the following yad to the Durbar No. 1798, dated 28th September 1874 ' From—Resident, Baroda, ' To—His Highness the Gaekwar. ' In my Yad No. 1731C.13, dated 16th instant, I communicated to Your Highness the authoritative advice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General ' not to levy any accession nuzzerana (in Your Highness' territory) where there is a fixed land assessment.' ' 2. On the 23rd idem I again addressed Your Highness, stating that com plaints hid been received by post from the Puttun, Wurnuggur, Kurree Petlad, Beesnuggur, and Khyraloo Pergunnahs, complaining ^of the heavy expense to which the ryots are put on account of mohsuls, in order to compel them to pay up the balance of the accession nuzzerana which they affirm they are utterly unable to do in addition to their heavy land assessment. ' 3. In your yads as per margin Your Highness consents to pay attention Nos. 1691 and 1692, dated 27th September 1864 ad\ ice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General upon this subject: and you request that any complainant who may come to me upon this or any other subject should be referred to the Durbar at once, and at the same time state that any such who do go their cases are enquired into, and redress given; but that some persons do not go at all. ' 4. Under these circumstances I think it right to bring to Your Hio -hness' notice the following instance which occurred to-day, as there would appear to be some misunderstanding upon this important subiect. u 5. When taking my walk this morning, I was accosted by four or five men who said they came from the Kurree Pergunnah, and I told them as usuAl to go to the Durbar, because 1 have been informed that orders to stop the collection of this nuzzerana had been issued ; they replied that they had been to the Durbar and had not obtained redress, in consequence of which 1 told them to come to me during Office hours at 11 o'clock to-day, when the leading man, named Keywul Purshotum, patel of the village of Panchote of the Kurree Pergunnah, stated as follows :— ' 6. That about eight or nine months ago foot mohsuls were posted at the vilJage in connection with the gadee nuzzerana tax for which they had to pay about Rupees 70, but that they were afterwards removed. That since the iVo^e. August 1874, khureeta delivered 3rd latter part of August last five SOWarS ^ . . and four footmen have been again posted as mohsuls at their village of 1 anchote, in order to make them pay up the balance of accession nuzzerana, amounting to Eupees 2,000; two thousand having been already pa-id in 1872 ; that the expenses of these sowars and tootmen fall very heavily upon the villagers being as follows :— ' Subsistence for each sowar per diem, viz : '10 seers of grain for horse ' 2 seers of flour for Sowar ' i seer of g-hee for Sowar ' Grass for horse ' Mohsulee paid in cash to Sowar 0 8 0 0 10 0 Total for each Sowar per diem Total for five Sowars per diem ... 5 10 0 12 0 ; Cliarge of five Sowars for one month ... ... 168 12 0 1011 ' Foot Mohsuls as follows :— ' Subsistence— ' 2 seers of flour ' seer of g-hee Mohsulee paid to eacli footrnan in casli ' Total for each footman per diem ' Total for four footmen per day ' Charge of four footmen per month 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 30 0 0 ' ^rand total of both horse and foot mohsulees per one month 198 12 0 ' 7. Thus independently of the accession tax this village alone is alleged to have been subjected to the above charges or thereabouts. '* 8. The patel of the village of Panchote continued to state that these mohsuls dunned them incessantly for payment; and that about eight days ago some peons came from the Mysana Thanadar to call him (the patel), and about 44 other villagers to Mysana about the payment of the arrears of acces sion nuzzerana. ihe Thanadar is said to have told them that they must pay the arrears due, otherwise they would be placed in the cage with Dhers; they replied that they had not committed any offence, and that they were utterly unable to pay the nuzzerana. The patel states that the Thanadar then ordered them to give bail for their appearance before the Wahiwutdar of Kurree, which they did, and reached Kurree on Wednesday, the 23rd instant. The Wahiwutdar being absent, they allege that they were detained until Friday, the 25th instant, when the Wahiwutdar told them to pay up the money; when they replied that they were utterly unable to do so; and state that they reminded the Wahiwutdar of the fact that about a m nth ago their crops had been damaged by the overflow of the river owing to excessive rain, and that at the time the Wahiwutdar, on being requested to come and see the damage done, did not do so. They sta^e that the Wahiwutdar again urged them to pay the gadee nuzzerana, else it would be their fate to go to prison, and accordingly the sepoys began to seize the villagers, but owing to the darkness they all escaped except about 11 men who were thrown into prison, and were still there when the Patel Kevul Purshotum left Kurree for Baroda three days ago. ' 9. The patel continued to state that he and two others of his villagers, named Munor Bhawa and Jeykurun Amichund, arrived at Baroda by the mail • train yesterday at nine o'clock ; that they immediately waited upon Kazee Shaboodeen, the Revenue Commissioner, and obtained an interview about 4 p.m ; that the Kazee Saheb informed them that they would have to pay the arrears Note—Compare with paragraph 3 above. of the accession nuzzerana, and that if (Sd.) r. p . they agreed to this, he would think of allowing them a reasonable time for payment. 'MO. Under these circumstances the petitioners accosted me on the road this morning, and should their general allegations be correct as above set forth, 1 have thought it proper to address Your Highness in order that immediate steps may be taken to give substantial effect to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's advice throughout Your Highness' territory as set forth in my yads above quoted, dated respectively the 16th and 23rd instant.' 9. Again, on the 1st October another large assembly of ryots took place at the Residency, and on this occasion I confronted them all with Mr. Dadabhai when he paid me his usual visit on that morning. I at the same time handed to him the following memorandum showing roughly who the petitioners were, and what were their claims. Mr. Dadabhai took the memorandum home with him, and ordered all the ryots to attend at his cutcherry that day.The memorandum is as follows :— ' 1. Village of Sakurda, Baroda Pergunnah, seven koss from Baroda on the Mahee. Dadabhai Guneslijee and 50 others complain that permission to mip crops is refused by the Mehta and Koomash, Cutcherry people. They demand tico sowcars as securities for arrears and current years revenue. These ryots plead that they are ready to pay security as usual, one for another. ' 2. Sokda, Baroda Pergunnah, five koss from Baroda. 'Bapoo Kachadass and others complained the same as No. 1 above. 'About 70 people of Sakda hold alienated land in the Doomala village of Manjoosar in possession of Ghorpaday. Permission to reap crops is refused on the same ground as above, viz., that the security of sowcars is required. Request permission to reap crops giving the usual security (one for another), the salamee tax has also been greatly increased by short measurements. u 3. Hurnee village, Khanjee Mahal, Tooljee Jewan and four others. 'Same complaint as No. 1 Sakurda.' ' 4. Petlaud Pergunnah, Dadran village, Hathibhai Kishorbhai. ' Khunjut Tricumbhai Dyabhai. ' Julsun Lulloo Vurujbhai and three others. ' Mogree Gopal Gullabhai and two others. 'Same complaint as Sakurda No. 1 above. u These ryots add that Mogree Havildar has obtained his appointment of payment of nuzzerana, also that such is the case with the village of Badran.' 'The whole of the above ryots complain that their crops are beini^ I repeatedly asked them about this, and I have damaged, and that 1 ohhd 6 stetll them no doubt about their having gone there as stated. Owim* to the delaV Caused bv the Durbar /grl \ i? p . * • v ^ • refusing to allow the crops to be reaped. They have never yet given sowcars security, and are quite unable to obtain such, but they are willing to give security as usual, viz., one cultivator standing security for another. They state that they went to the Durbar, but failed in obtaining redress.' 10. I understood verbally from Mr. Dadabhai that the persons described in this memorandum have received permission to cut their crops, and 1 conclude that the obnoxious innovation of requiring sowcars security, and thereby throw ing them hopelessly into the power of that class, has been avoided by the representation made. 11. 1 received the following reply from the Durbar to my yad No. 1798, vide paragraph 8 above :— No. 1727, dated 2nd October 1874. ' I have received the Residency yad No. 1798, dated 28th September 1874, having reference to the representations made by you regarding the mohsuls, &amp;c., placed by the Wahiwutdar of Kurree on certain ryots to recover the balance of the gadee nuzzerana. With regard to this I have to state that Eleven days'interval, orders could have reached fi rst from you about the gadee Kurree in two or three at most. i nuzzerana was dated 16th September (sa.) k . p. 1874^ j^ 0&gt; 1731. In reply to this I have sent yad ho. 1G91, dated 27th September 1874, to the effect that attention would be paid to the advice of the Government. This has been carried out. 'If the representations made to you by the people of Kurree about the His Excellency the Viceroy's khureeta was deli- imposition of mohsuls, &amp;C., is COlTOCt, vered on 3rd August 1874. ^ ^ } iave reference to a time before the above arrangements were carried out. 'In paragraph 9 of the yad mention is made of the, Sir Soobah's reply. With regard to this, it appears on enquiry of the Sir Soobah that the repres nt- ations made to you are not correct.' 1212. I have not sent any reply to this yad, because time will show whether substantial effect is really being given to the advice of Government or not. 13. On the 5th October Mr. Dadabhai came specially to the Residency Evidence regarding the actual state of affaire in after hia usual visit to ask me to give Petiami. a perwannah for troops to proceed to (sa.) r . p. Petlaud as disturbances had broken out there; and I understood him to say that they had been commenced by some Kolis from the Borsud Talooka, Kaira Collectorate. I therefore wrote the fol- lowingr letter to the Collector :— o ' No. 1074, dated Baroda, 5th October 1874. ' From—Resident, Baroda, ' To—Collector of Kaira. ' His Highness'Minister has just informed me that the Kolis of the Petlaud villages of Kussur, Juda, Mangrol, Mangulpur, Balanta and Cunploee are cutting the crops of some of the Koonbees in their neighbourhood, and he also implied that a kind of retaliation was going on between the above Kolis and British villages of the Muthur and the Borsud Talookas. ' 2. Mr. Dadabhai proposes to send 100 infantry and 25 sowars to Petlaud to keep the place, and I lose no time in informing you of the fact in order that you may take precautionary measures on your own frontier. These troops will leave Baroda to-night, as yet I have only received a verbal commu nication from Mr. Dadabhai, but when the formal yad comes, I will make you acquainted with its contents. ' 3. I did not clearly understand what concern we have in this matter, but I was led to conclude from what Mr. Dadabhai said that the Kolis of both districts were committing depredations'. 14. Next day (6th October) Mr. Dadabhai's communication of the pre vious day was embodied in the following yad. No. 1768, dated 6th October instant:— 'No. 1768, dated Baroda, 6th October 1874. ' From—Resident at Baroda, ' To—His Highness the Gaekwar. ' The Fouzdaree kamdar has sent in a yad.

In the same way the Gaekwaree ryots (Sd.) r. p. 0 £ p e tlaud Pergunnah who have gone over to the British villages of Balada, Detlee, Wusaee, Sidjiwada, Dewathuj, &amp;c., came over and removed the crops in our villages without permission. We request therefore that the Collector of Kaira may be addressed with a view to put a stop to these depredations in future, and a reply sent to us as early as possible.' 15. I at once replied in my No. 1887, dated 6th October, as follows ' In acknowledging the receipt of Durbar yad No. 1768 of this date, I have the honor to state that agreeably to the verbal request of Your High ness' Minister I yesterday wrote to the Collector of Kaira upon the subject of the disturbances that have again broken out in Petlaud ; and I also issued a pass for one company of infantry and 25 sowars to proceed there. ' 2. With reafard to the causes of this disturbance as alleged in Your o m o Highness' yad under reply to have emanated partly from British districts, 1 13 4have invited the Collector's attention thereto, but at the same time I must invite Your Highness' serious attention to the correspondence which has been going on upon this subject since April 1873, all of which tends to show that the cause of disorder rests with the Koolies of Petlaud District, who are now residing there, or have taken refuge in Kaira villages on the border owing to discontent caused by Your Highness' local revenue arrangements. ' 3. A perusal of the following correspondence will show that the present I have been always impressing on the Durbar the movement lb llieioly a Continuance of necessity of relieving immediate pressure prepara- what is therein referred to, and that the tory to a fixed settlement which will of course re- i n quire time. sole nieans ot remedying the evil lies in (Sd.)

I deem it necessary to place this record of events before Government at the present juncture without further comment than to invite attention to the fact that the Commission closed its sittings in December 1873; that the Commission Report was forwarded to the Durbar on the 11th April 1874 ; and that in a khureeta addressed to His Excellency the Viceroy and the Governor- General on the 19th Aprilj His Highness the Gaekwar assured the Govern ment of India 'that the reforms suggested by the Commission under Section 10 of the Report have already engaged my serious attention, &amp;c., &amp;c.

No. 1795C.15 ; dated Baroda, 24tb September 1874. From—Resident, Baroda, To—His Highness Gaekwar. The next subject to which I am instructed to invite Your Highness' serious attention for settlement according to equity and reason in connection with the khureeta of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, dated 25th July last, and the proceedings of the Baroda Commission, is that of the grievances of certain State and other bankers at Baroda, of certain jewellers and traders of Ahmedabad, and other places trading with Baroda as set forth in paragraph 8, groups, 8, 18, and 20 ; and cases 37, 57, 58, 61, and 62 of Schedule 11. and cases 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 of Schedule III. of the Commission Report. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General is of opinion that Your Highness would do well to put a stop to proceedings, such as those taken to wards respectable bankers and trading firms, which are described by the Com mission as discreditable and spoliatory, arbitrary, and unjust. I take this opportunity of bringing to Your Highness'notice that represent ations have recently been received from the firms of llurree Bhugtee, Chuni Lall titambur, Lowjee Oomed, Moti Lall Samul, Amtha Runchord, Rutunjee Khandass, and Banabai Lalbhai, which with other cases of this class will form the subject of negotiation prior to authoritative advice being ultimately offered regarding them should such appear necessary. Translation of Dnrbar yad, No. 1458, dated 17th August 1874. I have received the Residency yads, Nos. 1482C.2, 1483C .3., 1484C.4, 1485C.5, and 1486C.6, about the advice of His Excellency the Governor-Ge neral : with regard to these I have to state as follows :— With respect to yad No. l4il2C.2, requesting that the barbarous processes employed in my State for realizing the revenue should be prohibited, and stating that the matter being one of importance could not admit to delay, 1 beg to assure His Excellency that the matter has engaged by serious attention. The rules and mode of realizing the revenue and all such matters are at present under my consideration. A complete Revenue Code will be prepared as soon as possible, which will leave no room for committing oppression. Offenders in this respect will be duly punished. In yad No. 1483C.3 you have brought to notice the subject of a moderate and equitable land settlement and a faithful adherence to its terms in future, all further exactions of every sort or description being absolutely interdicted, and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part of Durbar officials being strictly forbidden. With regard to this I have to state that the last ten years' settlement has expired in most of the mehals, and it is necessary that for the current year some reasonable settlement of rates should be immedi ately made. Azum Kazee Shahabudin made enquiries with regard to the jum- mabundee of the four of the northern mehals, viz., Beejapur, Vusnuggur, Bur- nuo-gur, and Khyraloo, and has submitted a report, which not only suggests on an immediate reduction of rates but contains information which will be useful in 16making a settlement for a term of years. With regard to other mehals arrange ments will be made as soon as possible. In the Nowsaree districts the Hoozoor Soobha has been making the necessary enquiries, with a view to make reasonable reductions in the rates of assessment. The advice of His Excellency as regards the rates of juinmabundee will be carried out as soon as possible, the terras of settlement will be adhered to, and no illegal increase made, no oppressive prac tices on the part of the Durbar officials will be permitted, and any official found guilty thereof will be punished. Yad No. 1484C.4 relates to the adoption of some equitable mode of dealing with the wuttun and inams of my State, so as to remove all ground for anxiety and discontent among the holders of them. With regard to this I have to state that the wuttuns, which had been attached by His Highness Khunderao, were released from attachment last year, a general enquiry is to be made into the matter. 1 shall hereafter communicate ray views on the import ant subject of wuttuns and inams. Yad No. 1485C.5 has reference to the exercise of the strictest supervision over the subordinate officials, so as to prevent the horrible practices of torture which were established before the Commission, and to severely punish those who may be guilty of them. With regard to this 1 have to state that this important subject under notice has already engaged ray attention, and without loss of any time whatever such measures will be adopted as will, in my opinion, effect the desired reform. In yad No. 1486C.6 I have been requested to arrange that punishments awarded^ for offences bear some reasonable relations to the crimes committed, and be not scandalously excessive as in some of the cases proved before the Coraraission. With regard to this I have to state that this subject too has engaged ray attention. Better regulations for civil, criminal, and revenue matters than that now in force are under preparation. W hen those are brought into operation, several of the heads of advice given by His Excellency the Governor-General will have practical effect. I will at short intervals communicate to you, for the information of the Bombay Government and the Government of India, particulars as to the progress towards reform in each of the matters above set forth; and I will gladly avail myself of your advice as necessity arises. I trust that, if suitable opportunity is given to me, and I obtain hearty assistance frora you, I will be able to assure His Excellency the Governor- General that the confidence reposed in rae will not go tor nothing; and that every advice of His Excellency will be reallly carried out as soon as possible.

Yad No 1502O.7 state that His Excellency the Governor-General has directed you to urge on rae to conform to the recommendations of the Cora raission ^ In connection with this, I have been requested, in consultation with you to frame gereral rules for adoption m giving effect to reductions of Sirdars and Silladars, &amp;c. With regard to this some information is to be collected, arid the matter is to be fully thought over. I will therefore further communicate with you about it hereafter. [n vad No 1503C.8. the following subject was brought to my notice, that with the object of preventing the sale of appointments generally m my service by the levy of nuzzerana, and suppressing extortion on the part of 17 ' 5office-holders, that I should introduce the system of paying fair salaries for the performance of duty, and issued a proclamation forbidding the levy of nuzzerana on all appointments. Copy of such proclamation being furnished for the information of Government. \\ ith regard to this 1 beg to state that I am about to adopt full measures for giving adequate salaries to officials ; the practice of taking nuzzeranas has been done away with for some time past. Still a proclamation will be made as desired by the Resident, and a copy sent to the Residency. In yad No. 1518C.9 you requested me to put a stop to and severely punish any persons concerned in the abduction of women for forced service in the palace. With regard to this J beg to state that the forcible abduction of women for forced service does not take place. If any one is concerned in such oppression he will be punished.

With respect to this I beg to state that 1 quoted the decision of the Bombay Government about not interfer ing with the Gaekwar's family affairs in my yad No. 117 of 1874, and fully trust that the British Government will not interfere with the Gaekwar's family affairs. The arrangements for the near relatives of this Government are made according to their merits ; Rukmabai's case is known to you, and according to yad Xo. 1346 of 1874 sent (to the Residency) arrangements have been proposed for her in accordance with the advice of the Governor-General, and has been communicated to you orally. In yad No. 1534C.12 it is stated that a proclamation should be issued pro hibiting coporeal punishment of women and their oppression either in this or in any other way, in prison, courts, or by Police officers, and that whoever does so would be punished.

Residency yad No. 1732C.14, dated 16th September, stating that the ghasdhana due from the Bijapoor Thakoors should be fixed to a certain period not less than 10 years.

From—Governor of Bombay (demi-official), To His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Gibbs has written to me that a few days ago a native, whom he has known for several years, called on him, saying he was commissioned by the Gaekwar to mention that Dadabhoy had tendered his resignation, and to ask his advice as to the selection of a successor. Gibbs advised that he should place himself in Phayre's hands. I have answered Gibbs (and have made a corresponding communication to Phayre) that the native does not appear to have produced any credentials from the Gaekwar. That Phayre cannot recognize the fact of Dadabhoy's resigna tion having been tendered, unless informed of it by him or by the Gaekwar, and that under no circumstances should he give advice as to the selection of a successor. I mention this last point that you may be clearly aware of my belief that it is your intention to throw the whole responsibility on the Gaekwar, and to deprive him of the power of saying at the close that we recommended inefficient men.

No. 500 A., dated Baroda, 9th November 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to Government of Bombay. Referring to the enclosed copy of a telegram despatched by me yesterday to the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Governor, I have the honor to forward, for the information of Government, copy of my letter to the Residency Surgeon's address on the subject of his reply. I have found it impossible to prepare a full official report of the circums tances for despatch by this post, but hope to do so by the next one. Dated Baroda, 9th November 1874 (Confidential). From—Resident at Baroda, (demi-official). To—Residency Surgeon, Baroda. With reference to the circumstances that f mentioned to you this morning together with the symptoms which 1 described to you, and the contents of the tumbler which you took home with you, I should feel much obliged if you would kindly i&gt;ive me a professional opinion as to the nature of the contents of that tumbler whether poisonous or not. Although 1 only took two or three sips of the pummalo juice which the tumbler contained, I felt within about half an hour, as I described to you, a most unusual sickness of stomach, accompanied by dizziness in the head and of light, producing Confusion of thought, also a most unpleasant metallic taste in the mouth with slight salivation, such as I have never experienced before till within the last few days, and which I attributed partly to a slight attack of fever, which has however quite gone off, and partly to an idea that the pummalo, from which the juice daily placed on my table had been extracted were not fresh ones. I now, however, attribute all of these symptoms, especially that of this morning, to entirely different causes, in fact, 1 now believe that for the last few days small doses of poison have been introduced into this juice, and that had I drunk the whole tumbler off to-day 1 should have been very ill indeed. The confused state of my head has often surprised me of late, because for the last six weeks I have abstained in toto from wine and beer, &amp;c., except once or twice when friends dined at the Residency, and have found myself all the better for it. My general health is, as you know, most excellent, and therefore the symptom which I have described to you are I feel sure the result of unnatural causes. I never dreamt of poison, otherwise I should not have thrown away so much of the contents of the tumbler which I gave you this morning. It was only after doing so and when I was replacing the tumbler on the table, and saw the sediment at the bottom that I, for the first time, suspected foul play. Dated 9th November 1874. From—Residency Surgeon, Baroda, To—Resident at Baroda. In reply to your letter just received, 1 p.m., I have the honor to report that as far as my chemical appliances allow me to pronounce the opinion upon the» 7 , 23 quality of the sediment which you this morning entrusted to me for examination that sediment is arsenic. The quantity was sufficient to allow of its being tested by reduction with charcoal and the result I have shown you. The metallic ring deposited upon the tube in rich profusion and the velohedral crystals also deposited, point almost certainly to the presence of arsenic. I purpose despatching the remainder of the sediment by to-morrow's mail train to the Government Analyser. The quantity of sediment would almost assuredly have proved fatal had it been swallowed. Uatod Grant College Laboratory, 13tli November 1871. From—Acting Chemical Analyser to Government, Bombay, To—Private Secretary to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay. To the information regarding the Baroda poisoning case given in my telegram of to-day, 1 beg to add further that on Wednesday the llth, I received from Dr. Seward by letter a small packet containing one and a half grains of a greyish coloured powder, which on examination 1 found to consist in great part of com mon white arsenic. Some insoluble sediment which remained, I at first took to consist entirely of powdered glass or quartz, but a subsequent and closer examination has led me to think that a few glittering particles which the sediment also contained are diamond dust. Prom the exceedingly minute quantity of this substance and its state of fine subdivision, it is impossible to carry its examination futher than inspection and negative experiment. Although diamond dust is perfectly harmless, yet the natives of this country have a firm belief in its deadly poisonous properties. 1 was unable to discover any other poison than arsenic in the powder sent by Dr. Seward. 1 shall keep His Excellency informed of any further analyses I may be called upon to make in the present case.

In transmitting these papers I am desired to state that this Govern ment proposes to instruct the Resident to address to the Gaekwar the following communication;— ' I am instructed to remind Your Highness that you have been advised bv His Excellency the Viceroy to frame, in consultation with me, some general rules under which the expenditure incurred on account of the Silladars and others of the military classes may be reduced with due regard to the just claims of individuals and to the necessities of the State.24 «I am further to point out that within the last few days the public peace has been endangered by the assembly of large numbers of the military class, who have, in the most pressing manner, demanded an investigation of their grievances and a settlement of the arrears of pay which they allege to be due to them for two or three years past. ' I am to communicate to Your Highness the opinion of Government that it will be quite impracticable to carry out any rules, however equitable, if such be made for the future control of these military retainers, unless the disputes with regard to the past be first fairly investigated, and those claims which may be established be satisfied by the State. ' I am therefore instructed to advise Your Highness to proceed, with as little delay as possible, to appoint a Commission constituted in such a manner as to guarantee a full and fair enquiry, to hear and report upon all these claims, with a view to the early satisfaction of such as may be established before it.'

It appears in the instance under report that a Sirdar, by name Chandrao Rao Kudu, w T as accused by the said llukhmajee of having stated that on a recent occasion the sweatmeats, provided at a dinner party at Rukhmajee's, had been brought from the bazaar by a woman of the Mussulman caste. 4. The Maharaja, it appears, took this up warmly ; and according to custom the Sirdar was summoned to appear before the Synaputty to answer the charge which he did; and after due enquiry he was allowed to return to his home. This occurred on the 14th instant, and I have been informed that on the after noon of that day, in consequence of private information received that he was to be put in irons and carried off to jail, the Sirdar concealed himself during the whole of yesterday, when a strong body of Police and karkoons were in search of him. 5. This morning, however, he appeared in public in the house of a Sirdar, named Nana Sahib Powar attended by about 100 Silladars, Mankurees, &amp;c., and when an endeavour was made by the Police to arrest him, which the assembled Sirdars, Silladars, &amp;c., told them would be resisted, because the affair was not a criminal one; but a caste or religious dispute, which did not come within the jurisdistion of the Fouzdar, and that by Mahratta law and custom all persons, including the Maharaja himself, were equally subject to caste-rules in such cases. 6. About 1 p.m . Mr. Dadabhai came to the Residency, and having related the circumstances set forth, in the preceding paragraph informed me thatthe procedure determined upon by His Highness was to try Sirdar Chanderrao Kudu by the Sir Fouzdar, Mr. Hormusjee Wadia, on a criminal charge of defaming Rukhmajee, and if guilty, to punish him accordingly, and under the circumstances set forth, Mr. Dadabhai asked me to interfere with my authority to enforce the Durbar's procedure. 7. I replied that I did not see how I could properly interfere in the present stage of the case, that since May last caste disputes have been rife between His Highness and the Mahratta Sirdars, Silledars, and Mankurees in consequence of their having refused on religious grounds to eat with the complainant, Rukh majee. I, moreover, explained to Mr. Dadabhai that according to my present information I could not consider the Sirdar Kudu's alleged offence, as stated in paragraph 3 above, to be a criminal one ; that offences committed by the Sirdars are disposed of in the Senaputtee's Kutcherry, not in the Fouzdaree; and that if a caste offence had been committed, it appeared to me to be capable of adjustment by the Sirdar tendering an apology or making amends in such manner as the custom of the caste dictated. I added that my advice to His Highness was not to push matters to extremity, but to assure the Silledars, &amp;c., that the case Would be settled as caste disputes generally are, and that if thus relieved from the fear of criminal proceedings, they would probably disperse and give no further trouble. 8. I assured Mr. Dadabhai that I was quite willing to assist the Maha raja in all matters in which I felt I could do so with propriety; but that as I could not regard the Sirdar Kudu's alleged offence, as described to me, to be a criminal one, I could not interfere in the manner and on the basis proposed by him. 9. I am bound to say in conclusion* that I do not believe the case to be a bond fide one, but that it is merely a continuation of the efforts that have been already m ide, as reported to Government, to involve certain Mahratta Sirdars in ruin, owing to their having refused to break caste by eating with Luxmeebai's relatives. Telegram, dated 18th October 1874. From—Resident, Baroda, To—Political Secretary, Bombay. T h s caste dispute reported on 16th instant still goi jg on.

Dussera procession on Tuesday, and unless Durbar takes proper measures at once to settle dispute, I do not think it would be prudent for our troops to go to city to pay the usual honors to Gaekwar. No communication received from Durbar about continuance of dispute which is improper. Telegram, dated 19th October 1874. From—Political Secretary, Bombay, To—Resident, Baroda. Y our telegram of last night and letter 16th instant. Require Durbar to submit forthwith written statement of charge against Sirdar Kudu, and of the manner in which they propose to proceed against him; also of the present bearing of the Sirdars and their adherents, and amount and character of assistance solicited from you. If you anticipate disturbance at Dussera, intimate to Durbar that you are authorized to withhold troops from taking their usual part in ceremonies, and 25 726 to bold them in readiness in case their interference is required for maintenance of order. Suggest to Durbar propriety of placing tbe accused Sirdar under your temporary protection, witb a view to sucb enquiry on action being taken on the case after the Dussera as may be considered proper.

Both assured me that criminal proceedings against Sirdar Kudu had been abandoned on 16tli instant. But it appears doubtful whether any communication to that effect was made to the Sirdar.

I asked him whether he.had requested Kudu to tender an apology for the alleged offence, but he said that he had not. 1 was led to conclude, however, that the case was at an end, and up to the time of my writing this report (3 o'clock p.m .) I have heard nothing further from the Durbar on the subject. 2. I have learnt privately, however, from a reliable source that no com munication was yesterday made to the assembled Sirdars and Silledars as recom mended in paragraph 7 of my Report of that date; and consequently that at the time of Mr. Dadabhai's visit to the Residency this morning the whole of the Silledars, &amp;c., were still assembled at Sirdar Kudu's house, where they had remained all night. It is said, however, to have been intimated to them this morning that Mr. Dadabhai himself would go to speak to them in the course of to-day. The danger of such dilatoriness needs no comment. 3. I have frequently during the last year or so brought to the notice of Government the serious results that may at any moment ensue from the Sirdars and other Military classes of the State being in arrears of pay for upwards of three years; and 1 have been informed that the danger of an emevte has lately been heightened in consequence of the three Regular Native Infantry Regiments, &amp;c., of the Gaekwar's household Brigade being also four months in arrears, which I am informed has never before happened since they were raised, and that consequently they too have now become nearly as discontented as the Sirdars, Silledars, &amp;c., above referred to.27 n 4. I desire to bring to the prominent notice of Government that the Sirdars, Siliedars, &amp;c., are overwhelmed with debts which have been accumulat ing for the last century, and for which the Durbar is in a great measure respon sible ; and that instead of paying their arrears the Durbar has ordered the Bankers not only to refrain from making any advances to them, but to file suits against them, consequently being without the means of obtaining either credit or their just arrears of pay, they and their families and followers are thrown into circumstances of absolute want, from which I am satisfied the Gaekwar will never relieve them, unless under the pressure of authoritative advice from us. 5. Added to all this, the Durbar in its final state nent before the Commis sion on this class of cases has alluded to the ' necessity of a reduction in num bers of this as well as other departments of the State service, consequently on a probable decrease of the revenue from the proposed revision and lowering of the land assesment.' 6. Moreover, notwithstanding the present state of debt and arrears in which the whole mass is at present involved, a circular was issued on the 7th instant by the Maharaja to the effect that in order to reduce State expenditure from the current year onwards, no less than 25 per cent, will be deducted from the pay and allowances of Pagadars, Siliedars, Seebun^y, and other Karkhanedars, subordinate to the Native Commander-in-Chief (Senaputtee). 7. Thus from the two preceding paragraphs it is seen that reduction in the number of Sirdars, Siliedars, &amp;c., in the first instance, and an exces sive reduction of pay in the next, have been carefully provided for by the Dur bar, without any just or equitable provision whatever having as yet been made for either their debts, their-mrrears, or just grievances on loss of service. 8. I would respectfully submit that instead of the unreasonable reduc tions contemplated by the Durjbar being primarily carried out as apparently intended, the grave questions of their debts, their arrears, their just grivances, and their claims to compensation, gratuity, or pension, as the case may be, should first be considered and settled agreeably to the terms set forth in my yad to the Durbar, No. 1502C7, dated 12th August 1874). 9. Agreeably to the orders of Government, 1 have nearly every day for the last seven weeks carried on negotiations with Mr. Dadabhai about Sirdars' cases in addition to other work, and their agents attend at my Office daily in con nection therewith. Mr. Dadabhai himself appears willing enough to settle some of them, but the Maharaja, though professing to acquiesce in his proposals, has not as yet allowed an actual payment to be made. In fact, I regret to say that His Highness is still surrounded by certain bad characters, who support him in his revengeful feelings towards this class. 10. When writing to Government about the Contingent in my letter No. 246-843, dated 10th August last, I in the last paragraph particularly referred to the Military classes and copied in full my final statement regarding them, dated 1st January 1874, in order to call to remembrance the increasing danger of allowing such a large number of troops to fall into arrears of pay for so long a period; and I need scarcely say that the present state of aftairs cannot last much longer without a breach of the peace taking place, the responsibility for which will, I submit, rest solely on His Highness the Gaekwar, agreeably to the terms of His Excellency the V iceroy and Governor-General's khureeta dat^d 25th July last. 11. I will address you further on this subject as soon as I have fully considered what to recommend under the circumstances, and in the meantime do not delay this letter owing to the emergent importance of the question at issue.I Paragraph 8 of Commission Report, group 1, grievances of Sirdars, &amp;c. Paragraph 12 of Commission Report ami marginal note No. 343-1168, dated Baroda, 20th October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Tn the last paragraph of my letter No. 333-1148, dated 17th instant, I promised to submit to Government certain specitic proposals regarding what 1 consider to be the most important class of cases now pending. In order, however, that Government may be in possession of Du ootober a i874 0 ' 1S( 7 ' 111 1!Hh that has passed, I append copy of my yad to the Residency yad, No. 1982, dated 20th Durbar of last evening No. 1965, together with their reply and my rejoinder as per margin. 2. I am respectfully of opinion that the complexion which this important class of cases has now assumed renders it imperative in the interests of the peace and tranquillity of the country that some immediate action should be taken by Government and authoritative advice tendered to the Durbar. 3. The main points to which I would first invite attention are — l.«?/.—That the Sirdars, Silledars, Mankurees, Sindees, Arabs, &amp;c., adverted to in the Commission Report, are at the present, time in circumstances of absolute want, and quite independent of the settlement of the cases, require Appendix a ., case i. Schedule ii., Ap- • advances to be made to them at once in order to pendix o.. resident s schedule ii . preserve themselves and fam lies from starvation. 27idly. —That, as stated in paragraph 9 of my letter No. 333-1148, dated 17th instant, I have been in constant negotiation with Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee regarding the settlement of certain of these cases, but that up to the present time not only has not a single case been settled by the Maharaja as agreed upon between his Minister and myself, but, as in tke case of Sirdar Kudu instead of paying him his arrears, a criminal case was gut up against him for the purpose, as I believe, of getting rid of him altogether, and of intimidating the remainder. 4. With regard to the first of these points. Government will observe from the copy of my yad No. 1982 to the Durbar of this day's date (annexed) that I have proposed to meet the immediate emergency; that His Highness the Gaekw r ar should at once and without any further delay advance to all Sirdars, Silledars, &amp;c., and their adherents, who have been deprived of their pay for the last 3J years and upwards, from four to six months' pay according to circum stances. This measure I believe to be absolutely necessary to avert actual outbreak, and I would therefore earnestly recommend to Government that authoritative advice to this effect be at once tendered by Government. Unless this is done I think it my duty clearly to state that I cannot be responsible for any consequences that may ensue. 5. Next with regard to the enquiry into and settlement of these cases, I would respectfully invite attention to the following points :— 1^.—That every single individual whose case is under jurisdiction is deeply involved in debt to Baroda Bankers and others, which debts have been caused by a variety of circumstances, but chiefly by the arbitrary and capricious manner in which their pay and allowances have from time to time been reduced or stopped altogether by the present Maharaja and his predecessors. ^ndly.—That any settlement which may be made must provide some means for the liquidation of these debts in proportion to the responsibilities— (a) Of the Sirdar or Silledar himself. (h) Of the head of the Earoda State. (c) Of the Banker who has probably been willing enough to advance money at usurious interest. Zrdly. —That if loss of service and consequent reduction in the number of these hereditary servants is, under present circumstances, to be the basis of 28s ^ settlement of any of these cases, utter ruin must be the result to the individual concerned and the whole of his family and following. 6. It will thus be observed that this last point constitutes the main diffi culty in the settlement of these cases. The Durbar have already intimated to the Commission their intention to reduce the number of this class ostensibly for the purposes of economy, but practically speaking no economy either has been or will be effected, because, as a general rule, new favorites are usually substituted for old and hereditary families. 7. Were it not for the accumulation of debt and the proposed reduction, the settlement of these cases might be effected without the least difficulty, except for the personal animosity and revengeful feelings entertained towards the class by His Highness the Gaekwar. I have myself during the last seven weeks prepared what I believe to be fair settlements of several of the most important of these cases for the purpose of negotiation with His Highness' Minister. 8. The principles which have guided me in these negotiations are shown in the statement annexed* (marked A), which I drew up and showed to Mr. Dadabhai as forming the basis upon which I should advise Government to act in any cases that we might not be able to arrange amicably. 9. I have also prepared notes of about 20 of these cases, and have given them to Mr. Dadabhai at his special request, in order to assist him in procuring a settlement of them from the Maharaja, which in several instances he has professed to do, without however any actual results except verbal promises which hitherto have not been carried out. 10. It will thus be seen that I have from the commencement cordially given to Mr. Dadabhai every assistance in my power, in fact I may confidently say that, but for my assistance, he would have been from his uttermexperience in the details of administration utterly unable to have grasped the general principles upon which alone any Statesmanlike settlement of these difficult cases could be effected. 11. Bearing in mind the serious complexion that affairs have now assumed in consequence of the non-settlement of this class of cases, I deem it my duty to express to Government my conviction that no satisfactory settlement of them, including debts and arrears, can possibly be attained, until I am formally empowered to arbitrate, and adjudicate in them, subject to the approval of Government, the Durbar having already stated all they had to urge in each before the Commission. In order, however, to enable me to do this effectually, I must be invested with powers to call upon the Durbar to produce from the Sirdars, the Bankers, and State records such evidence as I may require, and until that is done I believe that the Maharaja will merely go on temporizing until a general outbreak takes place. No. 1965, dated 19th October 1874'. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar. Referring to personal communications which passed betwen Your Highness' Minister, Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, and myself on the 14th, 16th, and 17th instant, relative to the case of Sirdar Chandra Rao Kudu and certain Sirdars, Silledars, &amp;c., associated with him, said to amount in all to about 500 men, also to the further conference which took place this morning on the same subject between Your Highness, Mr. Dadabhai, and myself, I should feel obliged by your inform ing me as soon as possible whether the said Sirdars and Silledars have dispersed and preceded to their respective homes or not. \. Also whether, referring to my yad No. 1502C7, dated 12tli August 1874, any, and, if so, what, steps have been taken by Your Highness towards settling the grievances of this class. If these men have, as I am informed, declined to disperse up to the hour of despatch of this yad (5-15 p.m .), it will be necessary for me to advise Your Highness to take such immediate measures as may appear to be required to maintain order during the approaching Dussera festival to-morrow. It will also be my duty, under instructions from Government, to refrain from attending the festival with British troops, unless I am satisfied that such step will be taken by Your Highness' Government with regard to the Sirdars, Silledars, &amp;c., in question as will obviate any risk of a disturbance occurring. Translation of Durbar yad No. 1867, dated 19th October 1874. I have received your yad No. 1965, dated 19th October 1874, stating that certain Sirdars and Silledars had assembled in the matter of Chandra Rao Kudu, &amp;c., &amp;c. With regard to this I have the honor to state that on the return of my Uevvan to the palace after having had an interview with you this morning, I, in order that there should be no misunderstanding about my orders, sent the Silledars' Baxee, Seebundy Baxee, and Kamdar of the Hoozrat Paga accompanied by Rajeshree Bala Mungesh Wagle. They in pre sence of about 60 or 70 people assembled near Chandra Rao Kudu's house, told the latter that ' your case has been brought to a close, no proceedings will be taken against you. In connection with the joy arising from the birth of a son to His Highness, he has abandoned this business and brought it to a conclusion. No one should therefore be anxious about it, and that all should return to their respective homes.' The pith of what the people assembled said was this—' All of us have some other grievances; unless all these are settled we would not go from here.' This was reported to me by Rajeshree Bala Mungesh AVagle, whom I sent again to ascertain what their complaints were. He and the people spoke to each other, and they finally said—' \Ve would attend to-morrow's processio i • Or as in former years (Thursha (sOWaree) aS USUal,* there W r ill be UO obstruction ill Peumanay). that. To-day the wiiole of our people (' Mandlee') are not here, and therefore we ^annot give a reply to-day. After giving ' sona' (leaves distributed in Dussera) they would think over the matter on Thursday and give a reply, and until our complaints are settled (' khoolasa hoi') we would not return to our respective homes. People coming to-morrow's sowarree according to custom will not be hindered by us. General particulars in reply to the above yad will be hereafter communicated. No. 198*2, dated 20th October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. With reference to Your Highness' yad No. 1867 of yesterday's date, received last night, and also adverting to the oral communications made to me yesterday evening by Your Highness' Minister and Mr. Bala Mungesh, after the latter had visited the Sirdars, Silledars, &amp;c., at Sirdar Kudu's house, I have reason to believe that there is no fear of the peace being disturbed at the Dus sera procession to-day, and therefore the British troops, &amp;c., will attend to accord the military honors to Your Highness customary on the occasion. With reference to the desire which the Sirdars, &amp;c., expressed to Mr. Bala Mungesh to assemble together again on Thursday next, the 22nd instant, for the purpose of representing their grievances generally, I would recommend for Your Highness' consideration that it should be notified to them that a fair 3031 hearing of what they have to state will be accorded to them on some early date that may be named, and as absolute want arising from excessive arrears of pay appears to be their most pressing grievance, as communicated by me personally to Your Highness yesterday, I would suggest for your consideration that pend ing the final settlement of each man's case, which will take time, advances on account of their arrears varying from four to six months, according to circum stances, may be granted to them. Thus their immediate wants will be relieved and the enquiry into, and settlement of, their just claims will proceed without fear of further demonstration of the dangerous kind that has been going on for the last four or five days. A. Rough notes by Colonel Phayre, C.B., Resident, Baroda, embodying- the general principles upon which he considers the settlement of the cases of the Sirdars and military classes of the Baroda State, whose grievances were represented to the Baroda Enquiry Commission in November 1873, should be based. T he Sirdars, Silledars, and Mankurees, &amp;c., who appeared before the Baroda Enquiry Commission are, generally speaking, men of old and highly respectable Deccan families, whose ancestors supported by their dependents accepted service under the Gaekwar Government, achieved its conquests in Guzerat, and durin 0, a long course of years exercised a most beneficial influence in tranqui- lizin' 1 the country and consolidating the Gaekwar's power over his possessions, many of them are moreover nearly related to the Gaekwar family by birth or intermarriage on both sides. Their services were, according to the custom of Mahratta Governments, remunerated by military and personal grants of various kinds, such as jaghires, enams, wuttuns, pagas, silledaree service, &amp;c., most of which, independently of Sunnuds and other documents in possession of the holders, would appear to have become hereditary by uninterrupted enjoyment and possession for periods varying from GO years to upwards of a century. Durin 0, the settlement of the Sattara and other Deccan Sirdars and Jaghire- Vide Bombay Selection, N„. si, 1856,, dare, &amp;c., many were maintained in their possessions page 25, Deccan Surinjains. for the purpose of avoiding popular discontent and the fall of families of antiquity and respectability. ' Where a jaghire was, by the original grant, made hereditary in the family of the grantee there could be no doubt of the right of the descendant; but where there was no such grant mi . . „ (as was the case with almost all the iaghires) the This is generally the case m Baroda. V 410 , , ,. „ , . . . J 0 „ ' .. (sd.) R f. right rested on difierent grounds arising trom the tenure of jaghires, not by express grant, but by length of possession.' ' First class jaghires were thus held hereditary in the fullest sense. Second class jaghires were ordered to be resumed after the second generation, with a pensionary provision equal to half the proceeds of the jaghire lands for the generation next succeeding. In the third class pensions equal to half the net proceeds of jaghires were given.' The antiquity of a portion of a jaghire is not to be looked upon as the anti quity of the whole of it. Grants on marriage and palanquin allowances were held to be hereditary in some instances. With regard to the grants made by the Gaekwars immediately under con sideration it 'was generally understood by the recipients that so long as they continued' to fulfil the terms of their service with good faith, integrity, and fidelity, their holdings would be continued to them without any interruption from the Gaekwar Government.The varieties of circumstances iu whicli the different Sirdars, Pagadars, Silledars, &amp;c., of the Baroda State are placed relatively to the Gaekwar are numerous, some are relatives of the reigning family, and for a great number of years have been provided with handsome allowances as such, others have held hereditary service from the time of the conquest of the country by the Gaekwar, some of whom have in their possession Sunnuds and other documents con ferring upon them, their heirs and successors, lands, houses, cash allowances, pagahs, or other military service in perpetuity. Reductions iu the strength of the contingent of 3,000 horse are impossi ble under Treaty.* Reductions of grants of various kinds made in the Hoozoorat or local service of the Gaekwar as organized like the contingent under Sirdars, Pagadars, Silledars, Sebundee, &amp;c., can only be justly effected by enquiring into the claims of individuals, and awarding to them compensation, gratuity, or pen sion according to the circumstances of each individual case, for instance, a Sirdar holds a Paga of a hundred horse, which his ancestors perhaps ori ginally raised, equipped, and maintained for a number of years expressly for the Gaekwar Government, the same Paga having been handed down here ditarily in the family during the lapse of time large debts have now been both inherited and incurred in connection with it. If the reduction of such a Paga for the purpose of State economy be determined upon by the Gaekwar Government, it is only equitable and just that the accounts of the Paga be enquired into in order to ascertain the number of debts, how and when incurred, &amp;c. Moreover the Pagadar is entitled to com pensation for loss of his hereditary service and other contingencies consequent upon the reduction. In addition to this the claims of himself and his men to gratuity or pension according to the number of years' service performed have to be considered and settled. A Paga which has been handed down from generation to generation for 60 years and upwards partakes of the character of a wuttun or hereditary office, means of subsistence or patrimony, iu which the different members of the family, brothers and other male relatives, hold shares, and therefore when a One of these is Contingent, the other Sirdar is suddenly dismissed, as Dliumdheyra, or Hoozoorat. Shaha Mahomed Radham Meeya, and numerous others of the military class have been, it involves themselves, their families, and dependants in absolute ruin. In the irregular cavalry regiments of the British Government (Sind Horse for instance) a Silledar, who possesses one or more assamees, is allowed to sell them for whatever value they may fetch in the Brigade. His horses and other private property are disposed of separatelv, and he himself receives gratuity or pension according to the rules of the service, and no native officer or soldier is ever deprived of his property in the regiment except under rules providing for cases of misconduct. In several instances brought before the Commission it was established that not only have certain Sirdars and Silledars, both of the Contingent of 3,000 Horse and of the Hoozoorat, been arbitrarily deprived of their hereditary appointments, allowances, &amp;c., without compensation, for no fault whatever, but also that their horses and equipments and other bona fide private property are seized by the Gaekwar Government, e.g., the case of 62 horses of Sawal Beebar in the Kattywar Contingent, 87 horses of Dhumdheyra in the Deesa Contingent, and many others. Successive Gaekwars have, as a general rule, for the last 100 yejirs and Paragraphs i to s upwards, upheld the general principles specified in the first few paragraphs of these notes, and on • Some of the worst cases of tyranny and spoliation have occurred in the contingent and arc utterly inexcusable. (Sd.) R. P. 32^oing through the several cases of Sirdars, Silladars, &amp;c., which came before the Commission, it will be seen that it is only w ithin the last 6 or 8 years, but chiefly during the present reign, that cases have occurred which have led His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General to order His Highness the present Gaekwar ' to pay due consideration to the claims of the parties concerned, and to prevent the scandal and risk that must attend the sudden deprivation without compensation or other provision of any sort of large numbers of old or here ditary military servants of the service on which they are wholly dependant for the means of subsistence.' Moreover, that ' misrule on the part of a Government, which is upheld by the British Government, is misrule in the responsibility for which the British Government becomes in a measure involved, that the Gaekwar as sovereign of Baroda is responsible for exercising his sovereign powers with proper regard to his duties and obligations alike to the British Government and to his subjects.' His Lordship further deemed it necessary to remind the Gaekwar that ' both by the terms of treaties and by constant usage the British Government has the right to advise him in public concerns affecting the good of the country, and to require the settlement according to equity and reason of any measures shown to be improper or unjust, and that by consequence it is at liberty to take such steps as it may deem necessary for the just exercise of that right and the fulfilment of the obligations to the ruler and people of Baroda which flow therefrom, that from the earliest period of its connection with the Baroda State the British Government has repeatedly found it necessary to intervene in Baroda affairs. This intervention has not been limited to the case of the guarantees to which His Highness has referred, but lias been exercised in a variety of other ways, as for example by investing the Resident with power of control over the finances, by assuming for a time the management of portions of the State, by the removal of evil advisers, in short whenever intervention has been deemed by the British Government necessary in the interests of the ruler or his subjects.' Enclosure No. 22. No. 6678, dated Bombay Castle, 13th November 1874. From—Secretary to Government of Bombay, To—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of the papers on Baroda affairs ending with my letter of the 2nd instant, No. 6378, 1 am directed to forward to you, for submission to the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a letter, with enclosures, from the Resident at Baroda, No. 350-1196, dated the 27th ultimo, regarding the action taken by the Durbar in the matter of the Sindhees and Arabs in the Baroda State. No. 350-1196, dated Baroda Residency, 27th October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. In forwarding, for the information of Government, copies of my yad No. 1986 of this date and accompaniment, 1 have the honor to bring to notice that the action of His Highness regarding these Sindhees who with the Arabs are fast getting beyond the control of their Sirdars and Jemadars, and may at any moment burst forth into open rebellion, appears to me to be most unjust and mischievous. 2. On the Sind Frontier we have reclaimed thousands of the same class of people by taking great pains to provide land for them, encouraging 33 9them to cultivate and follow peaceable occupations; and although the Sirdars of these men have spontaneously initiated the system in Baroda territory, yet it will be seen from the accompaniments to this letter that the Durbar, instead of supporting and encouraging it, is doing all in its power to drive this ignorant but warlike race to desperation. 3. The Sindhees and Arabs in the Baroda State are the least under con trol, and more likely than any others of the military classes to attempt to obtain their just rights by rebellion. 4. I need scarcely say that the system of populating the large extent of unoccupied and waste lands which now exists on the Baroda State by the superfluous military element in the service is one, which if rightly applied, would soon prove to be of the greatest benefit to the Baroda State, and provide a remedy for the gross injustice and consequent danger of turning large num bers of old and faithful soldiers adrift without compensation, gratuity, or pension. —Attention is solicited to the Sirdar cases, Nos. 9, 11, 13, 15 and 30, Appendix A., Schedule II.

Instead of such a desirable mode of providing for superfluous military retainers being encouraged, as it ought to be, it appears from the petition of these poor people that the very reverse is the case.

Now that the peace of the country is endangered on all sides, 1 must beg seriously to press upon Your Highness' notice that nothing short of an imme diate performance of the promises which you have from time to time made to Government during the last year and upwards will satisfy His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General that there is any meaning or reality in those promises.

Shah Maho- miusioners' Report. med* bin Radhunnieea's ancestor, the late Hamed Jemadar entered the service of the Gaekwar Government in about Sumbut 34rz3 1821, or A.I). 17(54. Since that time Harned Jemadar and his descendants, Ameen Saheb, &amp;c., brought our ancestors from our own country, Sind, and intro duced them into the service of the Gaekwar Government as useful to ti^ht and conquer territories lor them, and as our Jemadar obtained Wuttuns, &amp;c., from the Gaekwar Government, who considered them as their children, so find ing us useful in the conquest of countries, some of our ancestors obtained monthly emoluments and appointments, and others landed property, thus leaving our own country we settled in this strange land, and we were taken care of by the Gaekwar Government as arranged by our Jemadars. Since our settlement here we acquired landed property by purchase and mortgage, and continued enjoyim'- them without obstruction. In the reign of the late Khunderao Maharaj they commenced forcibly levying Note. —The petitioners produced what from us Inam Committee and other cesses, but on purports to be a formal order of the our representimj the matter to Government these late Maharaja expressly exempting the P 11 , i laud held by them on 'the Baroda per- CCSSCS Were not Collected. gunnah from the payment of new cess. Meanwhile Mulhar Rao Maharaj ascended the throne, and a rumour was circulated that the I nam Committee fee was abolished, which pleased the people very much. Subse quently Khanvelker, the brother-in-law of the Maharaja, became Minister, and the 1 nam Committee and other new cesses were ordered to be levied; and the A\ ahivutdars commenced pressing us for the payment of these cesses. Finally, our Jemadar Radhunmeea was adopted by Shah Mohmed with the sanction of the Gaekwar Government, and the management was conducted by him, although no emoluments were paid, and many of us too dia not receive our proper emo luments, which incovenienced us very much in our expenses. We several times petitioned Government to make proper arrangements, but obtained no redress ; we were thus distressed in every way, and therefore reported the matter to you ; before the Commission our Jemadar represented all our grievances, and peti tioned the Bombay and India Governments, but nothing has been arranged. After this Dadabhai was appointed Minister in the place of Khanvelker, who was made Pritinidhi; and we petitioned Dadabhai personally for redress, but did not attain it. Meanwhile the Wahivutdars continued pressing us for the pav- ment of the new cesses, so we reported the matter, but obtained no reply. Our helplessness increased daily ; at last we sent a registered petition by post on the 2nd of Bhadursud Wud Sumbut 1931, and enclosed one anna postage stamp for a reply, but up to this no arrangement has been made, neither have we received a reply. If we poor people go to the house of the Minister Dadabhai, we find him secluded, and with great difficulty get the sepoys to convev our message and receive a reply to come to the Palace. Very often our message even is not conveyed; thus although we go there we very seldom get a replv. If we go to the Palace, we, sepoys, cannot effect an entrance owing to our arms; but should we finally succeed in getting into the Palace we find the Dewan engaged on important business of the State, and he does not think of the case of us poor people, neither do we receive a written reply. If we wish to com plain orally we cannot get in owing to the large gathering in the Durbar ; and if we wish to speak we cannot do so, because people are warned that they are not to speak until they are called. It is therefore difficult to see the Dewan in the Palace, and the Dewan himself does not send for us, because we are poor and our complaint is trifling; and for want of funds we are unable to engage a Vakeel to plead our cause, for these reasons we cannot obtain redress from the Durbar. If we send reports they are never heard of; we cannot even find out where they go to. Our last registered report has not as yet been replied to. We therefore n -w beg to state that we • N ote .—They h»ve W,., referred to the ha j e alread y Petitioned JOU 01106 before, 'urbar up to the present time when the matter has and being quite helpless, petition yOU Durbar up become serious.

Our ancestors acquired these our Wuttuns by shedding blood, and we are deterred from enjoying them owing to the obstructions complained of above ; those obstructions are not removed and no arrangements to continue our rights to us are made; but we hear that a reduction 0 of 25 per cent, in the emoluments has been ordered by Government. As shown above, we are quite destitute for want of food and clothing, and have contracted hundreds of rupees debt, and if the above order about reduction is brought into fone, ourselves, -our wives and children will have to die. We request, therefore, that you will take all these circumstances into consideration Note .—The same complaint is general everywhere. and make early arrangements for US At (sd.) r. p . present our crops are standing in the nelas, and the time for reaping has arrived; if we attempt to reap them the A\ aln- vutdar prevents us from doing so, and places Mohsals for the collection of new cesses named above. The crops standing in the fields are partly destroyed by birds and animals. These oppressions annoy us, and the state of the crops ready for harvest is as stated above. Some have sublet their lands to those that have no land of their own, they too are obstructed, this leaves us entirely destitute. Strict arrangements should therefore be made to put a stop to Mohsals and to allow us to reap our crops. Owing to the reduction of 25 per cent, ordered, the Sowcars do not trust us. We have petitioned the Bombay Government on the same object, copy of which, as also the copy of our petition to the Calcutta Government, is hereto appended for your information. If you take the circum stances of this petition into consideration and make proper arrangements for us it is well, otherwise each day will add to our hardships. Arrangements should therefore be made within eight days, and a reply given to us. One anna post age stamp is enclosed for a reply. No. 2693, dated 8th November 1873. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar o£ Baroda. T he day before yesterday and to-day I have received most urgent petitions This petition was brought to the notice of the frOUl the SindheeS &lt;111(1 Aiabs of V ou1 Comniission by the Resident in November 1873. Highness' Service Complaining of the long Nothing done yet. ( sd ) R p arrears of pay due to them, and stating October 1874. that as the bankers will not give them any more credit they and their families are reduced to a state of destitution, and are almost in despair. I have frequently brought the subject of the arrears of pay and allowances due to these and other subjects to your notice, and the Durbar have long since promised me to settle all their demands, but nothing has as yet been done. Chits have, 1 believe, been issued in some instances, but these chits have not been paid. Your Highness will see that this case is the first on the list in Schedule No. III. forwarded to-day, but as I consider the case of these Arabs and Sindhees both at Baroda and in the districts to be of the utmost importance in connection with the peace and tranquillity of the country, 1 hope you will be so kind as to satisfy their just demands as soon as possible. I again repeat that this matter is a most serious and emergent one. Petition of the Sindhees, Jemadars, &amp;c., in the service of the Gaekwar State, dated Kartig Sud 15th St. 1930=4th November 1873. I n order to obtain a Government for His Highness the Gaekwar we were made to leave our native country of Sind, and brought to this country through 36'Hummeed Jemadar and Ameen Saheb. Since that date we entered the service of the Gaekwar State through the said Jemadars, and also served in the Karkhanas of the said Jemadars. We have worked very hard and obtained a government for His Highness the Gaekwar, and added to it. In this matter several of our ancestors and others were killed and wounded; for these services, and for our having been obliged to leave Sind, our native country, our people obtained hereditary service (Wuttundari) in the Gaekwar State, and the heredi tary service has descended from generation to generation. Notwithstanding this, some time ago the Maharaj Mulharrao has dismissed the Karkhanas of Jemadar Shah Mahomed Meea Saheb bin Radha Meea Saheb, &amp;c., and their pay for three years is in arrears. The current is the fourth year. Not a single pice has been received from Government for expenditure, still the said Jemadar and the sowars and footmen under him and we have continued to serve the Gaekwar Government up to to-day without any pay. We and the people belonging to the Karkhana of Jemadar Shah Mahomed Meea Saheb bin Radha Meea • Saheb have not received any pay for the last 3^ years, so we sold what things we had, and maintain ourselves by contracting loans from sowcars so long as they lent us the money, and we have been serving the Gaekwar Government in this way. Now no one lends us any money, nor has anything been left with us except our arms, and the persons to whom we, the said Jemadar and the people of his Karkhana, o.ve money, press us hard for what is due, and they threaten our reputation. Now all of us are starving. What will a starving man not do? This Your Honor will take into consideration. We may obtain the salary of our hereditary service from His Highness in our own way; but it occurs to us that Your Honor may interpose, in order that we may realize our pay according to our custom, because a cordial friendship has long existed betwen Her Majesty's Government and Gaekwar Government. We therefore bring the circumstances of our case to Your Honor's notice, which you will take into consider ation, and speedily arrange that the hereditary service of us, the Sindhee people and of the Jemadar, may be continued in the Gaekwar Government as heretofore, and that the salary for the past years, which is in arrears, may be at once disbursed to us. If Yoiw Honor cannot arrange accordingly, we will obtain our pay from His Highness the Gaekwar, and that the British Government should not inter fere. There is no delay in our obtaining our pay from the Gaekwar Govern ment. We will do so in le%s than an hour, which we write for your informa tion, because the creditors annoy us, and we and our wives and children cannot suffer the pangs of hunger ; we and our wives and children have suffered this hardship for the last 3 or 3^ years, and at what length should we represent this our state of helplessness to Your Honor. We now helplessly represent to Your Honor that if you will take the above circumstances into your consideration, and arrange about us speedily in a very short time, it will be all right, otherwise we shall do what suoforests itself to us ; this must be understood as certain. We O O ' have presented detailed yads as to different persons to His Highness the Maharaj, and some to Your Honor, with a view to our affairs being arranged. We hope that Your Honor will kindly arrange all our affairs. This is our petition. Translation of Durbar Yad, No. 2420, dated 11th November 1873.

I am directed to forward to you a khureeta, of which copy is enclosed for your information, from His Excellency the Viceroy to His Highness the Gaek- war on the subject of the Report of the Baroda Commission, and I am to request that you will place it as soon as possible in the hands of His Highness without comment of any kind. Should the Gaekwar make any reply, it should in like manner be acknowledged with an intimation that it will be forwarded to Government. You will shortly receive full instructions as to the steps which it will be your duty to take in connection with this matter. No. 22P., dated 6th August 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Resident at Baroda. In connection with the khureeta from His Excellency the \ iceroy to His Highness the Gaekwar, already forwarded to you with my letter No. 21P. of 31st July, I am now directed to communicate for your guidance a copy of letter No. 1586 of 25th ultimo, from the Government of India, and to add the following instructions from His Excellency the Governor in Council. 2. Prom the 8th and following paragraphs of the letter of the Government of India you will perceive that you are directed to offer authoritative advice to the Gaekwar on the points dealt with in the recommendations of the Commission, the most important of which are set forth by the Government of India. These points are recapitulated in this letter, with subsidiary directions in the margin on the part of His Excellency in Council. 3. Before determining the advice to be offered on each point. His Excel lency in Council desires that you will communicate on the subject freely and in a friendly manner with the Gaekwar or his Minister; that you will then reduce the advice to wiiting in concise language, and submit it for the approval of Government before formally presenting it to the Durbar for adoption. After the advice has been finally settled and given, it will be your duty to note care fully in what way it is acted on, and to warn the Gaekwar in writing, in brief and considerate terms, of each instance of neglect to follow it within a reasonable time, and to furnish Government with a copy of such warning. You should in no in stance, unless specially authorized by Government, insist on the advice being fol lowed, but should simply inform the Gaekwar that he is still free to act on his judg ment, but that a note' has been taken of his inattention to the advice given. In this way alone can the orders of the Government of India, for giving the Gaekwar a fair trial, be carried out, and moreover no other way is likely to be so effectual in inducing His Highness to alopt the desired reforms. 4.- You will doubtless perceive that, by the orders of the Government of India, the choice of the Minister is left entirely with His Highness.5. I am directed also to observe that a careful moderation and courtesy in your communications with the Gaekwar, whether written or oral, and a scru- puious regard for his dignity, is rendered even more necessary than before by the present situation. 6. The recapitulation of the most important points on which advice is to be given, alluded to above in paragraph 3, will occupy the remainder of this letter. 1. Military reductions. —The Gaekwar ' should be advised, in consultation with the Eesident, to frame some general rules for adoption in giving to effect to such reductions in future, which will en sure their being carried out with due consideration to the claims of the parties concerned, and will prevent the scandal and the risk that must attend the sud den deprivation without compensation or other provision of any sort of large numbers of old or hereditary military servants of the service on which they are wholly dependent for the means of sub sistence.' In tendering this advice you should 2. ' lie should be advised to make a settlement recognise tlie 8dmission 01 tlie C^om* q it /'^i j i • n • i /» mission that the demands do not t)I tllG (jrllclStl&lt;XI13» CicliniS lOT 3. pGriOQ of yGtlTS. appear to have been excessive, and that what is to he chiefly desired is a fixed arrangement to last for not less than ten vears. You should note that this direction points exclusively to the establishment of proper Rules under which the future operations of the Durbar for reducing their military expenditure are to bo carried out. If you should be pressed by any of those whom the Commission held to have been unjustly treated, to obtain compensation for them, you will apply for instructions before making any authoritative representation to the Durbar. This will not preclude friend ly suggestions for an equitable settle ment. Before formally advising the issue of the proclamation, you may well explain that the object of preventing this species of sale of office is to in troduce the system of paying fair and equitable salaries for the performance of duty, and to suppress' extortion on the part of office-holders. No action should be taken on this by you pending further orders. This will admit of no delay. This instruction is of a very import ant and comprehensive character, and before formally advising it, you should invite an expression of opinion by the Durbar, to be submitted to Govern ment with your own observations. This advice should be given at once. The directions in para. 6 will applv to this also. Advice to this effect should be given at once. The instruction should be acted on at once. 40 3. To forbid the levy of nuzzerana on appoint ments, and to issue a proclamation notifying the same, a copy being furnished for the information of Government. 4. To take no acc ession nuzzerana where there is a fixed land settlement. 5. To prohibit the barbarous processes employed for realizing revenue. 6. And to remove the cause of such difficulty by a moderate and equitable land settlement, and a faithful adherence to its terms in future, all future exactions of every sort or description being abso lutely interdicted, and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part of Durbar officials being strictly forbidden. 7. To exercise the strictest supervision over the subordinate officials, so as to prevent the hor rible practices of torture which were established before the Commission, and to severely punish those who may be guilty of them. 8. To adopt some equitable mode of dealing with the Wuttuns and Inams, so as to remove ail ground for anxiety and discontent among the hol ders of them. 9. To see that punishments awarded for offences bear some reasonable relation to the crimes committed, and be not scandalously excessive, as in some of the cases proved before the Commission. 10. To put a stop to proceedings such as those taken towards respectable bankers and trading firms, which are described by the Commission as 'dis creditable and spoliatory,' 'arbitrary and unjust.'And in tins case also. And in this also. And in this also. This requisition should be made immediate in the case of Rukhmahaee. No communication should be made to the Gaekwar or to the Durbar about any other lady, without previous consultation with Government. The Gaekwar should at once be made acquainted with the opinion en tertained by the Viceroy of the Minis ters named, for the consequence of whose retention in office he will be fully responsible. 11. To put a stop to and severely punish any person concerned in the abduction of women for forced service in the Palace, in respect to which the Commission record ' that several cases of the description stated have undoubtedly occurred, in volving an abuse of power on the part of the Maharaja and oppression by certain inferior Durbar officials and servants, which have brought a most serious scandal on the personal character of the Chief himself, and the administration of which he is the head.' 12. To prohibit the infliction of corporal punishment on women, and to issue a proclamation absolutely interdicting under severe penalties the personal ill-treatment in this or any other way of females, whether in Jail or before the Courts, or under examination by the Police, and to forward a copy of the proclamation for the information of Government. 13. • The Gaekwar should further be required to desist from the harsh and vindictive treatment of the relatives and dependants of the late Chief, and extend to them the justice and consideration due to their position and services. 14 He should be required to make suitable provision for all the immediate members of the late Gaekwar's family, and permit the ladies to reside away from Baroda. Their allowances should be fixed with the approval of the Government of Bombay, and they can be paid according to lists to be iurnished by the Gaekwar, the money being recovered from the Baroda State. 15. ' It only remains to say that, judging from the information submitted by the Commission, His Excellency in Council cannot hope that the neces sary reforms will be effected so long as the Dewan Syajee Kao and some other officials, notably Bul- wunt Rao Deo, the Bevenue Commissioner Huriba Gaek'vv ar, the Sir 1 ouzdar Bulwunt Rao Eshwunt, and the Deputy Bevenue Commissioner Narayen Bhai, remain in power. His Excellency in Council is therefore of opinion that His Highness would do well to remove these men from office, making for them such provision as His Highness may deem reasonable, and to appoint more suitable persons to fill the offices they hold.' No. 244-840, dated Bnroda, 10th Aug-ust 1874. J'lom llesident at Baroda, Secretary to the Government of Bombay. No. LpTdated 6?hT ns t t 0 an a t Ckn0Wledge ^ 0f ^ confidential letter when'? mo , 1 '' in S 'k Highness the Gaekwar paid me his usual visit, to in Hi, P i? him that instructions as to the authoritative adviee referred His Excellency the Viceroy 's khureeta to his address had been received 41 1142 * by me, and that I would communicate their tenor to him from time to time as appeared advisable. 3. I then told His Highness of the advice expressed in the accom- panyinff copy of my yad to his address, and said that the first and most important point of all at the present time was to form an administration of experienced men of known character and ability, who would be able to afford him real aid in settling the several subjects which have to be dealt with; and I added that I should be happy to consult orally with him first as to this important point, and after communicating to Government the result of our deliberations, offer him such written advice as the Government might finally approve of. 4. I have thus commenced the routine laid down in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, and will continue it on each subject separately. 5. His Highness asked me for a copy of my instructions, but I told him that such was not necessary, nor could it be complied with; but I promised that I would quote for his information what was proper in each case. 6. He expressed himself satisfied and Rao Saheb Bapoobhai is to bring up to-day lists of the appointments he wishes to be filled up, and by whom. 7. I told His Highness that the most important departments of his State with which we should have most to do were the lleveuue and Police Depart ments ; and after discussing details and getting some insight into the present system in force, of which I am at present wholly ignorant, I will report the result to Government; but until an administration is formed, there will be no real progress. I will therefore take up that point first. No. 1480CI., dated Baroda, 10th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. R eferring to the latter part of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General's khureeta to Your Highness' address, dated 25th ultimo, in which it is stated that ' the Resident will now convey to you under die instructions I have sent him authoritative advice in regard to several important matters affecting Your Highness' administrationmoreover ''onany occasion on which Your Highness may consult him, he will freely advice you and give you such help as he can.' 2. I have therefore the honor to forward, for Your Highness' considera tion, the following opinion expressed by His Excellency the Viceroy regarding the members of your present administration named below. It is as follows:— 'Judging from the information submitted by the Commission, His Excellency in Councif cannot hope that the necessary reforms will be effected so long as the Dewan Syajee Rao and some other officials, notably Bulwunt Rao Deo, the Revenue Commissioner Huriba Gaekwar, the Sir Fouzdar Bulwunt Rao Eshwunt, and the Deputy Revenue Commissioner Narayen BhaiJ remain in power. His Excellency in Council is therefore of opinion that His Highness would do well to remove these men from office, making for them such provision as His Highness may deem reasonable, and to appoint more suitable persons to fill the offices they hold.' 3. Should Your Highness ask for the services of British officers, European or Native, to assist you in the work of reform, endeavours will be made to meet your wishes, and to furnish Your Highness with the officers you may require, provided the conditions of their employment and the powers to be vested in them are such as Government can approve. 4. I am instructed to inform our Highness that the choice of Minister is left entirely with Your Highness, and that on this or any other occasionupon which Your Highness may do me the honor to consult me, I shall, according to my instructions, freely communicate with you orally and give you such help as I can; final written advice will be offered in each instance after it lias been approved of by His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council. No. 247-844, dated Baroda, llth August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I n continuation of my letter No. 244-840, dated yesterday, I have thc honor to report that the Maharaja has been consulting me through his Karbharees (and a few days back personally also) about the retention in office ot Mr. Dadabhai and his party. His Highness lias long wanted to part from Mr. Dadabhai himself, but he fears, as I before reported to Government, his home influence, and that he will give bim a bad name. Mr. Dadabhai, I am reliably informed, went so far a day or two ago as to draw up an agreement of 25 articles to the effect that the Maharaja was to make over the Raj to him and his party, in order to effect the reforms specified in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's khureeta of 25th ultimo. This the Maha raja was dissuaded by the old Karbharees from doing, but owing to the impression made by Mr. Dadabhai and his followers as to the weight of responsibility which the khureeta throws on His Highness, he is nearly distracted by indecision notwithstanding the assurances of help which I have given. AVhen consulted I gave my decided opinion that Mr. Dadabhai and his party had not the knowledge, ability, experiences, or weight of character sufficient to carry out the reforms needed in every department of the State; that none of the people from the Sirdar downwards had the least confidence in them; and that judging from the fair trial which Mr. Dadabhai has had for the last nine months, and Mr. Kazee Shahabudin for five, together with the results of that trial, I saw no hope of the requisite work being done by them. That 1 doubted if men of ability and character from British districts would serve under Mr. Dadabhai; and that as regards His Highness' signing an agreement to make over his Kiasut to any one whatever except the British Government, I looked upon the very proposal on Mr. Dadabhai's part as an offence against the sovereignty of the paramount power; and that if such a matter w r ere to come officially before me, I should take most serious notice of it. As might naturally be supposed Mr. Dadabhai and his friends are indignant at my having expressed such an opinion regarding them, but at the present crisis I felt bound in duty to say honestly w^hat I believed to be true, and leave it for the Maharaja to accept or not as might please bim. Several factions are now trying to make capital out of His Highness. The notorious Damodur Punt has brought a man named Bam Bhow, said to have been Karbharee of a small State in Upper India, and he hopes to have him appointed Dewan. I told His Highness that rather than work should suffer for want of a Dew r an, I would lend him my Native Assistant Mr. Munibhai to be joint karbharee with Ilao Saheb Baboobhai, who is really doing the Dew^n's work at present; so that in the event of Mr. Dadabhai going, w hich I hear he threatens to do, unless the Maharaja signs the abovementioned agreement, the duties of the Dew r an W'Ould be temporarily provided for more efficiently than they have yet been during the present reign. Knowing the difficult character of the work that has to be done, inde pendently of the amount of it, I feel sure that unless I can persuade HisHighness to introduce some first-rate hardworking men from our districts into the administration, there will he no real progress. I intimated to His Highness that he had better inform Mr. Dadahhai that I had privately expressed the opinion about not retaining him in power, and that if he came to the Residency I would give the same reasons that I have expressed above, and assure him of my unalterable conviction that he has not the qualification for Minister of a State in the thoroughly disorganized con dition that Baroda unfortunately is. No. 24?., dated Bombay, 16tli August 1874 (Confidential). From—Secretary to Govern meat of Bombay, To—Resident at Baroda. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters noted in the Ko.244-840.dated 10th August 1874, margin, reporting on the conrso of the negotiations with yad enclosed. opened by you with His Highness the Gaekwar No. 247-844, dated nth idem. ^ consequence of the instructions communicated to you in my confidential despatch No. 225, dated the 6th instant. 2. In reply, I am desired to state that the Government have no objection to offer to the yad which you addressed to the Gaekwar when communicating to him the opinion entertained by His Excellency the Viceroy with respect to certain of His Highness' old Ministers. And they would have been very glad if at this early stage of the negotiations the Gaekwar had been left without further intervention on your part to weigh well the responsibility from which in this matter he could not escape. 3. It is to be gathered from your letter No. 247 of the 11th instant that you had been consulted by the Gaekwar respecting Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee and his Assistants before you communicated to him the opinion of the Governor- General in Council regarding his old Ministers, and it is therefore greatly to be regretted that you did not observe the entire absence of all notice by the Governor-General of Mr. Dadabhai, from which it was reasonably to be infer red that the Government of India would not object to his continued employ ment if such should be the choice of the Gaekwar. 4. His Excellency in Council would not of course wish you to advocate such a course if you were conscientiously opposed to it. But the advice which you represent yourself to have given went far beyond what Avas called for at the time, and was indeed hardly to be sustained by the facts of the case. You urged that 'judging from the fair trial' that had been given to Mr. Dadabhai and Mr. Kazee Shahabudin you saw no hope of the requisite work being done by them. But it cannot with any certainty be stated that they have had a fair trial. So far as the Government are aware the men objected to by the Governor- General in Council have all the time been retained in office, and it cannot be known to what extent the efforts of Mr. Dadabhai and Mr. Kazee's may have been frustrated by them. 5. Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee himself may be fairly open to the objection of being inexperienced in matters of administration, but a very high opinion is entertained in many quarters of his character and abilities, while certainly in the case of Mr. Kazee Shahabudin there can be no lack of either abilities or experience. The Government therefore while abstaining from expressing the opinion that no better selections could be made, at the same time feel that they cannot take objection to the continued employment of these gentlemen if the Gaekwar should so decide in the free exercise of his choice. 6. In conclusion, I am to impress upon you, especially at the early stage of these negotiations, the extreme importance of your abstaining without 44previous communication with the Government from gmng advice to the Durbar which may go beyond the instructions you may have from time to time received.

No. 1502C.7, dated Baroda, 12th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. R eferring to those portions of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General's khureeta of the 25th July last, which dwell upon the geographical position of the Baroda State intermixed with British territory, the maintenance of a subsidiary force for the enforcement of i'our Highness' legitimate authority. Your Highness' obligations to your subjects of substantial justice 46.47 Z4 being done to them, life and property being protected, and the general welfare of the people and country not bein^ neglected, I am, in continuation of yad No. 1486C.6, to bring under Your Highness' consideration, and for free communication with myself prior to the adoption of final authoritative advice on the part of the British Government, the subject of the grievances of the Sirdars and Military classes of the State as set forth in paragraph 8, group 1, of the Earoda Commission Report, and other parts of those proceedings, vide marginal note No. 1 to paragraph 9, and marginal note paragraph 12, &amp;c., &amp;c. Amongst the general instructions given for my guidance by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India is the following, which,I think it expedient to bring to Your Highness' notice as applicable not only to this group of cases, but to all the recommendations of the Commission :— 'Irrespective, however, of any request on the pprt of the Gaekwar for advice, the Resident should call upon His Highness to effect a thorough and lasting reform of his Government in those matters in which the Commission have shown that the administration calls for reform, and urge him to conform to the recommendations made by the Commission.' In addition, moreover, to the subject specified in paragraph 1 above, and with regard to the future, I am to invite Your Highness, in consultation with me, to frame such general rules for adoption in giving effect to reduction of Sirdars and Silladars as will ensure their being carried out with due consider ation to the claims of the parties concerned, and will prevent the scandal and risk that must attend the sudden deprivation, without compensation or other provision of any sort, of large numbers of old or hereditary military servants of the service on which they are wholly dependant for the means of subsistence. _ _ These rules when framed will be submitted to the Bombay Government for approval, after which authoritative advice will be offered to Your Highness regarding them. — No. 1503C.8, dated Baroda, 12th August 1874.

From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to Government of Bombay. I n continuation of my letter No. 260-864, dated 14th instant, I have the honor herewith to forward copies of the following yads this day addressed to the Durbar, Nos. 1532C.10, 1533C.11, and 15340.12. No. 1532C.10, dated Baroda, 17th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. T he next subject to which I am to invite Your Highness' serious attention for settlement, according to equity and reason in connection with the khureeta of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of the 25th ultimo, and the proceedings of the Baroda Commission, are the grievances of the late Gaekwar's family, and of the followers and the servants of the late Chief, as set forth in paragraph 8, groups 11 and 12, and paragraph 12, page 9, and cases 42 and 45 to 56 of the Report. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General is of opinion that Your Highness would do well to extend to the relatives and dependants of the late Chief the justice and consideration due to them, and that as regards the future, Your Highness should desist from all harsh and vindictive treatment towards them. No. 1533C.11, dated Baroda, 17th August 1874. Trom—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. T he next subject upon which I am instructed to invite the serious atten tion of Your Highness with a view to settlement, according to equity and reason, and further authoritative advice being ultimately offered regarding it should such be necessary, is that Your Highness should make suitable provision for all the immediate members of the Gaekwar family, and permit the ladies to reside away from Baroda, should sucU appear to be desirable, their allowances should be fixed with the approval of the Government of Bombay, and they can be paid according to lists to be furnished by the Gaekwar, the money being recovered from the Baroda State. No. 1534C.12, dated Baroda, 17th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. T he next subject which I am to bring under Your Highness' consideration in connection with His Excelleney the Viceroy's khureeta of the 25th ultimo, and the proceedings of the Baroda Commission, is that Your Highness will be 48pleased to issu- 1 a proclamation prohibiting the infliction of corporal punish ment upon women, and absolutely interdicting under severe penalties the personal ill-treatment in this or any other way of females whether in Jail, or before the Courts, or under examination by the Police, and that a copy of such proclama tion be forwarded for the information of Government. No. 255-857, dated Baroda, 13th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombav r , I n continuation of my letter No. 247-844, dated 11th instant, I have the honor to submit that, in a demi-official letter to the address of His Excellencv the Governor, dated 5th May last, I spoke of the contingency of Nana Sahib Khanvelker being deprived of the office of Minister, and reverting to his appointment as Sir Soobah. Accordingly after His Excellency the Vicerov and Governor-General's advice regarding certain Durbar officials hid been communi cated by me to the Gaekwar on the 10th instant. Nana Sahib came to consult me as to his future prospects. I told him that he was the Sir Soobah of the 1. Resident's letter No. 250A., dated 24th December 1873. Contingent, and that he WOUld be 2.

Resident's letter No. 24-98, dated 30th January 1874. aS SUCll. He then asked me whether 5. Resident's letter No. 19-85, dated 23rd January 1874. hf OOllh] not V ia l i 6. Government letter No. 618, dated 6th February 1874. V, .,.•!/. n0t . ^ acknowledged as 1 utmidlii, vide correspondence as . s 0 P? r margin; and I distinctly told ' . ^' m ''at he could not with* the sanction of Government in the face of His Excellency the Vicerov and Governor General's expressed opinion. He then said that he 'had no wish to interfere in public matters, but that his duties as Pritinidhi would onlv be of a ceremonial character at Durbars, and to give him rank. I distinctly told him that his t s. o. request was impossible withf the consent of Gov- ernment, and that he must be content to remain as Sir boobah. Before leaving he expressed his intention of livin' the greater part ol the year at the several Contingent head-quarters of Deesa Manekwarra, and Sadra. I replied that the plan was a good one. 2. Next day (11th instant) the several persons recommended to be re moved from their appointments ceased to perform their usual functions L.rt the negotiations went on with Mr. Dadabhai and his party, the result of'their consultations being that last night the Maharaja resolved to retain Mr. Dadabhii ~ s ^?, e , war1 ' sent Rao Sahib JJapoobhai to me to press me in regard to Nm-i Sahib s appointment as Pritinidhi. Bapoobhai said that as yet the usual voshack or dross ot honor, had not been conferred on Nana Sahib, because His Highness had been waiting for a recognition of his appointment by the British Govern- ment. He added that the Maharaja had been on the eve of grantin'- him the poshack at 4 p.m . yesterday at Mr. Dadabhai's suggestion I presume'indeneml ently ot me; but that Bapoobhai had stopped the ceremonv pending another reference to me. I again repeated that the act of promoting Nana Sahib to a higher office than that from which he had been displaced on the advice of His Excellency the \ iceroy and Governor-General, which they professed to resnwf and obey, would be a direct mark of disrespect to His Excellencv the Vicerov and that it would be regarded as such. Bapoobhai then argued that the Main' raja was left to do as he pleased, and why this restriction about the appointment ot Prjtmidhi ? I replied that the Maharaja might do as he pleased, but that if be did this, as contemplated, I should write a yad to the effect that I considered it to have a nullifying effect upon His Excellency the Viceroy's advice, and that 1 should according to my instructions 'not insist upon my advice hei,,,, f„l owed but that I should simply inform His Highness ^hat ^e is sdfl to act on his judgment, but that a note has been taken of bis inattention 49 1350 to the advice given.' Bapoobliai then asked me why I could not allow the installation and appointment privately, and communicate privately about it with Government at some future date. I replied that I had only one course to pursue, that whether privately or publicly conducted the act would be one of distinct disrespect to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, and therefore that I would have nothing whatever to do with it. 3. This morning on His Highness paying me his usual visit with Eao Sahib Bapoobhai he resumed the matter, and pleaded precisely as he did at Resident's letter No. i4i-756 ( dated this time last year, viz., that ' Nana Sahib was his isth August 1873, pam. relative, and that his dishonor was his own,' &amp;c., and entreated me to recognize Nana Sahib as Pritinidhi privately, that his duties would be merely ceremonial at Durbars, and nothing else, and that it was only to save his honor in the sight of the people that he made the request. He said that Eapoobhai would speak to me privately about it, but I replied that the thing was impossible in the face of the advice I had been ordered to give him. Moreover, I reminded His Highness that a Pritinidhi was to all intents and purposes the deputy of the sovereign, and in his absence from any cause would become Regent by virtue of his office. 4. After His Highness left, Bapoobhai and Govindrao Mama repeated the same arguments as before, and I told them that it was no use for them to write yads ostensibly, consenting to the advice offered, whilst secretly they were doing all in their power to nullify and thwart that advice. That if this was the kind of reform His Highness was going to carry out under Mr. Dadabhai's administration, it could only end in one result, and that very shortly. They said that the Maharaja did not wish to retain Mr. Dadabhai, and that if the British Government would advise him to that effect he would dismiss him. I replied thdt the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy were distinctly that His Highness was to choose his own Minister, and that the choice accordingly must rest with him ; that I had openly given him my opinion of Mr. Dadabhai when asked, coupled with a repetition of the above order, and, therefore, that as the Maharaja had distinctly asked to be allowed to appoint his own Minister, his request had been granted. I, moreover, pointed out that when I gave this opinion of Mr. Dada bhai, I showed how the Government could be carried on provisionally pending the selection by His Highness of an able man, but that my advice had been rejected, and there the matter must rest. 5. Every one, including the Maharaja himself, and excepting only the Dadabhai party, acknowledge that in the offer I made of lending them my Assistant to act as a kharbharee jointly with their own Durbar, I consulted their real interests and opened the way for a satisfactory solution of the many heavy cases on hand, at the risk of considerable inconvenience to myself; and at last Bapoobhai himself remarked that everything appeared to have been turned upside down, that he, who was recommended by the Commission, has been rejected, and that Nana Sahib who has been rejected was to have promotion. . 6. I have not received the official yad yet regarding the arrangements for the proposed administration, but when I do, it shall be forwarded with my remarks. No. 259-863, dated Baroda, 14th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to Government of Bombay, Political Department. I n continuation of my letter No. 255-857, dated yesterday, I have the honor to forward, for the information of Government, Durbar reply No. 1434 oi this date to my yad No. 1480C.1., copy of which is already with Govern ment.51 2. It will be observed that under Mr. Uadabhai Nowrojee's advice His Iliglmess has not commenced the fulfillment of his promises of reform well, he in the first instance having addressed me in terms never before used towards the Resident; and in the next having plainly shown that he does not wish me to give him any advice by saying that when it is wanted it will be asked for. 3. ^ The first of these manoeuvres is meant to express their indignation at my having withstood their unreasonable request in regard to Nana Sahib's appointment of Pritinidhi. The second is put forward in order as far as pos sible to prevent my seeing real reforms carried out and the orders of Govern ment respected. 4. I knew beforehand, from information received, that every effort would be put forward to avoid receiving any advice from me at all, hence I was not unprepared for the announcement made in the last paragraph of the Durbar yad, No. 1434 of this date, and therefore in most of the vads sent to the Durbar on the subject of Government letter No. 22P., dated 6th instant, and especially in my yad &gt;10. 1502C.7., I was careful to explain what my intentions were regarding my own advice as Resident, as distinct from the authoritative advice of Government; in some cases ordered to be given at once, and in other after consultation with me. 5. I have explained this distinction orally to His Iliglmess, as well as his Karbharees, on several occasions, therefore I entertain no doubt that the announcement made at the end of the yad herewith forwarded is intended to thwart my efiorts as far as possible, and unless corrected at once it could not fail in course of time to nullify the hona Jide intentions of Government altogether. 6. The original yad to which I object, as well as a translation of it, together with my reply, accompany this letter for the information of Government. 7. In order, moreover, to shew how unsatisfactory the state of affairs still is at Baroda, I beg to state that even yesterday evening an occurrence took place in the open street in the city which has created a great scandal; and in which the Maharaja himself. Nana Sahib, and the notorious Damoodur Punt were en gaged. Rao Sahib Bapoobhai and Govindrao Mama spoke to me about it this morning, and asked my opinion, which I of course said I could not give unless I heard both sides of the case. Numbers of people were present; the altercation which lasted for more than half an hour was between the Maharaja and one of his Sirdars about the batter's wife, the daughter of the late Gunputrao Maharaj. The lady it appears is suspected of being on friendly terms with the Maharaja, and the latter drove up to the Sirdar's house and sent for her. She came down into the street and began to talk with the Maharaja. Her husband who was in the house, eating his dinner at the time, on being told what was going on, came down into the street, and by this time a lar^e con course of people had assembled, before whom the altercation took place. 3 I find that this Sirdar, whose name is Anandrao Wishwasrao, alias Nana Sahib Powar, complained to me a year ago about his domestic affairs, and that I did not move in them under the hope that some general settlement would take place. 8. I submit respectfully that the actual occurrences of even the last day or two tend to confirm the suspieion I often entertain that His Highness cannot possibly be in his proper senses, or that he has lost all moral sense of right and wrong, and is not responsible for his actions. 9. The enclosed yad, however, is the work of Mr. Dadabhoy and his followers, who are responsible for it as well as the Maharaja. Translation of Durbar Yad, No. 1434, dated 14th August 1874. W ith reference to Residency Yad No. 1480 C. 1., dated 10th August 1874, I have the honor to state that agreeably to the advice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General the following has been done :— You* are aware that Azum Sivajirow was nominal Dewan for carry- • Note.—it is worthy of note that in ^ 011 communication with you.* From the ' Tooin' is used in speaking of )ne, and tilllC that tllC Residency yad. No. 2729 of Azuin in speaking of Nana Sahib. was ^ ^ ^ ^ducted by Azum Dadablioy Nowrojee, and the responsibility rested on him. Having told Rajashree Sivajirovv agreeably to the advice of His Excel lency the Governor-General, he has resigned the office of Dewan ; and agreeably to the recommendation of His Excellency suitable arrangement will be made lor him. 'When Hajashree Bala Mungesh Wagla was appointed Nyayadish (Judge) of the Warisbt Court he was made responsible not only for all ordinary duties but for looking personally into every case. Bulwuntrow Deo was doing slight work connected with the Court. Being told agreeably to the advice of His Excellency, he has resigned his post. Since Kazi Shahab-ood-deen's appointment as Joint Sirsoobha he has been responsible Tor the greater part of the duties appertaining to that department. Rajashree Haribar Gaekwar only looked after slight business. Being told agree ably to the advice of His Excellency, he has resigned his office and Sirsooba. The same about Narayenbhai. Since Hormusjee Wadia's appointment to the Fouzdaree Department Bul- wuntrow Yeshwunt looked after slight judicial work. Being warned agreeably to the advice of His Excellency, he has resigned his office in the Eouzdaree Department. Agreeably to the advice of His Excellency, suitable provision will be made for the said four Kamdars in accordance with the wish of this Government. The British Government has expressed its willingness to lend the assistance of British officials in the work of reform, for which I beg to thank them. A separate yad will be sent as regards my availing myself of the offer wirh pleasure. A separate yad will be sent about my Dewan. You write to say that when I have occasion to obtain your advice you will freely give it, and help me as far as you can ; for this I am thankful to you ; when necessity arises I will gladly avail myself of the offer. N ote .—It will be observed how particular the writer is in usuing Azum and Rajashree in speaking of the persons turned out, or supposed to be so. All this makes the contrast of Toom the more impertinent. (Sd.) II. P hayre. No. 1519, dated Baroda, 14th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. R eferring to the last paragraph of your yad No. 1434, dated 14th instant, which states that when necessity arises Your Highness will gladly avail yourself of my offer of advice, I think it right to explain, in order to avoid any misunderstanding npon the subject, that I have the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General to call upon Your Highness to effect a thorough and lasting reform of your Government in all matters in which the Commission have shown that the administration calls for reform, and I am also to urge Your Highness to conform to the recommendations made by the Commission, and that in all this I am to act irrespective of any request on the part of Your Highness for advice. This I shall accordingly do as necessity arises. It is optional with Your Highness to accept such advice or not, and to act on your own judgment, nevertheless the advice has to be offered; and if not accepted, I have instructions of Government to inform Your Highness regarding each instance separately, that a note has been taken of your inattention to the advice given. I observe at the commencement of the yad under reply that Your High ness twice uses the word ' Toom ' in connection with me personally. I would therefore bring to It our Highness' notice that this style of addressing the 52M- British representative at your Court is wanting in proper respect, not only to me personally, but also to the Government which I represent; moreover that, it is altogether unprecedented in Durbar communications to the Resident up to * this day. I have therefore the honor to request that Your Highness will be pleased to substitute a properly worded yad in the part objected to for the one under reply, and forward it to me for record as soon as convenient. It does not escape my observation that towards the close of the yad under reply the proper mode of address ' ass ' is used, which makes the use of the word ' toom ' twice at the beginning of the yad the more marked, I hope therefore that Your Highness will make the alteration suggested above. No. 260-864, dated Bavoda Residency, 14th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I n continuation of my letter No. 259-863, dated 14th instant, I have the honor herewith to forward a copy of the yad this day addressed to the Durbar, No. 1518C.9. No. 1518C.9, dated 14th August 1874. Prom—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. T he next subject which I am to bring under Your Highness' consideration for thorough and lasting reform is that Your Highness will be pleased to put a stop to and severely punish any person concerned in the abduction of women for forced service in the Palace, in respect to which the Commission record that 'several cases of the description stated have undoubtedly occurred involving an abuse of power on the part of the Maharaja, and oppression by certain inferior Durbar officials and servants, which have brought a most serious scandal on the personal character of the Chief himself, and the administration of which he is the head.' No. 26P., dated Poona, 24th August 1874 (confidential). From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Resident at Baroda. W ith reference to your yad to His Highness the Gaekwar, No. 1533 of 17th August last, calling on him ' to make suitable provision for all the immediate members of the Gaekwar family, and to permit the ladies to reside away from Baroda, &amp;c.,' I am directed to request that you will explain your apparent disregard of the instructions contained in the last paragraph of my letter No. 221^. of 6th instant, to the effect that, except in the case of Her Highness Bukmabaee, no ' communication should be made to the Gaekwar or to ^ the Durbar about any other lady without previous consultation with Government.' No. 261-865, dated Baroda, 15th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. I n submitting the accompanying translation of Durbar yad No. 1455, dated yesterday, requesting that the usual military honors due to the Dewan 53 14of the Baroda State may be paid to Mr. Badabhai Nowrojee, I have the honor to submit that, coDsidering our experience of Mr. Dadabhai's connection with the Baroda State since the close of the year 1872, and his invariable line of conduct towards the British Government, we should, I think, be incurring a very grave responsibility were we formally to recognize Mr. Dadabhai as Dewan, thereby virtually approving the Gaekwar's selection of him and his party to carry out a work of reform, which we have reason to believe from the events of the past 8 or 9 months they are entirely incapable of effecting. 2. I have already shown at various times since April 1873 that Mr. Dadabhai w T cis the principal adviser of the present Gaekwar at the close of 1872, when his contumacious conduct in refusing to attend His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-Generars Durbar in Bombay elicited the displeasure of the Bombay Government, an example like that being set by one of the principal Native Princes in India, no doubt had a very bad political effect at the time, and is still remembered by many ; and there can also be no doubt from what has since occurred at Baroda, that it has exercised a baneful effect upon the character of Mulhar Bao Gaekwar ever since. 3. Subsequent to that Mr. Dadabhai wrote the precedence khureeta for His Highness, and under various pretences persuaded the week-minded Mulhar Rao to appoint him his Agent in England to conduct that and other imaginary cases of grievance, and it should be especially noted that whilst Mr. Dadabhai was at Baroda at that period, he was both openly and secretly aided in his designs by the then Parsee head clerk of the Baroda Besidency Office establishment. 4. Having secured Rupees 50,000 from the Gaekwar for these supposed good services, Mr. Dadabhai went to England in about April 1873, but returned to Baroda in the following December, and has been here ever since. 5.

G. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's khureeta of the 25th ultimo was delivered by me to His Highness on the 3rd instant, but instead of a change for the better manifesting itself, one of the first efforts of Mr. Dadabhai and his party was to turn the advice contained therein to their own account by endeavouring to induce the Gaekwar to sign an agreement to the general ellect that the administration should be placed in their hands for a certain period. This I am given to understand the Maharaja declined to do, upon which Mr. Dadabhai and his party threatened to leave Baroda. I was then consulted as to the advisability of retaining Mr. Dadabhai in power, and I at once replied that he ought to be allowed to depart. 1 at the same time pointed out how a good X )rovisional Government could be organized, pending 5455 ^ *0* - ' &gt; the selection by His Iliglmess of a suitable Minister. Dadabbai upon this took into his counsels the notorious Damodur Punth, the present favorite of the Gaekwar, the panderer to his grossest vices, the oppressor of women, &amp;c., and the unfortunate result has been that the Maharaja decided in favor of Mr. Dadabhai and his party. 7. On the 10th instant I commenced giving the authoritative advice of His Excellency the 'Viceroy and Governor-General as conveyed in my yad No. CI, advising that the Dewan Nana Sahib, &amp;c., should be removed from employment. 8. Scarcely had this advice been given to His Highness than I was pressed No. 255-857, dated isth August as already reported in my letter as per margin to 1874. permit Nana Sahib, the Ex-Dewan, to receive the honors due to a Pritinidhi. The request itself being insulting to the British Government as evincing a deliberate desire to promote the man to greater honor than His Excellency the A r iueroy had advised his being deprived of, and this too whilst the impression as first made by the khureeta was still fresh. 9. Having been foiled in this manoeuvre, Mr. Dadabhai commenced his correspondence with me in the ynd No. 1434), which I forwarded to Government yesterday, with my report of the same date, wherein it has been shown how Mr. Dadabhai followed up his system of insulting the Resident, and endeavoring to rid himself and his master of his advice in all matters connected with the thorough and lasting reform which has to be carried out. 10. Such being briefly our experience of Mr. Dadabhai's measures as an administrator even since the receipt of His Excellency the Viceroy's khureeta; I respectfully submit that, so far from our being able to confer military honors upon him, and recommend his continued employment by the Gaekwar, it would be absolutely subversive of our own proposals for reform, our own interests, as well as our own honor and dignity, were we to do so in the face of the actual facts on record; on the contrary we are bound, I submit, to caution His Highness that a man who has proved himself hitherto to be so bad an adviser, and so utterly devoid of all weight in the State, cannot possibly initiate or carry out that thorough and lasting reform upon which the present Gaekwar has been solemnly assured that his tenure of sovereign power depends. v A Translation of Durbar yad, No. 1435, dated 14th August 1874. Azum Dadabhai Nowrojee has my full confidence, and is a worthy man. A yad No. 2729, dated 23rd December 1873, was sent to the Residency, to the effect that he had been appointed to the duties of Dewan, and he has been doing work accordingly. Kindly therefore arrange that he may get the custom ary military honors, &amp;c., due to the Dewan, and send an answer. No. 25P., dated Poona, 24th August 1874 (Confidential). From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Resident at Baroda. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt from you of the following com munications :— I.—Letters Nos. 252 and 254 of the 12th instant, and 264 of the 17th instant, forwarding copies of 10 yads containing advice on various matters addressed by you to the Gaekwar. II.—Letter No. 255 of 13th instant, reporting that the officials objected to by the Government of India had ceased to perform their functions, but that the Gaekwar desired that Nana Sahib Khanvelkur should be confirmed in theoffice of Pritinidlii with merely ceremonial duties attached ; that you had in formed the Gaekwar and H. S. Bapoohhai and N. S. Khanvelkur himself, that such an arrangement was impossible in the face of the advice you had been ordered to give. III.—Letter No. 259 of 14th instant, forwarding yad from the Gaekwar of the same date, in which he states that the officials objected to had resigned their offices, and acknowledges with thanks the offer of the services of British officers and of your own advice, animadverting on the use of the expression ' toom' as addressed to yourself, and on the terms on which the Gaekwar accepts your offer of advice. And forwarding copy of your answer to the Gaekwar's yad of the same date, in which you intimate that you are ordered to offer advice on certain points whether applied for or not, and request the Gaekwar to substitute a new yad with the rectification of the expression objected to. IV.—Letter No. 260 of 14th instant, with copy of yad advising the Gaekwar to put a stop to the abduction of women. V.—Letter No. 261 of 15th instant, forwarding the Gaekwar's official request that the customary military honors may be paid to the Dewan, Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, and giving your reasons for considering that this should be refused, and all other recognition of Mr. Dadabhai's appointment. 2. I am now to communicate to you the observations of Government on your proceedings as reported in these papers. 3. The prompt manner in which the Gaekwar caused the officers objected to to resign their offices deserved recognition, and His Excellency in Council cannot but regret the strong terms in which you objected to his very natural wish to break the fall of one of them, his brother-in-law. Nana Sahib Khanvelkur, to whom he has always shewn much attachment, by conferring on him the honorary title of Pritinidhee, without, as he positively assured you, entrusting to him any administrative functions. Such an arrangement, if really carried out, would not be contrary to the spirit of the advice given by the Government of India, and it would have been sufficient if you had confined your opposition to impressing on the Gaekwar the dangerous results that would ensue to himself, if, in violation of his pledges, he permitted Nana Sahib Khanvelkur to become the instrument of further misgovernment. It will still be w T ell for you to take an opportunity of making an intimation to the Gaekwar that the Government will not object to his conferring this honorary title, although they cannot authorise any greater honor being in, consequence paid to Nana Sahib Klianvelkur than those to which he may now be entitled as Sir Soobah. 4. Referring to the Gaekwar's yad of the 14th instant, the use of the word ' toom' as addressed to you was undoubtedly disrespectful, and His Excellency in Council desires to know the result of your request to the Gaekwar tor its rectification. But the objection taken by you to the con cluding sentence ot the yad, in which the Gaekwar courteously acknoAvledo-es your offer of advice, and promises to apply for it on necessity arising, wasfin the opinion of Government, most unreasonable. It is difficult to ^see what other answer the Gaekwar could have been expected to give, and your rejoinder, that in many matters he would have to listen to your advice, whether he requested it or not, of which he had been already informed in sufficiently per emptory terms, was uncalled for. 5.^ The report of your opposition to the appointment of Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee as Dewan, as expressed by you to the Gaekwar and some of his oflicers, and your protest to Government against according to him the military honors customarily paid to the Dewan, and in fact any recognition whatever on the part of Government have been read by His Excellency in Council with the greatest surprise. You have been made acquainted in the clearest lan'■uan-e with the determination of Government not to fetter the Gaekwar in the choice 56of his Minister, but to look only to the results of his choice. Wholly ignoring these instructions, you have placed yourself in a position ot such decided hostility to the Dewan, whom the Gaekwar has appointed, as to impede most seriously the cordial co-operation of the Minister and yourself, in carrying out the administrative reforms which it is the sole object of the Government to induce His Highness to effect. 6. The Government are fully sensible of the distinction between the authoritative advice which you are directed to give in certain matters, and the friendly advice which you are to give in the matters about which the Gaekwar may consult you. And it has not escaped observation that the Gaekwar consulted you on the expediency of appointing Mr. Dadabhoy as his Dewan. But His Excellency in Council cannot admit that you can divest yourself of your public character in your friendly any more than in your authoritative com- , munications; and you were bound to say nothing under the former head which would be in any way contrary to the spirit of your instructions. The expression of your determined personal opposition to Mr. Dadabhoy was, in the opinion of His Excellency in Council, inconsistent with the order that the Gaekwar should be left free to appoint his own Minister besides being injudicious in view of the possibility that Mr. Dadabhoy might be appointed in spite of your advice. I am also to notice as injudicious your observation to R. S. Bapoobhai and Govindrao Mama reported in paragraph 4 of your letter No. 255 of 13th August. ' That if this was the kind of reform His Highness was going to carry out under Mr. Dadabhoy's administration, it could end only in one result, and that very shortly.' 7. His Excellency in Council is much concerned to find in these trans actions a most serious misappreciation of the actual position of affairs, and of the line of conduct you have been ordered by the Government of India and this Government to pursue. 8. In order that the false steps you have taken may be retraced, I am directed to request that you will, on returning to Baroda, inform the Gaekwar in writing, and without comment, that you have been personally consulted by His Excellency in Council on the present situation, that His Excellency desires to acknowledge the promptness with which His Highness has attended to the advice of the Government of India in the matter of removing certain officials from office, and that the Government, while refraining from pronouncing any opinion on the gratifications of Mr. Dadabhoy, desire to offer no objection whatever to his appointment as Dewan, if the Gaekwar in the exercise of his independent discretion should think proper to appoint him, and you should add that you will afford him every assistance he may need, and accord to him the usual military honors. 9. You will be good enough to forward, for the information of Govern ment, a copy of the yad by which you w r ill communicate to the Durbar the instructions now given respecting the recognition of Mr. Dadabhoy as Dewan. 10. His Excellency in Council much regrets, being compelled by an im perative sense of duty, to address to you this communication, which he feels cannot but be painful to you. And it will afford him much gratification to find himself enabled to give you cordial support in the future conduct of the difficult task you have before you. No. 261A. dated Baroda, 2Sth August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I n acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 25P., dated 24th instant, I have the honor to express my deep regret that I have unwillingly incurred the displeasure of His Excellency the Governor in Council on the alleged grounds of having taken two false steps; one in the matter of Nana Sahib's 57 15appointment as Pritinidhi of the Gaekwar State, and the other in regard to the Opinion I expressed when consulted by i[is Highness the Gaekwar as to the advisability or otherwise of his retaining the services of Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee as Minister. 2. I trust to be able to offer sueh explanation of my conduct and advice in regard to these questions as shall-remove the strong dissatisfaction which has been expressed by Government in your letter under reply. 3. With regard to the question of Nana Sahib's appointment as Pritinidhi there were two points at issue:— 1^.—Whether, taking into consideration Nana Sahib's recent removal for misconduct from the office of Dewan at the instance of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, we could recognize him in the higher appoint ment of Pritinidhi, even though the duties of that office were made purely ' ceremonial as promised by the Gaekwar. 2Whether, as such recognition on our part consists only in the grant of military honors, superior, or at all events equal, to those granted to the Dewan of the Baroda State, we could consistently accord to Nana Sahib such honors, he having just been deprived of them on his removal from the office of Dewan. 4. The decision of Government upon these points is— 16^.—That the Government will not object to His Highness the Gaekwar conferring the honorary title of Pritinidhi upon Nana Sahib, provided the functions of the appointment are merely ceremonial and not of an adminis trative character. ^ndly. —That the Government cannot authorize any greater military honors being paid to Nana Sahib in consequence of his honorary appointment of Priti nidhi. 5. Thus with regard to both points the decision of Government confirms my original suggestion, that we could not recognize even the ceremonial appoint ment in the manner that the Gaekwar wanted, mz., by military honors. iUl else it was in the Gaekwar's own power to give without reference to us, and therefore his sole object in asking us was to obtain that which the Government have found it impossible to grant. G. I respectfully claim therefore, under this explanation, to be exonerated from the charge of having taken a false step in this matter. 7. W ith regard to the expediency of our intimating to His Highness the Gaekwar that we have no objection to his appointing Nana Sahib Honorary Pritinidhi on the terms stated under present circumstances, I respectfully submit that time alone can show whether the effect of promoting Nana Sahib to a higher rank in the State than he held before will be good or bad ; and that with^the orders and facts which I had for my guidance, I am not open to blame as hav ing taken a false step in opposing that measure when first proposed to me. 8. His Highness the Gaekwar paid me his usual visit last evening, and I communicated to him the Government order on this subject. He was very much pleased indeed with the Government intimation, that the objection to his appoint ing Nana Sahib to perform the ceremonial duties of Pritinidhi was withdrawn; but instead of being contented with that concession. His Highness repeated with great importunity his request that I would give the military honor due to the ofhee 'privately, as the honorary appointment was of little avail without them. He also as encouraged to repeat his request, made some time ago, that I would grant the military honors of a Ilanee to Luxmeebaee. 9. I foel sure that the Government taking into consideration the whole of the circumstances stated, in conjunction with the difficulty of mv position here, will do me justice in this matter. ' 5810. Again with regard to the appointment of Minister. The Gaekwar up to this day lias not finally confirmed Mr. Dadabhoy as such by conferring on him the usual P oshack or dress of honor; that ceremony having been post poned pending the sanction of military honors for Mr. Dadabhoy, which^vas submitted to Government so far back as the 24th December last in my letter No. 250A. Latterly, however, His Highness has been very undecided about retaining Mr. Dadabhoy as his Minister. He was directed in His Excellency the Viceroy's khureeta, dated the 25th ultimo, to seek the Resident's advice whenever lie required it, and in paragraph 7 of the Government of India letter No. 158GP. of the same date, the llesident was ordered to grant his advice and help to the Gaekwar, should it be sought in any matter connected with the administration. 11. AV hen, therefore, I was consulted by the Gaekwar regarding Mr. Da,dabhoy, I felt it to be my imperative duty to furnish His Highness with an opinion according to the best of my ability, reminding him at the same time of his entire independence in the matter; and in thus obeying 'the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, I deferentially submit that I have not taken a false step, but on the contrary have openly and honorably aided the Gaekwar by my advice when His Highness was in a state of painful suspense and indecision greatly needing it, and that had I withheld it he might justly have complained of my conduct as he no doubt would have done. 12. The opinion that I offered was purely official; it was based upon official evidence which 1 have already quoted, evidence which appears to me to show beyond a doubt that Mr. Dadahhai has from his arrival in Baroda in December last,' not only called in question the justice of appointing a Commis sion to enquire into Baroda affairs, but has systematically ignored their recom mendations in many ways during a period of eight months; consequently I failed to see how that gentleman could reasonably be expected to carry out the thorough and lasting reform based upon the recommendations of the Commis sion which His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General has enjoined. 13. I respectfully submit that this expression of opinion cannot possibly prejudice the ultimate settlement of the questions at issue one way or other; because independently of it an unquestionable array of facts will present them selves in a few months, showing whether the requisite reforms and the recom mendations of the Commission are really in course of being effected or not, and on those facts, and those alone, not on any mere opinion of mine, the ultimate verdict of Government will mainly depend. 14. Agreeably to the instructions conveyed in the 8th paragraph of your letter under reply, I have the honor to forward a copy of the letter which I addressed yesterday to the Durbar regarding Mr. Dadabiiai, that gentleman has attended at the Residency for the transaction of business both yesterdav and to-day; and I have assured him of my cordial support ' in effecting a thorough and lasting reform in these matters in which the Commission have shown that the Administration calls for reform,' to which Mr. Dadabhai replied that he felt satisfied that I would do so. 15. Referring to paragraph 4 of your letter under reply, an amended vad containing the alterations suggested by me has been received, and that matter has thus been satisfactorily settled. No. 1612, dated Baroda, 27tli August 1871. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar. Having been consulted by His Excellency the Governor in Council regard ing the present situation of affairs at Baroda, His Excellency has desired me to acknowledge the promptness with which Your Highness has attended to the advice of the Government of India in the matter of removing certain officials 59 s60 from office, and with reference to Your Highness' yad No. 1435, dated the 14th instant, I am instructed to say that the Government, while refraining from pro- nounciu'- any opinion on the qualifications of Mr. Dadahhai Nowrojee, desired to offer no objection whatever to that gentleman's appointment as Dewan, should Your Highness in the exercise of your independent discretion think proper to appoint him. It will he my duty to afford Mr. Dadahhai every assistance he may need and accord to him the usual military honors. No. 271-922, dated Baroda, 31st August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. R eferring to paragraph 6' of your confidential letter No. 22P., dated the 6th instant, I have the honor to report, for the information of His Excellency in Council, that the only points upon which I have not as yet made any com munications to the Durbar are Nos. 2 and-4 of your list, the former lefcning to the case of the Thakoors of Beejapoor, and the latter to the question of acces sion nuzzerana. 2. I think it right to state, with reference to the Beejapoor Thakoors, that they resisted the payment of an accession nuzzerana, mainly owing to their giras claims not having been settled, and I have reason to believe that befoie set tling the Ghasdana or any other claims of these men, the Durbar will insist upon their paving the accession nuzzerana which I have every reason to believe the Thakoors will resist. Moreover I am aware that the payment of the balance of the accession nuzzerana still remaining unpaid in other mahuls is being strongly pressed by the Durbar at the present moment, and is causing giCtit dis satisfaction. 3. It was only yesterday that in consequence of a border dispute between one of these Thakoors and a Mahee Kanta Thakoor No. 1613, dated 29th August. ^ Deyrole, that I was obliged to address a yad to Commission Report paragraph 8, Durbar, of which tllC accompanying is a COpV, ich U edu^ , ii.f ,AFPendixA ca8e N0 ' 2, and although this border case has nothing to do also with those which were investigated by the Commis- Appendix G., case No. 2 Schedule ii., . references in the margin, yet I feel sure containing the reply of the Durbar and SlOU, itilc i i -i i.* ^ final statement of the Resident. that it will bring OU tllC whole qUCSUOn 01 t llC Thakoor's grievances, not one of which has been redressed though promised by the Durbar, and hence my desire that Government should be informed ot the matter beforehand. 4. The Ghantoo Thakoor's conduct of a few days since in entering Mahee Kanta territory appears to me to demand that he should be given up tor trial by Major LeGeyt on the production of a satisfactory prima facie case, but apprehend that the Durbar will have to use force in order to arrest him, and such of his followers as fired on the Deyrole Thakoor and slightly wounded two persons, unless care is taken to explain to the whole of the Thakoors that an equitable settlement of their accounts generally is intended. 5. Should the Durbar apply to me for advice how to act, and ask for the aid of the subsidiary ftrce, which I know they are disposed to do, I propose to inform them that they must use their local Police and infantry and horse to maintain their authority, because it is only whon they are unable to assert that authority with the ordinary means at their disposal that the subsidiary force can properly be called upon to interfere. 6. I merely draw attention to these circumstances in consequence of the border affray now reported having precipitated the Beejapoor lliakoor s question■ generally, though, so far as I am aware, the Ghantoo Thakoor and his followers were alone implicated in the Deyrole business. P.S. Since writing the above I have heard that in the Kurree and Patton ergunnas unduly severe measures are being taken to collect the arrears of the guddee nuzzerana or accession tax; and, with reference thereto, to solicit early orders about advising His Highness the Gaekwar not to levy accession nuzzerana where there is a fixed land settlement. No. 1613, dated Baroda, 29th August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Ilig-hness the Gaekwar of Baroda. I n December 1872 theBoundary Commissioner, Lieutenant Staee, decided a long standing boundary dispute between Ghantoo in Your HWiness' BeeK poor I ergunna and Deyrole in the Subur Kanta Talooka of the Mahee Kanta 11 *i 2 ' ,, TT IT i S '!' leSS ' K am&lt; lar accompanied Lieutenant Staceat the time and all the details of the settlement are known to the Durbar: Lieutenant Stacp's decision being that the river Sobumute being the true boundary be'tween the ■vi ages of Ghantoo and Deyrole, and that the whole of the disputed land on the Deyrole ^ ^ that ia the bed of the river helonged to n87 o{ t ' le Residency records that in February last year fl873) the lhakoor of Ghantoo, disregarding this settlement, went to cultivate the disputed land which had been given over to Deyrole, and committed some No. 1613, dated 29th August. damage, as brought to the notice of the Durbar in i . , Residency yad No. 499, dated 4th March 1873 and subsequent correspondence with the Durbar. ' 4. From this correspondence, which lasted for about seven months it appeared that the Ghantoo Thakoor brought counter charges against the Xhakoor of Deyrole for having seized some cattle of his and for bavin' wounded one of his men &amp;c.; but at length the Durbar in their yad. No. 2147 dated 7th October 1873, agreed to hand over the Ghantoo Thakoor and eight other offenders to the Political Agent, Mahee Kanfte, for trial, on the strength of the prima facie cases furnished by the Political Agent, Major LeGeyt. ' A 5 ;. 0 J ^T 6 A P 1 ' il last 1 forwarded to the Durbar a copy of Political Agents yad No. 261, dated 15th April 1874, in which it was intimated that the TW f T® e ? settled between the two Thakoors and a razeenama -iven bv the Deyiole ihakoor that he was satisfied. 0 ii rn! , 14 n ? w appears, however, that notwithstanding this the lhakoor of Ghantoo again obstructed the cultivation of the land in oues tiou as brought to Your Highness' notice in Residency yad No. 1457 dated 7th instant, when I requested the Durbar to take speedv measures in t lie matter in order to prevent a recurrence of last year's obstruction. r 7. No reply to that yad has been re me, and I have now a^ain J'l i 0 ^ 1 ' fol ' ward f, ' r Your Highness' information copies of vad No ;!5'37 dated 22nd instant, and accompaniments to my address from the Political Wnt' Mahee Kanta, containing an account of further serious offences cnmmiitwi i ' the lhakoor of Ghautoo and others with him in Deyrole limits and to t ■ ''1 hat as the Ghantoo Thakoor is thus alleged to L4 be^guUty ^f uXw lully assembling an armed force for the purpose of rioting within the limits of Deyrole lalooka, Sabur Kanta, under the Mahee Kanta immedint may be taken by Your Highnes's to put a stop to 8. The prima facie case promised by Major LeGeyt will be sent to Your Highness as soon as received with a view to the surrender of the Thakoor and 61 16others, his associates in the recent alleged outrage, for trial by the Political Agent. Since writing the above I have received Durbar yad No. 1534 of this date, in which it is stated that tbe Deyrole Thakoor came and quarrelled with the Ghantoo people, and requesting that as two of the Ghantoo people had been injured by gun, shots the Deyrole people may be prevented from coming into Ghantoo limits. I shall at once despatch a copy of this yad for Major LeGeyt's information, and request him to take the necessary steps for preventing any further disturb ance of the peace pending a settlement of the case. No. 915. T rue copy* (together with copy of the Durbar yad No. 1534 of 1874, above referred to) forwarded to the Political Agent, Mahee Kanta, with reference to the correspondence endin^ with his vernacular yad No. 3537, dated 22nd instant. The Resident would feel obliged by Major LeGeyt taking such measures as he may think necessary to prevent any further collision between these parties; but if the Thakoor of Ghantoo and his people should again invade Mahee Kanta territory, they should, in the Resident's opinion, be seized at once and dealt with according to law. Translation of Durbar yad No. 1534, dated 29tli August 1874, referred to in the P.S. of my yad No. 1613, dated 29th August 1874. T he Kamdar of the Fouzdaree has submitted yad No. 768 of 1874, and I have therefore the honor to state that there being a dispute about land between the Thakoor of Ghantoo under Beejapoor and the Thakoor of Deyrole in the Mahee Kanta, the latter came with a number of men and quarrelled with the Ghantoo people. Two of the Ghantoo people have been injured by gun-shots, and a Kamdar has go^ie there from here to make enqiiiries. On his investigating into the matter particulars will be communicated. But just at present arrangements may be made that the Deyrole people may not come into the Ghantoo limits and make a disturbance or quarrel. Residency yad No. 1457, dated 7th August 1874, to Durbar, referred to in paragraph 6 of my yad to Durbar, No. 1613 of 29th August 1874. T he endorsement received from the Political Agent, Mahee Kanta, dated 29th July 1874, No. 3031, is herewith sent with accompaniments. The Political Agent states to the following effect:—That this year the people of Deyrole, in the Sabur Kanta, went to cultivate their land in their limits ; but the Thakoor of Ghantoo, Pergunnah Beejapoor, went there accompanied by others and obstructed the cultivation. The Political Agent made a reference to the AVywutdar of Beejapoor on the 22nd July 1874, but no reply has been received. Arrangements have been made by the Political Agent to send sowars, in order that the Deyrole people may not be obstructed in cultivating the land. If the Deyrole land remains uncultivated owing to the obstruction of the Ghantoo people, the Durbar will be responsible. The above will be known from the Political Agent's communication. Last year a similar 0203 obstruction was made by the Gliantoo people, and they were sent for trial to the Political Agent by the Durbar, and they have endeavoured to do the same again. Please take this misbehaviour of them into consideration, and speedily prevent them obstructing the Deyrole people from cultivating this year, and return the accompaniments with your reply. On the 22nd August 1874 the Political Agent, Mahee Kanta, wrote to the President as follows : No. 3537 (referred to in paragraph 7 of my yad to Durbar, No. 1613 of 29th August 1874). Ihe boundary between Deyrole and Ghantoo, Pergunnah Beejapoor, has been settled. The Ghantoo Thakoor obstructed cultivation in the limits of Deyrole, about which an endorsement No. 3031, dated 29th July 1874, has been sent, but no reply received or any arrangements made. On the 19th August 1874 the Sabur Kanta Thannadar went into the limits of Deyrole in order that, the Ghantoo Thakoor might not obstruct the Deyrole people in cultivating the Deyrole lands. The Ghantoo Thakoor came with a large collection of men, and some (persons) received gun-shot wounds, so all returned, and the land remained uncultivated. To this effect a report has been received from the Sabur Kanta Thannadar, No. 480, dated 19th August 1874, a copy of which is herewith sent. You will see from it how the Ghantoo Thakoor has been conducting himself, and no arrangement is made. Please therefore arrange speedily and send a reply. A prima facie case will be sent, hereafter. I have sent for information as to the losses sustained by the Thakoor of Deyrole by reason of the land having remained uncultivated. On receipt of it I will communicate further with you. The following is the Report of the Thannadar of SalAir Kanta, dated 19th August 1874, No. 48UR. referred to by Major LeGeyt in his above yad. ' A greeably to the above order the Thakoor of Deyrole stated that he would go to cultivate the laud to-day, and asked for sowars. Agreeably to order six sowars were given to him. The Thakoor ploughed the land and commenced sowing. The Ghantoo Thakoor came there with about a thousand armed men and obstructed the cultivators, he having come there with the intention of creat ing a disturbance. This having been reported to me I personally went to the spot and found that the Thakoor had come there with 7 or 800 armed men. He was told that by order of the Sirkar the Deyrole Thakoor w r as cultivating land in his limits, and that it was not right for him to prevent or obstruct it. That if he had any real representations to make, they should be made through his superior authorities; that he was a Thakoor, and that it was not right that he should come to make a disturbance in this way. The Thakoor paid no attention to this. He said that the bullocks yoked to the ploughs of the Deyrole people and the cultivators would be killed. So saying, he with the men of the village of Serolee, &amp;c., who were with him, entered the ravines in this limit and fired on the Deyrole Thakoor, who was sitting on a rising ground with 10 or 15 men. The Deyrole Thakoor, Mansingjee, then said that owing to the fear of the just Government of the Sirkar he w r as helpless; that the Ghantoo people were misbehaving themselves in this way, for which arrangements should be made. I again w r ent to the Ghantoo Tha koor in the ravines, and told him that it was not right that he did not regard the Sirkar's order; that if any Government man or any other persons were wounded by the guns which his men were firing, the responsibility would rest on him. The Thakoor, however, paid no attention to what I stated, and even in my presence he made use of some disrespectful expressions which I do not think it proper to mention in this Report. Hearing what he stated I went to the Thakoor of Deyrole, and taking him with me was returning to Deyrole. Inthe meantime the Thakoor of Ghantoo having given orders to his men, the latter fired their guns and Booputsing, the son of the Thakoor of Kaka, who had come to Deyrole on giras business and was with me, was wounded on the right leg, and Koli Thukkajee Rajajee of Tajpoor, who had come to enquire after the health of the wife of the Thakoor of Deyrole, who was sick and was with the Thakoor, was also injured on the head hy a bullet. Woman Haitbai, widow of Ramajee Vuzzajee of Deyrole, who was cutting grass in a neighbouring field, was also injured on the right hand. I have stated the above particulars for Your Honor's information. The papers of the case will be sent subsequently. This Thakoor of Ghantoo is entirely a man of no understanding, because he has no fear at all of the just Government of the Sirkar. Owing to your good wishes myself and the other Government men who had gone there were saved. If we had not received assistance from Deyrole, we had no hopes of saving our lives. Last year, on the resignation of the Thakoor of Deyrole, the case against Ghantoo people was closed by the Sirkar, but the present occasion did not show that any effect was produced on the mind of the Thakoor thereby. If the Thakoor is not severely punished this time, he will entertain hopes of doing the same thing next year. A prima facie case about this will be sent hereafter. The enquiries are not likely to prove fatal. No. 274-929, dated Baroda, 2nd September 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I n continuation of my letter No. 271-922, dated 31st ultimo, and referring to the P.

I beg respectfully to request the favor of early orders on my communi cation above quoted, pending the receipt of which I have refrained from address ing the Durbar on the subject.

Under these circumstances, I should feel much obliged by early orders as to the action which I am to take upon His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's advice to His Highness the Gaekwar ' to take no accession nuzzerana where there is a fixed land settlement.' • 3. In all the districts named there is a fixed land assessment which in itself is alleged to bear heavily upon the ryots. 64(3a No. 29P., dated Poojia, 7tli September 1874&lt;. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Resident at Baroda. I am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 264A. of 28th ultimo, re plying to the remarks of Government contained in my letter No. 25P. of 24th ultimo, on your action with regard to the appointment of Nana Saheb Khanvelkur to the honorary post of Pritinidhee, and of Mr. Dadabhoy Nowrojee to the Dewanship of the Baroda State. 2. You now explain that your whole opposition to the Gaekwar's desire to appoint Nana Saheb Khanvelkur to a purely ceremonial office applied to the question of his receiving military honors on the part of the Resident. 'All else,' you write, 'it was in the Gaekwar's own power to give without reference to us,' and you argue that as the Government have now themselves directed that no military honors should be paid to Nana Saheb Khanvelkur in virtue of any ceremonial office to which the Gaekwar may appoint him, your pro ceedings have been in accordance with the views of Government, and are not open to censure. 3. In reply to this explanation, I am directed to make the followino- quotation from paragraph 2 of your Report No. 255 of 13th ultimo. 'The Maharaja sent R. S. Bapoobhai to me to press me in regaid to Nana Saheb's appointment as Pritinidhee. Bapoobhai said that as yet the usual Poshak or dress of honor had not been conferred on Nana Saheb, because His Highness had been waiting for a recognition of his appointment by the British Government. He added that the Maharaja had been on the eve of granting him the Poshak at 4 p.m . yesterday at Mr. Dadabhoy's suggestion, 1 presume, independently of me; but that Bapoobhai had stopped the ceremony pending another reference to me. I again repeated that the act of promoting Nana Saheb to a higher office than that from which he had been displaced on the advice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General which they professed to respect and obey, would be a direct mark of disrespect to His Excellency the Viceroy, and that it would be regarded as such. Bapoobhai then argued that the Maharaja was left to do as he pleased, and why this restriction about the appointment of Pritinidhee ? I replied that the Maharaja might do as he pleased, but that if he did this, as contemplated, I should ^write a yad to the effect that I considered it to have a nullifying effect upon His Excellency the Viceroy's advice, &amp;c.' 4. The Government could not infer from this passage that you restricted your commnuications to merely declining to recognize the proposed Pritinidhee by military honors. Whatever you may have intended by them, your observa tions to Bapoobhai clearly implied that, if the Gaekwar were to appoint Nana Sahib to be Pritinidhee without your recognition, the act would be regarded as a direct mark of disrespect to the Viceroy. This communication constituted a very serious threat to the Gaekwar, as regarded his conduct in a matter which, as you admit, was within his discretion, and as such, it was disapproved by Government. The explanation now offered cannot be pronounced satisfactory. 5. As regards your opposition to the appointment of Mr. Dadabhai as Dewan, you have explained that the Gaekwar being in a painful state of doubt consulted you on the subject; that you honestly gave your opinion that Mr. Dadabhoi wanted the necessary qualifications, ' at the same time remindintr H is Highness of his entire independence in the matter.' 6. Had you restricted your communication to this effect they would have received the full approval of Government, but your reports show that you made other communications which were inconsistent with the Gaekwar's independence in thechoice or otherwise of Mr. Dadabhai. Tn your Report No. 247 of 11th ultimo, when writing of an alleged attempt on the part of Mr. Dadabhai to secure to himself full power for effecting reforms by a writen agreement with the (35 17Maharaja, you stated that you informed the Gaekwar that, as regards His Hio-h nets signing an agreement to make over his to any one whatever, except the British Government, I looked upon the very proposal on Mr. Dadabhai 's part as an offence agamst the severe,gnty of the British Power A wain as already quoted in paragraph 6 of the Government letter. No. 25P. o, 24th ultimo in reference to Mr. Dadabhai s supposed advice m the matter ot N S Khanvelkur's appointment, you observed, ' that if this was the kind of reform His Hio-hness was going to carry out under Mr. Dadabhai's administration it could end only in one result, and that very shortly.' 7 But the clearest proof that you did not contemplate the independence of the Gaekwar as regards the choice of Mr. Dadabhai is to be found in your letter to Government, No. 261 of 15th August 1874, in which you protested ao -ainst any recognition of Mr. Dadabhai 's appointment which had been made cm the part of Government. It does not appear to have occurred to you that bv this protest you were ignoring the express orders of the Government of India since any Minister would be in a false position if denied the customary recognition on the part of Government. 8 In conclusion, I am directed to state that His Excellency in Council hopes that you will see the propriety of abstaining from further discussion on these points. No. '268A., dated Baroda, 31st August 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Poltl. Dept. In reply to your confidential letter No. 26P., dated 24th August 1874, in which you require me to explain why I called upon His Highness the Gaekwar to make suitable provision for all the immediate members of the Gaekwar family, and to permit the ladies to reside away from Baroda, I have the honor to point out that a reperusal of my yad to the Durbar, No. 15330.11, will show that I did not call upon His Highness to do as you state, but 1 merely ^ 0 ~ ii * mentioned the subject * (which is one of the most •1.

I purposely mentioned no individual, either male or female, in consequence of the orders of His Excellency the Governor, and though I might have mentioned Rukhma Baee, yet, as her case was then before Government, I thought it best to defer that also. 2. Thus, whilst agreeably to the orders of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, I have invited general attention to this class of cases with a view to their settlement according to equity and reason, I have not committed the Government to the advocacy of any case in particular, whether amongst the male or female relations of His Highness the Gaekwar, and it is thus in the hands of His Highness to do justice to these much oppressed and ill-used persons, without further intervention on our part if he desires to do so, but that justice has to be done to them is clear from the orders issued on the subject. 3. Since writing my yad dated 11th to the Durbar, 1 have received the orders of Government in Her Highness Rukhma Baee's case, and I will now speak to His Highness' Minister on the subject. No. 30P., dated Bombay Castle, 7th September 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Resident at Baroda. 1 am directed to acknowledge your letter No. 268A. of 31st August last, answering the request of this Government for an explanation of your having G667 m apparently disregarded their instructions by communicating with His Highness the Gaekwar on the subject of the ladies of his family without previous reference to Government. 2. His Excellency in Council regrets that he cannot accept your explana tion as satisfactory. Having been directed by Government to make no communication to the Gaekwar, or to the Durbar about any lady, except Her Highness Rukmabaee without previous consultation with Government, you made a communication about all the ladies. Your omission to mention names in no way alters the fact of your direct disregard of the orders of Government which did not admit of such misconstruction.

From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. The next subject to which I am instructed to invite Your Highness'seri ous attention for settlement according to equity and reason in connection with the khureeta of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General, dated 25th July last, and the Proceedings of the Baroda Commission, is that of the griev ances of certain State and other Bankers at Baroda, of certain jewellers and traders of Ahmedabad, and other places trading with Baroda, as set forth in paragraph 8 groups 8, 18 and 20, and cases 37, 57, 58, 61 and 62 of Schedule II, and cases 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 of Schedule III. of the Commission Report. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General is of opinion that Your Highness would do well to put a stop to proceedings such as those taken to wards respectable Bankers and trading Firms, which are described by the Commis sion as discreditable and spoliatory, arbitrary, and unjust. I take this opportunity of bringing to Your Highness'notice that represent ations have recently been received from the Firm of Hurree Bhugtee, Chunilal Pitambar, Lowjee Oomed, Motilal Samul, Amtha Runchord, Ruthunjee Khan- dass, and Banabai Lalbhai, which with other cases of this class will form the subject of negotiation prior to authoritative advice being ultimately offered .re garding them should such appear necessary. Translation of Durbar yad No. 1458, dated 17th August 1874. I have received the Residency yads Nos. 1482C.2, 1483C.3, 1484C.4, 1485C.5 and 1486C.6, about the advice of His Excellency the Governor-Gen eral. With regard to these I have to state as follows. With respect to yad No. 1482C.2, requesting that the barbarous processes employed in my State for realizing the revenue should be prohibited, and stating that the matter being one of importance could not admit of delay, I beg to assure His Excellency that the matter has engaged my serious attention. The rules and mode of realizing the revenue, and all such matters are at present under my consideration. A complete Revenue Code will be prepared as soon as possible, which will leave no room for committing oppression. Offenders in this respect will be duly punished. In yad No. 1483C.3, you have brought to notice the subject of a moderate and equitable land settlement and a faithful adherence to its terms in future, all further exactions of every sort or description being absolutely interdicted and the continuance of such oppressive practices on the part of Durbar officials being strictly forbidden. With regard to this I have to state that the last ten years' 68settlement has expired in most of the Mahals, and it is necessary that for the current year some reasonable settlement of rates should be immediately made. Azum Kazee Shahabudin made enquiries with regard to the jummabundee of the four of the northern Mahals, viz., Beejapur, V usunggur, Burnug'g'ur, and Khyruloo, and has submitted a report, which not only suggests an immediate reduction of rates, but contains information which will be useful in making a settlement for a terms of years. With regard to other Mahals arrangements will be made as soon as possible. In the Nowsaree districts the Hoozoor Soobah has been making the necessary enquiries with a view to make reasonable reductions in the rates of assessment. The advice of His Excellency as regards the rates of jummabundee will be carried out as soon as possible; the terms of settlement will be adhered to, and no illegal increase made ; no oppressive practices on the part of the Durbar officials will be permitted, and any official found guilty thereof will be punished. Yad No. 1484C.4 relates to the adoption of some equitable mode of dealing with the Wutton and eaams of my State so as to remove all ground for anxiety and discontent among the holders of them. With regard to this, 1 have to state that the Wuttons which had been attached by His Highness Khunderao were released from attachment last year; a general enquiry is to be made into the matter. 1 shall hereafter communicate my views on the import ant subject of Wuttons and Enams. Yad No. 1485C.5 has reference to the exercise of the strictest supervision over the subordinate officials so as to prevent the horrible practices of torture which were established before the Commission, and to severely punish those who may be guilty of them. With regard to this I have to state that this important subject under notice has already engaged my attention, and without loss of any time whatever such measures will be adopted as will in my opinion effect the desired reform. In yad No. 1486C.6 I have been requested to arrange that punishments awarded for offences bear some reasonable relations to the crimes committed, and be not scandalously excessive as in some of the cases proved before the Commission. With regard to this I have to state that this subject too has engaged my attention. Better regulations for civil, criminal, and revenue matters than that now in force are under preparation. When these are brought into operation several of the heads of advice given by His Excellency the Governor-General will have practical effect. T will at short intervals communicate to you, for the information of the Bombay Government and the Goverimient of India, particulars as to the progress towards reform in each of the matters above set forth ; and I will gladly avail myself of your advice as necessity arises. I trust that if suitable opportunity is given to i^e, and I obtain hearty assistance from you, I will be able to assure His Excellency the Governor- General that the confidence reposed in me will not go for nothing; and that every advice of His Excellency will be really carried out as soon as possible. Translation of Durbar yad No. 1460, dated J 7th August 1874. I have received the Residency yads Nos. 1502C.7 and 1503C.8, dated 12th August 1874, and 1518C.9, dated 14th August 1874, and with regard thereto, 1 have the honor to state as follows. Yad No. 1502C.7 states that His Excellency the Governor-General has directed you to urge on me to conform to the recommendations of the Com mission. In connection with this, I have been requested in consultation with you to frame general rules for adoption in giving effect to reductions of Sirdars and Silladars, &amp;c., &amp;c. With regard to this some information is to be collected G9 18and the matter is to be fully thought over. I will therefore furth r commu nicate with you about it hereafter. In yad Np. 1503C.8 the following subject was brought to my notice, viz., that with the object of preventing the sale of appointments generally in my service by the levy of nuzzerana and suppressing extortion on the part of office-holders, that I should introduce the system of paying fair salaries for the performance of duty and issue a proclamation forbidding the levy of nuzzerana on all appointments, copy of such proclamation being furnished for the information of Government. With regard to this 1 beg to state that I am about to adopt full measures for giving adequate salaries to officials ; the practice of taking nuzzeranas has been done away with for some time past, still a pro clamation will be made as desired by the Resident, and a copy sent to the Residency. In yad No. 1518C.9 you requested me to put a stop to and severely punish any persons concerned in the abduction of women for forced service in the Palace. With regard to this I beg to state that the forcible abduction of women for forced service does not take place. If any one is concerned in such oppression he will be punished. Translation of Durbar yad No. 1560, dated 4th September 1874. I have received the Residency yads Nos. 1532C.10, 1533C.11, and 1534C.12, dated 17th August 1874. With reference to these, I beg to state—In yad No. 2532C.10 the opinion of the Viceroy and Governor-General as regards the relatives and dependants of the late Gaekwar is given, which will be taken into consideration and attended to. In yad No. 1533C.11 it is stated that proper provisions should be made tor the near relatives of the Gaekwar, and if any of the ladies wish to live out of Baroda they should be allowed to do so after an allowance is made to them with the approval of the Bombay Government. With respect to this I beg to state that 1 quoted the decision of* the Bombay Government about not interfering with the Gaekwar's family affairs in my yad No. 177 of 1874, and fully trust that the British Government will not interfere with the Gaek war's family- affairs. I he arrangements for the near relatives of this Government are made according to their merits; Rukhmabaee's case is knowm to ynu, and according to yad No. 1346 of 1874, sent (to the Residency), arrangements have been proposed for her in accordance with the advice of the Governor-General, and has been communicated to you orally. In yad No. 1534C.12 it is stated that a proclamation should be issued prohibiting corporal punishment of women, and their oppression either in this or in any other way in prison, courts, or by police officers, and that whoever does so would be punished. A proclamation to this effect will be issued and a copy sent to you. Translation of Durbar yad No. 1656, dated 21st September 1874. R esidency yad No. 1732C.14, dated 16th September, stating that the Ghas Dhana due from the Beejapore Thakoors should be fixed to a certain period not less than ten years. But the cess due from them is jummabundee and not Ghas Dhana; the matter will however receive due consideration, and any aid required from you will be received with pleasure. I ranslation of Durbar yad No. 1668, dated 28rd September 1874. As stated in our yad No. 1460, dated 17th August 1874, we have prepared and issued a proclamation, two copies of which are herewith sent. 70Proclamation by Shrimunt Sirkar Sena Khas Khel Sumsher Bahadoor. It is notified to the public by this proclamation that any person offerino- a nuzzerana in order to obtain Government employment, ui* accepting it for conferring such, or any person attempting to do either, shali be liable to the punishment provided for the offence of offering or accepting a bribe, and if such person be a Government servant, he shall be lialde to dismissal.

I am directed by His Excellency the Governor in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 10th instant, No. 319-1109, submitting copies of yads addressed to and received from the Durbar in connection with the decision of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council on the Commission Report. No. 307-1069, Baroda Residency, dated 2nd October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Referring to Government letter No. 22P., dated 6th August 1874, para graph 6, clause 3, and my yad to the Durbar, No. 1503C .8., having reference to the prohibition to the levy of nuzzerana on appointments in the Gaekwar State, forwarded with my letter No. 254-854, dated 12th ultimo, I have the honor to enclose a copy of the proclamation issued by His Highness the Gaek war on the subject, together with its English translation. The manner in which this proclamation is acted up to will be the subject of future report. Proclamation by Shrimunt Sirkau Sena Khas Khel Sumsher Bahadoor. I t is notified to the public by this proclamation that any person offering a nuzzerana in order to obtain Government employment, or accepting it for con ferring such, or any persons attempting to do either, shall be liable to the punish ment provided for the offence of offering or accepting a bribe, and if such person be a Government servant he shall be liable to dismissal. Dated 27th Rujab corresponding with Shravun Sumbut 1931. Enclosure No. 26. No. 6832, dated Bombay Castle, 19th November 1874. From—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, To—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to forward to you, for submission to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, the enclosed khureeta from His 71Highness the Gaekwar to the Viceroy's address, together with copy of a report from the Resident at Baroda, No. 367-1234, dated the 4th instant, commenting on tj^e representations made in the khureeta against him. 2. In forwarding these papers, this Goventment would only observe that the general considerations on which the Gaekwar's demand for the removal of the llesident is based, might with equal force have been pleaded at the time of the issue of the instructions of the Government of India on the Report of the Baroda Commission, and must no doubt have presented themselves to the mind of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council. 3. Only two instances of alleged opposition on the part of the Resident are specifically referred to in the khureeta, and the explanations that have been given by the llesident go to shew that the line of action taken by him was in one instance the combined result of disregard on the part of the Durbar of the claims and grievances of the Sirdars, and of the questionable character of the marriage contracted by the Gaekwar. 4. In the other case I am to state the Resident found himself unable to pass without notice the complaints of certain cultivators of the wrongs to which they were exposed, in spite of all their efforts to obtain redress. 5. The Progress Report referred to in paragraph 28 of Colonel Phayre's report now forwarded is being printed, and a copy of it will be furnished to the Government of India as soon as possible. No. 367-1234, dated Baroda, 4th November 1874 (Confidential.) From—Resident of Baroda, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay. In submitting to Government the accompanying khureeta addressed to their Excellencies the Viceroy and Governor-General and the Governor of Bombay by His Highness the Gaekwar, I have the honor to observe that the Resident's letter No. 134-494, dated 9th iVlay present attack appears to be a mere repe- 1874, and accompaniment. tition of that made upon Government ^Government letter No. 2951, dnted 27th May through their representative at His High- Resident's letter No. 273B., dated 22nd June ness' Court in May last, vide the COr- 'livIrlTreC'Na 3594, dated 26th Jnne respondence quoted in the margin on 1874, with copy of Government of India letter which occasion a courteous but firm obe- No. 1225P., dated 6th June 1874. dience to the orders of Government led to precisely the same results as in the instance under report. 2. The Resident then incurred His Highness the Gaekwar's odium in consequence of his non-participation in the ceremonies attendant upon His Highness' marriage with Luxmeebaee. Now he has incurred a renewed expression of the same kind of strong personal feeling owing to the delayed recognition by Government of Luxmeebaee's son as the legal heir to the Baroda guddee, the non-participation by the Resident in the ceremonies usually offered at the birth of a legal heir, non-compliance with His Highness' request for increased military honors to Nana Sahib as Pritinidhi, the events that took place at the time of the Dussera, and finally the kind warning given personally to His Highness a few days ajw reofardins: the non-commencement of reform of any kind. 3. The enclosed khureeta to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of yesterday's date may be thus briefly summarised :— [a.) That it is solely the Resident's personal hostility and open want of sympathy that is delaying the reform so urgently enjoined by His Excellency the \ iceroy, and is aggravating the exceptionally difficult position in which Mr. Dadabhai and the new administration are placed, in illustration of which two serious cases are adduced. First the action taken by the Resident in the 72case of the Sirdar Chandrarao Kuddu. Secondly, the action taken by him in the case of certain Sindhee Mahomedan cultivators. (b.) That the result of this attitude on the Resident's part has been to encourage resistance to the Durbar authority, whereby great loss in revenue has ensued and the country become unsettled. (c.) That for the reasons above given the consequences of Colonel Phayre's remaining at Baroda must be to render all efforts on their part hopeless. (d.) That the action of His Excellency the Viceroy in publicly notifyinor his confidence in Colonel Phayre, and in directing him to superintend and report on the progress of the*reforms required is unfair to His Highness the Gaekwar, and precludes the possibility of allowing him the fair trial promised. (e.) That progress has been made by His Highness the Gaekwar in the various reforms recommended, the details of which will shortly be communi cated. 4. The first of these accusations, it will be seen, is not new. It is a mere repetition of that contained in the khureetas addressed by His Highness the Gaekwar to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay, under date 9th May and 20th June 1874, relating to the action taken by the Resident under the orders of Government in the Luxmeebaee marriage case, upon which the only comment which it now seems necessary to offer is to allude to the following passage from His Excellency the Governor's reply dated 2Vth May 1874 :— 'Your Highness proceeds to complain of Colonel Phayre's general bearing as opposed to the spirit of the past relations of the two Governments. I cannot forget that it was Colonel Phayre's painful duty to remonstrate against and ultimately to report what he regarded as the extreme misgovernment prevailing in the State of- Baroda, the existence of which has been established by the enquiries of the Commission.' It will be remembered that His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General in commenting on the whole case, as shown in the correspondence under notice, was pleased to give his entire approval to the manner in which I. had carried out the orders of Government, and to express the opinion that His Highness the Gaekwar appeared from the correspondence ' to have acted in this affair with grave impropriety.' The same letter of the Government of __ India closes with the foliowinor remarks, No. 1225P., dated 6th June 1874. , • , A ® , , . ' wlncn appear to nave an important bearing on the subject immediately under report:— ' The Government of India notice with much dissatisfaction the tone of, and the expression contained in. His Highness' letter of 7th May to Colonel Phayre. Any repetition of such language will be very seriously received, and the Resident should be instructed to report at once if at any time he is not treated by His Highness the Gaekwar or his Ministers in a manner suitable to his position as representative of the British Government.' 5. With the exception of the case marginally noted, in which I complained Resident's letter to Government, No.' 202T-, dated 'f the . t0n ? aIld act 1 ™ of the present 1st August 1874s reporting five specific cases of |in- administration in a question affecting our tcrference with Britub optnm rights. British Imperial opium rights, I 'have refrained from taking any action on the serious instructions of the Government of India above quoted. This restraint I have exercised solely out of my sincere desire to promote, as far as lay within my power, the reforms so urgently required by His Excellency the Viceroy; but occasions have not been wanting when I have keenly felt the manner in which I was being treated, by being constantly importuned to do what was directly contrary to the instructions of Government and by flat denial of assertions, as to matters of fact made by me and in numerous other ways. 6. These facts are now adduced not by way of recrimination, which I entirely repudiate as having no bearing whatever uj/on the serious nature of the 73 v 19present position at Baroda, but merely to show the difficulty of a position in which any representative, at the Court of the present Gaekwar, must neces sarily be placed, who impartially and fearlessly does his duty. 7. In the present case, however, apart from the serious question of reform which it has been my duty to urge on His Highness' notice, 1 have been placed in an exceptionally difficult position owing to the disagreeable obligation I have been under of opposing certain schemes on which His Highness the Gaekwar has set his heart, as set forth in paragraph 2 above, and also owing to the fact that this system of false accusations has only been commenced under the present so -called improved administration, and appears to have a special significance as closely following the public, and I trust not unmerited, expression of confidence in myself contained in His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General's khureeta of 25th July last. 8. I now proceed to show that in the two illustrations of my alleged personal hostility which have been adduced. His Highness the Gaekwar is hopelessly in the wrong, as I have from the first most carefully abstained from every word or action to which exception could be taken as having a tendency to lower the authority, or increase the difficulties of the present administration. So far therefore from lending a ready ear to complainants, as has - been wilfully and falsely stated, my confidential Progress Report, No. 361-1225, dated 2nd instant, will show th^ I have acted with extreme forbearance, and that if there be any complaint against me at all, it is that I have systematically forced all petitioners to appeal to the Durbar and submit to its authority, even after they had repeatedly done so, and that until I was satisfied that this had been done I persistently refused them even access. 9. It was in pursuance of this policy that from the close of the Commis sion Proceedings in December 1873 up to about a month ago, I turned a deaf ear to all petitioners and refused to see them at all, though hundreds of peti tions, many of them of the most serious nature, were constantly reaching me by post from all parts of the Baroda State. The immediate effect, however, of the receipt of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General's instructions of 25th July last was that hundreds of petitioners from all parts flocked to Baroda in the expectation that their grievances would at length receive a hearing from the Durbar. It is true that many of the petitioners who had been waiting on Mr. Dadabhai for the previous eight months represented to me that it was hopeless to expect that they could get justice from one who had persistently closed his ears to all their complaints. I did my best, however, to assure them that the new administration were anxious to do justice, and that they should again represent their cases to them in accordance with the ordinary custom. My efforts, however, were of no avail : towards the end of September hundreds of petitioners returned—importuned me from day to-day saying that they had gone to Mr. Dadabhai, had fully represented their cases, but had obtained no redress for immediate pressing grievances. They represented that their crops were ripe, but that they were forbidden to cut them without signing ruinous agreements, and that they were, if anything, worse off than before, owing to an excessive system of mohsulling and demands for sowers' security both for arrears and the present crops. 10. Finding that I could no longer without positive dereliction of duty refuse to take some action on the important and voluminous complaints made to me, I first had recourse to oral communications with Mr. Dadabhai, then to confronting certain of the complainants with him, and finally on finding that no results whatever ensured, and that the advice of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-Geneial, which had been tendered about six weeks or two months previously, was a dead-letter, I at last reduced to writing the state ments of the chief complainants, and forwarded them to the Durbar for information and such action as they might see Jit. This action alone of mine elicited any notice whatever. The Minister was at length induced to allow 74crops to be cut, which in many cases were then rotting on the ground; but not without the strongest personal expostulation at any action in recording the serious statements made by the petitioners. In reply to these represent ations I took the opportunity of impressing on Mr. Dadabhai that in thus providing the Durbar with clear statements of the specific grievances com plained of, with a view to their reform, I was acting in the kindest possible manner towards both His Highness the Gaekwar and his new administration, the members of which had little or no personal acquaintance with the details of the grievances complained of. Mr. Dadabhai, however, was most importunate in urging on me the necessity of more oral communications, but 1 replied that in cases where repeated oral representations had been made by me, and no results followed, it was absolutely necessary, if only for the information of Government, that I should record the exact nature of the complaints made, and show how far the action taken by the Durbar corresponded with the advice tendered by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General and the promises made in reply thereto. 11. From this explanation it will be clear to Government that the sole object of the present administration is to prevent an appeal to facts in forming an opinion upon the real grogress of reform. The Durbar have never been moved to take any action whatever to redress grievances until they have received from me a written statement of the petitioners' grievances, and then at once they have turned round and furiously attacked me for adopting the only course which can satisfactorily prove in what manner the advice of His Excel lency the Viceroy and Governor-General is being substantially acted up to. 12. I now proceed to notice the two illustrations which have been adduced by His Highness the Gaekwar in the present khureeta in support of his allega tion that 1 am actuated by unfriendly feelings towards himself and his adminis tration. 13. The first case adduced is that of a Sirdar, Chandrarao Kuddu, the circumstances of which are fully reported to Government in the list of corre spondence as follows :— 1. Kesident's telegram to Government dated 16th October 1874. 2. Letter to Government No. 331-1193, dated 16th idem. 3. Letter No. 333-1148, dated 17th October 1874. 4. Telegram to Government dated 18th October 1874. 5. Telegram to Government dated 19th October 1874. 6. Government telegram dated 19th October 1874. 7. Telegram to Government dated 20th October 1874. 8. Letter No. 343-1168, dated 20th October, with accompanying corre spondence with Durbar. 14. It only remains to add certain explanation with regard to the Durbar version of the case, now for the first time submitted, not to me, but His Excel lency the Viceroy and Governor-General, under circumstances in themselves suspicious. The Durbar correspondence on the subject with the Resident will be found with the Government letter, &amp;c., quoted Ainder No. 8 of the above correspondence. It will be seem that in the Durbar yads to my address dated 19th October (the day before the Dussera) no such imputations are made as in the khureeta of the 2nd November under notice, which may be stated as follows :— —That the Resident was prepared to justify the conduct of the Sirdars who had banded together. 2nd. —That the Resident declined to use his influence to disperse the Sirdars, on the ground that they had a legitimate grievance by the institution of criminal proceedings against one of their number. 7576 3rd—That he subsequently again justified their conduct by adverting to their pending grievances. 15. These imputations appear therefore to be an after-thought, and though they would be, on this account, undeserving of serious attention, I proceedlo notice them seriatim. The first imputation is wholly false, and must have been known to be so by the writer of the khureeta, as it was solely through the Resident's inter vention that the Sirdars were ultimately induced to disperse, and allow the Dussera procession to proceed as usual. With regard to the second point, I have only to observe that I gave advice to His Highness' Minister, the spirit of which I am happy to say was immediately followed with the desired results, although the occasion of the birth of a son was eagerly seized by the Durbar to retire from an untenable position of great danger. The third imputation is wholly false with regard to the alleged justification of the Sirdars' conduct on my part; I did, however, point out to Mr. Dadabhai the very great danger of allowing a large number of Sirdars and military classes to remain with their grievances unredressed as brought to notice in my yad to the Durbar, No. 1695, dated 19th October 1874, and again in No. 1982 of the 20th idem, the day of the Dussera. 16. To these views Mr. Dadabhai had of course no objections to offer, and therefore 1 am the more surprised that the above accusations should have found expression in this unusual manner. 17. With regard to the second illustration adduced relating to the case of certain Mussulman Sindhee cultivators residing in the Baroda and other Pergunnas of the Baroda State, I have the honor to remark that the illustration in question appears to be even more unfortunate than the last. 18. The case of these petitioners was reported to Government in my letter Ko. 350-1106 of 27th October 1874, with accompaniments, viz., a petition dated October 1874, with two accompaniments, one to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, and the other to the address of His Excellency the Governor, • No 19S6 Bombay. It will be seen that the* obnoxious yad re ferred to by His Highness theGaek war was addressed to the Durbar on October 20th, the day of the Dussera procession, and was written at a time when the serious assemblage of Sirdars referred to in the preceding case (paragraph 14 supra) was going on. It must also be observed that the petitioners, who are Sindhees by race, have only taken to agriculture under the protection of their Sirdars, and are liable to be called upon for military service by them at any time. The connection therefore between this body of men and the discontented military class is obvious, and constituted the real danger of allowing their emergent and other grievances to remain unredressed. 19. With reference to this petition and my yad to the Durbar, No. 1986 of 20th October 1874, I think it material at the outset to state that the writer DUhigemons conduct of His High- of the khureeta has for some reason or other . suppressed the original petition to my address, which was the subject of my yad above referred to, and has very ingeniously, but somewhat disingeniously, favored Government with a translation of another petition addressed not to me, but to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay, which was not referred to hy me in my yad No. 1986 at all, but which was merely sent to the Durbar as one of the accompaniments to the petition to my address. I did not in fact take any trouble to make myself acquainted with the subject ot any petition of these Sindhees other than those addressed to myself; nor would the petition to His Excellency the Governor have been forwarded to the Durbar at all had not direct allusion been made to it in the petition to my address above referred to.20. In order, however^ to enable Government to understand the significance of the manoeuvre which appears to have been perpetrated by substituting for the original petition, which was the subject of my yad No. 198^6, a mere accom paniment to the said petition, I have the honor to annex herewith copy ot the petition addressed to me by the Sindhees in question, side by side with copy ot their petition addressed to His Excellency the Governor^ which lias been the sub ject of Mr. Dadabhai's indignant remarks. 21. From a comparison of the petition to my address hereto annexed, with the petition addressed to His Excellency the Governor, translation oi which has been submitted by the Durbar with their khureeta un-der report, it will be seen why Mr. Dadabhai has deliberately suppressed the one and cow merited on the other. The petition to His Excellency the Governor is vague an its allegations, and is couched in a tone which I am very far from approving of, and should not have sent to the Durbar at all, had it come under my immediate observation, which as before stated was confined to the peftition addressed to myself. 22. On the other hand the petition addressed to myself, which was the exclusive subject of my yad No. 1986, appears to be far more specific in its allega tions, and to be perfectly proper and respectful in tone. I moreover took the oppor tunity of questioning the petitioners personally regarding the subject of then- petition, and from their manner and general bearing, I am respectfully of opinion that the allegations made are substantially correct. This opinion, moreover, is confirmed by the fact which appears to have been disingenuously suppressed, that Mr. Dadabhai was in fact induced, by my representations in my yad ]So. 1986 under reference, to grant the petitioners the immediate and emergent redress sought, bv allowing them to cut their crops and promising consideration of their case. On these conditions the Sindhees have at length returned to their villages, and thus notwithstanding Mr. Dadabhai's piesent indignant protest, the main object of my representation has in fact been gained ; and moreover what, undei the circumstances of the Dussera festival above related, w T as a serious danger, has been averted. 23. It only remains to notice the statement made in the khuieeta that these complainants had never previously represented their grievance to any Dur bar authority. This statement, I regret to state, I must pronounce to be entirely without foundation; nor can I imagine how the writer of the khuieeta could have been induced to represent to His Excellency the Viceroy in a foima •public document, a fact, the falsity of which happens to be susceptible of speci fic proof. These petitioners have been, as stated in their petition to my address, (copy annexed), perpetually importuning the Durbar to grant them rediess during the last eight months. 1 took care to question them particulaily on tins point, and I believe their representations to be substantially correct. 1 hey have, moreover, produced for niv satisfaction a receipt for a registered letter i ecent y addressed to Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee ; and they assured me that their chief re presentative and karkoons have been in daily attendance at the Duibai or weeks past, trying in vain to procure a settlement of their long pending giie\- ances. In the face, therefore, of evidence of this nature, I can only suppose t lat the writer of the khureeta has either been misinformed, or has wilfully intent e( to deceive His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General. At the same time I think it my duty to state, and 1 do it with much regret, that it is now becoming the systematic practice of the new administration to ignore long pending grievances, and to deny in unmeasured terms, that the petitioners ^ho have oi months been importuning, first the Keaident, secondly the Commission, tlnu v Government, have ever represented their grievances to any responsible in ar official. - 24. Having thus noticed the two main illustrations given of my alleged unfriendly attitude, it only remains for me to notice briefly the remaining pomtb alluded to in paragraph 3 above.With reference to the alleged results of the Resident's unfriendly attitude (C. paragraph 3 above), I may remark that there can be no doubt that the intervention of Government by means of the Commission and His Excellency the Viceroy's instructions on their report have neccessarily tended to encourage resistance to a perpetuation of the oppressive system in all branches of the adminstration which it was my duty first to bring to notice. I am not aware that any resistance has been offered to the exercise of any lawful authority by the Durbar officials; in fact it is to me truly marvellous that the people should have remained so submissive under the system of absolute slavery in which they have long been held. 25. With reference to the alleged loss of revenue, it is obvious that the advice of His Excellency the \ iceroy and Governor-General regarding exces sive exactions, guddee nuzzerana, &amp;c., must necessarily, for the current year at least, cause a temporary loss of revenue ; but this result is not, I think, under the circumstances, one for which His Highness is entitled to appeal for sympathy. 26. With reference to the 3rd head (c), relating to the required dismissal of myself as Resident, I have lon^ been aware that my removal from Baroda constitutes the chief object of the present Maharaja and his advisers. This is not to be wondered at, considering the part which I have had to play durino- the last 18 months. The present Maharaja and his advisers are fully aware^that I am thoroughly cognizant of all that has been and is going on, that I am not to be cajoled, intimidated, or deterred from carrying out to the best of my ability the orders of Government; and under these circumstances, they are filled with a natural fear that any sham or imposture will not be allowed to pass current with out notice from me. It is material, however, to note that my personal relations with the Maharaja himself are, as they always have been, of a friendly and satisfactory nature, and no one is more aware than the Maharaja himself, as he has frequently Vide kimreeta, 25th October 1873. admitted to me ^ that my advice is for the real benent of himself and his State. 27. With reference to the 4th head (d) as noted in paragraph 3, viz., that the action of His Excellency the Viceroy in publicly notifying his confidence in me, and in directing me to superintend and report on the progress of the re forms required is unfair to His Highness the Gaekwar, and precludes the possibility of allowing him the fair trial promised ; 1 have only to remark that His Excellency is the best judge of the propriety of the course which he has directed to be followed ; and that the fair trial desiderated by His Highness the Gaekwar would probably imply many conditions which it would be scarcely possible for any Government to accede to. Moreover His Highness the Gaekwar appears entirely to forget that the ultimate verdict in this very serious case is in no sense dependent on any opinions or inferences of my own, but solely on proved pal pable facts, the significance and import of which the Government will alone decide, facts, however, which I have shown in paragraph 10 above, the present Minister is most anxious to suppress. 28. With regard to the final statement (e alluded to in paragraph 3 above) that progress has been made by His Highness the Gaekwar in the various reforms recommended, the details of which will shortly be communicated, I have on!}' to state that it will be time enough for me to criticise this statement when it appears; but in the meantime I would respectfully invite the careful attention of Government to my confidential progress report No. 361-1225, dated 2nd instant, just forwarded, which contains an exhaustive narrative of what has actually occurred in each group of cases that came before the Commission. 1 would further respectfully submit, fur the consideration of Govern ment, that had real reform commenced in the Baroda State, such a khureeta as that under reply could not have been written, more especially after the serious waiaing conveyed in His Excellency the Viceroy's khureeta of 25th July last. e lev e, however, that in addition to the special personal reasons for this unscem } attack noticed in paragraph 2 above, another important motive is sup-plied by the fact that on the date that I received the kliureeta in question I completed my progress report of the past three months that have elapsed since the receipt ot His Excellency the Viceroy's instructions. It will not escape notice that the writer of the Durbar khureeta under report has more than once made special allusion to the progress of the reforms effected during this very period, and taking into consideration the whole tone and spirit of that communi cation, 1 think it extremely probable that this khureeta has been written in the hope of nullifying the effects of my serious report. 30. In conclusion I cannot but notice as somewhat significant the direct reference in this matter to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council instead of to my immediate superior His Kxcellency the Governor of Bombay. 1 he meaning of this, however, appears to be obvious enough : on the last occasion that His Highness thought fit to charge me with offering him an ' open outrage and public insult ' for carrying out the instructions of 'Govern ment, he submitted my conduct for the consideration of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay. The courteous but firm refusal of His Excellency to recognize the propriety of the unseemly attack made in that instance on an officer of high rank, was doubtless extremely galling to His Highness who con tinued to appeal until the Government thought fit to close the correspondence. In the present instance His Highness has shown his want of confidence in the Bombay Government by summarily appealing in the same unreasonable manner to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General. Petition, dated October 1874=Aso Sud Sumbut 1931. From— Sindhee Guja Nuthoomia and 19 others, To—Resident at Baroda. T he petition of the undersigned Sindhees of the Gaekwar Government, residing in the villages of the Baroda, Atursumba, Kyraloo Pergunnahs. Our » vide Smiar's complaint No. is. officer Shah' JVIahomed biiiTladliun Meeas, ancestors Appendix g .. Commission Report. ^ t i ie ] ate Hamed Jemadar, entered the service of the Gaekwar Government in about Sumbut 1821, or A.D. 1764. Since that time Hamed Jemadar and his descendants, Ameen Saheb, &amp;c., brought our ancestors from our own country, Sindh, and introduced them into the service of the Gaekwar Government as useful to fight and conquer territories for them ; and as our Jemadars obtained wuttuns, &amp;c., from the Gaekwar Government, who considered them as their children, so finding us useful in the conquest of countries some of our ancestors obtained monthly emoluments and appoint ments and others landed property, thus leaving our own country w r e settled in this strange land ; and we were taken care of by the Gaekwar Government as arranged by our Jemadars. Since our settlement here we acquired landed property by purchase and mortgage, and continued enjoying them without obstruction. In the reign of the late Khunderao Maharaj they commenced forciblv levvino- from us Inam Committee and other cesses, but on our representing the matter to Government these cesses were not collected; meanwhile Mulharrow Maharaj ascended the throne, and a rumour was circulated that the Inam Committee fee was abolished, which pleased the people ve^ much. Subsequently Khanvilkar, the brother-in-law of the Maharaj. became Minister, and the I nam Commitcee and other new cesses were ordered to be levied; and the Wahiwutdars com menced pressing us for the payment of these cesses. Finally our Jemadar lladha Meea adopted Shah Mahomed with the sanction of the Gaekwar Govern ment and the management was conducted by him, although no emoluments were paid, and many of us too did not receive our proper emoluments, which inconvenienced us very much in our expenses. We several times petitioned Government to make proper arrangements, but obtained no redress ; we were 7980 thus distressed in every way and therefore reported the matter to you. Before the Commission our jemadars represented all our grievances, and petitioned Bombav and India Governments, but nothing has been arranged. After this Dadabhai was appointed Minister in the place of Khanvilkur who was made Pritinidhi; and we petitioned Dadabhai personally for redress, but did not obtain it. Meanwhile the A\ ahiwutdar continued pressing us for the payment and the new cesses, so we reported the matter but obtained no reply. Our helplessness increased daily; at last we sent a registered petition by post on the 2nd of Badrafud Wud Snmbut 1931 ai\d enclosed an anna postage stamp for a reply ; but up to this no arrangement has been made, neither have we received a reply. If we poor people go to the house of the Minister Dadabhai we find him secluded, and with great difficulty get the sepoys to convey our message and receive a reply to come to the palace. Very often our message even is not conveyed thus although we go there we very seldom get a reply. If we go to the palace we sepoys cannot effect an entrance owing to our arms ; but should Ave finally succeed in getting into the Palace we find the Dewan engaged in important business of the State, and he does not think of the case of us poor people, neither do we receive a written reply. If we wish to complain orally we cannot get in owing to the large gathering in the Durbar, and if we wish to speak we cannot do so, because people are warned that they are not to speak until they are called. It is therefore difficult to' see the Dewan in the palace, and the Dewan himself does not send for us, because we are poor and our complaint is trifling; and for want of funds we are unable to engage a vakil to plead our cause; for these reasons we cannot obtain redress from the Durbar; if we send reports they are never heard of; w r e cannot even find out where they go to. Our last registered report has not as yet been replied to. We therefore now beg to. state that we have already * They have always been referred petitioned you once before and being quite help- to the Durbar up to the present time less petition you acrain.'' You will kindly take when the matter has become serious. „ • , i _ 11 i our case into consideration and arrange that we may without obstruction receive our usual emoluments, and that we may not be harassed with new cesses on our land. Our ancestors acquired these our wuttuns by shedding blood, and we are deterred from enjoying them owing to the obstructions complained of above ; those obstructions are not removed and no arrangements to continue our rights to us are made, but we hear that a reduction of 25 per cent, in the emoluments has been ordered by Government. [ * As shown above we are quite destitute for want of food and clothing, and have • contracted hundreds of rupees' debt; and if the above order about reduction is brought into force ourselves and our wives and children will have to die. We jA request therefore that you will t ike all these circumstances into consideration and make early arrangements for us. At present our crops are standing in our fields and the time for reaping has arrived ; if we attempt to reap them the The same complaint is general every- A\ uhiwutdar prevents us from doing so, and places mohsuls for the collection of the new cesses named above; the crops standing in the fields are partly destroyed by birds and animals; these oppressions among us and the state of the crops ready for harvest is as stated above. Some have sublet their lands to those that have no land of their own, they too are obstructed ; this leaves us entirely destitute. Strict arrangements should therefore, be made to put a stop to mohsuls and to allow us to reap our crops. Owing to the reduction of Ks. 25 per cent, ordered, the Sowcars do not trust us ; ive have petitioned the Bombay Government on the same subject, copy of which as also the copy of our 'petition to Calcutta Government is hereto appended for your information. If you take the circums tances of this petition into consideration and make proper arrangements for us it is well; otherwise each day will add to our hardships. Arrangements should therefore be made within eight days and a reply given to us. One anna postage stamp is enclosed for a reply.(h-C) ¥ No. 1986, dated 20tli October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. Referring to my yad No. 2693, dated 8th November last year, and to the recent ebullition of the discontent amongst the military classes of the State, I beg to bring specially to Your Highness' notice the accompanying petition received this day from a number of Sindhees, the adherents of Sirdars, &amp;c., some of whom have for some years past taken to cultivation in Your Highness' Mahals in order to obtain a livelihood. Instead of such a desirable mode of providing for superfluous military retainers being encouraged as it ought to be, it appears from the petition of these poor people that the very reverse is the case, I request therefore that • Sic in orig. Your Highness will at once order that substantial justice to % be done in this case, which has been so strongly inculcated by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in his khureeta of the 25th July last. Now that the peace of the country is endangered on all sides, I must beg seriously to press upon Your Highness' notice that nothing short of an immediate performance of the promises which you have from time to time made to Government during the last year and upwards will satisfy His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General that there is any meaning or reality in those promises. To His Excellency the Right Hon'ble the Governor of Bombay. The humble petition of the undersigned Sindhee inhabitants of the villages of Uttersoomba, Khai- raloo, &amp;-c., under Baroda Prant. R espectfully S heweth .,—That your Petitioners' ancestors being originally the inhabitants of Sind were brought to this country, the Baroda State, by the late Hamid Jemadar Saheb, and afterwards by his son, Amin Saheb, and other Jemadars, &amp;c., during the time of His Highness the late 1st Futtesing Rao Maharaja in Sumbut 1821 (A.D. 1764) a period of war and trouble, for the purpose of the conquest of this country. At this time some of the ancestors of your petitioners died while on duty or fighting, and others proved of use and service to this State (during their lives). In consequence of which the rights and privileges of wuttun were granted to the aforesaid Jemadars in the same way as are enjoyed by the ' chiranjeers,' or heirs of of the 44 Gadhee' or State. In like manner, your petitioners being regarded as entitled to a participation of the wuttuns, lands and salaries were assigned to them in Guzerat for their maintenance or service. In this way your petitioners, who were foreigners, were retained here as permanent residents of this country. They came into possession of lands by virtue of mortgage, &amp;c., and these acquired lands as well as their ' wuttuns ones,'t were continued to them unin terruptedly, and they also enjoyed the rights and privileges till the time of th^ late Khundee Rao Maharaj. Afterwards taxes in the shape of inam committee, &amp;c., were demanded from your petitioners, and the same were taken by the Wywutdars from some of them by force, which induced your petitioners to go to Baroda to make a representation to the Hoozoor (Sirkar), on doing which the new imposts were discontinued. In the year of Sumbut 1927 on the accession of His Highness Mulharao Maharaj, and on the installation of the late Gopal Rao Myral as Dewan, the inam committee tax was abolished. Afterwards Nana Saheb Khanvilkur, brother- in-law of His Highness, became Dewan, and he ordered the ' inam committee' together with the other new taxes to be reimposed. In consequence of these orders the Wywutdar compelled your petitioners to pay the same. Whereuponyour petitioners made a representation of their case several times to the Sirkar but to no purpose. Feeling helpless at this, your petitioners were compelled to petition the Resident at Baroda for redress, and your petitioners' masters, the Jemadars, also laid most of your petitioners' grievances before the Baroda Com mission. Afterwards your petitioners submitted their petitions both to Your Excellency's Government and the Calcutta Oovernwient. A copy of the peti tion to the latter is herewith appended for your information. Notwithstanding this they could not get any redress. Afterwards the Karkhana of the Paga was entrusted by the Sirkar to the descendant of the late Hamid Jemadar, by name Shah Mahomed Mirza bin Radkuh Mirja, on his being confirmed in the same, and although he managed it, he did ttot get the full nemnook from the Sirkar for several years, which was the cause of your petitioners not getting their pay in full. This put them to much distress. It was aggravated by the Wywutdar preventing your peti tioners from reaping the crops of their fields, and mohsuls were imposed on your petitioners. This necessitated your petitioners to make an application to the Dewan, Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, who paid no attention to it, nor did he pass any endorsement on the petition. Disappointed at this, your petitioners had recourse to the Resident for redress. A copy of this application has been herewith annexed, a perusal of which will convince Your Excellency of the extent of the oppression under which they are groaning by reason of mohsuls, &amp;c. It is now nearly seven or eight months since Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee has been here, and that he has been exercising the functions of the ' de facto Dewan' since about a month and a half or two. Mr. Dadabhai has entrusted the charge of the Revenue and Criminal Departments with their executive functions to the * New Mundallee' (men) of his own selection, and has made a good bundobust (arrangement) for himself and them by way of ' nemnook.' Although he is repeatedly told by the Resident to give redress to the ryots of the Baroda State, so as to stop their complaints, he does not do so, as he and the new authorities whom he has invested with power are quite unacquamted with the system of the Oaekwar Government. Nor can he, for it has been oftstomary with the Ministers hitherto to hear petitions o'penlv &lt;at their own houses, or in the Kutchery at His Highness' Palace, and decide the cases in the presence of the petitioners which tended to give immediate redress to them. In the present in^ance the petitioners cannot have personal access to any of the officials, the place where they sit being in a very secluded locality;*' further they have to report to the sepoy near the entrance to give notice of their oom- ing to the ' authorities and they are only caMed up if it suits their pleasure to do so. Generally it happens that they have to go back without getting a hearing. In the Durbar also, if the case of any petitioner happens to be called oat, the petitioner is only called in, if it suits their pleasure to do so, or else he has to go back. This necesarily places many persons, whose cases are just, to grjpat disadvantage. If after all this any one is bold enough to go near the Minister, the latter expresses himself as follows to him ' This is a very large State, and I hate a Very pressing work before me ; as I am alone, how ca!h 1 get through your buisiness T Such Es the state of affairs. This put ytfnr petitioners -in mind that the Minister being a resident under British rule Wants to act the part of an Englishman in this respect, viz., to show his love of working in solitude as Europeans do. But it ought to be remembered that Europeans do hear the petitions of petitioners, and do grant them justice ; while this man wants only to imitate the manners of Europeans without giving satisfaction to any one. In consequence of this, thousands of helpless people who have had no redress given them have been plunged into despair. \ our petitioners however beg to submit that the only alternative left them is to petition Your Excellency ; but although they did so several times, no notice has beefn taken of their 'petitions up to this time. Their case 'is rendered the 82more desperate by the circumstance of the new officials being quite unacquainted with the ' business routine ' of this State, the latter therefore are unable to help them out of their difficulties. Hence they are afraid to complain at all; for if they do, the Resident does not arrange their matter, and it only exposes them to the risk of incurring the displeasure of the Durbar officials. People of this State are quite unacquainted with the English rules and regulations, and the new officials do always say something about these rules and regulations. It follows therefore that these persons, with the dint of their authority and the force of their intelligence, can concoct thousands of schemes of a nature to cause injury to the people. For it appears that Mr. Dadabhai's mission at this Court has been that of simply defending the late Dewan Nana Saheb and the other officials who were implicated in oppressing the people. These people had, in consequence of their grievances, applied to the Resident for redress. An enquiry was thereupon ordered to be instituted into their complaints by the Supreme Government, and Mr. Dadabhai's advent was for the purpose of help ing to save the aforesaid persons from the consequences of their deeds and to break down the cause of the complainants. Since Dadabhai has been a Dewan he has not settled a single case. He has also contemplated to impose the obnoxious tax of 25 per cent, on the income of the ' Hakdari Class ' ot people ; while he has completed a very excellent arrangement of securing thousands of rupees for himself and his colleagues. It will be plainly seen from this that he is quite incapable of making satisfactory arrangements in the State so as to keep the people pleased. In order to settle differences and make a satisfactory arrangement in the State, at present it is necessary, and your petitioners trust that Your Excellency will direct the selection and appointment to the post of Dewan, through the Resident, of an able and experienced Kamdar, and at the same time one who is a hereditary servant of the State. He should have the assistance of impartial and just Kamdars in the administration of the State affairs, and the latter being respectable residents of this place will hesitate to do anything wrong, their con duct and reputation being a sufficient ' guaranteeand these functionaries should arrange all differences according to the Resident's wishes, a measure which will tend to giv-e satisfaction to all the parties concerned and the clamor will subside. But if Mr. Dadabhai were by dint of his authority to make any arrangement for the people, as to him seems best, that would never remove the cause of the dissatisfaction of the people. It will only have the effect of . exhausting their patience day by day and of annihilating the ' Hakdars.' Under such circumstances, your petitioners humbly crave that Your Excel lency will be pleased to take their case (of extreme hardship) into your con sideration, and order the Resident to make a speedy arrangement for them. Your petitioners have enclosed postage stamps for the favor of an answer from Your Excellency. As your petitioners .are now on the 'brink of starvation,' should there be no prospect .of a speedy arrangement of their huks, they will be forced, in that event, to have recourse to those measures for securing justice which their ancestors adopted in past times, for as the proverb runs ' It is better for one to sell his life dearly than to die the miserable death or with one's head in one's hands occasioned by exhaustion of one's limbs (feet).' Your peti tioners, however, have thought proper to make a full representation of their case, in the hope that it will induce Your Excellency to pity, and also -that no blame may be attached to them, if, in the end, tliey are compelled to adopt such a course. (Ashwin Shoodh 9th, Sumbut 1930)=A.D. 1874. (Sd.) SiKDUJi G ajhe N atha M la and 24 others. S3Enclosure No. 27. Khureeta, dated Baroda Palace, 2nd November 1874. From—His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda, To—His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, Calcutta. F rom the events which occurred prior to Your Excellency's khureeta of 25th July 1874, it is plain that the administration of this State cannot be carried on and the necessary reforms introduced without the cordial support of the Resident. It had occurred to me, among other matters I desired to say in reply to the above khureeta, whether I should not solicit Your Excellency's attention to the position which the present Resident, Colonel Phayre, had all along taken up towards me, and to submit for Your Excellency's consideration whether with the want of sympathy which existed between us I could expect an unbiased and fair treatment at his hands in future. I, however, refrained from troubling Your Excellency owing to the confidence expressed by Your Excellency in Colonel Phayre, and in the hope that seeing the course I resolved to adopt on receipt of Your Excellency's advice, he w^ould forget the past and assist me with his active sympathy in the difficult work of introducing a reformed regime. But I deeply regret to say from the experience of the past three months that this hope has not only been not realized, but that on the con trary Colonel Phayre has evinced, if anything, a more determined and active opposition towards me and my administration than before. From the very commencement he had expressed a strong opposition to the selection of the Minister of my choice. The assurance of support subsequently given by him to my Minister, however, raised hopes in me, but they have not been realized. On the receipt of \ our Excellency's khureeta I at once took the necessary steps as far as practicable, and have been endeavoring all along to give effect to the advice contained therein. Among other things, I have to replace the executive machinery of government with able and experienced men to satisfv on some equitable basis th£ demands of the Sirdars and others which had received attention from the British Government, and to enquire into and revise the existing land revenue settlement throughout the whole territory. No one, however, can know better than the Resident what difficulties each of these subjects presents, especially when all this is to be effected in a very short time. But when owing to his former attitude, even Colonel Phayre's presence alone, would have been enough for a continuance of the unsettled state of the mind ot the people, unless he gave me open and cordial support, the difficulties of my work become vastly increased by the course of open opposition he has been lately pursuing, I am therefore driven to appeal to Your Excellency, which I do most reluctantly to decide whether under such circumstances I can have a lair trial. I may mention here one or two instances in support of my complaint. A an? 6 ! ( j e ^ ama ^ orl was some days ago preferred by my father-in-law against a killadar by name Chandarrao Kudu. My Dewan himself in the presence ot Lhandarrao read over the proceedings of the preliminary investigation, and in order to give both parties the benefit of an impartial trial, I directed the Chief Magistrate, Mr. H. A. Wadyar, to try the case, instead of the Senaputtee, who is my relative, ihe accused suddenly left Baroda, and I was informed went to t e camp. What he did there I cannot say. But soon after several other dars a,u ^ s ^ me Sirdars with their retainers, some hundred and fifty in number, assembled armed in the house of one of them, openly defying the -Uurbar authority and threatening armed resistance. They told the Durbar o cials who went to serve the summons on Chandarrao that the case in which is attendance was required was a caste concern, and that they would defend im with their lives, it attempts were made to enforce his attendance. They icn escorted him to his house and remained there armed to guard him. I sent ie e^ an to represent the matter to Colonel Phayre, in the hope that he would 84use the influence lie had over them and uphold the Durbar authority. But to my astonishment the Dewan found the Resident prepared to justify their con duct on the very same plea, and almost in the very same words the Silladars themselves had used. lie refused to persuade them to disperse, saying that they would do so only if the criminal proceedings were withdrawn. On the joyful occasion of the birth of my son, I resolved to give up further proceedings against Chandarrao. When I sent the Chief Justice of the High Court to explain to the assembled Silladars that further criminal proceedings would not be taken against Chandarrao, and to ask them to return to their homes, they refused to do so, and substituted in place of Chandarrao's case a new plea for resistance that unless the grievances of one and all of them were redressed they would not separate. The Resident at the same time addressed me a yad with reference to this assemblage, putting me the very same question, viz., what steps had been taken by me towards settling the grievances of the Sirdars showing a remarkable coincidence of views. As another instance I beg to enclose copy of a letter received from the Resident, dated 20th October 1874, and translation of a petition to the Govern ment of Bombay which accompanied it. The petition is from certain Sindhee Mahomedan cultivators, complaining that they were prevented from cutting their crops and were mohsaled, &amp;c. Your Excellency will observe the threat of an appeal to arms which is contained in the petition. On enquiry I find that these petitioners had not made any complaint, since the commencement of the last rainy season, either to the talooka authorities, to the head of the Revenue Department, or to the Dewan. The petition, further, on the very face of it, shows that it has been drawn up under the inspiration of designing persons. Colonel Phayre, however, without making any enquiry from me, at once ad dressed me the above letter. This letter is enough to show the spirit in which the Resident acts towards me. Such proceedings on the part of the Resident cannot but have the effect of encouraging the turbulent propensity of such a class of Mahomedans and disloyalty generally. These two instances, which I have taken as representative ones, can hardly give an idea of the harassing and vexatious treatment I am at present receiving at the Resident's hands. This attitude on the part of the British representative has naturally become a source of serious anxiety to me, especially as in such times persons are not wanting who for their private ends take advantage of ihis state of things, to misrepresent me and to instigate continuous resistance to my autho rity among my subjects. The result will be a great loss of revenue this year, and a continuance of the unsettled state of the minds of the people. How seriously this state of affairs must embarrass and obstruct me in my intended reforms it is not difficult to conceive. Your Excellency knows well the extent and nature of the work before me, and I owe it to myself and those whom I have engaged for that work to submit how hopeless any efforts on my part would be if Colonel Phayre were to continue here as representative of the Paramount Power with his uncompro mising bias against me and my officials. I beg it to be understood that I do not impute other than conscientious motives to Colonel Phayre. But he is too far committed to a distinct line of policy and to certain extreme views and opinions, and he naturally feels himself bound to support all and everything he has hitherto said or done. He makes no allow ances. He forgets that till the officials I have asked for come, I could not make much progress in the mehals; and continues to lend a ready ear to com plaints against me—thus defeating the very object which he says he has in view of helping in the arduous task before me. Colonel Phayre has been my prosecutor with a determined and strong will and purpose, and that he should now be made to sit in judgment upon me is, I must submit, simply unfair to me. From only three months' experience it is clear that he has prejudged the case, and I cannot expect an impartial report from him. I leave myself into v 85 22Your Excellency's hands. Your Excellency has asked me to stake my all on this trial, and I must therefore request Your Excellency^to place me in a con dition in which I can really have the fair trial Your Excellency has given me. I mav mention here that I have made some progress in the various reforms recommended bv Your Excellency, which will be communicated to Government in due time. As to what I have already done and what I propose to do in the matter of the claims contained in the Commission Report, and upon which Government have 'iven advice, I shall shortly send in a complete statement. For the reduction' of assessment I have already fixed upon my arrangements, and I am only waiting for the Government officials I have asked for to carry them into effect. As I cannot enter, in a khureeta like this, into all those incidents which make up my present troubles and anxieties, I request that my Minister be permitted to visit Your Excellency with the Resident. I shall feel highly obliged by Your Excellency granting this permission by telegram. I beg to express the high consideration and esteem I entertain for Your Excellency and to subscribe myself, &amp;c. No. 1986, dated 20th October 1874. From—Resident at Baroda, To—-His Higbness the Gaekwar of Baroda. R eferring to my Yad No. 2693, dated 8th November last year, and to the recent ebullition of the discontent amongst the Military classes of the State, I beg to bring specially to Your Highness' notice the accompanying petition received this day from a number of Sindhees, the adherents of Sirdars, &amp;c., some of whom have for some years past taken to cultivation in Your Highness' Mahals in order to obtain a livelihood. Instead of such a desirable mode of providing for superfluous military retainers being encouraged, as it ought to be, it appears from the petition of these poor people that the very reverse is the case, I request therefore that Your Highness will at once order that substantial justice to be done in this case, which has been so strongly inculcated by His Excellency the \ iceroy and Governor- General in his khureeta of the 25th July last. Now that the peace of the country is endangered on all sides, I must beg seriously to press upon Your Highness' notice that nothing short of an imme diate performance of the promises, which you have from time to time made to Government during the last year and upwards, will satisfy His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General that there is any meaning or reality in those promises. Petition, dated Ashin Sood, 9tli A. D. 1874, Sumbut 1930. From— Sindhee Gajee Natua Meeah and 24 others, inhabitants of the villages of Uttersoomha, Khairaloo, &amp;c., under Baroda Prant, To—His Excellency the Right Hon^ble the Governor of Bombay. T hat your petitioners' ancestors being originally the inhabitants of Sindh were brought to this country; the Baroda State by the late Ha mid Jemadar Saheb and afterwards by his son. Amir Saheb, and other Jemadars, &amp;c., during the time of His Highness the late 1st Euttesing Rao Maharaja in Sumbut 1821 (A.D. 1764)—a period of war and trouble for the purpose of the conquest of this country. At this time same of the ancestors of your petitioners died while on duty, or fighting, and others proved of use and service to this State (during their lives). In consequence of which the rights and privileges, of wuttuns were granted to the aforesaid Jemadars in the same way as are enjoyod by the ' Chirunjeers,' or heirs of the 'guddee' or State. In like manner 8087 your petitioners being regarded as entitled to a participation of the wuttuns, lands, and salaries were assigned to them in Guzerat for their maintenance or service. In this way your petitioners, who were foreigners, were retained here as permanent residents of his country. They came into possession of lands by virtue of mortgage, &amp;c., and these acquired lands, as well as their wuttun ones, were continued to them uninterruptedly, and they also enjoyed the rights and privileges till the time of the late Khunderao Maharaj. Afterwards taxes in the shape of Inam Committee, &amp;c., were demanded from your petitioners, and the same were taken by the Wuhiwutdars from some of them by force, which induced your petitioners to go to Baroda to make a representation to the Hoozoor (Sirkar) on doing which the new imposts were discontinued. In the year of Sumbut 1927, on the accession of Ilis Highness Mulharao Maharaj and on the installation of the late Gopal Rao Myral as Dewan, the Inam Committee tax was abolished. Afterwards Nana Saheb Khanwilkur, brother-in-law of His Highness, became Dewan, and he ordered the ' Inam Committee,' together with the other new taxes to be reimposed. In conse quence of these orders the Wuhiwutdars compelled your petitioners to pay the same. Whereupon your petitioners made a representation of their case several times to the Sirkar, but to no purpose. Feeling helpless at this your petitioners were compelled to petition the Resident at Baroda lor redress, and your peti- titioners' master, the Jemadars, also laid most of your petitioners' grievances before the Baroda Commission. Afterwards your petitioners submitted their petitions both to Your Excellency's Government and the Calcutta Government. A copy of the petition to the letter is herewith appended for your information. Notwithstanding this they could not get any redress. Afterwards the Karkhana of the Paga was entrusted by the Sirkar to the descendant of the late Ha mid Jemadar by name Sha Mahomed Mirza bin Radhunmya on his being confirmed in the same; and although he managed it, he did not get the full nemnook from the Sirkar for several years, which was the cause of your petitioners not getting their pay in full. This put them to much distress. It was aggravated by the Wuhiwutdars preventing your peti tioners from reaping the crops of their fields; and Mohsuls were imposed on your petitioners. This necessitated your petitioners to make an application to the Dewan, Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee, who paid no attention to it, nor did he pass any endorsement on the petition. Disappointed at this, your petitioners had recourse to the Resident for redress ; a copy ot this application has been herewith annexed, a perusal of which will convince \ our Excellency of the extent of the oppression under which they are groaning by reason of Mohsuls, &amp;c. It is now nearly seven or eight months since, Mr. Dadabhai Nowrojee has been here, and that he has been exercising the functions of the ' defacto Dewan' since about a month and half or two; Mr. Dadabhai has entrusted the charge of the Revenue and Criminal Departments, with their executive functions, to the new ' Mundullee' (men) of his own selection, and has made a good 'bundobust' (arrangement) for himself and them (by way of nemnook). Although he is repeatedly told by the Resident for giving redress to the ryots of the Baroda State, so as to stop their complaints, he does not do so, as he and the new authorities whom he has invested with power are quite unacquainted with the system of the Gaekwar Government. Nor can he. For it has been customary with the Minister hitherto to hear petitions openly at their own houses, or in the Kutchery, His Highness' Palace, and decide the cases in the presence of the petitioners, which tended to give immediate redress to them. In the present instance the petitioners cannot have personal access to any ot the officials, the place where they sit being in a very secluded locality. 1 urther they have to report to the sepoy near the entrance to give notice of their coming to the authorities; and they are only called up, if it suits their pleasure, to do so. Generally it happens that they have to go back without getting a hearing. In the Durbar also, if the case of any petitioner happens to be called out, the petitioner is only called in, if it suits their pleasure to do;so, or else he is to go back. This necessarily places many persons, whose cases are just, to great advantage. If after all these any one is bold enough to go near the Minister, the latter expresses himself as follows to him:—This is a very large State, and I have a very pressing hard work before me, as I am alone, how can I get through your business? Such is the state of affairs. This puts your petitioners in mind that the Minister being a resident under British rule wants to act the part of an Englishman in this respect, viz., to show his love of working in solitude as Europeans do. But it ought to be remembered that Europeans do hear the petitions of petitioners and do grant them justice, while this man wants only to imitate the manners of Europeans without giving satisfaction to any one. In consequence of this, thousands of helpless people, who have had no redress given them, have been plunged into despair. Your petitioners, however, beg to submit that the only alternative left them is to petition Your Excellency; but although they did so several times, no notice has been taken of ther petitions up to this time. Their case is rendered the more desperate by the circumstances of the new officials being quite unacquainted with the business routine of this State, the latter therefore are unable to help them out of their difficulties. Hence they are afraid to complain at all. For if they do, the Resident does not arrange their matter; and it only exposes them to the risk of incurring the displeasure of the Durbar officials. People of this State are quite unacquainted with the English rules and regulations, and the new officials do always say something about these rules and regulations. It follows therefore that these persons with the dint of their authority and the force of their intelligence can concoct thousands of schemes as of a nature to cause injury to the people. For it appears that Mr. Dadabhai's mission at this Court has been that of simply defending the late Dewan Nana Saheb and the other officials who are implicated in aggrieving the people. These people had in consequence of their grievances applied to the llesident for redress. An inquiry thereupon was ordered to be instituted into their complaints by the Supreme Government, and Mr. Dada bhai's advent was for the purpose of helping to save the aforesaid persons from the consequences of their deeds and to break down the cause of the com plaints. Sincet Dadabhai has been a Dewan, he has not settled a single case. He has also contemplated to impose the obnoxious tax of 25 per cent, on the income of the ' Hucdaree' class of people; while he has completed a very excellent arrangement of securing thousands of rupees for himself and his colleagues. It will be plainly seen from this that he is quite incapable of making satisfactory arrangements in the State so as to keep the people pleased. In order to settle differences, and make a satisfactory arrangement, in the State at present, it is necessary, and your petitioners trust, that Your Excellency will direct the selection and appointment, to the post of Dewan through the llesident, of an able and experienced Kamdar, and at the same time one who is a heriditary servant of the State. He should have the assistance of impartial and just Kamdars in the administration of the State affairs, and the latter being respectable residents of this place will hesitate to do anything wrong; their conduct in reputation being a sufficient ' guarantee,' and these functionaries should arrange all differences according to the Resident's wishes—a measure which will tend to give satisfaction to all the parties concerned, and the clamour will subside. But if Mr. Dadabhai were by dint of his authority to make any arragement for the people, as to him seems best, that would never remove the cause of the dissatisfaction of the people. It will only have the effect of exhausting their patience day by day, and of annihilating the ' Huckdars.' Under such circumstances, your petitioners humbly crave that Your Excel lency will be pleased to take their case (of ' extreme hardships') into your consideration, and order the Resident to make a speedy arrangement for them. Your petitioners have enclosed postage stamps for the favor of an answer from Your Excellency. As your petitioners are now on the ' brink of starvation,' should there be no prospect of a speedy arrangement of their hucks, they 88(SO will be forced in that event, to have recourse to those measures for securing justice which their ancestors adopted in past times; for as the proverb runs: ' It is better for one to sell his life dearly, or with one's head in hands, than to die the miserable death by the exhaustion of one's limbs (feet). Your petitioners, however, have thought proper to make a full representa tion of their case in the hope that it will induce Your Excellency to pity, and also that no blame may be attached to them if in the end they are compelled to adopt such a course.

From—Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To—Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I am directed by the Governor-General in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 19th November, No. 6832, sending a khureeta from His Highness the Gaekwar to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, and of your letter of the same date, No. 6831, forwarding further papers completing the correspondence submitted with your letters of 22nd October, No. 6137, and of 23rd October, Nos. 6159 and 6160, in accordance with the request con tained in my telegram of 11th November, No. 2417P. 2. His Excellency in Council observes that the whole correspondence between the Bombay Government, Colonel Phayre, and the Baroda Durbar, now received, satisfies the Government of India that Colonel Phayre has thoroughly misundei-stood the spirit of the instructions both of the Govern ment of India and of the Bombay Government, and that the duties of Resident at Baroda cannot be entrusted any longer to Colonel Phayre with the reasonable prospect of a satisfactory result. 3. The Governor-General in Council has accordingly deputed, as a Temporary measure. Colonel Sir L. Pelly, K.C.S.I., as Agent to the Governor- General and Special Commissioner at Baroda. Sir Lewis Pelly has received personally from the Viceroy full instructions for his conduct in the very difficult circumstances under which he will assume his duties. The Bombay Government, to whom Sir Lewis Pelly has been instructed to report himself on his arrival in Bombay, are requested to take all necessary steps to invest him with the needful powers to enable him to discharge, during his tenure of office at Baroda, the duties hitherto discharged by the Resident. Sir Lewis Pelly will also be the bearer of a khureeta from the Viceroy to the Gaekwar announcing his appointment, a copy of which is enclosed for the information of the Bombay Government. 4. 'While the Governor-General in Council is compelled to express his disapproval of the manner in which Colonel Phayre has acted. His Excellency in Council fully admits the difficulty of the position in which he has been placed, and the integrity of his intentions. 5. The Governor-General in Council has not as yet received information as to the result of the enquiry into the atrocious attempt to poison Colonel Phayre, which was reported in your letter of 14th November, No. 40P., but His Excellency in Council desires to convey to Colonel Phayre the sympathy of the Government of India and their congratulations upon his escape. This circumstance, however, cannot affect the conclusion at which the Govern ment of India has arrived in consequence of transactions which occurred Ions: 89 v 23before the attempt, that it will not be for the advantage of the public service that Colonel Phayre shall remain longer as Resident at Baroda. G. The Governor-General in Council trusts that the authors of the attempt will be brought to condign punishment; and, if the investigation has not been completed, it will be the first duty of Sir JL Pelly to bring it to a conclusion, or to recommend the measures that he considers to be necessary for that purpose. 7. The Governor-General in Council regrets to have to point out to the Government of Bombay that serious public inconvenience has been caused bv the delay which has occurred in furnishing the Government of India with full information as to their proceedings, and those of Colonel Phayre. The delay is the more to be regretted as the subject was one of first-rate importance, which had been referred by the Bombay Government for the orders of the Government of India, and upon which instructions had been issued by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council. 8. Although the most important communications between Colonel Phayre, the Baroda Diirbrfr, and the Bombay Government, took place in the month of August, it was not till the 19th of November that the Government of India was put in possession of full information of those transactions. 9. The Governor-General in Council considers that the course taken bv the Government of Bombay was not suited to the gravity of the situation, that their notice of Colonel Phayre's conduct, although proper so far as it went, was inadequate, and that it was their duty to have kept the Government of India fully and promptly informed ot everything of importance that occurred at Baroda. 10. During the present critical circumstances therefore His Excellencv in Council considers it desirable that all orders required for the purpose of carrying out the instructions of the 25th July consequent on the Report of the Baroda Commission shall in future be given by the Government of India. Sir Lewis Pelly has therefore been instructed to communicate directly with the Government of India on those matters, forwarding at the same time' dupli cates of his letters to the Government of Bombay. His Excellency in Council will be glad to receive from the Government of Bombay any observations which that Government may desire to make on those communications, and he desires to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the Bombay Government on such matteis especially as alloct the reform of the interior administration of the State of Baroda. 11.
