It will be seen that the Sardar has made two request®* (1) that his offer to lead a rebellion in Seistan should be conveyed to the Government of India and (2) that his position, ' should he flee to British Baluchistan, should be clarified. 3. As to leave these requests unanswered might lead the Sardar to suppose that the Government of India were not altogether unsympathetic, I think that it would be as well for Mr* Tandy to be instructed to convey verbally an authoritative reply from Government. 4. I presume that they would wish the Sardar to be informed that Government cannot possibly countenance any such action against his own Government as the Sardar proposes and that no $ffer of land or assistance of any kind in Baluchistan can be made should he decide to leave Iran; but I should be glad of definite orders on the subject. 6. It would save time if a copy of any orders which the Government of India may see fit to pass on this matter could be sent direct to Mr. Tandy to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch. He will probably not be finally leaving for Birjand until the end of April. 6. I am also sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran under printed letter No. 23. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S LETTER No. DATE RECEIVED 75 .1-5 15-5-1940Report on an interview beteen His Britannic Majesty’s Vice Consul, Zabul, and Sardar Muhammad Amin Khan Nauroi. The Sardar began by emphasising the considerable services which he and his family had rendered to the British and Iranian Governments. He went on to say that his family did not think highly of Afghanistan and did not wish to have dealings with, or become domicilied in that country. He then said that the present Go/emment of Iran had taken away nearly all his land and that he was little more than a prisoner in Zabul. In fact life was fast becoming intolerable and almost any alternative was preferable to further existence under such conditions. He emphasised the authority which he wields among the extensive Nauroi tribe in Sistan, Baluchistan, and Afghanistan and said that they were ready to do any thing against the present Government of Iran which the Govern ment of India might direct. The Sardar labours under the delusion, prevalent in Iran, that the Government of India is only awaiting a suitable opportunity to annex as much of Iran as possible. His proposition, J&gt;ut bluntly, was simply that, granted British support, he was ready to lead a rebellion in Sistan and Baluchistan. 2. I told him that I could not, of course, speak for the Government of India, and could only express ray own private opinion, but that I was certain that the Government of India had no wish to interfere in any way whatsoever in the internal affairs of Iran, nor could I see any likli- hood of British troops entering Iran except as allies to repel an invasion of Iran by another power. He asked that his offer to render all assistance in his power at any time might be conveyed to the Government of ibcxx India. 3 ....2 .3* He then went on to say that the time might come when he would have to cut his losses and leave Iran and wanted to know what his position would be if he fled to British Baluchistan. He could not do it in the impromptu manner of 3. Jama Khan Ismailzai but would take at least 120 camels for his family and followers and their moveable valuables. I said that, as far as I know, the Baluchistan authorities did not encourage Iranian tribesmen to abscond across the frontier as their livelihood afterwards was not always easy to come by in such a barren country as British Baluchistan, and that such men as did abscond were allowed to have no dealings with their relatives in Iran. I said that, if previous arrangements had been made with, say, the ruler of Kalat State, for land to cultivate there, the position might be slightly different, but that even so I did not feel that the British Indian authorities would encourage emigra tion. He asked that I might ascertain the view of the British authorities. I said I would see what could be done and the interview concluded. 4. I should like to offer the following comments on the interview. The Sardar in question was running a considerable risk in seeing me and from his demeanour there was no doubt but that he was in earnest. He is one of the most influen tial Sardar of the Naurois and is a close friend of Sardar Ali Khan Sarabandi and of S. Haidar Ali Khan, Hissam-i-Nizam, both of whoa would probably help him in any enterprise on the lines suggested. S. Nazar Khan Nauroi, who is said to be a youngman of character, made an indirect offer of large supplies of grain a few days ago in the event of their being required by British forces, saying he did not wish to seil it to the Iranian Government (sale to private dealers is, of course, prohibited). I conclude therefore that S. Muhammad Amin Khan is not alone in his views. The two main elements of ....3 of the population of Sistan are Baluch and Farsiwan. Of the Baluchis the Naurois are an important section. Volume I of the Military Report on Iran 1930 gives their numbers at 2000 fighting-men (p. 58), and I believe there are considerable numbers in Afghanistan and British Baluchis tan (see Appendix IA). They cultivate a large amount of land in Sistan, and many villages are populated by them. The Sarabandis are the principle Far4iwan tribe of Sistan numbering 3000 families (Military Report p. 58). Sardar Haidar Ali Khan is a Farsiwan and used to be a man of L V \ considerable property. He still has a large house in Kachain (which village was largely wrecked by floods last year) but is in considerably reduced circumstances now-a-days. 5. The Sardar f s reference to Afghanistan makes me feel that he might, if disappointed, consider making a similar offer to that country. I n this connection it may not be inapposite to recall that only a hundred years ago Sistan owed allegiance to Afghanistan. 6.

Dost Muhammad died in 1867 and Darwish Khan was passed over for the succession in favour of his uncle Sharif Khan, as a result of which the tv;o branches are still on bad£ terms and S. Muhammad Amin Khan's party is not on speaking terms with S. Nazar Khan and his brothers. They both, however, hold similar views about the present Iranian Government. S. Nazar Khan is believed to have been converted to Christianity by Sir Henry Holland in Quetta. S. Muhammad Amin Khan gives The numbers of Naurois in Afghanistan and British Baluchistan as follows :• Afghan Sistan - 1,000 families. British Baluchistan - 2,000 men whose Sardar is one Husain Khan an officer in the Road- Guards at Chahbar, end a relative of S. Muhammad Amin Khan.

The letter discusses and includes a report from HM Vice Consul, Zabul concerning his meeting with the Sarder [Sardir] Muhammad Amin Khan Nauroi of Seistan [Sistan]. The report covers the Sarder’s offer to lead a rebellion in Seistan, Afghanistan against the Iranian Government, a request for clarification on his position should he, his family and followers move to Baluchistan, Afghanistan and the Vice Consul’s response to said offer. The report includes an appendix detailing the background and structure of the Nauroi Sarabandi Sarders, and the Nauroi tribe.The file also contains related correspondence including a letter from William Rupert Hay, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, to the Vice Consul expressing concern over his response and reservations over the Sarder’s motivations. A specific concern is raised regarding a perceived distinction the Vice Consul made in his response, between the Government of India and HM Government, and a letter in reply from HM Consul General addresses and refutes this concern.A subsequent letter from HM Consul General to the Secretary to the Government of India External Affairs Department, Simla, suggests that the Sarder and his followers plan to leave Iran for India soon.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul-General, Khorasan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00033d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
