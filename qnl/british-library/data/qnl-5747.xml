Of course the contractor will require liberal treatment in the jnatter of rates for shipping and landing coal. Here we pay Ps.£/- per ton for shipping coal in the inner anchorage and Ps.£/4/- per ton in the outer anchorage. The charges for shipping include labour for weigh ing\3 weighing and bagging bhe coal, putting it into lighters, con veying to the ship to be coaled, and putting and storing it on board. The charges also include the cost of gunny bags. The charges for landing include lighterage from ship to shore and stacking the coal in the godowns. The contractor here is supposed to have about £00 tons bagged and ready for imme diate shipment.

Here we pay Rs,2/- per ton to put coal oh board a ship. This includes weighing, bagging (cost of bags inclusive) putting into boats boat-hire and stacking into bunkers on board the ship, in Tact it is an inclusive charge. In your estimate you give Ps.1/3/- a ton but this presupposes a jetty and other things. Can you give us the estimated inclusive cost to ship coal, supposing that the jetty and railway etc., are not sanctioned: or until they are built 7 It is necessary, as you know, to bag the coal (and keep about £00 tons ready bagged) to expedite coal- ing / when coal has to go in lighters.

I have no comments to offer on the estimates which hav been framed with the local knowledge of the rates of a labour and prices of materials , and X think that th..y may be accepted unless the Government of India decide to have them prepared by the Assistant Engineer Persia Gulf subdivision. Next comes the question of coaling charges These Major Knox puts down as follows in a subsequent c ommn i c at i on— (a) for ships coaling off Bandar Shweikh 'CO Rs 0. 15. 0 per ton. (b) for ships coaling /// in usual anchorage Rs 1.14. 0 per ton. These rates include weighing and bagging (cost of bago inclusive), putting into boats , boat-hire and stackig into bunkers on board the ship: they do not , however, seem to take into account the wear and tear of the bagbags and tne cost of mending and replacing those m have become unseviceable • I think , thereof re, that Rs 1*8.0 and Rs 2.0.0 per ton would be about the correct rates for coaling in Bandar Bhweikh and in the present anchorage respectively. In Busnire we pay Rs 2. per ton in the inner harbour and Rs 2.4.0 per ton in the outer anchorage. 4 a Tnen comes the question of Establishment Ch Charges. Major Knox proposes 2 watchmen as permanent establishment .and thinks that the duties of tindal ant sfeighman can best be entrusted to the Indian crew of * the Politival Agent’s launch. I do not, hoover, cum- -sidor that it would be feasible to utilize their ser -vices in coaling matters. I doubt whether the crew would be always available for coaling work , as they have their own work !ld the launch to attend to , and t it may r not infrequently happen that the la 1 inch is away when a sjiip has to be caolec. I think therefore that the Coaling Depot should have its own separatepermanent estab 1 isninent , c onsist -mg of a tindal and 2 woignmen. These men should be located at the Depot and act as watchmen as well The rate of pay which may have to be allowed to secure god men may be roughly estimated as follows: 1 Tindal @ Rs 35 per mensem. 2 weighmen (a) Rs 25 each per mensem. The total cost of a Coal Depot at Koweit would t thus be — Ini Mai C harge^;— Rs 35,000, T &gt; ages .•••••••••*• PetTy repairs, etc (say) . Total 1,100 Rs 1,020 per aannmm 80 ' ” The cost of the present Bushire Depot is as follows: — Rent of godowns (1) 2 § Rs 80 pm Rs 960 per annum ' ' ' (2) 5 (d) Krs 220 812 M ' Wages (1) 1 Tindal (q&gt; Rs 20 pm (2) 2 Weighmen [d) Rs 12 eahii^ — 44 per men, 528 u T 1 Rs ;nn®(0 0.7 Bj tnc: transfer of the Depot, to Ko^reit a saving o of Rs 1,200 per annum would be effected in recurring expenditure, and we should be left with the initial c cost estimated for managing the Depot , namely &gt;Rs Rs 35,000. 5. t/ith regard to the construction of a jetty and a light tramway which have been suggested by Llaj j r Knox I fully concur with him that if these projects wr were carried out the coaling arrangements in Koweit w would be placed on a very satisfactory footing, which would no doubt be welcomed by the Navy. The expediency or otherwise of incurring this ex- -penditure now seems to depnd upon the question of the degree of im ortance with which Koweit is likely to be invested in the near future.

Sir r I have the honour to reply to your Confidential telegram^ 68/16 received from Fao on 17th instant enquiring as to storage capacity to be estimated for in designing coal sheds. 2. The figure 7500 tons at which you arrive is correct, but owing to the want of space in Bushire which only admits our storing 3000 tons at a time, we have to get over the difficulty by receiving consignments of coal at intervals during the year. Presumably this is a source of extra expense to the Exchequer and ecohomy would be effected if annual requirements could be despatched in one shipment. At Koweit where you have plenty of room, it will be advisable to give capacity for the storage of the full amount 7500/- tons and Mr. Storrs f bx estimates should be framed on that basis. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.No. C-4Q (Confidential), dated Koweit, the 27th July 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 1978, dated the 20th July 1910, I have the honour to report that Mr. Storrs, Assistant Engineer, Public Works Depart ment, has been over the ground with me and made a survey for the proposed coal Depot at Koweit. 2. In the first place it will be well to state the reasons for selecting the exact spot shown on the block plan, which Mr. Storrs will submit to you in person. When the survey was carried out by the officers of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ” last year, a section on a line N. 42 W. from a point (marked Y on the plan) 159 yards distant north-east of the Sheikh’s coal-shed was given and it was shown that the foreshore from that point became gradually steeper as the Sheikh’s sried was approached. Subsequently His Majesty’s Government decided to make the Sheikh’s shed the centre of the British concession, with its length running N. 60 E. and S. 60 W. Consequently it became unnecessary to take as the boundary between the Sheikh’s enclave and our proposed depot a line more than 150 cubits (75 yards) distant from the Sheikh’s coal-shed instead of 159 yards and running N. 30 W. and S. 30 E. The north-west angle of the Sheikh’s shed proved to give almost exactly the centre on this bearing and all measurements were therefore based on that point. By this means a rather better site than that advocated in my letter No. 414 of the 28th July 1909 is possible, with a maximum variation in level of i*3 feet only and good ground for foundations throughout. 3. After consideration and discussion with the Assistant Engineer the arrangement of the coal godowns shown in his plain was adopted. The godowns are calculated to hold i.oootons of coal each normally—that is if filled to a height of 10 feet above the floor. In case of necessity, each godown can temporarily accommodate with safety another 200 tons leaving 3 feet clearance to the roof. Thus normally the depot will store 7,000 tons and can accommo date a maximum of 8,400 tons under cover. The arrangements in each godown are exactly similar—with a single row of pillars in the centre to support the roof : two lines of ventilating shafts : roof of mud on galvanized iron sheets laid on steel joists: two sliding or rolling gates or doors also of iron or steel. A rough estimate works out to about Rs. 1,40,000 for the seven godowns ; it will, however, be subjected to revision in the prevailing rates for local materials and labour, with a more accurate estimate of which I was able to furnish Mr. Storrs, and this should reduce the above figure. Quarters for the tindal and 2 watchmen were also included in the plan at an estimated cost of under Rs. 5,000. In the whole depot would has been avoided as being expensive to obtain in Koweit, perishable, and liable to assist a spontaneous fire. The buildings as suggested are absolutely fireproof with the exception of the doors and windows in the quarters. 4. The situation of the godowns with reference to each other has been arrived at on the supposition that a small tramway will eventually be laid, and to afford the most efficient and expeditious handling of the coal, whilst leaving ample space for weighing and stacking of weighed bags ready for instant shipment. No estimate of the tramway or pier was made as Mr. Storrs informed me this would be done in the Executive Engineer’s office in Karachi. On the plan, however, a pier with a T-head has been shown extending to the 3-fathom line as most suitable to local requirements. If iron piles are used for this work„excellent foundations in coral rock will be found and silting is not likely to result, whilst the T-head will admit of shallow-draft ships loading coal direct from the pier, and, should lighters be necessary, several could be w'orked simultaneously. It is not recommended that the tramway should be carried along, though it should reach to, the T-head of the pier, for the reason that on this portion it will be convenient to stack a large quantity of coal if urgency in loading is anticipated. 5. My endeavour has been to submit a scheme which shall give the maxi mum of expedition and efficiency in coaling, while bearing in mind that future requirements are likely to exceed the present and so to avoid a design which would not admit of easy expansion at the same time keeping cost as low as possible. 6, Should it be decided to proceed with any part of the work in the curren t or next financial year, l would suggest that I be authorised as soon as possible to collect and stack coral stone on the site gradually, in order to avoid a sudden rise of price, for this material is not easily obtained at short notice and more over is improved by being exposed to the weather for some months before being used for buildings. G. C. B. P., Simla.—-No. 03742 F. D.—23*9-io.—44.—H.C.S.L.The estimate made out by the Aest Engineer for the Kowelt Goal Depot now shows that the 7 Godowns will cost Rs 1*45,247/- an&lt;? the quarters for the Tindal and weighmen Rs 2,654/- • It will be useful to compare these figures against what Isat present paid In huehlre for the coal-depot f s accommodation there* At Bushlre there are 7 godowns whose capacity (assumlg the coal to be stacked to a height of 12* in all of them) works out to 2,815 tons, say 2,806• The cost In rent of these 7 godowns comes to Ra 1,715 nearly per annum (exchange § 55# Kre per cent Rs) • On tills basis the accommodation for 7,600 tons proposed at ccriX' ^ Koweit //// would coin^vte Rs 4,594/- per annum. This sum rs- -presents 3.2 per cent on the estimated capital cost of Rs 1,43,247/- • If built as estimated and planned the repairs on the Kowelt Coal-Depot would not come to anything like this flg- -ure * for the first two years probably not more than 200/- would be required &amp;nd after that a regular budget provision of 600/- to 1000/- should be ample to cover cost of repairs and replacements. If the cost is considered excessive to allosate to one or two financial years I would suggest that in the first instance a beginning should be made with either three or five of the godowno and the remainder added as funds became available. Even with only 3 godowns there would be more accommodationI '&gt; I &amp;&gt;) ^ than la at preuent available In Buehirtf and In any ease there would be conolderable saving in the cost of landing and ehlpplg the ooals to veseela, as has already boen shown In ay predeoeas -or*!® letter Ho 39 of the £2nd January 1908• The cost of the quarters for the Tindal and watohaen has been estinated at Rs 2 # 654/y $ and these would have to be oon- -atructed in any case • S.A.R's suggestion that they wbght be housed in mat-huts would not be workable at Koweit for the de- -po$ is at some cinsiderable distance from the town and unless permanent quarters were provided it would be inpossible^to keep the nen on the epotj moreover mats in the hot weather would hardly be sufficient protection for a permanent staff* Though the intial cost of the buildings may seen large 9 it must be remembered they are of a solid and permanent oharas -ter and our own property f they will be a valuable sign of our predominant position in Koweit, and the working of the depot should be considerably more economical than Bushire as much bvtter natural facilites ezist for ships in the harbour* m % I Eushire 6.9*1910No. of 1910 British hesidenoy and Consulate-General, t\ // Bushiro, September 1910 # A copy of the undermentioned communication is forwarded with compliments to the Political Ageht, Kowait, for information.

'll* Sir, /x. \ x I have the honour to refer to the correspondence on the subject of the proposed CoAl Depot at Koweit, ending with Foreign Department Letter No. 1288-E^.A., dated 21st June 1910. 2. Under instructions from his Department, the Sub-Engineer on duty in the Persian Gulf has since visited Koweit and worked out plans and estimates for the coal godowns, together with plans for the proposed jetty and light tramway, on which estimates will be prepared in Karachi. I enclose a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Koweit, No. C.49 dated 27th July 1910. { explaining Mr. Storrs* proceedings in consultation with himself; also a copy of the plan showing the arrangement proposed for the shed and jetty, which has my approval. 3. The fact that accommodation for 7500 tons has been estimated for instead of 3600, the amount taxon into calculation by Major Knox in making his tentative proposals and endorsed by me in my letter No. 912 dated 22nd March 1908, needs some explanation. L I beg reference to paragraph (1) of the ’’Memorandum about Bushire Coal Depot” enclosed with the communication just quoted. It is true that the average annual consumption at Bushire is about 3000 tons, but the fact that by the rule of ’’established proportions” onkJ on tho basis of which the Bushina Depot is worked, wa are directed to maintain 2-J- years supply in order to be prepared for emergencies was not sufficiently taken into account. In Bushire owing to the impracticability of obtaining sufficient accommodation for 7500 tons, the difficulty has to be got over by our receiving our coal in frequent small consignments; but this is both an expensive ar rangement to Government and a troublesome one to this Beeidoncy, and therefore in opening a new Depot where we have plenty of room, it seemed advisable that an estimate on the 2^ years supply basis should at any rate be placed before (xovernmant. Mr. Storrs was accordingly directed to prepare his plans and es- h© timates on the latter basis and this/has done; but the accommodation has been designed and estimatod for in such a manner*(by providing 7 sheds to hold about 1000 tons each) that the Government of India can proceed with the project pircemeal as it were according to the probable requirements of the near future, from time to time. 4, Having regard to the tentative estimates submitted by Major Knox in 1908, I fear the Government of India may find the present pro- prosals somewhat formidable, as the cost of the 7 godowns works out to If 1,43,247/- and the quarters for the coaling establishment to ft 2,654/-. Total H 3 1,45,900. On the basis of the rent paid in Bushiro for the accommodation of 2800 tons coal, viz, if 1715 per annum, the sum which would have to bo paid for renting accommodation for 7500 tons works out to 4594. By building the Depot now proposed, Government will thus be saving an amount which represents 3.2 per cent on their capital outlay of R 5 1,43,247. Regarded as interest on capital outlay, this may not seem a handsome return, but even with 3 godowns to start with, more accommodation would be provided than is at present available at Bushire; and in any case, there should be a consider able saving in the cost of the landing of coal and the coaling of ships, as was pointed out by Major i^nox in his letter No. 39 dated 22nd January 1908. Moreover the buildings will be of a solid and permanent charac ter and will be valuable evidence of our predominant position in Koweit. For these reasons I very much hope that the Government of India willwill be pleased to consider the project favourably. 5. The only items in regard to which, as a layman, I venture to think economy should be possible, are:- (1) Foundations. Deptft could perhaps be reduced. (2) Doors. Cost seems excessive. (3) Ventilators. Wood might be substitited for iron. I havo forwarded a copy of this letter to the Sub-Engineer for submission to his Department with the plans and estimates and they will no doubt address the liovernraont of India on the subject in due course.

With reference to the correspondence ending with the endorseenclosure iio.l. Admiralty to India Office. With reference to your letter of the @th November 1910 relative to the proposed Coal Depot at Aoweit, I am commanded by the Dorda Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will inform the Secretary df btate in Council that they a note that it is intended to maintain in the Depot/stock of coal equivalent to 2jr years* consumption. 2. Coal is liable to rapid deterioration in a climate sucn as that of the rersian Gulf, and to ensure against this risk the Admiralty practice, in cases where it is desired to main tain a stock of fuel in excess of a year's turnover, is to keep a stock of coal equivalent to about 1 year's expenditure, the balance of the reserve being patent fuel. The stoc^ of patent fuel is completely turned over about every 8 to 10 years. It is suggested that this procedure might with advantage be brought to the notice of the eovernment of India. I am. Sir, your obedient servant. za/- C . I. Thomas.Proposed Goal Depot at ivoweit. The proposed Goal depot at hov/eit is on far too preten tious a scale. It is not necessary to provide for the storage of more than 3000 tons at the outside and the ordinary amount of coal that should be Kept there should not exceed 2000 tons. 2. The turnover of coal would then take about twelve months which is the extreme limit that tfelsh coal should be Kept in this climate and even coal of this age will have lost 50/£ of its calorific value when it comes to be used. 3. The Admiralty have recently ordered a coal shed for Golombo to contain 20,000 tons, it consists of steel uprights and girders with corrugated iron roof and is of a thoroughly practical nature. There are no sides but the coal is kept from being stolen by an unclimable fence 7 feet high. I have no doubt that the same Gontractors would supply a similar shed to the same drawings, only of the size necessary to contain 2880 tons stacKed 10 feet high, at a proportionate cost. This would probably not exceed £14,00 withthe necessary fencing. I consider this type of shed far preferable for the storage of coal than the x&amp;b sheds designed. it is considered quite satisfactory at Golombo v/here there are heavy rains and strong winds for at least six months in the year and therefore in a dry climate like that of ivoweit there can be no question as to its giving sufficient protection from the weather. 4. With regard to the pier, I do not consider tliat it is necessary to provide a deep water pier to deal wjth the coal of this depot. The amount is so small that the expense would not be justified. I would, therefore suggest a short rubble pier to extend below low water marx and alongside the end of which there should be 8 feet at low water. The pier should slope so that the outer end should be 2 feet above the water levee, at low water and the inner end one foot above the water level at high water. It may be constructed of any convenient material, rubble o^p piles, and should be about 20 feet wide on the platform at the@0 \pV the shore end, tapering to notless than 10 feet at the outer end. Lighters would be able to lie alongside this at any state of the tide and the coal would be carried to and from the shed by coolies. 5. The location of the shed should be /ithin about 40 or 50 feet of the shore end of the pier so as to minimise the distance that coal has to be carried. 6. A snatch is attached showing the proposed arrangements. 7. An establishment of this nind with quarters for the Staff would probably not exceed £3000 to erect. This is less than half the proposed coot and would amply provide for all the necessities of H.M.Ships and the xioyal Indian Marine Ships in the Northern part of Persian Gulf. 8. If it is considered advisable to erect the larger pier for political reasons, than I would point out that the present design will require considerable modification. The proposed pier which is only suitable for working coal or light cargo, does not extend far enough out into deep water to enable it to be used by ordinary Merchant vessels or by H. M.Ships at all times of the tides. There would be at least £6 feet of water at the pier head at L.W.O.S. otherwise vessels will be obliged to haul off every tide. The pier head should be sufficiently long to enable a collier to lie alongside and work all her holds if quick discharge is required. For this purpose it should be increased to 300 feet. 9. I do not consider it necessary to provide a pier for the working of such a small amount of coal as it is proposed to store at koweit and therefore, if the expenditure of public money xx on it is to be justified, it should be os such a cha racter as to take ordinary heavy merchandise and to cope with the regular traffic of the Port not only now but also in future when, if the terminus of the Baghdad Railway oomes to be at koweit, the trade will be largely increased. It could then be used as the landing place for all goods and a small wharfage due1 due would help to cover the money laid out on it. The existence of such a pier would enable us to 'withstand any proposals to erect other worxs or quays and would help to keep the control of the Trade in our hands, but in order that we should be able to ta^e this lino, the pier must come up to the following standard at the very least (a) It should have 26 feet of water at the head at L.W.0.S . (b) The ”T” should be large enough to berth the entire length of a ship. (c) The pier should be strong enough to carry a moving load of at leas£ 13 tons, i.e. 10 tons plus truck, tare 3 tons; or standing load of 20 tons. (d) There should be a 10-ton crane provided at the pier head so as to facilitate discharge. (e) A Railway line with necessary sidings, is addition to the light railway for coaling, should be laid so as to connect up eventually with the Baghdad Railway. It appears, however, that all that is necessary to be done at present is to complete the requisite plans and have everything ready to proceed with the construction directly the main ques tion of the location of the Terminus is decided. 10. vVith regard to the general question of Indian Govern ment coal in the Persian Gulf, I am sending in a separate letter. (Signed) ^dmond J.vV.Slade, Rear-Admiral, Commander-In-Chief's Office, Bombay, 31st March 1911.I /'■N 3 . ^r? Telegram - P. From - Resident, Bushire. To - Foreign, Simla. No.401. Dated Bnd May 1911. The Marine authorities had laid down a basis of 2j- years’ supply as a maximum, for calculating the amount of coal to be stored at Bassidore and Bushire depots, and it was on this datfiL/ that noweit’s requirements were calculated, it being considered that it was merely a case of transferring the Bushire depot there. Plans, however, specifically contemplated that accom modation would only be built in accordance with actual needs Tj and 3000 tons per annum was given as the present consumption It will be seen from my letter fto.955, dated May 5th and subsequent papers that my recommendations as to style of depot were influenced by the fact that at that time use of lien jam was not practicable, and that it was politically important to consolidate our position at avoweit. In regard to these two considerations the situation is now altered, and it would now appear that all that is required is that the practical coaling needs of the navy should be met as cheaply as possible. As the Admiral’s proposals both in regard to the sheds and pier promise to be cheaper than ours, I suggest that they should be subjected to examination and estimate by the P.W.D. In view of the fact that the question of the status of xioweit and the terminus of the railway is lively to be decided at any moment Government will doutless consider whether it would not be better to suspend final consideration till result of negotiations are iinown. fto risk seems lixely to be attached to such a postponement as we have a lease of Bunder Shwaikh. I concur as to advisability of placing in charge of the depot a special staff detailed by the Marine.

The question progressed very deliberately until 1910-1911 when the aggressive attitude of the local Turkish authorities in regard to various points at issue with us in the Gulf in dicated the advisability of the early accomplishment of the project as one means of strengthening our de facto position at Koweit. In January 1911 howevey,specific negotiations commenced with the Porte with a view to a comprehensive adjustment of con flicting interests and it was considered by His Majesty’s Foreign Office in April 1912 that if we were to commence ex tensive building operations during the progress of the Koweit, the correspdence regarding which on my record ends negotiationsMi &gt; r I ' negotiations, the Porte might have grounds to object to our proceedings, as constituting a modification of the status quo.

The arg^uments in favour seen to be (1), A saving in expenditure. It would be unnecessary to engage almost tiie wi^ole of the staff aeolaed upon, and to erect the buildings for tuexa. Tne amount payable to O.P.as commission on nlid 3000 ton basis would at the most amount to £100 a year, and more than this sum would be saved. Wr The desirability of having all boat ana coolie arrangements in the hands of one body, vie G.P.&amp; Go, to avoid the trouble arising from clashing and competition. (3), The desirability of minimising the numbers of a staff whose employment in limited to an average of two or at most three days in the month- (A) ,. Any advantage there may be in encouraging Gray Paul &amp; Co.

Please communicate the following to Public Works Department. Eeference to your letter No. 38-C of September 1st. It is reported by the Political Agent that the plan of the coal depdt at Koweit was returned to the Executive Engineer, Karachi, on September 3rd. Kindly expedite the matter.” Letter from the Superintending Engineer, Indus Eight Bank Division, No. C.—33, dated 5th November 1911:— “ With reference to Government Memoranda Nos. C—24 and C—28, dated 29th May 1911, and 14th June 1911, respectively, herewith returned with accompaniments, and to the correspondence ending with Government Memo randum No. C—44, dated 6 th October 1911, I have the honour to forward amended plans and estimates, the latter amounting to Ks. 51,601, for the proposed coal shed and pier at Koweit. “ 2. The plans and estimates have been prepared generally in accordance with the wishes of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief as contained in the copies of the Memos attached to the Government Memos. 3. The figure quoted by His Excellency as the probable cost at which the shed, pier, and quarters for the staff, could be erected was £3,000 or Es. 45,000. This figure is exceeded in the present estimates by Es. 6,601, the excess being due to certain alterations suggested by the Political Agent, Koweit, in his Memorandum accompanying his No. C.—57, dated 29th August 1911, copies* attached, and to superior construction provided for the quarters for Establishment. Differences in rates, prevailing at Koweit and Colombo, also account in part for the excess. “ 4. Some of the alterations suggested by the Political Agent have not been carried out for reasons detailed below :— (а) Two cook rooms, 111' x 8 ' each, have been provided, one for Hindus and the other for Mahomedans, instead of one cook room, 12' x 12', as suggested by the Political Agent. The Executive Engineer states that, even if Hindus are not employed as Lascars, the partition wall between the cook rooms would be useful for different sects. ( б ) The slope of 1 in 22*85 suggested by the Political Agent for the Pier is considered too steep for men with heavy loads to use continuously, especially over a length of 250 feet. A slope of 1 in 25 has accordingly been provided. “5. The ‘superior construction’ referred to above for the quarters for establishment consists of masonry walls, with roof of corrugated sheets covered with mud, instead of galvanized steel and wood as suggested by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief. The latter construction, if adopted, would render the quarters uninhabitable during summer, owing to the excessive heat. “ 6 . The roof scantlings of the coal shed have not been reduced, as suggested in the Naval Commander-in-Chief’s No. 880—II, dated 1st June 1911, as the shed will have to withstand a wind pressure of almost equal intensity as at Colombo, consequent on the heavy 4 Shamals ’ which are prevalent up the Gulf during certain seasons of the year. “7. The office copies of the plans have been countersigned by the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, in token of his approval, except sheet Nos. 2 and 7 pertaining respectively to the Pier, and Establishment quarters, which required modification in accordance with the suggestions of the Political Agent. As these modifications have been carried out as far as was possible, there seems no necessity to return the papers to the Political Eesident for counter- signature, especially as they have been expedited by Government. “8. In conclusion, I beg to invite attention to paragraph 3 of the Political Agent’s No. C—57, dated 29th August 1911, in which he recommends, for reasons stated, that the pier should be completed before the arrival of the iron work for the coal shed.” Memorandum from the Political Department No. 8869, dated 13th November 1911 “ Forwards copy of a telegram from the Government of India, Foreign Department, No. S.—678, dated 11 th November 1911, enquiring when the plans of the coaling depot at Koweit may be expected.” ; Kot printel14th GoVem “ ent ot foreign Department, No. 236-T. of H 5—2 CON *(1) Coal shod (2) Fencing including 8 gates, each 10 feet wide (3) Quarters for establishment ...

Sir, I have the honour to reply to your letter No. C.oO of 27th August 1915 regarding the location of the Coal Depot. 2. Shaikh Mubarak has been here but did not broach the quest ion except to this extent that in a conversation with Shaikh Khazal and myself, he mentioned incidentally how ready he al ways was to accommodate his interests to those of Government, and quoted as a recent instance his readiness to meet your views &amp;n the above connection. 3. As we can produce no document that he has seen which de monstrates the contrary, we cannot effectively dispute his contention; and it seems to me that as long as we have our jetty somewhere in the space which the sectional profile shows to be the most suitable strip in the Concession, it is of no great consequence if all the buildings connected there with are constructed to the east of the Pier instead of part to the west and part to the east, i.e. your alternative (l). If, hov/ever, this is inconvenient from the point of view of the Engineer in charge of the work, I see no objection, supposing that the sectional profile at the point selected is practically the same, as I gather from you is the case, to the most westerly of our buildings being placed where tne pier site now is, and the site of the pier itself being shift ed 30 yards or whatever the necessary distance may be, to the eastward. 4. I leave it to you, in consultation with the Engineer official in charge of the work, to select whichever of these two alternatives seems most convenient from our point of view. Your,1 i' I ?

Gray Paul &lt;x Co., on the terms suggested therein, instead of having a regular Government Staff, 1 have no remarks to — offer as to the desirability or otherwise of the proposal, more especially a*' you will be responsible for the correct receipt and issue of coal at that port. I would however point out that, although in para. 5 of your letter you state r,hat I essrs. Gray Paul will not accepTr any responsibility in regard to the returns or coal received and issued, still they propose in para 5 of their letter dated 19th April 1915 to charge Annas four per ton for supervising the worlt / I have the honour to be.

The ^rcvi?i&gt;n of labour and lighterage will be arranged be tween this office and the Shaikh's customs,, and this question is favourably affected by the prospect of the customs coming unuer our management at no dit tant date* I Lave, moreover,, an addition al reason for urging the modification of the crigiuol scheme in txie fact that a large saving both in initial and recurring ex penditure will be effected at a time when the neeu for retrench ment hae uoen specially impressed upon us*5.

You will ooBerve from* previous correspondence that a. chiej. reason for the elaborate arrangements at first proposed lay in the desire to consolidate our political position in Kuwait, an I need not point out that our position here is now too well assured to require the suggested oonsolidatron.. 7. - I may add that I discussed the proposed modifications with Six p.Cox in connection with the proposal of Messrs Gray Paul &amp; co, and that the proposal was referred to the Director X.

At what stage is the question of the Kuwait coal depot? All the correspondence about this has been between Political Agent Kuwait and yourself and the last thing I have on the subject is Colonel Grey’s letter 35-C. dated 17th November 1915. After this the Assistant Engineer told me that the contractor and men had finished the pier and were waiting drawing pay and doing nothing on account of some proposal not to build quarters; on the strength of this I sent my wire 1352 fLated 11th December 1915. The reason I am now writing is that during the last four months a lot of big transports have been to coal here, and on nearly every occasion thousands of pounds demurrage must have been wasted because a hflWrling shamal started and prevented coaling for days together; we had three or four large transports all here together once. It seems to me that a great deal of this wastage would be obviated if the Kuwait Depot were working, as I believe shamals do not have so much effect at the coaling anchorage there. • I may mention, however, that the Commodore Persian Gulf is opposed to transferring the whole depot from here over -there. A depot there for heavy draught ship^ and a small depot here^chiefly for ships which can get into.the inner anchorage,would be best^^ .

Servants* quarters stopped by Political Agent though materials collected. Revised estimate for coal shed and fencing received and will be submitted shortly.” Letter to the Government of India, Marine Department, No. C.W.—8338, dated the 10th August 1916, as under:— “ With reference to my telegram No. 6143-T. of the 14th June 1916, I am directed to forward herewith, for sanction, two abstracts of revised estimates for constructing— (1) a coal shed, and (2) fencing at Koweit, together with a recapitulation and two com parative statements. It will be seen that according to the revised recapitulation the total cost of ‘works’ amounts to Rs. 1,00,071 as against the original sanctioned estimates amounting to Rs. 51, 601 and with the addition of Rs. 1,501 on account of Tools and Plant charges the amount of the revised estimates stands at Rs. 1,01,572. I am to observe that no provision for Establishment has been made in the estimate as the Accountant General reported that the Establishment in the Persian Gulf being Imperial will carry out this work which is also Imperial and the net charges under this head remain at debit of the head ‘ Establishment ’ under ‘ Imperial ’ and are not distributed over individual works. The provision for Tools and Plant is, however, necessary as all the tools in the Karachi Buildings District are Provincial and credit will have to be given to that head by per contra debit to Imperial. “ 2. The increas ed cost is due to the enormous rise in the price of cement and iron work, particularly the latter, and the high cost of carriage and labour due to the war conditions in the Persian Gulf. In consequence of this excessive rise in the cost of the work the Governor in Council suggests, for the consi deration of the Government of India, that unless these works are of extreme urgency they might stand over for the present. If, however, the fencing is con sidered imperatively necessary it could be constructed this year. “ 3. I am to request that the orders of the Government of India may be communicated at an early date, as there is a provision of Rs. 35,000 in the current year’s budget of Imperial Civil Works.”2 Letter from the Government of India, Marine Department, No. 1410-M., dated the 1st November 1916 :— “ I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C.W.—8338, dated the 10th August 1916, forwarding abstract of revised estimates for the construction of (1) a coal shed and (2) fencing at Koweit, in connection with the proposed transfer of the coaling dep6ts from Bushire to that place. 2.
