The Shaikh is much disturbed at present over t^e probability that the 'Iraq Government is going to cl.allenge his title to a portion of his ?ao estate; and also that they are going to claim revenue - possioly even arrears of revenue - on his property on the Shatt al-'Arab.

His Excellency tie Hi h Commissioner is a..so aware that exemption from taxation cannot be given except by law (vide article 92 of the Organic Law), I have perused the correspondence which has taken place on this su 1 . ect, and I agree with my predecessors that the promise cannot be regarded as bidding on the 'Iraq G-ovenlr.ent. In t lese circu. istances I re jst thi t I am unable to prepare and submit, to Parliament a law prov ic ing for these exemptions.

Your Excellency will remember tnat in .x,Javidson T s letter ::o.P.0.75 dated the 17th of April, 1924, to your address, it was stated that I felt sure that the T Iraq Government would reco nise this obligation as a de }t oi honour, but that the .atter could be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two Governments, It thus appears that the question is one which should be properly discussed with Your Excellency, and not primarily with the Ministry of Finance. I e,m reaay to discuss it at any time convenient to Your Excellency. Before do in so, however, I wish to express a doubt as to whether His Excellency the inister of Finance has correctly stated the bear in of tie Organic Law upon the matter. From previous correspondence with the Ministry of Finance I have understood that they have held that under Article 90 of the Organic Lav/ the ^raq Government is precluded frbrn varying except by law the rates £it which taxes were ' eirr collected from any particular lake's at t' .3 ti. * of V 3 proivul . tion of the Organic Law. For instance, when I enquired recently the reason why the revenue demand on the Hot ibn liajim in Diwaniyi h w .s only 25/o of the produce4 I was informed that the G-overnment demand had been/■ a i—T~ i been specially reduced to 25% on this land in the days of the British Occupa tion o.nc that un er uhe Or&gt;nic Lrav it could not now be enhancec except by a special law. I have received similar replies from the Ministry of Finance in other instances. It i ppears to :-e . ere ore that, as t % 3 date xirdens of t 'e Shaikl.s of --o'. ra and Kuv ( r ait 7 r ere exempt from the payment of revenue a^ the time of the ;roi .ul Ration of ^-.e Organic Law, thc ^fl must in accordance with Article 90 of the Organic Law continue to enjoy such exemption until a revenue demaniis specifically imposed on them a new law anc .hat the le ^al exemption required by Article 93 of the Crganic • Law has been alreac y conferrec on tliem by Article 90. Your Excellency will perhaps wish to consult the legal advisers of the ^raq Government upon t -iis point before continuing the discussion. I am causir. a copy of this letter to be sent to the . inistry of Finance., I remain, etc., . (S :c.) H.DG3BS. His Excellency Ja'far Pasha al 'Askari, C.M.G, President of the Council of Ministers, Be ' ;dad.. 1927. The Government he.s hitherto abstained from collecting revenue, in t' is case )y reason o 1 a romise made by the British Government in consideration of certain acts at that time not cone, but presumably subsequently executed as a reec . I do not find that the promise gave rise to any ri :ht • bicn b; t' e 'Law of 'Iraq tb-en in force could be termed a le ; 1 ri ;ht to exemption. Before the Constitution, the G-overnment, if it had deciced to collect the revenue could have cone so without the neec for special legislation revoking the promise.. That, I think is c ear and as no special law has been passed dealin with t':is case it .:'o--lo?/s ohat after t .e Constitution tne G-overnj.ent is entitled oO collect the revenue without jecial le islation. If it is argued that the 'Constitution prevents Government from collecting the revenue without special legislation, then it ..iust then be ad mitt x that Article 90 of the Constitution operated so as to give legal force to acts w' ic 1 ' had no le al force before, and that, I consider, woulc be far ..Tom the intention Of/i ' 1 . of the article. Article 90 is, in nr^ opinion, no more than a ; eneral valication of existin legal enactments overnin' taxation. If it is asked why such i validation is needed there, in view ofjbhe articles regarcdn_ the validation of laws, then the answer is that it is not really necessary any more than Article 102 is necessary in view of Article 26(C) but tie financial clauses were drafted so as to stanc by themselves. I am of opinion that it would be better for this exemption to be supported by law but, at the sane time, I a: - not convinced that t: .e G-overnment could be * justly accused of an unconstitutional act if it continued to abstain from collectin the revenue. Certainly the G-overnment could not be so accused in the case of a person exempted by the rules of International Law or by International agreement althou; h there be no special law permittin ; such exemption, anc the same considerations mi .t, in ray o union, be tvop'.iei to the exceationel nature of the present case.

EXERTION OF THE SHAIKHS OF KUWAIT A.HP tfflHMM] ■ MIR I FEES . iN TR THIS PREJUDICE TO 'IBAQ^ RIOHT TQ DISAPPEAR? (By our Travelling Correspondent). Negotiations are in progress now in London oetween British Grovernment authorities and leading 'Iraq statesmen, headed by His Majesty the King, in regard to certain outstand ing question between the two allied states and to the removal of cerlan suspicions which are felt from time to time as a result of certain points of difference being still left witnout satisfactory solution. It is an estaolished fact, over which no two persons can differ, that it is a matter of first class concern to ooth parties that there should disappear irom the field anything that is calculated ta leave the aoor open for the entry of tne self-seekers to raise dislike and dissension oetween the two noble nations. This can only be achieved uy a friendly settlement of outstanding questions, based on conviction and not on the dictation of terms by the stronger party. In the belief that this friendly spirit will permeate the atmosphere of the negotiations between Britain and 'Iraq, we wish to discuss one of the questions which the 'Iraq continues to urge and which remains without solution. We think that we are doing well in inviting attention to the settlement of this question in which gross injustice has been done to 'Iraq and an evident encroachment was made upon her rights - so evident that we do not think the British Government will pass by un noticed. The question is that of the continued exemption of the estates of the two Shaikhs of Kuwait and iulo hammer ah from miri fees. About seven years have lapsed on the establishment of the National Government in 'Iraq without the said governmentgovernment receiving a single farthing on account of miri lees in respect of the extensive estates of these two Shaikhs, on the grounds that the British Crovernment of Occupation had promised the two Shaikhs to exempt their estates in Basrah from miri fees. These fees are assessed annually at 12,000 Liras (Turkish gold). Accordingly the total loss to 'Iraq up to date, on account of this exemption amounts to some 100,000 Liras. In foregoing this consideraole sum the already poor treasury of 'Iraq suifers an undoubted loss. In addition to such loss, there is to be taken into account the prejudicial effect on the independence of 'Iraq of the compulsory exemption from lees of certain estates, a thing which rising 'Iraq cannot in any way tolerate. When the budget estimates were submitted to the Chamber of Deputies at the last parliamentary session, H.E. the Minister of Finance (in reply to the violent criticism directed to him in connection with this exemption which is derogatory to 'Iraq's sovreignty) stated that discussions on the subject were in progress between the 'Iraq G-overnment and H.E. the High Commissioner. In the meantime the Minister of Finance referred to the assistance which the British G-overnrnent claimed to have been rendered Dy the two Shaikhs to the British Expeditionary Force in 'Iraq during the Great War - assistance which the British Oovernment thought at the time fit to reward by the exenption of the Shaiicns' estates from miri fees. Assistance might have been rendered unheard of and unnoticed on our part because those who rendered it happened to be, say, in the wilds of Airica; out Kuwait and Mohaumerah being so close to 'Iraq and at only a short distance from Basrah, we cannot possioly remain ignorant of any assistance rendered Dy these two dependencies to the British Expeditionary Force, as we were close to all and we witnessed all the military operations and political activities which took place in Mesopotamia. On the other nand we happenr to know of certain acts on the part of the two ShaiKJis which proved exceedingly narmful to the movements 01 the British armies, so harmful that in 1916 the British Authorities were compelled to declare a land blockade on Kuwait exports. What is the nature of the assistance rendered by the two Shaikhs? We do not think that Great Britain will be able to disclose the nature of such assistance, since there has been nothing of the sort. On theotner hand, so iar as we are aware theltwo Shaikhs did not render the ieaso assistance to the British Expeditionary Force. On the contrary they offered resistance to that lorce. Snaikh —ubarak As-Sabah would not allow the military transport ships which carried the 'Iraq Expeditionary Force over from India on the outbreak of the war to lay anchor in his country. Neither would he allow the Kuwait to be used as a coaling station lor the British fleet in the early days of the war. On the other hand, is there any one in 'Iraq who aid not hear at the time of the enormous smuggling of goods by Kuwait tor tne Turkish armies in 'Iraq, Syria and the Hedjaz - that illicit traae of which even the Kuwait Grovernment authorities were suspecteaj Granted that we can lorget all this, can we ever forget tne deplorable attitude of the two Shaikhs towards the Arab rising undertaken by His Majesty Hussin ibn 'Ali against tne Turks for the liberation of the Aiabe trom their bondage, towards which rising they did not show the least sympathy and railed to recognise its lawfulness in audition to tnair laiiure to lend it any support whether moral or material, and that in spite of the British efforts exertea in that direction'.' These are some of the acts undertaken oy the Kuwait dependency during the Great War. No doubt they were narmful to the Military Expedition in 'Iraq. We do not know of any assistance rendered uy Shaikh Mubarak As-Saoah or nis successors. As regards the Shaikh of Mohanmerah, it is surprising to claim that he had rendered any assistance to the ^itish lorces, inasmuchv@ inasmuch as w© know that wh6n the British G-overnment directed its military expedition against Basrah the Shaixn's suojects were in a state of rising against nim, and he was only able to maintain his position in Mo hammer ah thanks to the protection afforded nim by the considerable British forces which were dispatched to repulse the attacks of the bedouin Arabs on Nasiriyah and Amniyah. Hence it is surprising to saadle 'Iraq with demands of false gratitude to even the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, now a prisoner in Persia, and to ask for a reward to them while they have not rendered the least assistance to 'Iraq out, on the contrary, their territories have benefitted by theexisting state of 'Iraq. In the meantime the dangers which nad been threatening them oy the existence of the ottoman Government in 'Iraq have been removed. Assuming that they had rendered any assistance to the British forces, it is up to the British Cxovernment to reward the two Shaikhs oy some other means and not at the expense and in the name of 'Iraq, since they nave not rendered the least service to this country which iias undertaken to liberate itself from everything that savours of interference in its affairs. For the foregoing reasons we consider that the British Grovernment 1 s persistence in preventing the 'Iraq G-overnment from levying of miri fees on the estates of the two Shaikhs is illogical and contrary to the wishes of Or eat Britain which require the extension of assistance and support to 'Iraq. We hope that this injustice to 'Iraq will be removed in the course of the present negotiations. Tnis should not prove difficult to accomplisn.c ^ It is requested that in any further communis ■ '* ^ation on this subject the under-mentioned letter and number may be quoted, and the reply addressed to— The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, ^ London, S.

The correspondence referred to in the India Office letter quoted by you dealt with the possibility of exerting pressure on the Shaikh of Kuwait by threatening to dis- continue the remission of tax on his date gardens covered by the assurance given to him in 1.14. In 1920 the local authorities considered, ana the Government of India agreed, that the assurance of remission was unconditional and the threat to withdraw it impracticable. 3. The Earl of Birkenhead, for his part, shares the view of the Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed in paragraph 5 of your letter that there appears to be no ground on which His kajesty's Government could adequately justify the discontinuance of 'the immunity from taxation hitnerto accorded to the two Shaikhs. He is however, ascertaining the present views of the Government of India on the point and also on the course which might be followed if it should L jrove finally impossible to persuade the Iraq Government to continue the exemption from taxation at present enjoyed by the Shaikhs. A copy of the letter which is oeing sent to the Government of India is enclosed. 4. In the meantime Lord Birkenhead aesires to express his concurrence in the views and pro ^osals contained in paragraph 4 of your letter and would be glad to see their /•3 acceptanceoecret. iL. 4422/4047/65. 3^ / 3 .W.I. 3rd November 1927.

Sir, , u ,I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain ^ to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ITo. 40157/27 of October 27th on the subject of the assurances given by His Majesty's Government in 1914 to the Sheikhs of Lohammerah end Koweit, regarding the immunity from taxation of their date gardens on the then Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. He has also received a 'copy of India Of f ice ' letter IIo.P.4557 of October 18th to your Department on the subject. 2. Sir Austen Chamberlain strongly concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 5 of your letter llo. 40157/27 of September 2lst, and in paragraph 3 of the above-mentioned letter from the India Office, that there is no ground upon which His Lajesty's Government could justify the disconti nuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to these two Sheikhs. It is, in Sir Austen Chamberlain's opinion, not open to question that the.undertaking given by His Lajesty's Government in 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit was intended to apply in perpetuity, and that the exemption ./as a reward for assistance which the Sheikh actually gave to His Majesty's Government and was not dependent on his future conduc t. 3. From recent unofficial correspondence with Lajor- General Sir Percy Cox, the Secretary of State considers tnat it is equally clear that the undertaking given in 1914 to Sheikh Kazaal of Lohammerah regarding his date gardens on what was then Turkish territory was intended to oe of perpetual application, and that the exemption was accorded inj Of in return for services actually rendered, and was not dependent either upon the Sheikh's future conduct or upon his future relations /1th the Persian Governiiient• 4, The answer to the question contained in paragraph 6 of your letter, whether the Sheikh of Liohani—i.ers.ii or his 30ns do in fact still derive any bene! it. irom the inuiiuni ty from taxation accorded to these date gardens is in the af j . iriiiative I am.

My dear Oliphant, A v r L J 'U-t qi 1 ' In your letter to me of the 2nd of December you raised the question of the advisability of insert ing in the revised financial Agreement a provision to cover the question of the Date Gardens of the Shaikhs of ohammerah and Kuwait, i 'or my part^ I should be against giving such prominence to the question, if any other way of safeguarding our position could be found. You may remember that our commititent in this matter was specifically referred to as one of our 'interna tional obligations in respect of Iraq H in the memoranduir on that subject which was communicated to Ja^far Pasha officiaHyat one of our formal meetings with the Iraqi ^Delegation, Article 3 of the revised Treaty reads *' His ajesty the King of Iraq undertakes to secure the execution of all international obligations wMch His Brit «*nic ajesty has undertaken to see carried out in respect of Iraq'. As you will remember, the Iraqis asked for a detailed statement of our international obligations and the memorandum referred to above was con.inJinicated to them in response to this request. They have not up to date questioned the contents of that menoorandum; and, if as it to be expected, Ja*far Pasha signs the draft Treaty without raising this point, we should be justified, I think, in assuming that they accent the Statement of our internat onal obligations (including the reference to our comndtments to the Shaikhs) as authoritative. In that event, it seems to us tnat the immunity from taxation promised to the Shaikhs will become a Treaty obligation of the Iraq Government and it would be unnecessary to cover the ground again by means of a provision in tne revised Financial Agreement. I am sending copies of this correspondence to Fass and Wakely. Yours etc. L.Ollphant, Esq. C.M.G. (Sgd) J.E.Shuckburgh. i3. ; C CH ?1 Dl !! ^ IAL . lio. 40-: • of 1928.

I shall be glad if /ou will, at a suitable opportunity, infor the Iraq Government accordingly, and endeavour to induce them to agree to continue to accord of the two Sheikhs immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens in Iraq. Foe this purpose, you • ill no doubt make such use as ..ay be possible of the arguments aduced in Colonial Office letters of the 2lst of Septemberrcr*-- .... , . v . i Septernbe-' la'at, and also, if necessary, rer-ind the Iraq • { Govei nj.-iei:t t.iat the Financial Tlissiun, which visited Iraq in u.925, recor.jiiie]:ded, in para# VIII of the /.poendix to their xepoi &gt;, t l ia•- tjie Ire u Government s/iould honour tUe undertakings v,liich had been n-iven by His Majesty* s Governi;.er t to the Sheikhs of Llohammerah and Ku/wait. The Ira,^ Govern; :er, t - ve not hitherto, so ar as I am av/are, given any express intiiaa- tion of their unwillingness to accent that recommendation. 4. If the Iraq Government are prepared to honour those undert m icingsj_ but are doubtful ol their ability to persuade the Iraq Parliment to pass trie necessary legislation it Vvill be for considerauion whether King Feisal should not be requested to pass an Ordinance,^in accordance with Article 26(3) of the In, Constitution, to rive effect to these undertakings. For the reasons stated in the second paragraph of this Despatch His Iiajesty's Government consider that the fulfilment of these undertakings may be regarded as a treaty obligation on the part of the Iraq Govermnent which that Government may be called upon to fulfil under Article 4 of the Treaty of the 10th of October 1922, or under Article 2 of the New Treaty when that instrument enters into force; but it would clearly be preferable if the Iraq Governmen could be induced to honour those undertakings without the necessity of invoking the articles of the Treaties to which I have referred above. I hav e etc..British International Obligations in respect of Iraq. The principal international obligation of Great Britain in respect of Iraq is the duty imposed by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, viz. that of rendering advice and assistance until such time as the country is able to stand alone. The 'Treaty of Alliance' between Great Britain and Ira i.e. the Treaty of 1922 plus the Protocol of 1923, and the subsidiary Agreements of 1924, was accepted by the Council of the League of Nations in September 1924 as giving effect, together with certain complementary undertaken s by the British Government to article 22 of thu Co^en?nt. If fallows,therefore, that the whole of the terms of the Treaty of Alliance must, under existing conditions, be regarded as part of the interna tional Obligations of Great Britain. Indeed, in the first of the complementary undertakings referred to. Great Britain explicity assumed responsibility, towards all members of the League of Nations who might accept the treaty regime, for the fulfilnent by Iraq of the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance so long as it remained in force. The complementary undert'.kings of Septe .ber 1926 included:- (1) The conclusion of special extradition agreements on behalf of Iraq; (2) The sub.dssion of an annual administrative report to the Council-of the League, and (3) The reference to the Hague Court of disputes v.ith other members of the League in regard to the fulfilment, interpretation or ajplic; tion of clauses in the Treaty of alliance# witn he implied undertaking that the decisioi. of the Court would be accented and executed. These three undertakings must also be regarded as part of the international obligations of Great Britain in respect of Iraq. Special reference should be made to Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, wi.ich provided for the conclusion of separatesexj^rate agreements to secure the execution of any 'Treati agreements or undertsJkings, v/hich Great Britaan is under an obligation t. see carried out in ^espect of Ira_, Our obliga tions under this article v/ere further defined in 1926 by an exchange of notes between the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister of Iraq. By a'decision of December 1925 (dealing with the question of the northern Frontier of Iraq) the Council of the League of Nations stipulated that the regime, established by the Treaty of Alliance and complementary undertakings should be continued for a maximum period of 25 /ears. The requisite extension of the duration of the Treaty was provided for by the /nglo-Ira ^ Treaty of January 1926. In submitting this Treaty to the League, the British Government reaffirmed the undertakings given by them in 1924 and engaged to discharge them throughout the extended period contemplated in t e ne^ Treaty. The Treaty of 1926 is thus a further international obligation of Great Britain. In delivering their award on the Frontier question the Council of the League, besides stipulating for the conclu sion of a new Treaty betv/een Great Britain 'and Ira^, invited the British Government. (l) to submit to the Council the measures to be taken in order to secure for t e Ku.dish popula tion 1 of Iraq certain guarantees in respect of local administration. and (2) to act as far as possible in accordance with certain other suggestions (principally in regard to the treatment of minorities) made in the report of the League Commission of Enquiry which had visited Iraq.in 1925. His Mahesty* s Government have reason to understand that the League of Nations regard them as under an obligation in respect of these two points. The nature of our international obligations in any nev treaty must necessarily depend upon the terms of the treaty itself. If the existing instruments defining our relations with Iraq are revised, the revised instruments will have to be submitted to the Council of the League for acceptance as giving effect, &gt; ' ■ 1 f ■' r effect, un ier the altered conditions, to the provisions of Article 22 of the Covenant. Once they are so accepted everything that the/ contain, together with an/ complementary' undertakings on the rmrt of H .L.G. that may accompany them, will become an international obligation of Great Britain, the treaties of 1922 and 1926 being superseded. The above sets out what may be described as the legal, or technical asx^ect of the case. For practical purposes, it nay be safely assumed that the provisions of the Treaties, etc., ore not all of equal importance in the eyes of the League•• j Certain of those provisions have sires dy becoi e obsolete;other are mainly of domestic concern to Iraq. To the moditication * or j^on-continuance of such provi iont theie is no reason to suppose that the League would raise objection. What the League will mainly be concerned in safeguarding are those provisions which:- (1) may be regarded as essential for ensuring the continu ed progress of Ira^ in the direction contemplated by Article 22 of the Covenant; and (2) have a definitely international aspect, 's affectinr the rights of foreign nations or the general interests of civilisation. Apart from these obligations of a more general character there ere certain specific assurances regarding the position of Italian nationals in Iraq given t_ the Italian Government under the correspondence v.ith the Italian Ambassador in April 1924, cox)ies of which were co^imunicated to the Iraq Government in Mr. Bourdillon's letter to the Iraq.Prime Llinister of the 30th of June 1925. This Memorandum would not be complete without mention of a further and inor British obligation in raspect of Iraq, with which the Iraq Government are already fully familiar, namely, that entered into with the Sheikhs of l:o hammer ah and Kowait, who in November, 1914, were promised, in return for their assistance in the earlier stages of the War, complete imi unity from taxation in respect of their Date Gardens in the Basrah Vilayet. For the reasons explained in Llr.Davidson* s letter to the Prime llinister of Iraq dated the 17th of April 19241924, this obligation was not specifically mentioned in the Exchange of Notes under Article X of the Anglo- Iraq Treaty of i922, but His Majesty^ Goverrn-ent consider thf t the Iraq Government have iniierited this obligation, and with it the duty of ensuring that it is fully discharged.•o ,V5 Gonf idential• ff 1I0 .782-N/27. iinpNCV. &gt; ■ y »/• Ri% No Tr.^.

I have not mentioned this conversation to the fthaiith of Kuwait. nince the decline in his Cuotoias receipts caused by Bin Sand's action, the shaikh relies largely on the revenue from his Iraq gardens to keep up his posi tlon. There is of course no question of attaching the gardens themselves, but the question raised relates to Government tax on them. This amounts, I believe, to over one lakh annually. cJl.n.

A /o SoS 'S o(. /o &gt; /o '2 7.63214/29. ^ 25 August 1929 Sir, 1 I am directed by Lord Passfield to refer to the etter from this Department of the 14th of March, No. 68214/29, and tc transmit to you, for the consideration of the Secretary r.Iraq of State for India, the accoapanying copy of a further despatch B.8.7/29 . from the High Commissioner for Iraq on the subject of the exemp tion from taxation promised to the Shaikhs of Kuv/ait and Mohammerah in 1914.* 2. It will be seen that Sir Gilbert Clayton enquires in paragraph 4 of the accompanying despatch whether the exemption i accorded was intended to be personal to the Shaikhs or to attach to their property and thus pass with their property on sale or transfer. In Lord Passfield* s mind there appears little ground for doubt that the exemptions were not intended to attach to the property as such, but to be personal to the Shaikhs and to their successors. He will be glad to know whether this view is also held by Mr. Wedgwood Benn. 3. Sir Gilbert Clayton raises two other main points in his despatch (l) Whether the undertakings entered into with the Shaikhs could properly be regarded as an international obligation on the part of His Majesty's Government for the purpose of their Treaty engage ments with Iraq; and (2) whether those obligations can properly be discharged by means of lump sum payments by the Iraq Government to the Shaikhs. As regards the first point, the position is not altogether clear. By Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, the High Contracting Parties undertook to 'conclude separate agreements to secure the execution of any Treaties, agreemen ts— Agreements or undertakings which His Britannic Majesty is under obligation to see carried out in respect of Iraq*. It was subsequently decided to proceed by means of an exchange of notes instead of by separate agreements. By an oversight no mention ol^the undertakings to the Shaikhs was included in the notes exchanged, and as the note then addressed to the Iraq Prime Minister purported to set out in full 11 the Treaties,. Agreements and undertakings' referred to in Article 10, it would, in Lord Passfield*s opinion, be difficult now to argue that this particular undertaking was covered by that Article. As Mr. Wedgwood Benn is aware, an\ attempt was made during the negotiations of the Treaty of 1927 to overcome this difficulty by including mention of these undertakings in a note, setting out in full the international obligations entered into by this country in respect of Iraq, which was presented to Ja'far Pasha in the course of those negotiations. As, however, there is no immediate likelihood of the Treaty of 1927 enter^ing into force, th^fiote presented to Ja'far Pasha would appear to lose much of its value, pairticularly in view of the fact that, as Sir Gilbert Clayton points out in his despatch, the Iraq Government have never specifically admitted the accuracy of the statement of international obligations contained therein. 4. It would seem therefore unsafe to attempt to rely in this matter upon Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922. But it would appear open to His Majesty's Government as an alternative to fall back upon Article 4 of that Treaty. This Article provides that ,f His Majesty the King of Iraq agrees to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty, tendered through the High Commissioner, on all important matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Britannic Majesty for the whole period of this Treaty'. The undertak ngs to the S^ikhs could. Lord Passfield considers, reasonably be described as an important matter affecting the international and financial obligations of His Britannic Majesty and thus a matter upon which the Iraq Govern ment are under Treaty obligation to be guided by the advice of■ ^ ^ I am, His Majesty's Government. Subject to the.views of Mr .Wedgwood Benn, Lord Passfield would propose to inform the High Commissioner accordingly, and to authorise him in the last report to inform the Iraq Government that His Majesty s Government regard this as a matter upon which the Iraq Government must be guided by their advice, e On the second point Lord Passf^ld is disposed to agree with Sir Gilbert Clayton that, if the Iraq Government can be induced to offer a lump sum in final settlement of the Shaikhs' claims for exemption from taxation, this would provide an eminently satisfactory solution. He would, however, be glad to be favoured with the views of Mr. Wedgwood Benn on this suggestion. 6. A similar letter is being addressed to the Foreign Office. Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Treasury. Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) O .G.R.• Williams./ m ■7 0 The Residency, SECRET B . Baghdad, dated 8th July,1929. My Lord, I have the honour to refer to despatches of Your K Lordship's predecessor Secret dated the 11th of June, 1929, and Secret A dated the 13th of March, 1929, on the subject of the exemption from taxation enjoyed by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah. 2, The situation, in so far as the Iraqi Government is concerned, remains as described in Mr. Bourdillon T s despatch Secret D dated the 19th of August, 1927, and there is little doubt that, if the Council of Ministers were to introduce a law exempting the two Shaikhs from taxation 'in perpetuo' and thus involving the Treasury in an annual loss of revenue of approximately 1% lakhs of rupees, there would be a strong opposition in Parliament and the bill would probably be thrown out. 3, Another course would be to force a reluctant King and Cabinet to pass an ordinance under Article 26(a) of the Organic Law. ^n ordinance passed in accordance with the nrevisions of that Article would not have to be submitted to Parliament, provided it were passed for the purpose of securing the fulfilment of an obligation arising out of a Treaty 1 app roved b y Parliament or by the Constituent Assembly , but in x any case it would be published and would become the object of criticism levelled against the Cabinet and possibly even against the King himself. 4. There is much to be said for the Iraqiii point of view ' * r. on this question. Quite apart from serious financial consi derations, the granting of perpetual exemption presents many obvious disadvantages and might in certain circumstances lead to an awkward situation. For instance, is the exemption to be considered personal or would it pass with the property on sa]e or transfer ? I presume that it would be personal, but even1921 % 7% in that case the benefits would in course of time be split up by inheritance among many collateral descendants, in the event of the Shaikhs ceasing to be rulers as is in practice already the case in regard to the Shaikh of Mohammerah. While it is true, therefore, that the obligation entered into by His ^lajesty* s Government exists, I venture to think that it would not have been incurred in its present form if it had been possi ble at the time to envisage its implications. 5. Before initiating action on the lines of paragraph 3 of this despatch, I should be glad to know whether it is still certain that the obligation can be dealt with as an interna tional one which Iraq is bound under treaty to take over, now that the proposed Treaty of 1927 is no longer being proceeded with (in this connection see paragraph 2 of Mr. Ormsby Gore's Secret despatch dated the &lt;36th of January 1923). It is possible that the Iraqi Government might contest this point and request arbitration by an impartial authority. It is true that obligation was defined as an international one in a note presented to Ja'far Pasha during th^ course of the negotiations which took place in 1927, but the Iraqi Government have never, as far as I an awa^e, acknowledged the obligation, which was not included in the list presented to them in connection with the Treaty of the 10th of October 1922. 6. It is also worthy of consideration whether a more satisfactory course of action might not be to seek a way of extinguishing the Obligation once and for all on terms which would be fair to the Shaikhs. This mi r 'ht be d^ne by means of a cash payment based to some extent upon a certain number of years purchase of the annual payments involved. Up to the present date, the sum of the annual exemptions granted amounts to R s . 11,27,413-12-0 in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait and R s .4,90,235-0-0 in that of the Shaikh of Hohammerah making a total of Rs. 16,17,653-12-0, or £.121,323. Of this total the sum of R s . 10,12,126-10-0, or £.75,909, has been remitted sincey&lt; © 1921 inclusive by the Iraq Governrfient, anci 6,95, 5^7-2-0, oi £.45,414, by the Military Administration during the years 1914- 1920. The present annual value of the remissi-n is R 0 .1 ,09, 590 to the Shaikh of Kuwait and K 3 . 40,933 to the Shaikh of I ohammerah. 7 4 reasonable cash settlement might prove attractive to the Shaikhs and a better chance of a satisfactory settlement of this tiresome question might be afforded by approaching the i h ' ii Iraq Government on the basis of a final cash payment, rather tnan that of perpetual exemption. 8, i should be glad to have your instructions in ':he li^ht of the observations put forward in this iespatch before I approach the Iraqi Government further in the matter. I have etc., v (Sd) Gilbert Clayton. High Commissioner for Iraq. The Right Hon'ble Lord Passfield, P.C., Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London,^.4./ .1^ P5361/29. |0- 24th August, 1929. Sir, U I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Williams's letter of the 15th August, i.o.68214/29, relative to the exemption from taxation of their date gardens in Iraq guaranteed to the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Mohammerah in return for their co-operation against the Turks in 1914. 2. Mr. Benn agrees with Lord Passfield that the exemption then afforded was not intended to attach to the property, as such, but to bt personal to the Sheikhs and to their successors. 3* On the first of the two main points raised in Sir Gilbert Clayton's despatch, and examined in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Colonial Office letter u; der reply, Mr. Secretary Benn agrees with the course of action proposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. As regards the second of those points, he sees no objection t the issue of instructions to the High Commissioner to sound the Iraq Government as to their willingness to offer a lump sum in final settlement of the claims for exemption from taxation of the two Sheikhs affected. In this connection, however, I am to invite attention to ^the demi-official letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Sir Denys Bray dated 4th July,1929, j 0 3 ■ i;o.240-3, of which copies have already been sent to your Department from which it appears that the Sheikh of Koweit, since the decline in his customs receipts caused by Ibn Saud's action in imposing a customs embargo, relies largely on the revenue from his Iraq gardens to keep up his position. It is possible, in these circums tances, that some difficulty might be experienced in persuadinr the Sheikh to agree to surrender his exemption, save in return for financial concessions which the Iraq Government w.uld be reluctant to give, and it is relevant that the present annual value of the remission amounts in the carse of Koweit to over a lakh of rupees. - ^,n A/ Confidential. 7/ 7if- Wo. b07-:3. of 1929.

S.W.I. i5th Septeiaber x929 Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secreta enderson to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 68214/29 of August 15th, dealing with the subject of the exemption from taxation promised to. the Sheikhs of K#weit and Mohaniicrah in 1914 in respect of their date gardens, and asking for the views of the Secretary of State as to the procedure which fVald now be adopted by His Majesty's Government Vis-a-VI2 the Ira^i Governnent to secure that due effect is-given to this under taking. 2. Since the matter was last discussed, : r r. Henderson's attention has been drawn to tue following aspect, which as far as he is aware, has not yet received consideration. The Sheikh of Koweit is an independent foreign sovereign. The IraqwG-overnment in comion wit i all ot ier governments, are s. obliged by international law to treat him as such. Under international law a state is prohibited fro-: exercising jurisdiction either over an independent foreign sovereign, or 4 his property* This being so, and the Iraq^Cr'overnment being precluded by international law from exercising any jurisdiction over the Sheikh of Koweit or his property, it would not seem possible for them to tax his property, for, if they attempted to do so, they could not legally enforce their taxation, either by taking proceedin^jagainst the SheiKh per sonally, jr by measures taken against his pr)perty. v ithority for the application by the English courts of the principles of international law conferring immunity fro i the jurisdiction of the property of a foreign sovereign is to be found in the cases of Vavasseur v. Jru ^p and the Ju.jlt^r .'o.I and the sibject is discussed fully in Dicey* s Conf--ict ofLav/a iTourth edition p^es 208 At seq. Gases such as l.Tighell v» The Sultan of Joh^re and The Duff Development Company v. The Govern :er:t of T'e lantan show that tiie rulers of snail )rotectecl native states are entitled to all the immunities of independent foreign sovereigns. 3. Before considering further the question discussed in your letter under reference, or going into the other points raised therein, ] T r. Henderson will be glad to receive Lord Passfield^ observutijns on the .^rj l ei-t de /el':ped in the preceding paragraph. He realises that tne argument coixLd not be applied to tne case of the Sheikh of Lloha nine rah who is a Persian subject; but, in.3:iuch uij tue property of the Sheikh of Koweit is the ;iore valuable, and the question of its exemption from taxation would to that extent seem lilcely to present the greater difficulty, he thinks that the argument is deserving of careful consideration. 4. I am to make it clear, however, that, in LIr. Henderson's opinion, the pledges given by His Sujesty 's Government to the Sheikh of Ttoha imerah are no less binding than those given by them to the Sheikh of Koweit. While therefore a solution of the question of the Sheikh of T 'ov;ei t* s exemption on the lines suggested above would reduce con siderably the dimensions of the problem and the Amount of money involved, it will still be necessary to fii.d a satisfactory issue in so far as the Si.ei.wh of 7 'oha iimerah is concerned• 5.

Sir. j.-p I am directed by LordJ^asafield to acknowledge tho receipt of your letter of tlie 13th of September, No. ii 4052/ 1358/93, regarding the exemption from taxation promiBed to the Sheikhs of Koweit md Uohanmorah in 1914 in respect of their date gardens in Iraq, and to request you to mfona Ir. Secretary Henderson tliat His Lordahip is advised that tiie position in this matter of the Sheikh of Koweit under international law is as stated in your letter. 2. Lord Paasfield is advised, however, that in this country the question whether a person is an mdepandant sovereign is decided by a atatefnont by a responsible minister that His Uajesty rtico^nises him as such, and thit a statement of this character is regarded as conclusive evidence by the Courts. It may be that in Iraq a similar procedure would have to be followed, and that a statoment by a responsible Iraqi uinistar that King ^aisal recognised the Sheikh of Kcweit as an independent forei-p sovereiji would be necessary in order that the Sheikh^ property should be removed from th&lt; jurisdiction of the local Courts. If so, it is not thought likely that King Faisal would decline so to reco^iise the Sheikh of -oweit; but the possibility should not be entirely excluded from consideration. 3. ^ven if, however, the Iraq Government were prepared to apply to the Sheikh's case the principles of international law explained in your letter, this mijit not, in certain circumstances, provide a complete and lasting solution of the difficulty. The undertaking given to the Sheikh in 1914 applied not only to himself, but also to his 'descendants'. Consequently, if the Sheikh's property were divided/ THS UNIER S3CRSTARY OF STATE, FOREIGN OFFICS.5./ divided among his children upon his death, Hin Lajesty's GoTemment would appear to be mder an obligation to ensure that they enjoyed axeraptiion from taxation in respect of the date gardens in Iraq, althougn they clearly could not all be independent soverei^s and thus entitled to irnraunity under international law. As r. Henderson is aware, the terms of the undertaking gifen to the Gheikh of Koweit were as follows:- in ^ your gardens shall remain^our possession and in possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue or ta2e8. ,, Lord Passfield is not aware i?hether any particular si(jiificance need attach to the use of the word 'descendant#' instead of the wore usual term &lt; '8•acce8Bor8 , •. r n a strict interpretation, the undertaking given ^ould seam to bind Hia iiajesty^ Government, in the event of a chanf'? of dynasty in ^loweit, not only to secure for the Sheikh nnd his descu.danta immanity from taxation in respect of the uate gardens in lrM\ 9 but also to preaerva th ^t property in their undisturbed possession. 4. Despite tlioae posBible difficulties^ however. Lord Pa «aael&lt;1 is of opinion that the application of the principles of international law should provide at least a temporary solution of the difficulty m so far as the date gardens of the ohaikh of oweit are concerned, and, subject to the concurrence of ilr* Henderson snd of tiie Secretary of Ctate for India who is al^o bein^i consvilted, he proposes to instruct the Acting Hi{^i CoHtiissioner for Irar^ to explain to the Iraq Government the position of the oheikh of Koweit under international law, and to invite thorn to agree that, in the circmstances, they have no option but to accord the Sheikh immunity from taxation in respect of his property in Iraq.5. As explained in your letter the argument from international law could not, however, be applied to the case of the Sheikh of rohiinmerah, and it will still bo neoeeeary to deviae measuree to ensure that the similar plocit.es oi immunity from taxation given by His ! ajesty's Government to the Sheikh of Uohamaerah are duly earned out. 'ith this object in view. Lord Paasfield proposes to instruct the Acting Higji Ooranission'sr to reconmend to too Iraq Govemmont thfit they should attempt in negotiation with tne ;iieikh or his representatives to tonainate his exertion from taxation by a lump sum payment as proposed in Sir Gilbert layton's dosnatch of the eth of July, If, however, the Iraq Government reject his prooosal, or if they would attempt, to negotiate such a settlement with the Sheikh and fail, it may still prove to be possible in connection wiUi the negotiation of the proposed new treaty with Iraq to induce the Iraq Government formally to assviae on behalf of liis Majesty's Government the obligation towards the Sheikh.

The revised figures show that the present annual value of the immunity is Rs, 78^202-4-0 to the Shaikh of Kuwait and Rs. 29,04i-8-0 to tne Snaikn of Mohammerah. i'he other figures given in the despatch also require correction and I, therefore, attach a detailed statement showing the amount of taxation remitted in each year since 1914 to 'both Shaikhs.

Baghdad, 15th October 1929. Bear Young, The quettion of tjhe exemption of the date garden • of the Shaikhs of Muharamerah and Kuwait from taxation haa been the aubject of correspondence between the 'Iraq Government and Hla Excellency the High Commissioner since the early days of 1924. The ♦Iraq Government had considered and continue to conaider that this exemption is illegal and that its continuance requires a special law under article 92 of the Organic Law. At the same time the ^raq Government considered that the promise for exemption given to the two Shaikhs in question by Colonel Knox, the (then) British vwYV Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf could be held to be binding on the ^raq Government. Hence the said Government have seen no juatification for aubmitting to Parliament a draft law for the legalisation of this exemption. This question is not included in (or does not come within) the undertakings which His Britainic Majest/s Government is under obligation to see carried out in respect of 'Iraq under article X of the Anglo-'Iraq Treaty of 1922. On the other hand, the ♦Iraq Government believe that the exemption enjoyed hitherto by the two Shaikhs is a sufficient reward for the services rendered by them in the early days of the war. Aa regards the Shaikh of Kuhammerah in particular, though he en joyed a measure of quasi aelf-Government he was daemed a Persian subject and did not possess the quality of independent ruler (Amir). Assuming that he was (then) an independent ruler he has since forfeited all his ri^its and privileges and he no longer poasesses the quality which ha enjoyed when he waa proraiaed exemption. The last development in the question under diacuasion, as may be gathered from previous correspondence, was that in August 1927, the ♦Iraq Government re uested His Excellency the High Commissioner to: approach the British Government once more on the subjectQu subject, and decided to defer decision in the matter pending receipt of the result of Hi a l^xcellenoy the High Conmisaioner' b representa tions to the British f-oyemraent* iln this connection, I beg to invite reference to the correspondence ending with Secretary to the Council of Ministers letter Ko 537 dated 12th December 1928. It appears that no reply has yet been received ft'om the British Government# As, in view of the reasons set forth hereinabove, the 'Ira^ Goveinraent are unable to allow the continuance of the I exemption of the gardens of the two 3haii&lt;h8 from taxation, they have adopted the following resolutions:• (a) The continuance of the exemption is not legally justifiable, b The *!ini8tiy of ITlnance should be directed to issue the necessary instructions to Finance officials for the collection of the taxes in question with effect from the financial year 1930. (c) The two Jhaikhs in question should be informed that hitherto the •Iraq G .vemment have, in so far as it was possible for them carried out the promise given them, and that it is impossible for the 'Iraq Government to continue to carry out the said promise without violating the provisions of the Organic Law. Please accent etc. Yours etc. (Sgd) Abdulmuhsin al-SaMun. His Excellency, Major H.W.Young, C.M.G. ( D.3.e.The Resir eriqy, Baghdad, dated 19th October 1929 Confidential • No*P*0*25B» • 1 Ify Dear Prime Minister t I have received Your Kxcellency •a letter Ko«2466 dated the 15th of October, 1929, on the subject of the exemption of the date gardens of the Shaikhs of ITohainnerah and Kuwait and I have studied all the correspondence that has passed on the subject. I find that, as Your Sxcellency points out, the whole question was referred to His Btitannic Majesty's Clovemnent in August 1927. Although it is true that for various reasons the views of His Britannic Majesty^ Government have not since tkat date been officially communicated to the ^raq Govemmenta Your JSxceiblency must be aware that the question was dealt with during the negotiation of the 1927 treaty o^*- in London and that the obligation to the Shaikhs of Mohanmerah and Kuwait was included in a memorandum containing a list of the British International Obligations in respect of 'Iraq which was handed to Ja'far Pasha This list was compiled in order that the 'Iraq Government might be in no doubt as to the international obligations which His Britannic ITajosty's Government regarded the 'Iraq Government to have assuned. Ho objection was then raised by the 'Iraq delegates to the terns of this memorandum and His Britannic Ha iesty's Government had therefore every reason to believe that the 'Iraq Government understood and accepted their attitude on this subject. When however it subsequently became evident that the 'Iraq Government werre a/^ain challenging this obli.nation. Sir Gilbert Clayton once more addressed His Britannic Majesty's Government on the whole question in a despatch dated July Oth, and further particulars were submitted to the Secretary of State in a despatch flated September 30th« To these despatches a reply is now awaited and in view of Your JSxcellency's letter I have asked the Secretary of State whether the reply can be expedited. I do not altogether understand the final paragraph of Your Excellency's letter in which reference is made to certain resolutions said to have been adopted by the 'Iraq Government. Your Excellency was evidently not referring to formal resolutions adopted by the Council of Ministers as no mention of such resolutions has appeared in any minutes of the proceedings of the Council. I pre sine that Your Excellency's intention was to convey to me the views of the 'Iraq Government and the nature of the proposals which they are inclined to adopt. In any case I am sure that Your Kxcellenqy after reading the foregoing paragraphs of this letter will agree that it is advisable to await the views of His Britannic Majesty's Government, which may be expected veiy shortly, before any action is taken.

His Majesty's Government a^reo that an attempt should bo made to induce the Iraq Government to offer him a lump sun in final settlement of his claims to exemption from taxation.

As regards the Shaikh of Kuwait, you will obsurve from the enclosed correspondence that I am advised that the Shaikh, in virtue of his position as an independent foroi^n sovereign,is entitled, under international law, to exemption from taxation in Iraq. In this country the question whether a pemon is an independent sovereign is decided by a statement by a responsible Minister that His Majesty recognises him as such, and such a statement is regarded as conclusive evidence by the Courts.It may be that in Iraq a similar procedure would have to be followed and that a statement by a responsible Iraqi ITinister that King j «X2isai recognised the Shaikh of Kuwait as aa independent foreign sovereign would bo necessary in order that the Shaikh^ property should be removed from tno Jurisdiction of the local Courts and thus, inso facto . become entitled to exemption from taxation in Iraq. I shall acoordingxy be glad if you will, if you see no objection, explain to the Iraq Government the position of the ►Jhaikh of Kuwait under intemationai law and invito thom to agree that in the circumstances they have no option but to accord to him immunity from taxation in rospeot of his property in Iraq. 4.

I find some difficulty in acting upon the instructions conveyed in your despatch under reference'. Regarding I^ohainmerah from enclosed correspondence it apoears that you regard matter as one which should be dealt with, under Article 17 oi ^reaty but the despatch itself is silent upon this point and the foreign Office having reserved their view I am not clear as to whether Article X or Article 17 is to be invoked. I hesitate to invoke Article 17 as it appears to me that although Article L has never actually been invoked that fact that this obligations were included in the list presented in 1927 to Ja'far Pasha invoked it by implication. In the event of this being so, to invoke Article 17 at this stage would suggest that H.M. Government regard these exemptions merely as their own financial obligation and it might be argued reasonably that it is not the intention of Article 17 to enable H.r. Government to transfer their own financial obligations to the Government of Iraq. A similar argument applies with regard to I oweit with the additional disadvantage that in this case the reply might be that if the Sheikh of Koweit was by international law exempt from taxation in Iraq as an independent foreign sovereign the undertaking iven by H.],'. Goverrment was valueless at the time it was riven. H.1-. Government must, I feel, decide whether these exemptions are or are not international obligations which tne Government oi iraq is bound to implement and must either invoke Article X and if they fail to induce the King and Cabinet to pass an ordinance under Article 26(a) of the Organic Law must be prepared to submit the question to arbitration under the treaty, or if they are not prepared to do this must refrain from exercising further pressurenONFlX'SN TIAL. * pressure on Iraq Government.

(Sgd. ) J. HATHCEH HALL. THE OHDER SECRETARY OF STATE, INDIA OFFICE.11 68214 /89. (a 23 Decaaber, 1929. Sir, I am directed by Lord Passfield to state lor the inl'ormation of Mr. Secretary Henderson that H^.s Lordship has had under consideration telegram Ko.436 of the 4th of December from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq., of which a copy was forwarded to the Foreign Office under cover of Colonial Office letter No. 68214/29 of the 6th of December, on the subject of the exemption from taxation of the date gardens in Iraq, owned by the Shalklis of Mohammerah and Kuwa It. 2. Lord PassfieId is advised tnat the contention put forward by Major Young in that telegram, that the obligations of His Majesty's Government to the Shaikhs of Mohamnerah and Kuwait are covered by Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq. Treaty of the 10th of October, 1923, would be very difficult to maintain. It is not suggested that the obligations of His Majesty's Government to the two Shaikhs are not covered by the general terms of that Article, but the Iraq. Government were Informed in Mr. Davidson's letter Ho. P.0«75 of the IVth oi April, 1924, a copy of which was enclosed in Colonial Office letter Eo.40157/27 of tne 21st of September, 1927, that those undertakings to the two Shaikhs were 'a minor obligation' which it was not thought necessary to allude to in the Notes exchanged under Article 10 (copies oi which will be found on pages 54 to 56 of Colonial No.13, the report on the administration of Iraq, for the period April, 1923, to/ THE UTOER SECRETARY OF STATE, FOREIGN OFFICE.to December, 1924, and that 'in view of the difficulties of settling a matter of this kind at the present juncture His Majesty's Government have decided not to include these ooligations to the Shaildas concerned among the Agreements covered by Article 10 of the Treaty unless the Iraq. Government desires to do so'. Sir Ho Dobbs 1 letter of the 26th of March, 1924, was written for tne express purpose of agreeing as to the Treaties and Agreements covered by Article 10 of the 1922 Anglo- Iraq. Treaty, and the Treaties and Agreements set out in that letter did not include the undertakings to the two Shailchs. In their reply of the 10th of July, the Iraq. Government accepted, as covered by Article 10, the Treaties and Agreements set out in Sir H d Dobbs 1 letter of the 26th of March. Lord Passfield is advised therefore that Article 10 of tne 1922 Treaty must now be construed together with those two letters and that in consequence His Majesty* s Government would find it difficult to argue that the undertakings to the two Shaikhs are covered by Article 10. Nevertheless, His Lordship does not consider that this implies that the Iraq. Government are not bound to give effect to those undertakings. They were informed of their existence in MToDavidson 1 s letter of the 17th of April, 1924, to which reference is made above. In their reply to Sir Ho Dobbs* letter of the 26th of March, 1924, the Iraq. Government did not refer to or take exception to the obligations to the two Shaikhs and as they continued to accord exemption from taxation to the Shaikhs it could reasonably have been assumed at that time that the Iraqt Government recognised their liability to continue to accord such exemption. It was not until the end of 1926, some two years after the ratification of the 1922 Treaty that//a/ (/oi I that the question was again raised 'by the Iraq. Government who then contended that the exemptions hitherto accorded were illegal and could not be continued. In August 1927 the Iraq. Government again stated that the exemptions could not be continued without legislative sanction and that they were not prepared to introduce the necessary legislation lor the purpose® They then requested that the matter should be referred to His Majesty 1 s Government. So At the time of the negotiation of the Anglo- Iraq. Treaty of the 14th of December, 1927 (which has not been ratified or entered into force), the Iraqi Delegates asked for and were furnished with a memocandum containing a list of British international obligations in respect or Iraq.. The promises given to the two Shaikhs of immunity from taxation in respe ct Ox their date gardens in Iraqi were mentioned in the memarandum and no objection to the terms of that memorandum w as raised by the Ira ^i Delegates during the course of the negotiations. His Majesty's Government had therefore, every reason to believe that the Iraa Government were prepared to recognise the obligations to the two ohaikhs, though they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so, or expressly accepted the memorandum as an accurate statement of. British international obligations in respect of Ira a. It was not until the middle of this year that it again became evident that the Iraq. Government were unwilling to honour these obligations. The mention of tnese undertakings to the two Shaikhs in the memorandum handed to the Iraqi Delegation at the time of the negotiation or the 1927 Treaty might be held to have implied that they were in fact covered by Article 10 of the 1922 Treaty although they/ .10^ they had not been specificall^r mentioned in the Exchange of Notes under that Article, but Lord Passfield is advised that Article 10 could not properly be j ( invoked for the purpose ot calling upon the Iraq. Govemmenc to honour those ooligations. He is advised, however, that the undertaking to the two Shaikhs could properly be regarded as covered by the expression 'the international and financial obligations' of His Britannic Majesty in Article 4 of the 192E Treaty and that His Majesty^ Government could properly contend that in virtue of that Article the Iraq Government were bound to honour those undertakings® 4o Apart, however, from any specific Treaty obligation on the part ot the Iraq. Government it appears to Lord Passfield that there are other considerations which alone justify the contention of His Majesty's Government that the Iraq. Government should honour these obligations and which might appropriately be brought to the notice of the Iraq Government. In the first place there is the consideration to which reference is made in paragraph 4 of Colonial Office letter No. 1 40157/27 of the 21st or September, 1927. This consideration was emphasised and endorsed by the Financial Mission to Iraq, in paragraph 8 of the Appendix to their report of the 25th of April, 1925 (see Gmdo2438)» 5® In the second place, in the general financial settlement between this country and Iraq, which was effected as from the 1st of ApriJ., 1921, the Iraq. Government took over all tJ^e assets of the Civil Administration (with the exception at: certain assets derived from military expenditure, vote of credit or Army funds) and assumed responsibility for all civil charges in the future in return for the assumption by His/His Majesty 1 s Government ol' responsibility for the net deficit ol* the civil Administration on the 31st ( of March, 1921. It could thererore 'be contended that the liability to continue to accord exemption from taxation to the two Shaikhs in accordance with the promises made to them on behalf of His Majesty f s Government was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq. Government assumed responsibility in this general settlement. 60 Thirdly, althou^n it appears from Foreign Office letter, Ko.E.6129/583E/65 01 the 10th 01 November, 192b, tnat it cannot be said thau there is any definite accepted rule ol in-cemational law which automatically subrogates a succeeding State to the contractural rights and ooligations of its predecessor, modern usage 01 nations has tended to the acknowledgment of such obligations and His Lordship understands that it is the generally accepted practice that on the transfer from one State to another of responsibility for the Administration of any area the State to which the responsibility is transferred should, in the aosence of any express provision to the contrary, at the same time take over the assets and liabilities attaching to the area in quest iom It would appear, therefore, that it could fairly be contended that, when the responsibility for tne Administration of Iraq, passed from His Majesty's Government to the Iraq. Government, the latter Government, Ipso facto assumed responsibility j.or continuing tne exemption from taxation promised to the two Shaikhs. 7. In all the circumstances, it appears to Lord Passfield that His Majesty's Government are on strong grounds from the point of view of equity, international practice/9./ (lo7 practice and treaty obligations In contending that these undertakings to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq, Government are bound to implement an! he considers that if the Iraq, Government are unwilling to honour these obligations His Majesty's Government should claim that the question should be referred to arbitration under Article 17 of the 1922 Treaty,, 8. There are, however, certain difficulties in the way of arbitration upon which Lord Passfield would be glad to be furnished with the views of Mr.Henderson. Article 17 of the 1922 Anglo-Iraq, Treaty provides for arbitration only as to the interpretation of the actual provisions of the Treaty. It would appear therefore that the only question which could be referred to arbitration is whether in fact these obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by Article 4 of the Treaty. Nevertheless, His Lordship considers that His Majesty^ Government should, if necessary, be prepared to refer this qtuestion to arbitration. He is of the opinion that if the Iraq. Government realise that His Majesty ! s Government are determined if necessary to submit the question to arbitration they will probably be prepared to honour the undertakings to the two Shaikhs, for, whatever ti^ decision of the arbitrator, the Iraq. Government could hardly fail to be shown up in an unfavourable light during the course of the arbitral proceedings. They would probably be unwilling that tne first case, in which they were interested, to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice should be a case which, whatever the decision, would be bound to reflect discredit upon them,,9. Subject to Mr .Henderson 1 s concurrence and to the concurrence 01 the Secretary of State for India, who is aiso 'being consulted on the subject, Lord Passfield i would propose to infonn the High Commissioner tnat His Majesty's G-overnmenc consider that these obligations to the two Shaikhs properly fall to 'be dealt with under Article 4 of the 1922 Treaty, and that he should therefore approach the Iraq. Grovernment once more with the request that they should honour these undertakings which His Majesty's Government regard as Treaty ooligations which tiie Iraq_ Government are 'bound, in virtue oi Article 4 o± the 19 22 Treaty, to implement. The High Commissioner would, at the same time, be given discretion to make such use as he considers fit of the arguments referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this letter and authorised to inform the Iraq. Government that, if they are unwilling to honoor these undertakings, His Majesty's Government will have no alternative hut to claim that the matter should be referred to arbitration under Article 17 oi the 1922 Treaty. Lord Passfield would also propose to instruct the High Commissioner to suggest to the Iraa Government that they should endeavour to effect a final settlement with the Shaikh of Mohammerah by offering him a lump sum in respect of his claim to exemption from taxation. The case of the Shaikh of Kuwait should present less difficulty since the High Commissioner is in a position to invite the Iraq. Government to agree that, in virtue of the Shaikh's position as an independent foreign sovereign, they iiave no alternative but to accord to him immunity from taxation in respect of his property in Iraq.. 10o If the Iraq. Government are doubtful oi their ab ility/# ability to obtain Parliamentary sanction for the exemptions proposed but are unwilling to accord those exemptions without such sanction their attention might be drawn to the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of the letter of the E2nd oi' Feoruary, 1927, from Raouf Beg Chadirchi who, at that time, was acting as Iraq,! Minister of Justice. (A copy ox that letter was forwarded to the Foreign Ofiice under cover or Colonial Office letter Ho. 40157/27 of tne 21st of September, 19271® 11. As regards Major Young 1 s suggestion that the undertaking given to tne Shaikh of Kuwait was valueless when given, Lord Passfield proposes to point out to the High Commissioner that the Shaikh of Kuwait had not prior to tnat assurance been regarded as an independeni; Shaikh but had owed allegiance to the Sultan of Turkey. It is true that after recognising him as an independent Shaikh His Majesty 1 s Government would have been bound to accord to him exemption from taxation in accordance with international usage, but this would not have been evident to the Shaikh by the mere declaration that His Majesty T s Government recognised his independence, and it appears probable that the addition of the assurance of exemption from taxation was considered necessary in order to make clear to tne Shaikh the full extent of the undertaking given by His Majesty^ Government. The full implication oi paragraph 3 of the undertaking given to the Shaikh may not however have been realised at the time when it was given. IE. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will, of course, be consulted before the High Commissioner is authorised to inform the Iraq. Government that His Majesty's Government are prepared to submit this question to arbitration. In the first instance, however. Lord Passfield would/would 'be glad to 'be furnished with an expression of J f Mr.Henderson 1 s views on the course of action suggested above # 13.

Foreign Office 3. W. 1. lOth February, 1930. Sir, I aiii directed 'by !. r r. Secretary Henderson to state that he has had under consideration your letter No. 68214/29 of December 23rd, regarding the exemption from taxation of the date gardens in Iraq, owned 'by the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah, and that he is in . general agreement with the arguments advanced in that letter and with the course of action proposed in paragraphs 9-12 thereof. 2. As regards the difficulties in the way of ar'bitratior to whicb reference was made in paragraph 3 of your letter, and on which Lord Passfield desired the views of Kr. Henderson, the Secretary of State is of opinion that they are not of a nature to deter His Llajesty's Government, should the arguments indicated in your letter fail to convince the Iraqi Government that they are hound to implement the undertakings given to the two Sheikhs, from claiming, that the question he referred to arbitration. 3. Therejare, however, certain considerations entailed hy tbe adoption of this course, to which I am to invite the attention of Lord Passfield. The Secretary of State is advised that , if there is any possibility of this question at some time 'being suhmittea to arbitration or to the Permanent Oourt of International Justice at The Hague, care should he taken in the meantime to make no statement which would prejudice the use of any argument before that Oourt which KHisiia. Counsel on behalf of His Ha^esty's Government might think good to put forward at the time. Consequently er Secretary Of State Colonial Office.; i f Consequently, although rr. Henderson shares Lord Passf'iela'^ view that the argument 'based on Article 10 of the 1922 Treaty has great weaknesses, he considers that care si .ould 'be taken not to abandon this argument, or to say anything which would preclude the use of it at a later stage. i 4. In the second place, it is clear (as stated in t paragraph 8 of your letter) that Eis Majesty's Government, if they were to take the matter to The Hague Court unilaterally, could only do so under Article 17 of the Treaty, and under that Article could only ask for the decision of the Court an the dispute so far as it arises out of the interpretation or application of tae Treaty. The Secretary of jtate is however advised that Eis LaJesty* £ Government should endeavour in the first place to induce the Iraqi Government to submit the question 'by a special agreement, rather than allow the matter to he 'brought 'before the court 'by an unilateral application; and also that in that event an attempt should 'be made to ensure ' % that the special agreement 'be draftea in the wiaest .possible terms, For instance the special agreement might provide for the submission to the Court of a question formed on the following lines 'Are the Iraqi Government obliged, under the provisions of the Treaty of Alliance of 19 22, or under the rules of international law, to continue to accora exemption from taxation to the date garaens of the two Shaikhs, ?' In order to induce the Iraqi Government uo agree to the submission of the question by means of a special agreement, the pride and an our p rox&gt;re of The Iraqi Government night be played on by pointing out that it is auch more in accordance wit. their dignity willingly to subkit the whole question in dispute to the Court (in the manner which under the Optional Clause all the Great Powers have now undertaken or are about to undertake, to adopt, in their relations with each other), than to be forced to appear before the Court by unilateral application under i/I-^ ^ @ unaei- Article 17 of the Treaty in a manner which might even then leave some points of dispute still open. 5. if however the Iraqi Government refuse to make a special agreement, and consequently the case has to he suhmioted to The Hague^ Goiirt hy unilateral axjplication, L'lr, Henderson is aavisea that His Majesty's G -overnment skaKi; should frame their application in general terms with reference to the whole Treaty, rather than confine the themselves to a reference to a single article of the Treaty. 6. Lastly, as the Attorney General has expressed the ■ ■ 1 -thauj l ; uae event* Oi a case in which His Ha^esty's Government are a party 'being referred to the Permanent C;ourt or International Justice, his .directions should oe uarceri as to whether it is necessary for a law Officer to appear. Lord HassCield may wish to consider whether it is desiraule that the taw Officer should he consul tea 'before His Hajesty's Government become committed to referring this case to the Court. In the event of Lord Passfield considering that this course is desirable, I am to suggest that the High Commissioner for Iraq, should receive instructions to the effect that he should not actually * propose to the Iraqi Government a resort to arbitration or to the Permanent Court, until he has referred the question to His Lordship 'by telegram.

Gentlemen^, I ara directed by Lord Passfield to state that he desires to refer to you certain questions regarding the exemption from taxation of certain date gardens the property of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah in Iraq. 1. In November 1914 in order to ensure the assistance of the Shaikh of Kuwait in connec tion with the military operations then proceeding against the Turks in the Persian Gulf a letter dated 3rd November 1914 was addressed by the Resident and His Britannic ivlajesty' s Consul General in the Persian Gulf to the Shaikh of Kuwait in which he was promised inter alia that the date gardens then in his possession situate between Pao and ^urnah should remain in his possession and in possession of his descendants without being subject to payment of revenue or taxes. A copy of the letter is enclosed. On 2lst November, 1914 a letter (copy enclosed herewith) was addressed by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty's Gonsul-General for Far^* to the Shaikh of Mohammerah in which he was also promised that in consideration for the assistance he had rendered to the British Govern ment the date garden he then possessed on the Turkish side of the Shatt-al-Arab should remain in full possession of himself and his heirs and immune from taxation. The date gardens referred to in their letter are situated in territory which has now become part of Iraq.2. On 10th October, 1922 a Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq was signed at Baghdaxi, a copy of which is enclosed. Ratifications were exchanged at Baghdad on 19th December, 1924. Article 1 of the Treaty provides that His Britannic Majesty shall be represented in Iraq by a High Gommissioner. By Art i. els 4 of tne Treaty the King of Iraq without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 17 and i 18 of the Treaty agrees to be guided by the advice ot ili s Britannic .ulajesty tendered through the High Gommiasioner on all important matters affecting the international and financial ob ligations and interests of His Britannic I^iajesty for the whole period of the treaty. His Majesty the King of Iraq also agrees that he will fully consult the High Commissioner on what is conducive to a sound financial and fiscal policy and that he will assure the stability and good organisa tion of the finances of the ^-raq Government as long as that Government is under financial obligations to the Government of His Britannic Majesty* 3y Article 10 of the Treaty the High Contrac ting Parties agree to conclude separate agreements to secure the execution of any treaties, agreements or undertakings which His Britannic .ajesty is under obligation to see carried out in respect of Iraq. His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes to bring in any legislation necessary to ensure the execution of these agreements. This Article also provides that such agree ments shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations. By(Z. By Article 17 of the Treaty any difference which may arise between the High Contracting Parties ds to the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty is to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. 3. On 26th March 1924 Sir H.Dobbs the High Commissioner for • L raq communicated to the -Prime Minister of Iraq by letter a list of the treaties, agreements and Undertakings which His Majesty^ Government considered were referred to in Article 10 of the Treaty and requested that he might receive an official reply notifying the concurrence of the Government of iraq. A copy of this letter is enclosed. It will be observed in this letter no reference is made to the agreements with the Shaikh of Kuwait or the Shaikh of Mohammerah regarding the exemption from taxation of their date gardens. On 17th April, 1924 Mr. Davisdon the Counsellor to the High Commissioner for Iraq wrote to the Prime Minister for Iraq pointing out that in the letter of 26th March no reference was made to the obligations to the Shaikh of Kuwait and Mohammerah that their date gardens should always be exmept from taxation, on the ground that the matter was a minor obligation in respect of Iraq which the -British Government contracted at the very commencement of the compaign for the libera tion of Iraq in 1914. A copy of this letter is enclosed herewith. iAr. Davidson also pointed out that the High CommissionerI IZ felt sure that the Iraq Government would recognise the obligation as a debt of honour to those who helped in the campaign in its early and most doubtful stages and that in view of the difficulties of settling the matter at taat juncture His Britannic Majesty's Government had decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs concerned among the Agreements covered by Article 10 of the Treaty, unless the Iraq Government desired to do so, and that the matter might be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two governments. On 10th July 1924 the Prime Minister of Iraq replied (copy attached) to the letter dated 26th March 1924 stating that the J-raq Government had accepted the Agreements, Treaties and Obligations referred to in Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty and mentioned in the High Commissioner's letter of 26th March 1924. It will be observed that in this letter no reference is made to 2Jr. Davidson's letter of 17th April 1924 as to the obligation to exempt the date gardens of the two Shaikhs from taxation. 'Phe Iraq Government did, however, continue to accord exemption from taxation of date gardens in question and the matter was not re-opened by the Iraq Government until December, 1926, after the elapse of more than two years. On 10th August 1927 the Secretary to the Council of Ministers informed the Secretary to the High Commissioner that the provisions of the Organic Lav/ were clear asm as to the necessity of collecting the tax and that it was impossible to continue the exemption except by a special law and that it was doubtful whether the law would be passed having regard to the political and economic conditions of the country { a copy of th-i letter is enclosed herewith)• 4. On the 14th December 1927 a new Jsuch Treaty has not been ratified or entered into force# At the time of the negotiation of the /inglo-Iraq Treaty of the 14th December 1927 the Iraqi Delegates asked for and were furnished with a memorandum containing a list of the Britrsh International obligations in respect of Iraq. The promises given to the two Shaikhs of immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens in Iraq were mentioned in the wiemoran- dum and no objection to the terms of that Memorandum was raised by the Iraqi Delegates during the course of the negotiations. His Majesty 1 s Government had therefore reason to conclude that the Iraq Government were prepared to recognise the obligations to the two Shaikhs though they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so or expressly accepted the memorandum as an accurate statement of British Inter national obligations in respect of J-raq. It was not until the middle of last year that it again bec»ae evident that the(3D the Iraq Government were unwilling to honour these obligations. The matter had in the meanwhile been considered by the Financial Mission app ointed by the Secretary of State in Jarch 1925 to enquire into the Financial Positio: and Prospects of the Government of Iraq and such Mission recommended that the Government of Iraq should withdraw any claim that the obligation to the two Shaikhs should be made a charge upon Great Britain. Gmd 2438 see paragraph VIII of Appendix at pages 61 and 62 copy enclosed. It will be observed that the Revenue involved is stated to have ori ginally amounted to Rs. 87,000 per annum and that the amount lias since been increa sed by a change in the rate of taxation to Rs. 1,20,000 per annum. The total amount of taxation remitted by the British Government between 1914 and 1920 was Rs. 6,12,048.8 namely, in respect of the properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait Rs. 4,04998.2 and in respect of the pro perties of the Shaikh of Mohammerah at Rs. 2,07050.6. While the taxes not collected by the Iraq Government between 1921 and 1928 amount to Rs. 8,49030.4 namely. Rs. 5,65086.14 on the Shaikh of Kuwait's garden and Rs. 2,83943.6 on the Snaikh of Mohammerah* s garden. 5. Apart from any definite treaty obligations on the part of the Iraq Government to honour these obligations it appears to Lord Passfield that there areare other considerations which justify tne contention of His Majesty^ Government that the Iraq Government should continue to honour these obligations. In the first place Iraq was captured from the Turks at great cost to the British nation and the Territory so captured has been handed over to the new state of Iraq and the obligations ^iven by His Majesty's Government to the two Shaikhs were only a very small part of the price paid by His Majesty^ Government for victory in Iraq. In the second place in the general financial settlement between His Majesty's Government and Iraq which was effected as from ist April 1921, the Iraq Government took over all the assets of the Civil Adminis tration (with the exception of certain assets derived from military expenditure, vote of credit, or Army funds) and assumed responsi bility for all civil charges in the future in return for the assumption by His Majesty's Government of responsibility for the net deficit of the civil administration on 3lst March 1921. It is accordingly open to con tention that the liability to continue to accord exemption from taxation to the two Shaikhs in accordance with the promise made to them on behalf of His Majesty's Government was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq Government assumed responsibility in this general settlement. Thirdly, although Lord Passfield under stands that it cannot be said that there is any definite accepted rule of international lawva &gt;tS- law which automatically subrogates a succeeding State to the contract!onal rights and obligations of its predecessor modern usage of nations has tended to the acknowledgment of such obligations and his Lordship, understands that it is the gener- ally accepted practice that on the transfer frorji one State to another of responsibility for the Administration of any area the state to which the responsibility is trans ferred should, in the absence of any expre$ provision to the contrary, at the same time take over the assets and liabilities attaching to the area in question# It would appear, therefore, that it could fairly be contended that, when the responsibility for the administration of Iraq passed from His Majesty^ Government to the Iraq Government the latter Gover- ment fact ^ assumed responsibility for continuing the exemption from taxation promised to the two Shaikhs. 6. Having regard to all the circums tances it appears to Lord Passfield that there are good reasons from the point of view of equity, international practice and treaty obligations for contending that the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq Government are bound to implement and that if the Iraq Government are not prepared to honour these obligations the question should be referred to arbitration under article 17 of the Treaty of 1922. 7. There are, however, certain di fficulti esdifficulties in the way of arbitration- Article 17 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 provides that any difference that may arise between the contracting parties as to the interpretation of the provisions of the treaty shall be referred to arbit ration and it would therefore appear that the only question which could be referred to arbitration is the question whether the obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by the provision of the Treaty. Having regard to the fact that the obligations to the Shaikhs were not men tioned in the letter dated 26th March, 1924 from the High Commissioner to the Prime Minister of Iraq there would appear to be some difficulty in maintaining that such obligations are covered by article 10 of the Treaty. Lord Passfield is, however, advised that if there is any possibility of the question of the obliga tions to the two Shaikhs being submitted to arbitration or to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague care should be taken, in the meantime to make no statement or admission which might prejudice the use of any argument founded on Article 10 of the Treaty. Lord Pass- field is also advised that if the matter is referred unilaterally tolthe Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague it could only be so referred under Article 17 of the Treaty and that under that Article His Majesty's Government could only ask for the decision of the Court on thethe matters in dispute in so far as such matters arise out of the interpretation or application of the Treaty. In such circums tances it appears to be desirable that the Government of Iraq should be induced to submit the question to arbitration by- special agreement and that the agreement should be drafted in the widest possible terms in order that the terms of reference „ may include not only the question whether the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exemption from taxation under the terms of the Treaty but also whether they are so obliged under the rules of international law. Should the Iraqi Government refuse to enter into a special agreement to refer the C lb ' (r-* matter in dispute to the Hague^by the ' unilateral application of His Majesty's Government Lord Passfield is advised that the application should be framed in general terms and not with reference to any single or particular Article of the Treaty. 8. A further point arises in that the Sheil&lt;h of Kuwait is an independent sovereign and would presumably have to be recognised by King Faisal as such. In that case there would be no juris diction in Iraq over his property. It appears to be doubtful however whether this is a point which could properly be dealt with in the proposed arbitration, since it would seem rather to be matter for the local Courts if and when a legal claim is made to tax his@) 9. In these circumstances I am to request that you will be good enough to furnish Lord Passfield with your opinion generally and in particular on the following questions:- 1. Do you agree that it would be advis able if possible, to induce the Iraqi j Government to agree to a special reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague and that such reference should be framed in the widest possible terras in order to include not only the question whether the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exemption from taxation under the terms of the Treaty but also under the rules of international law? (2) If it is impossible to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to submit a special reference to the Hague do you agree that it would be open to His Majesty Government to refer the matter to the Hague under the provisions of Article 17 of the Treaty? (3) If the answer to Question (2) is in the affirmative would such reference in your opinion, be confined to the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty and whether the obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by article 4 Or article 10 of the Treaty? to refer the matter to the Hague do you agree that the reference should be framed in general terms and not with reference to any particular article of the Treaty (4) If it possible and becomes necessary a ndand that in the meantime no admission should be made 'by or on behalf of His (Majesty's Government which might be construed as an adandonment by His • Majesty's Government of the right to raise the question under Article 10 of the Treaty? (5) Whether, in your opinion, there is a reasonable prospect of success if the matter is (a) referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague by His majesty's Government pur suant to Article 17 of the Treaty, (b) referred to arbitration in virtue of a special reference framed upon the lines suggested in paragraph 9 (1) above.

Iri November 1914 in order to ensure the assistance of the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with the military operations then proceeding against the Turks in the Persian Gulf a letter dated 3rd November, 1914, was addressed by the Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul General in the Persian Gulf to the Shaikh of Kuwait in which he was promised inter alia, that the date gardens then in his possession situate between Pao and Qurnah should remain in his possession and in possession of his descendants without being subject to payment of revenue or taxes. A copy of the 3ed Nov., 1914. letter is enclosed. Cn 2lst November, 1914, a letter 2lst Nov .j, 1914* (copy enclosed herewith) was addressed by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty's Consul- General for Pars to the Shaikh of Mohammerah in which he was also promised that in consideration for the assistance he had rendered to the British Government the date garden he then possessed on the Turkish side of the Shatt -al-Arab should remain in full possession of himself and his heirs and imnune from taxation. The date gardens referred to in these letters are situated in territory which has now become part of Iraq. 2. On 10th October, 1922, a Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq was signed at Baghbad, The Law Officers of the Crown.a copy of which is enclosed. Ratifications were exchanged at Baghdad on 19th December, 1924. Article 1 of the Treaty provides that His Britannic Majesty shall be represented in Iraq by a High Commissioner. By Article 4 of the Treaty the King of Iraq without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 17 and 18 of the Treaty agrees to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner on all important matters affecting the International and financial obligations and interests of His Britannic Majesty for the whole period of the Treaty. His Majesty the King of Iraq also agrees that he will fully consult the High Commissioner on what is conducive to a sound financial and fiscal policy and that he will assure the stability and good organisation of the finances of the Iraq Government so long as that Government is under financial obligations to the Govern ment of His Britannic Majesty. By Article 10 of the Treaty the High Contracting Parties agree to conclude separate agreements to secure the execution of any treaties, agreements or undertakings which His Britannic Majesty is under obligation to see carried out in respect of Iraq. His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes to bring in any legislation necessary to ensure the execution of these agreements. This Article also provides that such agreements shall be communicated to the Council of the League of Nations. By Article 17 of the Treaty any difference which may arise between the High Contracting Parties as to the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty is to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations . 3. On 26th March, 1924, Sir H.Dobbs the High Commissiorjj er for Iraq communicated to the Prime Minister of Iraq r- I-ti g6th Mar. &gt; l9 2 4&gt; /V / J • r 17th Apr&gt; 1924&gt; 10th July. 1924 by letter a list of the Treaties, Agreements and Undertakings which His Majesty's Government considered were referred to in Article 1C of the Treaty and requested that he might receive an official reply notify ing the concurrence of the Government of Iraq. A copy of this letter is enclosed. It will be observed that in this letter no reference is made to the agreements with the Shaikh of Kuy^ait or the Shaikh of Mohammerah regarding the exemption from taxation of their date gardens. On 17th April, 1924, Mr. Davidson the Counsellor to the High Commissioner for Iraq wrote to the Prime Minister of Iraq pointing out that in the letter of 26th March no reference was made to the obligations to the Shaikh of Kuwait and Mohammerah that their date gardens should always be exempt from taxation, on the ground that the matter was a minor obligation in respect of Iraq which the British Government contracted at the very commencement of the campaign for the liberation of Iraq in 1914. A copy of this letter is enclosed herewith. Mr. Davidson also pointed out that the High Commissioner felt sure that the Iraq Government would recognise the obligation as a debt of honour to those who helped in the campaign in its early and most doubtful stages and that in view of the difficulties of settling the matter at that juncture His Britannic Majesty's Government had decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs concerned among the Agreements covered by Article 10 of the Treaty, unless the Iraq Government desired to do so, and that the matter might be reserved for subsequent settlement between the two governments. On 10th July, 1924, the Prime Minister of Iraq replied(copy attached) to the letter dated ?6th March, 1924, stating that the Iraq Government had accepted the Agreements, Treaties and Obligations referred to in Article 10 of the Angle- Iraq Treaty and mentioned in the High Commissioner's letter&gt; letter of 26th March, 1924. It will 'be observed that in this letter no reference is made to Mr# Davidson's letter of 17th April, 1-924, as to the obligation to exempt the date gardens of the two Shaikhs from taxation. The Iraq Government did, however, continue to accord exemption from taxation of the date gardens in question and the matter was not re-opened by the Iraq Government until December, 1926, after the elapse of more than two years. On 10th August, 1927, the Secretary to the Council of Ministers informed the Secretary to the High Commis sioner that the provisions of the Organic Law were clear as to the necessity of collecting the tax and that it was impossible to continue the exemption except by a special law and that it was doubtful whether the law would be passed having regard to the political and economic 10th Aug *, 1927 . conditions of the country( a copy of the letter Is enclosed herewith). 4. On the 14th December, 1927, a new Anglo-Iraq Treaty was entered Into but such Treaty has not been ratified and has not entered Into force. At the time of the negotiation of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of the 14th December, 1927, the Iraqi Delegates asked, for and were furnished with a memorandum containing a list of the British International obligations In respect of Iraq. The promises given to the two Shaikhs of Immunity from taxation In respect of their date gardens In Ireq were mentioned In the Memorandum and no objection to the terms of that Memorandum was raised by the Iraqi Delegates during the course of the negotiations. His Majesty's Government had therefore reason to conclude that the Irsq Government were prepared to recognise the obligations to the tv^o Shaikhs though they had'not expressly stated that they were willing to do so or expressly accepted the memorandum as im as an accurate statement of British International obligations in respect of Iraq* It was not until the middle of last year that it again became evident that the Iraq Government were unwilling to honour these obligations. The matter had in the meanwhile been considered by the Financial Mission appointed by the Secretary of State in March, 1925, to enquire into the Financial Position and Prospects of the Government of Iraq and such Mission # recommended that the Government of Iraq should withdraw any claim that the obligation to the two Shaikhs should be made a charge upon Great Britain. (See Cmd. 2438, paragraph VIII of Appendix at pages 61 and 62, copy enclosed). It will be observed that the Revenue involved is stated to have originally amounted to Rs. 87,000 per annum and that the amount has since be&amp;n increased by a change in the rate of taxation to Rs. 1,20,000 per annum. The total amount of taxation remitted by the British Government between 1914 and 1920 was Rs. 6,12,048.8 namely in respect of the properties of the Shaikh of Kuwait Rs. 4,04,998.2 and in respect of the properties of the Shaikh of Mohammerah at Rs. 2,07,050.6. While the taxes not collected by the Iraq Government between 1921 and 1928 amount to Rs. 8,49,030.4 namely Rs. 5,65,086.14 on the Shaikh of Muwait^s garden and Rs. 2,83,943.6 on the Shaikh of Mohammerah , s garden. 5. Apart from any definite treaty obligations oh the part of the Iraq Government to honour these obligations it appears to Lord Passfield that there are other considers tions which justify the contention of His Majesty^ Government that the Iraq Government should continue to honour these obligations. In the first place Iraq wes captured from the Turks at great cost to the British nation and the territory so captured has been handed over to the new state of Iraq and the obligations given by Kis Majesty's Govern ment to the two Shaikhs were only a very small part of the price paid by His Majesty's Government for victory in Iraq. In the second place in the General financialsettlement between His Majesty 's Government and Iraq which was effected as from 1st April, 1921, the Iraq Government took over all the assets of the Civil Administra- tion(with the exception of certain assets derived from military expenditure, vote of credit, or Army funds) and assumed responsibility for all civil charges in the future in return for the assumption by His Majesty's Government of responsibility for the net deficit of the civil adminis tration on 31st March, 1921, It is accordingly open to contention that the liability to continue to accord exemption froA taxation to the two Shaikhs in accordance with the promise made to them on behalf of His Majesty's Government was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq Government assumed responsibility in this general settlement Thirdly, although Lord Passfield understands that it cannot be said that there is any definite accepted rule of international law which automatically subrogates a succeeding State to the contractional rights and obligations of its predecessor, modern usage of nations has tened to the acknowledgment of such obligations and His Lordship understands that it is the generally accepted practice that on the transfer from one State to another of responsibility for the administration of any area the State to which the responsibility is transferred should, in the absence of any express provision to the contrary, at the same time take over the contractual assets and liabilities attaching to the area in question# It would appear, therefore, that it would fairly be contended that, when the responsibility for the administra tion of Iraq passed from His Majesty^ Govera^nent to the Iraq Government the latter Government ipso facto assumed responsibility for continuing the exemption from taxation promised to the two Shaikhs.6. Having regard to all the circumstances it appears to Lord Tassfield that there are good reasons from the point of view of equity, international practice and treaty obligations for contending that the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq Govern ment are bound to implement and that if the Iraq Government are not prepared to honour these obligations the question should be referred to arbitration under Article 17 of the Treaty of 1922, 7. There are, however, certain difficulties in the way of arbitration. Article 15 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 provides that any difference that may arise between the contracting parties as to the interpretation of the provisions of the treaty shall be referred to arbitration and it would there-fore appear that the only question which could be referred to arbitration is the question whether the obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by the provisions of the Treaty. Having regard to the fact that the obligations to the Shaikhs were not mentioned in the letter dated 26th March, 1924, from the High Commissioner to the Frime Minister of Iraq there 7/ould appear to be some difficulty in maintaining that such obligations are covered by Article 10 of the Treaty. Cn the other hand, it seems probable that reliance could be placed on Article 4 of the Treaty. The undertakings to the Shaikhs could. Lord Tassfield considers reasonably be described as an important matter affecting the international and financial obligations of His Britannic Majesty, and thus a matter upon which the Iraqi Government are under an obligation to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner. It should be mentioned here that loigjtLord r &amp;ssfield Is advised that If there is any possibility of the question of the obligations to the two Shaikhs being: submitted to arbitration or to the Permanent Court of Internationa.! Justice at the Hague care should be taken, in the meantime to make no statement or admission which rai{rht prejudice the use of any a/gument before that Court including an argument founded on Article 10 of the Treaty, Lord Passfifeld is also acivised that if the matter is referred un ilaterally to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the K? ?ue it could only be so referred under Article 17 of the Treaty and that under that Article His Majesty's Government could only ask for the decision of the Court on the matters in dispute In so far as such matters arise out of the Interpretation or appli cation of the Treaty. In such circumstances It appears to be desirable that the Government of Iraq should be Induced to submit the question to arbitration by special agreement and that the agreement should be drsfted In the widest possible terms In order that the terms of reference may Include not only the question whether the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exemption from taxation under the terms of the Treaty but also whether they are so obliged under the rules of International law. Should the Iraqi Government refuse to enter Into a special agreement to refer the matter In dispute to the Hague and the matter has to be referred to the Hague by the unilateral application of His Majesty's Government Lord Passfleld Is advised that thfe applica tion should be framed in general terms with reference to the whole Treaty and not with reference to any particular Article or Articles of the Treaty. 8.A further point arises in that the Shaikh of Kuwait Is an Independent sovereign and would presumably bebe recognised by King Faisal as such. In that case neither the Courts nor the authorities of Iraq would have any legal right to make any order for taxation against him, nor to enforce any such order, i f mad e. % 9. In these circumstance I am to request that you will be good enough to furnish Lord Passfield with your opinion generally and in particular on the following ques t ions t- (1) Do you agree that it would be advisable if possible to induce the Iraqi Government to agree to a special reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague and that such reference should be framed in the widest possible terms in order to include not only the question whether the Iraqi Government are obliged to continue the exemption from taxation under the terms of the Treaty but also by reason of the financial settlement of 1921 and under the rules of international law 0 (2) In view of the fact that a definite pronounce ment in confirmation of the view expressed in paragraph 8 above might strengthen the position of His Majesty's Government vis-a-vis the Iraq Government, do you consider that the reference to the Hague Court should be so framed as to cover the question whether, in view of the status of the Shaikh of Kuwait as an independent sovereign, it would be in accordance with international law and usage that his properties in Iraq should be immune from taxation? (3) If it is impossible to induce the Iraqi Govern ment to agree to submit a special reference to the Hague do you agree that it would be open to His Majesty t s GovernmentGovernment to refer the matter to the Hague under the provisions of Article 17 of the Treaty? (4) If the answer to question (3) is in the affirmative would such reference, in your opinion, by reason of the provisions of Article 17 be confined to the interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty and to the question v/hether the obligations to the two Shaikhs are covered by Article 4 or Article 10 of the Treaty? (5) If it is possible and becomes necessary to refer the matter to the ^ague do you agree that the reference should be framed in general terms with reference to the whole Treaty and not with reference to any particular Article or Articles of the Tre&amp;ty and that in the meantime no admission should be made by or on behalf of His Majesty's Government which might be construed as an abandonment by His Majesty's Government of the right to rely on Article 10 of the Treaty# (6) Whether, in your opinion, there is a reasonable prospect of success if the matter is (a) referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague by His Majesty's Government pursuant to Article 17 of the Treaty,(b) referred to arbitration in virtue of a special reference framed upon the lines suggested in paragraph 9 (l) above# I am.

After discussion with Sir F. Humphrys His r^ajesty s Government are satisfiea that it would be in the interests of all parties that amicable settlement should it possible be reached by direct negotiation between Iraq Government and Shaikh^. In these circumstances they propose to authorise Iraq Prime Minister to enter into cuect negotiations with a view to settlement on basis of purchase of date gardens and right of exemption thereto attacning. Humphrys considers that results are only probable if Iraq Government can be assured at any rate in the first instance that His Majesty's Government ( ? omission 'will take') no active part in discussions and will leave Prime Minister % and the Sheikhs to work out settlement between themselves. It is proposed therefore to inform Iraq Prime Minister that His iZajesty's Government would have no objection to his opening direct negotiations with the Sheikh's councillors and that they leave it to trie interested parties to try to reach solution in agreement; that snoulc. deadlock be reached they contemplate offer of tt^ir good offices to secure settlement fair to all parties, but that il no direct settlement is arrived-before treaty has to be submitted to Iraq Parliament in November they would-uv have to press for inclusion of these undertakings amongst international obligations referred to in Article vill.

I fear that Shaikh who is already somewhat incline! to 'be suspicious of British policy with' r egard / proposal as attempt on part of His Majesty^s Gorernment to erade fulfilment of the definite promise made to him on behalf of the British Government liy Political Resident on 3rd November 1914. LJore especially will this 'be the case if the Political Agent is not allowed to inform him a'bout line which His Majesty's Gov^rnaient will adopt in event of 'breakdown of negotiations or give him an assurance that in last resort they will give their good offices to secure settlement fair to all parties. Unless such an assurance is ^iven announce ment to Shaikh would inevitaTsly give impression that His Majesty's Governaient were no longer interesting themselves in the matter and were leaving Shaikh to get the 'best terms he could from his powerful neighbour I would therefore urge that Political Agent should 'be authorised when indicating to Shaikh advantages of direct settlement to inform him at the same time that in event of deadlock His Majesty's Govern ment contemplate offer of their good offices. further I would suggest that Iraq Govern ment, should ^e advised to offer liberal and even generous f c Xcsisxs t / 7 t / ^ can agenerous terms» Shaikh is not in a position to bargain and rwint accept vrhat he is offered. A generous offer % taking full account not only of right of exemption attaching to properties /but also including compensation for compulsory dispossession might reconcile Shaikh to loss of prestige attaching to position of large land owner. This factor should 'be taken into consideration if agreed settlement is to 'be looked for and intervention of His Majesty's Government avoided. Finally I woul,d emphasise that Kuwait revenues have 'been reduced to alsout one quarter of what they were formerly &gt;y blockade. Last year there was a deficit which was made good 'by contribution from privy purse. If Shaikh's private income is also reduced financial position of Principality will ©ecome critical.

July, 1930. doting H.Cro Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram Ho.436 of the 4th Deoem'ber and to subsequent telegraphic correspondence on the question of the exemption from taxation of the date gardens of the Shailihs of Kuwait and Mohammerah, on which, after talcing legal advice, I am now in a position to address you further. 2. I am advised that it is open to doubt whether the contention put forward in your telegram under reference, that the obligations of His Majesty^ G-overnment to the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait are covered by Article 10 of the Anglo- Iraq, Treaty of the 10th October, 1922, could be maintained. It is not suggested that the * obligations of His Majesty's Government to the two Shaikhs would not be covered by the general terms of that Article, if the Article stood alone. But I am advised that Article 10 must be construed together with Sir H.Dobbs 1 letter to the Iraq. Prime Minister of the 26th March, 1924 and the Iraq. Prime Minister's reply of the 10th of July, 1924. Sir Henry Dobbs* letter, which was written for the express purpose of defining the Treaties and Agreements referred to in Article 10, contained no mention of the obligations to the two Shaikhs. The Iraq Government were subsequently informed, in Mr.Davidson 1 s letter No. P.0.75 of the 17th of April/r-inw - t * JumMSSStrnrn 17 ^ April, 1924, that the undertakings to the two Shaikhs were r, a minor obligation' to which it was not thought necessary to allude in the notes exchanged under Article 10, and that 'in view or the difficulties of settling a matter of this kind at the present Juncture His Majesty 1 s Government have decided not to include these obligations to the Shaikhs concerned among the Agreements covered by Article 10 of the Treaty unless the Iraq Government desires to do so'. In his reply to Sir Henry Dobbs 1 letter, the Iraq Prime Minister, while accepting, as covered by Article 10, the Treaties and Agreements set out in that letter, made no reference to Mr•Davidson 1 s letter of the J. 7 th of Aprilor to the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs. In the circumstances. His Majesty's Government might find it difficult to establish that these undertakings were covered by Article 10. This does not, however, imply- that the Iraq Government are not bound to give effect to the undertakings. They were informed of their existence in Mr.Davidson's letter of the 17th of April, 19 34. In the Iraq Prime Minister's reply to Sir Henry Dobbs' letter of the 26th of March, 1924 no exception was taken to them, and as the Iraq Government continued to accord exemption from taxation to the Shaikhs, it was reasonable to assume at that time that the Iraq Government recognised their liability to continue to accord such exemption. It was not until th^ end of 1926, some two years after the ratification of the 1922 Treaty, that the question was again raised by the Iraq/ 111 17 Iraq. Grovernment, who then contended that the exemption hitherto accorded were illegal and could not be continued. 3, At the time of the negotiation of the unratified Anglo-Iraq Treaty of the 14th December, 1927 the Iraqi delegates asked for, and were furnished with, a memorandum containing a list of British international obligations in respect of Iraq, The promises of immunity from taxation given to the two Shaikhs were mentioned in that memorandum, and no objection to its terms was raised by the Iraqi delegates during the course of the negotiations. Kis Majesty's Government had therefore some ground for assuming that the Iraq Government were prepared to recognise the obligations to the two Shaikhs, although they had not expressly stated that they were willing to do so, or expressly accepted the memorandum as an accurate statement of British international obligations in respect of Iraq. Indeed it was not until the middle of last year that it again became evident that the Iraq Government were unwilling to honour the obligations to the two Shaikhs. 4. While, therefore. His Majesty's Government are by no means debarred from claiming that their obligations to the two Shaikhs have devolved upon the Iraq Government under Article 10 of the Treaty, it is open to doubt whether such a claim would succeed before a court of arbitration. Nevertheless, I am advised that His Majesty's Government should on no account abandon the right to invoke Article 10 should the matter be taken to arbitration, and for that reason it is important that any communication/■ ^ II v oommunication that may now be addressed to the Iraq. G-overnment should contain no statement which might be construed as an abandonment by His Majesty^ Government of the right to rely upon Article 10 or, indeed, which might preclude the use of any argument based upon other articles of the Treaty which His Majesty^ Government might later wish to adduce before a Court of Arbitration. 5. I am advised that, apart from Artie; 10, the undertaking to the two Shaikhs could properly be described as an important matter 'affecting the international and financial obligations of His Britannic Majesty' 1 within the meaning of Article 4 of thejL92E Treaty and thus a matter upon which the Iraqi Government are at present under obligation to be guided by the advice of His Britannic Majesty tendered through the High Commissioner. His Majesty f s Government could properly contend, therefore, that, in virtue of that Article, the Iraq. Government are bound to honour those undertakings if His Britannic Majesty so advises. 6. Apart, however, from any specific Treaty obligations on the part of the Iraqt Government, there are other considerations which in themselves justify the contention of His Majesty 1 s Government that the Iraq. Government should honour these obligations^ These might appropriately be brought to the notice of the Iraq. Government. In the first place, Iraq, was captured from the Turks at great cost to the British nation, the territory so captured has been handed over to the new State of Iraq, and the undertakings given by HisMajesty T s Government to the two Shaikhs were only a'yery small part/'73 {ijs) part of the price paid by His Majesty's Government for victory in Iraq.# This consideration was emphasized and endorsed by the Financial Mission to Iraq, in paragraph 8 of the Appendix to their Report of the 25th April, 1925. 7. In the second place, under the general financial settlement between His Majesty's Grovernnent and Iraq, which was effected as from the 1st April, 1921, the Iraq Government took over all the assets of the Civil Administration (with the exception of certain assets derived frcm military expenditure, vote of credit, or Army Funds), and assumed responsibility for all Civil charges in the future, in return for the assumption lay His Majesty's Government of responsibility for the net deficit of the Civil Administration on the 31st March, 1921, It is a reasonable contention that the liability to continue to accord exemption from taxation to the two Shaikhs, in accordance with the promise made to them on behalf of His Majesty's Government, was one of the liabilities for which the Iraq Governnent assumed responsibility in this general settlement# 8. Thirdly, although there is no definite accepted rule of international practice, which automatically subrogates a succeeding State to the contractui^al rights and obligations of its predecessor, I am advised that modern usage of nations has tended to the acknowled^nent of such obligations and it is the generally accepted practice that, on the transfer from one State to another of responsibility for the ackainistration of any territory, the State to which the responsibility is transferred should, in the absence of any express/rvoitar 8 express provision to the contrary, at the same time take over the contraotural assets and liabilities attaching to the territory in question. It would appear, therefore, that it could fairly tie contended that, when the responsibility for the administration of Iraq, passed from His Majesty 1 s Government to the Iraq. Government, the latter Government Ipso facto assumed responsibility for continuing the exemption from taxation promised to the two Shaikhs. 9. Having regard to all these considerations it is clear that there are good reasons, from the point of view of eq.uity, international practice and treatly obligation, for contending that the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs are obligations which the Iraq. Governnent are bound to implement. His Majesty^ Goverment have, therefore, decided that, if the Iraq Government are not prepared to honour those obligations, the question at issue should be referred to arbitration. 10. A reference to arbitration under Article 17 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 would, hew ever, be open to the objection that it would necessarily be confined to an interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty and to the question whether the obligations to the two Shaikhs were covered by those provisions. Such a restriction might diminish the chances of success. Therefore, since any unilateral application for arbitration by His Majesty's Government could only be made under Act 17, every effort/effort should be made, if the Iraq. Government still refuse to honour the undertakings to the two Shaikhs, to induce them to concur in a special reference being made 'by agreement to the Permanent Court of International Justice. This reference should 'be framed in the widest possible terms so as to cover not only the question of the obligations of the Iraq. Government under the provisions of the Treaty of 1932, but also the obligations of the Iraq. Government by reason of the financial settlement of 1921 and under the rules of international law. It should include also the question whether it is in accordance with International law that the properties of the shaikh of Kuwait should be immune from taxation as a conseq.uence of his status as an independent sovereign. (In this connection reference is invited to paragraph 3 of my Secret despatch of the 4th of November 1929). In order to induce the Iraq, (xovernment to consent to the submission of the question to arbitration by special agreement it mi^it be pointed out to them that it would be much mare in accordance with their dignity voluntarily to submit the whole question in dispute to the Court in accordance with the procedure which, under the Optional Clause all the great Powers have now undertaken or are about to undertake to follow in their relations with each other, than to be forced to appear before the Court by unilateral application under Article 17 of the Treaty. 11. It seems possible that, if the Iraq, Governnent/mam « 17 L w Government realise that His Majesty^ Governinent are determined, if necessary, to submit the question unilaterally to arbitration, they will agree to honour the undertakings to the two Shaikhs. Whatever the decision of the arbitrator, the Iraq Government could hardly fail to be shown up in an unfavourable light during the course of the arbitral proceedings. They would probably be unwilling that the first case to be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice in which they were interested should be a case which, whatever the decision, would be bound to reflect discredit upon them. If, however, in spite of these considerations, the Iraq. Government refuse either to honour their undertakings or to consent to a special reference to arbitration upon agreed terms. His Majesty^ Government will have no alternative but to refer the matter to the Court of International Justice under Article 17 of the Treaty of 1922, As I have pointed out above such a reference wouldjnecessarily be confined to an interpretation of the provisions of the Treaty. I am advised, however, that within those limits it should be framed as widely as possible, that is to say with reference to the whole Treaty and not with reference to any particular article or articles, I am advised also that if the matter is referred to arbitration, whether by special agreement or by unilateral application on the part of/V- '7? m of His Majesty*s Government, there is a reasonable chance of success® 12.Unless you see strong objection, you should again approach the Iraq Government with the request that they should honour the undertakings given to the two Shaikhs. In so doing you should make such use as you think fit of the arguments outlined above, care being taken, however, to say nothing to the Iraq Government which might prejudice the use of any argument that His Majesty's Government might subsequently see fit to adduce before a Court of Arbitration, Subject to that reservation, I must leave to your discretion the exact manner in which you should invoke the provisions of the 1922 Treaty in support of your arguments, but I am disposed to think that you would find it best to confine any arguments under this head to the general assertion that the obligations to the Shaikhs are undertakings which the Iraq Government are bound to implement under the provisions of the 1922 Treaty, You should, at the same time, suggest to the Iraq Government that they should endeavour to effect a final settlement with the Shaikh of Mohammerah by offering him a lump sum in commutation of his claims to exemption from taxation; while in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait you are in a position to make use of the argument that, in virtue of the Shaikh 1 s position as an independent foreign sovereign, the Iraq Government have no/no alternative but to aooord to him immunity from taxation in respect of his property in Iraq., unless, of course, the Shaikh chooses voluntarily to waive that privilege in return for any compensatory benefits that the Iraq. Government may be in a position to offer him. If the Iraq. Government are unwilling to accord those exemptions without parliamentary sanction and feel doubtful of their ability to obtain such sanction, their attention might be drawn to the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of the letter of the 32nd of February, 1927, from Raouf Beg Chadirchi, who, at that time was acting as Iraqi Minister of Justice. (A copy of that letter was enclosed with Mr.Bourdillon*s despatch secret D of the 19th of August, 1927). 13. You are authorised to infom the Iraq. Government at whatever stage you may consider appropriate that, if they persist in their refusal to honour the undertakings to the two Shaikhs, His Majesty^ Government will have no alternative but to claim that the matter should be referred to arbitration, and if this threat fails to influence them, you should endeavour to induce the Iraqt Governnent to consent to a special reference to arbitration by agreement. If the Iraq Government are prepared to agree to such a special reference you should communicate with me further with a view to deciding the terms of reference. 14. I take this opportunity to comment on the suggestion in your telegram of the 4th of December that, having regard to International usage/bhwi usage, the undertaking given to the Shaikh of Kuwait was valueless at the tine it was given, Prior to that assurance, however, the Shaikh of Kuwait had not 'been regarded as an independent ruler but had owed allegiance to the Suitajn of Turkey. It is true that after recognising his independence His Majesty's Govemnent have been bound to accord to him exemption from taxation in accordance with International usage, but this would not have been evident to the Shaikh by the mere declaration that His Majesty's Government recognised his independence, and it appears possible that the addition of the assurance of exemption from taxation was considered necessary in order to make clear to the Shaikh the full implication of that declaration.

The Government of Iraq are determined to refuse to continue in perpetuity the immunity from taxation of the date gardens in Iraq, owned by the Shaikhs of Moharnmerah and Kuwait. 2. This immunity has hitherto been enjoyed by r i the Shaikhs under the undertaking to that effect given to them by H.M.G. in 1914 in exchange for their assistance against the Turks. . The Govt, of India have asked for the P.R 'c. observations on the points raised in the India Office letter of 20-10-27. 4. The letter asks for suggestions as to the course to be adopted in the event of the Iraq Govt, maintaining their refusal, and points out that in 1920 the Govt, of India held that the assurance given in 1914 to the Shaiich of Kuwait was unconditional.

Finally - and this is presumably the main point on which P.R's. observations are required - the letter stresses the iiriijortance of Kuwait because of its position at the head of the Gulf and on the projected Arab Air Route, and points- out the undesirability of taking an attitude which might impair the present good relations existing between its ruler and H.M.G. б.
