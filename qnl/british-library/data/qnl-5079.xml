Hay 1920. (4343). KY Lord, 1 have the honour to subrdt the following remar'- on the question of the rant of sub si dies to Arab Ruler with reference to your Lordship's Despatch Ho,.53~ o May 4th, (&amp;5915/2854/44 ), transmitting the minutes of a meet ing held at the foreign Office on April 17th, in which I observe that the Treasury are not yet convinced o; r the necessity for the continuance o + t&gt;ie suosioies. It appears to me that to arrive at a just decision on this subject, it is necessary in the first place to • co Tpare tVie 'position of the dif erent before tm war, to weigh the services of each daring that period, to examine whether any responsiblity rents on i Majesty's Gevemment for the changes which have occurred, and, finally, te consider whether, on grounds of morality or expediency, it is justifiable to impese on the Britj taxpayer the burden of providing seme er all o them wi monetary assistance in the future. The beginning of the war sar an effective, i not entirely efficient, Ottoman administration in the Hejax an Yemen; Ibn Has Id a, mediatised Turkish Vassal; the ^rl in revolt ag ainst the ruling power but already discussing terms of pe xee; and Ibn Baud, who had not long bet ore ejected the Turks from Hasa and (^ati , showing a dispoiiitl to resume his allegiance, provided that he wis Lowe free hand as Vali of Nejd, and given an adequate stipend it vill be seen that the feeling of racial consciousness Will eh is now so mar Ice , wis already snowing itsel even in the more remote parts of the Penins/sLa, but a study ef the records of the time will also show that the Ottoman # The Right Honourable Sari CuBzen ef Kedlesten, K,G,, G, v » et^j?GovertHs^nt, however uvxwilsingly, wae beginning to realiee ts incapacTty-^ retain 'by force the Arab Countries and was preparing to grant a measure of self-goTemment wni^h might satis*&gt; ihe aspirations of ite inhabitants. The consideration of the subject was, however, abruptly broken off bjr the coxBDiencement of the war, and after the Ottoman GoTernment had deolared against the Allied Powers, Great Britain, taking advantage of the discontent w ich already existed, made promise to the •herif of M#cca, Ibm Saud and the Idrisi which induced them definitely to oa®t eff their allegiance and throw in their lot with the Allies. I do not propese to examine and compare in detail the eervices performed by these three rulers, but I think it may fairly be said that each, according to his capacity, rendered real and effective assistance at a time when the result of the war still hung in the balance and, by so doing, brought to nought the ^lans fer a Jehad, diverted or rendered innocuous large Turkish forces and greatly facilitated mm our task in keeping open te traffic the Red 8ea» It may be said with seme shew of justice that they have had their reward in gaining their independence and fr€€ing themselves from the A urkish yoke, but the fact ast not be lest sight of that, with the remov 1 of the dominant influence, the Arabian Peninsula was left without administrative and financial means or experienoe . for the preservation of order and for the substitution of effective local Government in place of what had existed previously. This applies in particular te the and I cannot refrain from thinking that the pr^ by His Majesty's Government impose a certain mi» obligation to ensure that the future of the-e connti is at least as prosperous as their past. I do not however wish to press unduly th5 since sentimental considerations must give way cb(£) : of •conomy at the present time and 1 will -a«8 on to th more practical aspects of the case. As Your ^ords'il ■) is aware, the Arab rewolt w s ne re^ar ed with sympathy either in in-ila or in our oth€ iehaoraedan Countries^ This feeling still existn tod y^ The revolt can only be justified by its euccess and we shall undoubtedly lay ourselves open to severe critic!nm if the Peninsula passes into a state of anarchy. Further than this, the Allied policy with regarf to Syria and Palestine is not in accord with the wishes rl 1 1 the local populations and has already exposed Hie a . esty Gevemment te a char ge of breach of promise and opened the field to Turkish and Bolshevist propaganda from the Nerth, The situation in the Middle 6 ist to da ^ives ri^e to grave misgivings ^nd neems unlikely to improve in the near future. On this account, I consider it is of great importanc that, if we rain a special rjosltlon in the Arabian Peninsula, His iajesty's Govern iont shou^ so e iploy it as to earn the ^ratttude of the people and silence the criticism of thaoe detractors who accuse us of syniclam and self-interest in our treatment of the Arabs. At the pre rent moment we are in a favourable position to achieve t is since the factors wlilch have rendered so restless the Arabs in Syria and Mesopotamia have not operated with any great foree in the Peninsula 1 tr,elf, ind its Rulers, with the exception of the Iman Yahya and the new Amir of Hail, who has in point of fact aome under the influence of Ibn Saud, have given satisfactory proofs that they are prepared to look to us for help and guidance and protection. The questions then arlae whether we can gain our object without-jL^yment, , if not, whet er t ie results ae«to4«9 achieved will just© irer experience of the last four years shov^ the annwer be •mphatically in the negative, I do not adrocate j undue interference in the internal and local affatr: the Peninsula, but I presuas that we shallotternp&lt; ad, ust the relations between the different ruleye claim to influence all foreign relations, and it it rsasonable to suppose that the rulerf3 will require quid pro quo, Furtherraore, jnoral influence has its ei feet in the iiiasu, but it will not always prove sue a strong deterrent as the threat te cut sff supplies more esnecially in countries which are far removed f civilisation an where it is imneSBible to achieve a purpose by armed force. I de net think it is too much to say that if w. » tempt to gain a predeminant influence in Arabia without being prepared te pay fer it, our efforts will result In failure. As regards the advantages to be gained, I place first and foremost the chance of recovering and mainW ing our prestige in the Middle East. We have destroyed the Power which, however badly, ruled Arabia. We laast put something in its place, and, in so doing, endeavour to re-establish our ^ood name for disinterestednsns anl sympathy with Msslein races, v/e are an shall continue to be hampered in Syria and Palestine It is Iherelore the more necessar to seize our epr^rr- tunity in the Peninsula where the conditions are favour able an whsre we shall not be exposed te foreign rivalry once our special position is recognised. Secondly, there is considerable evidence to shon tHat a determined effort is being made to unite fsla against all European Powers. A friendly Arabia will | an iiaportant check to this. Thirdly, it is necessary te have a friendly population in the countries bordering eur vital s4-6- Equal to these in Importance, la the neceesity of keepinc: open the pilgrimage routes to the Holy Places and of ensuring that the pilgrimage itself is undertaken under better conditions th^an formerly. We are under judgment of the Meslems in all parts ef the world in this matter, and failure will do us incalcul- able ham* Fifthly, I would place the advantages to British trade which the epening up ef the interior ef the Peninsula will afford, and, sixthly, the desirability ef preventing ether cowers from gaining a predominant pesltlon, more especially in South Went Arabia. I trust that the abo e considerations will be suffleler/ to show that the adynntages to be won are not small and that, in the event of His Majesty's Geremnent being grant ed a speelal position there, the necessity of afferding monetary assistcjnce, until such time as the dliferenx. countries can make their own way, will be recognised, I understand that It may be difficult for His ^ajssty' Gevernintent to previde all the money and that Joint subsid ies or leans may be necessary. This would be unfortunate from a British point ef view but it would net alter the principle which I am end( arouring to lay dewn. It would merely mean that the responsibility and therefore the credit to be gained would be collectlTe. I am unpbare of thr reasons which eall for a Joint lean and should hare thought that the Subsidies granted to the Rulers of Bahrelr Musqat, and Keweit by the Gevemment of India before the war, would have furnished a useful precedent in claiming the sole right to give menetary assistance now. I do not advocate the permanent contli uance of subsidies on the present scale, and i weuld gradually replace them with stipends and loans* All the Rulers, with perhaps the exception of Ibn Rashled, possess eea ports or tracts of land or ether resources w Ich are capable of development, and i considerwmm mmmmm -6- 0 that loans should be granted w ier« ere seea ^oed pronpective of a productive return and where assurity can be effered. Stipends should, I think, be g anted to King Husain, Ibn Saud cmd the Idrisi. The case of Ibn Rashid is ef relative unimportance, while that of t- c J *. Yahya is still so obscure that it is idle to censider|it now # Eventually, we shrai probably find-it e' eape lo pay than to fights I also consider that certain conditions should be attached, such as the maintenance of internal peace, acceptance of our control^fforei^n relatio- , and the keeping epen ef the trade and pilgrimage routes.

Even were the Empire's need for rifirorous economy not so obvious as it is, the thoughtful citizen would still consider the time ripe for the removal of the burden which our Hejaz subsidies put upon the British tax-payer, and particu larly so if he happens to have first band knowledge of the way in which, both during and since hostilities, our gifts of gold have been grossly misspent and squandered by the recipients. For two and a half years an undisciplined mob of avaricious and dishonest mercenaries, under the style of Officers of the Arab Army, have been scandalous ly overpaid and have exercised in the fullest measure their ample talents in fleecing their chiefs, the Emirs Abdullah and Ali, by inflating pay lists, selling Government stores and indulging in every other form of direct and indirect robbery. Nine months ago Emir Abdullah's regular army of about 250 men was costing, in pay alone, £1,000 per month. In addition to this peculation, gold sovereigns have been melted up by thousands and converted into fancy swords, daggers, etc., for distribution broad cast as presents to paltry Sheikhs and slaves, and as sops to potential enemies. Much money has been spent by the King and his sons on propaganda in the Iraq, Yemen and Syria. From the earliest days of tho revolt the Bedouin have been unreasonably overpaid, a simple Bedouin receiving £3 per month for his personal services and £3 extra for his camel. There is a story going round, too, of a gold tea service which is said to have been made at Mecca at a cost of £10,000 for use in the 'Roval House. To those British officers who witnessed something of the misuse of British subsidies and who are still unconvinced that the results are commensurate with the outlay, the recent progressive reduction of the King's monthly subsidy of £100,000, by monthly decrements of £25,000 in October, November and December, brought so great a feeling of relief that they may have overlooked the fact that the future of the Hcjaz is a question closely affecting British interests and one calling urgently for consideration. In establishing the new Hejaz State His Majesty's Government incurred a moral responsibility for its future and even had they not given King Husein a wTitten promise to assist him in every way and to provide advisers (which he agreed to accept) it would still be in their own interests to take steps to secure and maintain a sound government in his Kingdom. The importance of the pilgrimage to the Empire has been dealt with too often already to need further emphasis here. Further, the Hejaz has not been properly explored and there may yet be more gold in Midian than the intrusive deposits now lying beneath the tents of the Bedouin. Oil is rumoured to exist on the Red Sea coast and other places, whilst there are many native stories of the existence of metals of all kinds in the neighbourhood of Taif. Eighty per cent, of the Hejaz imports are received from India whilst a recent report from Mecca contains the surprising statement that half the popu lation of Mecca is Indian. These are important facts. From every pomt of view therefore it appears desirable that King Husein should receive future financial aid from us, but we know well that he cannot be trusted to use funds properly or to lead his country towards prosperity without guidance. It is said that at present the Queen keeps and ladles out the subsidy. I am of opinion that our future help should be conditional on his accepting our advice, either through the medium of advisers appointed by us or other wise (as may be decided), in the employment and development of his resources and in establishing a proper administration. To give Husein further money grants without insisting on the very necessary condition would, in my opinion, be throwing more money away.2 Since the departure of the Turks in January last £900,000 has been paid to King Husein as subsidy, but except for two new boilers installed in the Condenser at Jeddah at a cost of about £2,000, none of this huge sum has been used for improvements. It is necessary to review briefly the changes which the Arab Revolt brought to the He]az. Husein, previously a minor religious leader with some authority over the desert tribes, though cf little account in the towns, found himself a despotic Ruler and, thanks to our lavish subsidization, without any worries as to ways and means. Since the revolt he and his sons have had to exercise the functions of government for which they had received no previous training and with nothing but their semi-religious hold over the tribesmen and the distribu tion oHargesse to carry them through. They managed to gather around them a clique of very undesirable Arab officers and othera who, in the guise of advi sers and helpers, have simply acted as additional money wasters. It is, however, due to King Husein to remark that he is nothing like so extravagant and careless in money matters as the Emirs. His worst faults are his lack of progressiveness, and his desire to keep all the Government in his own unskilled and erratic hands. The withdrawal of the Turkish officials from the Hejaz left the Hejaz without skilled administrators, advisers or technical assistants. King Husein failed to replace the majority of them from other sources, but, as a rule, has appoiated illiterate and untrustworthy natives of the Hejaz to the various posts. The result is that Civil Administration has made practically no headway and very few improvements of real import have been introduced. Indeed, it is to be feared that the Arab edition of the Turkish system in all its worst ramilications which Husein has set up is a cause of alarm to the greater number of the citizens of his country. The King has been inclined to spend too much on his regular army and his rivalry with Ibn Sand has undoubtedly led him into further heavy ex penses. The time has now arrived, however, for him to be told that he really requires only a very small army. (1) A small mobile force (in which machine gun power should replace rifle srergth), for dealing with recalcitrant tribes, and (2) small garrisons for the defence of Medina, Mecca and the railway. A force on the following lines would probably meet his requirements :— — Mountain jGuns. Infantry or M. I. Machine Guns. Mecca and Tai? • • • 6 300 10 Medina . • • . . 6 300 10 Railway • • • • t • 2* 800 50 Mobile Column . • • • • • 4 300 6 Total 18 1,700 76 • On armoured trucks. Say a total of 2,500 including officers to ordnance and supply services, etc. The monthly pay list of an army of this strength would amount to about £12,000.It** For the defence of the Railway the King should depend more upon the subsidies to the Bedouins than upon armed force. He has the following tribes to placate south of Maan :— H uweitat . Beni Atiyeh Billi and Mohab Juheinah H arb • 70 miles of line, 180 do. 150 do. 70 do. 50 do. tt For this purpose he will have to make small monthly paymenr» to the Sheikhs of the above tribes in the same way as did the Turks, who it is under stood spent about £T.500 per mensem on this service. The King's fears of aggression by Ibn Saud will not be all iyed until the dispute over Khurma has been arbitrated on by us. Indeed, until the bounda ries of the Hejaz have been definitely fixed and our treaties with the various Arab rulers concluded. King Husein will have an ample supply of pretexts at hand for ke^ng up a larger regular army than he can afford. The King should, I think, be reminded of the revised Arab Policy of His Majesty's Government and, at the first opportunity, should be advised that our help, fiuancial and otherwise, is contingent on his confining his activities to the Hejaz and on his abstention from all propaganda in the ^rab territories outside his sphere. He should be made to understand that our funds are not given him for political intrigues and conspiracies outside the Hejaz or for arming for anything but defence. I am further of opinion that, once the subsidy to Feisal has ceased, we should not allow the King to remit sums from his subsidy to either Fei|al or Zeid. A way of stopping this would be to deduct from the following months allotment a sum equal to that he sends during the previous month to either of his sons in Syria, we could explain our action by saying it is obvious that any sum he can spare for purposes outside his sphere must be surplus to his real needs. In addition to the inauguration of a proper system of civil government wilh the necessary personnel, the following are some of the more important items on which King Husein must now lay out considerable sums of money :— (1) Improvements in the Quarantine stations at Jeddah, Yenbo and one on the Kailway. (2) Repairs to Railway and renewal of rolling stocks (3) Water supplies at the large towns. (4) A road from Jeddah to Mecca. The present local sources of income to the Hejaz Government may be set out as follows :— (1) Quarantine dues. (2) Railway receipts. (3) Postal receipts (and probably cable). (4) Customs receipts. (5) Wakfs. (6) Municipal taxes. It is unlikely that items (2), (3) and (6) will produce any available surplus over expenditure for some time to come. At present it is impossible to say how far the religious nature of item (5) will interfere with its use for meeting ordinary civil expenses, but there is no doubt that it should have some indirect influence on the financial help that the King will need. The Hejaz receives large Wakf payments from other Moslem countries, and information is being asked for from Constantinople and Baghdad as to the annual amounts likely to be transmitted from Turkey and the Iraq in future. • SIn Egypt there will be at the end of the present year an accumulation of al:out £53,000 of Wakf monies to the credit of King Husein as none has been sent during the war. The yearly contributiocs are, approximately, £10,000 for Wakfs and about £9,000 for the Egyptian Hostels in Mecca and Medina. The latter item is a special allotment and obviously cannot be regarded in any way as revenue available for general development purposes, even those of a religious nature. The King's largest item of expense in the near future will be the repairs to the Hejaz Hailway and the renewal of rolling stock. During the revolt extensive damage was done to the line, and the small stock of engines, etc., must now be sufficiently worn out as to require complete renewal as well as augmentation. It is doubtful whether the Ilejaz Eailway was a paying concern under the Turks, who, by means of their conscript army, ran it very cheaply, but the Arab Government will certainly find it an expensive luxury : their skilled labour will have to be imported and their working costs will be considerably higher than were those of the Turks. It is therefore very doubtful whether a separate loan purely for railway purposes and secured against Eailway receipts would be feasible. Moreover, Railway receipts would be difficult to check and supervise should the lending Government find it necesbary to intervene at any time. The possibility of Commercial Syndicates taking concessions to repair and work the Eailway, water systems, etc., should not be overlooked. Such a course would probably be preferred by His Majesty's Government, but private firms would have to be satisfied with the receipts from their enterprises and could not be allowed to have any lien on the Customs revenue which must be reserved as security for British Government loans, etc. It is probable that the firms would ask for guarantees from His Majesty's Government before embark ing on business in the Hcjaz : this might be done. It may perhaps be possible to issue part of our loan in kind, in the form of locomotives, rolling stock, machinery and material for Quarantine, Post and other purposes. In order that a reliable estimate may be made of the future financial needs of the Hejaz, it is suggested that an expert should be sent there to report on the existing financial conditions, and on improvements which could be made towards increasing the Government receipts. He would enquire into the present administration of revenue earning departments and ascertain the rates of the dues and taxes actually levied at present and would further report on the actual yearly receipts from these sources so that their values as security against a loan may be appraised. He would further report on the extent to which Wakf contributions may legally be used in the development of the Hejaz. The official selected would be a Moslem, and he would visit Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, and I recommend that he should base his estimates for these places on the cost of civil administration in towns of similar size in the Sudan. The estimates would, however, be lower as the Hejaz will have no European officials to pay. It is important that the expert should clearly understand that he is pro ceeding t^o the Hejaz on behalf of the British Government with the object not merely of finding out what King Husein would like, but of reporting on the minimum financial help that will suffice for the Hejaz. He should receive an honorarium from us. It is thought that our future financial help to King Husein .should be in two forms. The first a moderate monthly stipend payable for a period of one year and possibly not exceeding £2,000 a month, to form his Civil List. The second to be a loan payable to him in monthly or quarterly instalments secured - against the Customs. In an estimate provided by King Husein some time ago he set his Customs receipts at £15,000 per month. If £6,000 of this wereset aside monthly it would produce £72,000 per annum, sufficient to pay 7 per cent, on a loan of £500,000 and to create a sinking fund for repayment in less than 15 years. The King's stipend will have to be fixed with reference to those drawn by other Arab chiefs. Ibn Saud at present receives £5,000 per month, but doubt less this will be reduced. It is considered that King Husein's stipend should, in any case, be greater than that of Ibn Saud. In the present state of uncertainty as to the outcome of the negotiations now proceeding for the settlement of Arabian and Syrian territories, it is difficult to foresee what share King Husein will have in future in Arab rule outside the Hejaz proper, and particularly how far he w ill have to provide or assist .civil Government, railway administration, etc., north of Maan. Our present discussions w T ith him might, however, be based on the assumption that his activities will be confined to the Hejaz Province as. it existed under Turkish regime and that the financial assistance now contempla ted is for the development of that area only, the districts of Khurma and Qunfudah being for the time being excluded. It is very important that the Hejaz boundaries should be fixed at an early date, more especially those between Nejd and Asir as King Husein will certainly continue to heavily bribe the tribes on and across his borders in order to influence thtir allegiance until we are in a position to instruct him that his activities must be confined within the recognized Hejaz boundaries, and that we will not countenance any encroachments or external propaganda by him. Attached is a Budgetary Statement prepared by Colonel Wilson in April last. It was compiled from ceitain figures supplied by the King but several items w ere estimated by Colonel Wilson personally, e.g., items 5, 6 and 11. Although according to the King's figures the expense include those of quarantine, water supply, Tax Departments, Harbour Masters, post offices, etc., no revenues are included from any of these services, the King's list only showing the receipt of £15,000 per month from Customs. Also, with regard to the £3,000 per month shown as expenditure for the Medina-Maan railway, no Railway receipts are shown. The cost of personnel for Medina would appear to be overestimated as it amounts to over three-quarters of that for Mecca, Taif and Jeddah combined. £3,000 per month for hire of camels from Yanbo to Medina also seems an excessive item, as it is presumed most of the material to be transported will be merchandise at the owner's expense. A total of £27,000 per month for Army expenditure also seems more than the King can afford. The King in his statement also included large sums for his Ministry of Wakfs and the Haram employes (£1,000 per month), Imams, and for the relief for sick and needy, all of which it is thought should form a legitimate charge against Wakfs revenues. The statement is very incomplete and not a great deal of use, in spite of the fact that it was telegraphed to the Foreign Office in support of a re commendation that the King's subsidy should be maintained at £120,000 per month.
