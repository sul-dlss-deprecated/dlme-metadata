The fh’uci Are b G 0 vernsi;nt ask that tv.o point* may be icede clear to them before they reply officiaifLy* 3. The first point is that in the second paragraph of the draft it is stated that duty at the rate of one and three- quarter* per cent ad V£lorem shell be levied on goods consigned to ports in Sa’udl Arabia, or exported from ports in Sa l udi Arabia, Thich ere transhi led without being landed* The Ae^udi Arab representative* state that at the Conference of one and seven-eighths per cent ad valorem was fixed and say that, e.though the latter figure vas, of course, less favourable to the £ eAudi Arab Government, the Ba^di Arab Government vished to draw attention to whet might be an error in the draft. 4. T should be glad if you would kindly let me mow whether the intention of the Bahrain Representatives at the Conference was that the rate should be one and three-quarters or one and seven-eighths per cent ad valorem.5 The second point conc'-yns the seventh percgraph of the draft* The Arab Ooverrrmt en r uire whether the rovision for reconsidering the arrangements implies that the crJudi Arab GovernjBf'nt are bound to import goods vie. Bahrain during the period of the agreement* If so, the Sa*udi Arab Government could not agree to it* They understand, hot ever, from the terms of the draft note regarding the stei mer n Ahia di n that the i udi Arab Government are not so bound. If that interpretation is correct, the be*udi Arab Government would vro »ose to add to the seventh uaragrawh of the draft note;- n it being understood that the Sa f udi Arab Govern^nt and their subjects are free to import goods to the coast of the la^ud.i nArab Kingdom bp tray of the Persian ^ulf via Bahrain and Its rorts, or by another way'. 6 .

Dated, Shabaan 5, 1354 November 2, 1935. From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrai n, letter i\io. U/DU4-l.a/13 dated 30th October 1935. The facts stated by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin regarding the customs duty on dates from Saouaia-Arabia are not correct. 2. The customs duty on dates is col lected according to a fixed tariff which has not been revised for several years. The duty, according to prices today, works out at approximateLy 12-g/b on Hassa dates, 10/b on Katii nates and lOyo on Basrah dates. 3. The suggestion that Basrah dates pay no or less duty is incorrect. it is true that the Bahrain govern ment proposes to substitute the fixed tariff by a 5J6 ad valorem duty on all dates imported To H. B. M r s Political Sgent, Bahrain. Sir, into- 2 - into Bahrain.

The action of the Saoudia-Atabia government in drawing attention to the possibility of a misunderstanding owing to an error in the draft agreement is much appreciated. It was the intention of ^ this government to reduce the 2 ^ transit duty by l/4, the duty will become 1 |^ ad- valorem.

Re drew attention to inaccuracy of Sa ! udi draft in this paragraph of word ”transhipped n which as also in our draft had been rendered ”transit” and proposed a paraphrase which I promised to study. His draft reads ”loaded and unloaded direct from ships into dhows and dhows into ships anchoring at Bahrain without being landed”. Phrase ”anchoring at Bahrain” appeared objectionable in view of consideration contained in your Despatch 214 of July 25th but J[l was2 . I was careful not to arouse suspicion by taking up point vigorously. I remarked that ^usuf Yasin had himself added words '.At Bahrain tT after words ^without being landed” and 1 thought their inclusion unnecessary. F(uad) could not agree. 4.

But in view of danger referred to in paragraph 3 of my despatch °14 you may accept 'at” if Fuad H amZ a raises any objection to this purely verbal word 'transhi ped' occurs however in four places in your notes and to avoid some repetition best course would be to add words '(that is loaded and unloaded direct from ships into dhov/s and dhows into ships anchoring off Bahrain)' between 'transhipped' and 'without being landed' at the end of paragraph 2 of first note. 1 am advised that this qualification equally apply to word 'tranship] ed' in other paragraphs. / 4 .Telegram:- R/35.

I am authorised to assure Your loyal Highness, on behalf of Hie Majesty’s Oovermaent in the tfnited Kingdom and the G-Overawiat of Bahrain, Fuat the authorities in Bahrain will not at any future time claim any duties whatsoever on goods shipped to or from ports in Baudi Arabia in ships calling at Bahrain when the goods in question are intended to be taken direct to their destination in the ships carrying them and not to be landed at Bahrain for re-export or trans-shipped without being landed. The permanent validity of this assurance will not be affected by any notification, which may be made in accordance with the paragraph numbered 7 in my note of today. ABahrain, Persian ^ulf.

His excellency will take no action until we hear officially from you. I think this letter was a contravention of the existing arrangement by which all such correspondence on official matters comes through you. Possibly the new Amir of hassa is not aware of this.

After Oomplimcnts, I have received an intimation from my Government that tne agreement, which was the result of the conference held in Banr&amp;in in Muharram 1354(April 1935), Detween the delegates of the a’udi Arab Kingdom and the delegates of Bahrain, has been signed.

Usual Ending.Confldpntif 1, PolitiCc.1 Agency, ^ahr^in, the 14th December 1335. No:C/60 7-1.a/13• From:- uieutenant-Colonel Gordon ^och, .Political Agent, Bahrain. To:- The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. V&lt; :rain Tranrit ^es . Flr » I have the honour ta^efer to the correspondence ending with letter No:,328 (2803/222/92) dated the 13th November 1935 from His M'jesty f s Charge d f Affaires at Jedda to His Mrjesty f s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, regarding the agreement which was arrived at at Bahrain between the Bahrain Government and the Sa f udi /rab Government with regard to transit dues, and to enclose a translation of a letter NoslOlO dated the 8th Ramadhan 1354 (5th December 1935) from the Amir of iiasa, S&amp;’ud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi, to His Excellency Shaikh Dir Hamad bin ^sa A1 Khalifah, who has sent it to me saying that he will take no action until he hears from me on the subject. 2. I would suggest that as soon as I am informed official ly of the completion of the agreement that, if His Majesty 1 * Minister at Jedda has no objection, I should be authorised to v/rite to the Amir of Hasa that, under instructions from His Majesty* s Government, I am informing him that I have commni- erted news of the signing of the agreement to the Bahrain Govern ment, rho will put the agreement into force at once. I am arranging with the Bahrain Government in the meantime to makevh&amp;t arrangements are necessary, I should be grateful for orders by telegram as it would be unfortunate If any delay In imr'lemerit ing the c groe ment were to be laid at the door either of ourselves or of the Bahrain Government. y 5. In this connection I would refer to letter No:6/l/l8 dated the j.7tn Ha^ab 1*554 (15th October 1^35) from Ihaikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert, in v/hich the Sa'udi Governift?nt contested the claim of His ?.fejesty f s Government that the ba^di Arab Government are not entitled to correspond direct on official matters with the Arab States in special relations with His Majesty 1 s Government. I do not think that the present letter is one to which exception can well be taken as the ^a^di Arab and Bahrain representatives were put into touch with each other by us and as the letter merely contains a reauest to put into operation locally the agreement which was reached. At the same time in principle it is open to objection, and I think that, if His Majesty’s Minister has no objection, our claim can best be emphasised by my communicating with the A.mir of Hasa as suggest ed in the second paragraph above. 4. It is probable that His excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad may ask whether there is any objection to his giving a polite reply and I suggest that he be authorised to acknowledge the letter courteously and to add that he understands that a communication on the subject is being addressed to the Amir of Hasa by the Political Agent. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential D # 0.No:C/609-1.a/13 16th December V dear Belgrave, Ylth refer With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter Koi970-S.F dated the ith December 1935 regarding the agreement *hich v?as arrived at at Bahrain between represent atives of the Bahrain and 6a f udl /rab Governments with regard to the Bahrain Transit dues, I write to inform you that notes were exchanged between His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda and the fa’udi Arab Government on the 16th November 1935# I hope to receive instructions regarding putting the agreement into force shortly, but think that in the meantime it wouxd be wise for the Bahrain Government to prepare (if that has not air* ady been done) any measures that may be necessary, so that when the time comes there will be no delay in giving effect to It Yours sincerely, Irympte Belgrave Psquire, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain.Telegram*- From:- To:- N 0 :- R/S7.

His Majesty’s Government cannot therefore object to publication of notes by Saudi Government.

I am disturbed about Point 2 of the telegram dated January 1st, No:l, from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and feel that before action is taken I should place two local consider ations before you. Shaikh would not Ithink have any objection to Saudi Government publishing both notices if they wish to do so. But I feel that Shaikh and his family may object strongly to notes being registered with League of Nations, of which Bahrain is not a member, as they are likely to regard bringing Bahrain thus within purview of League as weakening her position against Persian claims. In any case it would seem necessary to consult Shaikh and if matter gets out it may give certain persons opportunity to stir up demand for entry of Bahrain into League which might prove embarrassing both here and else where along Arab Littoral. = Political = jTelegram: XX.

Sir, Vith reference to previous correspondence ending with my printed despatch No.12 of January 5th relative to the recent agreement regarding Bahrain transit dues and connected matters, I have the honour to state that in the course of a telephone conversation on December 30th, I told Fuad Bey Hamza that I was postponing my reply about the suggested publication of the notes exchanged pending receipt of your instructions. Fuad Bey there upon adverted to some local complication which had been disclosed in correspondence between the Acting Governor of Hasa and the Shaikh of Bahrain. We agreed to discuss the whole matter at our next meeting on January 2nd. 2. At this meeting I understood Fuad Bey to say that the Governor of Hasa had forwarded copies of the notes to the Shaikh; that the latter had used in his reply hesitant and inconclusive language regarding the agreement; and that in a second letter the Shaikh had spoken of a report having been made to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3. I told Fuad Bey that I thought I could explain tiny appearance of hesitancy on the part of the Shaikh. There was no doubt, I said, that the agreement embodied in the exchange of notes was complete and binding but there appeared to have been some misunderstanding as to when the agreement should come into force. I told Fuad Bey unofficially what had passed on this subject, so far as I knew it from the telegrams exchanged and expressed the view that any misunderstanding had already / Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., etc., etc., etc.already been cleared up ill 4. Fuad Bey spoke of the direct correspondence between the Acting Governor of Hasa and the Shaikh of Bahrain as having passed in the ordinary course. I said that he knew my views about direct correspondence on official matters between the Saudi Government and the Persian Gulf States with which His Majesty^ Government were in special relations. Apart from the consideration that we were responsible for the foreign relations of those States, such correspondence was apt to lead to confusion, as it had done in this case and on other occasions in the past. I admitted that correspondence between local authorities on routine matters might be necessary and admissible e.g. I should not object to correspondence on such matters bet ween the Director of Customs inHasa and subordinate authorities in Bahrain but I considered correspondence about a formal agreement to be undesirable. The longest way round, I intima ted. was the shortest way home. 5. I purposely couched my remonsttance in mild language, as I do not know to what extent it is usual for the Governor of Hasa and the Shaikh of Bahrain to correspond direct about important official matters, and as in this case the Acting Governor did not apparently so much initiate a discussion as enter into correspondence v/ith the Shaikh regarding the bringing into force of an agreement already made through the proper channels. On the other hand, it seems to me important to lose no opportunity of combating the growing tendency of the Saudi Government to defend the view that they are entitled to have direct relatione with the Governments of Persian Gulf States in special relations with His Majesty’s Government. 6. I have not yet informed Fuad ney in tne sense of tile second paragraph of your telegram ITo.l of January 1st as paragraph /r l —kJ • \V0 paragraph 2 of India Office telegram No.33 of January 2nd to the Political Resident seemed to leave open a bare possibility that the Bahrain Grovernment might still object to the publica tion of the notes. As it is desirable, however, not to incur suspicion by delaying a communication which can hardly fail to be an assent to publication, I addressed to the Political Resident and repeated to Bahrain on January 5th the telegram enclosed in my printed despatch No.12 of that date. 7» I am preparing the texts called for in the last sentence of your telegram No.l of January 1st and hope to send them home by the next following bag, with a short note showing how far the Arabic texts differ from the English, for the reasons explained in Mr.Calvert’s despatch No.328 of November 19th and the preceding telegrams. 8.

Ab you know, we agreed to make the modification wrich you suggested in the wording of our draft telegram to Jedda on the question of registration and publication so as to render it leas categorical* We think, however, that it may be useful to explain our position clearly so as to avoid further difficulties In natters of this sort. 3* Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations obliges member States to register M ©very treaty or international engagement” entered into. The obligation thus imposed on His Na^eoty f s Government is absolute and the only question which arises is whether the instrument or instruraente in any particular care constitute an 'international engagement” for the purpose of this Article* n the case of the Bahrain transit ueo agreoaent, we decided tliat it did definitely constitute an international ongageaent/ Clauson, Esq*engagement within the meaning of Article 18 ana once that point had been settlor there could, of course, be no question of subsequently reversing; the decision on account of some outside political consideration such as the attitude of the Bahrain Oov'emiiK nt. 4* Consequently the original wor-ling in the draft telegram to Jecide rhich enclosed in hl« letter K. 7417 / 191/25 0 f the 31st December to you 1*e., ’’they (the notes) will have to be registered with the League of Nations and published#•••**•** was technically correct* It was not, of course, our Intention (aiid I do not think that the wording of the original draft c ml ; be so Interpreted) to suggest that there was an obligati&gt;n to register all exchanges of notes; our obligation towards the League as pointed out above only refers to exchanges 01 notes (such as those about the Bahrain transit dues) wtdeh in the opinion of our technical authorities niust be hel to constitute an international engagement* within the meaning of Article 18 of the Covenant* &gt;• ff' have looked up the ease of the ’-'urrcx&gt; i—Khost exchange of notes in 1934; but we find that it in fact involve! no departure from our general attitude. The eaee was admittedly a borderline one and although we inclined to the view hat it cane within Article 18 of the Covenant, we did not feel that we eoul i register the notes against the wishes of the other party to the agreement, particularly in view of the reasons given. The Kurram-Khost exchange of notes, however, like all other*, was considered entirely on its own merits, and the fact that it was not held necessary to register it does not, of course, constitute any sort of precedent. 6 .

Ine Shaikh o.: Bahrain and tne Governor of Has a do not correspond at ail on important official matters (though they exchange greetings and occasionally do little kindnesses to each other f s friends) and the present Shaikh is, I think, punctilious about braving to my notice any attempt to drav him into corresponcence on iormal affairsi as, for example, in the present case(see the corresponcence ending with the second, paragraph of your ttiegram No.1029 dated the 19th December 1 j35 ). 3. I am a little anxious about tne possible effect of Sir Andrew Byan’s mention to Fuad Bey that he would not object to correspondence on routine matters between tne Director of Customs sad fcne in Hasa and subordinate authorities in Bahrain. tne Director f Customs and his subordinates in Bahrain do not correspond direct with any of the aa»udi Customs authorities, and X feel that ( though elsewhere such a course would be perfectly natural) it would be preferable not to suggest, even casually, that they should do so here, has in tae circumstances on this Coast such correspondence might easily lead to difficulties. 4. I write this with some diffidence, but I feel sure tnat Sir Andrew will appreciate that it is very easy to disturb our curious f Iive and let live 1 state of affairs. ^nourtble -imt-Colonel X.C.Pov.le, C.B.E., D-v 1 A x j ~ 1 j ^ Political ^esident in tne Persian Bushire.I)&gt;Q.NO.C/30 .

We agreed that the test way to prevent any possible ill effects of direct correspondence between the Director of Customs in Hasa and subordinate authorities in Bahrain(i.e. Director of Customs), should this begin, would be for the Bahrain Director to be informed that he should show any such corres pondence to Belgrave, who on behalf of the Shaikh will show it to you.

Mr.Eden doubts whether any objection need be taken to the fact that the reply &gt;vhich the Saudi Arabian Government propose to address to the Persian Government contains no reference to the position of His Majesty’s Government in Bahrain. This proposed reply merely states that the Saudi Arabian Government know of no Persian rights in Bahrain and the question of any other rights does not arise. Moreover, there is no question but that the Shaikh is the Ruler of Bahrain, even though his foreign relations are in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, and the above-mentioned notes can f Mr.Eden is advised, be correctly described as constituting an agreement between Saudi ~ TT , Arabia/ ihe Under Secretary of State, Ini ia Office .
