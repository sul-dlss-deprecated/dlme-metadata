On 9 th October 1869, Syud Naseer bin Thoweynee warned the Moonshee of the Agency of the likelihood of his making a hostile demonstration against Muscat. On 1 14th October Colonel Disbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat, requested Captain Elton, Commanding It. M. Clyde, to leave his usual anchorage at Muscat Cove and take up a position near the Julalee Port on the south-east of the town so as to prevent the enemy from landing. This he did on October 15th, when immediately without provocation the garrison opened fire on him with matchlocks for the space of half an hour to the imminent risk of the jives of his crew and to the dishonor of the British flag which was flying all the time. 2. Captain Elton reported the matter in person to Colonel Disbrowe. He also wrote:— “The firing- was continued after I left tlie vessel in my gig- with the ensign Hying and passing close under the walls of the fort to report the matter to you. I refrained from taking any notice of this indignity until 1 knew your wishes, otherwise we could have silenced them in a few minutes.” Colonel Disbrowe demanded, in the name of Her Majesty’s Government, of Khulelee what explanation he, in the absence of Syud Azan, could offer. 3. Khulelee urged that the Chide had taken up an unaccustomed position, that she was taken for an enemy, and that the firing was without his knowledge or instigation. He also asserted that the Clyde had first attacked the fort, a statement which Captain Elton declared to he utterly false, as also the other assertion that the position was an unusual one. Nor could Captain Elton believe that the Clyde was not recognized, as she had been for six months lying within a mile of the fort and her appearance could not possibly lie mistaken; anyhow the firing on Her Majesty’s flag at 400 yards was unjustifiable. He added that he was only restrained from resenting the insult on the spot by the knowledge of the unprotected position of the Political Agent and British subjects on shore. 4. Colonel Disbrowe thanked Captain Elton for his coolness under trying • No. 592 , dated isth October 1869, circumstances, and reported* the whole affair to and No. dated mth October the Bombay Government. At the time of the 1869, occurrence Syud Azan and Sheikh Salih had pro ceeded to the interior towards Jaalan. The Bombay Government submitted t to Govern ment the whole correspondence. The Bombay Government forwarded t to Government the Political Agent, Muscat’s telegram, which concluded (after giving the main facts as above):— f No. 466, dated 30th October 1860. 0. X 18th October 1869. “ Explanation demanded. Reply imperious and false. Matters may come to a crisis. Refer to my previous written warning. I continue in shore. What are the Government wishes? Major Ross will send me answer across express. Please send out Dalhousie. No use particulars by mail.” 6 . The next day Bombay Government again telegraphed to Government:— “ Referring to telegram from Colonel Disbrowe reporting that Clyde had been fired on, Colonel Pelly has been directed to proceed to Muscat, and if apology and reparation be not imme diately given, to instruct Colonel Disbrowe to embark and remove British subjects and property. Colonel Pelly has been cautioned that these instructions have been given on the understanding that Disbrowe has not been misinformed. Enquiry has been made of Senior Naval Officer at Trincomalee whether any, and what, ships of war at that Station. Letter will be despatched to Aden for the Commander of the first ship of war arriving there, informing him that the services of a small squadron are urgently required, and requesting him to proceed to Jask, where instructions from the \ iceroy will meet him.”\ V •( 2 ) 7. The Viceroy telegraphed, 19th October: « Has Dopin' left Bombay ? Where are the other Guu-boate of the Indian Squadron ?” and to Naval Officer Commanding at Trincomalee : a What vessels are at your station ?” It appeared that the Daphne was in Bombay Harbour, the had gone to Suez, no ships of war were at Irincomuh ( • 8 . Accordingly * the Viceroy telegraphed to * 20 th October 1860 . ^he Governor, Bombay :— « Send no instructions to Disbrowe. Telegraph again to Pelly to go to Muscat at once. “ If Clt/&gt;/e has been wantonly fired at, let Pelly demand apology and explanation. If refused, authorize Pelly to order Agent to withdraw temporarily from Muscat. But perma nent withdrawal of British Agency very undesirable. “ If Pellv thinks Disbrowe has acted with imprudence or want of judgment, or seems to desire to pick a quarrel, let Pelly replace him at once by another Agent. “ Desire Pelly to use every effort to bring the matter to such a peaceful conclusion as is consistent with the honor of the British ilag. “Tell Pelly that we cannot take any step as to recognition of Azan, or any Ruler of Muscat, until we receive a full report from him as to state of affairs m Oman. “No ship of war at Trincomalee. “Send Dapkne to Muscat, calling at Jask, and support her with one or two small vessels if possible. ,, 9 . The Bombay Government answered as follows:— “ Your instructions mostly anticipated, but will be repeated. No instructions given to Disbrowe and Pelly instructed to proceed at once to Muscat. This has been telegraphed to Disbrowe! Explanation will be demanded if circumstances, in Pelly’s opinion, justify it, and if not Given relations will be temporarily suspended; but we do not think Pelly should be authorized to remove Disbrowe. The latest dispatches will show that there has been mu&lt; i misunderstanding between them, and that in some respects admitting Disbrowe unfit Pel y has much to blame. No doubt Pelly will report against Disbrowe, and he will be practically superseded until the orders of Government removing him, or Pelly telegraphs. I am quite prepared to remove him under any circumstances, but think it would be very objectionable to give that power to Pellv. The remainder of your telegram answered by my last. Pelly is informed already we fsicj his Report. Our situation as regards vessels of war is most unfortunate.” The Viceroy agreed that Colonel Pelly should not remove Colonel Disbrowe, hut remarked «the sooner another Agent goes to Muscat the better.” 10. It appeared (on the 21st October) that the Daphne could not he got ready for 10 days, as her engines had been taken to pieces for repairs and she required examination, having been ashore; orders were issued to have her got ready with all speed. Thereupon the Viceroy telegraphed to Sir L. Heath at Suez : “ On account of news from Muscat I ordered Daphne to go from Bombay. She cannot start for ten days, can you send one or two small vessels to Muscat ? I telegraphed on chance of your being at Suez. Place vessels under Colonel Felly’s orders only.” fhis the Commodore answered, “ sent Daphne, will give similar orders to vessel next arriving, and the next after if necessary. Cannot place vessels under Pelly.” 11. On 1 st November the Viceroy telegraphed to Governor, Bombay:— “ Commodore says cannot place vessels under Pelly. What instructions has Daphne received from Commodore? When does she start?” The Governor, Bombay, replied :— “ Nymph sailed this morning. Ships are not put under Pelly, as I was aware of tenacity of Admiralty as to putting officers of Navy under orders of Indian Government. “ Daphne requested to proceed to Muscat and to act in concert with Pelly; my instruc tions to him sent you by post. Daphne left Wednesday evening.” t \The Secretary of State was informed * by telegraph ol the attack on the * 25 th October 1869. Clyde, and the measures taken thereon. 12. In their No. 471, dated 4th November 1869, the Bombay Government reported the instructions they issued to Commander Douglas of Her Majesty’s Daphne. Their letter ran— &lt;c I am desired by His Kxcelleiicy, under instructions from the ^ iceroy, to request that you will proceed immediately with the vessel under your command to Muscat. (&lt; Information has been received by the Government from the Political Agent at that place, that Her Majesty's Gun-boat Clyde has been wantonly fired upon from one of the forts, and it is alleged that this insult was offered to the British flag with a perfect knowledge of the character of the vessel, and on the pretext which is false, and made use of now only to excuse the outrage. “ Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, has been instructed to proceed to Muscat for the purpose of enquiry into the circumstances, and, if necessary, of demanding an apology and redress; and you are requested to put yourself into communication with that officer and be guided by his advice and instructions. “ His Excellency has entire confidence in the prudence and discretion of Colonel Pelly, and has therefore not thought it necessary to fetter him with precise instructions, as he has no doubt that, while he will not hesitate to take such steps as will uphold the honor of his Govern ment, he will adopt every means to avoid the necessity of having recourse to force. “ His Excellency feels sure that you will willingly second him in either course which it may be found necessary to adopt, but requests you to bear in mind that even if it be suffi ciently shown that the“authorities of Muscat have been guilty of the outrage alleged, it is his desire that no hostile measures should be used until all hope of otherwise obtaining redress has failed. “ I am instructed to impress on you that, in the opinion of the Government, no operations on land should be undertaken unless absolutely necessary, and that no portion of your force should be disembarked. Her Majesty’s Gun-boats Clyde and Hugh Rose, of the Bombay Marine, are placed under your orders. “ A piratical attack having lately been made on the town of Bahrein, which led to the plunder of many British subjects and the destruction of a great amount of valuable property belonging to them, it may be considered advisable by yourself and Colonel Pelly that advan tage should be taken of the presence of your vessel in the Gulf to proceed to that place in order to punish the Chiefs implicated in this signal breach of the maritime truce, should you, after careful consideration with Colonel Pelly, be of opinion that the force at your disposal is sufficient to enable you to carry out promptly and completely the objects of such expedition. 1 am instucted to request you will lose no time in communicating with the Government by telegraph, but it is His Excellency’s desire that you should take no further steps for this purpose until he has had an opportunity of communicating with the Viceroy and giving you further instructions m this respect.” 13. This was answered by Foreign Department No. 1606, 14th November 1869 “ His Excellency in Council does not understand the remark in the 4th paragraph of your letter to Commander Douglas. On the 20 th of October precise instructions for Colonel Pelly’s guidance were telegraphed to 11 is Excellency the Governor of Bombay, who replied by tele graph on the 21 st, that the instructions had been mostly anti- “His Excellency has entire oonfi- c ipated, but would be repeated. Under these circumstances, deuce * * * * precise instructions. Excellency in Council desires that the remark quoted in the margin may be explained. M With reference to your letter No. 466, dated 30th October, His Excellency in Council learns from the public newspapers that the affair at Muscat has been amicably settled, and that the Muscat authorities have made an apology on board the Dalhousie. No report to this effect has been received by the Government of India either by letter or telegraph, and I am to request that a full report of what has been done may be submitted without delay.” This was tbe last letter in tbe despatch to the Secretary of State, ^ T o. 23, dated 16th November 1869. 14. The Bombay Government in their No. 479, dated 10th November 1869, forwarded to Government copies of letters from Colonel Disbrowe and Colonel Belly. The latter reported his arrival at Muscat on October 30th. He received from Colonel Disbrowe copies ol all his letters to the Bombay Govern ment relative to the firing on the Clyde, and had a lengthened interview on hoard( 4 ) From these The chief are probably the cases of the Prince of Wales, of Sulhmn, the man whose servant, Raymut, was lately beaten, and Abdool Luteef, whose house was lately searched for tobacco. the Dalhousie with Sheikli Naseer, Azan hm Gheis’s Secretary, sources Colonel Pelly gathered the following particulars « The irritation between the Political Agent and the Muscat authoriti® h^jm Oetol*r last reached such a pitch, owing to various causes ^ nlaint on both sides, which have been duly brought to notice, that all communication had ceased. Whilst matters were in this state the Moonshee of the Agency received information, erroneous as it subsequently turned out, that Syud Naseer, the usur pe r of Gwadur, was about to attack Muscat by sea. n this Colonel Disbrowe, without acquainting any of the local officials ordered t^ purpose of defending the town, to take up a position immediately below the Julalee The affair then occurred as related. 15. Colonel Pelly regretted that « • fha cf.Up nf feel in ^s then existing, Colonel Disbrowe should have altered the position of the 1 Clyde without o afa, ology board the SMouJ expressed by Sheikh Naseer and hve “ P e “ Pe'^ ':::r fes H Colonel Pelly, ^^5“ tS,' t™ Vetovl.nenl of imlia ^ The oral apology set forth that the tiring of the matehlockmen was without the know- ledo-e or consent of those who tendered it. Khulelee, in his apology, expressed regret h r the &amp; affair which has had place so unawares and in an improper manner. e repu ia &lt;- ‘ knowledo-e of the firing being intentional, and said that when he heard of it, he ordered cease He complained of Colonel Disbrowe not having informed him of the proposed change m the Ctyte’* position, contending that it was a strange one, and that the vessel was no recognized.” 10. To Colonel Felly’s report was «appended a translation of a letter from Azan bin Gheis without English date, hut received on October the 30th. In it he complained that Colonel Dishrowe’s conduct of business i«&gt;s m iTnianner contrary to the rules of Treaty,’ and he hinted that the Agent might be reportmg to his Government what was contrary to facts, for that there was really no oppression or insult towards British subjects in Muscat. On the contrary His Hi ghness professed himseff to b anxious for the comfort and ease f of the poor people. Being unable to find fault with me n this respect/ he added, ‘ Colonel Disbrowe took to some other means, the object of. which 1 do not understand, but which be may make the subject of complaint. For instance, he one day sent the Gun-boat towards the east fort/ Then followed a repetition of Ins subordinate s version of the story, except that he did not say that the vessel was mistaken for an enemy. The men in the fork according to him, were strangers. The Clyde, when he wrote was still in the position distasteful to him, and he feared that circumstances, such as he had detailed, weiehke y to cause disturbance/’ 17. t No. 601, dated 20th October 1869. „ 617, „ 27th .. 632, ., 30th „ „ Colonel Disbrowe in his letters t explained his conduct, referred to rumours concerning the defeat ol .A-zan in the south, and his treachery towards Syf bin Sooleynian, tlm jubal Ukhtliur Chief. He resented the attitude of Colonel Pelly who had refrained from making known to him his mstmetions from Government or discussing official matters with him. He admitted, however, “ that he was requested to be present, and was present when the deputation from Khulelee tendered their apology. He also dissented from the course pursued by Colonel Be y, because in his opinion Khulelee ought to have been made to apologize in person, because the deputation was composed of persons unfitted to apologize, because promises of good-will and respect wc been repeatedly broken, because the apology received seemed to cover and expiate a former insults, and because the actual aggressors had not been punished. He despairs of being able to work satisfactorily with Colonel Pelly whose subordinate he was, and mentioned a lummu current in Muscat that whatever he (Colonel Disbrowe) wrote, Colonel Pelly wrote the contrary. Colonel Belly’s influence was, he thought, by some ascribed to the belief that he was related to the Queen.”s ( 5 ) 18. The letter Xo. 479, of 10 th November, of the Bombay Government, was answered by Xo. 1656, dated 20th November 1869, which ran:— “ The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council has very carefully considered the docu ments regarding 1 the apologies which have so far been received, as well as'the letter from Azan bin Gheis which Colonel Felly received on 30th October. His Excellency in Council observes that in that from Khulelee the excuse is still persevered in that the C///rIe was not'recognized bv the matchlockmen who fired upon her. From the statement made by Captain Elton, &amp; however which forms an enclosure to your letter No. 46G, dated 30th October last, His Excellency in Council is inclined to doubt whether the matchlockmen could have been ignorant of the character and nationality of the vessel. She had been lying in the harbour for the space of six months previously, and her ensign was flying during the whole time that the firing lasted. Khulelee has accounted for his apology not being sealed by saying that he did not happen to have his seal by his side at the time that he wrote it. This may possibly be true, but His Excellency in Council would have been glad to have been favoured, both on this point and on the other parts of the correspondence under notice, with the opinion of the Government of Bombay. In a telegram dated 9th November to Colonel Felly, which was received with some other telegrams unofficially •from the Governor by the Viceroy, it appears that Ilis Excellency the Governor of Bombay stipulated that the apologv from Azan bin Gheis should not be evasive, but real and satisfactory; that it should be understood as a sincere apology by the inhabitants of Muscat; and that it should be conveyed through the proper channel. It would have greatly assisted the Government of India* in coming to ^ con clusion as to the proper course to be adopted if the Government of Bombay had expressed its views on the adequacy of the apology, as well as on all the proceedings which have taken place in connection with them. a The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council is of opinion that it would have been better had Khulelee's apology been duly sealed with the State Seal, and had it been submitted by him in person. But as Colonel Felly on this matter should be the best judge of the spirit and of the manner in which it was tendered, His Excellency in Council is willing to accept it if that officer considers that, despite its defects, no evasion was intended. If it be practicable His Excellency in Council would still desire that Colonel Felly should take such steps as he may consider advisable to have the State Seal of Muscat affixed to the document. You are requested to forward a copy of this letter to Colonel Felly without delay.' 19. The Secretary of State was apprized by telegram of 20th November 1869:— “ Khulelee, in absence of Azan bin Gheis, apologized by letter to Felly at Muscat on October 30th, and sent deputation on board Dalhoune with same object. Formal apology pro mised in due course from Azan bin Gheis. Provided Felly considers K hide lee's apology’ in no respect evasive, I have agreed to accept it.' Syud Azan apologized to Colonel Felly on 3rd November (No. 506, 30th November 1869, Bombay Government, to Government of India). He said: “ You have already heard of what occurred on the part of the garrison at Muscat on the occasion of Colonel Disbrowe sending his ships towards the eastern fort to a station which was not the anchorage for vessels. I was not present there; and if 1 had been, such a thing would perhaps not have happened. I am sorry to be thus made ashamed before the high Government for whom I entertain the greatest respect, and would not wish anything to take place which would give them offence. I have enjoined on the people of Oman and the inhabitants of the towns in general to show every respect and consideration to all connected with that Govern ment. I request that you will communicate this from me to the Government, and state that I beg to be excused and forgiven, and to get their good-will. I have already written to them in detail of what had happened.' Tbis was considered satisfactory and accepted unconditionally. 20 : A correspondence by telegraph between Colonel Felly and tbe Govern ment of Bombay was kept up between 1st November and 10 th November with reference to the insult to the Clyde, the apologies of Khulelee and Syud Aznu, tbe removal of tbe Arab Commander in the Fort, tbe necessity of proceeding to Bahrein, and tbe expediency of recognizing Azan’s Government. These were all sent up together demi-offieially to tbe Viceroy on November 11th, 1869. 21 . On tbe 10 th December, Bombay Government telegraphed: “ Referring to your letter No. 1656, of November 20th, Colonel Felly telegraphs the State Seal to Khulelee s document was offered, but I declined it, because it was an autograph apology from Br ( 6 ) Secretary savs Viceroy consiaers ° ^ s , ^ affixed to tne ditionully; kvor mo »-itH «nal W whom we shouU rather required but I think it would only lend State im l )m t d „ tend to exclude from ruling.

The Government of India wrote to Bombay (No. 1A., dated 23rd October 1869):— 'With reference to recent reports regarding 1 affairs at Muscat, His Lxcelkm \ the ^ keio\ of Ids relations with Azan bin Gheis, appears able to procure. „ . , , « His Excellency in Council accordingly desires that, as soon as one of Her Majesty's rule^and, in the event of his overthrow, what are the probabilities of any member of the late ruling family of Muscat acquiring sovereign power.” '27. To this Colonel Felly’s letter to Bombay Government (No. 202, dated Srd November 1869) was substantially an answer. (Submitted m JS o. 0 ) 6 , dated 20th November, from Bombay Government.) He invited attention to a memorandum of instructions to Captain Douglas ot the Daphne, shoningjo him how the affair of the Clyde stood on the 1st November, and suggesting v should be the movements of the vessels of war at his disposal against Bahrein. His proposals on the latter head were, to touch at Henjam for the oideis of Government and to make that island the rendezvous M hen matters had been settled at Bahrein, he was anxious that the squadron should pass down the Pirate Coast from Aboothabee to Has el Khyma, and thence that Captain Don Mas should go to Muscat, by w hich time he hoped that the result of Azan bin Gheis’s expedition against the Bcni-boo-Ali tribe being known might deter mine the question of his recognition by the British Government. The British subjects in Muscat were very generally questioned by Colonel Pellv as to the influence of the priestly faction on them, and they answered that they had no complaints to make of personal oppression on the part ol the Government. They had, however, two grievances . j ’j'bc Mahometan religious law of debtor and creditor vas enfoiccd. •luAlii .—The subjects were forbidden to buy tobacco, and so the interests of British traders in that commodity were injuriously affected. But in this matter, so long as Azan bin Gheis was not authorized, and so Ion', therefore, as the Sultan was not bound by treaty engagements, Colonel PelTv thought that the British Government had a right to interfere, lie die not believe in Colonel Disbrowe’s apprehension of violence to British subjects being well founded ; but to avoid all risk, during his absence at Bahrein, he leit the Dalhoude in the harbour, which was capable, if necessary, of accommodat ing all British subjects. If Syud Azan bin Gheis should succeed m his present expedition in the south, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so consi derably as to he able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could. There would he still danger from the threatened attack of the Waliabees, which the Ameer of Nejd m all probability u ould undertake in the hope of recapturing Beraymee and avenging the insult which the unprovoked assault on that fort constituted. The Sultan s adherents did not dread the consequences. There were not supplies or water lor a large torce, a small one, they urged, would not venture, and under any circumstances Azan bin Gheis had the advantage, as he was able to choose where he would await and oppose the enemy. What the result of the campaign might lie the Resident did not dare to foretell. But he did not think that the contingency of such a conflict, which was in the nature of a foreign war, should bar the British Government from acknowledging a Ruler who had been successtul m( 8 ) _ -- ^ * arms in nearly every part of the Muscat territory, who was a thorough soldier, who was supported hy the priests, who had held his own for a twelve month, despite many difficulties, and whose chief rival was beyond the seas. The alternative, therefore, in his opinion, lay between recognizing Azan bin Gheis and indefinitely prolonging the present state of affairs. If he were recognised, Colonel Pelly said that, of course, he would be expected to confirm former treaties. The subject of the public sale of tobacco in the bazaars of Muscat might prove a delicate one to discuss. Notwithstanding Azan bin Gheis’s improved prospects, Colonel Felly’s own predilection was in favor of the rule of some member of the Syud Saeed branch, but he did not see what member had a chance of regaining power at present. With despatch No. 203, dated 4th November 1869, Colonel Felly sent a translation of Azan bin Gheis’s apology for the firing on the Clyde, and inti mated his opinion that it was satisfactory. Colonel Felly also announced his departure, with the Daphne and Clyde, for Bahrein. The Nymph and the Hugh Rose were to follow and join him at Hen jam. lie anticipated the necessity of a long blockade. 28. The Bombay Government (No. 475, of 9th November 1869) com mented on Colonel Felly’s No. 191, 9th October 1869. They said:— “ The recognition* of Syud Salem, referred to by Colonel Felly, is. His Excellency the Governor in Council thinks, a warning how we should * When he^ had been Sultan only a r( ‘cognize Syud Azan in the present state of affairs. He has retained power for a year, but only owing to the interference of the British Government, first, in preventing Syud Toorkee’s departure, and secondly, by for bidding any operation by sea. But even thus His Excellency in Council considers Syud AzaiFs authority so precarious that it would be most unwise to recognise his government at the present moment. “ It remains to be seen whether the Wahabee Ameer undertakes operations against Muscat, and with what result. Under any circumstances, the Governor in Council does not think that our recognition would in any way so confirm Syud Azan’s authority over the tribes as to affect in any degree his prospects of successful resistance.” The letters, Nos. 625 and625A., of 25th and 29th October 1869, from Colo nel Disbrowe (in No. 511, 23rd November, from Bombay Government), expressed his opinions on the state of affairs. 29. Colonel Felly (No. 205, 12th November 1869) reported that he had left Muscat in 11. M.’s S. Daphne and arrived at Henjam Telegraph Station. He proceeded— “ Syud Salem, late Sultan of Muscat, communicated with me from Kishm, and desired to visit me at Hemjam; accordingly he arrived by boat yesterday, and has since paid me two unofficial visits. “ He spoke to me at great length concerning the present condition of Arabian affairs, and asked if Government would object to his putting to sea with hostile intent. I repeated to him the orders of Government on this question, and added that both Syud Toorkee and His High ness the Sultan of Zanzibar had already been required to refrain from any attack by sea. “ Syud Salem stated that friendly communications had passed between himself and the Wahabee Ameer, and that the latter professed to be en route himself towards the Muscat fron tier. But Syud Salem more than doubted whether the Ameer would himself accompany the expedition further than Lahsa, the rather so since the Ameer fears being long absent from his own capital, where his brother Saood is still on the watch to supplant him. “ Syud Salem considered that, if the Ameer himself led the expedition, the Chieftains along the Pirate Coast would probably aid him, and the position of Azan would become critical. “ If, on the contrary, the Ameer should send a force under a Lieutenant, it was, in Syud Salem's opinion, doubtful whether the expedition would succeed. “ As regards the position of Azan, Syud Salem was of opinion that he (Azan) had been unexpectedly successful. He added that this success was due in great part to stratagem, but he admitted that, in regard to the majority of the Muscat territories, Syud Azan's position was more than ordinarily strong.”( 0 ) 30. On 8 th December 1869, Colonel Felly telegraphed from Angaum “ Azan writes and Major Ross confirms Azan’s success over Beni-boo-Ali. I believe he rules all ‘Oman/ and has only to meet possibility of external war with Wahabees wherein chances are even. Azan’s government popular among Bedouins, but disliked by townsmen. My own stedfast views are known to Government in favor of the old branch, but circumstances change with time, and I am unable to advise better than recognition of Azan; at the same time, my acquaintance with Arabs would not permit me to commit myself to predicating permanence in any Arab arrangement whatsoever. The only advantages in recognizing Azan now instead of hereafter are that Her Majesty’s Ships of War are present to represent our power, and that by recognition we close irritation with unrecognised Government. My letter No. 202, 3rd November, summarises my estimate of situation. 31. The Government of India acknowledge No. 506, of 20 th November 1869, of Bombay Government, with the following remarks and instructions:— “ 2. His Excellency in Council concurs with Colonel Felly in considering that the apology of Azan bin Gheis, dated 1st November 18B9, for the outrage on the Clyde, is satisfac tory, and accordingly authorizes Colonel Felly to accept unconditionally. The apology would, no doubt, have been more complete if the State Seal had been attached to it, as suggested in my letter No. 1656, dated 20 th November, with respect to the apology from Khulelee ; but His Excellency in Council is of opinion that it is now perhaps unnecessary to insist on this. “ 3 . His Excellency in Council approves of the action of Colonel Felly in leaving the Dalhousie in the Muscat Harbour during his absence at Bahrein. “4. In his letter No. 202, of 3rd November, Colonel Felly reports that, from all he can learn, our subjects at Muscat have no complaints of personal oppression to make against the priestly rule. Colonel Felly, however, gives no information as to the feelings entertained by the subjects of Muscat towards their present Government; but he considers that if Azan bin Gheis succeed in his expedition against the Beni-boo-Ali tribe, he will hold the territories of Muscat with a firmer grasp than we could expect from any other aspirant to power. \\ hat may be the chance of Azan permanently retaining his rule in the event of a Wahabee invasion. Colonel Felly is not prepared to say; but he states that, under present circumstances, no member of the Syud Saeed branch has a reasonable chance of regaining power, or would be more likely to retain it against the Wahabees than Azan. Under these circumstances, he is of opinion that matters are come to a point at which we have simply to elect between recognising Azan or protracting indefinitely the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. “ 5 . His Excellency in Council observes from your letter No. 475, dated 9th November, that His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council considers Syud Azan’s authority so precarious that it would be most unwise to recognise his Government at the present moment. No opinion is given in your letter under reply as to how far the later information supplied by Colonel Felly may have influenced these views of His Excellency the Governor in Council; nor do you express any opinion in your letter No. 511, of 23rd November, on the less favourable report of Azan’s position and prospects made by Colonel Disbrowe. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council would have been glad if he had been favored with a reply to my letter No. 1A., of 23rd October, and with the opinion of the Bombay Govern ment, based on the latest and most reliable information, as to the probability or otherwise of Azan bin Gheis maintaining his rule, or of his being supplanted either by a member oi the late ruling family or by any other Chief or Power. “ 6 . Judging, however, from such information as has been laid before him, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council is of opinion that the time is approaching when it will be necessary to take some steps for the formal recognition of a Government in Muscat. In a telegram received on the 9 th instant, Colonel Felly states that, in his opinion, the Government of Azan is popular with the Bedouins, but is disliked by the people of the town. This information, however, is not in sufficient detail, nor is its bearing on the permanence or otherwise of Azan’s rule sufficiently clear, to enable the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to decide on the expediency of formally recognising the Government of Azan. His Excellency in Council, accordingly, desires that, after the operations at Bahrein are concluded. Colonel Felly should return to Muscat and endeavor to make himself acquainted with the feelings of the people of Muscat on the subject of Azan’s rule, as far as opportunities of quietly obtaining information may present themselves. Should Colonel Felly be of opinion that there is nothing in the internal affairs of the Government of Muscat to render it probable that Azan may be soon dethroned by an internal revolution, His Excellency the \ ieeroy and Governor-General in Council, on receipt of Colonel Felly’s report, would not be indisposed formally to recognise Azan bin Gheis, and to authorise Colonel Felly to inform Azan, or, in his absence, Khulelee, the Deputy Governor, at an official interview, that His Excellency in Council has watched with interest the establishment of the power of Azan bin Gheis, which has at length given hope of a settled Government within the Muscat territories, and that His Excellency in Council has much pleasure in continuing with him those relations of friendship which have so long subsisted between the British Government and the Muscat State.r ( 10 ) “7 IIis Excellency in Council does not overlook the possibility of Azan bin Gheis sustain ing reverses at the hands of the Wahabees; but His E-llency i^^^ -th Colonel Felly that the fact of a menaced war with a foreign power ought not to de^r u^ trom the recognition of a Chief who has succeeded in establishing hls £ himself as de facto Ruler for a considerable time, and who is the on y Unet ot whorn it can oe said that there is at present any reasonable expectation that he will be able to maintain his nower ' The continuance of our Agent at Muscat in the exercise of Consular and pohtica powers and, above all, the acceptance of apologies from Azan bin &lt;&gt;hc “ [ u v gu bieets on the Clyde, are of themselves a qualified recognition ot him as the Ruler and'the course which His Excellency in Council would propose to authorise Colonel Felly to pursue would be only a more open and explicit declaration ot an acknowledg ment already indirectly made. inn “ 8 . His Excellency in Council does not share the opinion expressed by Colonel le ly that, under present circumstances, and until Azan bin Gheis be formally recognized as Ruler of Muscat, he is free of treaty engagements towards the British Governmen . e 111 which the British Government is directly a contracting party with the Muscat State must be held to be in full force, notwithstanding any changes in the internal constitution of the Muscat Government or in the person of the Ruler. It is impossible that our treaties can be considered in abevance while we have continuously maintained a Resident Agent at Muscat and insisted on the* rights and privileges which are secured to us by these treaties. “9 With respect to Colonel Felly's remarks on the interdict placed by the Muscat Government on the sale and use of tobacco, I am to observe that, although we may by friendly remonstrance point out the impropriety and hardship of such restrictions, we have no right to insist on the rescinding of the order which does not interfere with any rights secured to our subjects by treaty. « 10 . A copy of this letter will be sent to Colonel Felly direct.” 32. The above letter closed the series of papers despatched in No. 4, 18th January 1870, to the Secretary of State. Paragraph 3 of this despatch concluded— “ Svud Azan has now been successful in his expedition (against the Beni-boo-Ah tribe) ; but we have deferred any formal recognition of his Government, until we are in possession of a more detailed and satisfactory report upon the state of affairs at Muscat, which we expect shortly to receive from Colonel Felly.” 33 . Colonel Disbrowe (No. 688 , 6 th November 1869) reported that an attack against Zanzibar was being plotted at Muscat; and again in his Nos. 708 and 712, of the 11th December, on the same subject and of the . forcible clipping of mustaches in Muscat by Arab sepoys acting conjointly with Muthowas. 34. The Bombay Government were requested (No. 96P., 13th January 1870) to ascertain from Colonel Felly what foundation there was for these statements. * No. 6 of 1870, dated 25th Jan. The Secretary of State was apprized* of the rumour. 35. Colonel Disbrowe (No. 733, 25th December 1869) submitted his latest intelligence:— “ A dissension has actually occurred amongst the members of the Muscat Government. Khulelee has left Muscat with his family and proceeds, as I am told, to Somaeel, being on bad terms with both Azan and Sheikh Salih.f Ibrahim's feelings, f “ I am not satisfied on this point ag j understand, are better towards Khulelee than Azan's. Syud *' a ' Azan continues sick ; some say very sick. “ Muscat is quiet, but I dare not predict regarding the future. “ I hear Sheikh Salih threatens to make a descent upon Gwadur after the Eed; probable port of departure from Muscat shores would, according to rumour, be Birka. Colonel Pelly was asked to report. 36. The Secretary of State was informed in No. 9 of 1870, dated February 1st. 37. Syud Azan had returned to Muscat on December 14th under a salute. 38. The despatch No. 17, of 22 nd February 1870, to the Secretary of State, recurred to the matter of Syud Azan’s recognition :— “ Although we were of opinion that the mere fact of threatened hostilities with the Wahabees ought not to deter us from recognizing Azan, if we were satisfied that his authority r / /( 11 ) was secure against internal revolution, yet now that hostilities have actually broken out, the effect of which upon the allegiance of* the people of Muscat to Azan b'in Gheis it is impossible to foresee, we deem it desirable, for the present at least, to postpone any decisive steps. We are of opinion, however, that should he succeed in adjusting his differences with the Wahabees and still retain his power in Muscat, we should proceed formally to recognise him.” 39 . On 14th March 1870 (in No. 108 from Bombay, 21st March) Colonel Felly wrote of “ the arrival at Muscat of a French Gun-boat (Le Bruul) whose Commander recognized the Muscat Government. “ It will be in the recollection of Government that a few weeks ago a Dutch corvette similarly visited Muscat and saluted the Muscat white dag. “As I hope to arrive on the Arab Coast a few days hence, I postpone any further remarks.” 40. From Colonel Felly’s letters of 29th March and 8 th April in Nos. 134 and 147, from Bombay Government, it seemed that there was more probabi lity than ever of Syud Azan being firmly seated in power, lie wrote:— “ As regards the Chiefs of the Littoral, it appears that, when Syud Azan took Beraymee, he entered into alliance with the Aboothabee Chief, and paying him a portion of the tribute, which previous Sultans of Muscat had paid to the Wahabee Ameer, secured the aid of the Aboothabee Chief in the protection of the Beraymee frontier. « Syud Azan, thus strengthened by Aboothabee, next proceeded to threaten the remaining Chiefs* of the Littoral. These in turn (as above stated) * Chiefs of Debay, Shargah, Ojman, entered into a defensive compact. Syud Azan hearing of this compact retrained from attack; but feeling apparently assured of Aboothabee’s ddelity, and of the Wahabee's complications, confided Beraymee to the charge of a relative, and himself returned to Muscat. “ Meantime, the compact of the Littoral Chiefs was scarcely entered into when one of the subscribing parties, viz., the Chief of Shargah, turned traitor in favor of Azan. Thereupon, the remaining subscribers to the compact compassed the peaceable expulsion of the Shargah Chief and replaced him by his relative, Ibrahim, who is at this moment visiting me as Chief of ^hargah. “ The question arises, in what way do all the circumstances above sketched, and which are purely of the nature of a contest by land, affect our interests or notice ? “ The direct answer is, that these circumstances affect our relations with the Muscat State, ' the stability or otherwise of Azan’s power, and more immediately the question whether we should or should not recognize Syud Azan.” 41. lie also remarked :— “ It is probable that the Muscat authorities would prize our recognition principally on the following accounts :— “ \stly .—By being recognised by us, the status of the Muscat Government -would be improved, both abroad and at home, while the public mind would cease to mis apprehend our relations with other aspirants to power; “ Inilly .—Recognition would probably be considered to imply restoration of Gwadur, and the other outlying Muscat territories in Mekran; also, perhaps, our good offices in respect to a release of the Bunder Abbass districts; and “ 'brdly .—A recognised Ruler of Muscat would probably infer that the arbitrament of the late Earl Canning would secure to him the Zanzibar subsidy ; and this is a question in which the vassal Chiefs of Oman are interested, for this subsidy is a source whence those Chiefs are benefited by the Muscat Ruler.” 42. The Bombay Government telegraphed on 20th April 1870:— “ Following message from Colonel Felly:—‘ I have received the following from Major Way :—2nd April. Symptoms of dissension between Sala and Khulelee; Sala declined to go south to collect troops, alleging he did all the work and Khulelee got the pay, and that reward promised and expenditure incurred for past assistance had not yet been received; Syud Azan, Ibrahim, and Sala go to Fuluj to-day. Khulelee remains here/ By later advice, 11th, Acting Political Agent reports that dissension has been made up, but a coolness remains.” (see despateh to Secretary of State, No. 31, of 27th May 1870, in the Chapter on Syud Toorkee’s return to power.) The subsequent history of Syud Azan is comprised in the Chapter on Syud Toorkee’s return to power.CHAPTER HE—(Sections 43—58.) WAHABEE ADVANCES ON BERAYMEE. 43 . On 29th January 1870 the Bombay Government telegraphed “The Gulf mail just in leaves little room for doubting- that the Wahabees are actually on the march for Beraymee. It seems also that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at 100, to co-operate with land force. We have only Clyde in the Gulf and Dalhomie at Muscat. I shall send Colonel Pelly back in the Dryad, if possible, as soon as she can be got ready. 44 . The Foreign Secretary wrote a summary of the question and his opinion, dated February 6 th, 1870: “ From the Bombay Selections regarding the Persian Gulf, it appears (117) that the Fort of Beravmee was built by the Wahabee General Syud bin Mootluk, and was held by the Wahabees till the decline of their power, when it was taken possession of by the Naeem tribe, who inhabit the surrounding country. It is really the key m Oman. “ In 1845, when the Wahabee forces were marching to demand tribute from Muscat, the Fort of Beraymee again fell into the hands of Syud bin Mootluk, and the Chiefs of the Naeem and other neighbouring tribes tendered their allegiance. The Beniyas Chief reduced the Fort of Beraymee and defeated the Wahabee troops in 1848, but the Wahabees recovered it m the following year and appear to have held it ever since till it was taken by Azan bin Gheis in June last. It was always considered as the Wahabee outpost towards Oman, and held by a Wahabee Governor, and in 1853 Syud Thoweynee, then Chief of Muscat, agreed to the perma nent occupation of Beraymee by the Wahabees. “ During the recent contest for power in Muscat, Sideyree, the Wahabee Lieutenant of Beravmee, was pledged to the side of Syud Salem. He was murdered, however, by the Chief of Shargah on 7th April last year. ‘On his death the Naeem tribe, according to Colonel Disbrowe,* who f complained bitterly of oppression suffered at * Proceedings, August 1869, No. 1/0. hands of Sideyree, the late Wahabee Lieutenant, resolved in their minds how they could free themselves from the AVahabee yoke, and resorted to the expedient of inviting 'Azan to take possession of Beraymee. Azan and Khulelee not being the men to allow the grass to grow under their feet, the offer of the Naeem was accepted.’ The proceedings of Azan were most probably hastened by a peremptory demand made on him by the Wahabees for payment of tribute. At any rate, the result was that Azan marched on Beraymee with about 1,500 men, and took it on the 18th of June after a very slight resistance. “ On 2nd August Colonel Disbrowe wrote :—‘ So far as I can see and judge, Beraymee was gratuitously and unjustly invaded by Syud Azan, and Azan must look for Wahabee retaliation/ “ From the telegram received from Bombay it appears that the Wahabees are now really marching to recover Beraymee, and that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at 100, to co-operate with their land forces. The question is whether this is, or is not, a breach of the maritime peace which will justify our interfering to prohibit the co-operation by sea. “ Now, in the first place, it is to be remarked that although in 1800 the Wahabee Ameer gave us a written declaration that he would not ‘ injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially the kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zukat (tribute) that has been customary of old/ yet this agreement can, of course, give us no ground for remonstrating against any attack provoked by the hostilities on the part of Muscat. The engagement is therefore wholely inapplicable to the present case. “ In the next place it is to be noted that neither the Ameer of Riad nor the Sultan of Muscat is a party to the maritime peace. We have, however, of our own authority declared our determination to prevent, by force of arms if necessary, any party at Muscat or elsewhere from undertaking warlike operations by sea; but we have also declared that these orders will not prevent the Muscat Government from sending munitions of war from one port in Muscat territory along the unbroken Muscat Coast line to another Muscat port, provided the vessels remain constructively within Muscat territory by never going beyond gun-shot distance from the beach. “Now the case of Wahabee boats co-operating for the reduction of Beraymee seems very different from that of Muscat above referred to. It is not stated in the telegram where the boats are to sail from, where they will probably land, and by whom they are manned. I have been unable to ascertain precisely how far the Wahabee Coast line extends. In the map attached to his memorandum on the Wahabees, Wheeler only brings it to the west of the promontory of Katar, quite 350 miles to the west of Beraymee. At any rate whether this intervening coast line is actual Wahabee territory or only subject to \\ ahabee influence, it isinhabited by the Beniyas^ Joasmi and other tribes, upon whom the terms of the maritime peace are binding’. Beraymee is good 50 miles from the sea-coast, and cannot be reached from the sea except by landing on a part of the coast occcupied by tribes subject to the perpetual agreement of peace. W e should be justified in calling upon these tribes to prevent their coast line from being made such use of; and, therefore, we should equally be justified in remonstrating with the Ameer of Iliad from making such use of it and in preventing him from doing so, even though he is no direct party to the maritime peace. “ There is also, I think, a great difference between the transport of munitions of war along the Coast for the purpose of storing and garrisoning a fort, and the transport of such munitions with the avowed purpose of attacking or recovering a fort. The one is a precautionary measure which may really be in the interests of peace and the prevention of hostilities, the other is directly aggressive and provocative of hostilities. “ I think, therefore, we should be quite justified in calling on the Ameer to abstain from sending a force against Beraymee by sea even if it never go beyond gun-shot from the shore. If our ships of war were in the Gulf, probably the mere expression of our wish would be suffi cient. It is unfortunate that they have all left the Gulf except the Clyde. The Dalhousie is at Muscat. Ihe Dryad, the Nymph, and Daphne are all in Bombay Harbour. On 23rd De cember instructions were sent to Colonel Felly to return to Muscat. He does not seem vet to have left Bombay. He might now be directed to return to the Gulf with the Nymph 'ox the Daphne, or both, taking Muscat on the way.” * Tei. No. 230 p., 7 th Feb. 1870. 45. The Bombay Government was asked *— “ Have y° u information to show where Wahabee boats are likely to start from, and where likely to land ? Is coast line and country .between Kateef and Aboo Debar allied with °r feudatory .of, Ameer of Riad, or are tribes inhabiting it quite independent. Can you quote any precedent for our interference in Persian Gulf between two States who are not parties to maritime truce ?” 1 I X $6) l\iis. iVa^inswered an the^lOik FeWary :— “ The Wahabee boats are likely to start, some from Kateef, which is a Wahabee port, and others from the Guttur (’oast, and to land at some point between Aboothabee and Shargah The chief port of the Guttur Coast is Wukra, belonging to the Chief, Mahomed bin Saleh who may be said to be independent, though he pays an annual sum to Bahrein, a portion of _ which goes to the Wahabee Ameer. . U Shargah belongs to the Joasmee tribe who, as regards religious tenets, approach nearly to the VV ahabees, though politically they are independent. 4 he Beniyas tiibe inhabiting the coast line adjacent to Aboothabee would not appear to be allied or feudatory to the Wahabees. The Chief of Aboothabee, who is at the head of the Beniyas, has always been closely allied in interest to the Syud Saeed branch of Muscat. The Beniyas tribe are stronger on land than the Joasmees, and, therefore, exercise considerable influ ence over the surrounding Bedouin tribes, but the Joasmees are more powerful at sea. “ The British Government has always been adverse to the extension of Wahabee influence in Oman. No precedent can be quoted of actual interference between the Muscat and Waha bee powers by our Government, but it has always lent a moral support to Muscat in the differ- en.ces of that State with the Wahabees by sending vessels of war to the Arab Coast when hos tilities threatened, and m one instance (in 18G5-0C when the late Syud Thowevnee undertook to resist the W ahabee Ameer) guns and material of war were supplied to the Sultan bv our (xovernment. ^ “The latter policy of the Indian Government has been, however, to forbid operations by sea in the Persian Gulf or Gulf of Oman to any power whatsoever. “ In June 1868 the late Viceroy directed the prevention by force of any operation by Muscat against Persia, and, of course, would similarly have resisted any operation by Persia against Muscat. Similarly the Zanzibar Sultan has been told that operations bv sea* against Muscat would not be permitted, and the Government at Muscat has been prevented attenfpting to regain Gwadur and Charbar. Ihe maritime truce affects only the smaller Chiefs on the Littoral; neither Muscat, Persia, nor the Ameer of Riad are parties to it.” w 47. The following on the 7th February came from Bombay : €/ “ Following telegram received ‘ Wahabee force approaching Muscat. Tribes in Jaalan south waul are generally ho ding back. Appears at present doubtful if Azan can raise any suffi cient opposing force. Telegram ends. My instructions of February 3rd were, to observe strict neutrality between contending parties, and to interfere with no' operations by land as IZZ Sent to ./!; otect . Bntlsh su bjects and property, and to maintain maritime truce by force it necessary; if thought necessary to alter these instructions, it will be best to do so at reported te b°e Sd/on WedfjuV^ * ^ “ 130 “““ b ^ 0 “&gt;and money vouring to These instructions to Captain Douglas were approved. d 8 Major Wav, writing from Muscat on January 21 st, reported that men rr W ere being collected but slowly by Azan bin Gheis, who was endea- recruit in Burka. His firm adherents, Ibrahim bin Gheis and Sheikh Salih, were at the same place, but their success was no better than their C ne s. A rumour had reached him, lor which he could not \ ouch, that the Buii-boo- Ali, against whom the Imaum was lately victorious in Jaalan, had again rebelled, had rescued some men of their tribe who had been taken prisoners and had refused to co-operate with the Imaum against the M ahabees. A translation ot a letter is also sent, in which the Ameer of Nejd communicated to Syud Salem, the Ex-Imaum, his advance against Oman, and promised to reinstate him. From the date of this letter, which must have travelled, it authentic, from the Ameer’s camp through Kishm to Muscat in three days. Colonel Felly was inclined to doubt the fact of its having emanated from the Wahabee Ameer, and inclined to the belief that it was the handiwork ol k\ iid Salem or of Hajec Ahmed. Major Way could not state the position ol tie Wahabee Army at the time that he wrote, all he knew being that it had le t Lahsa. Colonel Felly, writing at Bombay on the 31st of January, on the strength of information received from Gwadur and Bushire, represented it as being at Guttur, and Sheikh Saleh as being in Jaalan. Azan bin Gheis, he added, was endeavoring to obtain the support ol the Chief ol Abootha ice. This Chief was, unlike the rulers of Nejd and Oman, a signatar\ of the man- time truce. His principal port was well-situated for the landing of tioops intended to operate against Beraymee, and preparations were on loot at Ivatcet for an expedition by sea to co-operate with the land forces. Another report, to which Major Way was not able to attach full credence was that an amnesty had been granted to all ot the Naeem tribe who might return to their allegiance to the M ahabees. This was the tribe lor v hose protection against Wahabee aggression Azan bin Gheis took up arms last } eai and stormed Beraymee. Khulelee by the latest account was at Muscat. * No. 55, 14th February 1870. 49. The Bombay Government forwarded* fur ther Muscat news in detail:— “ According to Sheikh Naseer, the Wahabee force, variously computed at two to live thousand men, and again at ten thousand men, was within five days of Beraymee. Azan bin Gheis had met with no support from the fighting tribes of the south. He had with him certainly not more than two thousand men. Some were inclined to put the strength of his followers so low as six hundred. The Chiefs from Has el Khyma to Debaye were not hostile to the Wahabee Ameer; the Chief of Aboothabee,though suspected of playing a double game, was likely to remain neutral. It was expected that the invaders would experience no cheek at Beraymee. In such case their next move would be in all probability to Sohar, and thence a passage by sea to Muscat might be attempted. To prevent such an attempt, Major \t ay urged on the Bombay Government the necessity of letting him retain the Dalhousie, which the latter had telegraphed for, if her presence was not absolutely required at Muscat. I he Ameer had ordered at Guttur a hundred vessels from his own coast for the embarkation of his troops. Syud Salem had expressed his intention of joining the M ahabees, but had not by the latest account left Kishm.” 50. This information wns sent to the Secretary of State in No. 17 of 1870, 22nd February. Inter alia, it briefly recapitulated the events:— “ The advance of the Wahabee Ameer upon Beraymee, as reported in the enclosures of this despatch, has somewhat altered the complexion of affairs. According to the latest report which w r e have received from Muscat, dated February 4th, the Ameer of Iliad had left Lahsa with a force probably not less than two thousand, or more than five thousand men, and was within five days’ march of Beraymee. He had granted an amnesty to all the Naeem tribe of Beraymee who may return to their allegiance to the Wahabees, and had declared his inten tion of marching on the town of Muscat itself after reducing Beraymee. At the latter place it was anticipated that he would meet no check. The Chiefs from Ras el Khyma to Debaye had shown no signs of hostility to the Wahabces. Syud Salem had expressed his intention of joining the Ameer’s army, but by the latest account had not left Kishm. On the other hand, it is reported that Azan bin Gheis has not been successful in collecting men and money,IV ( 15 ) and that the Chief of Aboothabee, on whose support he had counted, was likely to remain neutral. It is also rumoured that the Beni-boo Ali, against whom Azan was lately victorious in Jaalan, have rebelled and refused to co-operate with him against the Wahabees.” 51. Colonel Felly, then at Government House, Calcutta, on the receipt of telegram from Muscat, reported (22nd February 1870) :— “ On the whole, the Muscat Wahabee quarrel seems tc be approaching its solution. And I would respectfully suggest that I return to the Gulf with all convenient speed, and with des- cretionary power to recognise Azan or otherwise, according as circumstances may seem to require; any recognition should be in writing, and should explicitly declare all questions of detail, Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory, to be reserved for subsequent discussion. “ Meantime, I would propose addressing the subjoined telegrams to Major Smith and the Assistant Resident at Bushire. “ To Major Smith, Angaum : f Proceed with Kwanrjtunrj to Bahrein and rendezvous Clyde. I doubt the Ameer molesting. If he do, prevent any boats arriving touching the island. If absolutely necessary, address a letter by direction to Ameer informing him that I am instructed to maintain the maritime peace, and am embarking for the Arab coast. If all seem quiet at Bahrein, leave Clyde there and proceed in Kwaugtung along Arab coast, warning all parties gainst breach of truce, and informing them of my approach. From Arab coast return to Angaum and report, and look out for mail steamer/ ” 52. These instructions were approved, and Colonel Felly was requested to proceed to the Persian Gulf with all convenient speed, and invested with dis cretionary power to recognize Azan bin Gheis or otherwise as circumstances might seem to require, but with the explicit reservation of all questions of detail, Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory, as suggested, and provided that the advantage of Azan’s recognition were not neutralized by this reservation. (Reported to Secretary of State in No. 19, 15th March 1870.) 53. On 5th March Major Way telegraphed :— “ Muscat quiet. Syud Azan writes,' 1st March, from Beraymee, f Sheikh Zaeed of Aboo thabee has arrived and sworn friendship and promised to opjwse Wahabees. Mahomed Ali Naeem sworn allegiance and promised Littoral Chiefs should visit me'at Sohar. Sha’nt visit coast, but shall return to Sohar when arrangements finished for protection of Beraymee. Wa habees appear to be still at Guttur. Not believed here that Wahabees can now come by land, and half of war tax has been returned. Cai/t say at this distance if attempt will be made by sea. Amulgavine Chiefs cousin and Wahabee emissaries arrived at Kishm, and Syud Salem left for Amulgavine with them on 23rd.” 54. On 21st March Colonel Felly wrote :— . “ All accounts concur in stating that the Wahabee Ameer is still at his own fort of Ojair as already submitted. His Highness probably hesitates to leave the Aboothabee Chief in his rear, and his advance is, no doubt, rendered more difficult through the want of rain and consequent poverty of drinking water along the line of march. “ The alliance between the Aboothabee Chief and Syud Azan, and the fact of the latter's return to Muscat, tend to show that Azan's position is increasingly strong.” 55. On 2 nd April 1870 Colonel Felly telegraphed :— “Wahabee Ameer still in his own territories. Doubt if he will attempt Beraymee this year. Bahrein proceedings have had good effect. All quiet down to date. Clyde still at Bahrein watching Wahabees.” 56. Colonel Felly reported on 8 th April (in No. 147 from Bombay Go vernment, 25th April 1870):— “ The Wahabees. It appears that some months ago the Wahabee Ameer collected his forces in the neighbourhood of Lahsa with intent to attack Beraymee. He communicated with the Chiefs of the Littoral as per margin, in view to their co-operation or neutrality, and these Chiefs, with the exception of Aboothabee, returned conciliatory answers, but the Wahabee Ameer was deterred from further movement by the following considerations:— “ \st. —That rain not having fallen, water and grass were not available for his horses and men along the line of march; “ Zndly .—That the combination of the Aboothabee Chief with the Muscat Sultan rendered the march more hazardous; c ■\rdly. Unit the Ameer, conscious of having harboured one of the Bahrein pirates and of having received the Bahrein plunder in his territories, feared that, sooner or later, we should demand satisfaction from him at his ports—Ojair and Kateef; and “ Uhly .—In a minor degree, the Ameer was suspicious of intrigue on the part of his rela tives at his capital, Riadh.% m ( 16 ) “ Influenced by the above considerations, the Wahabee Ameer refrained from marching, .and the season is now so advanced that it is doubtful if he will attempt anything this year. The most recent report is to the effect that he is already returning towards his capital. (See despatch to Secretary of State, No. 31, ol 27th May 18/0, in the Chapter on Syud Toorkee’s return.) 57. On 7th May 1870 Colonel Felly continued Several communications I have recently received concur in stating that the Ameer him self has returned to his capital, and that Nasir-bin-Mobarek, the pixate Chief, who escaped fiom Bahrein, has sustained a defeat at the hands of certain of the inland Wahabee tribes. Some of the reports allege that Nasir-bin-Mobarek himself was killed in the fight, while other reports are to the effect that he fled, and that nothing certain had since been heard of him.” « p s Since writing the above I have received a letter from the Bahrein Chief, in which he states that Nasir-bin-Mobarek was killed. It appears further that the defeat of his tribe (the Howajir) was complete.” 58. On 8 tli January 1871 Colonel Felly telegraphed “ Reports of Saood's victory, capture of leader of Wahabee Ameer's forces, and death of Wahabee Ameer, Abdoolla, confirmed. Saood's success beneficial to interests of Bahrein and coast line.” CHAPTER IV.— (Sections 59—67.) MARITIME PEACE IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND SEA OF OMAN. 59. In connection with the W T ahahee advances on Bareymee arose the question of the preservation of the maritime truce. 60. On receipt of the telegraph of the 29th January 1870 from Bombay, which tvas as follows:— “ The Gulf mail just in leaves little room for doubting that the Wahabees are actually on the march for Beraymee. It seems also that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at one- hundred, to co-operate with land force. We have only Clyde in the Gulf and Dalhousie at Muscat. I shall send Colonel Pelly back in the Dryad, if possible, as soon as she can be got ready.” the Foreign Secretary asked of Bombay Government— “ Have you any information to shew where Wahabee boats are likely to start from, and where likely to land ? Is coast line and country between Kateef and Aboo Debay allied with, or feudatory of, Ameer of Riadh, or are tribes inhabiting it quite independent ? Can you quote any precedent for our interference in Persian Gulf between two States who are not parties to maritime truce ?” 61. Commodore Heath also wrote on the 9th February 1870 :— “ His Excellency the Governor of Bombay has recently requested that a Man-of-War may be sent to Muscat, with instructions to protect British interests and to prevent by force any infringement of the f maritime truce.' “ I beg to submit, for Your Excellency's consideration, the necessity of defining, for the guidance of Naval Officers who may now or in future be employed in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, the precise meaning of the term maritime truce and the geographical limits within which it is to be maintained. “ There is at present much uncertainty upon the subject, and I have been informed that whilst some of the Political Officers in the Persian Gulf consider that any carrying of warlike stores by sea for any purpose whatever would be an infringement of the truce, there are others who would allow of such transport, provided the vessels remained during their voyage within a distance of three miles from the beach. “ The original instructions from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, under which I act, imply that the ‘maritime truce' is confined to the Persian Gulf, and the draft instructions recently approved by His Grace the Duke of Argyll bear the same interpretation, whereas during the recent disturbances at Muscat, the Sultan has been held to be bound by that truce with respect to Muscat and Gwadur, both places being outside the Persian Gulf.”62. The Viceroy’s opinion was:— “ It is very difficult to decide without knowing whether the Ameer of Riadh really has possessions on the sea-coast at all or not, or whether Kateef is merely an allied or a feudatory State. “ The telegram does not say where the expedition has been organised. If it is to proceed from near Kateef to any part of the coast opposite Beraymee, it can hardly do so without going out of sight of land and getting across the deep indents and bays. “ Politically speaking, our interest cannot be improved by the Wahabee Ameer establishing a paramount influence upon the coast of the Gulf or in Oman. “ The information at our disposal is so very scant that it is a difficult matter to decide whether this expedition of boats ought to be stopped by force or not.” 63. The Foreign Secretary’s note reviewed the history of the question :— “ Our first general Treaty * with the Arab Chiefs on the southern shores of the Persian * Treaties, VII., 240. Gfulf was concluded in 1820. The object of it was to put down plunder and piracy, but no attempt was then made to interfere with acknowledged wars between the tribes. An acknowledged war was defined in the Treaty to be a war f proclaimed, avowed and ordered by Government against Government/ Under the cloak of acknowledged war, however, piracies were regularly committed, more particularly during the season of the pearl fishery. The Chiefs were, therefore, induced, in 1835, to bind themselves not to engage in hostilities by sea for a period of six months, on the understanding that the British Government would not interfere in their wars by land. The results of this agreement were so good that the Chiefs were easily persuaded to renew it the following year for eight months. Thereafter, it was renewed annually till 1843 when it was t Treaties, VII., 258. prolonged for ten years, f and, finally, in 1853 was made perpetual.f This Treaty provides that there shall be a X Ditto 2o9. complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the subscribing parties; that in the event of aggressions being committed at sea by one subscriber upon another, the injured tribe should not retaliate, but refer the matter to the British authorities in the Persian Gulf; and that the British Government should watch over the s t. f • vit 9 peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the due observance of the Treaty. In 18G1 the Chief of Bahrein became bound§ by similar engagements. “ The Chiefs who are bound by these engagements are— / “ 1. The Joasmee Chief of Ras el Khyma or Shargah. The Beniyas Chief of Aboothabee. The Boo Filasa, Chief of Debaye. The Chief of Amalgavine. “ 5. The Chief of Ejman. “ 6 . The Chief of Bahrein. “ But though these are the only Chiefs who have subscribed the engagements, we have as guardians of the peace of the Gulf, in practice extended the terms of the Treaty to all acts of aggression by sea. “Thus, in the instructions of 11 th December 1868 to the Bombay Government, we consi dered ourselves f justified, by our supremacy and position in regard to affairs in the Persian Gulf/ in preventing both Syud Salem and Syud Toorkee from making an attack on Muscat by sea, although Muscat is no party to the Treaty of Peace. On the 9th January 1869, also, we told tlje Bombay Government by telegraph that f all naval operations by any' party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of arms, if necessary/ These instructions were again repeated by telegraph on 23rd and by letter on 28th January, and again on 10th February. “ In the same way, when the Sultan of Zanzibar wished to fit out an expedition against Muscat by sea, his Envoys were told by the Government of Bombay that no exception could be admitted to the orders of Government for the preservation of the peace at sea. “In regard to the orders about Muscat, however, we have declared|| that, while they would Colonel Polly, to Political Agent, ?PP'y to . a Y eSSe ' P“ ttin S &lt;&gt; ut Muscat port to the Outly- '■ - ing territories ot Muscat, such as those on the Mekran coast, they would not apply to vessels going with munitions of war from one port of Muscat territory to another, provided ( 1 ) both places lay on the unbroken coast line, and ( 2 ) the boats never left what is constructively Muscat territory, i.e., gun-shot distance from the beach. “ Further, when Bunder Abbas was recently captured by Sheikh Saeed from Hajee Mimed, the latter begged that Sheikh Saeed might be called to account, because he had come by ‘ and we thought the matter of sufficient importance to make enquiry about it. l/“ 2. i^3. “4. Muscat, No. 252, of 27tli May 1869, approved in letters to Government, Bombay, No. 1076, dated 4th August, and No. 1177, dated 23rd August 1869. sea E( 18 ) “ We have no copy of the instructions referred to in Commodore Heath’s letter. But the interpretation of the maritime peace therein given, if correctly described, is, in our opinion, too narrow. We ourselves should prefer to define the sphere of our protectorate to be the entire Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman as embraced within a line drawn from the southern course of Muscat territory to Gwadur or the Mekran Coast; and the object to be the pievention of a 1 hostile operations by sea within these limits, except the transport within three miles of the coast, of munitions of war from one part of the territory of any Chief to anothei on t ic unbroken coast line.” 64. The Hon’ble Mr. Stephen’s legal opinion was as follows “ I am inclined to agree with Mr. Aitchison as to the definition which he suggests of “ the sphere of our protectorate,” to use his own language, but we must face the fact that to issue with a definition for the instruction of Naval Officers is a mere act of Sovereign power, and that it is altogether distinct from the maritime truce established by the Treaty of 1853, which can apply only to the Chiefs who signed it and their successors. 1 think that our conduct with regard to Muscat and Zanzibar, referred to in the note, is to be explained and defended on the broad ground, that it is our right and duty not merely to punish, but also to prevent piracy, and that the most, and indeed the only, effectual mode of doing so is by preventing maritime raids which practically are sure to degenerate into piracy. I should lay down this principle broadly and take the responsibility, when necessary, of acting upon it, and 1 think the limits proposed by the Secretary for its application judicious. “ I do not think, however, that it is in our power (except in a case of special emergency) to give wider instructions to Naval Officers than those which they have already received from the Government at home.” 65. The order in Council, 16th March 1870, was— “To lie over till Azan is recognised. Whole question then to be reviewed for submission to the Secretary of State/’ 66 . The Secretary of State was informed in despatch No. 32, of 27th May 1870 “ In forwarding, for Your Grace’s consideration, a copy of a letter from Sir Leopold Heath, dated 9 th February, we take the opportunity of inviting the attention of Her Majesty’s Govern ment to our position in regard to the coasts of Mekran, Oman, Arabia, Somalee, Zanzibar, &amp;c. “ Of late years we have been gradually assuming a position \yith regard to the maritime affairs of this enormous line of coast somewhat similar to that which we are by Treaty engage ment bound to maintain within the Persian Gulf. “ It is for Her Majesty’s Government to consider how far that interference which has partly been necessitated by our efforts to suppress the Slave Trade, partly by our occupation of Aden, and partly by our relations with Muscat, is to continue and be maintained. “ We are disposed to think that it would be almost impossible to recede altogether from the position which we have assumed, and to limit our interference to the Persian Gulf only; but, at the same time, there is (as in the cases reported in our N°. 259, datol oth Augiisi isoa despatches noted in the margin) some risk lest our friendly No. 380, dated 7th December 1869. relations with turkey, Lgypt, and the smaller States on these coasts may be endangered. “ We invite attention to the subject, because it is possible that Her Majesty’s Government may not be fully aware of the extent to which we are committed to the preservation of the maritime peace on a line of coast extending from Kurrachee to the morthern limits of the Mozambique Channel.” 67. The question arose again after the affair of the Quantung (see Chapter on Quantung affair). CHAPTER V.— (Sections 68—71.) THE “ BULLFINCH” AFFAIR. 68 . On 19th March 1870 Major Way at Muscat telegraphed to Colonel Felly:— “ Bullfinch's boat fired on from Julalee. Explanation demanded. Shame and reo-ret expressed by Khulelee. Governor of fort imprisoned, and garrison dismissed. Khulelee informed that matter must be referred to Government. Azan returned and force dismissed and says Wahabees are at Hissa and will not come ; and trusts in Aboothabee’s assistance; and Syud Toorkee on mail; and all quiet at present.”) . 1 ( 19 ) ^ Colonel Felly wrote (in No. 110 , 22 nd March 1870, from Bombay) that Major Way appeared to have proceeded with all care in the matter. 69. On 31st March 1870 the Bombay Government telegraphed :— “Colonel Felly telegraphs from Jask to-day:—'Acting Political Agent reports that firing on liulljltick’s boat was without knowledge or consent of authorities. Commander of Bullfinch reports that, in his opinion, insult to flag was not intended, but that fort was carrying out rules of the port relative to all boats having lights after dusk. In above opinion 1 concur. Syud Azan, as head of de facto Government, has sent me written apology with State Seal appended. Governor of fort already imprisoned and garrison removed. Acting Political Agent considers Muscat territory is quiet, and Azan strong and confident; but that he is much annoyed at return of Syud Toorkee under British flag. Trade reviving, and Major Way satis fied with general conduct of authorities. I respectfully solicit instructions as to whether Govern ment deem present arrangement of firing difficulty satisfactory, and as to whether there are any fresh instructions regarding recognition or otherwise. Syud Toorkee said to be at Bunder Abbas, and W ahabees still in their own country. Bullfinch will await reply at Jask station/ ” 70. The matter was reported at length in Colonel Felly’s No. 44 , of 29th March 1870 (in No. 131, Bombay, 13th April) Having yesterday arrived at Muscat I communicated with Major Way, the Actino- Poli tical Agent, and with Captain Lodder, the Officer Commanding Bullfinch, and learned from them that they considered that no insult had been intended to our flag. Captain Lodder read to me an extract from a report which he had already addressed to the Commodore in these terms; and he further favored me with a letter, copy of which is appended, and in which he writes as follows :— • u. 1 ^ * n ^? lrn y ou ^ anl opinion that it (the firing) was not intended as an insult to the flag, but carrying out the rules of the port relative to all boats having lights after &lt; ark. 1 also believe that the people in the fort were not aware at the time that it was a boat belonging to this ship. “ The Acting Political Agent reports as follows :— No. 175, of 16th March 1870. ‘from Sheikh Naseris manners that the firing on the Copy appended with appendices. boat was not only not with the knowledge or consent of the authorities, but contrary to their orders and wishes. “ After I had received these communications, Sheikh Naser, the Agent of the Muscat de Translate and copy appended. facto Government, called on me, and renewed to me the expla- ' nations and expressions of regret already tendered to the Acting Political Agent. He also brought to me from Syud Azan, the de facto head of the State, a letter of apology with the State Seal attached. The Governor of the fort had already been imprisoned and the garrison removed. I icplied briefly to Syud Azan s letter expressing my extreme regret at the occurrence, adding that I was glad to receive his apology, and that I would telegram proceedings to Govern ment. At the same time 1 verbally impressed on Sheikh Naser, in a decided manner, the graveness of the complications which might arise out of such accidents. “ M y own . impression is, that the firing had taken place without the knowledge of the Muscat authorities, and that no insult was intended. It appears that a rule had some’consider able time ago been established and notified to the effect that between gun-fire and sunrise all boats passing to and fro in the harbour should carry lights. But the rule does not appear to “ av ® specified whether by gun-fire was to be understood sunset, or the eight o’clock evening gun. And the time when the Bullfinch's boat was passing was intermediate between sunset and eight o clock. The Acting Political .Agent is now specifying that it is to be understood that b&lt;Tats should carry lights between sunset and sunrise. “Bullfinch is now proceeding to the Jask Station with a telegram on this subject, copy of which I beg to append. “ I respectfully trust that the above arrangement of the firing difficulty may be deemed satisfactory by His Excellency in Council.” 71. (See despatch to Secretary of State, No. 31, of 27th May 1870, in the chapter on Syud Toorkee’s return.) C II A P T E R VI.— (Sections 72—159B.) RETURN OF SYUD TOORKEE TO POWER. 72^ In their telegram ot 31st March 1870 the Bombay Government said:— “ S y ud Toorkee said to be at Bunder Abbass, and \Vahabees still in their own country.”( 20 ) In reply to Government of India, they said that— « Svud Toorkee received no express permission from Bombay Government to return to the Persian Gulf, and that he obtained passage in regular mad steamer of the 7 th March. 73. On the 6 th April the Government of India called on the Bombay Government again to the same effect, and asked what were the circumstances ol his departure—they repeated their former answer. 74. Colonel Belly visited Bunder Ahhass, and on 2nd April telegraphed that Syud Toorkee had gone to the Arab Coast, hut his success was improbable. 75. On 10th April, Colonel Belly again— « Syud Toorkee writes from Behave earnestly begging a loan of money. He states that Wababee Ameer has written to him refusing to move at present, but Syud foorkee thinks he has hopes from Littoral Chiefs, not, however, from Aboothabee. By hist advices, all parts ot Guit of Persia and Oman are quiet, 1 respectfully solicit instructions as to Muscat recognition, and as to whether settlement of Bullfinch affair, proposed m my report of 29th March, is approved. The Government of India answered :— “ Previous orders regarding recognition of Azan do not require modification, unless, in your opinion, Syud Toorkee’s appearance on Arab Coast has altered seriously the aspect of affairs.” 76. The Government of India (No. 858P., dated 26th May 1870) wrote to the Bombay Government:— “ The arrival of Syud Toorkee at Muscat in an English Mail Steamer has apparently given rise to the belief, on the part of the Muscat authorities, that he is supported by the British Government in the project, which he is supposed to entertain, of renewing civil war tor the purpose of establishing himself in supreme power. By the latest accounts, Syud loorkee seems to have little chance of gaining adherents to his cause. He has no means, and according to Syud Abdool Aziz, whom Colonel Pelly questioned on the subject, he may for want of resources shortly have to retire from his present position at Debaye. But, whatever his intentions may be it should be clearly intimated to the Muscat Government that the British Government has in no way countenanced his recent proceedings, and will not assist him in any attempt to over throw Azan bin Gheis. With respect to Syud Toorkee’s request for a, loan, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be instructed to inform him that the British Gavernment can neither help him with money, nor assist him in any way in his designs against the present Government of Muscat.” 77. The situation at Muscat was fully described, and -the questions arising therefrom were submitted in despatch to Secretary of State, No. 31, ot 27th May 1870 :— “ 2. When last we addressed Your Grace a collision between the Ameer of Nejd and Azan bin Gheis seemed imminent. The W ahabees were known to have reached Lahsa in con siderable force with the intention of endeavouring to recover Beraymee. War craft on a large scale was being held in readiness at the ports of Ojair and Kateef, and Azan bin Gheis was busily engaged in enlisting recruits in the districts of the Batinah. His position became greatly strengthened by the open adherence to his cause of the Sheikh of Aboothabee, one of the most powerful of the Chiefs of the Arab Littoral, ibis alliance, coupled with the want of water and forage along the line of march, and the fearjest his relatives might take advantage of a protracted absence from Riadh to intrigue against him, induced the W ahabee. Ameer to refrain from further advance, although assured of the neutrality of the Chiefs of Ejman, Debaye, Shargah, Amulgavine, and Ras el Khyma. By the latest accounts he has fallen back with his troops on his capital. Azan bin Gheis, having left the Chief of Aboothabee to watch his interests near Beraymee, and having dismissed his own troops and remitted a portion of the war tax, returned to Muscat, and has since been heard of in the southern province of Jaalan. It is not unlikely, as Colonel Pelly remarks, that the Wahabee Ameer may at some future day renew his attempt to retake Beraymee, and to compel the payment from Muscat of the tribute which has now been for some time withheld. But for the present all danger of war appears to be at an end. It would indeed be difficult for him to take the field for some months to come, as the support of those Chiefs who have not rejected his over tures could not be depended upon till the pearl fishery season is over. “ 3 . Towards the end of last March we were informed by telegram that the garrison of the Julalee Fort had fired on a boat belonging to Her Majesty’s Ship Bullfinch. Sufficient details w'ere not communicated to enable as to form an opinion on the case, and we therefore delayed the issue of orders till we were in possession of a detailed report from Colonel Pelly, who had previously been instructed to visit Muscat for the purpose of making himself generally *(t f &gt; ( 21 ) acquainted with the feeling’s of the people towards Azan bin Gheis. The firing has proved on enquiry, to have been provoked by an omission on the part of the crew to eomplv with a standing regulation of the local authorities that every boat moving in the harbour shall carry * (Sk.) a li £ ht between sunrise an(1 sunset * The act was neither authorized by, nor known to, the members of the Muscat Government. Ample apology has been made and the Governor of the fort has been imprisoned, and the garrison dismissed for their share in the alfair. The Commander of the Bullfinch is convinced that no insult was intended. Under these circumstances, we have accepted the explanation given by the Muscat Government as sa tisfactory, and have expressed our regret that so grave a complication should have been risked by the neglect of a British Officer to observe the ordinary rules of the harbour. “4. The result of the enquiries which Colonel Felly has been able to make durino- his recent visit to Muscat shows that trade is reviving, and that the authorities are conciliatory in their demeanour towards our Agent, and desirous of promoting British interests. The general opinion is, that Azan bin Gheis is more firmly established than any of his immediate predeces sors, and that his rule is acceptable to his subjects. According to Major Way, the Political Agent, he has made all the tribes own his authority, he is more tolerant than formerly in matters of religion, and the country is gradually settling down under his Government. For the present his rivals do not seem to have power of injuring him. Svud Salem whom he deposed, wanders from place to place along the Littoral without a party, and without’the means of raising one. Colonel Felly is not at all certain that Syud Toorkee, who lately of his own accord, left his asylum at Bombay for Bunder Abbas and went thence to Debaye will be able to enlist the support of those Chiefs of the Littoral who have declared against Azan bin Gheis. He has applied to us fora loan, which we have declined to grant. Abdool Aziz, who in January last made an ineffectual attempt on Gwadur, has since arrived at Bushire without resources of any kind. In conversation with Colonel Felly, he has frankly admitted his own failure and has declared his opinion that neither he, Syud Salem, nor Syud Toorkee, has at present any chance against Azan bin Gheis, who has visited every part of the Muscat territories as a eonqueroi, has refused to give tribute to the Ameer of Nejd, has enforced the payment of the revenue, has enlisted recruits, and has been acknowledged by the people as Imam—a title which they refused to Syud Saeed. Abdool Aziz was further of opinion that Azan bin Gheis fir from being in danger of an attack from Syud Majid, might easily make a successful invasion lit '“i 18 t ™ 6 t,iat tbere bave lately been open differences between Khulelee and Sheikh Saleh, both of whom are members of the Council of the Muscat State. But ill-feeling between these men has often existed before, and, so far as we can judge, their dissensions have not hitherto endangered the interests of their ruler. On the occasion of their last dispute Azan bin Gheis was able to effect an outward reconciliation, and immediately afterwards to leave the capital for his southern dominions. From this we gather that he himself had no fear or evil consequences to his administration from the quarrel. “ 5 - Ma i or Wa 7 has drawn ° ur attention to the recent presence of a Dutch corvette and a Enclosure to No. 108, from Bombay ^ T renc ‘ h , | un - boa t at Muscat—the former of which saluted the Government, dated 2lst March 1870. rviustm nag, whilst the latter would have paid a similar com- , + u- u v P.ent had it not been contrary to rule for her to salute with the small armament which she carries. He has represented that the opening of the Suez Canal wdl, in al probability, lead to frequent visits of the vessels of European powers, and has suggested that if we delay the recognition of Azan bin Gheis as the V* ficto Kuler of the Muscat territories, the Imam may be disposed to secure the interposition of'some other power. See enclosure to No. 134, from Bombay ^ olonel 18 ot 0 I mnon that the Muscat Government Government, dated 14th April 1870, would at the present time value the recognition of the British , , , , ., Government; but he believes that 'such recognition would piobably be considered to imply the restoration, through our good offices, of f Gwadur and the other outlying Muscat territories m Mekran/ a renewed lease of Bunder Abbass and its depen dencies, and the continued payment of the Zanzibar subsidy. * h. As reported in the enclosures of our Secret despatch No. 4 , of 18th January last we .ue ot opinion that the continuance of our Agent at Muscat in the exercise of Consular and 1 olitica! powers, the acceptance of apologies from Azan bin Gheis for the outrage committed b&gt; his subjects on the Clyde, and the assertion from time to time of the rights and privileges uhich aie secured to us by our treaties with Muscat, are of themselves a qualified recognition dlpS . A ‘ u ' d ' % circumstances stated in our recognize Aza explicit reserv: stances have notpermittjM Colonel Felly to avail himself of the discretiorgtoen 1 h\m tVmake an &lt; pen and explicit declaration of our recognition of Azan. In our opinion, however the time 18 approaching at which the recognition of Azan, if it is to be made at all, can be no longer delayed; and our recognition of his Government ought to be accompanied by some declaration of policy on our part, and an intimation whether we intend to maintain existing i eat ics and engagements with the Muscat State, or which of them we propose to abandoif and which to maintain. In our letter to the Bombay Government of 23rd Decembei 1869 F( 22 ) (see our despatch No. 4, of 18th January 1870) we have expressed our opinion that the treaties, in which 'the British Government is directly a contracting party with the Muscat State, must be held to be still in force, notwithstanding any changes in the internal constitution of the Muscat State, or in the person of the Ruler. On this important question, however, we have not yet been favored with Your Grace’s decision. We feel that the formal recognition of Azan’s Government might lead to embarrassment and difficulty, unless we are in full possession of the views of Her Majesty’s Government on this and the other subsidiary questions, which, as already observed, are certain to be raised as the immediate consequence of any formal act of recognition. We have therefore directed the Resident to return for the present to Bushire, and to await our further instructions before taking any overt action in the matter. “ 7. We have already on several occasions represented that, before formally recognizing Azan bin Gheis, it is essential that we should be placed in possession of Your Grace’s final decision regarding the Zanzibar subsidy. We have also explained fully the reasons which have led us to consider that the payment of the subsidy is still binding on Zanzibar, and the dis astrous consequences likely to result, not only to the reputation of our Government, but to the peace of the Persian Gulf and the prosperity of Oman, from any countenance given to the Sultan of Zanzibar in the evasion of the just demands of the Muscat State. We need there fore only now remark that, since the date of our last despatch on this subject, No. 17, of 22nd February 1870, nothing has occurred which, in any respect, induces us to modify our views. “ 13. Similarly in our instructions of 11th December 1868 to the Bombay Government, we considered ourselves justified in preventing both Syud Salem and Syud Toorkee from making an attack on Muscat by sea; and on the 9th January 1869 we informed the Bombay Government by telegraph that “ all naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of arms if necessary.” These instructions were again repeated by telegraph on 23rd, .and by letter on 28th January, and again on 10 th February, as reported to Your Grace in our despatch No. 61, of 24th February 1869. “ 14. In the same way when the Sultan of Zanzibar wished to fit out an expedition against Muscat by sea, his Envoys were told by the Government of Bombay that no exception could be admitted to the orders of Government for the preservation of the peace at sea. “ 15. If in recognizing Azan bin Gheis as the Ruler of Muscat we were authorized to intimate to him that the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy, so essential to the prosperity of his Government, will be continued, and that we intend to maintain the same relations with him as with former Rulers, we anticipate little or no difficulty, by the exercise of our legitimate influence in preserving t le peace in the Sea of Oman on which the prosperity of the neighbour ing countries so intimately depends. Without such an intimation our recognition would be of little or no value, and unless we are prepared to secure to him the subsidy, to which not only he, but every Chief in Oman and on the shores of the Persian Gulf, considers our guarantee and good name are pledged, we consider that we should not be justified in preventing him from endeavouring by force of arms to recover those rights, of which he considers himself to have been unjustly deprived. We need hardly remind Your Grace that it was with the express purpose of preventing such hostilities that Lord Canning intervened to mediate between Muscat and Zanzibar, that our mediation was offered when an armed expedition had actually started against Zanzibar, and that the promise of the payment of the subsidy by that State formed one of the principal conditions of peace. “ 16. We feel so forcibly the difficulties in which we shall be placed by a recognition of the de facto Government of Muscat without a definite intimation of the views of Her Majesty’s Government as to the policy to be adopted in future towards that State, that we earnestly solicit an early 'decision on. the various points which we have from time to time laid before Your Grace. “ These points are — “First.-—Whether the recognition of Azan bin Gheis is to be accompanied by a declar ation of our future policy towards Muscat, and an intimation of our intention to maintain all existing treaties and engagements with the Muscat State ; or, if Her Majesty’s Government are not prepared to maintain all former treaties and engage ments, it is necessary that we should know which of them it is proposed to abandon, and which to maintain ? “ Second .— Whether the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy is to be enforced ; and if not enforced, whether we are to inform the Ruler of Muscat that we should interfere to prevent a recurrence to that state of things which existed when Lord Canning intervened to mediate between Muscat and Zanzibar ; and in the event of hostilities being threatened, as they then were, whether we should send an armed force to prevent the Ruler of Muscat from enforcing that to which he doubtless considers he has an indefeasible right ? “ Third .— Whether we are to hold out any hopes to him that we shall endeavour, by our friendly offices with Persia, to obtain for him the restoration of the lea\e nf Bunder Abbas*? J ° r K *“ Fourth .— Whether we are to endeavour to mediate on the subject of Gwadur and Charbar and in what sense ; and in the event of our mediation proving unsuccessf ul, 'whether we are to abstain from interference if the Ruler of Muscat desires to resume the sovereignty of those places by force ? &lt;( Fifth .— Whether we are to endeavour to obtain from Azan bin Gheis such engage ments as will, at all events for the present, secure the peace of the Gulf of Oman ? “17. W efeel assured that the momentous considerations affecting- our national honour, the peace of the seas, and the prosperity of the Chiefs and States on the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, which we have brought under your notice in our present and recent despatches on this subject, will receive that serious attention at the hands of Her Majesty's Government which their importance demands. (The paras. 8 to 12 are cpioted in the Gwadur and Charbar precis.) 78. On the 7th May Colonel Pelly wrote :— * While on the other hand a note from “ In an unofficial communication which I have received the brother of Wahabee Ameer would from the Persian Governor of Bunder Ahbass, he considers, that Aboothabee apparently from hearsay, that Syud Toorkee's position is im- proving.* 79. On 31st May 1870 Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Bombay Government and Government of India:— “Native Agent reports from Arab coast, after interview with Aboothabee Chief, that Littoral ( hiefs and Chief at Beraymee have forsaken Syud Toorkee at instance of Aboothahee C hief, \\ ho is in friendship with Azan. Agent thinks, that under such circumstances Svud Toorkee would have no chance. Wahabee Ameer returned to his capital.' [This was forwarded to the Secretary of State.] 80. And again on 14th June :— “ Syud Toorkee writes he cannot trust the Arabs; that his stay at Debaye is useless and expensive; that had he known the Wahahees would not come to Oman, he would not then have left Bombay; and that he is purchasing boats preparatory to embarkation.' 81. Major Way, the Acting Political Resident, Muscat, reportedf to Colonel t No. 254 , dated loth May 1870 . ^ ( ^ ' that Azan bin Gheis, attended by his brother Ibrahim and Sheikh Sala, had left Muscat for Burka with the intention of storming the fort of Azun, near Rostack, his object being to prevent it from falling into the hands of some rival like Syud Toorkee, as the allegiance of the Ilearbah tribe who held it was not above suspicion, and the : No. 196, dated 9th June 1870 . 5 rt was stron £b though short of supplies. The Bombay Government forwardedJ Colonel Belly’s No. 172-G2, of 23rd May 1870, with enclosures, the summary of which is con cisely given in the Office Note of June 15th, 1870. 82. The Chief of Aboothabee has returned to his post from Beraymee, having left in the latter place some forty of the followers of Azan bin Ghais to protect their master’s interests. Syud Toorkee is at Debaye and entertains hopes of attacking Beraymee. lie is looking for the “ support of Mahomed bin Ali, the Chief of the Naeem tribe. In the opinion of the Native Agent at Shargah this Chief is not favorable to his cause. The Chief of Aboothabee is said to have expressed his determination to remain neutral. The other Chiefs of the Littoral have promised to help him, if he can also enlist the support of Mahomed bin Ali. The reply of the latter is being awaited. Colonel Pelly cannot see that Syud Toorkee's cause progresses much. Svud loorkee is also in correspondence with the Sheikhs of the Batinah and Jaalan. His difficulty ^ that he has no money. Amongst the present papers is a translation of his letter to Colonel felly asking for a loan of 20,000$. This request His Excellency has already declined to entertain. . ^ 83. Syud Toorkee failed in his endeavour to gain support for Mahomed bin Ah, and retired to Bunder Abbass. In anticipation of his attempting to operate thence by sea against Muscat, the Bombay Government was requested to inform him through Colonel Pelly that the rules regarding the preservation of the maritime peace still remained in force. Syud Salem was then at Kishm. Colonel Pelly told Major Smith on the Aral) Coast to return at once to Bushire with the Kwantung. ofstItc Snewsformeddespatch No ‘ 122 ’ dated 24th June 1870, to Secretar y84. The despatch No. 128, dated 15th July 1870, to Secretary of State, continues the chain of events :— “ From letters written towards the close of May it appears that the troops of Azan bin Gheis were still besieging- the fort of Azan. As the garrison has proved itself to be stronger than was expected, and the Governor has intimated his intention of resisting to the last, it is possible that the siege may continue for some time. The neighbouring Batineh tribes are averse to the fortress falling into the hands of Azan bin Gheis, it being considered by them as a place of refuge for their families and property in time of danger. In Colonel Felly’s opinion the Imam would not be acting as he is, if he had not great confidence in Ins power to accom plish his object. The Ameer of Nejd before withdrawing to Riadh left Abdoollah bin Soweylim with 3,0U0 men at Guttur. The Ameer’s brother, Mahomed bin Feysul, is at Lahsa. “ As regards Syud Toorkee, the information last received by telegraph of 2nd July shows that, being unable for want of means to keep his men together, he had left Bunder Abbass with 40 followers on the British Ship Mozuffer ostensibly for Bombay. It was, however, suspected that he intended to divert the ship’s course towards Muscat and to land at some point of that coast. Colonel Felly has therefore started in the hope of overtaking him (he was last seen with seven crafts of Persian Coast towards Cape Jask). We have instructed Colonel Felly not to lay hands on Syud Toorkee, unless he is evidently bent on armed attack on some part of the Coast of Oman, and we have expressed our opinion that it might be sufficient to warn him, and recommend him to proceed on the Mozuffer to any place that he may choose out of Mus- cat territory. We have added that Syud Toorkee must not be taken prisoner, if his capture can possibly be avoided.” 85. It also appeared that “ the Chief of Aboothabee had sent a horse as a present to Azan bin Gheis and asked for pecuniary help, provisions to be sent to him in return, but no money. The neighbouring Chiefs of the Littoral had entered into an engagement with this Chief to be steadfast to Azan bin Gheis. According to the Native Agent at Shargah, although the Chief of Aboothabee had promised to interest himself in his neighbours’ behalf, he was in reality setting Azan bin Gheis against them.” 86 . Ou 12th July 1870 Colonel Felly telegraphed— “ Svud Toorkee has put back to Bunder Abbass, having postponed further movements till opening of fair season, and sent his native craft to Khor Fekkan.” This was communicated to the Secretary of State. Inaccuracy of Statement of the Government of Bombay that Syud Toorkee left Bombay by the authority of the Government of India. 87. In forwarding the letter of 2 nd July 1870 from Colonel Felly, the Bombay Government added— “ Felly has been instructed as follows:—Syud Toorkee should be prevented landing. He left Telegram from Governor of Bom- Bombay by the authority of the Government of India, and bay to the Viceroy, dated July 3rd, His Excellency knows no reason why he should not be per- 1870. mitted to return. Mere suspicion would not justify his cap ture without overt act of aggression.” 88 . As the Government of India could not admit the accuracy of the statement that Syud Toorkee left Bombay by the authority of the Government of India, when in fact his departure was neither known to, nor authorized • No. m 2 P„ d.,od 17 th jui, iwo. them &gt; ^ a &lt;l fis P a tch * to the Bombay Government, reviewing the tacts :— “ 2.

N0 ' 1461, r. l r[ d ;r 1 '? be . It WM, -however, observed that f should a large and influential portion of the Chiefs and people signify their fixed intention of recalling Syud Salim, or of inviting Syud Toorkee, totake up power, His Excellency in Council would be disposed readily to acquiesce in such a wish, and to allow the person so selected or invited by public opinion to return to Muscat, and to resume or enjoy supreme authority in the State. But until this desire shall be clearly manifested by the people, or by a reasonable majority thereof. His Excellency in Council would be ready to employ force in order to prevent either Syud Salem or Syud Toorkee from making- any warlike attempt to effect their respective objects from the sea-board. “ 3. On the 10th February 1869 the Bombay Government communicated by telegraph the opinion of the Political Agent at Muscat that the election of Syud Toorkee as Euler would be more than ever acceptable to the majority of the people of Oman. On the same day, His Excellency the Governor of Bombay addressed a confidential letter to His Excellency the Viceroy advocating, in strong terms, the claims of Syud Toorkee, and showing the advantages to the British Government and to the people of Oman which were likely to ensue from his accession To Government of Bombay, No. 241, the Sultanate The Government of India accepted the dated 17th February 1869. change in circumstances which had taken place since the issue of their letter of 11th December 1868, and withdrew the pro hibition on Syud Toorkee's leaving Bombay. But it was expressly provided that he was not to be allowed a British ship-of-war for his voyage, and that no pledge of protection or help was to be given him in respect of any attempt that he might make to establish his authority over Muscat. It was at the same time enjoined that if any change had occurred in the interval between the receipt of the Political Agent’s report that Syud Toorkee was likely to be acceptable in Muscat, and the issue of the Supreme Government’s letter allowing him to return, the restriction previously imposed on him was to continue in force. “ 4. Syud Toorkee did not avail himself of the permission then given him to depart, but remained at Bombay for a further period of more than twelve months. The first intimation received by the Supreme Government of his absence from Bombay w r as in a telegram from the Bombay Government, dated 31st March last, at the end of which it was announced that ‘ Syud Toorkee is said to be at Bunder Abbass.’ “ 5- Judging by the correspondence above alluded to, which contains all that has passed between the Supreme Government and the Government of Bombay since November 1868 on the subject of Syud Toorkee’s departure, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council cannot admit the accuracy of the statement made to the Resident in the Persian Gulf that Syud Toorkee left Bombay by the authority of the Government of India, nor can he regard the —.conditional permission granted in February 1869 as applicable to a totally different state of affairs in March 1870. That permission was given under special circumstances reported by the Bombay Government at a time when the power of Azan bin Gheis to maintain Ids authority was doubtful, and when it was believed that Syud Toorkee would have been welcomed by a large and influential party of the Chiefs and people of Oman. In the interval which elapsed before he actually took his departure, Azan bin Gheis had succeeded in firmly establishing his rule. Syud Toorkee, therefore, when he left Bombay, did so under circumstances which would have rendered the authority given in February 1869 quite inapposite, even if that authority had been general and permanent, instead of being, as it was manifestly intended to be, special and temporary.” 89. The Bombay Government replied :— “ His Excellency the Governor in Council is unable to accept the construction of Mr. Seton-Karr’s letter of the 17th February 1869, now given by the Government of India. The Governor in Council does not find that that letter contains any intimation that the restriction before placed upon His Highness Syud Toorkee, namely, that he should not be per mitted to leave Bombay for any other destination whatever was to continue in force if he did not then avail himself of the permission then given to return to Muscat. The 5 th paragraph of that letter records in explicit terms the intention of the Government of India to be' that any restriction as to the residence of Syud Toorkee should be taken off, as well as that all prohibition regarding his embarkation from Bombay should be withdrawn. “ 3- In the letter under reply two things are dealt with, \stly i the permission to return to Muscat in consequence of the report made by the Political Agent that His Highness Syud Toorkee’s return would be acceptable to the people of Oman. This impliedly was not to be given if any change had taken place before the letter of the Government of India of 11 th December 1868 was received; and Zudly, the withdrawal of any restriction as to the place of His Highness’ residence, which was understood by this Government to be general and uncon ditional, a construction which His Excellency in Council thinks the words and general tenor of Mr. Seton-Karr’s letter fully justify.” *• 90. The Government of India closed * the controversy, as His Excellency * No - J 574r -&gt; 3 rd September in Council adhered to his opinion and saw no 18 ' 0 ' advantage to be gained in a discussion of the terms ol Mr. Seton-Karr’s letter of 17th February 1809.r ( 26 ) The remark was repeated that “ as a matter of fact the departure of Syud Toorkee was Telegram to Polical Secretary, Bombay, dated 1st April 1870. „ from „ „ „ „ 4th „ „ Letter „ „ „ „ „ 4th „ „ No. 127. „ „ „ „ „ „ 14th „ „ „ 135. not even known to the Government of India, far less permitted by them, as a reference to the tele grams and letters marginally noted will show.” Return of Syud Toorliee to power continued. . 91. On 3rd August 1870, in their No. 261, the Bombay Government trans mitted letters from Colonel Felly connected with Syud Toorkee’s proceedings in relation to the Muscat State, with his correspondence with Native Agents on the Arab coast, and the Political Agent, Muscat. The dates of all these were anterior to the telegram of 12 th July from Colonel Felly, in which the return of Syud Toorkee to Bunder Abbass was reported. The main features were given in the Office Note of 17th August:— “ Before leaving Debaye for the Persian Coast Syud Toorkee had received from Hajee Ahmed, the Governor of Bunder Abbass, horses, camels, and pow'der to a small extent. His hopes were also momentarily raised by letters from certain Chiefs of Jaalan and Soor, who were at enmity with Azan bin Gheis and consequently showed a disposition to take part of his rival. They were willing to make a descent on' Soor and proceed thence by land to Muscat, but would not co-operate in an attack against Muscat from the sea. They appeared to have been at Bunder Abbass after the arrival of Syud Toorkee at that post, but if they had any personal communication with him, nothing came of it, as they left by themselves some days before Syud Toorkee took his departure on board the Mozujfer. There was reason to believe that early in June Syud Majid was intriguing with the Chiefs of the Littoral on Syud Tookee's behalf, having sent presents to all except the Sheikh of Aboothabee, whose alliance with Azan bin Gheis was probably so well known to him that he deemed it useless to attempt to win him over. Syud Majid was also reported to have warned the people of Batinah and Soor, whom he found at Zanzibar, that if they did not aid Syud Toorkee in taking Muscat, they should not be allowed to appear again on the Zanzibar Coast. Accordingly they promised assistance, but whether their number or their influence in Oman was sufficient to give any value to their promise was not stated. The authorities of Muscat about this period took precautions by increasing the garrisons of their maritime forts, but in the opinion of the Political Agent their measures were no more than would have been taken to guard against surprise by any enemy. Their whole bearing showed that they had full confidence in themselves. Major Wav still adhered to the view expressed in the March previous that Azan bin Gheis ‘ holds the reins of Government with a tighter hand than any of the late reigning Sidtans have/ “ Syud Toorkee’s followers from Debaye were variously estimated from 50 to 90 men. The party crossed in boats belonging to Hajee Ahmed. The reason that he lingered on the Arab Coast after all chance of obtaining support from the Chiefs had disappeared was probably that he expected letters from Zanzibar. Notwithstanding that he had the good will of the Persian Governor (Hajee Ahmed) at Bunder Abbass, he could collect no considerable force. Accordingly he embarked on board the Mozuffer, his passage money to the amount of Rupees 1,500 having been furnished by Hajee Ahmed. He himself was quite without funds, and his object was said to have been to return to Bombay in order to induce the British Goverment to continue his pension. Feeling this, he meant to return with his family to Bunder Abbass, and thence to renew his attempts against Muscat. “Colonel Pelly^s letters, No. 257-157, dated July 2 nd, and No. 267-83, dated 10th July 1870, addressed respectively to the Political Agent at Muscat and to the Bombay Government concisely recounted the proceedings of Syud Toorkee on the Persian Coast, and the circumstances of his return in the Mozuffer. He also intimated the existence of a belief in the south of the Persian Gulf that the British Government, though not actively helping Syud Toorkee, did not disapprove of his conduct and would not prevent operations on his part by sea against Muscat territory. The Resident had taken proper steps for removing this impression. He had also assured Azan bin Gheis that our policy for the maintenance of the maritime peace had in no wise been changed. “ The Political Agent at Muscat called attention to the injury which traders suffer so lone as this uncertainty about Syud Toorkee continues, and raised the question whether he should be permitted to make further attempts, which, to judge by experience, would only be futile thoueh they affect the tranquillity and welfare of the country. Colonel Pelly was of opinion that it is too late now for Syud Toorkee to hope for success in any unaided efforts that he might make i(b ^r\ ( 27 ) against the rule of Azan bin Gheis, though he was not prepared to say what might be the result if the Ameer of the Wahabees were successful in a war against the Imam. “ I he siege of Azan was still going on, the taotics of Azan bin Gheis being to starve out the garrison. One or two successful sorties had been made by the besieged. “ Colonel Pelly brought to notice the inconvenience which he was suffering by havino- one Assistant short, Major Way having been deputed to Muscat, and no substitute having been^sent. J his was a point for the consideration of the Bombay Government, but no allusion was made to it in Mr. Wedderburn's covering letter.” An Tlie ‘ interest of t,1( ‘ se papers was superseded by the telegram of the 10 th August from the Bombay Government, which ran thus :— “ Col i )n f telegraphed on sixth as follows f Bunder Abbass Governor writes that Zanzibar oultan has sent by war-ship Prince of Wales bill on Jairam Sewiee of Bombay for twenty thousand dollars in favor of Syud Toorkee. Firm of Jairam instructed that if Wahabee Ameer aid Toorkee against Oman should pay any and all money required. Governor adds that ioorkee writes from Menas that he intends proceeding to Kuteef to join Wahabee Ameer I — proceeding to Bahrein in Hwang lung, moving thence to Muscat if advisable.' “By desire of His Excellency I telegraphed on the seventh as follows:—‘What is vour object in proceeding to Bahrein ? Explain your views more fullv.' To which Colonel Pellv rephed as follows Your telegram of seventh. Wahabee Ameer having written complaining ot Balnem Chief in respect to tribute payment, harbouring traitors, etcetera: added that Bahrein belonged to him, that he purposed attacking it, and suggested removal of British subjects. My object in going there was to see Bahrein Chief and, if possible, adjust difficulties . lsin £ hira t 0 refrain from all unnecessary cause of offence. Under the circumstances reported m my other telegram of to-day, concerning Zanzibar Sultan's proceedings, I think I should move direct to Bunder Abbass, and at present simply write to Ameer and Bahrein Chief recom mending amicable adjustment. Zanzibar Sultan's interference for general disturbance of Gulf peace must, I fear lead to commotion and aggression. If Wahabee Ameer endeavours to ictake Beraymee with the lakh of dollars placed at his disposal, he will probably first try to injure Bahrein where his disaffected brother is. In event of attack is gun-boat to prevent it or supply look on and take off our subjects?’— Message ends. t t, or “ Further telegram of same day received on ninth as follows‘ I have lust seen onn. hdential letter from Bunder Abbass Governor, stating that Zanzibar Sultan has sent three bills -one for twenty thousand dollars for Syud Toorkee's immediate use, one for thirty thousand to be paid on loorkee's taking Soor, one for lakh dollars to be paid to Wahabee Ameer on his taking Sohar. Further aid is promised. War-vessel Prince of Wales is placed at Bunder Abbass Governors disposal, with promise of another if this do not suit. Governor recom mended 1 oorkee who has hired large native craft to proceed direct and land at Soor. Beport of four crafts with Persians and Belooehees having landed at Soor and been joined by detachment ot Jaalan tribes confirmed. Major Way has warned British subjects at Soor. Action of Zanzibar Sultan calculated to disturb Arab Coast throughout entire length. If attempt is still to be made to prevent Toorkee landing on Muscat Coast, I submit I should be permitted to em iaik foi Bunder Abbass forthwith, observe Toorkee's movements and proceed to Muscat Muscat authorities likely to become irritated at combined proceedings of Toorkee and Zanzibar I recommend that vessel of war be sent t Q Muscat to protect British interests.' Further telegram received this morning as follows‘ Following from Major Way Amnist 8 th •— Matters at last reported^ confirmed.

But His Excellent requests instructions whether he shall desire Resident to prevent his going to Soor if alone or with his personal servants only. It appears to His Excellency that we are not called on by the maritime truce to do so. Our position has hitherto been that we prevent actual warlike operations on sea, but otherwise remain strictly neutral. We are still less called on to prevent his embarkation now without troops for Kuteef.'' ^ iM. The Government of India answered the above on the 11 th August: Svn/lWr tele £ rams _ of J 0th - Views and instructious of Bombay Government in regard to of mariW^/bylny party.^ ^ hiS ^ t0 Panting breach( 28 ) “ Warn Jairam Sewjee that if, by honoring* bills referred to by Resident, he abets waging- war against Muscat or Bahrein, being Asiatic powers at peace with the Queen, be is liable to prosecution under Section 125 of Indian Penal Code, and may on conviction be transported for life. “Is it considered advisable to send vessel-of-war to Gulf.” 95. On the 24th and 25th August the Bombay Government again for warded Colonel Belly’s telegram that Syud Toorkee was credibly reported to have proceeded to Soor with some 40 followers in a bugla, intending there to join his advanced parties of some 200 men who had already landed and were awaiting him in a position where they were enabled to prevent egress of Soor craft. Colonel Belly asked for early instructions as to when he should interfere, as Syud Toorkee would move with first shift of wind. 96. The Government of India replied (25th August):— “ Unless maritime truce is broken and warlike operations are being carried on by sea, no interference should take place. Colonel Felly should not prevent Toorkee going to Soor alone or with a few followers. Viceroy agrees with opinion expressed in your telegram of tenth.” 97. On the 7th September 1S70, in their No. 307, the Bombay Govern ment transmitted the answer of Messrs. Jairam Sewjee, Bombay, with regard to the hills drawn in favor of Syud Toorkee :— “As far as our present advices go, we have a bill of exchange, dated Ashad Shood 10th, drawn upon us for Rupees 20,000 by our corresponding firm at Zanzibar at one month's sight in favor of His Highness Syud Toorkee. It would appear that His Highness the Sultan paid into our firm at Zanzibar the sum of Rupees 20,000 and got a hill in favor of His Highness Toorkee, payable at one month's sight. This hill was presented to us on the 15th instant and falls due on the 18th September next, on which day money must be paid by us. “We would beg to observe that, without having the remotest idea of furnishing to His Highness Syud Toorkee the means of equipping an expedition, and without, moreover, the least i intention on our part of aiding him in breaking the maritime peace in the Persian Gulf, it would be a flagrant breach of contract on our part—a contract which could be enforced against | us in any Court of Justice in Her Majesty's dominions—not to pay at maturity our acceptances / drawn by our own corresponding house at Zanzibar after our having honored them. It would, j moreover, involve the loss of credit and commercial honor of our firm, which we are bound to : maintain, without, we would take the liberty to repeat, our having the least intention of sup- \ porting any person to carry on a expedition against any power in alliance with Her Majesty the Queen. “ If the Political Agent at Zanzibar while reporting to Government on the subject, had given a due note of warning to our firm at Zanzibar, as you have been so kind to inform us here, our firm would have refused to grant any drafts such as those which may have been granted. “ We shall of course advise our firm at Zanzibar, by the mail which leaves this on the 31st instant, not to grant drafts of the kind mentioned in your letter. Such drafts, however, as may have been already granted by our firm before the date of our advice we are in honor bound to accept and pay, as otherwise, in case of non-acceptance, we shall be compelled by any Court of Justice to pay them.” The Government of India decided that no orders were needed, as Messrs. Jairam and Co. had had their warning. 98. Colonel Belly telegraphed from Bushire on September 16th:— “ Syud Toorkee landed at Kher Fekkan and proceeded towards Beraymee. Wahabee force and Aboothabee Chief asserted to be approaching Beraymee. Syud Abdool Azeez states that he is proceeding to Soor to join Syud Toorkee. I think more probably he will go to Mekran. Advices from Bahrein bring satisfactory assurances that Chief will hold aloof from Wahabee affairs, but apprehends annoyance from Wahabees.” This was forwarded to the Secretary of State. 99. Further details of Oman affairs up to 13th September 1870 were con tained in No. 338 of 12 th Octoher, and No. 342 of 14th October, from Bombav Government:— “ Azan bin Gheis was then to the north of his capital, but his exact whereabouts was not known, no news having been received from him for many days previously. His object was to reduce the Naeem and other tribes on the north-western frontier. This strong inclination to centralize and to deprive of their independence tribes whom his predecessors refrained from1 ( 29 ) x 11 intruding upon was only intelligible to Colonel Pelly on the supposition that Azan bin Gheis was very confident of his own strength. The Resident looked upon his present policy as rash and unnecessary, but he could not conceal from himself that it had been largely successful during the last two years. Syud Toorkee was said to have landed at Khor Fekkan and to be proceeding towards Beraymee with the intention of joining the tribes in those regions against Azan bin Gheis. Syud Abdool Azeez had also given out his intention of making common cause with Syud Toorkee. Colonel Pelly was disposed to think that he was not unlikely to intrigue on his own account with the view of supplanting the influence of Nusseer bin Thoweynee at Charbar and along the Mekran Coast. In August last Colonel Pelly reported that the Ex-Chief of Shargah, Salim bin Sultan, was endeavouring to recover the place. The operations were, however, entirely by land, and therefore the local Agent was warned not to mix himself up with the quarrel. Colonel Pelly gave later news about Oman. Azan bin Gheis and Syud Toorkee had each scored a victory, but the latter was considered to have had the best of the contest. The Chief of Bahrein was blockading Kuteef for fear lest the Wahabees should issue thence with hostile intent against his territories/’ 100. Colonel Pelly discussed the policy of Azan bin Gheis and the His No. 346-110, of 3rd September, in No. 344 of 19th October, from likelihood of Syud Toorkee’s Bombay Government. SUCCCSS * “ Before concluding this letter, I would respectfully submit a few remarks on the present aspect of affairs in the Muscat State. It appears to me that, whatever may be the personal feelings of parties as towards Syud Azan’s Government or towards aspirants to power from the Syud Saeed’s dynasty, the main question which underlies these feelings is that of centralization versus feudality. Under the Syud Saeed branch every Chief, and more particularly the warlike Chiefs, of the interior and south were respected and their authority little interfered with. Many of them were rarely or never visited by the Sultans, to whom they paid little or no revenue. Prom time to time they were invited to the capital, and received money or presents from the Sultans themselves. “ But the Government of Azan Khulelee has been an attempt to cripple the independent power of the Chiefs and to supplant them by local governors or deputies of the central powder. In carrying out this policy, Khulelee brought the influence of religion to bear, w'hile Syud Azan and Sheik Sala visited in person the large majority of the tribes, and, whether by force, artifice, or a system of hostages, contrived to reduce .them to a state of obedience to the central power. “ Considered from a European point of view, precedents might be found for similar attempts made successfully. But it is, perhaps, open to doubt whether such a policy would be perma nently practicable amongst the Arabs. “ At all events, the Azan Government seem to have given rise to much irritation amongst the Chiefs by their confinement of hostages, while from without the Wahabee Government, always of course desirous to re-capture Beraymee, appears now to be influencing the Naeem and other tribes on the north-west of the Muscat territories against the authority of Azan’s Govern ment. And it is probable that when the bribe offered by Zanzibar to the Wahabee Ameer for the capture of the northern part of the Muscat dominions shall be generally known, it w r ill excite the cupidity of the tribes and increase the chances of attack. “ Meantime Syud Azan, with his brother Ebrahim and Sheik Sala, are on or near that frontier with a considerable force, apparently as arrogant and confident as ever in their power to coerce the refractory tribes. It is generally and officially reported also that the Aboothabee Chief is himself at Beraymee with intent to aid Azan in his coercive measures. “ It is remarkable that, although the advent of Syud Toorkee in the south has for some time been expected, the Azan Government appear to deem the difficulty on the Wahabee frontier of a graver or more emergent character, since they ignore the tribes of the south when Toorkee is expected and proceed north. “So far as Syud Toorkee is concerned, the prospects of His Highness seem (if he be prompt and active) more favourable than they have been. Former orders of Government have been, to some degree, relaxed in his favour; the intervention of the Sultan of Zanzibar has at least afforded him funds and credit ; the desire of the Wahabee Government for retaliation on Azan, combined with the money assurances to that power from Zanzibar, would be likely to constitute a valuable diversionary aid in Toorkee’s favour; and many tribal Chiefs would probably hope to regain their influence and their independence under a member of the Syud Saeed branch. On the other hand, the difficulties of Syud Toorkee after landing may prove numerous. I he two principal tribes in the south are the Beni-boo-Ali and the Beni-boo-Hassan, w r ho are usually in a state of feud. It is probable the Beni-boo-Ali wmuld join Toorkee at once, but, as usual, the arrangement would involve presents and time. It is possible that, at all events, a portion at the Beni-boo-Hassan might be induced to join, but this again would involve expen diture, and the alliance might not prove very reliable. Then the Jenebah and the Hejriyenwould have in be gained, and this in turn would involve time and money. Then the question of the great tribal division of the Muscat territory would have to be considered, viz., the Henavee and the Ghafree. Of these two divisions, the Ghafree is estimated the more nume rous, but is somewhat divided, while the Henavee are supposed to be in favour of the present dynasty, and might, perhaps, apprehend that its subversion would result in then abasement and in the elevation of the Ghafree. “ In any case, unless the invasion be accomplished by an initial enthusiasm, the aggrega tion of force would require time and constant expenditure. It is unlikely that the existing Government would vacate without a struggle. It might so happen that Syud looi cee would find his purse exhausted when ■affairs were on the balance, and when Khuleelee might xgin to open his'purse in view to turning the scale. The influence of the Muthowahs, diffused as they are through nearly all the tribes, would no doubt be great; and I trust I do not wrong the priestly character'of Khuleelee when I express a doubt whether, other means failing, he would hesitate to employ one of his fanatical subordinates as an assassin. “ Should Syud Toorkee succeed in taking Muscat, it would not of necessity follow that Syud Azan would abdicate the Imamship, or his colleagues wholly resign power. In old days Nuzwah and Rostak were successively the so-called capital of these territories, and I under stand that the present Government are said to have always been in favour of having the capital at one of the above or some other inland point, while the difficulties of the new Ruler would be very grave from a financial point of view. « Put whatever may be the political event, I would earnestly remark that the trade and general interests of the Muscat State appear to me to render some permanent condition of affairs, under a recognized Ruler, very desirable. « I need not add that, in thus generally remarking on the present aspect of affairs, I con tinue carefully to refrain from prediction. In fact, the more I see and learn of Arabs the stronger becomes my conviction that the tribes themselves are often uncertain of their own action. An accident or the longest purse may decide the day, and when decided, restlessness and cupidity may at once endeavour to contrive the means of disturbing the settlement arrived at.” 101. The Bombay Government* thought Colonel Felly was right not to prevent Svud Toorkee from proceeding on his * No. 344, dated 19th October 1870. 1 course. . “ With respect to the remark made by Colonel Felly in his 33rd paragraph, that the orders of Government had been relaxed in Syud' Toorkee’s favor, the Bombay Government observed that their orders, in which the Government of India concurred, were that the maritime truce should be enforced, but that it should not be extended to bring under its operation circumstances and persons to which it did not properly apply. “ Explanation was called for with reference to the statement that some of the ammu nition in possession of His Highness Syud Toorkee’s party was of the Government pattern.” The Government of India approved of the orders of the Bombay Govern ment. 102. On receipt of the narrativef of events in Oman between September t No. 36 fi, dated 15 th November 1870, 8 th and October 28th, 1870, the Bombay Govern- from Bombay Government. merit were Called Oil to forward Copies of reports from the Persian Gulf and Muscat with greater despatch as the public news papers had more than once recently conveyed intelligence faster than the official reports. They were requested to adhere to the practice prescribed in No. 430, dated 25th March 1869, to Government of Bombay, and to conform to the instructions laid down in 171P. of 24th January 1870, from Foreign Department. 103. The Bombay Government answered (No. 420 of 28th December 1870.) “ The Government of India desire that the reports from the Persian Gulf and Muscat should be forwarded with greater despatch. In order to carry out this object, His Excellency had already adopted a system which it is hoped will have the desired result. Under the instruc- qiqc r., , i Qtjn tions marginally noted (copy appended), news-reports are now °' ’' 1 ° er furnished every mail by the Political Resident at Aden, the Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Muscat, the Political Agent at Zanzibar, and the Commissioner in Sind. Immediately on receipt, copies of these reports are sent to the Government of India from the Office in Bombay, and in this way the Right Honffile the Vice roy and Governor-General in Council will in future be very promptly and regularly informed of current events.”( 31 ) Of this the Government of India approved. 104. News-reports of Oman affairs, enclosed in Nos. 370 and 372, dated 22nd and 23rd November, from Bombay Government, contained Syud Toorkee’s admission that he sustained a repulse at Beraymee. “ At Zunk he amply retrieved his fortunes. The fact of the rout of Azan bin Gheis at the latter place was communicated to the Bombay Government by Colonel Felly in a telegram from Bushire, dated 17th October. No copy of that telegram was ever transmitted to the Supreme Government. “ The enclosure to No. 370 was a concise narrative of events in the Persian Gulf up to * soooos. November, and in Oman up to 14th November. The report of pecuniary aid* to a considerable extent from Zanzi bar to Syud Toorkee was again repeated. But whatever the money from that quarter Syud loorkee was still short of funds. There was a rumour which needed corroboration, that in his march from Soor towards Muscat he was deserted by the tribes who had supported him and had been obliged to fall back on Soor. Syud Azan was laid up with a swollen knee at Sohar for some time, but was able to return to Muscat on the 10 th of November. The garrisons at Muscat and Muttra were not strong, their aggregate number being computed at 800 lighting men. Beraymee was still held by the Sheikh of Aboothabee for Azan bin Gheis, and it was said that the Naeem and Druah tribes have, through that Chief, tendered their sub mission to the Imam, and had offered to surrender Zunk to him. The trade of Muscat was almost at a stand-still, the British subjects having sent all valuable property on board the ships and being icady themselves to follow at a momenCs notice. The Muscat authorities had issued a notice that goods shipped without their permission and re-landed would be liable to duty. “ Th® Chief of Bahrein, acting on the Resident’s suggestion, persuaded the rebellious brother of the Wahabee Ameer to leave the island and ceased to interfere with the seaborne trade of Kuteef. An attack upon a Bunya by an Aboothabee subject and a piracy on a Kutch bugla by Arabs were being enquired into, with a view of justice being done to the sufferers.” These papers formed despatch No. 252 of 14th December 1870, to Secre tary of State. 105. From the enclosures in the Bombay Government letter No. 398 of 8 th December it appeared that— a ^hij or W ay visited Soor on the 29th of October in order to warn Syud Toorkee against under- taknig operations by sea, and received an assurance from His Highness that he had no intention of disobeying the orders of Her Majesty’s Government on this point. He declined to comply with the Syud’s request for an interview. He instructed the Commander of the Hugh Rose to take steps for stopping the approach of armed men by sea against Muscat. He repeated what His Excellency knew before, that the Muscat Government had notified to all persons shipping goods without its orders that they would not be allowed to re-land property so shipped without payment of customs duty at the same rate as if the goods had been newly imported into the country. This ruling, he urged, being contrary to Treaty could not apply to British subjects, but he did not intend to notice it till a British subject was charged duty.f The stipulation to which he alluded was the 9th Article of the Treaty of 1839, quoted in the foot-note below.” 106. For some time Syud Toorkee’s inability to oppose the de facto Gov ernment of Muscat was patent owing to the desertions of his followers. Some Beni boo llussan Chiefs visited Syud Azan, and received pardon for havin°* lately joined Syud Toorkee. Subsequently Syud Toorkee— “ left Soor wit h a force for the purpose of again attacking Syud Azan at Muscat. The Com mander of the Ilugk Rose was instructed to take steps for stopping the approach of armed men by sea against the latter place. The Muscat Government was asked to make arrangements to secure the safety of the British subjects there.” (No. 20 to Secretary of State, dated 25th June 1871.) 107. The result of this expedition was communicated to the Secretary of State, No. 134 of 15th February 1871. + No duty exceeding' 5 per cent, shall be levied at the place of entry in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan „ 'f cat on , an y S 00 ^ 8 ’ the growth, produce, or manufacture of the dominions of Her Britannic Maiestv, imported bv British vessels, and this duty shall he deemed to be a full payment of all import and export and tonnage duties of license to trade, of pilotage and anchorage, and of any other charge by Government whatever upon the vessels or upon the goods so imported or exported.

(Sumud lies due south of Samayel and southwest of Muscat in about latitude 22° 50' N. and longitude 58° 20' E.) From Sumud Syud Toorkee proposed to take the direct road to Muscat. On the 12th of the same month his Lieutenant Syf bin Suliman had taken Kuryat on the coast between Muscat and Soor. He had separated from Syud Toorkee shortly after they left Soor, and had marched by the coast route, whilst Syud Toorkee had chosen the more circuitous road which skirts the northern part of the province of Jaalan and leads through Sumud and Semayel to Muscat. He was said to have advanced from Kuryat towards Rooee above Mutrah on the 17th of January. Meanwhile Sheikh Saleh, one of the members of the Muscat Govern ment, had been ordered to proceed to Sunaud, and Azan bin Gheis and his brother Ibrahim were busily engaged in preparing for the defence of Muscat and Mutrah. Ammunition was being served out to the garrisons of these fortified towns; the persons residing outside of the walls of Mutrah had been called in, forced loans were being exacted, and additional taxation was being imposed to provide the sinews of war, and British subjects had been warned by the Political Agent to leave Muscat territory. So affairs stood up to the 20 th of January. Apparently, on the 30th, Syf bin Suliman attacked Azan bin Ghies in Mutrah, and obtained possesssion for Syud Toorkee of all but two forts. Both Syf bin Suliman and Azan bin Grheis lost their lives in the fight. Colonel Pelly, on obtaining this intel ligence, repaired at once to Muscat. On the 3rd of this month he telegraphed thence through Gwadur that Khulelee, the priestly Minister of Azan bin Gheis, held the forts, but that the troops of the late Syf bin Suliman held the towns, referring, probably, to the forts and towns of Muscat and Mutrah. Sheikh Saleh then occupied the forts of Sumud. By his position there he had evidently so far been able to check the advance of Syud Toorkee, who was believed to be in his neighbourhood. The expectation was that Syud Toorkee would shortly arrive before Muscat. Ibrahim bin Gheis had fled northwards to the Batineh. The forts in this province were in the hands of the adherents of Azan bin Gheis, but, as he was dead, Colonel Pelly doubted whether they would be able to hold together.” 108. The Foreign Secretary’s opinion on the situation was thus given:— “ The death of Azan bin Gheis gives a new phase to the subsidy question. It also gives a good opportunity for reviving our relations with Muscat, if His Excellency in Council think it desirable to do so. I think it would be wise to take advantage of the present state of affairs quietly to withdraw from the position we have assumed in the sea of Oman, and to limit our protectorate to the Persian Gulf. No communication need be made to the Muscat Government, whoever is now or may be hereafter in power. All that is needed is to instruct the Agent for the future to abstain from interfering in the event of operations being conducted by sea along the Oman coast. We shall probably never have so good a chance again of receding from a false position.” 109. On 13th February 1871, in his No. 153-33, Colonel Pelly descrihed his share in the negociations which ended in a declaration* of peace between Syud Toorkee and Khulelee :— “ The first thing which he secured was an armistice. Then he allowed the Vakeels of the contending parties to meet at the Agency as a neutral ground, where they might discuss conditions without danger to their persons. When terms had been agreed on and recorded in a formal document, Colonel Pelly and the Political Agent attested the signatures of the Vakeels.” 110. The translated purport of the agreement ran :— “ Be it known to all concerned that peace has been made between me, Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee, and His Highness Syud Toorkee bin Saeed bin Sultan on the conditions detailed below:— “First .—That I should not be answerable for having entered into the (service of the late) Government and for the changes that had taken place affecting persons and property during the reign of that Government. “ Second. —That I should reside where I like, and he (Syud Toorkee) should protect me from molestation and from any person who might bring charges against me, and that I in turn should not countenance, or encourage, or put up any enemies against him, or entertain any ill intentions towards him. “ Third —In regard to property sold, it should remain as it is; and if any such property belong to any person, and he demand it, it should not be given to him unless on payment of its value to the purchaser (who now holds it.) “ Fourth .—In regard to the dates belonging to Towaynee bin Mahomed, what remain of them should be returned to him, and what have been consumed should be paid for by Syud Toorkee. *&lt;f Fifth .—All claims or demands should be (considered as) settled : great many demands and claims might be preferred against me by the people. Syud Toork.ee should relieve me of the responsibility thereof. “ Sixth. The salaries of the troops and other expences incurred by me (should be paid.) “ Seventh. The rice and other provisions in the forts should not be interfered with. Eighth. The provisions made by these conditions should extend to all who had a hand with me in the (late) Government, and to all who depend on me, and those who depend on my dependants. “ Ninth .—The promises and engagments of Syud Toorkee should be in the writing of Colonel Pelly. Also the promises of the GhafPgfee and Henavee Sheikhs, viz., Abdoollah bin Saulem bin Hamudeh, Yusef bin Alee, Homaid bin Khalifeh, Nauser bin Ameer, Naujem bin Mahomed, and any others whom they would wish to have with themseves. Tenth. Some person should escort my people to the place they would wish to go.” 111 . Colonel Pelly deelined that the assurances of Syud Toorkee should be in his writing, as suggested in paragraph 9 of the agreement. His letter proceeded :— “ Major W ay and 1 then appended our signatures as witnesses, prefacing the same with an explanatory minute as follows :— “ f Certified that His Highness Syud Toorkee and Sheikh Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee having requested the good offices of the undersigned in view towards terminating the present conflict, the undersigned have accorded their good offices to the following extent, viz., 1st, of inducing an armistice; 2nd, of permitting the Vakeels of His Highness Syud Toorkee and of Sheikh Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee, respectively, to meet in the British Consulate, where, as a neutral ground, they might confer without danger to their persons, and 3rd, of certifying that the signatures of the \ akeels appointed by His Highness Syud Toorkee and by Sheikh Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee were attached to the above deed (purporting to be a deed of agreement) in the presence of the undersigned. But it has been clearly explained to, and is clearly understood by, all parties concerned that, in according good offices to the extent above specified, the undersigned in no manner or degree accept for themselves, or commit the British ^-Gyvernment to, any guarantee or responsibility whatsoever in regard to any provision, condition, stipulation, or other matters of whatsoever character which the said deed may contain. “ f The signatures oFffiemn4ersigned are attached simply and purely as those of witnesses to the facts of the meeting having had place, and of the deed having been signed bv the Vakeels.’ ” 112. In his No. 154-34 of the same date he said-— “ No reliable intelligence of the movement of Syuds Ibrahim and Feysul, or of Sheikh Sauleh, have reached me. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee has received from some of the Chiefs of Batinah tenders of allegiance. “ His Highness informs me that Syud Abdool Azeez is expected by the incoming mail steamer from Gwadur, and requested my opinion as to the advisability or otherwise of taking Abdool Azeez into his confidence. Hie question seemed to me to have many pros and cons. The policy of Syud Toorkee lies in a conciliatory bearing towards the tribal Chiefs, and Syud Abdool Azeez is by temperament hasty; on the other hand, His Highness is at present almost without any Chief or Noble of influence or position near his person. His Highness lamented this fact to me, and it was only too evident in the interviews I have had with him. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee purposes moving out of Muscat and proceeding to occupy the forts and territory of Oman in person. This course appears to me judicious. “ Notification has been made to the British subjects dispersed during the recent disturbances that they can now return to Muscat. “His Highness has alluded, in conversation, to the Bunder Abbass lease and other questions. But it seemed to me premature to discuss these matters. “ All being quiet, I have told His Highness of my intention to return to Bushire by the mail steamer, introducing to His Highness Major Way, in whose judgment and integrity His Highness may place every confidence.” 113. Ihe Governor of Bombay and the Hon’ble Mr. Mansfield approved of Colonel Felly’s proceedings, considering he had acted promptly but with caution and judgment.114. The Ilon’ble Mr. Tucker dissented:— “ I cannot concur in this expression of approbation of Colonel Felly’s proceeding's. It appears to me that he ought not to have interfered at all, and that the action he lias taken will, to a certain extent, compromise the character of the British Government, if the agreement with Khulelee has been broken and Khulelee himself treacherously murdered, as seems probable.” The Government of India agreed with the Bombay Government (No. 49, C.P., 18th April 1871). 115. On 19th February Colonel Felly telegraphed :— “ Report of proceedings at Muscat was sent thence direct by Kwangtung on thirteenth; returned to Bushire, and have just received .subjoined telegram from Major Way. February 17th. Syud Toorkee found Khulelee had sent money to Ibrahim bin Gheis to raise force, and that Sheikh Nauser was tampering with tribes in Muscat, and seized Khulelee and son and Sheikh Nauser and threw them into Merani Fort. Khulelee died this morning from, it is said, diarrhoea. All quiet. Telegram ends.” 116. On receipt of the above telegram the Governor, Bombay, thought it necessary to enquire of the Political Resident, if there was any reason to believe that Khulelee died by violence or foul means, as the concurrent deaths of Khulelee and his son seemed a suspicious coincidence. 117. Major Way investigated the matter, taking evidence, and reported— “On the 10 th February, about 7 p.m., His Highness Syud Toorkee sent Sheikh Hashool al Amree and two others to Khulelee with his compliments, and to say he wished to see him. Khulelee at first declined the invitation, but afterwards his son and Sheikh Nauser accompanied the messenger. On landing, they were set upon by the populace and severely beaten and ill-used. They were then conveyed to the Merani Fort. Later in the evening, His Highness Syud Toorkee had an interview with Khulelee, who was brought down from the fort, for he could not walk and appeared quite paralyzed. The next day Khulelee died, and 1 received an intimation from His Highness that he had been like a mad man from the time he was seized, and had died from fright and diarrhoea. “ The next morning, Khulelee’s son died from, I am informed, diarrhoea, from which he had been suffering for some time past. “ Khulelee’s death is a great relief to His Highness Syud Toorkee, inasmuch ^ it is a death-blow to Ibrahim bin Gheis’s cause; it releases His Highness from the engagements he had entered into with him, and which it was almost impossible for him to carry out ; and it removes all fear of his influence, which was very great in the country, being brought to bear against His Highness in any future troubles : and there are several rumours that both Khulelee and his son were made away -with by His Highness’ order, but such rumours are very contra dictory, and the enquiries I have made tend to show that they died from the causes alleged and above shown.” 118. The Bombay Government (No. 1298, dated 29th March 1871) thought it a matter of congratulation that Government was not committed by an acknowledgment of Syud Azan, and advised that formal relations should be entered into with Syud Toorkee as Sultan of Muscat. The Hon’ble Mr. Tucker dissented :— “ I should have fully concurred in the proposal for the immediate recognition of His High ness Syud Toorkee, and for the grant to him of pecuniary aid, if it had not been for the news received by the telegraph of the imprisonment and death of Al Khulelee, who surrendered the forts at Muscat to His Highness Syud Toorkee under an agreement attested by the si&lt;»-natures of Colonel Felly and Major Way. I am of opinion that Syud Toorkee should not be recoo-nized until this matter is cleared up. “ I cannot say that I feel satisfied from the inquiry that has been made that Al Khulelee and his son died from natural causes only, and it appears to me that it would be prudent to avoid any expression of opinion on this subject until further events become known to us. I consider that what has taken place shows clearly that Colonel Felly’s mediation between Svud loorkee and Al Khulelee was unwise and impolitic, and should be censured instead of approved 119. On the 17th March Major Way telegraphed :— “ Syud Toorkee represents inhabitants of Sohar and dependencies daily complain of beintr oppressed and pillaged, and urge him to send at once and take possession; and solicits permission to send a deputy and fifty armed men by sea. -He urges to send by sea would save delav and an expense which he cannot afford; that there will be no opposition and fighting, and the nlumW- ing now going on would be stopped; and that this opportunity, if lost, may not recur. I&gt;-0 (O ( 35 ) respectfully submit possession of Sohar would tend greatly to bring about the early settlement of the country so desirable to State and trade. Early reply by boat solicited”— and the Bombay Government answered (No. 1275, dated 20 th March):— “ Pending the instructions of the Government of India, the position of Syud Toorkee seems to be the same as that of Syud Azan before Syud Toorkee landed, and your instructions are the same. The de facto Ruler should be at liberty to send reinforcements and ammunitions of war to its fortresses.” Major Way had previously cautioned British subjects as to the risk they might run by remaining on the Batinah Coast owing to the unsettled state of the coast line. On 20 th May the Bombay Government were told— “ there need be no restriction on Syud Toorkee's desire to send men by sea along coast to take possession of Sohar. Instructions on other points hereafter.” 120. Colonel Belly telegraphed from Bushire, dated 23rd March— “ Major Way reports having visited Batinah Coast, which being somewhat disturbed, he cautioned our subjects to leave. Major Way found the white flag still flying at Sohar Fort, also Azan’s brother in Batinah, but not in force. Syud Abdool Azeez had arrived at Muscat. Sheik Sala said to have tendered allegiance improbable. We shall not have an accurate account of affairs until Syud Toorkee moves through the country.” With regard to the truth of a rumour that Toorkee was paralysed, Colonel Belly reported that he had recovered from illness, but still suffered from weak ness in the right leg. 121 . On 3rd May Colonel Belly telegraphed :— “Clyde arrived at Jask with telegram from Commander of Bullfinch, reporting sudden death of Major Way on 1st May. Commander had taken charge, pending instructions.. I would sug gest that Major Ross proceed to Muscat by mail steamer, passing Gwadur on Friday. If Clyde, Hugh Bose, and Bullfinch be not all required in Gulf of Oman, I would suggest that Clyde come on to Bushire, as I have no vessel in Persian Gulf, whether for police and ordinary duties, or for carrying out instructions contained in your telegram of 13th April.” 122 . Major Way’s death, which occurred from the discharge of a gun which he had taken up on the morning of the 1 st of May, caused deep and universal sorrow in Muscat. The sad accident not having been witnessed by any person, the circumstances attending it remain unexplained. All classes endeavoured to show the respect and esteem they felt for Major Way. The Government of His Highness Syud Toorkee was represented at the funeral by Syud Saeed, Governor of Muscat, and a general mourning was ordered in Muscat. 123. The news-reports of 22nd April 1871 shewed :— “ Muscat .—The country under the rule of His Highness Syud Toorkee seems to be quiet. “ Sohar and Rostak still disturbed. Ibrahim bin Gheis said to be at Sohar, and desirous of peace with Syud Toorkee. “ Sheik Sala said to be restless and intriguing. o o “ Properties confiscated by Azaif s Government are being returned to original owners. “ Trade increasing. “ Small-pox has broken out in the town. “ Syud Toorkee said to be preparing to move on Sohar. “Gharebee has proposed to visit Syud Toorkee, but has not been accepted. He is consi dered inimical. “ Merchant of Muscat subscribing funds in aid of Syud Toorkee ; it is supposed 5 000 dollars will be collected.” ’ 124. The despatch No. 27 of 23rd May 1871, to Secretary of State, ran “ In continuation of our Secret despatch No. 13, dated 3rd April, we have the honor to forward further papers, as per annexed Abstract of Contents, from which Her Majesty's Government will learn that the following questions, connected with the accession of Syud Toorkee to power in Muscat, have come before us* for consideration :— I-—“ M hether Syud Toorkee should now be recognized by the British Government.( 36 ) II “What answer should he given to his request for the intervention of the British Government to procure for him the lease of Bunder Abbass. III. —“ The payment of the Zanzibar subsidy. IV. “ His request for permission to send 50 armed men to Sohar by sea for the purpose of taking possession of it.” “ In the 8 th paragraph of our despatch of the 3rd April, wc have expressed our opinion in favor of recognizing Syud Toorkee, and this we propose to do as soon as we iccei\e an expies- sion of Your Grace’s views.” (See Chapter on Bunder Abhass and Zanzibar precis.) 125. On 4th June 1871, the Viceroy telegraphed to the Secretary of “ Our despatch, 3rd April, No. 13. I propose to recognize Syud Toorkee at Muscat. Do you agree ? ” 126. This step was taken on receipt of a demi-official note from the Poli tical Secretary, Bombay:— “ With reference to the question of Syud Toorkee’s recognition, His Excellency the Governor has asked me to send you the following extract from a demi-official note from Major Ross, who was sent to Muscat to take the place of the late Major-Way “ f I was civilly received by the Arab authorities. All seems going on w r ell, and there is no competition for favor as yet. ' If Government would recognise Toorkee, I think we might confidently look forward to quiet times, but the Arabs attach considerable meaning to non recognition ; it is a sort of invitation, according to their lights, to every one who has a pretence to come into the field. f Toorkee has been thinking of sending a deputation to Government. The Governor here asked my opinion and advised him not to do so.’ “This note is dated Muscat, 11th of May.” 127. The Secretary of State agreed to the recognition of Syud Toorkee by telegram, dated 9th June 1871. 128. The “ News-Reports ” forwarded by Bombay Government, No. 2399, 6 th June 1871, stated:— “ On the 17th May salutes were fired from the Muscat forts for the alleged capture of Sohar by the troops of His Highness Syud Toorkee, but it turned out that the news was incorrect. A body of His Highness’ forces had invested Sohar, but had not succeeded in taking it. Syud^ Toorkee, changing his original intention of proceeding along the Batinah Coast with the main body of his forces, returned on the 22nd to. Muscat. A force has been left to watch Sohar, which is still in possession of Ibrahim bin Gheis. Feysul bin Hamood is dangerously ill at Rostak from pleurisy. “ The frontier post of Beraymee has been suffered to fall into the bands of a small body of Wahabees by the Naeem tribe, who were fighting amongst themselves. “ The following members of the Al-boo-Saeed family have recently arrived from Zanzibar ; Hilal bin Mahomed, Nasr bin Thow r eynee (lately of Gwadur), and Hareb bin Thow r eynee. The Sultan of Zanzibar has sent a small amount of pecuniary aid to His Highness Syud Toorkee. “ On the 24th May, the Queen’s Birthday, His Highness Syud Toorkee ordered a British Hag to be hoisted on Fort Jalalee, and a salute of 21 guns was fired.” 129. On 12th June, Bombay Government telegraphed:— “ Following telegrams from Pelly : f A letter from Syud Toorkee. Is earnest in hoping he may be recognised as ruler of Oman.’ Telegram ends. Major Ross reports Sohar still in hands of Ibrahim bin Gheis; dissensions between Henavees and Ghaferees said to have frustrated Syud Toorkee’s plans. Saleh intriguing. Abdool Azeez discontented; Syud Toorkee still sanguine of success. Major Ross thinks recognition of Toorkee would give him moral support. Our Agents on Arab coast and at Lingah report all quiet dow r n to 29th May and 6 th June respec tively. Telegram ends. A boat arrived from Kuteef states Turkish troops have occupied that fort.” 130. The recognition of Syud Toorkee as Ruler of Muscat was commu nicated to Bombay Government (No. 1238P., 16th June 1871):— “ I am to request that the Political Agent at Muscat may be instructed, through the Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform His Highness that it gives 11 is Ekcellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council much pleasure to recognise him as the Ruler ofIS ( 37 ) Muscat, and to continue with him the same relations of friendship that existed in the days of Syud Saeed; and that His Excellency in Council trusts that the contentions which have so lono- distracted Oman may speedily be brought to a close, and peace and prosperity restored to His Highness' dominions. “Orders have been issued for the Lynx to proceed to Muscat, and it is the wish of His Excellency in Council, that the Officer Commanding may be instructed to arrange with the Political Agent for a salute to be fired in honor of His Highness Syud Toorkee on the occasion of his recognition. “ With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 2382, dated 5th June, I am to request that the Political Agent will be careful to make no reference to the former dependencies of Muscat on the Mekran Coast, or to Bunder Abbass, or to the Zanzibar subsidy. No orders on these subjects can be passed till the views of Her Majesty's Government are received, and till a reply is received from you to my confidential letter No. 985 P., dated 23rd May, regarding the Zanzibar subsidy. Should His Highness refer to any of these subjects in conversation with the Political Agent, or otherwise, the Political Agent should merely answer that he has not yet received any instructions from his Government on these points. He will at the same time, however, receive and forward any representations which Syud Toorkee may make respecting them.' 131. The News-Report of lOth June stated :— “ His Highness Syud Toorkee is residing at Muscat. The situation as regards Sohar is unchanged. A body of Syud Toorkee's troops continues to besiege that place which is still in the hands of Ibrahim bin Gheis. “ The murder of Syed Mahomed bin Saeed, Governor of Semayal, by certain of the tribe Beni Rooaheb is reported. Agents have proceeded from Muscat to make investigation. Other parts of Oman are at present tranquil.' 132. On 11 th June Major Ross, Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphed:— “ Bin Syf with 1,500 men besieging Sohar, Ibrahim still holding out. Abdool Azeez proceeds there.' 133. On 24th June the new s was:— “The Agents despatched by His Highness Syud Toorkee to inquire into the circumstances of the murder of Mahomed bin Saeed, Governor of Semayel, have returned and report that only very few persons of the Rooaheb tribe were concerned in the deed. The Chief and majority of that tribe are well affected towards the present Government, and the district is quiet. “ The siege of Sohar is continued. The garrison is not numerous, and consists partly of Persian settlers; but the strength of the place enables it to hold out. Syud Hareb bin Thoweynee and Syud Ahmed bin el Imam have been sent by His Highness to endeavour to push on the operations. Other parts of Oman continue tranquil.' 134. In May 1871 Syed Toorkee issued an anti-slavery proclamation:— “ To all whom it may concern. “ The owners or masters of all vessels which shall arrive in any part of our possessions with slaves imported for sale shall be liable to punishment, and we order such vessels to be burnt on the facts being established ; any person concerned in landing slaves as aforesaid shall be punished. No person permitted to traffic with such vessels, and whoever shall aid them, conceal their affairs, or land slaves in any place, shall be punished by us.' 135. Major Ross on 27th June reported By telegram:— “Abdool Azeez declined Sohar command. Proceeds to-day to Gwadur. Situation gener ally unchanged.' On w hich Colonel Felly w rote :— “ The departure of Syud Abdool Azeez for Gwadur will relieve His Highness Syud Toorkee of the presence of a restless relative at Muscat. “ The jealousies between the great tribal divisions of Henavee and Ghafferee were to be expected, and will probably continue at intervals, be the Sultan who he may. “ The straitened financial position of His Highness is, perhaps, the most pressing difficulty. “ There can be no doubt that His Highness is very desirous that his authority should be recognized by us, and this recognition would in many ways strengthen his position.' 136. Ou 10th July Major Ross reported the embarkation of Syud Toorkee again for the Batinah Coast to operate against Ibrahim. K( 38 ) On 30th July 1871 Colonel Polly telegraphed “ Lynx had proceeded to Bombay before I received Government of India’s instructions concerning recognition. Bullfinch now proceeds to Muscat, instead of lynx, and will alter- wards return to Gulf.” 137. On 6 th August 1871 the latest intelligence was “ His Highness Syud Toorkee started in his ship the Rehmanee for the port of Shmas, lately taken from Syud Ibrahim bin Gheis. On arrival there, His Highness arranged for bodies of his adherents to 'join him before Sohar, and sailed himself for Hormool. In the meanwhile Rashid bin Maktoom, a Chief of the Beni Yas, had landed at the latter place with about 70 men, acting in concert with His Highness. About five miles inland is the fort of Lawa, which was held by Mahomed bin Saeed, of the El Hina tribe, for. Ibrahim bin Gheis. i bis Chief sallied out and encountered Rashid, but was killed and his followers were defeated. His Highness soon after arrived and took possession of Lawa. “ Thence His Highness proceeded to Sohar, which he besieged and erected a battery of three guns. « An engagement also occurred in Khadra of Batineh, between the tribes ^ al-boo-RasKeyd and Yal-boo-Sad, resulting in the defeat of the latter, who favored Syud Ibrahim. “ A breach was made in the walls of Sohar, and all was ready for the assault when some of His Highness* adherents interceded and proposed terms of compromise, which were granted by Syud Toorkee. Under this arrangement Syud Ibrahim retains Sohar and the Coast line from' Sullan to El Khabooreh, the remaining districts and ports, including Suweyk and Musnah, being delivered up to His Highness. “ Syud Toorkee arrived in Muscat this morning.** 138. On 8 th August 1871 Colonel Felly telegraphed :— « Major Ross telegraphs that Toorkee has made terms with Ibrahim, the latter keeping Sohar and Toorkee receiving Survevk and Musnah. I do not think this altogether sal islactoiv. Bullfinch and Toorkee had arrived at Muscat.** Colonel Felly (No. 892-231, dated 14th August 1871) commented thus :— “ If this be a final arrangement, and Ibrahim hold that strong fortress as an independent command, I cannot think the settlement advantageous for His Highness* interests as Ruler of Oman. “ It may be that His Highness Syud Toorkee having heard of the intention of the British Government to recognise him as Ruler may have been anxious to return to his capital in view to meeting the Political Agent, and that His Highness has, therefore, made such temporary settlement at Sohar as was practicable on the spur of the moment.** The Bombay Government requested Colonel Felly to endeavour to ascer tain the exact circumstances of the truce made between Syud Toorkee and Ibrahim. 139. Major Ross’s No. 468, dated 10th August 1871, to Colonel Felly summarised the occurrence and the arrangements :—- “ It appears that there was every prospect of an assault resulting in the capture of Sohar, when some of His Highness* followers of the tribe Yal-boo-Rasheyd persuaded him to stay his hand and make peace. The terms are that Ibrahim shall hold Sohar and the portion of coast from Sullan to Khabooreh, a tract of some 30 miles, all other parts of the Batinah being made over to Syud Toorkee. “ An Arabic document, probably the composition of Thoweynee bin Mahomed, His High ness* Minister, explains in some measure the^vasons which influenced Syud Toorkee*s decision in this matter. 1 have no doubt that, as hinted, His Highness considered that a portion of his adherents would, in the event of his refusing compliance with their request for a peace, have deserted and, perhaps, aided the opposite party. This would have prolonged operation, and His Highness* want of funds would have prevented his keeping his forces together for any length of time. He has thus been forced by circumstances, I apprehend, into an arrangement distasteful to him. It cannot, therefore, be considered a permanent settlement, as the first favorable opportunity will, doubtless, be taken to renew the struggle for Sohar. This is evident from the expressions used in the latter part of the documefit. f&lt; The forts of Soweik and Musnah have been delivered to His Highness, who returned to Muscat on the 6 th instant. ^ At present the situation is much as follows:—His Highness the Sultan has possession of the sea-board with the exception of about 30 miles of coast, and in the interior no opposi tion to His Highness of any importance has been organised. It is to be remarked that the adherents on whom the Government of His Highness mainly relies at present are tribes of the( 39 ) V IT Gliaferee division, the Ilenavee tribes, mostly the co-religionists and former supporters of the Alboo Sandee family, being, it is considered, in general lukewarn, in some cases showing signs of disaffection. The elation of the Ghafireeyeh will naturally be accompanied by proportional discontent of the Henaveeyeh. The tribes and their Chiefs have, during many years of contention, learnt to prize their power in setting up and putting down Rulers at will, and, probably, will not find their advantage in supporting any one Ruler to consolidated and undivided supremacy. It is not, therefore, to be supposed that His Highness Syud Toorkee will be exempt from the difficulties which have beset every Ruler of Oman. \\ ith command of an adequate income, the Government of His Highness is now in the position to repress any attempts at disorder and establish itself durably. You are aware how embarrassed His High ness is in a pecuniary point of view, and the Sohar affair is a good instance of the consequences.” 140. Colonel Pelly replied to Major Ross:— “The idea of apportioning the Muscat territories between the representatives of the Syud Saeed branch and those of the Bin Gheis branch of the ruling family has been frequently mooted by the Arabs themselves. In old times, this partition of territory actually obtained. And at the time of British intervention in 1860, His Highness Syud Toorkee ruled Sohar, wliile his brother Thoweynee ruled Muscat. “ But the arbitrament of the late Earl Canning held it to be unadvisable that Sohar should continue independent of Muscat. “In my opinion Syud Toorkee will always be liable to find the peace and prosperity of his dominions disturbed so long as the representative of a rival family branch rules independently over the strongholds and region now resigned to Ibrahim bin Gheis. But, of course, the question is one of domestic policy, and all we can do is to watch events.” 141. Up to 14th August the Bushire News-Report announced— “ Great mortality by cholera occurred at Bushire during the first two weeks of August last, since which time the disease had somewhat abated. According to medical opinion, the insalu brity of the place was in a great measure owing to the flooded condition of the plain in its vicinity. Cholera prevalent at Lingah and along the coast line the Congoon and in the interior, as also in the islands of Bahrein. The villages of Sittreh, Bedeeyeh, and Jaffair, and some of those in Guttur, still infected with this disease. “ The peace at sea continued undisturbed, and pearl fishery was expected to yield a very handsome return this year.” 142. On 20th August the News Report continued :— “ Syud Toorkee having returned from the Batinah Coast was made acquainted, on the 8 th August, with his formal recognition as Ruler of Muscat by the British Government. His Highness received with due ceremony the Political Agent accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer and officers of the Bullfinch and the Constance, as well as other Engish residents. After congratulations a Royal salute was fired from the Bullfinch. The day was observed as a holiday, and the vessels in harbour were dressed. His Highness entertained his European visitors at breakfast and received congratulatory visits from deputations of the various* classes. Syud Toorkee’s recognition is regarded as of special interest and importance for the people of Oman, and the general expectation is that it will mark the inauguration of a more peaceful era. “ Suweyk and Mesnaeh Forts have been given up to His Highness. No disturbances at Muscat.” The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council concurred in the approval expressed by the Bombay Government of the Political Agent’s proceedings on the occasion (No. 2745P., dated 22nd December 1871). 143. Major Ross wrote on 25th August (No. 504):— ♦ “ I do not consider that there is at present danger of a reorganization of the party of the late Government. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee is now acknowledged in almost all of the places which recognized the authority of his late brother, Syud Thoweynee, the exceptions being Sohar and Rostack, and attached to Sohar the fort of Hebi. It is not new to find Sohar temporarily separated from Muscat, but its being so is, I am deferentially of opinion, very injurious to the M uscat State and must inevitably be the source of recurring disturbances. “ It is difficult to judge of the extent and nature of His Highness the Sultan’s real power over the various interior districts, because it has yet to be tried. 1 do not myself think that more is possible, or will be attempted, than the mild feudal system of former times.” 144. On 15th September 1871 Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Bombay:— “ Syud Poorkee wishes to send vessel to Kassad to enforce his authority. Please instruct me whether Government would object.”r ( 40 ) 145. The Secretary noted &lt;f An account of Kassad will be found at pajre 53/ of the 1 olume of 1 ersian Selections. It is a dependency of Muscat, but lies well within the Persian Gulf. In our despatch of 3rd April last, No. 13, in which we advocated a withdrawal from interference in the Sea of Oman, we suggested that the Ruler of Muscat should be relieved from the restrictions imposed on warlike operations outside the Persian Gulf. I hat despatch would not, therefoie, apph to the present case. The answer to be given therefore depends on the policy we mean to maintain m the (xiilf. The recent Turkish expedition has raised very important questions aftecting that policy. “Muscat, for example, has just as much right to send troops by sea to Kassad to establish his authoritv there as the Turks have to send a naval expedition to Kateef to establish their authority at Nejd. We have permitted the Turks to send their troops by sea. Are we prepared to object to Muscat doing the same, and, if so, why t “ As it appears possible to reach Kassad by landing on the east side of the promontory of Has el Khyma, and then marching inland, l think the answer to Toorkee might be that no objections will be raised, provided the vessels do not enter the Gulf or go beyond Mussendorn.” 14G. It was answered (No. 2013P., dated 22nd September 1871)— “ Viceroy cannot object to Toorkee sending vessel to Kassad, provided it doe* not go out side territorial limits ot three miles irom shore. It is understood here that Kassad is unde i Muscat, and can be reached by vessel as above. If not, telegraph. 147. On the 18th September Colonel Pelly telegraphed “Captain Miles reports Abdool Azeez started for Charbar with 150 Kinds and other followers. Believes he will proceed westwards and, perhaps, join Ibrahim bin Gheis at Sohar. Major Ross unsatisfied with state of affairs in Oman. Abdool Azeez relinquished his project by the 23rd September and returned to Gwadur. He was met by Mahomed Ali at Kilah and persuaded by him to return. Colonel Pelly was told to enquire from Syud Toorkee whether he was apprehensive of any danger from his brother, and to inform him ot what he heard of Abdool Azeez’s movement. 148. The News Report of 23rd September related— “ The Turkish Steam Corvette Lebanon and Steam-ship Iskenderia, 16 and 8 guns respectively, arrived at Bushire under the command of Aarif Beg, Commodore of the Sublime Porte, who gave out that these two vessels were the vanguard of a fleet often set apart for duty in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. A Royal salute was fired by the vessels after anchoring in the Bushire inner roads. The salute was returned after a short interval by the Persian Artillery. The Commodore, Aarif Beg, then landed and called on the Deputy Governor, who had previously sent a deputation to wait on him.” 149. On 6 th October 1871 Colorfel Pelly telegraphed— “ Major Ross telegraphs renewed hostilities between Sultan and Ibrahim imminent. Col lision between parties already occurred at Stayath. I propose proceeding to Muscat by mail steamer to-morrow. If Lynx could join me at Muscat on way up advisable. I think our utmost moral endeavours should be given to prevent another exhibition of upsetting rule in Muscat.” The Government of India telegraphed to Bombay (No. 2151P., dated 7th October 1871):— Authorize Colonel Pelly to proceed to Muscat and use all legitimate means short of actual interference to prevent renewed hostilities with Ibrahim. Lynx will be ordered to join him.” Instructions had already been sent to Lynx to meet Colonel Pelly at Muscat. 150. Colonel Pelly (No. 1186-335, dated 13th October 1871) reported at length:— “ On the morning of the 8 th I embarked on board the mail steamer and arrived at Muscat last night. “After the conclusion of the truce between His Highness and Syud Ibrahim bin Gheis, reported on in my letter now marginally noted, matters continued in statu quo during some weeks. “ Subsequently Ibrahim bin Gheis, having some family business at Hazam, proceeded thither from Sohar. No. 970-250, dated 28tli August 1871, and accompaniment from Political Agent, Muscat, No. 468, dated 10th August 1871. l K. i m ( ■( 41 ) f ♦ “ His Hig’hness hearing of this march, either bond fide deemed it to be in the nature of a strategical combination between Ibrahim and the Rostack Chief, or else inferred that the move, however occasioned, afforded him (His Highness) a favourable opportunity for occupying the Sohar Fort. On reaching, however, the intermediate Fort of Burkah, His Highness seems to have become aware that a surprise of Sohar was impracticable. “ His Highness then made a demonstration against Hazam, which failed of success, and His Highness re-embarking returned to Muscat, where he now remains, and without (as it is stated) entertaining any present intention of renewing hostilities. “ In so far as I am informed, Ibrahim bin Gheis entertains no present intention of attempt ing any thing against Muscat. His views (which are probably shared among many Arabs) seem to be limited to a return to that posture of affairs under which in older times Sohar and other northern districts were held under a branch of the Royal tribe, or by a Governor, separate from, and independent of, the Ruler at Muscat.” 151. On 15th October the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed:— “ Captain Miles reports from Gwadur. ‘Ahdool Azeez has again left for Charbar with 20 followers. Has been promised assistance by Hossein Khan of Gaih.* ” His real intention was believed to be to join Ibrahim, who was reported to be in open revolt at Sohar. Syud Toorkee arrived at Charbar from Muscat. 152. On the 28th October (No. 12L3-346)'Colonel Pelly wrote again— “ Referring to Ibrahim bin Gheis at Sohar, and his relative Fysul at Rostack, I asked His Highness whether he deemed their object to be the retention of their present independent positions, or aggression towards Muscat. His Highness replied —‘ Ibrahim wishes to turn me out, just as I wish to turn him out. But/ continued His Highness, ‘ Ibrahim is without money, and when his provisions are exhausted I may be able to do something. Meantime, 1 do not fear his proceedings so much as I do those of Syud Abdool Azeez. Moreover/ added His Highness, ‘ I purpose shortly sending my ship to Khabooreh, when I may be able to gain possession of that place, and so threaten Ibrahim.’ “ His Highness voluntarily explained to the interpreter that he was extremely unsatisfied with Thoweynee, and would gladly be rid of him if he could. And there is, 1 think, no doubt that the position of Thoweynee has done as much as, or perhaps more than, any other circum stance to alienate the Chiefs, in particular those of His Highness’ hereditary supporters, the Henavee tribes, from His Highness’ cause. In brief, I have heard but one opinion expressed concerning this man, viz., that his present position is in all respects injurious and dangerous to His Highness’ prospects. “ At the same time, this question of domestic and even personal policy has seemed to Major Ross and myself to be one in which we could not interfere or even advise. Nor do I feel sure that in advising we should benefit His Highness in his actual circumstances. “ It is well that all aspirants to power, and all their subordinate intriguers, seem to be almost, or quite, as destitute of funds as His Highness, and may from this cause be unable to carry into successful effect any serious or, at least, immediate conspiracy. It may be hoped also that the recent recognition of His Highness by Government, followed by my arrival here with Her Majesty’s Ships Magpie and Hugh Rose, may aiford His Highness all the support of which moral influences may be capable.” 153. On 4th November the news was— “ Her Majesty’s Steam Ship Lgnx, Royal Navy, arrived at Bushire from a cruise on the 27th October. She brought the melancholy intelligence of the death at sea, from fever, of Major Sydney Armstead Smith, Bombay Staff Corps, Her Britannic Majesty’s Acting 1st Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the morning of the 26th.” On 10th November it was reported— “ Tranquillity has continued in Oman since the date of last report. “ The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, arrived from Gwadur on 6 th instant, and proceeded to the Gulf in Her Majesty’s Steamer Magpie 'on the following day. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee purposes visiting the Batinah Coast in his ship-of-war, the Rahmanee. “ Fevers are very prevalent.” On the 24th November the news continued— “ His Highness Syud Toorkee, having embarked in his corvette, the Rahmanee, proceeded on the 23rd instant to visit the Batinah Coast. Syud Hareb bin Thoweynee has gone to Kishm to pay a visit to his brother Syud Salem. “ Fevers continue to be very prevalent.” # Lr ( 42 ) 154. The Bushire news on 2nd December was— “ Ahmed Nedeem Effendi, Turkish Consul for Bushire, arrived here per British Indian Steam Navigation Steamer India on the 19th November last. “ A party of sixteen Turkish soldiers, under command of a Non-Commissioned Officer, arrived at Bushire on the 28th November, and is supposed to be a guard for the Turkish Consulate.” 155. On 8 th December 1871 it was reported— “ His Highness Syud Toorkee having proceeded in his ship-of-war, the Rafmanee, to Khabooreh on the Batinah Coast, that place, which had previously been held for Ibrahim bin Gheis, was surrendered to His Highness by the El Howasineh. “ His Highness returned to Muscat on the 30th November.” On 22nd December 1871 the news was that Syud Toorkee had been to Bushire on the Rahmanee and returned to Muscat on the 18th. 156. On the 3rd January 1872 the Bombay Government telegraphed— “ Colonel Felly telegraphs to-day, 29th December. Imprisonment of six British Indian sub jects at Sohar by Ibrahim bin Gheis for refusing demand for money contributions. Subjects were long ago warned of risk they incurred in remaining at Sohar at present. Sultan wiites com plaining of intrigues and intention of Syud Salim. Senior Naval Officer promises to anange foi a ship proceeding to Muscat Coast and give moral support.” No orders were issued. The Bombay Government (No. 645, 31st January 1872) letter continued the correspondence on this matter. Major Boss submitted a letter trom Hindoos residing at Sohar, asking for rescue from imprisonment trom British Govern ment. Major Boss added, 25th December— c&lt; The traders who returned to Sohar on the conclusion of terms of truce between His High ness the Sultan and Ibrahim bin Gheis were certainly warned by me that Sohar was under the command of a Chief with whom the British Government had no relations of any sort, and were warned that in returning to Sohar it was on their Own risk. On the 2nd January he wrote that the imprisoned traders were released by Syud Ibrahim on payment of a forced contribution of about one hundred dollars.” 157. On the 10 th January again Colonel Belly telegraphs as follows :— . The New, Report No. 2 of 1872, “I have received subjoined telegram from Major Ross dated 20th January, referred to Mflscat, 6 th. light ‘ occurred near Sohar in which Ibrahim the same matter. beaten with loss. Retains Sohar. General position as before. Toorkee holds Khabooreh. He returned here yesterday.” The letter of the Bombay Government (No. 376, of 20th January 1872) forwarded correspondence from the Political Bcsident, Persian Gulf, relative to the embar rassed condition of Syud Toorkee’s finances, the intrigues of the Ex-Sultan Syud Salem, and the proceedings of Ibrahim bin Gheis with reference to British subjects at Sohar. It contained Colonel Belly’s opinion that it is our duty to afford all lawful protection to British Indian subjects sojourning in the Independent States along the Arab Littoral, though this broad principle must necessarily be qualified in practice. He added (in his letter No. 1328-607, dated 20th Decem ber to Major Boss) — “Aware of the extreme weakness of the Sultan's rule, I refrain from requesting you to urge on His Highness the advisability of reducing the rebellion of Ibrahim bin Gheis. But at the same time we must bear in mind that His Highness is the recognized Ruler of the Muscat territories, and that the British Indian Government will ultimately expect from him that our subjects sojourning within his dominions should be treated in conformity with Treaty, and that if injury be done to them in their persons and property, reparation may ultimately be required.” 158. On the 17th February the Bombay Government telegraphed— “ Following from Colonel Felly:— f Political Agent telegraphs Sultan received reliable information Ex-Sultan Syud Salem meditates descent on Soor with about 100 men, and solicits A aid of steamer. News from Kishm states Syud Salem invited by Henavee tribes left Kishm. P •» Intended going to Soor. Another telegram says Salem gone to Pirate Coast with few servants on invite from Henavees as against Muscat. Bullfinch after visiting Sohar reports Ibrahim bin Gheis proceed to Khabooreh with heavy guns, was to be joined by hillsmen. On Mekran Coast Abdool Azeez said to hold Charbar and be in communication with Ibrahim Khan. I solicit instructions.' ” b *The Gov r ernment of India answered (No. 4231\, 20th February)— “ Colonel Pelly should be told to protect British subjects at Muscat and Soor, and to inform Syud Toorkee that active aid of steamer cannot be given, but that he will not be interfered with in the measures he may wish to take in Gulf of Oman or off Mekran Coast/’ 158. On 22nd February the Bombay Government again— “ Following from Colonel Pelly :— f Have received subjoined telegram from Political Agent, Muscat.—Telegram begins.—Muscat eighteenth. His Highness heard Syud Salem left Hen- jam twelfth. Thinks he will certainly land in south-east, and proceeds in person to-day to Soor in Rahmanee. Trouble anticipated.—Telegram ends. Magpie called at Muscat some days ago, and I have requested Senior Naval Officer to despatch a ship of war to Muscat to give moral support/ ” No orders were issued by the Government of India. 159. Colonel Felly’s (No. 130-28 of 1872, dated 27th January) letter showed that Khabooreh remained in His Highness’ possession. Ibrahim was still moving in the matter. His Highness’ Commander, Bedr bin Seyf, surprised Ibrahim near Sohar, on his way to Khabooreh, and routed him, Ibrahim escaping into Sohar. Syud Toorkee had returned to Muscat and Thoweynee bin Maho med had obtained hold of Khabooreh for Syud Toorkee. In his No. 131-29, of the same date, the Bullfinch was said to be on her way to Sohar to discover the real facts in the case of the confinement of six Banyans in the Sohar Fort by order of Ibrahim. Major Boss reported (No. 25, 13th January 1872) that the six Banyans were confined by order of Ibrahim in a tower of the Sohar fort. On the second day they agreed to supply 25 bags of rice and were released. Major Boss, the Political Agent, also reported that the Khabooreh Fort was in charge of one of His Highness’ adherents. The Government of India awaited for the report. The news report of the 4th February stated that no movements of import ance had •occurred during the past fortnight. The Batinah Coast continuing unsettled. Her Majestys Ship Bullfinch had proceeded to the Persian Gulf. On the 18th February (in No. 1204, dated 28th February 1872 from Bom bay Government) tranquillity was reported to have prevailed in all the provinces of Oman. It was rumoured that Syud Salem bin Thoweynee designed taking the field in the south-east. Her Majesty’s Ship Magpie had left for Bombay on the 13th. It was added— “ His Highness Syud Toorkee is sending an Envoy with a present of horses to his brother Svud Burgash of Zanzibar/’ On the 29th February the Bombay Government (No. 1249) forwarded a letter from the Political Agent at Muscat, dated 4th October 1871, regarding certain expressions alleged to have been used by the Turkish Commodore con cerning His Highness Syud Toorkee. The Turkish Commodore complained of the Sultan conversing with the Hutch Consul in the house of one Hajee Abdool Nubbee. The grounds of complaint being— \st. —That no Pilot was furnished at Muscat. Znd .—That His Highness did not depute any one to welcome the Turkish Commodore on board his vessel. Zrd. —That His Highness was wanting in hospitality and friendliness. Colonel Pelly reported that there was one opinion among the natives of those regions, viz., that the Turks are desirous of availing themselves of every opportunity for interfering in Arabian affairs and exerting direct control over Arabian territory. The Bombay Government directed Colonel Pelly to instruct Major Boss to take an opportunity of mentioning to His Highness Syud Toorkee the advisability in his position of treating the officers of the Porte with courtesy on such occasions.r ( 44 ) 159A. On the 24th February the Bombay Government again telegraphed— “ Following from Colonel Felly : Atiior Ross teleoraphs as follows: Muscat Jilst, Syud Salem at Sohai, arranging plans with Ibrahim. Suppose he will proceed to Soor. Syud Toorkee proceeds to Gwadur instead of to Soor.” Accordingly on 1st March Colonel Felly was asked by telegram to telegraph his views of the present situation in Muscat. Colonel Felly replied on 2nd March “ Ross’s letters received to-day state Sultan has cause to apprehend danger or treachery from every side, and that his popularity and reputation are undermined by baneful influence of his Minister. 5 Present combination in Oman is probably led by Ibrahim bin Gheis northward, Syud Salem southward, and Sheik Sauleh inland. Sultan meantime seems intending move on Mekran Coast, Among the present difficulties of Sultan is his utter want of money. The present situation will probably develop itself within a short period, and meantime no course would need to be consistent with our policy other than to watch events and protect British interests. Senior Naval officer has promised to despatch a man-of-war to Muscat where she should be near arriving now.” In forwarding this the Bombay Government added « j n m y opinion the injury to British interests, political and commercial, which will result from this recurrence of disorder in Oman, and the possible establishment of an unfriendly power there, can scarcely be exaggerated. The present condition of affairs is mainly the result of the Sultan’s want of means partly caused and certainly greatly increased by the withdrawal of the Zanzibar subsidy. On the accession of Syud Burgash the slightest intimation of our wish would have secured its payment in future and of all arrears. 1 have more than once urged that he should receive pecuniary assistance pending the settlement of this question. 1 am afraid that it is now possibly too late, and that we shall see the flag of the Forte flying over Muscat.” His Excellency’s order was— « Nothing to be said at present. Let events develop themselves. Turks have disclaimed intentions against Muscat.” 159B. The Bombay Government wrote (No. 1161, dated 26th February 1872) that though they did not think that there was any prospect of Syud Salem being successful in any attempt he might make on Muscat, these continual intrigues against the Sultan’s Government were most mischievous as giving a feeling of insecurity and tending to keep alive a feeling of opposition, which otherwise might subside. As long, however, as the present want of money on the part of Syud Toorkee continued, the Bombay Government feared that we could hope for no improvement, and earnestly pressed on the Government of India looking to the advantage that it would be to us to have a strong Govern ment in Oman, the necessity of affording the Sultan some assistance in his pre sent difficulties. The Government of India answered (No. 590F., dated 11th March 1872):— “ His Excellency in Council is quite alive to the advantages that would be gained by the establishment of a firm and just Government in Muscat, as well as in all other countries with which the British Government is in friendly alliance. His Excellency in Council would also o-ladly see the Muscat throne perpetuated in that family with which the British Government has had such intimate relations since the beginning of the present century. To secure results so desirable the Government of India is willing to exert all the moral influence at its command. But to go further than this His Excellency in Council considers would be a departure from the line of policy hitherto pursued in dealing with the affairs of Oman, and His Excellency in Council is not at present prepared to sanction expenditure from Indian revenues in assisting Syud Toorkee to maintain his position. His Excellency in Council however, in view of the pecuniary difficulties from which Syud Toorkee is suffering, will again lay before the Secretary of State an expression of his opinion that the arrangements by which Muscat was to receive an annual subsidy of 40,000 dollars from Zanzibar should be maintained, and will strongly urge an early decision of the question.” On the 6 th March the Bombay Government telegraphed :— “ Colonel Felly telegraphs. I have received the subjoined from Muscat. Political Agent, Muscat, 28th, Syud Toorkee reached Soor 23rd ; Salim escaped to Jaalan. No rising yet reported, and again Muscat, 3rd—Syud Toorkee returned 29th. Salem in Jaalan. Reception considered unfavourable Lynx here.” I * £CHAPTER VII.— (Sections 160-172.) SINKING OF A MUSCAT VESSEL BY HER MAJESTY’S SHIP “ QUANTUNG. ” (Foi- the question of the maritime peace raised again in this case see Chapter on that sub ject as well.) 160. The Bombay Government (No. 766 of February 23rd, 1871) reported full particulars. It was done by order of the— “ Political Agent at Muscat acting under the following instructions of the Bombay Govern ment communicated to him by the Resident on the 10 th of January.” “ The permission to Muscat Government to reinforce garrison on coast by sea cannot be continued now that a state of war exists in Muscat territory, as we should then abandon our neutral position between the combatants. All military«operations by sea must be prevented.” “ After having secured the safety of British subjects by sending them afloat, the Poli tical Agent, on the 19th of January, communicated the above order to Syud Azan, who replied on the 22nd that it was utterly impossible for him to agree to it. On the following day, the Political Agent, learning that Syud Azan intended to send some reinforcements with a field-piece, ammunition, and equipments complete by sea to Mutthra, wrote to His Highness that if he intended to send those reinforcements contrary to the orders of Government, their passage would be stopped. In spite of this intimation, a boat containing the piece of Artillery with equipments left the quay, and was stopped by a boat from Her Majesty’s Steamer Quantung, and warned to return, which she did. After a little while the Political Agent received a letter from Syud Azan, saying that he could not comply with the orders of Government. The boat again put off with some Persian Artillerymen on board, but on being repeatedly warned she ran into the south of the outer Fort where the Artillerymen landed. Shortly afterwards, she put to sea for the third time, accompanied by another boat, containing some armed men, when the Quantung got out of the harbour and running direct for the boat with the gun struck her in midship and sunk her. The ciw escaped by throwing themselves over board and swimming ashore. The next day, Syud Azan addressed a letter to the Political Agent, apologizing for what he had done. The proceedings of the Political Agent w^ere approved by the Bombay Government. 161. The Foreign Secretary noted on the case— “ Major Way’s proceedings were certainly ‘ energetic/ but scarcely ‘judicious’ or likely to meet with the approval of Ills Excellency in Council. “ In the instance under reference, Syud Azan w'as de facto Ruler of Muscat. The fort of Mutthra and the unbroken line of coast between Muscat and Mutthra w r ere also in his possession. The boat that was sunk appears never to have left what is constructively Muscat territory. Every condition, therefore, required under the Government orders of the 4 th August 1869, w'as fulfilled, and under those orders the boat ought not to have been interfered with. “ This is only another instance of the indefensible and dangerous character of the policy we have lately pursued in the Gulf of Oman, a policy which has its origin in the events of 1868. It is founded on no law or engagement with Muscat; on nothing but t}ie wall of the stronger. Our will and pleasure is perhaps as good a foundation on which to rest it as any other, if'the policy be in itself an expedient one, and the circumstances of the case justify it. In a separate note on the maritime peace however, I have.endeavoured to show that the policy is positively a dangerous one, unjust to Muscat, and incapable of defence, if challenged by other powers. As regards ourselves there is no advantage resulting from it, and I cannot understand why it should be persisted in. J “ Tu the Persian Gulf, the case is totally different. Not only is the policy in that Sea justi fied in the case of some tribes by Treaty and in respect to all by long usage ; but a departure from it would be dangerous to the general peace of the Gulf and injurious to the rights and interests of our own subjects. For instance, the southern shores of the Persian Gulf are occupied by numerous warlike Arab tribes, who own no central authority and are always at war among themselves. The coast is studded with islands where our subjects have invested large sums in the pearl trade. Hostilities at sea entirely stop that trade and ruin our subjects. It was also found that, undei pretext of lawful war by sea, the Arabs plundered our traders and committed piracy and all kinds of outrage. Temporary measures of remedy were tried, but it was found impos sible to distinguish, in dealing with such barbarous races, between acts of lawful war andpiracies committed under cover of war, and that the only means of securing 1 peace and the safety of commerce was to prohibit absolutely all warlike operations by sea. there is an intelli gible and defensible ground for the policy in the Persian Gulf, not so in the sea of Oman. The coast of Oman is all under the undivided Government of Muscat. There are no pearl banks on the coast, on which our subjects settle. Our trade is with the seaport towns, as in other country. The outlying possessions of ]\fusc*at aie separated fiom Oman by many miles of sea. War in that Guff is no more concern of ours and no more affects our trade and the rights or interests of our people than war in the Paciiic Ocean. A. war on shoie, which forces our people to leave Muscat, is far more injurious; yet we make no pretence of inteifeiing on shore. « There could be no clearer proof that our policy in the Oman sea is inexpedient, indefen sible, and positively dangerous, than the action of the Political Agent in the present instance under orders from Bombay. The sooner we quietly withdraw from it the better. 162. The Viceroy wrote :— “ 1 cannot be responsible for maintaining the policy laid down by this Government and approved by the Secretary of State, if orders directly contravening that policy and disregarding our orders are issued by a subordinate Government without our knowledge. I am not going to enter into any discussion with the Bombay Government on the subject, but I would state the question without reference to the particular merits of this case to the Secretary of State, and ask for a precise and conclusive decision. A copy may go to Bombay/’ The Hon’hie B. H. Ellis and Sir It. Temple were unable to concur in recognizing the distinction which the Eoreign Secretary “ drew so rigidly between the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. 163. The affair was reported to Secretary of State in despatch Vo. 13, dated 3rd April 1871. After reciting the main facts the despatch proceeded:— “ The instructions of the Bombay Government, issued by telegraph on the 9th of January 1871, to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and received from him by the Political Agent at Muscat on the following day, have never been reported to the Government of India. They are at variance with the instructions issued by us on 4th August* i )Ur l^r h N °’ 266 ’ dat€&lt;1 1869, and are such as it was beyond the competency of any subordinate Government to give without the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council- The question involved was one of imperial policy. The proceedings taken upon the instructions of the Bombay Government were really an act of war, and at one time threatened to lead to retaliation on the part of the Muscat Government. The question, therefore, was not only one which, under ordinary circumstances, ought properly to have been referred to us, but it was one on which the Bombay t 13 tieo. III., Cap. G3, Sec.j). Government are prohibited by Acts of Parliamentt from taking action except with our express permission. “ 5. The ground upon which the Bombay Government appears to have based its instructions is that, as a state of war had broken out in Muscat, we were bound to maintain a neutral position between the combatants, and to prevent Syud Azan from doing for his own defence what we would not permit Syud Toorkee to do for purposes of aggression. In our opinion, it is quite unnecessary to discuss the question whether Syud Toorkee was entitled to be recognized as a belligerent, or whether he was more than a rebel and insurgent against the de facto Government. That question involves many difficult and delicate considerations which have nothing whatever to do with the present case. In the instance under consideration Syud Azan was de facto Ruler of Muscat, with exception of the town of Soor, of which Syud Toorkee had succeeded in taking forcible possession. The fort of Mutthra and the unbroken line of coast between Muscat and Mutthra were also in the possession of Syud Azan. The boat that was sunk appears never to have left what was constructively Muscat territory. Every condition, therefore, required under our orders of 4th August 1869 was fulfilled, and under those orders the boat ought not to have been interfered with. “ 6 . But apart from the merits of this particular case, we believe that our general policy in respect to Muscat and our position in the Sea of Oman requires very careful consideration. We have already pointed out, in our despatch of 27th May 1870 that, strictly speaking, our obligations to prevent war at sea extend only to the Persian Gulf. Whether our policy in the Persian Gulf rests on engagements contracted with the Arab Chiefs of the littoral, or on measures adopted for the security of our subjects and the protection of commerce, it is one which we have consistently pursued for the last fifty years with the happiest results as regards the peace of these seas. It is a policy from which, for the reasons set forth at length in our despatches marginally quoted, it is neither possible nor desir- No. is, dated 22nd February 1870, able that we should recede. In the Gulf of Oman the cir- No Pa 28rXted 6 20th May 1870, para- cumstances are different; and the active assertion of our graphs 12-14. supremacy in that sea is of very recent date. Never till the close of the year 1868 did the Government of India attempt by force to prevent warlike operations in the Gulf of Oman. They were drawn into it almostinsensibly from having- taken a more direct and immediate interest in the domestic politics and dynastic changes in Muscat than we are now disposed to consider expedient. Although the position we had assumed was distasteful * to Azan bin (xhies, * See our despatch Xo. 31, dated 27th and although the original instructions f of 11th December May 1870, paragraph 9. 1868 and 28th January 1869 for the prevention of all war- December 1868, and No. 61, dated llke operations in the Sea ot Oman, which appear to have 24th February 1869. originated in a geographical error, were very soon found to be impracticable, and had to be modified by the later instructions of 4th August 1869, still so long as Azan bin Ghies continued in power, we considered it desirable to adhere to the policy which had been entered on. But we would take advantage of the recent events at Muscat, without any declaration of a marked change in policy, gradually to cease to exert a power which, unless exercised with the greatest care and good judgment, may at any time lead to very serious complications ; and we would gradually return to those relations with Muscat which existed before we attempted to take on ourselves the forcible sup pression of warlike operations in the Gulf of Oman. “ 7. We are no doubt very materially interested in the preservation of the peace of these waters. If disturbances broke out, it might be difficult to prevent their spreading to the Persian Gulf. It has, therefore, been long our policy to exert our legitimate influence to preserve the peace on the coasts of Mekran and Oman. At the same time there is not, and has never been, the same occasion for a direct exhibition of force as in the Persian Gulf, the southern shores of which are inhabited by a multitude of warlike tribes owning no common authority. If our relations with the Ruler of Muscat are of a friendly kind, we entertain no doubt that by advice and the exercise of our influence we can practically obtain the same results as regards the general peace and safety of the Sea of Oman as we now secure by measures, the propriety of which is not altogether beyond question. 8 . If, therefore, Syud Toorkee should establish his position and should evince a desire for the formal recognition of the British Government, we propose to recognize him as the Ruler of Muscat; and if he should express his determination to endeavour to recover by force of arms the outlying possessions of Muscat, we would inform him that he is quite at liberty to do so, and that there is no longer any necessity for maintaining so rigidly as heretofore the prohibition of warlike operations outside the Persian Gulf. At the same time, although we should not directly interfere if he endeavoured to recover by force the distant possessions of Muscat out side the Persian Gulf, we would endeavour as a preferable course by friendly offices to enable him to settle such disputes amicably. By this means we should gradually be relieved of the responsibility we have by insensible degrees assumed for the preservation of the maritime peace on a line of coast extending from Kurrachee to the northern limits of the Mozambique Channel, to which we drew Your Grace's attention in our despatch No. 32, dated 27th May 1870. It is under any circumstances a course we should deem it absolutely incumbent on us to adopt in the event of Her Majesty's Government deciding that the Zanzibar subsidy is not in future to be paid to Muscat. “ 9. Minutes by the Hon'ble Sir R. Temple and the Hon'ble Mr. Ellis, dissenting from the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 , enclosed.'' Dated 3rd April 1871. Minute by the Hon'ble B. H. Ellis. 164. I fully concur in the first five paragraphs of this despatch, but I am unable to give full concurrence to other parts, especially paragraphs 6 and 7 . 2 . I so far agree that I believe, as stated in the commencement of the 6 th paragraph, our policy in regard to Muscat and the Sea of Oman requires careful reconsideration; for we have in recent years gone beyond what was necessary or expedient for the maintenance of the maritime peace in these waters. If we have exceeded our legitimate duty, it was not, in my opinion, owing to our having taken too direct an interest in the dynastic changes in Muscat, hut rather owing to our having held aloof from Muscat affairs, and hesitated to recognize any one as Sovereign. To maintain a position of impartial neutrality, we prevented all alike from breaking the maritime peace. 3. The interests of Muscat are intimately hound up with those of our Indian ports on the one hand, and with those of the Persian Gulf on the other, and it seems impossible to draw so clear a distinction between the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman as to maintain our policy in the one case, and wholly recede from it in the other. While there was a strong Government at Muscat our interference outside the Gulf was not called for, and it will not he needed if a strong Government be again established, hut we cannot say that if needr ( 48 ) 'I arises, we are not to prevent raids by sea, and piracy under the name of warfare, in circumstances which would justify our interference inside the Gulf. 4. Instead, therefore, of laying down a stringent rule that we are to cease wholly to exert in the Gulf of Oman the power which we propose to maintain unimpaired in the Persian Gulf, I would be content with stating that this power is not to be exercised so freely as of late. In the proposal to recognize Syud Toorkee, and to allow him full liberty to recover by an expedition by sea his outlying possessions, I quite concur, and I conceive that we can give this per mission without waiving our rights to intervene, if circumstances should appear to us to demand our maintaining the maritime peace in the Sea of Oman. 5 . I have no objection to withdraw any pretensions that may have been asserted in regard to the sea from Easal Had to the Mozambique Channel. It will be understood that the remarks above recorded apply only to the Sea or Gulf of Oman. Dated 3rd April 1871. Minute by the Hon'ble Sir R. Temple. 165. I entirely concur in the above minute by Mr. Ellis. I further think we ought to interfere whenever necessary to preserve the maritime peace in the Sea of Oman, or whenever necessary for our political or commercial interests in that quarter. 165. Just before these papers arrived, the following interesting minutes were written:— (Confidential.) “ From the time that I came to India first to the present I have had the misfortune to dis agree with my predecessors in this Government, and also with the Secretary of State, on many points of the policy hitherto adopted with regard to the States of Oman and a portion of the Arabian Coast. “I always felt that the direct interference in the affairs of Muscat, which had been for some years carried on, would ultimately entangle us in a complicated net of difficulties; that our position with regard to their vast extent of coast is untenable, and should be considered wholly different from that which we had assumed with regard to the Persian Gulf; that the safety of our trade did not necessitate any such action; and that we really had as much right and interest to meddle in the affairs of Oman as we had in the affairs of Madagascar. However, I found it impossible absolutely to recede—Syud Toorkee was a prisoner in Bombay, brought thither in a very questionable manner. We had interdicted all warlike maritime operations on the Coasts of Oman-and Mekran. Colonel Disbrowe was misrepresenting British interests at Muscat. We found it difficult, nay almost impossible, to recognize the de facto Ruler of the country,* and we considered the suggested action of the Secretary of State with regard to the Zanzibar sub sidy a political mistake, and one which was little short of a breach of faith. “ The suppresion of the slave trade enters so largely into the consideration of Her Majesty's Government in respect to these matters, that it complicates the question still further, because, though it naturally occupies a foremost place in the minds of Her Majesty's Government, it is a matter of Imperial policy with which the Government of India have nothing to do. “ Azan bin Gheis's question with regard to our real intentions and policy was so awkward that it has never really been answered. I thought at the time, and still think, that it was really unanswerable. However, as events roll on in the manner so well described in the Secretary's notes, the difficulties do not decrease, and I certainly am prepared to advocate under certain circum stances a bold and decided course. “ If Syud Toorkee establishes himself at Muscat, I should recognize him at once. “ I should inform him that we did not propose to interfere with any movements which he might find it necessary for his safety to make either for the defence of his shores or the recovery of what he may consider his ancient possessions. “ The duty of suppressing piracy is one that is common to the cruisers of all civilized nations, and beyond that duty which imposes itself on our ships in all parts of the world I would not interfere. “ H Her Majesty's Government think it their duty to take upon themselves the suppression or restriction of the slave trade between Muscat and the Arabian Coast on the one side and Zanzibar on the other, I certainly think that all communications on that score should be made to Muscat by Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. \ A &gt;£0f 4 # &gt; ( 49 ) ff I object to the Indian Government undertaking the Police of the seas from Kurrachee to Madagascar which is the position we have almost landed ourselves in. “ Put then it may he said, suppose in the event of Syud Toorkee establishing himself on the throne of Muscat, and Zanzibar under our advice declined to pay a debt which we think, in opposition to the views of the Secretary of State, is justly due, and suppose that Syud Toorkee is certain that he has a right either to the Zanzibar throne or the Zanzibar subsidy, and declares war with the present Ruler of Zanzibar, what course should we then take ? “ My reply is, that is a matter entirely to be decided by Her Majesty’s Government, and that if they choose to assume that it is the right or duty of England to interfere and by force to prevent Toorkee obtaining by warlike means those rights to which he thinks he is entitled, the Indian Government have nothing to do with the matter. “ As an individual, I should not hesitate to state my opinion that the policy of interference was imprudent and unjust, but as a member of the Government of India I do not see that we are bound to interfere further than to make such representations in the interests of any of 1 ler Majesty’s Indian Native subjects who might be affected by the proceedings of the Governments of Zanzibar and Muscat. “ I think an opportunity has now risen 'Which will enable us to recede from a false and dan gerous position, and that no time should be lost in addressing the Secretary of State in the sense of the foregoing and of the Secretary’s remarks. 20-2-71. (Sd.) M. 20-2-71. (Sd.) J. S. 28-2-71. (Sd.) H. W. N. 106. I apprehend that we have an interest in protecting the consider able trade which exists between India and Muscat and India and Zanzi bar. To that extent we are interested in the stability of the de facto Government, whatever it be of those portions of the Coasts of Arabia and Africa. And we have entered at different times into political relations in respect thereto from which we cannot recede. Hut beyond this I would not go, and I would abstain from interference in the' interior as much as possible. I also agree that the suppression of the slave trade between Arabia and Africa is not at all a matter for India, but is a question solely for Her Majesty’s Government in England. (Sd.) II. T. 167. I am not prepared to concur unreservedly in the views here set forth. I considered that the despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 31 of 1870, dated 27th May, paragraphs 12 and 15, gave a correct exposition of what ought to be our policy, and I conceive that we could not recede from the assertion of our supremacy in the Gulf of Oman with more credit or safety than we would from our position in the Persian Gulf. It is true that there are special Treaties with certain maritime tribes in the Persian Gulf which give us special rights, but those engagements affect only the tribes with whom they were concluded, and our general rights there rest on precisely the same grounds as those in the Gulf of Oman. I fail to perceive that there is any essential difference between our relations with Muscat and with the States on the borders of the Persian Gulf that we should resign the supremacy which we have long exercised in the Gulf of Oman as fully as in the Persian Gulf. The intercourse of our traders with Muscat is even closer than with the States of the Persian Gulf, and we ought not to withdraw from our position in the Gulf of Oman, if we would maintain our character in the Persian Gulf and protect our interests in these seas generally. These remarks do not apply to the coast southwards from Itas-el-IIad to the neighbourhood of Aden, for with this, so far as Indian interests are involved, I concur with His Excellency in considering that we have no concern. The difficulties which are stated to have arisen seem to me to have been caused by mistakes ot policy, and as first and foremost in such mistakes I would, with all deference for the decision of higher authority, point to the orders of N( 50 ) which the late Viceroy was arbitrator, a guarantee was given under the si-nature of the Governor-General of India, and the settlement was declared by him “ to extend to your respective successors and to be held to he a tmal and permanent arrangement,” and that, therefore, the Government of India is deeply interested, and I would lose no opportunity of pressing this on Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. As I understand that Ilis Excellency does not propose to make an^ formal renunciation of our claim to interference, I am not sure that there is aii\ practical ditference of opinion between His Excellency and me, for I would certainly aid Syud Toorkee as His Excellency proposes, to enable him to estab lish himself more firmly; but, on the other hand, if on pretence of claiming the Muscat throne a number of other pretenders were to commence warlike or piratical operations by sea, I should not hesitate to put them down just as w e have hitherto done. 168. I am inclined to think that in this matter we are, and have been, hampering ourselves needlessly by laying down general rules of conduct instead of acting in particular cases with a view to interests which we have an un doubted right to protect by force. Why not content ourselves with preventing proceedings which are substantially piratical, and which as such endanger our own interests. The declaration on which I gave my opinion a year ago appears to me to be indefensible if it is construed as going beyond what we should be justified in doing without it, and unnecessary if we so construe it as to confine its meaning within the limits of what we could do without it. “ I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 24C.-P., of the 12 th ultimo, giving cover to copy of a despatch No. 13, dated the 3rd April addressed to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State, regarding Muscat affairs. “ 2. From this despatch His Excellency in Council has for the first time become aware that the instructions of this Government, conveyed to Colonel Felly by telegraph on the 9th of January last, were not at once communicated by telegraph to the Government of India. It 27-2-71. (Sd.) B. H. E. 2-3-71. (Sd.) J. E. S. 169. The Bombay Government wrote :— (No. 2145, dated 25th May 1871.) \( 51 ) is the established rule that all telegrams of importance should be immediately repeated to Cal cutta The rule was unfortunately not acted on in the present instance through an oversight in the Secretariat, and the absence of the Political Secretary on tour with His Excellency the Governor in Guzerat no doubt led to the omission remaining unnoticed at the time. His Excellency in Council desires to express his great regret that this error should have occurred. At the same time he feels it his duty to point out that the Government of India are scarcely accurate m stating that the * “ Resolution. —The reply to Major Way’s question as to permitting Muscat Government to send an expedition against Soor by sea must be in the nega tive. As long as a state of war did not exist on the Coast, the reinforce ment of the garrison on the Coast was not a hostile operation. It is our object to preserve a neutral position between the combatants, and to prevent all warlike operations by sea. We should abandon our neutral position if the Muscat Government were permitted to undertake not defensive, but offensive, operations as proposed.” (Vide Abstract of Proceedings, pige 23, Entry No. 83.) instructions of the 9th of January last have never been reported to the Government of India, as they were embodied in explicit terms in Govern ment Resolution,* No. 184, of the 14th idem, which was for warded to Calcutta on the 4th of February last, in the Abstract of Proceedings for the month of January 1871. « 3 ]$ u t even if these instructions had not been communicated to the Government of India His Excellency in Council cannot but express his surprise that the Right Hon’ble the Viceroy in Council should have deemed it necessary to make such an omission a ground of complaint to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State, without, in the first instance, affording to this Government an opportunity for explanation. Even in the case of subordinate officers, it is not customary to pass censure without first asking for an explanation. And where a local Govern ment is concerned, it appears that a departure from this salutary practice must necessarily pro duce misunderstandings, and impair those cordial relations which should exist between the Supreme and the local Governments. In the present instance, if the explanation of this Government had been asked for, the Government of India would not have assumed that the omission was intentional, and an oversight in the Secretary’s Office would not have become the around for a serious representation to the Home authorities. ((4 From a similar cause, His Excellency in Council has been placed at a disadvantage with reference to the instructions recently issued by him regarding Muscat affairs. For he has now learnt for the first time that the proceedings of this Government have not been approved. The course taken by His Excellency in Council was not adopted without due care and considera tion, and the circumstances will presently be set forth in detail. But what I am here directed to point out is, that His Excellency in Council conceives that he has just reason for complaint when his proceedings arc condemned without due consideration of his grounds of action. It would have been easy for the Government of India to have ascertained from this Government the ground on which the instructions to Colonel Felly of the 9th of January last were based, but 'they have preferred themselves to supply the reasons, and then to condemn the action of the Bombay Government, because those reasons are invalid. Thus in paragraph 5 of the despatch, it is stated as follows :—' The ground upon which the Bombay Government appears to have based its instructions is that as a state of war had broken out in Muscat, we were bound to maintain a neutral position between the combatants and to prevent Syud Azan from doing for his own defence what we would not permit Syud Toorkee to do for purposes of agression.’ But it appears to have escaped the notice of the Government of India that the reference to which the orders were a reply was for instructions in case an attempt was made, not to defend Muttra, but to drive out Syud Toorkee from Soor by aggressive operations from seaward. And if the Right Hon’ble the Viceroy in Council had been pleased to refer to Gov ernment Resolution No. 184, of the 14th of January last (vide paragraph 2 of this letter), it would have been apparent that the orders of this Government referred to offensive operations only. For the opening direction of that Resolution runs as follows :—'The reply to Major AY ay’s question as to permitting Muscat Government to send an expedition against Soor by sea must be in the negative ;’ and the Resolution thus concludes :—' It is our object to preserve a neutral position between the combatants and to prevent all warlike operations by sea. We should abandon our neutral position if the Muscat Government were permitted to undertake not defensive but offensive operations as proposed! 11 5. With these preliminary observations I am now directed briefly to review the various orders which have been passed regarding the maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gulf of Oman. This appears to be necessary in order clearly to show the position of this Government and the grounds upon which the instructions now under consideration were issued. “ 6 . In his letter No. 115, dated 21 st November 1868, Colonel Felly reported that there was an intention on the part of Syud Salem to collect some of the tribes from the Arab Coast to recover Muscat, as he considered the tribes to the southward still loyal to his cause. Colonel Felly had thus instructed Captain Way:—'Syud Salem is desirous of embarking some men from the Arab Coast on board of his men-of-war. I am telegraming to Government on the subject. In the meantime I do not think that I am authorized in preventing him so long as no breach of the peace at sea occurs in the Persian Gulf. Syud Salem would use his men solely on the Coast of Oman for the recovery of his lost dominions.’ Subsequently Colonel Felly informed this Government (vide his No. 118, of '3rd December 1868) that Syud Salem sX ( 52 ) Minister had limited his proposal to the employment of some men of the Henavee tribe from the Aboothabee Coast, and that accordingly he had agreed not to interfere with them provided no breach of the maritime truce should occur, and the ships on board of which the sailors might be embarked should not be employed otherwise than in His Highness’ Muscat dominions. « 7 Such was the state of circumstances in the Gulf of Oman when Sir J. Lawrence issued the following order on the 9th of January 1869 ‘ Naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of arms if necessary.’ Under this order of the Government of India, no armaments by sea were allowed either in the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman, and the prohibition was held to extend to Gwadur and the coast of Mekran. The order was general, both as to parties and places, and no exception was made to the enforcement of the rule by force or, in the language of the Government of India, by an act of war if necessary. At the same time, the clearly-understood policy of the British Government, as shown from the commencement to the end of the official papers on Muscat affairs, was one of complete and scrupulous neutrality. So long as the peace at sea was not violated, and British subjects were unmolested, no interference with any military operations by land was to take place. “ 8 . Early in May of the same year Syud Azan, who was in possession of Muscat, desired to reinforce his forts at Birkah by sending thither some troops and ammunition by sea. It appeared to Lieutenant-Colonel Disbrowe, then our Agent at Muscat, that the prohibition of the Government of India extended to the transport by sea even of necessary reliefs and supplies for the various garrisons on the Coast, and on Syud Azan proceeding to despatch troops notwithstanding his protest, Colonel Disbrowe suspended diplomatic rela tions and retired on board a sloop of war in the harbour of Muscat. Reference was made to this Government for instructions, and it appeared to His Excellency in Council that this was an erroneous construction of the order which appeared to be directed against warlike operations by sea, or operations in furtherance of actual or imminent hostilities. But before this view could be communicated to Colonel Disbrowe, it appeared that a similar view had been taken by Colonel Felly who was at that time at Muscat, and'the transport of the reinforcements was permitted by that officer, as reported in his despatch of 27th May 1869. Subsequently the Government of India, in their despatch, dated 4th August 1869, expressed their concurrence ‘ in the interpretation ’ put by Colonel Felly on the original orders of the Government of Sir J. Lawrence of 9th January 1869. “ 9 . With reference to this interpretation of Sir J. Lawrence’s order. Colonel Disbrowe shortly afterwards informed Syud Salem {vide letter of 10th August 1869) that Colonel Felly had given Syud Azan permission to transport ammunition, stores, &amp;c., along the Oman Coast that lies between Sohar on the north and Ras-el-Had on the south. Whereon this Govern ment passed the following Resolution, dated 11 th November 1869 :— c Colonel Disbrowe’s letter to His Highness Syud Sa lem docs not seem accurately to represent the permission given by Colonel Felly and concurred in by Government which was to transport by sea the ordinary supplies of ammunition and stores required by forts in his possession. Any extraordinary supplies for a force in the field would properly be stopped.’ This Resolution, which clearly indicated the interpretation placed by this Government on the orders of Sir J. Lawrence, as modified by the subsequent ruling of the Government of India, was communicated to Colonel Felly, and became the rule for the guidance of our officers in the Gulf. The Government of India neither at the time nor since have expressed any dissent as to the correctness of this interpretation. Vide Abstract of Proceedings of the Government of Bombay in the Poli tical Department for November 1869. Entry No. 141, page 42. “ 10 . At a later date, a reference was made to this Government by Colonel Felly for instructions as to whether Syud Toorkee should be permitted to cross the Gulf into Muscat territory. Although it was clear that he could have but one object in landing on the Arab Coast, it did not appear to this Government that his crossing even with a hostile intent came under the term f naval operations,’ and that to prevent his doing so would be an active inter ference in favor of Syud Azan and his Government. And accordingly Colonel Felly was instructed thus by telegram :—‘ If Syud Toorkee attempts to cross to Soor or Bahrein with an armed following, you arc at once to prevent him; but if he embarks alone with only his personal servants, you are not to interfere.’ In pursuance of these instructions, Syud Toorkee was permitted to cross the Gulf and joined the armed forces in his interest who had seized and occupied Soor. These orders having been reported to the Government of India, the following reply was received :—‘ Unless maritime peace is broken and warlike operations are being carried on by sea, no interference should take place. Colonel Felly should not prevent Toorkee going to Soor alone or with a few followers. Viceroy agrees in opinion expressed in your telegram.’ “ 11. Having been joind by the most powerful tribes of the south, it was rumoured that Syud Toorkee intended to send an expedition by sea to attack Muttra. Such an expedition would necessarily have proceeded within Muscat waters along the Coast in the same way as would an expedition from Muscat to Birkah or Muttra; but he was warned by Colonel Felly * y( 53 ) that it would fall within the prohibition regarding warlike operations by sea, and that it would be prevented by force of arms if necessary. And the intention, if it was entertained, was abandoned. “ 13. The above is a brief review of affairs in the Gulf of Oman, showing the original orders of Sir J. Lawrence and the mode in which those orders have, in repeated instances during the last two years, been interpreted and acted on by this Government and their officers in the Gulf. I proceed to consider the case which forms the subject of the present correspondence. “ 13. In this instance the instructions of Government were requested on the following reference being made by Ma jor Way to Colonel Felly :—‘ It is not impossible that an attempt may be made to drive Syud Toorkee out of Soor, and I would solicit instructions in case the Muscat Government wish to make any such attempt from seaward/ And the following tele graphic reply was given, dated bth January last :—‘ The permission to Muscat Government to reinforce garrisons on coast by sea cannot be continued now that a state of war exists in Muscat territory, as we should thus abandon our neutral position between the combatants. All military operations by sea must be prevented/ ■“ 14. These are the instructions to which the Government of India have now taken exception, and with regard to which it is stated in the despatch to the Secretary of State that they are (1) at variance with the instructions issued by the Goverment of India on 4th August 1309; and (3) are such as it was beyond the competency of any subordinate Government to give without the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council. “15. With regard to the former of these points, it is to be observed that the letter of the Government of India of 4th August 1369 does not contain instructions of any kind. It simply conveys the approval of the Viceroy in Council ‘ of the interpretation of the orders of the Supreme Government relative to operations at sea contained in the letter from Colonel Felly to the address of Colonel Disbrowe/ dated 37th May 1399. It is true that Colonel Felly inti mates the opinion that the orders of Sir J. Lawrence were mainly directed against expeditions such as might be contemplated from Mekran or Bunder Abbass against Muscat, or from Muscat for the recovery of those possessions ; but it may be observed that such a limitation is altogether inconsistent with the distinct statement of the policy of the Government of India contained in their despatch of October 11th, 1869, of which the orders themselves were only a more explicit enunciation, and at variance with the circumstances which existed at the time as reported by Colonel Felly himself (vide paragraph 0 above). And this Government, therefore, understood the approval of the Government of India to apply to the instruction given by Colonel Felly and not to the arguments on which they were based, and to indicate that the original orders of Sir J. Lawrence, namely, that ‘ naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of arms if necessary/ still held good ; but that the prohibition did not extend to the transport by sea of ordinary supplies and reliefs for the simple reason that such transport did not constitute f naval operations/ Accordingly in their Resolution of 11th * November 1869, this Government held that the prohibition was in force with regard to the transport of ‘ extraordinary supplies for a force in the field/ And, in the present instance, it is submitted that there can be no reasonable doubt that sending artillery to troops that were being collected to drive an invading force from their position is a warlike operation by sea. It appears, therefore, to His Excellency in Council that the instructions of this Government on the 9th of January last, so far from being at variance, were in strict accordance with the orders of the Government of India as they stood at the time when the letter of the 4th of August 1869 had been received by this Government. And, further. His Excellency in Council cannot resist the conclusion that if an opportunity had been afforded to him of recalling to the recollection of the Government of India the Resolution of November 11th, 1869, to which I have adverted, their views of the action taken by this Government in the present instance would have been materially modified. It will be apparent to the Government of India that that Resolution was sufficiently explicit to have justified Major Way in preventing the trans port of artillery under the circumstances noted without further reference to Government, and that, in reply to Colonel Felly’s request for instructions, it would have been sufficient for Government to have referred him to that Resolution for his guidance. “ 16. With regard to the second point, I am desired to convey the assurance of His Excellency in Council that he has no desire whatever to trench upon the authority secured to the Right Hon’ble the Governor-General in Council by Acts 13 and 33 of Geo. 111. The sole object of this Government has been to carry out without question or hesitation the policy of the Government, of India. In cases of emergency, and in cases in which the construction of the existing orders seemed too clear to admit of a reasonable doubt, His Excellency in Council has from time to time given the necessary instructions to the officers on the spot. This amount of discretion is conceded by the Government of India even to Colonel Felly and other local officers. But in cases where a doubt exists, the local Government would equally, by rule, and for their own protection, feel themselves bound to refer to the Supreme Government. “17. In the case which has given rise to the present correspondence, His Excellency in Council has, from your despatch to the Secretary of State, learnt with regret that the orders given by him in January last are opposed to the policy of the Government of India, who O( 54 ) # intimate that they would have allowed to Syud Azan what they refused to Syud Toorkee. It appears to His Excellency in Council that such a course would have been inconsistent with our declared neutrality and with the policy laid down by Sir J. Lawrence. If, however, the local Government had had any reason to believe that the altered policy stated m the Secretary of State, had been adopted by the Government of India, it would have been their dutv at once to hive carried it out. All that they did was simply to interpret, and, as it still appears to His Excellency in Council, reasonably to interpret, antecedent orders m execu- .• . • rpvprsa i 0 f or even in addition to, the instructions laid down by Sir J. Lawrence. And though undoubtedly obedience was enforced by an act of war, sucli an act of war was*expressly directed by the instruction that all naval operations should be prevented by force if necessary. , , „ . , v ,, . “ IS. That this interpretation was given without antecedent reference to the Government of India was caused by what appeared to be the urgency of the case, though Hb Excellency in Council is bound to add that the construction seemed to him so clear that even if there had been no necessity for an early reply to Colonel Polly, he would have hesitated to think, after the Resolution of this Government of November 11th, 1869, that a reference was necessary. “19 In conclusion, I am directed to request that the Right Hon’ble the Viceroy in Council may he pleased to take an early opportunity of forwarding a copy of this communica tion to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State. His Excellency in Council would naturally have preferred that the Government of India should have allowed him an opportunity of explanation before imputing to his Government insubordination and illegality. But, in any case, it is desired that this statement should reach England before any opinion in the matter is expressed by the Home authorities.” 170 The Under-Secretary compiled a precis of the correspondence on this matter—the extent of the prohibition to carry on operations by Sea in the Gtdi of Oman. « X n answer to the Bombay Government’s requests for instructions on Syud Salem s expul sion from power bv Azan bin Gheis m October and Proceedings, December 1868, No. 97. November 1868, the Government of India, 24th Novem ber 1868, telegraphed ‘that we should not interfere in any way, but should watch the progress of events.” ^ . On the 5th December 1868 the Bombay Government telegraphed that Syud Salem from the north side of the Gulf was collecting a force in order to recover Muscat from whence he had been expelled. The Bombay Government gathered from the previous instructions of the Government ot India that Syud Salem would not be prevented. The Government of India (Xo. 1451,11th December 1868) expressed its “opi nion that the best and truest policy to adopt will he to refuse either ud Salem oi Svud Toorkee permission to attempt to enter Muscat by force from the sea board. The main considerations which have influenced His Excellency in Council in. comin- to this determination are, that, as guardian of the public peace m those waters^ the Government of India is bound to interfere in the course of order and securitv against confusion and violence. It may often he prudent and politic not to interfere in disputes between rival claimants to power when dissensions break out between such claimants actually, residents in the country or city which is the seat of dominion. But His Excellency in Council thinks that we are fully iustified by our supremacy and position in regard to affairs in the Persian Gulf in not quietly permitting a forcible attempt at re-entry on the part of a Ruler, who has already been forcibly ejected by an opponent aided by the people over whom the rule was exercised.” On the 8th January 1869 the Bombay Government asked whether it was intended to prevent, and that by force of arms, if necessarv, Syud Azan from attacking Bunder Abhass. The Government of India replied by telegrams dated 9th January 1869 that “ all naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should he prevented by force of arms if necessary,” and learning by Bombay letters Nos. 5 and 6, dated 9th January, that Colonel Belly understood it to he in accor dance with the policy of non-interference that there should he no interterenced * Proceedings, February 1869 , Nos. with Syud Salem’s projected move, the Government 23i-232. n of India (telegram* of 23rd January, and letter of 28th January) repeated the instructions of 11th December and 8th January.

Muscat State on the Mekran Coast on the one hand, and the main coast line of the Muscat on Oman dominions proper, as they stretch from Bas-ool-Had to Sohar.” The next paper is the important letter dated 27th May f 1869 from Colonel ■f Proceedings, August 1869, Nos. 1 ^Uy to Colonel Dlshl’OW6, tllC pilipOlt of the GoA - 116117 - eminent of India’s approval of which is so com pletely misunderstood by the Government of Bombay. “Syud Azan had embarked munitions of war on board one of his crafts in view of throwing them into the port of Burka, Colonel Disbrowe warned him of instructions received from the Government of India to prevent operations at sea by force, if necessary. Syud Azan persisted in his embarkation and the craft left. Colonel Disbrowe, to mark his sense of Azan’s disregard of the injunction, hauled down his flag. Colonel Belly “ doubted whether the Viceroy would desire to apply the orders to craft leaving the port of Muscat in view to ammunitioning the Forts of Oman, situate on the unbroken coast line of the Muscat dominions proper between Bas-ool-llad and Sohar. A craft so plying, he said, would pass along the continuous coast line of the Muscat State, and need never be more than gun-shot distance from the water line. Hence the craft need never leave what are constructively considered to be territories of the State, and unless caught at sea en route at more than gun-shot distance from the water line would not come under the category of a craft operating by sea. “ The case of a craft crossing from the Muscat port, or the Muscat Coast to the outlying territories of Mekran or Bunder Abbass is obviously different, because to reach those outlying regions the craft must quitt he Muscat Coast and cross the sea.” But Colonel Disbrowe was by no means satisfied as to the justness of Colonel + r . 1QCQ v Belly’s judgment, and wrote + to the Bombay Gov- 158 - 159 . eminent representing “ the risks run in granting ' such a concession.” If Syud Azan, a Buler “ not recognized by us, be permitted to move muni tions along the coast by sea, will not Syud Salem, the Ex-Sovereign, who pretends to be endeavouring to recover his throne in like manner, consider himself per mitted to move with munitions down the coast by sea ? “ Again, even though no open enemy should appear, does not the permission to despatch vessels with munitions stand in danger of being abused ? So long as no temptation be thrown in the way, Syud Azan would probably respect, and cause to be respected, so valuable a concession, but let temptation to plunder or violence arise, ivill not the case assume an altered complexion ? ‘ To allow a particle of law on the waters to barbarous authorities like these, enveloped as they are in tyrannical prejudices, appears to lie dangerous. Had Syud Azan been a just and popular Ruler, a Ruler, too, recognized by us, of course the movement of troops and munitions by sea would have been his right; . yet for all that would not our maritime supremacy receive a shock did outrages like these, no matter by whom committed, pass unchecked by us ?’ remarks which, as usual, the Bombay Government passed on to the Government of India without comment. w The Bombay letter No. 256, dated 25th June, sending on the letters in fldch Colonel Disbrowe raised these objections, was received by the Govern- Political A., August 1869, So. 118. ''f 11 * ° f 'f , th&lt; l. lst , J %- , » WOS DOt till the 4th August that, by rso. 10/6, the Government ot India issued that approval of Colonel Belly’s interpretation of its order, which the Bombay Government now seeks to deprive of all force. Obviously, if theGovernment of Inditi lincl tliou^lit Colonel l^clly Ijnscd. Ins mterpietcition, vlneh was impugned by Colonel Disbrowe, on any wrong argument, it would lurve taken notice thereof. On the 3rd August (nearly tv r o months after its receipt, months after they had passed it on without remark), the Bombay Government answeied Colonel Disbrowe’s letter of the 11th June, impugning Colonel Belly’s interpre tation on the orders of Government, and said that Colonel Belly s \icw r ol the case v r as correct. Bhe movement ol reinforcements from one pait ol the teni- tory in the possession of Syud Azan to another cannot be considered, in the cii- cumstances under wdiich it took place, a hostile movement. Each case must stand on its ow n merits. IJ* active hostilities weve heinfj corded on in the vici nity, or on the adjacent coast of Muscat, the case would he different. And this answer the Government of India iniSo. 1177, dated 23rd August 18G9, approved without, perhaps, noticing the force of the words printed in italics, and which it is odd that the Bombay Government have not now brought forward to prove their point. On the 10th August 1869, Colonel Disbrowe wrote the following reply to a question on the part of the Ex-Ruler Syud Salem, as to whether Government had given to Azan a permission to act by sea which had been refused to him. ‘ I have nothing whatsoever to do with the land, but as regards the sea, Colonel Belly has, pending further instructions from Government, given Syud Azan permis sion to transport ammunition, stores, &amp;c., along the Oman Coast, that lies be tween Sohar on the north and Ras-el-Had on the south. This permission and nothing further, but no irregularity nor violence is permitted on the sea. • ‘ It becomes now my duty to inform Your Highness that this permission has been granted by Colonel Belly to Syud Azan and to no one else; further, to warn you that vessels helonging to any other party or parties that may be (found) on the sea having on board warlike stores or armed men, will render themselves liable to be immediately captured or sunk by Her Majesty’s Gun boats serving under my orders, and this course will be pursued by me until instructions to the contrary reach me from Government.’ He sent this up to the Government of Bombay in his No. 459, dated 18th August. The Bombay Government, in their No. 373, * dated 10th September 1869, sent on the paper, without remark, to the Govern- * S. I. Nos. 223 to 232 of 1869. - o x v 1 E i • -i. j. i i x ment of India, thus leaving it to be supposed that they saw nothing to dissent from in Colonel Disbrowe’s reply. But two months later, nearly three months after the date of Colonel Disbrowe’s letter, they passed the Resolution of 11th November, above referred to, dissenting from the tenor of Colonel Disbrowe’s reply for the following reason :— “ Colonel Disbrowe’s letter to His Highness Syud Salem does not seem accurately to represent the permission given by Colonel Belly, and concurred in by Government, which was to transport by sea the ordinary supplies of am munition and stores required by forts in his possession. Any extraordinary supplies for a force in the field would properly be stopped.” In this Resolution the Bombay Government obviously missed just the very point of the argument which made Colonel Belly’s the correct view. They did not report the Resolution to Government, but left it to be discovered in their volume of Broceedings. As has already been observed, a local Government can not pretend to be functus officio when, instead of reporting a proceeding, it leaves the supreme controlling authority to find out what it has done. 171. The answer to the Bombay Government was as follows:— (No. L327P., dated 29M June 1871.) “ I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2145, dated 25th May last, conveying* certain remarks on passages in the Secret despatch of the Government of India to( 57 ) the Secretary of State, No. 13, dated 3rd April, a copy of which was forwarded confidentially for the information of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay, in my letter No. 24C.P., dated 12th April. « 2 . Your letter explains that the omission to report immediately to the Government of India the telegram sent on the 9th January to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, was owing- to an oversight in the Secretary's Office, and it expresses the great regret of His Excel lency' in Council that this error should have occurred. At the same time it adds that the Gov ernment of India are scarcely accurate in stating that the instructions of 9th January have never been reported to the Government of India, as they were embodied in explicit terms in the Resolution of the Bombay Government of the 14th January, which found a place m the volume of Proceedings submitted on the 4th P ebruary. “ 3. Were it not for this remark, and the belief which from paragraph 9 of your letter the Governor-General in Council infers that the Bombay Government entertain, vfz., that the omission to criticize entries in the Monthly Abstract of Proceedings implies an approval of those proceedings, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council would not have thought it necessary to point out that no inference whatsoever regarding the opinion of the Government of India, either for or against any particular measure is to be drawn from the fact of no notice being taken of it on receipt of the Proceedings Volumes, and that the periodical submission of Proceedings Volumes does not absolve any local Government, least of all when the proceed ings are printed only in Abstract, from the duty of reporting at once, and specially all acts or orders affecting the Imperial policy. “4. The Resolution of 14th January was duly placed before the. Governor-General in Council when the despatch of 3rd April was written. But there was nothing at that time before the Government of India, nor is there yet, to connect the telegraphic orders of 9th January with the Resolution of the 14th January. If, as may be inferred from your letter under reply, both orders were in reply to the Resident’s letter of 3rd December on which the Resolution was based, that letter is not even now before the Government of India, and the Abstract of it in the Proceedings Volume gives no indication of its contents, except that it related to f the movements of His Highness Syud Toorkee/ The telegram of 9th January is a very distinct prohibition of all military operations Jjy sea, whether offensive or defensive. Major Way expressly stated in his report of the 25th January that he acted on the instruc tions conveyed in the telegram of the 9th. That he under stood them as prohibiting not offensive operations only, but all military operations by sea is evident, for the boat which was sunk by his orders was proceeding with a purely defensive object to the Fort of Muttra, distant only two-half miles from Muscat, and still in the possession of Azan bin Gheis. Indeed, the Resolution of 14th January could hardly have reached Major Way when the boat was sunk on the 23rd of that month. Moreover, when', on &amp;3rd February, the report of the Political Agent’s proceedings was forwarded to the Government of India, with the remark that the commendation of the Bombay Government had been communicated to the Political Agent for his energetic and judicious action, no allusion was made in vour report to the Resolution of 14th January, nor does it appear to have been observed that, if the orders of the Bombay Government referred to offensive operations only, the com mendation bestowed on the Political Agent was somewhat misplaced. : The permission to Muscat Government to reinforce garrison on coast by sea cannot be continued. * * * * All military operations by sea must be prevented.’' “ 5. His Excellency in Council does not consider that any advantage to the public interests will be gained by discussing at length the arguments advanced in paragraphs 5 to 15 of your letter. He will merely remark that he cannot approve of the endeavour which is made to de stroy the force of the letter of the Government of India of 4th August 18G9, on the ground that it does not contain instructions of any kind, but simply conveys the approval of ' the interpretation of the orders of the Supreme Government relative to operations at sea, contained in the letter from Colonel Pelly to the address of Colonel Disbrowe, dated 27th May, No. 52.’ His Excellency in Council does not understand the distinction between approval of a proposal and instructions to carry it out, or between approval of the interpretation of orders and instruc tions to act on the orders in the sense approved. That the interpretation put on the orders of Gov ernment by Colonel Pelly, and approved by the Government of India, prohibited interference with the transport of warlike stores by the Ruler of Muscat between points on the unbroken coast line of the Muscat dominions, provided the boats did not go beyond gun-shot from the shore or leave the waters which are constructively considered to be the territories of the State, does not admit of question. Had this interpretation not been superseded by the telegram of the Bombay Government of the 9th January, directing that f all military operations by sea must be pre- # zented,’ those unfortunate circumstances would not have occurred, on which His Excellency in Council has found it his duty to animadvert. “ (i. In paragraph 17 of the despatch under acknowledgment, a remark is made that the (Government of India ‘intimate that they would have allowed to Syud Azan what they refused to Syud Toorkee.’ His Excellency in Council has not been able to perceive in any part of the lespatch of the 3rd April the grounds for this statement. No such intimation is either made or implied in any portion of the despatch. P( 58 ) “ 7. In compliance with the request of the Bombay Government, the letter under acknow ledgment will be sent by the next mail to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, who has in the meantime been asked by telegraph to suspend an expression of opinion on the Secret despatch No. 13, dated 3rd April. This reply will also be communicated to the Secretary of State.' 172. The Bombay Government acknowledged this letter— (No. 3388, dated 'lind July 1871.) “ His Excellency in Council desires me to state that there is more than one point in your letter which would appear to require reply, but that he is so sensible of the inconvenience of dis cussion such as this, and so little desirous to continue it that he prefers to allow the question to rest, unless some reference by Her Majesty's Secretary of State to your letter under acknow ledgment makes any remarks on his part necessary.' CHAPTER VIII.— (Sections 173—192.) RENEWAL OF LEASE OF BUNDER ABBASS TO MUSCAT RULER. 173. An outline of the relations of the Sultans of Muscat towards Bunder Abbass is given in Wheeler’s Summary of Affairs in the Foreign Department of the Government of India, 1864-1869, pages 152-153. Mr. Girdlestone’s note on events in Oman subsequent to the expulsion of Syud Salem, § 16, continues the summary. 174. On 13th March 1871 Syud Toorkee applied for Colonel Felly’s assistance in arranging for the lease of the Bunder Abbass districts, upon which Colonel Felly asked the instructions of Government. 175. The Under-Secretary noted on this request— “ As regards Bunder Abbass it will be remembered that, with considerable difficulty, and only after Syud Salem had been on the point of blockading the port, Colonel Pellv managed to negotiate a renewal of the lease to Syud Salem and his descendants, the continuance thereof to any conqueror who might take possession of Oman and Muscat being expressly barred. “ When Azan bin Gheis turned out Salem the lease ceased, and Ilajee Ahmed, a Minister of Salem, was appointed Governor ostensibly in the interest of Persia. And with the approval of the Government of India the Bombay Government deferred taking any action in the matter till it turned out who would eventually be Sultan of Muscat, saying at the same time that the reasons which induced the British Government to desire that Bunder Abbass should be attached to Muscat still existed (those reasons being the interests of trade in the Persian Gulf, which were benefited by the habitual liberality of the Oman people in such matters). “ In September 1869 Sheikh Saeed, a former Governor of Bunder Abass, on the part of Sultan Thoweynee, recaptured it, but was immediately afterwards turned out by Ilajee Ahmed. “ Colonel Pelly might be desired quietly to ignore Syud Toorkee's present mention of the Bunder Abbass lease. As soon as Syud Toorkee feels himself quite secure, he will most probably follow the example of Salem and threaten Bunder Abbass, unless there is a renewal of the lease to which he, as a son of Syud Saeed, has the strongest claim. Then would be the time when the British Government might most advantageously step in.' 176. In the despatch No. 30, of 23rd May 1871, to the Secretary of State, the Government of India wrote:— &lt;£ As regards the lease of Bunder Abbass, we have to remind Your Grace that, in our Secret despatch No. 31, dated 27th May 1870, we solicited the instructions of Her Majesty’s Govern ment on the question whether we should hold out to Azan any hopes of the exercise of our friendly offices with Persia for the purpose of obtaining the restoration of the lease of Bunder Abbass. To that despatch no answer has arrived. The present claimant, Syud Toorkee is not a descendant of Syud Salem, and, therefore, he cannot claim under the lease of 1868- and although he is a son of Sultan Saeed, with whom the engagement of 1855 was contracted vet the agreement of 1868 having been made with the de facto Government of the day at Muscat may not unreasonably be considered to have superseded that of 1855, and, in virtue of the termination of the engagement of 1868, Persia has already entered into possession of Bunder Abbass.‘ ( 59 ) “ For these reasons we consider that we should be justified in declining to interfere in behalf of Syud Toorkee any more than in that of Azan bin Gheis. At the same time the British Government might, in our opinion, advantageously and without committing itself to interference, make an endeavour to sound the Persian Government as to the likelihood of a restoration, as a matter of favour, of the lease to Syud Toorkee, who has always been supposed to be a favourite with His Majesty the Shah.” 177. The Viceroy wrote to Mr. Alison demi-officially stating what had occurred, and asking for his opinion whether, under the altered circumstances of the case, he thought the Persian Government would object seriously to the renewal of the lease. 178. On the 2ith April 1871 (in Xo. 2382, from Bombay Government, 5th June 1871) Syud Toorkee wrote again :— “ Regarding Bunder Abbass, Ahmed has recently not been going on satisfactorily, and has been building without foundations, on this account the people have been desiring that 1 should lease Bunder Abbass and put them at their ease. “ I hope you will without delay arrange my affairs with Bunder Abbass. I do not seek Bunder Abbass with a view to profit, but to make the people comfortable.” With reference to the despatch, Xo. 27, of 23rd May 1871, to the Secre tary of State, the India Office addressed the Foreign Office:— “ i h e ^ iceroy enquires whether Her Majesty’s Government are prepared to exercise their o-ood offices with the Government of His Majesty the Shah of Persia to obtain the restoration of the lease of Bunder Abbass to Syud Toorkee. With reference to this* question, I am to state that the Duke of Argyll was prepared to recommend the renewal of the lease in favour of Syud Azan bin Gheis, had he remained supreme at Muscat. And His Grace is of opinion that there are still stronger reasons for using our friendly offices on behalf of a member of the family of Syud Saeed. He would, therefore, suggest that Lord Granville, if he should see no reason to the contrary, should place himself in communication with Mr. Alison, with a view to his obtaining from the Persian Government the restoration to the present Ruler of Muscat of the privilege in question.” 179. The Foreign Office, accordingly, issued in July or August 1871 a despatch to Air. Alison, Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran— “ The Governor-General of India has called the attention of Her Majestv’s Government to an application which has been made by the present Ruler of Muscat to be'recognized as such by the British Government, and that they should use their influence with the Persian Govern ment to obtain for him a renewal of the lease of Bunder Abbass. “ Various changes have taken place in the Government of Muscat since the lease was renewed m 1868 to the then existing Ruler, the Persian Government appear to have considered that agreement as terminated by those changes, and to have again entered into possession of Bunder Abbass. It will, however, be known to the Persian Government that, whereas some objection was laised at the time the to renewal of the lease to Syud Salem, on the score that he ha'd obtained the sovereignty of Muscat by usurpation and violence, no such objection can be ur&lt;&gt;-ed against the present Ruler, who is a son of Sultan Saeed with whom the Persian Government entered into an engagement in 1855, that he should farm the port of Bunder Abbass under cer tain conditions at an annual rent of 12,000 tomans. “ Under these circumstances I .have to instruct you to use your good offices with the view of obtaining from the Persian Government the restoration to the present Ruler of Muscat of the privilege granted to his father in 1855.” 180. On the 28tli July Air. Alison telegraphed to the Viceroy : “ This ■ Government appears disposed to farm Bunder Abbass to*Syud Toorkee but have doubts about his stability and solvency. The Shah will be here in a few days and I will let you know further.” il 81 ' 1 'f 1 ‘, i ? News -report, dated 17th July 1871, the Political Resident in the lersian Gull reported that disturbances were said to have broken out at Bunder Abbass, consequent upon the Governor of Alinao having collected a force with the intention of expelling Hajee Ahmed from the Government. The latter was preparing to resist. All was quiet at sea and on the Arab Coast. 182. ^ From the enclosure to the Bombay Government letters (Xos. 3829 and 3830, dated 17th August 1871) it appeared that the people of Bunder Abbass complained to the Prince Governor of Fars against the exactions of Hajee Ahmed, and that the latter had consented to proceed to Shiraz to answer the charges.( 60 ) 183 On the 19th June the British Native Agent at Lingah stated that news had been received from Bunder Abbass that Agha Mahsin, the brother of Ahmed Shah, had raised an army of 1,500 men for the purpose of attacking Bunder Abbass, and that Hajee Ahmed was preparing for . Ahmed Shah had taken Minao from tlie hands ot Hajee Ahmeds Governor, whom he had driven to Bunder Abbass. The Bombay Government said that it did not know who were A|ha Mahsin and Ahmed Shah. The Native Agent at Shiraz had said that Ahmed owed 20,000 tomans to the “ Dewan” on account of hist year s levemu, and that he had this year received revenue from the ryots, but had = lve \ ] “ the liewan.” The Bombay Government suggested that Agha Mahsin and Ahmed Shah might bo officers of “theDewan” referred to by the Agent a Shiraz. The Bombay Government were asked to ascertain who the men were. 184. Mr. Alison’s telegram was answered on 8th September :— “ Your telegram of k 28th July.

On 23rd September Mr. Alison again reported “ Shah will not consent to re-lease Bunder Abbass to the Imam of Muscat. Ilajee Ahmed Khan was received lately at Shiraz with honor and reconfinned. “ The Persian Government has no intelligence of the alarming state of affairs at Bunder Abbass as reported in despatch from Pelly of 23rd July. To which the Government of India replied (No. 2106P., 4th October 18/1) “ Yours of 23rd September regarding Bunder Abbass.^ Endeavour to persuade Persian Government not to decide finally till you hear further by post.” 187. In reply to a telegram asking whether Syud Toorkee would be pre pared to send an Envoy to Teheran, the Government of Bombay sent on a reply from Colonel Belly that he would gladly do so if he had reason to expect that the mission would prove successful. Colonel Belly would telegraph again after communication with Syud Toorkee. 188. The Government of India wrote to Mr. Alison (No. 2148P., 7th October 1871) :— “ With reference to your telegram of 23rd September, reporting that His Majesty the Shah will not consent to re-lease Bunder Abbass to the Sultan of Muscat, the \ iceroy and Governor-General in Council desires me to express a hope that you will be able to induce the Persian Government at all events to allow the question to remain an open one, and to abstain from giving any final decision at present. “ From the papers which I have the honor to enclose* Your Excellency will perceive that , ., since his accession to the Government of Muscat, Syud * From Colonel Pelly, to o ay _ov- ip oor j. ee p as on three occasions solicited the good offices of the British Government with a view to obtain for him a re-lease of Bunder Abbass. «Considering the length of time during which the Muscat Government have been entrusted with the administration of this sea-port, the friendly relations which it is desirable to see established between all the Governments possessing authority on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and the assistance which would be given to Syud Toorkee in consolidating his authority in Muscat, if His Majesty the Shah were to exhibit his confidence in the present Ruler by re-leasing Bunder Abbass on reasonable terms, considering also how very desirable it is that the British Government should be enabled to strengthen its influence at Muscat by the successful exercise of its good offices in the matter, His Excellency in Council desires me to express the hope that you will continue your endeavours, as opportunity may offer, to bring about so desirable a result, or, at all events, to prevent the question being finally closed by a decision adverse to Syud Toorkee’s hopes. eminent. Nos. 305-65, dated 25th March, and 465-115, dated 6th May 1871.( 61 ) “ His Excellency in Council is induced to urge this more strongly by the consideration that, on. receipt of your telegram of 10th September, a communication was made through the Bombay Government enquiring whether Syud Toorkee would be prepared to send an Agent to Teheran to negotiate and conclude the lease, and to that communication a favourable answer has been received. Your Excellency will easily understand what embarrassments will arise if, after communications have been made which gave rise to a reasonable expectation of a favour able issue to the negotiation, His Excellency in Council is under the necessity of informing Syud Toorkee that the Persian Government decline to renew the lease.” 189. On 13tli October 1871 Colonel Polly (in No. 5778, from Bombay Government, 30th November) submitted in detail the views of His Highness the Sultan on the question of a re-lease of the Bunder Abbass districts. He said:— “ The gist of His Highness* arguments seems to be that he would be very desirous of re-leasing the Bunder Abbass districts, provided he could do so on the terms accorded to the Ex-Sultan Syud Salem; provided, further, that the negotiation for the lease could be carried through without extravagant outlay at the Court of Persia; and provided, lastly, that, if prac ticable, the negotiation should be entirely in the hands of Colonel Pelly, or ‘ officer of similar rank, the Muscat Envoy being merely present for form's sake.* ” 190. Mr. Alison charged Mr. Hickson with a message to Sadr Azem, the Shah’s Prime Minister, with the view of renewing the subject of the lease of Bunder Abbass, and reported (15th December 1871) that the Sadr Azem’s lan guage Avas unfavourable, but (as requested in the despatch of the Government of India, No. 2148P., of 7th October 1871) hcAtmuld not omit any good opportunity of bringing this matter before the Shah’s Government. 191. To Mr. Dickson Sadr Azem said that he did not believe that the Shah meant strictly what his reply did literally convey. He entered into the early history of the question, recounting how previously an Agent of one of the Imams imprisoned a Persian Governor of Bunder Abbass for whose release Her Maj esty’s Government refused to intercede, and which was only obtained by a renewal of the lease. He said it would be humiliating to the Persian Government, who can perfectly maintain their country, to have to rent a posses sion to a family AAdio, after having professed their-allegiance to Persia, cast upon it the grossest indignity. Persia, he added, would always value England’s friendly advice and do her best to meet the wishes of Her Majesty’s Govern ment and would protect British traders: any Agent of the Imam would not be officially recognized, though he Avould be treated Avith proper respect. 192. Mr. Alison (dated 18th December 1871) had since heard officially and reported the appointment of Ahmed Shah, of Minab, to the Government of Bunder Abbass, in the room of Hajee Ahmed Khan aaIio has been dismissed. The Native Agent at Lingah reported (enclosure in Bombay Government letter No. 1031, dated 20th February 1872) of the intention to sell the landed property of Hajee Ahmed Khan (his horses having been sold already), who was still in confinement and under a guard. 13-3-72.

From subsequent correspondence,* it appeared that Commander Lod- * From Bombay, No. 1327 , dated sth der, Her Majesty’s Ship anchored off Sohar March 1872 , on 24th January 1872, and sent an officer to icquest the British subjects to come on hoard, who had been warned by Major Boss that they must be prepared to take the consequences of remaining on land. A repre sentative party of four went on board next day, and informed Commander Lodder that there were about 12 British traders at Sohar, and a few more at Saharn, all wishing to leave. As they could not be ready before four or five days, he promised that a vessel of war should return and embark them for Mus cat, where they wished to go; and, according to his letter of 2nd February to t From Bombay, No. 1655, dated isth Major Boss, he sent Commander Doughty with the March 1872. Magpie to call at Sohar and Saharn. t Commander Doughty offered the British subjects at Sohar and Saharn a passage to Muscat. Ibrahim being reported to be at Sohar and to have moved off inland. They were only willing to go if he would wait four days and receive their frieghts of corn, &amp;c., the only complaint made was at Saharn that Ibrahim had not paid for some rice bought. On 15th February Commander Doughty telegraphed the report at Muscat that Salim bin Thoweynee meditated a hostile landing at Sur. Toorkee had applied to Major Boss for the moral support of the presence of a ship of war, which the Political Agent thought would he for the general good. See § 158. No orders were issued. 195. In their No. 1424, dated 8th March 1872, the Bombay Government sent up two letters $ from Colonel Felly regarding * N0 i 87 i 1 , 9 wS , S e o 8 nr 1 i! h Se ^ mhQT the plunder of a native crafty and the imprisonment No. 1250 - 864 , dated 2ist November 0 f some British Indian subjects by Ibrahim bin i 87 i, with enclosures. Ghais at Sohar, and submitted their views. Major Boss reported to Colonel Pelly on 10th August 1871 that a small native bugareh laden with merchandize to the value of $1,600, the property of banyan traders, and bound from Muscat to Shinas, was seized by Syed Ibrahim’s orders, when passing within a few miles of the coast near Sohar ; that about $600 worth of the property was restored on the affair being represented to Syed Ibrahim bin Ghais; that his interference had been requested to obtain restitution of the remainder. Major Boss not feeling warranted to address Ibrahim direct, referred the matter to Syed Toorkee, who'communicated with Ibrahim. From the latter’s reply, it appeared that he was urged to take the property by the necessities of his posi tion at the time, and that he would compensate the owners. Subsequently Ibrahim wrote on the 12th September 1871 to Major Boss, and from the tone of his letter, it appeared that he meditated evading the restitution of the banyan’s property, on the ground that the provisions were being sent by Toorkee for his troops. On enquiry Major Boss was of opinion that the buglah was not fitted out with munitions of war, although it was admitted that there two of Toorkee’s followers on hoard. Major Boss did not answer Ibrahim, waiting to see what he would do. On 9th October Major Boss transmitted the deposition of a Khojah, mer chant of Khabooreh, brother of the men who were imprisoned by Ibrahim at Khabooreh. This deposition stated that “on 19th September 1871 Ibrahim bin Ghais of Sohar came to Khabooreh and demanded 30 bags of rice from his brother Hameyd. That Hameyd refused, unless on payment of ready money. That Ibrahim offered to pay afterwards, but that deponent, who was present, stated to Ibrahim that they had previously on two occasions given supplies to Azan and were not paid.( 64 ) That they were pressed by Ibrahim and refused to comply with his demand, stating to him they were under British protection, and not his subjects. That Ibrahim thrice repeated his demand and was thrice refused by Hameyd. That thereupon Ibrahim ordered Hameyd and Somwar and Dosa to be imprisoned and placed in irons. That they were at once imprisoned, and irons placed in their legs. That deponent was present and a witness of this; that many persons wit nessed this affair; that he, deponent, was not imprisoned; that his brothers Hameyd and Som war and Dosa were imprisoned, and put m irons on the 19th September, and on the 20th, about mid-day, were released. That no rice was taken from them, nor was any money taken. There was no doubt that the Khojahs were imprisoned, because they refused to meet Ibrahim’s demand for rice unless he paid; they claimed British Consu lar protection. At Colonel Belly’s suggestion Major Boss sent to Syed Toorkee a copy of the last letter he had received from Ibrahim, to which Toorkee replied “ I have received your letter regarding the plundering of certain banyans (British subjects) by Ibrahim. In my opinion the only way to obtain restoration of the property is for the Gov ernment (British) to demand the same under severe threats of coercion. My demands would be ineffectual without using force.” The Bombay Government were of opinion that, as we have recognized Toorkee as Sultan, we should do nothing that could bear the appearance of en tering into a negociation or apparent negociation with Ibrahim, and if the Sul tan was unable to inflict punishment or give redress, that we should do it ourselves. They accordingly recommended for consideration of Government of India that Colonel Belly be authorized, if he had satisfied himself of the truth of the complaint, to direct the Lynx to proceed to Sohar, and require the payment of double the value of the property taken by Ibrahim, and of such compensation as Colonel Belly should fix (say $200 each man) for the imprisonment of the traders entitled to British protection. 106. The Government of India issued orders to Government of Bombay. (No. 783B., dated 2nd April 1872.) “ Although the rule of Syed Toorkee over the Oman territories is far from effective, and he has in a measure recognized Ibrahim bin Ghais as in quasi-independent possession of Sohar, yet as the British Government has recognized .the succession of Syed Toorkee to the Muscat throne, it was undoubtedly correct to address him in the first place on the subject. As, how ever, he has admitted his inability to procure redress fi’om Ibrahim bin Ghais, His Excellency in Council sees no objection to a direct demand being made on the latter for redress on account of the imprisonment of the three British subjects, and the plunder of the boat. These acts were distinct violations of the rights secured to British subjects by Treaty ; the latter act, indeed, was one of piracy. “ While admitting the necessity for demanding compensation for the violated rights of British subjects, it appears to His Excellency in Council that in the present condition of Ibra- him's finances, it would be impossible for him to pay the amount proposed by the Bombay Government, and that by making a demand disproportionate to his means, the prospects of an amicable settlement will be lessened. After Colonel Belly has satisfied himself of the truth of the complaints preferred, and after he has heard and disposed of the allegation that the boat was carrying contraband of war, His Excellency in Council empowers him to demand the restoration of the plundered property or payment of its value together with 10 per cent, of the value in addition, as compensation to the owners; he is also empowered to demand compensa tion at the rate of $100 a head for the persons imprisoned. In case of a refusal to complv with these demands or to give such other satisfaction as Colonel Belly may think reasonable, Colonel Belly is authorized to bombard the town after giving the inhabitants 48 hours' notice of his intention to do so. All action in this matter should be taken promptly. “ Colonel Belly should be directed to proceed in the first instance to Muscat, and take thence with him to Sohar a responsible officer of His Highness Syed Toorkee, who will be useful both in negotiating an amicable settlement and in giving greater regularity to the retributive measures that will be necessary, should negotiation fail. I am not to conclude without communicating the regret of His Excellency in Council at the delay that has taken place in a case, where action ought to have been prompt and decided. The correspondence which took place in the months of September, October, and November, is not submitted to the Government of India till the following March, any action that may now be taken must neces sarily lose much of its effect through this delay.”Ivi ( 65 ) *? 197. See § 158. Syed Toorkee’s object in going to Soor was to intercept bis nephew Syed Salim (but be escaped to Jaalan S. 159B.) after an interview with Ibrahim at Sohar and landing at Kalhat, accompanied by bis brother Syed Hareb and a few followers. Syed Toorkee returned to Muscat on 29th February, and Her Majesty’s Ship Lynx arrived there on 1st March. (From Bombay, No. 1541, dated 13th March.) 198. On 19th March the Bombay Government telegraphed:— “ Following 1 from Colonel Felly :— f I have received the subjoined from Major Ross, Mus cat, 16th.—Syed Salim at Bedeeya, his following increasing, dangerous combination of, Hina wee class developing. An advance upon Muscat probable with concerted action, but how soon is uncertain. Presence of vessels desirable, but no great hurryJ Telegram ends. I propose proceeding to Muscat in Kwantung; other reports are to effect that Sultan is desponding and quite without funds/ ” On 30th March Syed Toorkee was said to think well of his affairs, but to be very anxious for the Zanzibar subsidy. The Bombay Government suggested the importance of making a loan to Syed Toorkee of such amounts to be repaid when the subsidy should be restored. (No. 1967, dated 3rd April 1872.) The Government of India adhered to its former decision of 11th March 1872. See § 159B. 199. On 24th April 1872 the Bombay Government sent two telegrams:— “ Following from Colonel Felly :—‘ Sultan of Muscat amicably arranged matters at Semgzil (Semayel) and returned to Muscat. Conspiracy against His Highness^ rule seems widely spread. Ibrahim bin Ghais in communication with Syed bin Salim, who has written to Political Agent intimating his intention to move on Muscat. Both sides pretend to be confident. Salim reported to be awaiting funds from Zanzibar/ ” “ Following from Colonel Felly :— c Demands at Sohar complied with by Ibrahim bin Ghais with difficulty. Ibrahim took Shinas simultaneously with my arrival at Sohar, and is besieging Lawa. He urgently requests that both parties in present civil strife may be prohibited operat ing by sea, as was the case when Syed Toorkee was opposing Azan’s Government.” These were the demauds referred to in § 196. This compliance was consi dered satisfactory. The Bombay letter No. 2418, dated 24th April, showed that Syed Toorkee went with a force of Ghafiree tribes to Semayel in order to coerce a refractory tribe. The Political Agent arrived at Muscat on the 7th April in the Kwantwng. Communication with the south-eastern districts was cut off owing to the disturbing presence of Salim. The Bullfinch anchored at Muscat on 14th April. 200. The Secretary noted on Ibrahim’s request, that both sides should be prohibited from operations by sea, that there seejned to be no necessity for making any communication to him at all adding— “ we have acknowledged Toorkee as ruler of Muscat, and there is no reason whv we should acknowledge Ibrahim as a belligerent or hold any communication with him as to the manner in which Syed Toorkee may see fit to endeavour to assert his authority. Toorkee, however, seems in a bad way. “No orders needed.” 201. On 1st May 1872 Bombay Government has telegraphed:— “ Following from Colonel Felly :— f Have received from Major Ross subjoined telegram.

While Toorkee has failed to consolidate his power hy force of arms, his antagonists have been unable to effect a successful coalition against his authority. The want of money debarred all parties from operations of any magnitude: Syud Salim bin Thoweynee failed in his efforts to obtain funds from Zanzibar ; Toorkee applied repeatedly and ineffectually for the restoration of the subsidy. The coalition attempted between Ibrahim bin Ghes and Syud Salim iu April 1872, when the former was to act in the north and the latter in the south, resulted in nothing through Ibrahim’s defeat near Lawa and Salim’s failure to raise the country. The departure of Salim for Bombay in December 1872 relieved the Sultan for a time of the presence of an intriguing rival. The assumption by the Govt, of India of the direct control of political relations with the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, &amp;c., and consequently of the appointments in those regions, was effected in January 1873 on the proposal of the Bombay Govt. 203. Persian Gulf Politics . —The Secretary of State forwarded in February 1872 letters from Commander Doughty of the Magpie and Bear Admiral Cockburn, respecting the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf, and the Turkish expedition to Nejd. Commander Doughty propounded his views of the causes which were then (November 1871) inducing the Turks to turn their attention to the Persian Gulf and the Bed Sea under the mask of quieting feuds in Arabia. Admiral Cockburn urged the advisability of sending another vessel to the Gulf, as the Govt, of India had required three vessels to be continually stationed there. A return of the Turkish vessels in the Persian Gulf showed a strong squadron of seven ships of war, two other 18 gun corvettes being on their way out. The Govt, of India did not answer this despatch. The Secretary noted on the papers thus— “ I do not suppose the Secretary of State expects any expression of the views of the Govt, of India on Commander Doughty’s exposition of Gulf politics. Govt, have already written fully and repeatedly to state to the Secretary of State their objections to the presence of a large Turkish force in the Gulf, and I don’t see that any further writing will do any good. It might, perhaps, be enough to acknowledge this despatch, refer to our various letters, and tell the Secretary of State that it would be well to send an early answer. “ There is a very great deal that is both suggestive and true in Commander Doughty’s letter. It is generally understood that, since we threw the Turks over in the Black Sea affair, they are on far better terms with Russia than they ever were before. Whatever may be their ultimate object, it is beyond dispute that the Turks have, within the last two years, shown every disposition to extend their authority in Arabia and in the Persian Gulf both by sea and land'. Perhaps it is inevitable ; and possibly the time has gone bye for the maintenance of our exclusive authority in the Gulf. I hope not; but it looks very like it, and it cei'tainly will be the case if the Secretary of State leaves our numerous despatches on Gulf politics much longer unanswered. But however that may be, I think the opening of the Suez Canal has made it ten times more our interest to be on good and intimate terms with Turkey than it ever was before, and the course taken in the Black Sea discussions is much to be regretted so far as the interests of India are concerned. Turkey is a far more valuable ally than Persia, who is, and will continue to be, under the thumb of Russia. We can hardly expect to compete successfully with Russia for influence in Persian counsels. \\ hen General Goldsmid was in Calcutta he told me that the Shah did not take a single step in the discussions about the Mekran boundary without consulting the Russian Minister. u Now that the overland carrying trade from China has been ruined by the opening of the canal, I look upon it as a matter of certainty that the Russians will sooner or later have a part in the Persian Gulf for their commerce. We shall then be brought face to face with bigger questions than have arisen during the Nejd campaign, and it is of the utmost importance, before that event occurs, that our position in the Gulf should be put on a well recognized and sound footing, and all causes of irritation with Turkey and Persia removed. If the discussions 1with these powers are ever to be amicably settled, and what is more important, settled in our favor, it must be now. It will never be done if we put off till some other European power has established itself in the Gulf.” \_PTogs., Secret, July 1872, Nos. 120-122.] 204. state of parties in April 1872 —The situation in Oman (see Section 159A) appeared on 23rd March so menacing, owing to Salim’s presence at Bideeya with Shiekh Saleh, and the possibility of his advance upon Muscat with the support of the Hinavees, that Major Itoss thought Colonel Felly’s presence at Muscat desirable, where he was allowed to proceed by the Bombay Govt. From there the Political Besident gave on 13th April a succinct statement of the position of parties. Salim was intriguing at Bideeyah, Sheikh Saleh scheming and waiting his opportunity at Ibra ; Ibrahim bin Ghes intriguing and raiding near Sohar; Fysul bin Hamood in possession of Rostak, and the Aboothabee Chief besieging Beraymee. Toorkee held Soor and Muscat with a few miles of country round with a force of about 3,000 or 4,000 men, chiefly Ghafirees, but could not take a deeded step from want of money. Though hemming him in on every side his enemies had no cohesion or combination, each watching the chance to strike a blow' for himself only. Colonel Felly thought the result might be to disintegrate the Sultanat and break it up into sections, perhaps into numerous Sheikhdoms. Eventually Toorkee marched on 8th April into the Semayel valley to punish the Beni Rooaheh tribe for the murder of Mahomed bin Saeed, a Chief of the Al-boo- Saeed, a murder alleged to have been perpetrated in revenge for Toorkee’s proceedings in the imprisonment and death of Khuleelee (see Section 117). Though Toorkee’s forces w r ere augmented by the junction of many of the Ghafiree tribes, yet on hearing of the coalition between Salim and Sheikh Saleh (the latter to assist the Beni Rooaheh and the former to march on Muscat) he retired hastily after a meeting with some of the Beni Rooaheh to save appear ances. With this result the Ghafirees were discontented, but Toorkee’s advisers thought their disaffection opened the w r ay for a reconciliation with the Hinavees, while Salim was attempting to gain over the Ghafirees. The Govt, of India had no orders to issue on receipt of this information, which w r as duly commu nicated to the Secretary of State. [Progs., Poltl. A., July 1872, Nos. 238-250.] 205. Interference of Turkish Consul-Genei al at Bombay with Muscat vessels. —a complaint having been made by the Muscat Govt, in 1871 that the Turkish Consul-General at Bombay was in the habit of interfering with vessels coming from the Oman and Muscat coasts to Bombay, it appeared in May 1872, after careful enquiry, that the complaint was unfounded, as the requisition of the Turkish Consul-General only extended to all vessels that arrived at Bombay sailing‘under the Turkish flag. Ts T o complaint had been made to the Customs authorities that the Turkish Consul-General had at any time interfered with vessels sailing under 'Muscat colours. Accordingly no notice was taken of the complaint. [Progs., Poltl. A., June 1872, No. 6(h] 206. Redress demanded from Ibrahim bin Ghes at Sohar.— Colo nel Felly’s proceedings at Sohar in demanding redress for the violation of the rights of British subjects by Ibrahim bin Ghes in obedience to the orders of the Govt, of India (see Sections 196 and 199 of Precis) were duly reported. On his arrival on 16th April at Sohar, Ibrahim was absent at Lawa or Shinas. He took the evidence of the British subjects as to their losses (which they stated at Rupees 2,255), and after intimating to Ibrahim’s deputies that their Chief had had ample time to return from Lawa, he warned the inhabitants to remove within 48 hours, and threatened bombardment, unless the demands for redress w'ere satisfied within that time. Ibrahim returned on the 18th, and at once sent deputies to confer with Colonel Felly on the Quangtung, who, after the days of grace allowed, brought a letter from Ibrahim fulfilling his engagement to conform to the demands 2made upon him, and promising good behaviour for the future. They paid half the claims, viz., $1,127^, and gave a bond for the remaining half, the cash having been raised with difficulty. Colonel Felly’s proceedings were approved by the Govt, of India, as being in accordance with the instructions issued by Govt, in their despatch No. 783P., dated 2nd April 1872, and the payment by Ibrahim of the full balance due on the bond was telegraphed by the Bombay Govt, on the 20th July.

Position of affaitsinMay 1872—Syud Salim bin Thoweynee wrote on 9th April to Major Moss of his intention to advance on Muscat, but subsequent news showed that he had been repulsed in his attempt on Soor and forced to retire to Jaalan. Ibrahim bin Ghes also, who had taken Shinas and was besieging Lawa, suffered a defeat from Toorkee’s Commander, Bedr bin Seyf, but himself escaped to Sohar. The fort of Lawa was thus relieved, and Shinas and Majees retaken. Colonel Felly, writing on the 18th of May, doubted whether the check to the Bin Ghes faction would be permanent, as, 1st, Ibrahim represented the party who looked to dividing the Muscat Sultanate into two portions, viz., Muscat and Sohar, and obtaining the Sohar division for the Bin Ghes branch; 2nd, Ibrahim represented what might he called the Arabian conservative policy of the inland tribes as distinguished from the advanced and free thought line of the seaboard ports. The inland or Bedowin party seek strictness in morals and religion, and -desire a spiritual leader, an Imam, rather than a temporal Sultan, while they regard the policy of the reigning branch as too subordinate to that of foreigners in temporal affairs and as tending towards infidelity in spiritual concerns.

Question of preventing all hostile operations at Sea in Per sian Gulf and Sea &lt; f Oman—On the 27th May 1872 the Bombay Govern ment enquired of the Government of India by telegram “ whether the ordinary policy of preventing all hostile operations at sea is to be maintained in the present civil strife in Oman.” Ibrahim bin Ghes had taken Shinas and had besieged Lawa with a gun sent by sea from Sohar, and had urgently requested that both sides might be pro hibited from operating by sea, as was the case when Syud Toorkee was oppos ing Azan’s Government. The Government of India replied (No. 1284P., dated 8th June 1872) to Bombay:— “ Instruct Felly not to interfere with operations by sea outside Persian Gulf between the con tending parties in Muscat. Communications from Ibrahim and other recusants cannot be answered. We have recognized Toorkee, and for present at least communications on questions of this kind should only be with him. Felly need not address Toorkee regarding our resolu tion not to interfere unless Toorkee appeal to him.” Aud at the same time our despatch No. 13, dated 3rd April 1871 (Sec. 163 of Precis) was declared to be the guide as to policy in the Gulf of Oman. [Progs., Secret, June 1872, Nos. 156-159.] 209. Views of the Government of India thereon.— The views of the Government of India were fully stated to the Bombay Government thus:— “ The first active interference of the British Telegram from the Govt, of Bombay, dated 5th Dee. 1868.

The origir Government to prevent hostilities in the Gulf of Oman is of very recent date, and it arose out of circumstances described in the correspondence noted in the margin. Government were drawn into it almost insensibly from having taken a more direct and immediate interest in the domestic politics and dynastic changes in Muscat than His Excellency in Council was subse- d instructions of 11th December 1868 and28th January 1869 were modified by those of 4th August 1869. But the position which was assumed even under these modified instructions was dis- * Enclosure to letter from Bombay, tasteful to the Ruler of Muscat, Azan bin Ghes, who, in a No. 35, dated 3rd February 1870. letter dated 16th I)ecember 1869,* and addressed to Colo nel Felly, remonstrated against our interference with his proceedings at sea. « O n the accession of Syud Toorkee, His Excellency in Council deemed it advisable, without making any declaration of a marked change of policy, to take the opportunity gra dually to recede from a position which was liable at any moment to involve Government in very serious complications. Accordingly, in my telegram of 20th May 1871, you were informed that f there need be no restriction on Syud TooiWs desire to send men by sea along the coast to take possession of Sohar;' and in paragraph 4 of my letter, No'. 2537P., dated 7th December 1871, it was stated that f His Excellency m Council has no desire to prevent Syud Toorkee from putting to sea with a view to establish his authority in any part of his dominions that may be situated outside the Persian Gulf. “ It will of course be the duty of the Political Agent to take all necessary measures for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects, and also by advice and personal influence, as far as possible, to maintain peace in the Gulf of Oman. But His Excellency m Council does not desire that any attempt should be made by force, or show of it, to inteifere with hostile operations which the contending parties in Oman may undertake against each other by sea outside the Persian Gulf. As you are aware, our position in the Peisian Gulf stands on a different footing to which these instructions do not apply.” [Progs., Secret, June 1872, Nos. 150-161.] 210. Refusal to aid Syud Toorkee.— On 31st May the Bombay Gov ernment reported that Toorkee’s factotum, Thoweynee, had applied on 20th April to Colonel Felly to have one of his ships laden with reinforcements towed up the coast to Sohar or Lawa as the wind was contrary, to which request Colonel Felly refused to listen, on the ground of want of authority oyer the Quangtung or to interfere in the intestine commotions of the Muscat State. The Bombay Government and the Government of India approved of Colonel Felly’s proceedings. [Progs., Poltl. A., June 1872, Nos. 207-211.] 211. Mediation between Toorkee and Salim proposed and post poned; application for Zanzibar subsidy- —On 10th June Colonel Felly telegraphed:— « Political Agent reports that Sultan of Muscat earnestly desires any form of our media tion as between him and Syud Salim in view to relieving Sultan of cost entailed on him by Syud Salim's presence. Mediation would be difficult, but might be tried if Government approve.” Upon which the Government of India called for a report on what basis Colonel Felly would propose to mediate between Toorkee and Salim. » Colonel Felly replied :— “ The basis consistent with integrity of Sultanat would be pension to Salim on condition of not molesting Muscat territory, but I doubt Sultan’s present finances being capable of pay ing adequate pension; if Sultan receive Zanzibar subsidy, he might perhaps expel Salim as sub mitted. I think mediation difficult, and represented it only on Sultan’s urgent application. I proceed on leave to Bombay and Simla in few days, and if desired, might then more fully explain details.” The Government of India allowed the matter to stand over till Colonel Felly came to Simla. [Progs., Poltl. A., June 1872, Nos. 592-601, and Progs., December 1872, No. 664.] On 12th June Colonel Felly telegraphed that Toorkee wrote most earnestly praying for Zanzibar subsidy, as the Arabs were constantly demand ing money, and were discontented at refusal. Toorkee was convinced he would have to give up the government of Muscat unless he could obtain funds. The Government of India sent this telegram to the Secretary of State with an inti mation that their views had been repeatedly given, and that it was most desir able the subsidy question should be settled one way or the other.

Abdool Azeez declines maintenance from Toorkee.— On June 6th Abdool Azeez wrote to the Governor of Bombay, declining to accept any thing in the shape of maintenance from his brother, Toorkee, although the latter had agreed to pay him $ 200 per mensem on condition of his residing in India or at Zanzibar. [Progs., Poltl. A., July 1872, Nos. 292-293.] 213. Situation in Oman in June 1872. Application by Ibrahim bin Giles. —On the 12th June the situation in Oman was unchanged. Salim being still at Bideeyah, and Ibrahim still urging the disaffected to rebel in the south-east: the arrival from Zanzibar of Syud Hamad bin Salim, formerly Wullee of Mesnaah (cousin of Toorkee and uncle of Salim), was expected to influence local politics. On 18th another application was received by Colonel Belly from Ibrahim that permission might be given to all, or all be prohibited alike from carrying on hostilities at sea. Colonel Belly, acting on the telegram of 8th June from the Government of India (see section 208), did not reply to Ibrahim. [Progs., Poltl. A., July 1872, Nos. 386-395.] 214. Toorkee receives $ 5,000 from Zanzibar Sultan. —On 13th June Major Ross reported that Sheikh Syud bin Hamad Mulkhee had brought to Toorkee $ 5,000 from Syud Burgash of Zanzibar, but that Toorkee having expected at least $ 20,000 was most dissatisfied and annoyed at the smallness of the sum and meant again to address Government on the subject of his claim on Zanzibar. This was communicated to the Secretary of State. [Progs., Poltl., A., August 1872, Nos. 316-349.] 215. Syud Salim without a following— On 27th June Major Ross wrote that Syud Salim had no following. The Sheikh of the Beniboo Ali tribe on returning from Mecca invited him to their settlement in Jaalan, in reply to which he asked them to Bideeya where he was residing, but they declined as Bideeya was inhabited by Ilinavees. [JDesp. to Secy, of State, No. 178, dated 2Qth August 1872.] 216. Toorkee’s application about Zanzibar. —On the 14th August Colonel Belly telegraphed again *through the Bombay Government that the Muscat territories were tranquil throughout, and the Sultan inquisitive con cerning Charbar and Zanzibar subsidy, apparently desirous, if the subsidy Should be withdrawn, that restrictions of arbitrament as to interference with Zanzibar should be also withdrawn. The Secretary upon this wrote the following note:— “ Government have so repeatedly urged the necessity of paying the Zanzibar subsidy, not only on grounds of good faith, but in the interests of Muscat, which depends on that money for the maintenance of a settled government, that nothing further can be urged in any fresh repre sentations to the Secretary of State on the subject. The fact is that the Home Government are in a dilemma. The payment of the subsidy by Zanzibar has been urged so forcibly by the Gov ernment of India that the arguments can hardly be ignored, or the strong opinion of the Indian Government set aside. On the other hand, the Sultan of Zanzibar (the predecessor of the pre sent Sultan) was informed by the Political Agent, by order of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, that the payment of the subsidy to Muscat would not in future be required of him. The con sequence is that, although the question has been pending for years, the Home Government delay their decision; the delay adds enormously to the difficulty of reviving the payment, and becomes in fact an additional argument for non-payment. The practical result will probably be that the arrangements made by Lord Canning will become a dead-letter. However deplor able this result may be, the Government of India have done their best to prevent it and are helpless to do more. “ fl'it it is not fair to Muscat that the question should remain in this condition. If the subsidy is not to be renewed, it is only fair and just to tell her so plainly and leave her free to take her own measures. The present telegram gives an opportunity of so doing, if the Secre tary of State be disposed. It may be telegraphed to the Secretary of State, with the remark that a decision on the subsidy question, one way or the other, becomes daily more pressing, and it is hardly fair to Muscat that the decision should be delayed.”6 The Viceroy wrote privately to the Secretary of State. [Progs., Poltl. A., August 1872, No. 425.] 217. Situation in Oman in July and August 1872—All July Oman remained apparently trancjuil. loorkee received se^eial 'visits fioni Bedouin tribes, who came to obtain donations, hut was much embarrassed to find means to satisfy them. Syud Salim was still quite powerless at Bideeyah, and was said to he keeping up communications with the bin Ghes family. The hurricane at Zanzibar was ascribed as the cause of his mother failing to raise money to aid him to rebel. Colonel Boss was told that Toorkee’s Agent at Bombay advised an Envoy on deputation being sent to Bombay about the Zanzibar subsidy, and his opinion was asked. He replied that he did not think the step necessary. Colonel Belly informed Colonel Boss that the Zanzibar subsidy question was fully before* Government; that a deputation would do no good, and would cost a sum which Toorkee could ill afford. On the 15th August Colonel Boss wrote of reports from the south-eastern districts that Sheikh Saleh-el-Harithi was trying to organize a party against Toorkee, who, however, had no apprehensions. The communications were still open. [K.-TF. Progs., Poltl. A., September 1872, Nos. 1-6.] Towards the end of August Salim left Bideeya, hut was deserted by his followers and had to return; the Muscat Government exhibited no uneasiness, as Toorkee was able to muster some 400 or 500 fighting men, even some of the Hinavees, the opposite faction, having offered to join him. [Progs., Poltl. A., September 1873, Nos, 1-6 and 148-150, and October, Nos. 331-338.] 218. Colonel Boss’s Beport and map of the tribes in Oman,—In September 1872 the Bombay Government forwarded a memorandum drawn up by Colonel Boss, the Political Agent, Muscat, on the tribal divisions in Oman, with a table of the tribes, a map showing the general distribution of the tribes, and a genealogical tree of the descendants of the Imam Ahmed Al-bu-Saidi (the latter is fuller than the one given at page 407 of the Bev. G. P. Badger’s “ Imams and Syuds of Oman”). He traced the origin in the beginning of the 18th century of the classification of the tribes into the two great divisions of Hinavees and Ghafirees, and described the modern history of Oman as mainly the narrative of the contentions between these great rival factions. The majo rity of the Hinavees follow the Ibadhi sect, whilst the opposite faction are mostly orthodox. Colonel Boss was thanked for these valuable contributions towards the history and geography of Oman. [Progs., Poltl. A. September. 1872, Nos. 195-198.] 219. Stipend of Syud Toorkee while at Bombay. —In September 1872 the Government of India sanctioned the sum of Bupees 22,850, the balance of advances made to Syud Toorkee on account of stipend while in Bombay, being treated as a bad debt, and written off: these advances were repayable from the Zanzibar subsidy. When Syud Toorkee was deported to Bombay on the 10th September 1867, it was arranged that he should receive $600, i.e., about Bupees 1,500 per men sem from Syud Salim, the then Sultan, conditionally on his residing in Bri tish India. In May 1868 he sought for an addition to this allowance on the ground of its insufficiency, but seeing that the stipend was more than one-sixth of the Zanzibar subsidy of 40,000 Crowns to Muscat, out of which it was met, and seeing also that the Sultan of Muscat was in great need of money himself, the Government of India refused to entertain his application.Notwithstanding the fact that Syud Toorkee was granted this allowance by the Sultan of Muscat, yet it was paid to him through the Bombay Govern ment. This happened in this wise. So as * to meet the wishes of Syud Majeed bin Saeed, the Sultan of Zanzi bar, who considered it derogatory to his dignity to pay any subsidy to Syud Salim, the Government of India in December 1867 consented to allow the Bombay Government to receive the subsidy from time to time and pay the amount to the Muscat State. On the 6th of May 1868 the arrears then due on account of the above subsidy, viz., Bupees 1,68,000, were paid f into the Bombay General Treasury; since that date not a dollar was sent to Bombay either by Syud Saeed, the late, or Syud Burgash, the present, Buler of Zanzibar. The Bombay Government drew attention to this, and solicited instructions as to the adjustment of the out standing sum of Rupees 22,850, probably that advanced between the 6th May 1868 and March 1870 when Toorkee left Bombay. (See Sec. 72 of this Precis ) [Pm/s., Poltl. A., September 1872, Nos. 218-220.] 220- Renewed application by Ibrahim bin Ghes— Ibrahim bin Ghes again applied in July to Colonel Felly for information as to whether the British Government would forbid, or permit, operations by sea on the coast of Oman, and asked that both sides might be prohibited from acting by sea and confined to operations by land. Colonel Felly requested instructions as to whe ther he was at liberty to notify publicly or otherwise intimate to Ibrahim bin Ghps the views of the Government of India set forth in their No. 1304P., ated 11th June 1872 (Sec. 209). The Government of India referred the Bombay Government to that letter as clearly indicating the course to be adopted by Colonel Felly towards Syud Toorkee and those who refused to acknowledge his authority in Oman. The Bombay Government not being satisfied that this reference of the Government of India to former orders disposed of Colonel Felly’s question, again applied, and were told on 31st October that there was no necessity to notify publicly the views of Government in the matter, as such a course would be a direct encouragement to rebels to commence hostilities by sea, and Syud Toorkee might with good reason complain : the line of policy laid down on 11th June was to be adopted.

Engagement of March 1862 between England and France to respect independence of Muscat and Zanzibar— In August 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded to the Government of India a copy of the engage ment entered into on 10th March 1862 between England and France, by which both powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. This was as follows :— “ Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Majesty the Emperor of the French, taking into consideration the importance of maintaining the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to respect the independence of these Sovereigns. “ The undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipoten tiary at the Court of France, and the Minister Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor of the French, being furnished with the necessary powers, hereby declare in consequence that their said Majesties take reciprocally that engagement. * Zanzibar Precis, paragraphs 35-36. f Progs., Poltl A., Jane 1868, Nos. 32-34.t • “ Witness whereof the undersigned have signed the present declaration^ and have affixed thereto the seals of their arms. “Done at Paris, the 10th March 1862. “ (Sd.)

Renewed application by Toorkee for Zanzibar subsidy — Toorkee never failed to enquire from Colonel Ross on kis visits whether there was any news about the Zanzibar subsidy, and on one occasion asked the Poli tical Agent for advice as to the propriety of addressing the Viceroy and the Governor of Bombay, on the subject of the subsidy, letters which in addition to the usual respectful solicitations contained a request that in case his solicita tions were not complied with the restrictions which the arbitration judgment imposed in reference to the claims of the Ruler of Muscat on Zanzibar should be withdrawn. Colonel Ross advised him to defer further communications on the subject, as his^former representations were before Government. To a question of the Sultan’s as to what decision was arrived at about Charhar, Colonel Ross replied that he had no information. Colonel Felly approved of Colonel Ross’s replies. The Political Agent, Zanzibar, also transmitted a letter from Toorkee to Syud Burgash, in which the former, for the first time, claimed the subsidv as a thing to be paid at once on the alternative of a rupture between Zanzibar and Muscat. The Government of India, in October, on receipt of these papers saw no objection to Colonel Felly’s informing Toorkee with respect to Charbar that Government could not interfere in the matter, and that he was quite at liberty to take any measures he thought proper in respect to it. In reporting the papers to the Secretary of State, he was apprized of the anxiety caused to the Government of India by the continued non-receipt of instructions on the Zanzibar subsidy question, f Proas., Poltl A Non pm her 1872, Nos. 82-91.] l ^ ivovem- 223. Tenets of the Ibadhi sect of Oman— In October 1872 the Bom- • 0Vei l U11 i e ^ t submitted a P a Per giving an account of the tenets of the Ibadin sect ol Oman, translated from an Arabic manuscript work bv Colonel Ross, Political Agent, Muscat, for which and for his preface he received the tbe Government of India. [Progs., Poltl. A., December 1872 Nos. 4UU-4j0o.J J $24. Situation in Oman from September to November 1872.— The Muscat news from September to November was as follows: r . . R “ ss on t bo 19th September 1872 reported that the Aboothabee Chief, Sheikh Saeed bin Khalifah, was still at Muscat, and had informed him that he had received a letter from some Turkish authority couched in vicmo terms, which he understood to be an invitation to recognize the Turkish Government as the paramount authority. (The change in the policy of the Aboothabee Chief was notified by the Residency Moonshee at Bahrein *on 11th September 1872. He was previously inclined towards the Turks and commu nicated with them, hut on hearing of their proceedings in Kateef, Gutter and 8 I \'.Si Lahsa, he kept aloof and determined to make peace first with the Chief •of Dehaye and then proceed to Muscat to renew friendly relations with Syud Toorkee.) Toorkee himself reported to Colonel Pelly the submission of the Abootha- bee Chief and the renewal of friendship, and that bygones would he bygones. Colonel Pelly replied suitably. The Aboothabee Chief unsuccessfully offered his good offices between Toorkee and Salim, and Colonel Itoss wrote that proposals for some settlement between these two was being mooted by the Ilinavee tribes of the south; that Toorkee was willing to make an allowance to his nephew, but the tribes wished the latter to reside in Oman. In conversation Syud Saeed-bin Mahomed Suliman told Colonel Itoss that the last letter received by Toorkee from the Sultan of Zanzibar was very unfa vorable with regard to hopes of pecuniary assistance from that quarter, and that without the aid from Zanzibar they would be powerless to act offensively, i.e.) to put down a rising. Colonel Pelly went to Muscat and saw Toorkee, who was very frank, and spoke of Ibrahim-bin Ghes as ruling in Ids own country at and around Sohar (where he had been settled some time). Toorkee regarded the quelling of Ibrahim’s rebellion as a question of money; if he received the Zanzibar subsidy or other funds, he would dispose of Ibrahim’s pretensions, otherwise matters would remain in statu quo. Toorkee Avas aware that Salim was at Shargah in communication with Sheikkr Saleh (the most active and intriguing member in the Government of zan bin Ghes), but could not admit his pretensions, as he demanded $600 per mensem with permission to reside in Muscat territory. He considered Syud Fysul, ruling at Rostak, a religious candidate for power, to be more likely to succeed than Ibrahim, though lately discomfited at the hands of the Beni Ryan tribe. With regard to Zanzibar, Toorkee desired either that he should be paid the arrears of subsidy and continue to receive it annually, or, that failing this, the British Government should permit him to seize Zanzibar. Colonel Pelly pointed out to Toorkee how illogical it was of him, while admitting his inability to quell a local revolt without cash, to be demanding permission to conquer an Independent State without the subsidy. 'When it was explained that other means, not force; would be used to conquer Zanzibar, Colonel Pelly reminded Toorkee of Lord Canning’s arbitration. As to Abdool Azeez (his brother), Toorkee was not satisfied that he would desist from further endeavours to disturb the peace, but expressed his willing ness still to allow Abdool Azeez $200 per mensem, on condition of residing out of Muscat territories, and desisting from interference. On the 3rd October the Chief of Aboothabee was still at Muscat, but was expected to leave daily. Toorkee had given him $2,500, which, with the daily expense of keeping him (nearly $150), had compelled resort to various expedi ents to raise ready money, such as buying rice on credit and selling it for cash at a loss. In his letter of 5th October, Colonel Pelly doubted little that Toorkee’s Government had from the first been one of sufferance, and one quite unable to withstand the tribes of Oman, though there was no reason to suppose it was weaker than at any previous date since the commencement of his rule. On the 26th October Colonel Ross reported a raid made by Syud Salim on the seaport village of Karriyat, with 14 men of the tribe, El-Hijreen, in which 16 camels of Toorkee’s were driven off and the Wullee of Karriyat wounded. Salim decamped before the arrival of Toorkee’s Wahabee guard, and medi tated a dash on Soor, but the inhabitants were on the alert, and Salim retired inland and back to Bideeva. c• Even Salim’s supposed friends disapproved of this petty robbery. ^ Mutual distrust was said chiefly to bar any settlement between Salim and Toorkee, though there w*as reason to believe that mediation would not be unacceptable. Colonel Felly asked for instructions whether good offices should be given in view to mediating between Toorkee and Salim, dhe camels taken by Salim had not been surrendered by the 9th November. After three months c]uit t residence at Sohar, Ibrahim had assumed the role of a zealous religionist, wear ing the white turban of the Mettowa and fasting; as the character was foreign to'his real nature, Colonel Ross inferred he had political motives. On 10th November Colonel Ross heard that Ibrahim had taken possession of Khahooreh with its small fort, and subsequently Colonel Ross wrote that Toorkee had been unable to attack Ibrahim for want of funds, but had sent a small reinforcement to Soweyk, on which an attack was apprehended. Ibrahim was said to he too weak to extend his operations; he returned to Sohar leaving a guard to hold Khabooreh, which Toorkee would not be able to reoccupy immediatelv. Toorkee was unable to send money even for the purpose of an attack on Sohar during Ibrahim’s absence. [Pro^s., Poltl. A., January 1873, Nos. 256-288.] 225. Transfer of Political relations with Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, &amp;c., from Government of Bombay to Government of India— On the 30th December 1872 the Bombay Government submitted a proposal to transfer, to the direct control of the Government of India, political relations with the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, and the tribes beyond the western frontier of Sind. They wrote:— “ The correspondence carried on between the Bombay Government and these territories consists in part of unimportant communications, copies of which are transmitted by post to the Foreign Office, and partly of more momentous and complicated questions which can only be considered in connection with the general foreign policy of the Indian Government. In the case of the former no advantage is gained from the additional labour of recording copies, whilst in the case of the more emergent and serious business a reference to the Government of India is generally necessary, and with the facilities afforded by improved communication by railway and the telegraph this reference might advantageously in the first instance be made direct. “The Honble the Governor in Council-is, therefore, of opinion that it will both be more satisfactory to the Government of India, and also tend to facilitate the conduct of business, if the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Zanzibar be directed in future to communicate upon all matters direct to the Government of India through the Foreign Depart ment. But at the same time, in order to guard against any possible contingencies, His Excel lency would be inclined to recommend the submission to this Government of occasional sum maries of intelligence, and, if necessary, the direct communication to the Political Department of any matters of special importance. “ With reference to Sind, however, a distinction must be drawn, as long as that province remains an integral part of the administration of this Presidency, between questions of purely foreign policy in connection with Beloochistan and the Trans-Indus tribes along the frontier, and those cases in which the interests of our own subjects are directly and specially involved. The former should, in His Excellency's opinion, be treated in the same manner as that proposed in the preceding paragraph, whilst in the case of the latter the Commissioner should continue to report direct to this Government acting upon their instructions ad interim, and leaving the final arrangements to be made by the local Government in communication with the Government of India. “ Should His Excellency the Governor-General in Council approve of this plan, I am desired to request that the necessary notification, under the provisions of the Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradition Act, and the other instructions necessary, may be issued as soon as convenient. “ His Excellency the Governor in Council is sensible that in relinquishing the control of affairs in the territories enumerated above, this Government will at the same time surrender the right of appointment to certain offices which have hitherto been held by members of the Bombay civil and military services. But it is hoped that the change will not in the main prove injurious to them. The Government of India is the Government of every Presidency and territory in British India, and the Government of Bombay cannot doubt that the claims of its servants to their just share of general patronage and promotion wall be fairly recognized and acted upon. ” 10 * -s* *11 In reply the Government of India wrote thus:— “The views expressed by His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council are in entire accordance with those of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, and tiie proposals made in your letter under acknowledgment are fully approved and sanctioned, subject to the confirmation of the Secretary of State. “ In order, however, that the Government of Bombay may be fully informed of events in connection with the Persian Gulf and Zanzibar, and more particularly with Beloochistan and Khelat, which may have a bearing more or less direct on the interests of the Bombay Presi dency, the Ilesident at Bushire, the Political Agent at Zanzibar, and the Commissioner in Sind will be directed for the present to send to the Bombay Government, for information, copies of all communications they address to the Government of India, and a copy of any replies that may be sent, or orders that may be issued, will also be furnished to you from this Office. Should His Excellency the Governor at any time desire to submit any remarks or proposals on any of the papers forwarded to him, the Governor-General in Council will be glad to receive them, and it will be optional with the Bombay Government at any time to request the discontinuance of the supply of copies of papers which they may not desire to place on their records. “The appointments in the Persian Gulf and at Muscat and Zanzibar will in future be made by the Government of India. But with respect to Khelat and Gwadur, which are to continue subordinate to the Commissioner in Sind, it will probably be better that the appointments should continue, for the present at least, to be. made by His Excellency the Governor of Bom bay, subject to reconsideration hereafter, if experince shows a change to be desirable. “With reference to paragraph 6 of your letter. His Excellency the Governor-General in Council desires me to state that the claims of the members of the Bombay civil and military services in respect to the appointments now transferred to the Government of India will always receive full and fair consideration, and that in his opinion the prospects of the Bombay officers will rather be improved than otherwise by the amalgamation of the appointments in the Persian Gulf and at Zanzibar with the political service directly under the Government o£_-I«dia.” Copies of this correspondence were sent to the Political Agent, Zanzibar, the Commissioner in Sind, and the Political Ilesident in the Persian Gulf, with orders to regulate their proceedings accordingly. To the Political Ilesident it was added— “ The Political Agent at Muscat is subordinate to you and under your orders. His official letters and communications should be forwarded to the Government of India through you with your remarks and observations thereon, but in cases of urgency or importance, in which delay would be injurious to the public interests, he is authorized to forward direct to the Government of India a copy of any documents he may address to you. \\ hen he avails himself of this power he must invariably inform you at once that he has done so.” The correspondence was forwarded to the Secretary of State, and reference was made to the Government of India’s despatch No. 13, dated 1st March 1872, in which the same views had been expressed. It was also shown how the scheme for the classification of the Political service would be affected by Hie change in the control over these appointments. \JProgs., Secret. January 1873, Abs. 220-231.] 226. Arrival of Syud Salim at Bombay—On 4th February 1873, the Bombay Government reported that Syud Salim had arrived in Bombay from Oman, where he proposed to stay for a short time, hut the object of his visit had not transpired. Abdool Azeez was said to have left for Zanzibar. Hareb, bro ther of Salim, remained at Bideeyah. \_Pjogs., Poltl. A., February 1872, Nos. 43-48.] 227. Toorkee’s actions during February 1873. —Early in February. Toorkee w ent to Burka for 10 days^vith 200 Wahabee soldiers, leaving one Nazir bin Ali in charge, as he had recently dismissed his Minister Thoweynee bin Mahomed, and appointed no successor. It was considered not impossible that he might proceed on to Khabooreh or even to Sohar should he succeed in obtaining the co-operation of the tribes on the way. He effected a reconciliation between certain tribes, hut made no further attempt. The general opinion was that Toorkee had left Muscat to escape the expen diture of the Bukree Fed in the low state of his Exchequer.Colonel Ross, who had succeeded Colonel Pelly as Acting Political Resi dent during the deputation of the latter to accompany Sir B. Prere’s mission to Zanzibar and Muscat, authorized Captain Miles, the Officiating Political Agent, Muscat, to give his advice on the choice of a Minister, if asked, guardedly and in general terms, and to apprize Toorkee if British mercantile or other interests suffered from the want of competent officials. [Progs., Poltl. A., March 1873, Nos. 190-192.] 228. The same. —On the last day of Pebruary Todrkee again went to Burka on hearing that Ibrahim bin Ghes had arrived at Rostak to concert with Peysul. This man, Peysul bin Hamood of Rostak, first cousin of Ibrahim, was understood to be the person whom the majority of the religious faction of Oman would choose as their leader in case of their again obtaining the ascendancy. \Progs., Poltl. A., April 1873, Nos. 129-130.] 229. Alleged landing of slaves at Muscat —In reporting in October 1872 the capture by Her Majesty’s Wolverine of a slaver off the Somali Coast, Dr. Kirk said he had heard, though he could not vouch for the accuracy of the statement, that slaves were landed a little way from Muscat, conveyed 'there by land and sold in a public market, duty being taken for the Government. The Bombay Government ordered the Political Agent, Muscat, to make strict enquiry into this statement. Captain Miles reported in Pebruary 1873 that he could find no foundation of truth in the statement. There was no public slave-market in Muscat, and no duty was taken for Government. Toorkee was too anxious to meet the wishes of the British Gov ernment in assisting to put down the slave trade. Though slaves were some times landed secretly on the coast, Captain Miles thought the frequent presence of men-of-war rendered it unlikely that they were landed in the vicinity of Muscat. [Progs., Poltl. A., April 1873, Nos. 95-97.] 230. Proposed departure from Bombay of Syud Salim and Abdool Azeez. —On loth April a telegram was received from Bushire that both Svud Salim and Abdool Azeez were about to leave Bombay for Oman or Mekran, and suggesting that intimation of their movements and destination should be given and precautions taken to prevent their shipping arms, as their return would be sure to cause difficulty to Toorkee. On enquiry from Bombay it was ascertained that Abdool Azeez had arranged to leave Bombay within three or four days, and that Salim was also preparing to leave. The Commissioner of Police, Bombay, did not state whether any arms or munitions of war had been collected. The Bom bay Government asked the opinion of their Advocate-General with reference to the detention of Salim and Abdool Azeez, and as to the steps to be taken in case they should attempt to export arms, &amp;c.; they referred to the orders of Gov ernment, 'So. 1216P., dated 30th May 1872, on which Abdool Azeez had been told that he would not be detained in Bombay against his will. The Govern ment of India replied that Salim and Abdool Azeez could not be detained against their will; but that the shipment of warlike stores should be prevented if necessary, and that the movement of these persons should be communicated to the Resident at Bushire. Government also wrote :— “ In the absence of any public grounds to justify such a course, Syud Salim and Abdool Azeez cannot be detained in Bombay against their will, nor can their movements be interfered with so long as they are innocent. On the other hand, ail possible precautions should be taken to pre vent them from making British territory, in which they have found an asylum, a basis for organizing an expedition against Muscat, or shipping warlike stores to be used against that State.” [Progs., Poltl. A., April 1872, Nos. 286-292.] &amp; ‘ U 231. —Adminitration Report of Muscat for 1S72-73.— The Annual Administration Report of Muscat and the territories adjacent to the Persian Gulf for 1872-73 contained a summary of the chief events of the year, which 12have been narrated above. In October 1872, Colonel Pelly having been attached to Sir B. Prere’s Special Mission, Colonel Boss was appointed to act for him at Bushire, and Captain S. B. Miles assumed charge of the office of Political Agent, Muscat. The same report contained brief sketches of the conduct of the several trucial Chiefs, which was on the whole satisfactory as regards their engagements to the British Government, few complaints having been received from the Native Agent. Peace was preserved in the seas, but unfortunate differences occa sioned disturbances by land. The report also alluded to the Turkish expedition in the Wahabee territory of Nejd and to the slave trade. [Progs., Poltl. ui., June 1873, Nos. 93-96.] 232. Murder of Nasir bin Ali, Wullee of Muscat. —Nash* bin Ali, the Wullee of Muscat, was murdered in his bed on the night of April 14th. He was a man of mild and amiable character, was not known to have had any personal enemies, and as he had only recently been appointed Wullee, suspicion fell upon three men, intimates of Syud Thoweynee bin Mahomed, the late Wullee, the supposed instigator of the foul deed, a man often described in Oman papers as Toorkee’s evil genius and councillor. Thoweynee was nominally put under surveillance by Toorkee, but on the 19th April effected his escape from Muscat in open day, bound for Soweyk, whence he proceeded for Bunder Abbas. One of the men upon whom suspicion fell of being concerned in the murder confessed that Thoweynee had engaged two men (one of them his fellow-prisoner, and the other had absconded from Muscat) for 200 dollars each to commit the murder. On the 10th May Toorkee wrote to Captain Miles that Thoweynee’s guilt was proved beyond doubt, and that he was a passenger on the mail steamer to Bombay; the Sultan, therefore, asked that Thow'eynee should be given up when the steamer touched at Muscat. Captain Miles, having previously received Toorkee’s assurances that if Thoweynee was found not guilty, he should not be further molested, addressed the Commander of the Mail Steamer India, who agreed to surrender a passenger travelling under the name of Abdoolla, if he should prove to be Thoweynee, and if Captain Miles would accept all responsibility. The result was that Abdoolla was identified as Thoweynee and given up to Toorkee’s officers. On being taken before Toorkee, Thoweynee, almost paralyzed with fear, besought his pardon with so much earnestness that Toorkee was induced to pardon him and granted him his life. He was then released and conducted to his house, where he remained. Captain Miles was actuated, in surrendering Thoweynee, by a considera tion of the universal and apparently well-founded belief in his guilt, as also the inconvenient precedent that might be established by a contrary course; but he took care to make Toorkee understand that Thoweynee was surrendered on a criminal charge only, and was not to be looked upon or dealt with as a political prisoner ; and on receipt of assurances to that effect he was given up. Captain Miles’ proceedings were approved by the Government of India. [Progs., Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 161-182.] 233. Slave Trade Treaty with Toorkee .—Sir B. Erere was successful during his stay at Muscat in April 1873 in concluding a satisfactory Treaty with Syud Toorkee for the abolition of the slave trade in His Highness’ dominions.

THE HESULTS OE SIR BARTLE ERERE’S VISIT TO MUSCAT. The immediate results of Sir Bartle Erere’s visit were (1) the conclusion of a Treaty with Syucl Toorkee for the suppression of the slave-trade; and (2) the settlement of the subsidy question. 236. Conclusion of a Slave Treaty with Toorkee by Sir Bartle Frere, and proceeding of the Government of India thereupon. —Sir Bartle Erere arrived at Muscat on the 12th April US/3, and without difficulty induced Toorkee to sign the following Treaty Preamble. “ Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Highness the Syud Toorkee bin Saeed, Sultan of Muscat, being desirous to give more complete effect to the engagements entered into by the Sultan and his predecessors for the perpetual abolition of the'slave-trade, they have agreed to conclude a Treaty for this purpose, which shall be binding upon themselves, their heirs and successors; and Her Majesty the Queen, &amp;c., having appointed as Her Plenipotentiary Sir H. B. E. Irene, K.C.B. and G.C.S.I., he having communicated to the Sultan of Muscat his full powers found in good and due form, and the aforesaid Sultan of Muscat, Syud Toorkee bin Saeed, acting on his own behalf, they have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:— Article I. “ The import of slaves from the coasts or islands of Africa or elsewhere into the dominions of Muscat, whether destined for transport from one part of the Sultan of Muscat’s dominions to another, or for conveyance to foreign parts, shall entirely cease, and any vessels engaged in the transport or conveyance of slaves after this date shall be liable to seizure and.condemna- tion by all such naval and other officers or agents and such Courts as may be authorized for that purpose on the part of Her Britannic Majesty. And all persons hereafter entering the Sultan’s dominions and dependencies shall be free. Article II. “ The Sultan engages that all public markets in his dominions for slaves shall be entirely closed. Article III. “ The Sultan engages to protect, to the utmost of his power, all liberated slaves, and to punish severely any attempt to molest them or to reduce them again to slavery. Article IV. “ Her Britannic Majesty engages that Natives of Indian States under British protection .shall, from and after a date to be hereafter fixed, be prohibited from possessing slaves, and in the meanwhile from acquiring any fresh slaves. Article V. “ The present Treaty shall be ratified by Her Majesty, and the ratification shall be for warded to Muscat as soon as possible. “ In witness whereof Sir H. B. E. Frere, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, &amp;c., and Syud Toorkee bin Saeed, Sultan of Muscat, on his own behalf, have signed the same and have affixed thereto their respective seals. “ Done at Muscat this 14th day of April 1873. [Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 476, 477, 483.] Letter to Secretary of state, No. 52 , dated yeth Sir Bartle Erere, in reporting these pro- Aprii 1873. ceedings to the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, wrote regarding his treaty :— “ Your Lordship will perceive that by this Treaty Syud Toorkee engages for himself, his heirs and successors, to prohibit absolutely the import or export of slaves within his territories, to abolish all public slave markets, and finally confers for the future freedom on all slaves as soon 16as they set foot in his territory. This last stipulation I consider peculiarly valuable, as it will discourage slave-traders from bringing their human wares to a country where the latter at once cease to be available property. Syud Toorkee however distinctly informed Sir Bartle Frere that he anticipated great difficulty in carrying out the provision.^ Toorkee at the same time addressed a letter to His Excellency the Viceroy stating that he had signed the Treaty without demur. In reply a letter was addressed by His Excellency to Toorkee on the 9th June 1873, conveying the congratulations of the Government of India on the adoption of such an enlightened policy. In reply to the Viceroy’s letter* of the 9th June the Political Resident on * ^ , t t _oho XT 3rd July forwarded a letter from Toorkee # Political A., August 1873, No. 275. , • • ^ t ^ o t containmg the usual compliments, &amp;c. In this letter the following passage occurs regarding the suppression of the slave- trade :— “ With reference to the communication which Sir Bartle Frere has made to Your Excel lency that I am ready to co-operate with him in carrying out the proposals of Government, I beg to say that I will continue to act agreeably to those proposals and will never swerve from them.” 237. Agreement obtained from Toorkee conceding to the Political Agent at Muscat jurisdiction over subjects of Native States guilty of breach of Slave Trade Laws— With a view to the effectual suppression of the slave-trade, the Government of India considered it desirable :— “ that all subjects of the British Government and of Native States in India, who within the Muscat territories may commit offences against the Slave-trade Law should be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Muscat.” t No. 1229P., dated 9th June 1873. With this object the Political Resident was thus addressed! :— u Jurisdiction over British subjects is already provided for by the Treaty of 1839 and Her Majesty's Order in Council dated 4th November 1867. But as regards the subjects of Native States, who, like the Kutchees, appear to be greatly implicated, indirectly at least, in the slave-trade, the Political Agent’s jurisdiction would appear to be defective without the express consent of His Highness the Sultan. “ His Excellency in Council accordingly thinks it desirable that you should obtain from His Highness a formal agreement to the effect that subjects of Native States of India who may commit offences within the Muscat dominions shall be amenable to the Political Agent’s Court in the same way as British subjects, if the Political Agent in any particular case thinks fit to exercise such jurisdiction.” [Poltl. A., June 1873, No. 487.] Syud. Toorkee was addressed in accordance with these instructions, and on the 1st July the Political Resident wrote that Toorkee had signed and sealed the following Agreement:— “Whereas it is desirable that all subjects of Native States in India residing in Muscat territories should be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat, and it would appear that such jurisdiction is at present defective without the express consent of His Highness the Sultan: It is hereby formally declared and consented to by His Highness Syud Toorkee bin Saeed on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, that subjects of Native States of India who may commit offences within the Muscat dominions shall be amenable to the Political Agent and Consul’s Court in the same way as British subjects whenever, in any particular ease, the Political Agent thinks fit to exercise such jurisdiction, and that the words ‘ British subjects’ in all Treaties between the English Government and the Muscat State shall include subjects of Native Indian States.” [PoUl. A., October 1873, Nos. 218-19.] This was duly reported to the Secretary of State. \Poltl. A., October 1873, No. 220.] 238. Toorkee’s endeavours to put down the slave-trade.!— Toorkee on his return from his successful ^ expedition against Sohar (see paragraph 261 post) publicly warned the inhabitants of Burka against dealing in slaves, 17 e18 and issued circulars to Bedr bin Seif and other Chiefs in the Batinah strictly forbidding the slave-trade in future and threatening those disobeying with O punishment. 239. Sale of four slaves* to an officer of a Turkish vessel at Muscat. —On the 23rd of July 1873 * Political a., October 1873, Nos. 502 -50o. Major Miles reported that during the stay at Muscat of the Turkish vessel Nedjed on her way from Busreh to Constanti nople four African slaves were taken off and sold to one of the Turkish officers on board. This occurred during Toorkee’s absence at Sohar. Major Miles wrote:— «f On hearing and ascertaining the truth of this occurrence I applied to Syud Mahomed bin Azan, who is in charge at Muscat during His Highness' absence, to have the principal Agent in the sale of the slaves, a Belooch, named Sulliman, put into confinement and the affair investigated. This was done, and it appeared that four or five others besides Sulliman were implicated in the transaction. « Although Mahomed bin Azan was willing to do anything I wished towards the punish ment of the offenders on shore, he was averse to requiring the slaves to be given up by the Turks, as it was highly probable the Turks might refuse to accede to his request, and I con curred with him in thinking that‘the demand would not be politic. « Captain of the Nedjed was an Englishman, hut he appeared to have little authority ovey flie officers who were all Turks, and he conld have rendered no assistance. The purchaser of the slaves was the Chief Officer of the ship, and I was informed they were intended for a Turkish Naval Officer of rank at Constantinople. “ Finding, however, that the affair had become known, and that Sulliman had been imprisoned, the Turkish officer apparently considered it prudent to arrange with the other parties to the sale to reland the slaves and receive back the purchase money. The slaves were accordingly put on shore secretly the next night, and the money, which I understand amounted to 60 Turkish Lira, or about Rupees 550, was returned. “As the sale had thus been cancelled the local Government was desirous to release Sulliman from confinement, promising at the same time to keep a watch on all of those concerned and prevent a recurrence of such cases. To this I consented. Sulliman being only one of a number, it would have been necessary for justice, had he been detained in prison, to have had the others punished also. “ In Syud Toorkee's absence, however, I deemed it unwise to force such an unpopular measure on His Highness’ representative, and I thought sufficient notice had been taken of the matter.” In reporting this to the Government of India, Colonel Boss asked to be furnished with copies of any Treaties or Conventions with Turkey relative to slave traffic other than the “ Imperial Firman addressed to the Wullee of Baghdad,” dated January 1847, and the supplementary instructions to Negib Pasha of Baghdad about slaves (without date). In reply copies of a Resolution of the Porte dated 29th January 1857 and of the instructions issued hy the local Government under that Resolution were forwarded to the Political Resident, and Major Miles’ proceedings were approved by the Government of India. The papers were also on the 29th October 1873 reported to the Secretary of State, and it was added:— “ We would suggest that the attention of Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be directed to the Political Agent’s letter for such action as may he considered advisable, and we would solicit definite instructions for the guidance of our Political Officers when dealing with cases of the sale of slaves at Muscat to Persian or Turkish ships. “ If any Treaties or engagements have been entered into with Turkey since 1857 for the suppression of the slave-trade, or if any declarations or resolutions on the subject have been published by the Ottoman Porte, we would beg to be furnished with copies of them.” On the 9th January 1874 the Secretary of State replied,! forwarding copy of . „ .... , . M u to*. ^ 10 , ,o- a letter fr° m tlie foreign Office, in which it was stated that no treaties or engage ments had been entered into with Turkey for the suppression of the slave- trade since 1857.

Sir Bartle Frere’s proceedings and views regarding the subsidy. —On the 1st February 1873 Sir Bartle Frere, then at Zanzibar, addressed the following letter to His Highness Syud Burgash:— “ In the year 1861 it was agreed between His late Highness Syud Majid and His late Highness Syud Thoweynee to refer certain matters in dispute between them to the arbitration of the late Lord Canning, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and after full enquiry and report by General Sir William Coghlan it was decided— “ 1st. —That His Highness Syud Majid be declared Ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of His late Highness Syud Saeed. “ Znd .—That the Ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the Ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 Crowns. “ 3rd. —That His Highness Syud Majid pay to His Highness Syud Thoweynee the arrears of the subsidy for two years or 80,000 Crowns. “ It was further decided that this arrangement was not to be ‘ considered as merely per sonal between the two brothers, but was to extend to their respective successors, and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement compensating the Ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the inequality between the two inheritances of the two brothers, which are to be henceforward distinct and separate/ “ This award was formally accepted by both brothers, and is, according to its express terms, equally binding on their successors. “ But His Highness Syud Toorkee, who has now succeeded to the possession of Muscat, complains that the subsidy of 40,000 Crowns has not been regularly paid since the death of the late Syud Thoweynee; I have been employed by Her Majesty's Government to enquire into and make arrangements regarding the payment of this subsidy, and I am directed to go to Muscat for this and for other purposes. “ I request, therefore, that Your Highness will inform me what sums have been paid from the Zanzibar Treasury on account of the Muscat subsidy since the death of Syud Thoweynee, and if any arrears remain unpaid, what arrangement Your Highness is prepared to make for their liquidation, and for the more punctual payment of the subsidy in future.” [Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 476-489.] With reference to this letter the Political Resident at Zanzibar reported to Sir Bartle Frere that the Sultan of Zanzibar was disposed to treat the matter with the greatest levity, and that finding this to he the case, he had on the 15th February 1873 addressed the following letter to Syud Burgash :— “ When the Envoy of Her Majesty, Sir B. Frere, had the honor of his last interview with Your Highness he mentioned the subject of the Muscat subsidy, and Your Highness used words which implied that you would pay nothing to Muscat. The Envoy was unwilling to believe that Your Highness meant that you would not pay the subsidy and wrote a letter on the 1st of February asking Your Highness what arrangements would be made for paying what is due to Muscat on account of the subsidy? To this no answer has yet been received. I therefore request Your Highness to send an answer for the information of the Envoy and of Her Majesty's Government.'' To this letter Syud Burgash vouchsafed no reply, and the Political Resident stated that he had ascertained that the Sultan had on more than one occasion, since its receipt, spoken of the Muscat subsidy, stating “ that it will never be paid by him, and that if his brother Tooi’kee should come to Zanzibar by permission of the English, he would find him first to meet him outright.'' Dr. Kirk added :— “As His Highness is thoroughly aware that he is unable with Zanzibar natives, and without ships to face any body of Oman Arabs, this confidence only shows his trust that Toorkee will be unable to leave Muscat owing to rivals in Oman, and I am told that by last mail letters were received encouraging the belief that soon Toorkee would be attacked and driven even from the town of Muscat. Whether His Highness is now more actively engaged in intrigue against his brother Toorkee I have not been able to ascertain, but there seems reason to think that his (m'tawa fanatic) advisers are so occupied, the present Ruler of Muscat being to them, since the murder of El Khalili, an object of the greatest religious hatred. At the same time, since departure of the Fnglish Admiral and Fleet on receipt of His Highness' final refusal to abandon the slave-trade by sea between Quiloa and Lamoo, he has become convinced that England will not interfere actively in obtaining payment of the subsidy for Muscat.''20 Sir Bartle Frere therefore on the 15th* April (then at Muscat) informed the Political Agent at Muscat that he * Political a., June 1873, No. 48i. had ^ Toorkee that he was at liberty to draw on the Muscat Treasury for a sum equivalent to one year’s subsidy from Zanzibar, viz., 40,000 dollars. Sir Bartle Frere also authoiizcd the Political Agent, in the event of his receiving no contrary order within three months, to advance to Toorkee after that period a further sum of halt a year s subsidv, reporting his proceedings to the Indian Government. Afterwaids Sii Bartle Frere on° the 2nd May, writing from Mahableshwar, forwarded the followin'memorandum to the Indian Government regarding the Muscat subsidy:— &lt;( It is unnecessary to recapitulate tlie lustory of tlie accjuisition of Zanzibar and its Afiicaii dependencies by the late Syud Saecd, of Muscat; of the division of his dominions aftei his death, Syud Majid taking Zanzibar and his brother, Syud Thoweynee, Muscat; of their quarrels, and their reference of the causes of dispute to Lord Canning; of Loid Canning s award and its acceptance by both brothers. All particulars on the subject will be found in Sir William Coghlan’s Reports to Sir George Clerk’s Government of Bombay, printed as Appendices Nos. 7 and 8 to the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons of 1871. « The further history of the case is thus summarized by Colonel Felly, Resident in the Persian Gulf— a f Under the terms of Lord Canning’s arbitrament, the Ruler of Zanzibar was bound to pay annually to the Ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 Crowns. Ihis sum to be paid annually in two instalments, viz., the first at the Mosim, and the second at the Daiman. “ c This subsidy was paid accordingly down to the date of the death of His late Highness Syud Thoweynee bin Saeed of Muscat in beginning of 1866. “ 1 His Highness Syud Salem bin Thoweynee succeeded his father aforesaid, but Syud Majid, the Ruler of Zanzibar, objected to paying the subsidy to His Highness Syud Salem on the ground of his alleged parricide. ff&lt; But in September 1866 Her Majesty’s Indian Government recognized His Highness Syud Salem as Sultan of Muscat, and required His Highness of Zanzibar to continue payment of the subsidy; in view further to avoiding misunderstanding or dispute as between the two Rulers, a subsidiary arrangement was made, under which the subsidy was to be paid through the medium of the British Political Agent at Muscat. «‘ In September—October 1868, Syud Azan bin Ghes, a scion of another branch of the reigning family, rebelled against His Highness Syud Salem and expelled him his dominions. At the date of this expulsion a balance of subsidy, as per margin, was owing to His Highness Syud Salem. “ ‘ Syud Azan bin Ghes having expelled His Highness Syud Salem usurped the Sultanat, and was acknowledged by the tribes of Oman as Imam. “ * The Ruler of Zanzibar again declined payment of the subsidy on the ground of the usurpation by a member of another branch of the family. “ ‘ The British Government did not recognize Syud Azan bin Ghes. Discussions ensued between the Home and Indian Governments concerning the subsidy, and it was, I believe, at one time suggested that we should permit the payment to cease, on condition of the Ruler of Zanzibar granting us some concessions in respect of the East African slave-trade. Meantime no subsidy was paid to the de facto Ruler of Muscat, Syud Azan bin Ghes. “‘In January—February 1871, His Highness Syud Toorkee bin Saeed invaded the Muscat territories; Syud Azan bin Ghes was killed in battle, and His Highness Syud Toorkee assuming power was subsequently recognized by us as Sultan of Muscat. His Highness Syud Toorkee being a member of the same branch of the reigning family with His Highness the Ruler of Zanzibar, the plea upon which the latter had refused payment of the subsidy to Syud Azan bin Ghes ceased to have force, and His Highness Syud Toorkee appealed, and still continues to appeal, to Her Majesty’s Indian Government to insist on a faithful observation of the terms of the arbitrament. “ ‘ On His Excellency the Special Envoy addressing the Ruler of Zanzibar concerning the fulfilment of his subsidy obligations, His Highness replied verbally by an absolute and haughty refusal, and down to date has failed to acknowledge even the receipt of His Excellency’s written communications.’ “ The total amount due from Zanzibar to Muscat, as estimated by the Resident, is shown in the annexed memorandum at §120,000. “ But on reference to His Highness Syud Toorkee, it was ascertained that he claimed only §90,000, as shown in the enclosed memorandum drawn up by His Highness’ desire by the Assistant Resident in charge of the accounts for submission to the Special Envoy.“ The third enclosure is a letter which the Special Envoy addressed to the Sultan Burgash of Zanzibar on the 1st of February last, with a view to ascertain what, if anything, had been paid of the arrears due to Muscat, and what arrangements the Sultan of Zanzibar was prepared to make for payment of arrears, and more punctual payment in future. “To this letter no answer or acknowledgment of any kind was sent up to the 17th of March, when the Mission finally left Zanzibar, though His Highness was repeatedly pressed by the Consul to send an answer. “ Verbally Syud Burgash distinctly stated to the Envoy at his last audience, in reply to the Envoy's enquiries as to what His Highness proposed to do in the matter of the subsidy,—‘ we will not pay Muscat a cent.' “ No other inference therefore can be drawn from His Highness' omission to acknowledge the Envoy's letter than that he repudiates all liability on account of the subsidy, and declines to account to the British Government for this repudiation of the obligations imposed on Zanzibar by the terms of Lord Canning's arbitration. “ This inference is in complete accordance with the whole tenor of the correspondence with Zanzibar, which I find in the records of the Bombay Government since 1868. “ In the absence of any statement of any reason why Zanzibar should not pay, nothing more can be said than that a careful examination of the correspondence relating to the award fails to disclose any shadow of argument on which any claim to escape from liability could be founded as against the present occupant of the throne of Muscat. “ The obligation to pay was the basis of the agreement to divide the dominions of Syud Saeed. But for that obligation, which is distinctly stated to be binding on successors, and not to be personal, there could have been no Sultanat of Zanzibar to which Syud Burgash could have succeeded. It was, therefore, by virtue of that engagement that Syud Burgash is now Sultan of Zanzibar, and his repudiation of liability is an ample justification of its enforce ment by appeal to arms. “ Such an appeal Syud Toorkee is most anxious to try, and if permitted to make the attempt, I have little doubt he would be ultimately successful. “ This, however, would be an entire reversal of our policy for many years past; it would ; stultify our arbitrament undertaken by us, specially with a view to prevent hostilities between ^ the two States; it would be destructive of the peace of those seas, and for a time at all events would affect most injuriously the growing commerce and incipient civilization of Eastern Africa. “ It was under this conviction that I told Syud Toorkee that I felt sure no such appeal could now be permitted by Her Majesty's Government. “ But any such exercise of our power or influence to prevent Syud Toorkee obtaining his just rights for himself appears to me, as it did to His Highness, to involve an obligation on our part to see that the terms of the arbitration award are duly observed by the other party, i.e., by Zanzibar. “ This seems to be the view consistently taken by the Government of India, and concurred in by Her Majesty's Government, as I judge from what is said on the subject in my instruc tions from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. “ I had, therefore, no hesitation in informing His Highness in reply to his remarks on the subject, that I would represent the case to His Excellency the \iceroy, who I had no doubt would do what was just and right in the matter. “ It would have been within the letter of my instructions to have given His Highness at once a distinct assurance that the subsidy would be regularly paid to him from Her Majesty's treasury at Bombay, but I thought the assurance would come with more effect from His Excellency the Viceroy, and I wished to comply with the obvious wish of His Highness that the two questions of slave-trade and subsidy should be kept clearly distinct and separate. “ Meantime His Highness' treasury is utterly exhausted by long civil strife, and his want of ready money for all purposes of peaceful internal administration. His Highness could command any amount of men and raise sufficient money for a raid on Zanzibar, and I have little doubt would easily there carry all before him; but surrounded as he is with the elements of civil discord in Oman, he has great difficulty in consolidating his power and keeping order at home. “ The regular payment of the Zanzibar subsidy is in fact of vital importance to the orderly government and well-being of Muscat, and any delay or interruption in that source of income might not only imperil the peace of Oman, but diminish our power to protect Zanzibar and its trade against the effects of Arab filibustering, in which our Indian subjects, through whose \ hands the whole trade passes, will be the chief sufferers. “ It was under this conviction, and in consideration of the time which must necessarily elapse before the question of the subsidy can be definitively disposed of, that I authorized Syud Toorkee to draw at once on the Political Agent at Muscat for §40,000 (£8,500), being 21 F22 one year’s arrears of subsidy, and at the expiration of three months for a further sum of $20,000, being half the subsidy due for the current year, unless other measures for settling the question should be taken in the interim. “ I find that a similar course was authorized by the Government of India when Syud Majid of Zanzibar refused to pay the subsidy to his parricide nephew Syud Salem, and I trust, there fore, that my proceedings in this respect will meet the approval of the Government of India. I felt bound to act at once, without previously submitting the case for the consideration of His Excellency the Viceroy, or Her Majesty’s Government, because Syud Toorkee’s position is really very critical, and £8,500 may do more for him now than ten times that sum after another series of revolutions and civil wars in Oman, every month of which must inflict heavy losses on our traders and their commerce. “ His H ighness had, moreover, just shown in the most practical manner his anxiety to meet the wishes of Her Majesty’s Government as regards the suppression of the slave-trade, and I cannot see any chance of a ruler more friendly to British interests, or more likely to rule wisely and well than the brave and prudent prince who has shown himself equally capable in adversity, and moderate when victorious, and who has the best legitimate claim to the throne on which he has just been seated by his own courage and conduct, and by the choice of the majority of the tribes and people. With such a port and a position so capable of fortification as Muscat, so close to India, it could never be a matter of indifference to us who rules there, even if all the commerce of the country were not so exclusively Indian as it is. “ Without referring to the views which other European nations have from time to time of late years held regarding Muscat as a step towards India, it is specially noteworthy just now that both Persia and Turkey have lately shown more interest in its affairs than they used to do in the days not long since when the late Syud Saeed successfully defied both those powers in the Persian Gulf. Persians tell us that Persia in her palmy days ruled at Muscat, and Turks refer to legends that the Ottoman KhaJifahs’ fiat only some few centuries ago was all powerful in Oman. Dreams founded on such reminiscences may be innocuous if they could be confined to Constantinople or Teheran, but the interests of India forbid our permitting them tp4md in Turkish iron-clads in Muscat Cove, or in a ruler who looks to the Persian Capital and s Legations for orders or inspiration. “ Nor would India be quieter if a Wahabee Lieutenant ruled in Oman, which would be a natural alternative, if Arab fanaticism were roused to resist Turkish or Persian aggressions after it had crushed the rival sect of Ibadhiya which now is dominant at Muscat. “ } would submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Viceroy that the Government of India should assure His Highness by an autograph letter from His Excellency the Viceroy that the Zanzibar subsidy will be regularly paid with all arrears from the Bombay treasury to His Highness Agent in Bombay, as long as His Highness abstains from all agressions on Zanzibar, and observes the obligations he and his predecessors have entered into reo-ardin^ the suppression of the slave-trade. “ I have nothing to add to what I find has been suggested by Colonel Pelly on previous occasions, and approved by the Government of India, regarding the mode of pay in o- the subsidy from our treasury. J ° “ Th 0 subsidy thus paid should, I think, be punctually and peremptorily recovered from Zanzibar. This is the course which I was directed in my instructions ‘ emphatically ’ to impress upon the Sultan of Zanzibar would be followed in the event of his signing the treatv to stop the slave-trade, which I was directed to propose to him, and of his subsequently beinff guilty of ‘ the slightest infraction ’ of its provisions. “It appears to me, therefore, to be a fortiori a suitable course to be adopted in the event whmh has occurred of his refusal to observe his engagements with Muscat entered in through the British Government. If immediate and satisfactory arrangements are not made for the liquidation of the subsidy, an embargo should be laid on the Sultan’s custom-houses. “ Nothing further would be necessary for this purpose than to continue the embargo which I have recommended should be imposed for the purpose of stopping slave-trade, till the Sultan of Zanzibar gives substantial satisfaction in the matter of the subsidy due to Muscat. “ It would also, I think, be well that the Consul at Zanzibar should impress on His Highness the Sultan that, whilst the Sultan of Muscat will not be permitted to disturb the peace of Zanzibar by naval expeditions, the British Government will not regard with indiffer ence any attempt from Zanzibar to stir up strife in Oman. “1 note this, because I find in the correspondence with the Bombay Government repeated reference to intrigues by Syud Salem to obtain from Zanzibar, through his mother, the means for organizing au invasion of Oman. Similar attempts seem to have been made on behalf of another brother, Syud Abdool Azeez; and Syud Majid, the late Sultan of Zanzibar, is reported to have furnished large supplies of ordnance and ammunition to some of the independent Chiefs of the Arabian Littoral ostensibly as friendly presents, but in effect as aids to them in hostili ties with the then reigning Sultan of Muscat.23 “ l he Political Agent and Consul appears at the time very properly to have pointed out to the Sultan of Zanzibar that this practice was inconsistent with the principles recognized in the amicable separation of the African from the Arabian kingdom, and the late Sultan seems to have so far recognized the propriety of the remonstrance, that for the time the practice of sending presents of ordnance and ammunition to the Northern Arab Chiefs was abandoned. But there appear to be symptoms of a desire on the part of His Highness the present Sultan of Zanzibar to resume this mode of annoying Muscat, and they should be promptly noticed and checked. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee is willing, if he receives the Zanzbar subsidy regularly, to assign suitable pensions to his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, and his nephew, Syud Salem, both now resident in Bombay. “ I agree with Colonel Pelly in thinking that these pensions may very properly be settled in communication with the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and paid through the British treasury, by deducting the amount from the Zanzibar subsidy before it is paid over to Muscat, with a clearly expressed intimation that we cannot allow the Syuds to make the British territory, which affords them a secure refuge in exile, a basis for intriguing against the peace either of Muscat or of Zanzibar. a ® o r “ (Sd.) H. B. E. Fkere, “ Special Envoy to Zanzibar and Muscat.” “ Addendum to memorandum showing amount of arrears of subsidy due by Zanzibar to Muscat. “ His Highness Syud Salem's expulsion from the Sultanat occurred in October 1868, and at that time two instalments of the Zanzibar subsidy were still owing to His Highness, viz., the instalment of Mosim (April) 1868 ... 20,000 Crowns, and that of Daiman (September) 1868 ... ... 20,000 40,000 „ “ His Highness Syud Salem was succeeded by His Highness Syud Azan, -who Vide Memorandum remained in power from October 1868 to February ’ 1871, and for this period it is not proposed to compel the present Sultan of Zanzibar to make good the arrears of subsidy. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee assumed power in January—February 1871, and if the plan of dealing with his demands in the subsidy be accepted, His' Highness' account would stand as follows :— “ Balance of instalment due on or about 30th April (Mosim) 1871, being three months' subsidy at the rate of 40,000 Crowns per annum ... .... 10,000 Crowns. “ Subsidy due for the year beginning 1st May 1871 and ending 30th April 1872, this April of 1872 being the approximate date of the hurricane, at 40,000 Crowns per annum ... ... ... 40,000 “ Amount of subsidy at 30,000 Crowns per annum from 1st May 1872 to 30th April 1873 ... ... ... ... ... 30,000 80,000 “ Abstract of arrears of Subsidy. “ Balance due on the account of His Highness Syud Salem ... ... 40,000 Crowns. “ Subsidy due on His Highness Syud Toorkee's account down to the 30th instaut ••• ••• ••• ••• ... ... 80,000 “ Total subsidy due in arrears ...1,20,000 ‘ Ike 4tih April 1873. “ (Sd.)

The Government of India sanction payment of the subsidy to Toorkee with arrears from the date of his acces sion. —On the 9th of June the Goyernment of India addressed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf requesting that Syud Toorkee might be informed that it afforded His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council Note. If it is deemed preferable to demand in arrears down to September 1872. instead of to tbe 30tb of tbe current month, the total of arrears due would be exactly 1,05,000 Crowns.much satisfaction to guarantee to His Highness the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy of 40,000 Crowns per annum with arrears from the date of his accession to the throne of Muscat in February 1871, and to convey to Toorkee an assurance that “ so long as he continues faithful to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government the subsidy of 40,000 Crowns will he paid to him annually during his rule.” The Financial Department were at the same time asked to make the necessary arrangements for payment. [Poltl. A., June 1873, No. 486.] In reporting to the Secretary of State on the same date the guarantee thus given to Toorkee it was said :— “ 'We must leave it to Her Majesty’s Government to determine the steps to be taken for the recovery of the subsidy from Zanzibar, as these measures are intimately connected with the arrangements to be adopted for the suppression of the slave-trade consequent on the refusal of the Sultan of Zanzibar to conclude a new Treaty. Meanwhile, from the enclosures of the despatch from the Assistant Secretary in the Political and Secret Department, No. 138, dated 20th December 1872, we understand that if any portion of the sums now or hereafter advanced to Syud Toorkee on account of the subsidy be not eventually recovered from Zanzibar, the half of such unrecovered advances will be repaid to us by Her Majesty’s Imperial Govern ment.” [Poltl A. } June 1873, No. 488.] On receipt of this despatch the Secretary of State on the 9th July telegraped the following enquiry :— “ Do you mean that you have undertaken on behalf of India to pay Toorkee whole Zan zibar subsidy ?” [Poltl A., July 1873, No. 235.] To which the Government of India replied :— “We have undertaken to pay Toorkee whole Zanzibar subsidy during his rule, subject to good behaviour, with arrears from date of accession. We hope Her Majesty’s Government will recover whole from Zanzibar and make her pay in future. Whatever is not recovered, or what ever future remission may be granted to Zanzibar, we expect will be shared between Indian and English Government, according to enclosures in your No. 138 of 20th December 1872.” [Poltl.

Toorkee’s reply to this letter contained no further reference to the payment of these arrears, so the matter has been allowed to rest. 243. Payment made to Toorkee of arrears due from date of his accession. Arrangements made for future regular pay ment. General statement of Toorkee’s financial position in November 1873. —On the 3rd of July the Political Resident wrote that the Political Agent at Muscat had already advanced Toorkee $ 40,000, and at the expiry of a fortnight from that time would pay him a further sum of $ 20,000. He continued :— “ If no serious objection exists, I would respectfully suggest that the Political Agent should now be empowered to complete the arrears of subsidy by a further payment of (40,000) 244 V Jt: h y foity thousand dollars at the expiration of the half-year in August next, and to continue the payment of the subsidy by half-yearly instalments of (20,000) twenty thousand dollars under the terms ot your letter under reply and until further orders.” \Poltl.

His Highness, however, is well aware of the position and has more than once lamented to me how these subsidies were impoverishino- him and his inability to curtail them, but with every wish and intention to make the best and most pro fitable use of his money, he has apparently found himself obliged to go with the stream. “ Syud To^kce is, as regards himself, a very unselfish man, and has added little or nothin^ to his own establishment and comfort, nor is any increase of State perceptible. I have pleasure in stating, however, that he has repaired and extended the old Portuguese wharf and landing pier in front ot the Custom House at an expenditure of about $ (6,000) six thousand. This is a great improvement and a boon to the merchants, as there were previously no facilities for landing goods here.” 244. Advance of six months’ subsidy to Toorkee in February 1874. Further advance sanctioned in Julv 1874 — °?. 17th February 1874 Colonel Ross telegraphed that Toorkee urgently solicited six months’ subsidy in advance. This occurred iust as Toorkee was recovering from one of Saleh bin Ali’s periodical attacks. The advance was sanctioned by the Government of India, and the Financial Department were asked to make very early arrangements for forwarding the amount. On 25th J uly Colonel Ross solicited sanction by telegraph to allow Syud Toorkee to draw on next six months’ subsidy in advance if found necessary. This was sanctioned. J 25 {Poltl.

It was, however, added* “ On the other hand, all possible precautions should be taken to prevent them from making British territory, in which they have found an asylum, a basis for organizing an expedition against Muscat or shipping warlike stores to be used against that State.” 246. Allowances of Salem bin Syud Thoweynee and Abdool Azeez.— On the 1st May 1873, Salem bin Syud Thoweynee then at Bombay applied to the Government of India lor pecuniary assistance either from the British Government or from the revenues of Muscat. He recounted the alliance of his grandfather, Syud Saeed, with the British Government, and the aid his father, Thoweynee, tried to give against “ the Wahabee presump tion,” and stated that when his father died in 1866 he assumed the administra tion of the country at the request of the people, and conducted it till the usurpation in October 1868 by Azan bin Ghias, who plundered the palace of some 20 lakhs of property. Since that time he confessed he had been a desti tute wanderer with his family, whom he sent to Zanzibar lor aid, but unsuc cessful! v. The application was said to have been made “ at the friendly desire of Colonel Felly,” and Syud Salim asked for its consideration when the Resident and Sir B. Erere were at Simla. (Poll. A., June 1873, Nos. 478-486.; 247. Previous history of Salim bin Syud Thoweynee.— On the death of Sultan Syud Saeed on the 19th October 1856, after a reign of 52 years, his eldest surviving son, Thoweynee, succeeded to the Muscat throne. Thoweynee’s reign was disturbed by the attempts of his younger brother, Toorkee, to form a coalition against him, and by the aggressions of the Wahabees and Azan bin Ghias, the Wullee at Rostak (a scion of the royal house of Muscat, though a distant cousin of the ruling branch.) On the 11th February 1866 Thoweynee was assassinated while asleep at the fort of Sohar by his son, Salim, who proceeded to Muscat, gave out that his father had died after three days’ illness, and solicited the renewal of relations with the British Government. Salim was recognized t after he had been Sultan only a few months, although Gov ernment knew X of the horrible suspicion under which he lay, and withdrew in consequence from a position of personal friendship with the ruler to one of mere diplomatic courtesy towards the State. t Muscat Precis, paragraph 28.

A weak, cowardly, unpopular man personally, his government never acquired strength; and it was only by the intervention of the British Govern ment that he was relieved from the attacks of his uncle, Toorkee, who retired to Bombay in September 1867 on the agreement that he should receive from Salim $ 600 per mensem and reside in future within the territories of the British Government. In October 1868 Muscat was attacked by Azan bin Ghias and Salim forced to fly to Bunder Abbass, bis valuables, with many heir-looms of the dynasty being plundered or destroyed. From the time of his deposition 26V \ by Azan bin Gbias Salim took measures to recover bis position; he endea voured to rally men round him on the Arab coast, and tampered with the * Muscat Precis, paragraph 29. truoial Chiefs for that object, but to 110 eiiect; he entered * also into communica tions with the Wahabee Ameer; he collected a force at El-Kishen and Bunder Abbass, and actually made several attempts to regain his lost dominions, but the Government of India warned him against any act that might tend to a breach of the maritime peace, an interdict which greatly crippled his enterprize. + precis, paragraph 77 .

Against Toorkee then Salim’s intrigues were directed, and resulted in several ineffectual descents on towns subject to the Sultan. For a short time Salim appears to have been comparatively quiet at Kishm till early in 1872, supported by the Ilenavees : he coalesced with Ibrahim bin Ghias (brother of Azan) and Sheik Saleh-bin-Ali, a powerful Chief, against II From Bombay, No. 4515, dated 31st July 1872. ^ 00rkee i ^ut in a few months Ms followers deserted || him, and he was reported to be powerless. Later attempts at activity proved equally futile, notwithstanding the endeavours made by himself and by Sheikh Saleh in the south on his behalf; he also failed in his attempts to procure funds from Zanzibar. In June 1872 Colonel Pelly asked if Government w r ould approve of his mediating between Toorkee and Salim (at the former’s suggestion), in view to relieving Toorkee of the cost entailed on him by Salim’s presence; the basis of sucli mediation to be the integrity of the Sultanat and pension to Salim, on condition of not molesting Muscat territory. Colonel Pelly doubted the Sultan s finances being capable of paying adequate pension, though he thought that if the Sultan received the Zanzibar subsidy he might perhaps expel Salim. The suggestion was allowed to stand over pending settlement of the Zanzibar subsidy reference to the Secretary of State. Towards the end of December 1872 Salim left Oman and arrived in Bombay, proposing to stay there a short time, but till the present application he had not disclosed the object of his visit. 248. Decision of the Government of India regarding Syud Salim’s allowance.— Sir L. Pelly, who happened to be in Calcutta, was consulted regarding the arrangements to be made. He wrote:— “ Sj^ud Toorkee has authorized me to say that he is willing to allow Syud Salim 200 dollars per mensem at once, and to double this allowance in the event of the Muscat State receiving the subsidy from Zanzibar. “ I am aware that Syud Salim is in extreme pecuniary difficulties, and I think Mr. Aitchison's suggestion in regard to his receiving a moderate allowance from the Government of Bombay is convenient; but I would only maintain this arrangement until the Political authorities in the Gulf shall arrange with Toorkee for the payment of his promised pension. “ I do not think that Syud Salim is dangerous to the rule of Toorkee, but if his pecuniary wants are not relieved he must either go to jail in Bombay or fly that (port. In the latter event he would return to Kishm, where his presence would create suspicion. “ Toorkee gets the subsidy, a provision for Salim might verv well be stipulated for, and meantime the Bombay Government might receive tlm discretionary power to give Salim such moderate allowance as will supply his necessary wants, conditionally on his^remuinin^ quietly in British territory [K.-W. Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 476-489.] 27In writing to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the payment of the subsidy to Toorkee, the opportunity was taken to request that Toorkee might be asked what amount he was prepared to allow Syed Salim and Abdool Azeez on condition of their residing in British territory and abstain ing from all interference in the affairs of Muscat. It was at the same time suggested that it would he most convenient to deduct the amount of these stipends from the annual subsidy to be paid to Toorkee. Pending His Highness’ decision the Bombay Government were authorized to make such reasonable arrangements for Syed Salim’s support as they might consider fit, the sums thus advanced being adjusted at a future time in the payment of the subsidy to Toorkee. \Voltl. A., June 1873, No. 486.] 249. Terms upon which His Highness Syud Toorkee agreed to make allowances to Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim. —On the 6th July 1873,* the Political Resident telegraphed from Gwadur that the Sultan was willing to allow * PoUtic “ 1 A ' J ' ,ly 1873t Nos - 3J6 ' 3 ‘’ 2 ' Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim $300 each monthly under the conditions suggested by the Government of India. At this time Abdool Azeez was meditating an attack upon Gwadur (see paragraphs 250 etseq. post) and the telegram continued :— “ I think pivsent time unsuitable for making offer to Abdool Azeez. Should his hopes of taking Gwadur fail, as seem probable, he might perhaps accept terms.” To which on the 14th of July the following reply was sent by telegram :— “ Sultan's offer may be made known to Abdool Azeez when you consider expedient.” On the 8th July 1873 the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed that Syud Salim had returned from Bombay to Kurrachee with the intention of going by land to Bushire. The Commissioner asked for orders as to whether Salim should be dissuaded from taking this step. On the 14th of July the following reply was sent by the Government of India :— “ Muscat Sultan offers to give Syed Salim and Abdool Azeez each 300 dollars monthly on condition of their residing in British territory and abstaining from interference in Muscat affairs. If Salim accepts offer he ma} r remain in British territory where he likes, but if he goes to Bushire nothing can be done for him.” On the 3rd f of July the Political Resident wrote that he had conferred personally with Toorkee on the subject of these allowances. He continued :— f Political A., August 1873, Nos. 275-281. £ “ His Highness expressed his readiness to allow each of these Princes a monthly sum of (300) three hundred dollars, on condition of their residing in British territory and abstaining from all interference in the affairs of Muscat. His Highness is quite willing, should these arrangements be effected, that the stipends of his relatives should be deducted from the Zanzi bar subsidy. * * * * “ Syud Toorkee is of opinion that Salim has lost all influence and prestige in Oman, and has, therefore, little anxiety about his proceedings. Abdool Azeez, he thinks, more dangerous and this is also the opinion of both Major Miles and myself. Abdool Azeez has undoubtedly courage and energy. A former Political Agent at Zanzibar considered he had more energy than any of the sons of Syed Saeed. He has also sought to gain the good-will of the religious party of Oman, a party which will always be of importance in Oman. It is likely, therefore, that if Abdool Azeez lands in Oman he will give even more trouble than Salim did. I believe his ultimate object to be to establish himself in Oman as a rival to Syud Toorkee and that his proceedings on the Mekran Coast are undertaken with this ulterior view. “ His Highness, whilst alive to the advantage of ridding himself of so dangerous a rival is not sanguine of his offered allowance being accepted unless under pressure. The amount is* however, as much as he considers his circumstances warrant his offering. I am most respect^ fully of opinion that every possible endeavour should be made to induce both Salim and Abdool Azeez to accept the Sultan's offers and relinquish all designs against his Government.” In reply Colonel Ross was requested to avail himself of the first favorable opportunity to propose to Syud Salim and Abdool Azeez the terms offered bv 28Toorkee. The Commissioner in Sind was also again asked to endeavour to induce Abdool Azeez and Syed Salim to accept Toorkee’s offer. 250. Proceedings of Abdool Azeez. Attack by Abdool Azeez upon Gwadur and part taken by Aga Khan in providing funds for Abdool Azeez.— On the 25th April 1873, Captain Mockler wrote from Gwadur that he had received news of Abdool Azeez having been supplied with Itupees 20,000 by Aga Khan of Bombay and of his having received some funds from Zanzibar. Aga Khan’s motive in thus assisting Abdool Azeez was said to be that he had previously assisted Toorkee with Bupees 12,000 on condition that, if successful in taking Muscat, he would confirm his right and title to the musjid built by the Khojas in Muttra, who had thrown off the allegi ance to Aga Khan. Toorkee, however, after taking Muscat did not fulfil the engagement, finding that the Khoja party was too strong to enable him to do so. On receipt of this information, the Bombay Government w r ere asked to cause enquiries as to the truth of the report regarding Aga Khan’s proceedings, and if there should prove to be any foundation for it, to warn Aga Khan distinctly of the penalties to which he rendered himself liable by in any way abetting * Political a., September 1873, No. 370 . sucl1 proceedings. The Bombay Govern- ment, * however, reported that Aga Khan wholly denied having aided Abdool Azeez with money, asserting that having already helped Toorkee with Bupees 5,000 it was hardly probable that he would afford assistance to his rival. Here the matter was allowed by the Government of India to drop. On the 4th June 1873, the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed to the Gov ernment of India that Abdool Azeez had left Bombay with the intention, it was supposed, of attempting to establish himself at Gwadur, and that he had instructed Captain Mockler not to interfere beyond warning all parties against injury to British subjects or property. These instructions were approved by the Government of India, and the Bombay Government were asked to send the first gun-boat which might be available to Gwadur for the purpose of protecting British subjects and interests should the necessity arise. On the I3th June the Government of Bombay were requested— “ that if Abdool Azeez should ever return to British territory he may be distinctly warned that he can receive an asylum only on condition of abstaining from intrigue and interference in Muscat affairs, and that if, while in British territory, he attempts to wage or abets the waging of war with Muscat, or commits or prepares to commit depredations on Muscat territory, he commits an offence against British laws, for which he is liable to punishment under Sections 125-126 of the Penal Code.” \_Poltl A., July 1873, Nos. 13-30.] On the 15th June Ahdool Azeez arrived at Oormara with the intention of leaving on the 18th for Pusnee en route to Gwadur. Humours were abroad that he would be joined by 50 armed men at Kulmat. Meanwhile news was received that Syed Salim had also left Bombay, but he was arrested at Kurrachee on a warrant from Bombay for cheating. Abdool Azeez arrived at Pusnee on the 25th June and wrote requesting the withdrawal of British subjects from Gwadur as he proposed to attack the town after an interval of four days. In reply the Commissioner of Sind directed that he should be informed that he would be held responsible for any injury that might happen to British subjects or property through his acts of aggression. These orders were approved by the Government of India. On the 1st July the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed that Abdool Azeez was reported to have gone to Kullong, in Kolano, to one t Political A., July 1873 , No. 87.

July Colonel Boss wrote that he had paid 29 iia visit to Gwadur, and that the inhabitants appeared almost unanimously opposed to Abdool Azeez, who was then about 50 miles off, endeavouring to raise a force from the Beloochees in Khelat but without much success, the Wali of Gwadur and the garrison of 10 men were also said to be well affected towards Toorkee. On the lltli July, Abdool * Political a., July 1873, No. 246. Azeez arrived* in the Gwadur district accompanied by about 100 men. Toorkee about this time was absent from Muscat being engaged in attacking Sohar. Before leaving bis capital, howevci, be took the precaution of sending a small detachment of 20 men to strengthen the Gwadur garrison. On the 15th f t Political A., August 1873, No. 327 . August 1873, the Political Resident tele graphed that a further reinforcement of 260 men bad left Muscat on the 13th of that month for Gwadur, under the command of Syed Nasir bin Thoweynee Sultan bin Seif. Ahdool t Azeez was at : Political A., September 1873, Nos. 12-25. n , 11Tls1inn p SS f u l with the Bind Chiefs whom he endeavoured to induce to join him, hut after a time he induced Khoda Nubhee Buksh to declare for him and adherents coming in to the number of 150 or 200, he moved upon Gwadur. The Wali in spite of Ahdool Azeez’s endea vours remained staunch to the Sultan and Buktar 1C ban, the chief of Pusnee, also refused to desert his colours. On the night of the 18th of July Ahdool Azeez took up a position outside the telegraph compound, making it his object cut off the town from its water to supply. Meantime lie was by order of the Com missioner informed that he would be held personally responsible for any injury that might occur to the persons or property of British subjects from liis proceed ings at Gwadur, and the Assistant Political Agent told the British subjects that if they chose to remain in the fort they would do so at their own risk. Two or three days passed without any decisive attack being made: and on the 21st July there was a temporary cessation of hostilities. About this time the “ Rifleman” arrived off Gwadur, and on the 22nd July a systematic attempt was made by Abdool Azeez to attack the fort; and it was feared that the Wali would be forced owing to superiority of numbers to yield. On the 22nd of July the British subjects finding the position serious left the town. At the same time Nubbee Buksh, apparently hearing the results^ of some spoliation which had been committed on the property of British subjects, dis severed all connection with Abdool Azeez and the attacking force appeared to devote themselves to looting the town on every available opportunity. On the 14th August the following telegram was received from the Politi cal Resident of the Gulf. “ Syud Abdool Azeez having in spite of Commissioner in Sind’s warning occasioned loss to British Indian subjects at Gwadur by his violent proceedings, I respectfully suggest that in event of his leaving Mekran without making reparation he should be arrested if found at sea, or in British territory, and compelled to accept pension offered by Sultan in view of amount of claims against him being gradually recovered if he reaches Oman: enforcement of claims will be impracticable, and he will cause much mischief. Commissioner considers this measure would be proper,” and on the same day the following telegram was despatched by the Government of India to the Commissioner in Sind, a copy being sent to Colonel Ross. « As Abdool Azeez took advantage of his position in British territory to organize expedi tion, you may, if strong enough at Gwadur, instruct Political Agent to call upon him to with draw and disperse his men, and to make him a prisoner if he refuses. Resident Bushire informed.” On the 16th August the Commissioner telegraphed that Abdool Azeez had left Gwadur on the 7th, saying that he would return in eight days. He added that he was making arrangements in communication with Colonel Ross to intercept and arrest Abdool Azeez, should he have put out to sea. He also added that Salim had threatened to attack Gwadur from Kolanch. On the 26th August the Commissioner was instructed:— “ So long as Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim do not molest Gwadur they may be left alone. If either or both return to Gwadur and threaten it, proceed as authorized in mine of fourteenth. Inform Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim of the orders you have received.” 30 % x31 Captain Mockler on the 15tli August wrote that Abdool Azeez had not returned to Gwadur, hut that a considerable amount of property had been carried off by his followers. Regarding the extent of the plunder of British subjects and the absence of any collision between British subjects and the belligerents, Captain Mockler wrote :— “ The value of property taken from British subjects amounts to about Rupees 5,000, that of the inhabitants to about the same or more, but of it I have got no list; the cost to Syud Toorkee is about Rupees 8,000. My notices numbered 139, and five shops only bearing them were touched; out of these two contained British subjects^ goods only, the others property belonging to people of Gwadur besides, but were rented by British merchants, not a foot was placed inside British precincts with the exception of the mat boat-shed, and in that matter I did not consider it prudent or politic to interfere; it was open to the telegraph people to put their boat into it whenever they chose; it afforded no protection or assistance; one similar to it could have been put up close to it in fifteen minutes and offered a fair mark for the besieged to fire at, which they did but unsuccessfully; it says much for the conduct of all parties that not the slightest collision occurred between any of our people and the belligerents'.” and regarding the part taken by Kkoda Nubbee Bux :— “ It perhaps deserves to be noted that Khoda Nubbee Bux fed himself and his immediate followers the whole time; he got supplies from his own home, refusing to eat of stolen pro perty, the others were not quite so particular, but I believe few except the Rinds personally engaged in looting, nevertheless were it practicable Khoda Nubbee Bux should be required to answer for all and make it good, perhaps this might be effected through the Khan if not a formal pardon from Government would, I believe, be a not unwise measure; the losses of the merchants wmuld, however, have to be considered, as indeed, I hope, they will be in any case.” The conduct of the men of the “ Rifleman” was most satisfactory through out the affair. 251. Compensation to British subjects for losses at Gwa- dur. —On the 23rd November 1873 the merchants, British subjects at Gwadur, presented a petition to Captain Mockler, urging that their losses during the siege of that place by Abdool Azeez amounted to Rupees 48,658, and trusting that compensation would be allowed. Sir W. Merewether, in forwarding this memorial to the Government of India on the 18th Rebruary, wrote that before submitting the question he had asked Colonel Ross for an expression of his opinion. Colonel Ross wrote in reply:— “ There seems no possibility of obtaining reimbursement of the traders through His High ness Syud Toorkee unless a demand were made on the Sultan; that this course, I think, you will agree with me would not be advisable. “ In a similar previous case of plunder by Syud Abdool Azeez of some traders at Charbar, Government decided that unless Syud Toorkee would voluntarily indemnify the traders for the acts of his brother, the matter should be allowed to drop. His Highness being sounded was by no means ready to pay. “ I am inclined to suggest in the present case that Abdool Azeez should continue to be held responsible, and that he should understand that whenever circumstances allowed of it the claims against him will be enforced.” Sir W. Merewetber thus expressed bis opinion:— “ The case alluded to by Colonel Ross as having occurred at Charbar related to a small loss inflicted on merchants there by Sultan Abdool Azeez, and which was not pressed by them. The petitioners refer to an occasion when their losses at Charbar were made good ; that was at the same time as the one mentioned by Colonel Ross, but the injuries were sus tained by the merchants at the hands of the Persian troops when they took Charbar, ousting Sultan Abdool Azeez therefrom; these losses were made good by order of the Persian Government. “ Sultan Abdool Azeez was fully warned at the time that he would be held responsible for any injury he might cause to British subjects by his proceedings at Gwadur, but under the circumstances it might be thought best that the amount should be paid now out of the Govern ment of India Treasury under the understanding stated by Colonel Ross, and that Sultan Abdool Azeez should be made acquainted with the liability. I would request the favor of order's on this subject/’The Foreign Secretary wrote :— I am afraid the sufferers must bear the losses inflicted on them during the local disturb ance. Toorkee clearly is not responsible and cannot be expected to pay. Abdool Azeez is a prisoner receiving a pittance and cannot pay. It would be both unusual and an inconvenient precedent for Government to pay. “ Persons who settle in foreign parts must take a reasonable share of the attendant risks- Government of course protect them and get compensation for them as far as they possibly can; but when redress is beyond their power the sufferers must put up with the circumstances.” His Excellency the Viceroy concurred, and the Commissioner in Sind was therefore on the 24th March instructed that — “ Syud Toorkee clearly cannot be held responsible for the losses suffered by British subjects during the local disturbances, and Abdool Azeez being a prisoner in receipt of a small stipend, it is useless to expect that compensation will be forthcoming from him. “ His Excellency in Council is unable to accede to your recommendation that the sufferers should be compensated from the Imperial Treasury. They have no claim to such compensation from Government, and to grant it in this case would establish an embarrassing precedent.” 252. Further proceedings of Abdool Azeez after his retire ment from Gwadur —On the 29th August the Commissioner telegraphed that Abdool Azeez was in Balm and Syud Salim at Kedj; and that their pre sence was disordering the country. Sir W. Merewether recommended that both Abdool Azeez and Salim should be called upon to come to Gwadur where Toorkee’s terms could be offered to them. He added:— “ If they refuse (they) could be told will be arrested wherever and whenever caught I con clude if either attempt to cross to Oman they must be arrested.” To this telegram the following reply was sent on the 1st September:— “ Inform Abdool Azeez and Syed Salim of terms arranged with Toorkee, invite them to accept and come in within ten days, if now refused terms will not be renewed; if they forcibly threaten Gwadur or attempt to cross to Oman or Persian Gulf arrest them if possible. Warn them distinctly of this.” On the 16th* September 1873, the Political Resident telegraphed that the * Political a., September 1873 , No. 376 . Rifleman had captured Abdool Azeez near 8&gt;oor with 11 armed men, and soli cited instructions whether he should endeavour to mediate between Toorkee and Abdool Azeez. In reply the Political Resident was instructed to try and obtain Abdool Azeez’s formal acceptance of the terms offered by Toorkee, in the event of a refusal to despatch him to Kurrachee. On the 29th September the Government of India were informed by tele graph that Abdool Azeez had absolutely refused the terms offered by Toorkee, and that he had also declined to entertain a proposal that the monthly allow ance to be paid by Toorkee to him should be increased from 300 to 500 dollars. The Commissioner in Sind was instructed to detain Abdool Azeez in honorable surveillance at Kurrachee, a warrant under Regulation III. of 1818 being for- warded to him for that purpose. Sir W. Merewether -was also asked to warn him that if he intrigued or attempted to escape he would be placed in custody and was authorized to expend for his support a sum not exceeding 300 dollars, to be deducted from the subsidy payable to Toorkee. * Political A., December 1873, Nos. 44-52. On the * 29th September the Commis sioner in Sind wrote :— “ I had a long interview with the Sultan on the 27th, at which he urged that he had onlv acted in the same manner as His Highness Sultan Toorkee had done formerly; that he had left Bombay with the intention of proceeding to Oman, but stress of weather had driven him on the coast of Mekran; that he had attempted to recover his old position of Walli or Governor of Gwadur, but failing in that he had, at the invitation of certain people of Oman, embarked at Gwettur, purposing to land in Oman, but was intercepted by one of Her Maiestv's vessels of war and brought here. 32 a si ■Z- “ I informed him in reply that Ilis Ilig-hness Sultan Toorkee had been recognized by Her Majesty's Government as ruler of Muscat; that he, Sultan Abdool Azeez, had been permitted to reside without molestation in British territory, but he had left it for the purpose of creating disturbances in the territory of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat; that such could not be permitted by the Government of India, and as he had attempted to cross the seas to land at Oman orders had been issued to apprehend him, and he had been accordingly arrested at sea near Soor by one of Her Majesty's cruisers; that the orders of Government were that he should be given undisturbed residence in Kurrachee provided he abstained from interfering in any way in the affairs of Oman, and its dependencies, and would not leave Kurrachee without first receiving permission from the British authorities to do so. “ He raised objections to this saying that the terms offered him by His Highness Sultan Toorkee were quite insufficient; that he did not care to remain in Kurrachee, with which he was quite unacquainted, and the Government might do what they liked with him. “ I then explained to him that having created disturbances in Mekran, rejected Sultan Toorkee’s offer as communicated to him by Captain Mogkler, and having attempted to cross the sea to land in Oman with the view of acting against His Highness Sultan Toorkee, he had now lost the opportunity of making terms, and that all I could do was to communicate to him the orders of the Government of India, which were that he was to be kept here in honorable surveillance provided he abstained from intriguing in the affairs of Oman and would not attempt to escape. That for his greater convenience I was prepared to take his promise that he would act only as was desired, when he could reside here quite unmolested, but if he declined I should be compelled to apply for other orders as to his disposal, which would involve his confinement in such place as Government was pleased to direct. I then advised him to return on board the Columbine and consider the matter well before he gave me a final answer. “ To-day he informed me through Captain Mockler that he was ready to give the promise I suggested, and supplied the document herewith forwarded in original. This makes his remaining here much more easy than it would otherwise have been, and it cannot but be more satisfactory to the Sultan himself. The wise decision he has arrived at while partly coming from the good common sense he is certainly possessed of is also in a great measure due to the advice given him by Captain Mockler, and to the influence that officer has gained with him by considerate treatment. Quarters have been prepared for the Sultan in a suitable place here, and he will land to Occupy them tomorrow.' The document above referred to ran as follows;— “ By the Grace of God I, Abdool Azeez bin Syud bin Sultan, the son of the Imaum, promise that I will not meddle in anything appertaining to Oman, its dependencies, possessions, nobles, Sheiks, families, people, subjects, or towns, fill such time as the English Government shall give me permission to do so, and I will live in whatever place the English Government desires, and will not leave it till the English Government gives me permission to do so : this I promise, and God is the best of witnesses.' In reply the following directions were given to the Commissioner:— “ Abdool Azeez should be allowed as complete liberty as you may think consistent with the enforcement of the conditions which he has accepted; but if he violates them by intriguing or attempting to escape, t^ie warrant under Regulation III. of 1818, which was sent to you with my letter No. 2292P., dated 2oth September last, should be enforced. “ The monthly allowance of $300 should be paid to Abdool Azeez with effect from the date of his capture, viz., the 12th September last, and the sums paid will be adjusted out of the Zanzibar subsidy paid by the British Government to Toorkee. Such steps as you may think advisable should be taken to prevent Abdool Azeez from incurring debt, and it should be made known to the public that no aid need be expected from Government by any one who lends him money or suffers him to contract liabilities.' 253. Toorkee complains of breach of asylum by Khan of Khelat. —On the 19th* September 1873, Political Resident forwarded two . Political A., December i 8 73 . No,. 53 . 63 . from Toorkee to Hi s Excellency the viceroy, ihey were mostly general m their terms, hut the following passage occurred in one of them:— 'What I intend to represent to Your Excellency is this, that when my brother, Abdool Azeez, .after he had started from the port of Bombay arrived in Kedj, which is in the neighbour hood of Mekran, the people of that place followed him, waged a war in Jowazer, a city in my dominion, plundered the subjects of my country, and defaced my territory. All this may be said to have been done by the Khan of Khelat, because Kedj is a dependency of Khelat, and Fakeer Mahomed is the Governor of the place on the part of the Khan, and also 33 * i34 because the Khan of Khelat and the said Fakeer Mahomed did not prevent the above mischievous men from following Abdool Azeez. This act has been done in utter disregard of the relations of friendship subsisting between me and Your Excellency. It will be sutheient it Your Excellency takes notice of this affair. His Excellency the Viceroy replied on tliQ 15th November as follows :— “ I have received Your Highness’ letter dated September last, in which you complain that when Abdool Azeez landed on theMekran Coast he was joined by certain of the inhabitants of 1 Kedj who plundered Jowazer, a town in your territory, and that the people of Kedj were not restrained by the Governor of the place. « ^I v friend, I have pleasure in informing you that Abdool Azeez is not likely again to cause Your Highness any disquietude as he has been taken prisoner and has entered into an agreement noAo quit Kurrachee without the permission of the British Government, nor to intrio-ue against Your Highness’ authority. In accordance with the arrangement entered into witfT Your Highness he has been granted a monthly allowance^ of $300 payable from the Zanzibar subsidy which Your Highness receives from the British Government.” Regarding this the Foreign Secretary wrote:— “ Under present circumstances no reference need be made to Khelat about the alleged breach of asylum. The Khan has at present no real control in Kedj.” 254. Requests preferred by Abdool Azeez in connection with his detention at Kurrachee.—On the 28th October 1873, Sir IV. Merewether forwarded a communication received from Abdool Azeez, in which he preferred three requests, 1st, that Government would effect a reconciliation between him and Toorkee and get permission for him to reside at Muscat, apparently with the view of eventually succeeding to the throne of Muscat; 2nd, that failing the Government would allow him Rupees 2,000 a month and give him $ 10,000 to pay his debts and for oth6r purposes; and 3rd, that he might be permitted to live at Bombay. Abdool Azeez endea voured to show that he had received no warning against going to Oman. Sir W. Merewether wrote :— “ Sultan Abdool Azeez seems to base his argument on the. fact that he had received no . warning against his going to Oman j but that cannot be held to affect the main issue, which was that he had been residing in safety in British territory, and had taken advantage of the facilities so afforded him to proceed to the territories of oilr ally the Sultan of Muscat and create disturbances therein. He was caught on the high seas having with him 11 armed followers, and he acknowledged it was his intention to act against the Ruler of Muscat. The Government letter he quotes certainly does not forbid his leaving Bombay, but it clearly shows his going back to Gwadur would be .disapproved, and all countenance would be withdrawn from him if he did so. . % “ Sultan Abdool Azeez makes two requests, one that his allowance may be largely increased, the other that the Government of India may interest itself to bring about a reconciliation between himself, and his brother, Sultan Toorkee. « With regard to the first, Sultan Abdool Azeez appears to have acquired grand ideas and very expensive habits while residing in Bombay. His proposals are most extravagant and very unnecessarily large. If his debts were paid and his allowance increased to $500 or Ru pees 1,000 per mensem, it would be quite as much as he could reasonably expect, and as much as His Highness Sultan Toorkee could probably afford. I should certainly not advise his being ‘permitted to reside in Bombay, on account of its being such a very expensive place, and one where he would be tempted to indulge in all manner of dissipation and extravagance. He does not like Kurrachee he says, beeause he knows no one in it, and has no means of amusing himself or of passing his time. He might be given the choice of any other place in the Bombay Presidency, excepting Bombay itself, but I have advised him to become better satis fied with Kurrachee, it being an excellent climate, and after a while he would find there were many in it worth knowing and making his friends. “ The question of reconciliation depends upon His Highness Sultan Toorkee’s views, whether he thinks it would be safe to have his younger brother settled doivn in Oman, Sultan Abdool Azeez is certainly an ambitious man, and would not be satisfied with a little power. He is very easily led, and would, I am afraid, be more likely to join in any political move that was made to appear to his advantage than to throw his w r hole weight into the scale in behalf of his brother to help in consolidating his power and establishing permanent order in Oman. He4 A'' V h- A is quite young, only 25, has good repute for courage, and having apparently open, hearty manner, with much bonhomie is a favorite generally. He would, therefore, prove a formidable rival if he ever entered into opposition/' The Foreign Secretary wrote :— “ I would enter into no discussion with him as to the justice of his arrest. He abused his asylum in British territory to foment an intrigue against Toorkee, w T ho is our ally, to rebel against him, and to endeavour to wrest from him part of his possession. His sovereign Toorkee agrees to the manner in which he has been treated, and Abdool Azeez knows well enough the reason for it. His request for an increased allowance and for a grant of $ 10,000 may be refused. He has been such a short time at Kurrachee that it is not desirable to move him at present, but the Commissioner may be told that if hereafter he thinks it advisable that Abdool Azeez should reside elsewhere in the Bombay Presidency on the same conditions His Excellency in Council will not object. “ There is no chance of a reconciliation with Toorkee. Still to remove all ground of complaint the Political Agent at Muscat may consult Toorkee and report what he may consider it practicable to do/' •/ {Political A., January 1874, Nos. 203-210.] The Commissioner in Sind was therefore told (1) that the Political Resident would be asked to consult Toorkee on the subject of the possibility of effecting a reconcilation, but that it was feared that there was hut little chance of its being brought about; (2) that His Excellency in Council was unable to accede to the request of Abdool Azeez that Government would allow him Rupees 2,000 per mensem and give him $10,000 ; and (3) that the Syud has been such a short time at Kurrachee that it was not desirable to remove him at present, but if hereafter he considered it advisable that he should reside elsewhere in the Bombay Presidency, on the same conditions as he at present lives in Kurrachee, His Excellency in Council would not object. Regarding Abdool Azeez’s complaint of the injustice of his arrest it was added :— “ In his letter Abdool Azeez complains of the injustice of his arrest, on the ground that he was not warned that Government viewed his proceedings in Oman with displeasure. His Excellency in Council can enter into no discussion on this subject. Abdool Azeez abused his asylum in British territory to foment an intrigue against His Highness Syud Toorkee, who is the ally of the British Government, to rebel against him and to endeavour to w r rest from him part of his possessions, and the Sultan, his sovereign, agrees to the manner in which he has been treated/' On the 31st January* 1874, Colonel Ross reported that he had sounded • Politic. A., February 1874 So. 315. T00rke .?. ° f , 8 reconciliation with Abdool Azeez, but that he found Toorkee not at all disposed to make any reconciliation with his brother and unwilling to consent to Abdool Azeez’s residing at Muscat or any place in his dominion. A copy of this letter was sent to the Commissioner in Sind. On the 16th February f 1874, Abdool Azeez addressed a letter to Colonel Ross, praying (1) that either he might be allowed to return to Muscat, a recon ciliation being effected between him and Toorkee; or (2) that Government would give him a pension of Rupees 2,000 and allow him to live at Bombay.- He still insisted on the insufficiency of his present allowance. To this letter Colonel Ross on the 7th March replied :— “ I am happy to inform you that His Highness Syud Toorkee has now recovered from his recent illness, and is not in need of your presence to assist him in managing the affairs of his kingdom. “ The arrangements made for Your Highness by Government and the Commissioner are due to the friendship of Government for Your Highness' family, and their desire for the welfare and tranquillity of Oman, and I trust that recognizing this you wall be satisfied, with them and be sure that all due and reasonable consideration will be given to Your Highness' affairs. Your Highness' letter will be transmitted for the information of Government, but I am unable to recommend either of your proposals at the present time.' 35 f Political A., April 1874, Nos. 233-235.36 Tins reply was approved by the Government of India, and a copy of the correspondence was forwarded to the Commissioner in Sind. In May 1874 Abdool Azeez was at Toorkee’s request allowed to return to Muscat. For au account of the circumstances which led to his recall, see paragraphs, 275 etseq. of this precis. 255 Proceedings of Syud Salim. His refusal to accept the terms offered by Toorkee; his attack upon Gwadur; his escape to Kishm. —In September 1873 Salim, then at Baboo in Persian territory, beyond Gwadur on the Mekran Coast, had been informed of the offer made by Toorkee for his maintenance, and he was told that he was at liberty to come' into Gwadur to accept the offer, provided he made his appearance with in two days after the receipt of the communication from the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur. To this communication Political a., December 1873, No. Syud Salim on the 10th September* re plied to Captain Mockler as follows :— “ Your honoured letter has arrived, and all you have said we have understood^and indeed we for our part desire to come to terms with our brother Toorkee; but he does not desire that as you will certainly see by and bye, but we desire it, but we have three conditions, and if he will agree to them, taking the great Government as his witness, we will agree :— 1 ^.—“ Let him give us the same amount monthly as we used to give him when he stayed in Bombay; and the second condition, that he does not meddle with our property in Oman knd Muscat and raises his hand from it, so that we may do what we like with it, either sell it or rent it, he must not hinder us. This we ask of the great Government that it will propose these terms; and certainly the Government is a just one and does not desire our hurt, and I have great expenses on account of my following, and we laid our condition before Colonel Pelly when he came to Bombay from Zanzibar, but he went to Calcutta to the Governor-General and we hoped for an answer from Calcutta, and we waited some time for an answer; finally, we have came here from Bombay, and now we f Belooc ice or go . are waiting here in this desert, and its “ Sher” f It is understood here that Syed Salim means he will speaking rulers, and as for him he tried by means accept the conditions he puts forward in this letter. 0 f every one to get us to accept a monthly stipend (Sd.) ’VY. L. M. an( j we wou ] ( j no t a g ree ^ b u t now we will accept, the Government being our witness.” Major Miles consulted Toorkee regarding the requests preferred by Syed Salim and thus reported the result:— “ On my communicating these proposals to His Highness Syud Toorkee he expressed him self at once as disinclined to grant Syed Salim a higher pension than was received by Syed Abdool Azeez, who, he stated, had stronger claims on him, and he was further of opinion that it would be impolitic to do so. “ His I?ighness was, however, willing to agree to Syud Salim receiving the rent and pro, fits of his property in Muscat and Oman inherited from his mother, though he objected to the property being sold or to an agent being appointed on the part of Syed Salim to look after it- as His Highness considered that such person would very probably be used as an instrument in intriguing with the tribes by his nephew. “ I quite concur in the opinion that it would not be at all advisable to increase Syed SalinTs allowance beyond that of Syed Abdool Azeez, and His Highness* objections with regard to the property also appear to me reasonable. I trust, however, that his concession in allowing his nephew the fruition of his property in addition to the amount of his pension will .lead to the acceptance by the latter of the terms offered him.*’ On receiving this report the Government of India determined that, as Salim was still at large, no further steps need be taken. Meamvhile Salim remained in Dustyari YY T ith the intention, it was supposed, of going to Jask and Kishm and watching events there. On the 5th November the Commissioner in Sind was asked to inform Syud Salim:— “ that His Excellency the Yiceroy and Governor-General in Council declines to negotiate any terms with him or with His Highness Syud Tborkee regarding him except those of which he has been already informed; that if he comes into Gwadur or Kurrachee and gives himself up unconditionally he will be granted the same provision as Abdool Azeez; but that if he does not *37 k comply within such time as you may direct, the terms will not be renewed, but he will be made a prisoner wherever found, and will then receive only such terms as may be thought fit, which will not be so favorable as those now offered.” * Political A., December 1873, Nos. 53-63. f Political A., December 1873, Nos. 156-168. On the 5th November* in reply to a letter received from Toorkee through Colo nel Ross His Excellency the Viceroy wrote :— “ Your Highness has also been troubled by the rebellious conduct of Syed ^alim, actuated by a friendly desire towards Your Highness, and with a view to preserve peace, the Commis sioner in Sind has been directed to inform Syed Salim that Government declines to negotiate any terms with him or with Your Highness regarding him except those of which he has been already informed; that if he comes into Gwadur or Kurrachee and gives himself up uncondi tionally he will be granted some provision as Abdool Azeez has received; but that if he does not comply within such time as the Commissioner may direct the terms will not be renewed, but he will be made a prisoner wherever he may be found and then will receive only such terms as may be thought fit which will not be so favorable as those now offered.” On the 8th December f 1873, the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur telegraphed through the Bombay Govern ment that Syed Salim had been duly warned that he would be seized if he refused the offer of Government, and had suddenly taken Gwadur by surprise during the absence of the Wullee at Muscat, having previously altogether declined to accept the terms offered. The Bombay Government added that orders had been issued for the immediate despatch to Gwadur of an armed body of Police under the command of an European Officer. The following reply was sent on the same day by the Government of India:— “ Arrange for vessel of war to proceed at once to Gwadur to protect persons and interests of British subjects: no objection to vessel assisting Toorkee if he asks it.” Toorkee immediately on hearing of the capture proposed to send off a body of 200 men with one gun. On the 12th and 13th of December, the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur telegraphed that he had called on Salim to surrender and had drawn a cordon across the Isthmus, but that Salim had managed to effect his escape and had probably gone to Dustyaree. Sir W. Merewether instructed Captain Mockler not to pursue or follow Salim into Persian territory, and these instructions were approved by the Government of India. On the 27th \ of December, the Political Resident tele graphed that the Captain of the Nimble, which had proceeded to Gw r adur, had asked for instructions whether he was at liberty to offer Abdool Nubbee arrears of subsidy on guarantee of procuring the arrest of Salim passing through his district. Abdool Nubbee is a petty Belooch Chief near Jask, who formerly received a subsidy from the Persian Gulf telegraph for protecting lives. This subsidy was stopped for misconduct. The Resident considered it unadvisable to treat with Abdool Nubbee for the arrest of Salim, and this view was approved by the Government, of India. Prom the details of Salim’s attack, which were subsequently reported, it appeared that Salim was only accompanied by 17 followers, two Kolanch Beloochees and a few men of the Georgis clan, subjects of Din Mahomed of Dustyar, and Captain Mockler expressed his firm conviction that the fort had been treacherously surrendered by the acting 'YVullee. On the 6th December § Captain Mockler forwarded to the Commissioner a letter addressed by him to Salim, and Salim’s reply thereto. Captain Mockler invited Salim to come to Gwadur or Kurrachee, in which case the terms therein tendered by him might still be accepted. Otherwise he distinctly told Salim that the offer would not again be made, and that he would be seized wherever found and dealt with according to the pleasure of the Government of India. Salim still refused to come to terms and referred to his previous letter represent ing the insufficiency of the allowance offered to him by Toorkee ($300 per J Political A., January 187-fi Nos. 114-117. § Political A., January 1874, Nos. 258-259.38 mensem). He claimed Muscat throne as his by right and expressed a determi nation to get hack his kingdom. On the 22nd of November Captain Mockler stated that Salim had left Dustyaree and was supposed to be making for Bunder Abbass and Kishm, although his exact movements were not known. Meanwhile ' Toorkee’s troops having arrived at Gwadur a day after the fair, had returned to Muscat: and the country about Gwadur remained generally undisturbed. the following letter to Colonel Ross :— “Concerning the sons of my brother, Syud Thoweynee bin Saeed, who are at present in Bunder Abbass, it is now a long time since I have paid them a pension, and they always receive it from me, now their brother Harab has joined them, and I have promised to give him a pension on account of * our relationship. I have heard that Salim has arrived at Bunder Abbass. If the Government think it advisable that I should give him an allowance it must include the pensions of all the rest, as I cannot pay them separate pensions. It is not unknown to you that I have got great expenses.” To which Colonel Ross wrote the following reply :— “ I have had the honor of receiving Your Highness' letter of 17th Zilkada, concerning the position of Your Highness' nephew, Syud Salim bin Thoweynee. “ Your Highness' former offer of an allowance to Syud Salim, provided he remained in India and refrained from interfering in the affairs of Oman, was made known formally to Syud Salim by order of ” Government, and he was told that if he did not accept this offer it would not be renewed, he was also warned that by persisting in acting contrary to the wishes of Government he would render himself liable to arrest. “ In spite of this caution Syud Salim immediately proceeded against Gwadur, whence he escaped along the Mekran Coast and was last heard of near Bunder Abbass. “ Under the existing circumstances, I have no hesitation in saying Government would not wish to require Your Highness at present to renew your offer of an allowance to Syud This reply was approved by the Government of India, it being added :— “ It should, however, be understood that if the Sultan wishes to make any provision for Syud Salim, there is no objection to his so doing on the part of the Government of India, though Government will not in any way interest themselves on Salim's behalf.'' On the 7th March f 1874 Colonel Ross reported that Salim was then at tolerable and that he committed himself to his uncle’s clemency as he had relinquished all intention of opposition in future. Toorkee did not reply to this address of Salim, considering the whole matter to be in the hands of the British * Political A., March 1874, Nos. 225-226. Salim made * his way to Bunder Abbass. On the 1st January Toorkee addressed Salim.'' t Political A., March 1874, No. 27. Kishm. He addressed Toorkee to the effect that his present position was in- it to be Toorkee’s intention to make a small allowance to Syud Salim.A V- &amp; v SECTION III.

Recovery of certain sums from the Sohar Chief as compensation to persons plundered by him.—In September 1871 (see paragraph 20G of previous precis) Ibrahim bin Ghais of Sohar plundered and imprisoned certain British subjects at Khabooreh, and the Government of India authorized the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to demand satisfaction or bombard Sohar. The Political Resident arrived before Sohar and his demands * Political a., July 1873 , Nos. 142 - 145 . were complied with. In May 1873* the entire claims aggregating §2,255 were paid by the Chief into the Muscat treasury, and the Government of India directed that the money should be paid to the persons plundered. On the 28th Novem ber (Political A., January 1874, Nos. 16-17) Major Miles stated that the amounts had been paid to the persons plundered or their appointed agents, a list of whom he submitted. 257. f Political A., June 1873, Nos. 218-224. Instructions t to the Political Agent, Gwadur, not to interfere in local quarrels. —On the 19th March 1873 Captain Mockler, the Assistant Political Agent, Gwadur, reported to the Political Agent, Muscat that he had received news from the Wall of Gwadur to the effect that a Muscat subject of the Redame tribe, by name Tewail, had been plundered by some Rinds from Mund. This letter was accompanied by a request for the good offices and advice of the Political Agent with the view of effecting an amicable adjustment of the affair. The Assistant Political Agent added :— “ as a friend of His Highness (i.e., the Sultan of Muscat), I shall assist his representative here to the best of my ability with advice and such other aid as it is in my province to afford but he at the same time expressed a wish that the Sultan of Muscat— “ would issue instructions for his subjects to refer their grievances always to his representative here in the first instance and not take the law into their own hands.” The Political Agent at Muscat replied that he quite agreed— “ as to the advisability of His Highness' subjects at Gwadur representing their grievances in such cases to the Wali instead pf taking the law into their own hands and expressed a belief that His Highness’ wishes and orders on the subject, with which the inhabitants of Gwadur were well acquainted, were to the same effect. Colonel Ross reported these proceedings to the Government of India, and in reply a copy of a letter dated 5th May, addressed by the Government to the Commissioner in Sind, was sent for his information. In this letter the Govern ment of India had issued instructions to the Officer at Gwadur, enjoinino- him to interfere as little as possible in local quarrels. 258. Persian appropriation of Muscat possessions on the Mekran Coast. —Sir W. Merewether in March 1873 forwarded to the Government of India the following two telegrams dated 25th and 26th March from Gwadur:— “ Reported that the Ibrahim Khan is on his way to Tiz to see new fort. Expected there in two or three days, arrived at Kassarkund four days ago, and report that two Persian 39* officials arrived at Kassarkund on road to Charbar to open up trade; that if Banians will return will be exempted from taxes for one year. Mirza Said Husain previous to leaving Tiz for Muscat took away Husain Khan of Geh’s subsidy guarantee, said none ot these people have right to money from British Government, believe Din Mahomed anu others are to be taken away also; under order, it is said, from Persia, and in forwarding them he remarked “ that if something is not arranged in regard to Persian appropriation of Muscat posses sions on Mekran Coast, difficulties will arise in regard to protection of telegraph line ” \Toltl. A., July 1873, Nos. 344-345.] Regarding this the Foreign Secretary wrote “ I do not anticipate much difficulty from the annexation of Muscat possessions in Mekran by Persia. So far as I know, Muscat had only two possessions there, Charbar and Gwadur. ' The former has been swallowed up; the latter is protected both by GoldsmhFs boundary and by the express abandonment by Persia of all claim to it. The other parts of the coast up to Gwadur are already Persian, so there remains nothing more for her to annex. “Under the Telegraph Convention with Persia we pay her Rupees 12,000 a year for leave to lay down the line through her territories and have the right to make our own arrangements with the local Chiefs for the protection of the line. The amount payable to the local Chiefs ., , for Charbar is Rupees 500 a year. With this pay- m&amp;it Persia * has nothing tw do any move than Will be to pay it also to the Sultan. with the payments to the other Chiefs who were subject to Persia at the time the engagement was made. If the Persians take the payments away from the Chiefs after we have made them that is quite another question between the Persian Government and them. If disturbances result we can stop the payments altogether, and under the convention call upon Persia to do all she can to protect the line. I do not see the difficulties to be anticipated; but it would be as well to ask Sir W. Merewether for a special report/’ His Excellency tlie Viceroy agreed and the Commissioner of Sind was therefore told:— «As Gwadur is now protected both by Sir F. Goldsmid’s boundary, and by the express abandonment by Persia of all claims to it, there are apparently no further possessions on the Mekran Coast for Persia to annex. Under these circumstances, His Excellency in Council does not at present anticipate any serious difficulties with regard to the protection of the telegraph line. Should you, however, still be of opinion that difficulties are likely to arise, I am to request that you will submit, for the information of His Excellency in Council, a special report on the subject, and suggest the measures you would propose to meet them.” 259. Supply of cannont shot to Toorkee. —On the 26th April 1873 Toorkee applied to the Political t Political a., June 18/3, Nos. 2i4-2o0. Agent at Muscat for assistance from Gov- ernment in obtaining shot for his field pieces. The Military Department were consulted, and no objection being raised, ouders were issued to the Government of Bombay, sanctioning the supply of 2,000 cannon shot if avail able to Toorkee on payment of their value. 260.

From the day Her Majesty’s ships made their appearance on the coast the Chiefs gave up their bad intentions, and it is now known to them that if they act against rule they will be brought to account; now each Chief is quiet in his place. No news from the land side since the date of the people going to the pearl fishery.” f Political A., August 1873, Nos. 317-319. at that place writing :— On the 11th July similar reports were received from Shargah, the British Agent f “ Your visit to the coast of Oman has caused a greater security on the seas, and the Chiefs of the ports of Oman have warned their subjects to refrain from committing disturb ances on the sea. 261. Toorkee’s successful proceedings t against Ibrahim I Political A., July 1873, No,. 457-480. ^ G ' ha ; iS ^ IQ July 1873.— Early m June 1873 Ibrahim bin Ghais left Sohar, where he had long asserted his independence of, and hostility to, Toorkee, and proceeded to Khabooreh en route to assume possession of the town of El llazan which he had accepted from its owner, Eeysul bin Hamood, of Bostak, who could not afford to retain it. Ibrahim, however, very shortly afterwards returned from El Kazan to Sohar. Toorkee had for some time previous medi tated the recovery of Sohar and other places on the Batinah Coast in the hands of Ibrahim, and on the 10th of June he sent 250 Wahabee soldiers in that direction, delaying to join them himself in order that he might first see Colonel Boss at Muscat. However, on the 3rd July he was said to have embarked deter mined to make an effort to take Sohar, though diffident of success. The Politi cal Besident, Persian Gulf, at the same time reported that the Chiefs of Debaye and Amulgavin would probably co-operate with Toorkee against Sohar, and that Bedr bin Syef, Toorkee’s Commander at Lawa, was also raising men from the tribes of the Batinah. The Sultan left Mahomed bin Azan Al-lu-Saeed in charge of Muscat with 100 men of the Pern bo Hanan clan, but things were not altogether satisfactory there as Saleh-biu-Ali, the Harithree Chief, although Toorkee considered him unable to carry out his menace, threatened to make an attempt on Muscat as soon as Toorkee should move in the direction of Sohar. At the same time the presence of Abdool Azeez on the Mekran Coast was a considerable source of uneasiness to Toorkee, and a body of 20 men was despatched by him to strengthen the garrison at Gwa- dur. The Political Besident of the Gulf was at the time these events § Political a., August 1873, Nos. n- 12 . weie . ^^PP en i u ' a f Muscat, loorkee ac cordingly § proceeded to Sohar and com menced operations after being joined by some of the El Naim tribe of El Dhabueh and probably by other tribes. The El Naim party, while on their way to join Toorkee at Sohar, took the opportunity of plundering the town of Soham, which was then in the hands of Ibrahim bin Ghais. In a letter || which was received at Muscat on the 20th July the Sultan announced the surrender of Sohar. After ^ having invested the fort for some days Toorkee * entered into IT Political A., September 1873, No. 76 . negotiations with Ibrahim through the mediation of Mahomed bin Ali wuld el Saef el Naimi, which resulted in Ibrahim giving up Sohar and other places on the Coast in consideration of recovering $ 5,000 and receiving a monthly allowance of $ 100 to be paid on condition of his residing in or near Heeliee, aud not approaching further east. The results of this little expedition were satisfac tory and brought under the authority of Toorkee the whole of El Batinah, with the exception of one or two refractory tribes. As far as Ibrahim was con cerned the lesson was thought to be sufficient to prevent him from taking the 41 . T. Political A., August 1873, No. 28.field a 'am for a considerable time. The political disposition of the Batinah Coast was at this time (August 1873) reported by Major Miles to be as follows. From Lawa northwards to Khor Fakan the coast was under Arabeh-bm-Jiattan El Bu Saidi. From Lawah to Khafiooreh, including Sohar, the coast was entrusted to Bedr-bin-Seif, and from Khabooreh to El Mesnaah it was under the charge of Hamid-bin-Hamad al Bu Saidi. Toorkee returned to Muscat on the 3rd August. 262. Events at Muscat during Toorkee’s absence and after bis return. —During Toorkee’s absence a party of the hostile Beni Eaweveh tribe came* down and attacked Semail, carrying off the ripe fruit of the Sultan’s date plantations there, although opposed by the Wall of Semail. Toorkee proposed to proceed in person from Burka to punish this tube but A^as prevented by illness from so doing. The Beni Baweyeh, however, returned quietlv to their districts having a promise of support from Saleh bin Ali in the event of their being attacked by Toorkee. Saleh bin Ali, the Chief of the Harithee, too had threatened that he Avould attack Muscat during Toorkee’s absence. He was, however, unsuccessful in his attempt to organize a rising at El Sherkeyeh, and Avas therefore forced to put off for future occasion his intended demonstration against the Sultan. Shortly after Toorkee’s return a party of Al Wahibeh Bedouins, numbering about 400, arrived at Muscat and encamped outside Muttra on the usual pre text of obtaining presents from the Sultan. No suspicion Avas at first aroused by their presence, but it was soon evident that Saleh bin Ali, who had been en deavouring to raise the Ilenavee tribes, had despatched the W ahibeh Bedouins as an advanced force to await him at Muscat, his intention being to follow' them as soon as possible, attacking Muttra with such force as he could collect. The Al Wahibeh reached Muttra without opposition, but here Saleh’s scheme was discovered and the Ghafiree tribe, El Nedabaeen, immediately occupied the pass of Akk, thus checking the further progress of the advancing force. Major Miles thus described what folhvwed :— “ There are three roads from El Sherkeyah to Semail and Muscat, two of which, the Wadies Dheykah and Akk, are in the hands of the Ghafiree tribes, El Nedabaeen and Rahveem respectively, the third road being the Wady Beni Raweyheh. The Wady Akk is the principal and most traversed road, and is described as having a narrow precipitous defile capable of being held by a few resolute men against any number. Saleh bin Ali hearing that the Al W ahibeh had passed endeavoured to get through at night, but the Ghafirees were on the alert and. he was compelled to retire. “ On the 16th instant news arrived by a kafilah that the sound of guns and musketry had been heard at Semail, and it was feared that Saleh bin Ali had reached Semail and was on his way with two thousand or three thousand men to attack Muttra and Muscat. His High ness had no doubt, I believe, at the moment that such was the case, and began preparations for opposing them. ' No confirmation of the rumour, however, was received during the day by letters from the Wali of Semail and others, who would certainly have written to His Highness had it been true, and it was soon preceived that there was no foundation whatever for it. “ It turned out subsequently that Saleh bin Ali after his repulse by the Ghafirees at the Akk Pass had been deserted 'by nearly the whole of his following of Henavees, who had returned to their districts, aad that he had proceeded to the Beni Raweyeh with only a few men. Here also he was able to effect nothing and soon returned disappointed to Ibra. The Al Wahibeh finding the state of affairs with Saleh returned to their country after having received a small present of $400 from Syud Toorkee. “ Saleh bin Ali has thus again signally failed in an attempt to attack and dispossess His Highness Syud Toorkee by a coalition of the Hinawee tribes against him, and as Saleh's ex penses in this effort are said to have amounted to about ($1,500) one thousand and five hundred, he has merely weakened his own resources without gaining any result whatever. It is probable nevertheless that .Saleh is by no means discouraged at his ill success, and will continue to watch a fitting opportunity to rise again; his failure this time is chiefly attributed to his want of money or rather to his want of liberality in spending it. 42 'V -v» “ Another probable cause of Saleh's ill success is the fact of bis having no one of the ruling family with him to put forward. He cannot claim the throne himself, and could only act in the name of one of the late Syud Saeed's children; Syud Toorkee's two rivals, Salim bin Thoweynee and Abdool Aaeez, are not in the country, and the only one whom Saleh has to his hand is Harib, Salim's younger brother, who is at present in Jaalan. Harib is said to be a dull youth with an impediment in the speech and is incapable probably of ever coming forward as a claimant in person, but he might be used as a convenieut tool by Saleh.' {Political A., October 1873.] About the same time Toorkee despatched Hamad bin Ahmed to negotiate on his behalf with the Beni Itaweyeh and endeavour to bring them over to his allegiance. For some short time after this Oman was comparatively quiet and Major Miles, on the 5th September, thus reported the favorable termination of these negotiations :— “Syud Hamid bin Ahmed returned to Muscat on the 1st instant, bringing with him Sheik Seif bin Hamad, Sheik Saleh Theneysh, Sheik Mahomed Nasir, Moolla Salim Odeyim, and Moolla Suliman Omeer, with about four hundred of the tribe. Since their arrival several conferences have taken place between them and His Highness, which have now terminated satisfactorily, the tribe, I understand, having declared their readiness to yield submission to Syud Toorkee and to refrain in future from hostile acts and coalition with his enemies on certain conditions being granted to them, the principal of which are (1) that they shall be forgiven the blood on their hands, particularly that of Syud Mahomed bin Saeed, Wullee of Burka, whom they murdered last year; (2) that part of the landed property, date, palms, &amp;c., of the late Khaleelee, shall be restored to his family; (3) that they shall receive the customary subsidies every year from His Highness; and (4) that the two Moollas, Salim bin Odeyim and Suliman Omeer, shall receive a regular stipulated allowance, all of which conditions have been acceded to by His Highness. “ Although this amicable arrangement with the powerful Beni Raweyeh will doubtless strengthen His Highness and serve as a considerable check upon Saleh bin Ali El Harithee, it remains to be seen how long it is likely to last, and whether the Ghafiree tribes will not be affronted at the understanding thus come to by His Highness with their natural enemies, the Henavees.' Writing on the same date Major Miles reported that no further movements had taken place on the part of Saleh bin Ali, but that news had been received of Ibrahim bin Ghais having left El-Hazan and proceeded to the Batinak, which report caused Toorkee some disquietude. 263. MisceHaneous occurrences. —Major Miles also reported the following miscellaneous items of intelligence :— “ A short short time back a tribal dispute occurred between the tribes, Beni Rasib and Beni-bu-Hassan El Sharkujeh, which resulted in bloodshed. His Highness Syud Toorkee, however, on hearing of the affair, and at the request of the parties sent an order for a truce for one year, which both parties have accepted and promised to observe. “ During his late expedition to the Batinah, His Highness Syud Toorkee became displeased with one of the Al-bu-Saide, Syud Hamid bin Hamed bin El Imam, at Burka, whom he discovered to have been carrying on a treasonable correspondence. Hamid was put into confinement and brought down here, where he has since been imprisoned in the Meranee Fort. A party of the El Maavali tribe have to-day arrived at Muscat with the object of in terceding with His Highness on Hamid's behalf. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee informed me, during a recent visit I paid him, of his approaching marriage with the daughter of Syud Hamed bin Salim, his cousin, and mentioned that it would probably take place shortly. His Highness is at present unmarried.' # Political A., November 1873, No. 19. quently reported as having taken Toorkee’s marriage with the daughter of Syud Hamed bin Salim* was subse- place. 264.

Wrote 1 “ Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali, El Harithee, has been endeavouring to strengthen himself by seek- inff a marriage with the daughter of Munsoor-bin-Nasir, Sheikh of the Al-Wahibi Bedouins. Sheikh Munsoor, however, before consenting referred to Syud Toorkee on the subject, who requested him to endeavour first to induce Sheikh Saleh bin Ah to visit His Highness at Muscat with a view to an amicable arrangement, or fading that to obtain in concert with the other Sheikhs of the tribe a solemn assurance from Saleh that he will remain quiet in future in his own country, and refrain from hostile demonstrations against His Highness’ authority. “ Sheikh Munsooris answer was received this morning, and the letter which I have seen informs His Hhriiness that Saleh bin Ali has agreed to an interview with him at Muscat, and that he will shortly proceed thither. Sheikh Munsoor in his letter also acknowledges the allegiance of his own tribe and that of the Beni Habaas to His Highness and expresses his ready obedience to his wishes. “ The A1 Wahibi are Henavees and a very powerful tribe, and their conduct in this affair seems sio-nificant of a change of feeling among the Henavee tribes of El-Sharkujah and of an intention on their part to join His Highness Syud Toorkee and yield submission to his authority.” Tranquillity prevailed for the next three months, hut on the 19th January 1874 Major Allies telegraphed t that Saleh X Political a., March 1874, No. 20o. ^ unex p ec tedly arrived with a force at Hui. He defeated Budr bin Seif and occupied Muttra. The crisis was a serious one. Major Allies telegraphed to the Political Resident:— “ Saleh bin Ali’s force arrived atRui yesterday morning quite unexpectedly. Toorkee taken completely by surprise and unprepared to receive them. Budr bin Seif attacked Saleh s force near Bui yesterday but was defeated with 13 killed and had to retire to Muttra, whence he returned to Muscat in the evening. Saleh occupied Muttra during night. Saleh haS*Azzan’s son with him, Ibrahim besieging Burka; have taken all available precautions for protection of British subjects; but they have been beaten and their shops plundered at Muttra, ioorkee weak and unable to rise from bed but able to direct operations. Saleh s advent caused by report reaching him of Toorkee’s death. If Aluscat can hold out two or three days aid will arrive from Soor. Syud Toorkee requests interference of Government. Respectfully submit Toorkee’s claims to support, and solicit instructions as to what aid I may give him. Please despatch men-of war at once. Your presence very desirable.” The Government of India on the 20th January directed Colonel Ross to proceed to Aluscat and approved of his orders that the Nimble should proceed at once from Henjam. It was added :— “ If another vessel available send it also to coast to cruise. You should demand satisfaction from rebel holders of Muttra for injury to British subjects after enquiry into facts. If refused bombard fort after 48 hours’ notice. You have full powers to help Toorkee actively so far as guns of vessels of war will reach and to protect British interests. Undertake no operations on shore.” The Political Resident arrived at Muscat on the 26th January and on the 1st of February telegraphed:— “ Rebels had already retired on receipt of a sum of money from Toorkee, whose position is not altered in any way. All particulars will be submitted by post. There is no danger now and everywhere quiet. Sultan’s health improving. One vessel of war will be required to remain here for present.”On the 2nd of February Colonel Foss telegraphed that his presence being no longer required at Muscat he was about to return to Bush ire. He added that Toorkee solicited 100 barrels of gunpowder from Government on payment. This application was transferred to the Military Department by whom the necessary instructions for compliance were issued to the Bombay Marine Department. On the 0th February Colonel Foss telegraphed that rumours existed at Muscat that Saleh bin Ali was again organizing an extensive rising in Sharkeyeh. Meanwhile the 'Philomel and Nimble were both at Muscat and the Rifleman at Jask. These rumours were reported on the 17th of February to be untrue. Everything was then quiet, the Nimble had gone to Bombay and the Philomel was leaving for the Gulf. On the 81st January 1871 Colonel Foss reported in full detail the circumstances of the recent disturbances. Briefly they were as follows: False news of the death of Toorkee reached Sheikh Saleh bin Ali, and there is reason to believe that this was purposely communicated to him by a man named Shamin bin Hassan, one of Toorkee’s retainers, but a known enemy of his. On receiving the news Sheikh Saleh bin Ali bringing with him Syud Hamood, the eldest son of Azan bin Ghais, a youth of 12 years of age, whom he intended to put forward as a puppet, started at once with a force of about 300 men for Muscat. On 17th January news was received that he had arrived at the village of Fui. Toorkee sent out a force to oppose him of 125 Wahabees. Toorkee’s troops were overcome after an obstinate fight. On the night of the 17th January or the morning of the 18th Sheikh Saleh (who by that time must have known that the news of Toorkee’s death was false) took possession of Muttra. A general plunder ensued and considerable loss was inflicted on the property of British subjects. Toorkee, whom the Political Agent found in a weak and despondent condition, asked for the support of Government, and the Political Agent assured ‘him that his request should he made known. Toorkee also asked the Political Agent to write to Sheikh Saleh and require him to evacuate Muttra; but Major Miles did not feel himself authorized to take this step in the absence of a sufficient force to coerce Sheikh Saleh in the event of a refusal on his part to comply. On the 19th January a message was received by Toorkee from some of the rebels at Muttra, saying that they wished to come to terms and to apologize for their conduct. After some negotiation an amicable arrangement was made by which Toorkee agreed to pardon the rebels and the rebels agreed that Muttra should be evacuated by them on receipt of 6,000 dollars and 100 hags of rice. The Political Agent endeavoured to induce Toorkee to prolong the negotiations pending the arrival of a British man-of-war feeling that the arrangement was an unwise one. In this he was unsuccessful and the terms, of the agreement were carried out on the 22nd January and Muttra was evacuated. The full conditions of the agreement between Saleh bin Ali and Toorkee were — “ \st .—The confiscation and sales of property by Syud Azan bin Ghais, and now in the hands of the Harithee and Beni Raweyeh tribes, to be confirmed. “ 2nd .—That all Khulelee’s property shall be restored to If?s sons and families. “3rd .—That the property of Hamad bin Suliman shall be restored in like manner. “ 4&gt;th .—Saleh bin Ali is to undertake that Ibrahim bin Ghais shall not oppose Syud Toorkee in any way. “ r oth .—That Syud Toorkee shall not undertake hostile operations against Ibrahim bin Ghais. “ 3lh .—The followers of Saleh bin Ali in the present affair to be forgiven and not punished. “7/7/.—That Syud Toorkee shall not listen to evil and unfounded reports aeainst Saleh bin Ali.” Thus ended Saleh’s rising. Toorkee’s behaviour was said to have been admirable, and although suffering from illness he continued throughout 45 mto issue the necessary orders and direct the operations. Ihe proceedings of Colonel Uoss and Major Miles during the disturbances were entirely approved by the Government of India. 266. Loss suffered by British subjects at Muttra.— Imme diately on hearing of the threatened attack on Muttra the 1 ohtieal Agent proceeded thither (on the 17th January), but found that there was not sufficient time to make special arrangements for the removal of the property of the Banians. He wrote to Sheikh Saleh, requesting him to respect British subjects and their property and holding him responsible for any loss. In the general plunder which ensued on the entry of the rebels into the town no respect was shown to British subjects, Banians’ and Khojas shops being broken into and sacked. The Political Agent subsequently again proceeded to Muttra before its evacuation and personally requested an explanation from Sheikh Saleh, lie at first denied that the traders had been plundered, but afterwards said that as he had now made peace with Toorkee and had been pardoned he could only hold himself accountable to him. He declined to make any reparation unless required to do so by the Sultan. Colonel Boss pointed out that there were three courses open to the Government of India (1.) To hold Saleh still personally responsible, and take all practicable moans to enforce redress from him or punish him. (2.) To hold Toorkee responsible and require him to make good the losses. (3.) To let the matter drop. The difficulty arose from the fact of Toorkee having pardoned Sheikh Saleh. Toorkee in a conversation with Colonel Ross said: (1) “that it would be unfair to make him (Toorkee) responsible; (2) “ that Saleh was the culprit and should be called upon for redress ; (3) “ that he (Toorkee) was unable to enforce redress from Saleh ; (4) “ that Government were at liberty to deal direct with Saleh so far as he (Toorkee) was concerned.” Regarding this the Foreign Secretary wrote “ As regards compensation to our subjects, if Saleh were still in rebellion and in posses sion of Muttra, we might deal direct with him and force him to pay under threat of bom bardment, as we did the other day with Ibrahim at Sohar. But peace having been restored and the rebel pardoned we can only deal with * See Colonel Ross’ view to the contrary in para- rp 00r k ee whom we ought to hold responsible,* and graphs 21 to 23. w h 0 cught to be required to pay out of the ad vance of half a year’s subsidy (20,000 crowns) just paid to him. Accompanied as the demand will be with the conferment of substantial favours Toorkee will see there is nothing hostile or unfriendly in it, but that it is merely what justice to our subjects requires.” His Excellency the Viceroy agreed, and the following instructions were issued accordingly:— “ Regarding the losses sustained by British subjects at Muttra, His Excellency in Council considers that peace having been restored and Sheikh Saleh bin Ali pardoned, Syud Toorkee alone can be held responsible for the payment of compensation. On the conclusion of the investigations which are being made as to the exact extent of the losses, Syud Toorkee should be requested to pay the necessary compensation from the advance of half a year’s subsidy which was sanctioned in the telegram from this Office, No. 463P. of 18th ultimo. “ Accompanied as the demand will be with the conferment of substantial favors, His Excellency in Council feels assured that Syud Toorkee will see that the property of British subjects having been plundered by rebels whom he has pardoned it is his duty to comply with it.” The total loss amounted f to $4,739, and on the 25th J June Colonel Ross reported that Syud Toorkee had in formed Major Miles that he would take it upon himself to satisfy the claims of the •f Political A., May 1874, Xos. 22-23.

Question of succession to the throne of Muscat in the event of Toorkee’s death. —On the 7th February Colonel E,oss wrote:— “ It may be perhaps proper for me to attract the ‘attention of Government to the fact of there being no one person in Oman at present who, in the event of the Sultan's demise, would have a pre-eminent chance of succeeding to the Sultanate of Muscat. “ Many of the Henavee tribes, as represented by Saleh bin Ali, seem to be well disposed towards the branch of the reigning family to which Azan bin Ghais belonged; and it is not improbable a vigorous effort would be made to bring in one of the members of that branch. “ Of the descendants of the Syud Saeed bin Sultan, I am of opinion that next to the present Sultan his brother Abdool Azeez would at present command most support in Oman. 'His Highness Syud Toorkee has not himself expressed any wish or opinion regarding the question of succession, and of course the subject has not been discussed.' • [Political A., May 1871, Nos. 19-31.] In reply Colonel Hoss was informed that in the event of the death of Syud Toorkee, His Excellency in Council considered it undesirable that there should be any interference of any kind on the part of British officers in the choice of a successor. Before giving an account of the proceedings of Ibrahim bin Ghais I append one or two items of miscellaneous information. 268. Apprehended disturbances at Bunder Abbass:— In February accounts reached the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf that the town of Bunder Abbass was in danger of being looted by Baharloo Arabs, the Governor, Ahmed Shah, having stated his inability to protect the town. Colonel Ross telegraphed the news to Mr. Thomson at Teheran, and requested the Captain of Her Majesty’s Ship Philomel, which was then at Jask, to visit Bunder Abbass. [Poltl. A., March 1874, Nos. 246-247.] 269. Complications between the Chiefs of Shargah and Ras-el-Khymah. —In September 1873 Major Grant, 1st Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited the Oman Coast. Arriving at Aboothabee he found that the Chief of that place had marched to attack Shargah, the alleged cause of quarrel being an attack made by some Bedoos in alliance with Shargah on the Bedoos in alliance with Aboothabee. The quarrel was a trivial one and did not apparently result in loss of life. The Chief of Ras-el-Khymah was also attack ed by Aboothabee, and both Shargah and Ras-el-Khymah moved reinforcements in boats along the coast. Major Grant, however, warned the Chief of Shargah that in sending armed men to sea both he and the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah had broken the maritime truce and that their conduct would be reported to Government. Colonel Ross wrote :— “ Such movements by sea have always been discountenanced by the Resident as likely to lead to warfare on the seas, and it was therefore proper on the part of Major Grant to warn the Chiefs as he did.' [Political A., December 1873, Nos. 2-3.] # 270. Proceedings of the Beni Rujam tribe of label Akh- dar. —On the 19th September 1873 Major Miles wrote :— “ His Highness the Sultan informs me that the Beni Rujam tribe of Jebel Akhdar have begun to show a somewhat turbulent and aggressive spirit of late. This tribe is ruled by two Sheiksh, brothers, Nasir and Suliman bin Seif bin Suliman, who are desirous of obtaining possession of certain property belonging, or said to belong, to them in Nezwa and Birket-el- Mong. They expect to gain both wealth and influence by a rising, and will probably create a disturbance before long. This tribe is Ghafiree, and does not receive any subsidy from His Highness.'

He captures Mesnaah but is dislodged by aid of British Ships of war. —Notwithstanding Ids reverse at Sohar, see paragraph 261 supi'ci) Ibrahim continued to persist in his com sc of intiiguc and opposition to Toorkee. On the 18th* September 1873 Major Miles reported that Ibrahim had made an arrangement with Syud Eeysul * Political A., November 1873, Nos. 16-20. ^ IIamood by the latter delivered up possession of the fort of El-Rostak on receiving from Ibrahim the sum of $2,200 and certain date groves. Major Miles added “ Ibrahim bin Ghais has now possession of the two principal forts in that part of the country, El-Rostak and El-Hazan, and he is constantly engaged, I understand, in gaining friends and influence. It is, however, not considered probable that he has any actively hostile intentions at present. I learn that on his recent visit to the Batinah C oast, he succeeded in coming to some understanding with the Sheikhs. “ Syud Feysul bin Ilamood appears to have now retired altogether from public affairs, and it is said he intends to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca next year.” On the 7th March 1874 Major Miles telegraphed that Ibrahim was raising the Batinah Coast and actively besieging Mesnaah, and also that his oper ations were likely to prove extensive. Major Miles suggested that he should inform Ibrahim that he would be considered as acting hostilely against the British Government if he did not withdraw his force. Colonel Ross however proposed to instruct the Political Agent not to address Ibrahim in the above sense, but in case of Muscat being attacked to be guided by the general tenor of the recent orders of Government, in the case of Saleh bin Ali’s attack (see paragraph 265), Colonel Ross considered it inexpedient to aid Toorkee actively on the Batinah Coast. In reply, the following telegram was on the 13th instant despatched to Colonel Ross :— “ Viceroy concurs that active assistance on Batinah Coast cannot be given to Toorkee, but Ibrahim may be told that as Toorkee is our ally his rebellious proceedings are viewed with displeasure; and that he will be held responsible for injury caused to British subjects and will be required, if necessary, to make reparation. If Muscat is attacked, former instruction in Saleh's case will apply. If possible, third vessel will be sent to Gulf.” [Political A., March 1874, Nos. 307-316.] The Marino Department was also asked to make early arrangements for sending a third vessel to the Gulf in addition to the Philomel and Rifleman. On the 13th March Major Miles telegraphed that he had proceeded to Mesnaah in the Philomel accompanied by an officer of Toorkee’s and two banians who had been plundered there, lie found Ibrahim besieging the Fort with a large force, but a vigorous defence was opposed to him. He continued :— “ Informed Ibrahim and rebels that Government viewed rebellious hostility with dis pleasure, and requested explanation as to plunder of British subjects. Ibrahim replies evasively denying plunder by his men. Considerable property belonging to banians remained in fort, the necessity for prompt removal of which before fort succumbed to rebels was a principal reason for my not waiting for further orders •, before starting on Tuesday, therefore valuables to extent of eleven thousand Rupees were removed from fort to Philomel. Being fully satisfied from banians' depositions of justness of claims, I demanded satisfaction for losses amounting to dollars seven thousand five hundred, giving forty-eight hours for Ibrahim to come to arrangement. On Wednesday morning fort very unexpectedly gave out and rebels appeared taking possession. I considered it would not be politic, or in accordance with expressed views of Government, to allow it to be occupied by rebels until orders of Government were received and until satisfaction for losses had been made; therefore requested rebels to withdraw and not occupy. This was refused by Ibrahim, and after another warning, that if fort not evacuated, they would be dislodged by force, had been disregarded, they were shelled out of it. Ibrahim subsequently consented to pay damages . if proved to be due by him, but he still 48 V49 N denied his liability for them. He declared wish to depute some one on board to consult with me yesterday evening ami a boat was sent, but owing to heavy surf was unable to communi cate with shore. I considered it advisable to wait no longer without reporting proceeding and obtaining orders and left last night. Other claims by British subjects have now been received bringing up total losses to fourteen thousand two hundred and-fifty dollars. One banian was killed by a shot during attack on town by rebels, though apparently accidental. Ibrahim has declared intention of attacking Burkah and Soweik and of prosecuting hostilities against Sultan.” On the 14th March the following telegram was despatched to Colonel Ross by the Government of India :— “ Major Miles’ proceedings approved. Ibrahim should be warned that unless he gives full compensation to British subjects to such extent as Major Miles may determine to be just, he will be treated wherever found as enemy of British Government. As regards matters in which Toorkee only is concerned and interests of British subjects are not immediately con cerned, Major Miles will be careful to get Toorkee’s assent to his action. With this proviso and subject to the condition that no operations are to be undertaken on shore Major Miles should support Toorkee as far as guns from sea can reach as already directed.” On the 14th March Colonel Ross telegraphed :— “ I have instructed Major Miles on return to Muscat to take all possible precautions for safety of British subjects and property, and to detach, if requisite, one vessel to Batinah on this service, also to avoid actual hostilities, unless under circumstances clearly authorized by Viceroy’s orders. In event of Ibrahim’s failing to give redress it may be considered necessary to treat him as an enemy and to dislodge him from any positions he may occupy within reach of our vessels’ guns. In case Government consider it necessary I shall be prepared to proceed to Muscat.” On the same date Colonel Ross forwarded by telegraph certain telegrams received from Major Miles. In these telegrams Major Miles asked for instruc tions as to whether he was to proceed personally to obtain reparation from Ibrahim for British losses, as he considered it impracticable to do so by corre spondence. Major Miles continued— “ In event of his not complying, what course is to be pursued, are Ibrahim’s operations on Batinah Coast to continue and Mesnaah to be occupied by him until satisfaction given ? Have already warned British subjects at Sow T eik to remove property. Some property of banians still remains at Mesnaah and protection of vessel will be required in removing it.” Colonel Ross replied :— “ Use your discretion about returning straight to Muscat. Arrived there urge on Toorkee necessity for exertion on his part to repress rebellion. Bending further orders from Govern ment of India content yourself with making formal written demand for reparation on behalf of British subjects with intimation that if not complied with, Ibrahim will be liable to coercive measures, and sending ship of war to watch proceedings and aid British subjects as far as possible.” On the IGth March the Government of India telegraphed in reply to Colonel Ross:— “Proceed yourself to Muscat. Instructions contained in my telegrams of 13th and 14th maintained.” On the 15th March Major Miles telegraphed that he had arrived at Muscat from Mesnaah, that Toorkee had not yet succeeded in organizing effective opposition to Ibrahim, and that if, as was not improbable, Burkah fell into Ibrahim’s hands, Toorkee’s position would be highly critical. Colonel Ross in forwarding this telegram on the 17th March added that he was on the point of proceeding to Muscat and proposed visiting the Batinah Coast en route. Colonel Ross arrived at Muscat on the 23rd after ascertaining on his way there that Ibrahim’s followers still held Mesnaah. After consulting Toorkee he proceeded to Mesnaah accompanied by Major Miles, and assembled the llijle- mau, Philomel, and Hugh Rose. On the 31st March he telegraphed :— “ I ordered Ibrahim to evacuate the fort on twenty-seventh, and then requested the Senior Naval Officer to destroy the fort fortifications as far as practicable by fire of the guns of the squadron, and this was carried out. This measure, besides being necessary in support of pro ceedings already approved by Government, was expressly desired by Toorkee. The operations50 entailed no loss of life. In addition to this chastisement I haVe held Ibrahim and allies, the Yal Saad, fully responsible for the claims of British subjects, giving- the full warning authorized by Government. The Sultan is undertaking negotiations, but I have enjoined him not to pardon the offenders until British claims are satisfied. . At present the rebellion has collapsed, and Toorkee has no apprehension and requires no present active assistance; he fully appreciates the support so opportunely accorded. Major Miles will watch proceedings in reference to claims for compensation and report, but at present no further active measures are contemplated. “ If possible, I beg May Frere or another Bombay Marine vessel may be temporarily placed at Muscat. I shall leave one man-of-war with Major Miles, and purpose proceeding back to Gulf returning later if necessary.” On the 2nd April the Government of India telegraphed approval of Colonel Ross’ proceedings, and the Marine Department were asked to make im mediate arrangements to place the JMciy Frere or another vessel of the Bombay Marine at the temporary disposal of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Muscat. On the 5th April Colonel Ross telegraphed :— “ Mesnaah, 2nd .—Communicated with Ibrahim bin Ghais to-day. He requested ten days’ time to consult with Chiefs of \al Saad about payment of compensation. I have allowed this and required him to refrain from any operations against Sultan’s ports.” Ilis action was approved by the Government of India. 272. Detailed* reports of the rising in the Batinah — On the morning of the 6th March news * Political A., June 1874, Nos. 252-277. i i m i ~ at 4 . ti, l * l 1 reached Toorkee that Ibrahim had ap peared the previous day before the town of Mesnaah with a small force. Tie immediately attacked the town, but was repulsed. The Wullee of Burkah, on hearing of the event, immediately despatched 50 men to succour the fort, and the Wullee of Mesnaah Hamid bin Hamad, who was then in Muscat, set off at once to return to his post. On the night following his repulse again attacked the fort and succeeded in taking the town or bazaar which is surrounded by a wall conti guous to one side of the fort. Having been joined by fresh numbers he was enabled to hem in the fort on all sides and entirely cut off its communication. The Wullee Hamid bin Hamad therefore on reaching Burkah found himself unable to enter Mesnaah or to succour it in any way. Major Miles was on the night of the 7th of March informed by two principal banian traders of Mesnaah, who had arrived in Muscat, that during the day between Ibrahim’s first and second attack they had managed to remove the hulk of their property to the inside of the fort and deposit it with the Wullee for security, but that all their goods remaining in their houses in the bazaar taken by Ibrahim had been plundered. These men also represented Ibrahim’s force as amounting to at least 1,000 men of the Yal Saad, by the most numerous Hinavee tribe in the Batinah, and it was stated that Ibrahim’s force were increasing. Hearing of the danger to British subjects, Major Miles left Muscat at once for Mesnaah. The position was a critical one as Burkah is the key of Muscat. Ibrahim bin Gliais too was something more than a mere adventurer; being an ambitious and formidable rival, and a man who, if he once found the tide turning in his favor, would neglect no means of pushing his fortune to the utmost. Before leaving Muscat Major Miles visited Toorkee and procured his full approval and consent to his visiting Mesnaah. Tooikee moreover deputed his Wahabee Jemadar, Ibrahim El-Awere, to accompany Major Miles. On arriving at Mes naah on the 9th March in Her Majesty’s Philomel, Major Miles found the fort surrounded and briskly besieged by the rebels. He at once wrote the following letter to Ibrahim :— “ It has become known to me that you have advanced on Mesnaah in rebellious hosti lity to His Hig-hness the Sultan Syud Toorkee, who is the friend of the British Government, and moreover that you have plundered the houses and property of banians and other British subjects. I therefore inform you that you are held responsible for all losses and injuries sustained by them through your proceedings, and that I require an explanation and satisfaction for the same.”51 To which Ibrahim replied :— a I have received your letter, and its contents understood. We have not made aggression on our brother, Syud Toorkee, by hostilities. Our advance on Mesnaah is merely through what has happened between us from old. We have not commenced any new quarrel. And about the plundering of the banians' houses and property, know that we have not damaged or caused the least injury to your subjects or their property; the loss has been caused by those in the fort. You can ask your subjects whether 1 have not myself protected their property, and this is because they are your dependants and on accftunt of tlie greatness of the British Gov ernment, and you and we are one.' Major Miles again addressed the following letter to Ibrahim on the lOtli March:— “ Your letter has been received, and with regard to your remarks as to the rebellious attitude assumed by you against His Highness the Sultan Syud Toorkee, I have to inform you that your hostile proceedings cannot be countenanced, but that they are viewed with displeasure by the British Government. “ Secondly .—Your explanations with regard to the plunder of banian's houses are unsatis factory and cannot be accepted, as these banians have undoubtedly been plundered by your men and not by those in the fort, I therefore hereby require that some arrangement be come to con cerning the losses sustained by them and amounting to about Dollars seven thousand and live hundred within two days from this time, failing which you will be considered as an enemy of the British Government and treated accordingly. “ Thirdly .—I inform you that there is property within the fort belonging to British subjects, and I intend to remove this to the ship at 3 p.M. to-day, 1 therefore require you to withdraw your men one mile from the shore for the purpose of allowing this to be done peaceably, and I request an immediate answer from you as to whether you intend to withdraw your men or not, as in the event of your declining to do so the shore will be cleared by the guns of the ship. The boat taking this will wait one hour for your answer. “ fourthly .—I inform you that yesterday the boats conveying my letter to you were tired upon by your men, and I require an explanation and apology from you for this outrage on the British flag.' To which he received the following reply on the same day :— “ Your letter has been received, and I have understood what is in it about the banians' houses and about their property; we have not interfered with them in any way, because they are the subjects of the great Government. Ask themselves if they say we took their property, they shall have satisfaction out of respect to the Government, and nothing shall remain due to them, and if it becomes plain that others did this, then you are the judges. “ Our intention never is to plunder your subjects, and concerning ourselves and our brother Toorkee bin Saeed, this is an old matter between us and was also between our ancestors, and with regard to your landing at the fort and removing thence the banians’ property there is no objection. You are not forbidden the country. Whatever you wish to take out belong ing to the banyans it is in your hands to do as you wish, and no one among us will offer any resistance to you in this, and we will place some one on our behalf that no one shall interfere with; you and we are one. And for all of your subjects there is respect and honor. And about the firing on your boats yesterday, this was done by ignorant and stupid men, and no account should be taken of them, because they did not know that you were landing, but thought that it was some of Syud Toorkee’s men in the ship, and when it was known that it was your ship we ordered our men not to interfere with you. You can land whenever you please and no one shall offer any hindrance to you whatever.' The property in the fort Was, with the exception of a few bales of cotton, safely removed on board the Philomel. On the morning of the 12th Major Miles perceived signs of the garrison being about to surrender, and he accordingly addressed the following letter to Ibrahim:— “ I observe this morning that there are indications of your taking possession of the fort, and it is therefore my duty to inform you that as Government do not countenance your pro ceedings you cannot be allowed to hold the fort until the orders of Government have been received. I therefore require you to desist ani withdraw from the fort at once if in your possession, otherwise it will be necessary for me to dislodge you by force. And some of the property of the banians is still in the fort, for which I must hold you responsible.”Ibrahim replied that the fort bad surrendered to him spontaneously. Matters were getting serious and on the 12th March Major Miles ordered Ibra him to withdraw in 'the following deeided letter :— “ I am unable to consent that you should retain possession of the fort until orders are received, and I therefore require you to evacuate it by 2 p.m. to-day. Half an hour before that time a signal gun will be fired, and if in the meantime you do not intimate to me your intention of leaving, you will he dislodged by the guns. Should you desire, however, a personal interview on this matter there is safety and protection for you to come and return. “ And with regard to the plunder of the British subjects, the banians are present on board, and I am fully satisfied that their losses have been occasioned by your men, and the time given you for making restitution will expire to-morrow at noon. It has also at this time come to my knowledge that a banian was killed during your attack on the bazaar. This is a most serious matter and will have to be submitted for the consideration and orders of Government. “ I trust you will be wise in both these matters and comply with my requests, and not compel me to act with hostility towards you; and as regards the evacuation of the fort, this letter must be considered as final/’ No answer was returned to this letter within the time allowed, hut a flag was hoisted in the fort as if in defiance. After a certain amount of law had been allowed, Major Miles requested Captain Garforth to dislodge the rebels, and five or six shots were fired which had the desired effect, and the fort was at once cleared. About two hours a letter was received from Ibrahim offering to make reparation for losses to Brtish subjects, provided he was allowed to make enquiries and satisfy himself as to the justness of the claims. To this Major Miles agreed, adding that he would afford him every facility. On the 12th of March Major Miles left Mesnaah arriving at Muscat on the 15th. He found that Toorkee had summoned some of the tribes to his assist ance, intending, when he had gathered together a sufficient force, to proceed in person to Burkah against Ibrahim. The tribes began to collect rapidly at Muscat, but as they were mostly Hinavees it was very doubtful if much depen dence could be placed upon them in operating against Ibrahim. Meanwhile, while Toorkee was hesitating at Muscat, Ibrahim turned his attention to Soweik. Preparations were made by the inhabitants for resistance, and the British subjects having been warned by Major Miles to withdraw removed their property. On the 17th March Colonel Ross, in accordance with telegraphic instructions received from the Government of India, proceeded to Muscat in the Hugh Rose. He called at Burkah, which fort he found still held by Toorkee’s adherents, but Mesnaah was in the hands of Ibrahim, who had left a garrison of his own men there. Colonel Ross arrived at Muscat on the 23rd March and found H. M. S. Rifleman and Rhilomel there. He had an interview with Toorkee which he thus described :— “ I found His flighness reassured to a considerable extent by the assurance of the support of Government, which Major Miles had been empowered to convey. His Highness was, however, by no means free from anxiety, chiefly caused by his dread of treachery amongst his own declared adherents. Under the circumstances, His Highness did not feel it expedient to attack the enemy on the Batinah, and believing there was much cause for his distrust of the Ilinavees, I refrained from urging His Highness to proceed against the rebels. It was His Highness’ opinion that immediate danger from the late rebellion had passed, and that dis sensions had occurred between Ibrahim bin Ghais and his allies, the Yal Saad. Major Miles’ operations at Mesnaah probably conduced to this. His Highness’ plan was now to depute the Chief of the A1 \\ ahibeh tribe, Hameyd bin Khalefeen, to the Batinah to effect an arrange ment with the rebels by negotiation. “ I proceeded to consult with His Highness regarding the exaction of reparation from Ibrahim and his followers on account of the plunder of British subjects at Mesnaah. His Highness considered that the Yal Saad tribe should be held responsible equally with Ibrahim. In fact the latter had risen solely at their invitation, and they were the persons amongst whom the spoil had been shared. I then asked His Highness if he would take active ste^s by land to obtain the redress we demanded, offering to co-operate with the ships. His Highness was desirous of trying the effect of negotiation as before stated, and informed me that he would make the payment of the required compensation the first and essential condition of peace with 5253 o the offenders. I earnestly desired His Highness not to come to terms to the exclusion of our demands, and to instruct his agents on the Batinah Coast to that effect. His Highness was himself well aware of the necessity for this caution. “ I then explained to His Hig hness the position of affairs as regarded the proceedings of Ibrahim at Mesnaah, to which place I was about to proceed with a naval force. I ascertained that His Highness was highly desirous of the destruction of that fort, and considered that measure would strengthen his policy and add to his influence. His Highness' view is that the existence of such forts on the Batinah, where disaffection always lurks, is one chief cause of the frequent rebellions and risings in that part of his dominions. As the sea-port of Rostak, also, it would always be coveted and probably held against His Highness by Ibrahim or others of the rival branch of His Highness' family.' On the same day (March 23rd) Colonel Hoss wrote to Ibrahim renewing the demands for compensation, and informing him that he was about to proceed to Mesnaah. Colonel Itoss accompanied by Major Miles arrived at Mesnaah on the 2Gth March in the Hugh Hose, and on arrival found that H. M. S. Rifleman and Philomel had arrived there on the previous day. Negotiations were commenced with Ibrahim, but without effect, and on the 27th Colonel Itoss considered it advisable to address Ibrahim requesting him to withdraw his men from Mesnaali by one o’clock of that day, informing him of his resolve to destroy the fort, irrespective of the pecuniary demands on account of the plunder of British subjects. This course of action Colonel Boss considered absolutely necessary, first, to prevent a recurrence of the defiant proceedings of the rebels in re-occupying the fort after Major Miles’ departure on the 12th March; secondly, because the opportunity was an excellent one for furthering the policy of Sultan and strengthening his position; and thirdly, because a practical exhibition of power and force was indispensably requisite on account of the repeated instance of outrages com mitted on British subjects. At noon on the 27th of March the fort was completely evacuated and a bombardment followed, which after a couple of hours resulted in so far dismant ling the fort as .to render it untenable. After an interval of 21 hours Colonel Boss returned to Muscat accompanied by Major Miles leaving II. M. S. Philomel before Mesnaah. On the 29th Colonel Boss had an interview with Toorkee, who naturally expressed himself extremely pleased with what had been done. Meantime Toorkee, in order to bring about a reconciliation, accepted the offer made by Mahomed bin Seleyim, the Chief Metowa or religious leader in the Batinah, to mediate between His Highn ss and Ibrahim. These negoti ations were entirely fruitless, as Ibrahfrn’s party insisted (1) that Toorkee should pay the compensation for the plunder of the British subjects; (2) that he should fix a pension for Ibrahim ; (3) that he should allow Ibrahim to return and reside at Bostak; and (4) that Mesnaah should not he occupied by either of the opposite factions. On the 4th of April Toorkee received a letter from the Wullee of Burkah stating that Ibrahim had left Mesnaah and was on his way to attack Burkah. Toorkee immediately proceeded thither with 100 ' Wahabees on his corvette the Rahmanee, having previously directed Ilamed bin Khalifeen to co-operate by land. Toorkee, however, on arriving at Burkah found that the report was untrue, and that Ibrahim was still at Mesnaah. A\ ith the view of recommencing negotiations with him, lie despatched Ilamed bin Khalifeen to Mesnaah. The results of these negotiations were not satisfactory. Ibrahim adhered generally to the conditions previously proposed by him with the exception that he offered to pay half the indemnity of $15,000 on account of compensation to British subjects instead of requiring Toorkee to pay the whole of it. Toorkee returned to Muscat on the 18th April, having left affairs in the Batinah in statu quo. On the 16th May Major Miles reported that Ibrahim had returned to El-Bostak and did not appear to contemplate any new move ment for the present. The Yal Saad tribe, who were the supporters of Ibrahim, had made a raid in Soweik, but met with a repulse. A fresh attack was expected and Toorkee despatched on the 14th of May a reinforcement of M ahabees to the Wullee’s assistance. Meanwhile negotiations by Toorkee were attempted with the Yal Saad, but without success, as the terms offered were not such as Toorkee considered that he could with honor accept.273. Attack made by the Yal Saad on Soweik— The YalSaad * From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, dated Continued * tlieil* attacks OH Soweik, and at 12 th June 1874, No. 761155 . the end of May Major Miles reported that the place was closely infested by two clans of that tribe. Endeavours were made by Toorkee to effect a reconciliation with the Yal Saad, but without success. Major Miles wrote on the 24th May :— “ He (i.e., Toorkee) is no doubt anxious to conclude negotiations with the Yal Saad, and would, 1 believe, be glad if our operations against that tribe to compel payment of the indemnity were commenced without much delay.” The two conditions in which Toorkee professed to insist as absolutely necessary to any negotiation were (1) that the demands of the British Government should be complied With, and (2) that the fort at Mesnaah should be restored. On the 6th June Major Miles telegraphed to*Colonel Boss that the Yal From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, dated 12th Saad had Captllicd aild JllimdCFCd With June 1874, No. 765-159. bazar at Soweik, also that Toorkee had solicited the support of Government, and requested him to require the rebels to withdraw*. Major Miles therefore left Muscat for Sowxnk in the Magpie. accompanied by one of Toorkee’s officers deputed by His Highness for that purpose, and on arrival there found the position of affairs desperate. He called upon the rebels to desist from hostilities at once and .withdraw from the vicinity. At first they demurred, but afterwards marched off. The Magie remained at Soweik until the 10th of June leaving the tow r n and bazar in the posses sion of the Commandant of the Fort and without any apparent sign of the rebels. No loss or injury occurred to British interests from the temporary possession of the bazar by the insurgents, as all the banians and other Indian subjects had been, by the orders of Major Miles, removed from Soweik some time previously. Mean time Toorkee (so Major Miles telegraphed to Colonel Boss) made no special pre parations for co-operation by land, the probable reason being the w r ant of funds. On the 9th June Major Miles, then at Jask, telegraphed to Colonel Boss that Toorkee w*as much more inclined to temporize and negotiate with the rebels than to use force. He said :— “ Yours of to-day. Syud Toorkee was very anxious that we should act against Yal Saad as stated in my telegram of 5th, and he doubtless has reasons. He is much more inclined to temporize and negotiate with rebels about his own affairs than to use force, and he will require to be urged to co-operate with us at all by land whether we act sooner or later. He is as much prepared now as he is likely to be without pressing. I have no reasons of my own for hasten ing or delaying operations as originally planned,, but it might be advisable to meet Toorkee’s desire on the subject. I am anxious to return Muscat to catch Mail Steamer, but will wait at Jask till to-morrow morning to receive your instructions.” Meanwhile, on the 6th J une, Colonel Boss reported by telegraph to the Government of India Major Miles’ proceedings at Soweik. On the 10th of June the Government of India enquired by telegram wdiat prospect Toorkee had of maintaining his rule, to which on the 11th of June Colonel Boss replied:— “ There is no special danger at present to the Sultan’s rule. With continuous support of Government, he may remain as now for an indefinite period. But he is relying chiefly on that support and on the effect thereof upon Arabs. His hold of power is generally insecure, and would not be lastftig long if British aid withdrew.” [Poltl. A., June 1874, Nos. 269-270.] Colonel Boss was on the 13th June directed by telegram to continue to act in regard to support of Toorkee, accord ing to instructions in telegram dated 20th January last which were given in the case of Saleh bin Ali (see paragraph 265 ante). {Poltl. A., March 1874, No. 207.] “ You have full powers to help Toorkee actively so far as guns of vessels of war will reach and to pro tect British interests. Undertake no operations on shore.” 4 V 274. Compensation on account of plunder of British subjects at Mesnaah. —Colonel Boss writing on the 1st of April, after the bombardment of Mesnaah, expressed his opinion that it would be advisable to 5455 % * await the result of Toorkee’s negotiations, which were to include a demand for satisfaction of British claims before taking measures to demand bequest of com pensation, the amount of which had been fixed at $15,000. Previous enquiries having established beyond a doubt that the Yal Saad who formed the main body of the insurgents were the chief culprits and support of Ibrahim, Colonel Boss found it necessary to hold that tribe responsible conjointly with Ibrahim for the payment of this amount, and he addressed the tribe accordingly. On the ]st of April Colonel Boss accompanied by Major Miles proceeded from Muscat to Mesnaah in the Hugh Jiose in view of affording Ibrahim and his adherents an opportunity of communicating with him regardingthe payment of the claims for compensation. The result of these communications was that Colonel Boss on the 2nd of April agreed to allow Ibrahim and the Yal Saad ten days to arrange for payment. Colonel Boss added in communicating this decision to Ibrahim :— “ If at the end of 10 days you have not arranged to satisfy our demands, further active steps must be taken by us, so I trust you and all concerned will have wisdom to see it is your interest to comply.” Colonel Boss also required him to refrain from any operations against Toorkee. On the 15th of April Ibrahim wrote to Major Miles declaring on behalf of himself and the lal Saad that it was not possible to arrange for payment of the full compensation, but that he would endeavour to pay part of the amount, but this request was refused by Major Miles. [ Political A., June 1874, Nos. 252--? 77. ] In reporting these proceedings Major Miles forwarded the following memo randum on the subject:— “ The time granted to Syud Ibrahim and the rebel tribes allied with him in which to make reparation for injuries sustained by British subjects at their hands during the attack on Mesnaah having expired, it is desirable to sketch the position of affairs with reference to the practicability of coercing the rebel Arabs and exacting the reparation which they have refused to give. “The principal tribe which co-operated with Syud Ibrahim in his attack on the fort of Mesnaah and was actually engaged in the plunder of British subjects was the Yal Saad, which is probably the most numerous tribe in the whole principality of Oman and by far the'laro’est in the Batinah, approximating ten thousand men. There were also a few of the El Hidadebeh, Yal Khamis, and El Ghawarib concerned in the movement. It is believed that Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais endeavoured to protect the banians from plunder by his men as much as possible, but his efforts were unavailing. As the leader of the enterprise however he is of course responsible with the Yal Saad in the matter. The Y r al Saad in spite of their numbers have no great reputation in warfare and consequently have not so much influence politically as they otherwise naturally would have. They are, however, not averse to a little plunder when it can be easily obtained. They are held to be a very wealthy tribe, being chiefly engaged in the cultivation of their extensive date groves, the produce of which is largely exported, mostly in their own vessels, to the ports of the Persian Gulf, Mekran, and Yemen. The largest town belonging to them, and indeed in the Batinah, is Muhidda, which is situate about five miles from the sea behind Shirs. It is strongly walled, but without bastions, and has a few small guns mounted on it. These fortifi cations were erected in 1861 after the severe punishment inflicted on this tribe by the Sultan Syud Thoweynee. Other towns possessed by the Yal Saad inland are Tureef, Soor Thurmud and Soor Girat, and on the shore Wadam, El Khadhra, and Soor Wilad, El Heyiz. Their prin cipal port is Wadam (including a nearly contiguous walled bazar called Soor El Makaneeat), where they carry on their trade and in which are their godowns containing valuable property. “ The habitable part of the Batinah is along the whole shore of it from Heyl to Khor Eakan, and does not extend more than from two to five miles from the sea. “ The Batinah thus presents a thickly peopled and continuous belt of palm trees, forts villages, gardens, and cultivation for upwards of one hundred and fifty miles, the interior being barren and hilly and covered with their acacia jungle. The tribe Yal* Saad extend about twenty-five miles along this coast. “ It will thus be seen that there is no part of Arabia more vulnerable from the sea than the Batinah Coast, and that the offending tribes in this instance are peculiarly accessible to us. Should, therefore, they continue to refuse compliance with just demands, and should it conse quently be deemed necessary to undertake operations against them, I would respectfully sug gest that in the first place, after due warning, the fort and bazars of Wadam and Khadhra56 should be bombarded and destroyed, and all craft found within the limits of the Yal Saad should be confiscated or burnt. Should these measures prove ineffective it would be necessary to blockade that part of the coast until the tribe submitted. 1 # t* “In order to carry out these operations effectually I consider that two men of war would be necessary. It would be very advisable, I submit, to commence active measures against these tribes at once and bring them to compliance if possible before the hot weather sets in, as the maintenance of a blockade during that season would probably be extremely irksome to Royal Navy vessels.” Colonel Ross in forwarding this on the 2nd May w rote:— “One reason for holding the Yal Saad tribe responsible conjointly with their leader Ibra him was that, whilst Ibrahim’s position is such that he can at pleasure withdraw to Rostak, where he is inaccessible as far as naval force is concerned, he has no property on the sea-coast, and consequently we have no means without co-operation of a land force of coercing him. The Yal Saad tribe, as will be seen from a perusal of Major Miles’ able report, are to a great extent open to coercion from the seaward. There is no injustice in suiting own convenience by acting against them rather than Ibrahim, because they were in reality the culprits far more to blame I believe than their leader Ibrahim. They were made fully to understand that we reserved the option of enforcing the whole demand either from Ibrahim or from the tribe. “ Payment not having been made in the required time, both Ibrahim bin Ghais and the Yal Saad tribe are, in accordance with the declarations I have issued to them, in the position of enemies of the British Government and liable to treatment as such without further warnino*. “I respectfully submit to Government that further active measures will (unless speedy satisfaction is given) be highly necessary. This granted it remains only to consider the nature and extent of the operations to be undertaken, the time which should be fixed for carrving them into execution, and the force to be employed. “ As to tbe first question, I am of opinion that it should be decided to act against the Yal Saad with a naval force with or without co-operation by land on the part of His Highness the Sultan as circumstances may determine. The suggestions made by Major Miles are, I think, good, viz., that the forts of Wadam and Khadhra should in the first place suffer bombardment and be destroyed, and all vessels of the Yal Saad confiscated or burnt, and their coast blockaded. “ As to the time for these proposed operations there does not seem any urgent reason for immediate action, whilst 1 see reasons in favor of some delay. Such serious steps should, when possible, be well considered beforehand and be well concerted in order to ensure success. At the present time hostilities would be less grievously felt by the Yal Saad tribe than they would be, say, two months later, both because of their harvest time, and because their boats are away now. For these reasons His Highness Syud Toorkee has recommended delay. Another con sideration is that just now His Highness is utterly unable to co-operate by land if required to do so; whilst there is at least a possibility that measures now contemplated may give a favour able turn to His Highness’ affairs, and that a few months hence His Highness might be able to take advantage of the opportunity to strike a blow. Further, I am induced to think that this matter impending over,, the hostile faction will give time for Syud Toorkee to seek means of strengthening his Government. It is only the late operations at Mesnaah and the dread of what is still to come that prevented Ibrahim and his adherents taking advantage of Syud Toorkee’s present weak and isolated position. For all these reasons, and most especially in order that full time may be ensured for the consideration of the subject and for the issue of such orders as may be deemed necessary for His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General in Council, it seems to be desirable to reserve action a little. “ I concur with Major Miles in thinking that at least two vessels of the Royal Navy would be required. The Philomel and Rifleman are now on the Gulf Station, but I under stand the latter vessel is anxious to refit and obtain change for the crew. For operations to be complete a force of His Highness the Sultan should decidedly co-operate on shore in the opera tions sketched, but at present it is quite doubtful if Ilis Highness will be able to assist in this way. “ I have deemed this matter of such importance that it is highly desirable Government should have the full report before them before any further steps are taken, and unless on emer gency I shall await such orders as His Excellency the Viceroy may be pleased to give me. “In conclusion, I must state that whilst thinking it necessary to forward this report without delay, 1 have a strong impression that Ibrahim bin Ghais and his friends will collect and pay the amount demanded before we commence to act against them. If they really mean to strike vigorously for possession of Muscat, such payment will be the first step towards it.” On the lltli May Major Miles reported that Ibrahim had asked for a further delay of some months in order to collect and pay in the amount of com pensation. Major Miles replied to he had no authority to grant any extension of time, and suggested that he should communicate with Colonel Ross.* • * V — # On the 1st June Colonel Ross telegraphed that he considered the time had come for coercive measures against the Yal Saad, and again on the 9th June he telegraphed that Ibrahim had proposed to pay the indemnity by yearly instalments, and that the Yal Saad had decfhred Ibrahim to be responsible. Colonel lloss added— “ I consider neither the offer of Ibrahim nor the excuse of the Yal Saad should be accepted.^ With reference to these telegrams, the following instructions were issued to the Resident on the 10th June :— “ Report reasons for refusing to accept indemnity from Ibrahim bin Ghais by yearly instalments or in reasonable periods. Do not bombard or make armed reprisals on account of indemnity until further orders.” To which the Resident replied on the 11th :— “ If Ibrahim’s proposals for settlement of claims were accepted, it would relieve the \al Saad rebels of further responsibility, and they would escape necessity of making reparation. This tribe were the actual plunderers and should, I consider, be made to disgorge or to suffer some severity of procedure as 1 think necessary, otherwise similar losses to British subjects may frequently occur. If such delay as Ibrahim suggests were granted, it is improbable the claims would ever be paid, as unless with contribution from Yal Saad, Ibrahim have no means to pay, and unless pressed by us Yal Saad will not conti’ibute. I shall be most careful to take no active steps until further orders, and shall defer proceeding to Muscat, but I am convinced strong measures would be most appropriate in this case.” On the 13th, the Government of India replied :— “ As you are convinced that strong measures are needed, they may be carried out to the extent of enforcing any terms that you judge reasonable and necessary. Viceroy would be glad if fair indemnity could be arranged without resort to extreme reprisals.” Thus the matter stands at present. Major Miles has warned Ibrahim and the Sheikhs of the Y r al Saad that Political Resident’s No. 760 - 154 , dated 12 th June they are liable to be attacked by us w ithout 1874 - further warning. Meanwhile the Govern ment of India are awaiting a report which Colonel Ross has promised to furnish after personal consultation with Syud Toorkee :— “ With regard to the indemnity to be recovered from Ibrahim bin Ghais and his adherents, I am proceeding to Muscat to confer with His Highness the Sultan and Major Miles on that and other subjects, and I shall endeavour to procure a satisfactoiy arrangement of that matter in accordance with the instructions and wishes of His Excellency the Viceroy conveyed in your telegram of the 13th June.” [Letter from Political Resident, No. 82-1-166, dated 25/// Junei] [Political A,, July 1874, Nos. 291-308.] 57 * p ItSECTION V.

Views of Colonel Ross and Major Miles on the subject. Gov ernment of India sanction his return— On the 6th March Major Miles wrote:— “ His Highness the Sultan Syud Toorkee did me the honor to pay me a visit on the 3rd instant. He said he had come to speak with me about abdicating the Sultanate of Oman and retiring' to Gwadur, where he could reside in peace ; as he felt unable to cope with his enemies any longer. His Highness said that it was not a year yet since Sir B. I’rere had visited him, and he had since disbursed 1,50,000 Dollars in subsidizing his people, but that instead of being grateful they had only become more insubordinate and rapacious than ever, and he was greatly mortified and discouraged at their conduct towards him. He would show me the list given to his brother, Syud Thoweynee, by his father, Syud Saeed, when he went to Zanzibar, and I should see how enormously the subsidies to be paid to the various tribes had been increased by himself. His Highness added that even the Ghafirees were now setting themselves in opposi tion to him, and were talking now of setting up the sons of Jobber. Saleh bin Ali too, not withstanding his protestations to the contraiy, was meditating another rising. “In reply, I endeavoured to reassure and encourage His Highness by saying'that as he was aware Government had decided to give him active support against rebels, that he had their fullest sympathy; and I was sure they would be greatly concerned to hear the view he took of his position. I also pointed out that the two rivals of his own family, Syud Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim, were now out of the way and disposed of, and that I was not aware there were any fresh grounds for serious apprehension at present. His Highness said he would wait and see what course events took, and that he would recur to the subject on another occasion. “The following day I paid a visit to His Highness, and recurring to the subject of his political position with reference to internal dissensions, I mentioned how extremely advantageous it would be for him to appoint some trustworthy and responsible person as Vizier under present circumstances, as in bearing the whole weight of the administration he was undertaking a task beyond his powers, especially in his present weak state of health. I pointed out too, with regard to the exorbitant subsidies demanded by the tribes, how much more easily and effectually a skilful Minister could check and diminish these expenses than His Highness, who was too ready to yield to the Arab’s exactions. I further took the occasion to remind His Highness of the advice tendered by you to him on the same subject during your recent visit here. His H ighness informed me that he depended a good deal on the advice and counsel of one Ibrahim el Aiwese, the Wahabee Jemadar, and that he considered him an able man. He added also that he felt the weight of what I had said, as he was sure I was advising him for his good, and that he would consider seriously of it. “ My reasons for tendering this advice to His Highness were the knowledge that he is surrounded by men who are incapable of giving him sound and judicious advice with the excep tion perhaps of this man Ibrahim, and the opinion also that His Highness does not sufficiently take into counsel the leading and most influential men in Muscat, viz., his own relatives. These personages are not, I believe, very well inclined to His Highness, but still there is no doubt that a more intimate communication with them would go far to reconcile them and their party, and His Highness’ influence would certainly not be decreased thereby. I feel convinced moreover that an able and influential Minister would at the present time without difficulty be able so to conciliate and pacify rival factions as to turn the tide in Syud Toorkee’s favour, and that these internal dissensions and harassing demonstrations would be at an end. For it is cer tain that the country has never had a more considerate and openhaaded ruler than the present Sultan, and there are no real grievances whatever to complain of.” On the 16th April Toorkee thus wrote in the following terras to Major Miles:— “ It is not kept from you that as before- informed, my friend, Colonel Ross, has been always advising and urging me to allow the presence of Syud Abdool Azeez, and saying that you would reconcile us to each other, and that he should be under my orders and be my General, and I have always been thinking of this, and I now see that your views are correct in this matter, especially in these days when I am not in good health, and am powerless against the opposite party, and our Government is now in want of his presence if you will stand security for him in his doings, and that he should listen to the advice of both of us (British Government and Toorkee) and not to the ill-disposed. And my request is that you should write for his presence, and I shall be to him as is my custom.” \59 V • ^ On the 17th April Major Miles wrote regarding this letter:— “The Sultan’s last letter to me was received this morning-. In it His Highness states that he has come to the conclusion that it would be best to recall his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, from Kurrachee, and associate him with himself in the government of the country, as he feels powerless to stand alone any longer. His Highness appears to be under some misapprehension with regard to the advice he has received on this subject, as I am not aware that I ever even spoke favorably of the project before him, and it is one moreover the expedi ency of which at the present moment seems very doubtful. “ His Highness, though I am sure, would never have resolved on sending for his brother* Abdool Azeez, whom he greatly mistrusts, had he not become convinced that he was in a very serious and critical position. What His Highness’ plans are now I am not aware, and in truth 1 doubt if he has any; he has given up negotiating, and is not preparing a force to attack Ibrahim at present. The fact is, I believe, that in courting the Hinavees, as he has done lately, he has estranged most of his old friends the Ghafirees, and he now finds that the Hinavees will not really fight, but have merely flocked round him to secure his money and presents. In the meantime His Highness has been spending his resources and now feels himself embarrassed how to act.” Colonel Ross writing on the 2nd May added:— “ The proposal of His Highness to send for his brother, Abdool Azeez, was unexpected, and I deemed it advisable to proceed to Muscat to see His Highness on the subject. “ It will be observed that His Highness states in his letter to Major Miles on this subject that I have advised and urged this measure. This, however, is a misapprehension on His Highness’ part, which has probably arisen from my putting the question to him, in accordance with the instructions contained in Mr. Aitchison’s letter No. 9yP., paragraph 3.* On that occasion I did not advocate the step which indeed I was averse from at that time. Once also, when urging His Highness to appoint a suitable and responsible Minister, I believe I mentioned his brother’s name amongst several others, but merely as a query. * With regard to the first request His Excellency in Council fears that there is not much chance of a reconciliation with Toorkee, but to remove all ground of complaint on the part of Abdool Azeez the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf will be asked to consult His Highness on the subject and report the result. [Political A., January 1874, Wo. 210.] “The proposal must be considered as entirely emanating from His Highness. On this account, and also from what I saw of the way His Highness’ affairs were drifting of late, I considered that if it turned out to be a fixed idea and not a mere passing \fhim the proposal should be carried into effect if possible. “ Having reached Muscat on the 29th April I waited on His Highness and found him still desirous of having his brother on certain conditions. “ The following day having received your telegram of 27th April, approving the proposal with the proviso that no guarantee should be given regarding Abdool Azeez’s conduct towards H is Highness or vice versa, I had another interview with the Sultan, when I informed His Highness that agreeably to his expressed desire I was ready to mediate between himself and his brother, Abdool Azeez, in view to a reconcilation. That if Abdool Azeez agreed on his side, I would take his assent in writing to such proposals as were agreed on. But I gave His Highness distinctly to understand that Government cannot give any guarantee for Abdool Azeez’s conduct towards His Highness after he had landed at Muscat, and could not be res ponsible in that matter. If His Highness desired my good offices on this understanding, I informed him I proposed to proceed to Kurrachee, and if Abdool Azeez gave the necessary promises, I would bring him to Muscat. His Highness at first said that the guarantee of Government was indispensable, but on it being explained to him that it was impossible for Government to give such a guarantee, His Highness eventually desired me to take the matter up and proceed with it. 1 accordingly requested His Highness to prepare a letter to his brother which should be entursted to me, and which I would deliver or not as circumstances might determine, and also to inform me of the terms on which he would receive Abdool Azeez. I ascertained that His Highness meant to associate Abdool Azeez with him as his Minister or on occasion his Naib or deputy, and not to admit him to any higher share in the Gvernment. \ “ I came to Muscat imbued with the idea that Syud Toorkee’s position absolutely demanded the presence of some competent assistant in the Government, partly because of his physical incapacity to carry out necessary measures. On arrival I found matters in a far worse state than I 'had anticipated, and so very precarious that the time was passed for any hesitation in sending for Abdool Azeez. “ His Highness has estranged almost every person in the country capable of advising and assisting him, and is guided almost solely by the advice of one or two worthless favorites who have gained his ear. Worse than this he has lately with incredible weakness lavished his funds on persons like Hamed bin Khalif&lt;|en, of the A1 Wahibeh, whom His Highness knowsto be at heart traitor to his cause. By this fatal trimming- policy he has managed to estrange the whole Ghafiree side, and as the Hinavees will not really fire a shot tor him at a push he has actually no one to look to for help. In this worse than useless mannei all his funds have been squandered. Under these painful circumstances it is not surprising that it is the universal opinion of every intelligent person in the country that Syud loorkee must succumb to the first serious attack. Furthermore, this is His Highness own opinion. He repeatedly informed me that the dynasty of his family was worn out, had come to the end of their power, and must give way to another. Ills Highness also said that he is no longei the Rule:-, but only the Vakeel or Agent of the Arabs. Major Miles has at my request favored me with a memorandum on the subject of His Highness* present position, of which X attach a copy. I concur on the whole with the opinions of the Political Agent. “ Under these circumstances, the only remedy which presents itself is that proposed by His Hi o* hness himself, namely, obtaining the assistance of Abdool Azeez. The immediate effect of this measure will doubtless be favorable. It will give satisfaction to many of the Arabs, and Abdool Azeeez’s personal energy will be of great use to His Highness. Major Miles is much averse from this measure except as a pis aller, but agrees with me in thinking that in absence of any better plan it is now a necessity. « Yesterday, the 1st of May, having obtained the required document, I took leave of His Highness Syud Toorkee and embarked in the May Frere and weighed for Kurrachee. After arrival there, and communication with the Commissioner in Sind and Abdool Azeez, I shall report further.** On 1st May Major Miles wrote “ His Highness then recurred to the subject on which he had written to me, viz., the asso ciation with himself in the government of his brother, Abdool Azeez, observing that the time had arrived for a reconciliation between them, as His Highness felt unable any longer to bear the burden of rule alone and unsupported, and that the presence of his brother appeared to him to be essential to the maintenance and stability of his own position and for the insurance of the Sultanate to the family of the late Syud Saeed. His Highness trusted, however, that the British Government would extend their favours so far as to take a guarantee from Syud Abdool Azeez that he would conduct himself subordinately to His Highess, and refrain from intriguing or acting against him in the event of his being alknved to return. His Highness Syud Toorkee said he considered the taking of security from Abdool Azeez by Government as an indispensable condition, as knowing the character of his brother he could repose no trust or confidence in him without some guarantee for his good faith and behaviour. “ Having htid some experience myself of Syud Azeez’s character, I did not approve or encourage His Highness* scheme in*any way, and I took occasion to point out that His High ness had appeared to have misapprehended the tenor of your communication to him during your last visit relative to the return of Syud Abdool Azeez.** [Poltl. A., June 1874, Nos. 259-260.] Meanwhile, on the 21st April 1874, Colonel Ross had telegraphed to the Government of India regarding Toorkee’s wish for the return of Abdool Azeez. \Poltl. A., April 1874, No. 246.] On the 27th April the Government of India had telegraphed in reply conveying general approval, hut adding :— “ Necessary to be cautious not to commit Government to any guarantee either of conduct of Abdool Azeez towards Toorkee, or vice versa.” [Poltl. A., April 1874, No. 247.] On the 4th May Colonel Ross telegraphed:— “ Abdool Azeez having agreed to all conditions for reconciliation imposed by Syud Toorkee, I propose to take him back with me in May Frere to Muscat on 6 th. No guarantee given on part of Government either way. Solicit necessary sanction for Abdool Azeez*s release being telegraphed to Commissioner.** [Poltl. A., May 1874, No. 16.] Accordingly the Government of India on the 6th May telegraphed to the Commissioner in Sind :— “ Arrangements with Abdool Azeez judiciously made by Ross and completed to-day. Ross leaves with Abdool Azeez to-day.** [Poltl. A., May 1874, No. 17.] 6061 Q On the 12th May Colonel Ross telegraphed :— “ I landed Abdool Azeez at Muscat ori 10th. His reception by Sultan was very cordial, and the reconciliation has somewhat restored confidence. Mesnaah claims seem likely to be paid. Am proceeding round Arab Coast to Bushire.” [Poltl. A., June 1874, No. 203.] 276. Memorandum by Major Miles on Toorkee’s position generally in May 1874. —On the same date, May 1st, as showing the precarious position in which Toorkee then was. Major Miles forwarded the following memorandum:— “From the time of His Highness Syud Toorkee’s illness in January the weakness of his rule and extreme precariousness of his position have become painfully apparent and have ever since continued to increase. “ The successful raid of Sheikh Saleh bin Ali and more particularly the recent operations of Ibrahim bin Ghais in the Batinah have demonstrated this most conclusively, and there can be no question that His Highness’ position is new highly critical, and that without a vigorous effort on his part in some direction the tenure of power cannot long remain in his hands. “ I believe that had it not been for our demonstration against Mesnaah in March last, Syud Ibrahim would have been at this moment in Muscat and Syud Toorkee a fugitive, unless of course he had been forcibly sustained by us. “ There may be many reasons to account for Syud Toorkee’s present position, but in my opinion the chief are His Highness’ small capacity for administration, the entire absence of sincere friends and good advisers to whom he could look, and the reckless waste of his pecuni ary resources. “ During the last eighteen months His Highness has not had a single able and influential adviser near him on whom he could depend, and most of his friends have become gradually estranged. “In addition to his usual revenues His Highness has received since April 1873 from this Treasury $100,000, nearly the whole of which has been expended in endeavours to pacify the tribes, but the beneficial results of this expenditure may be considered as nil. He has also received an advance up to July 1874 and has had to borrow money from Bombay. He has thus no funds in reserve whatever to meet an emergency. “ His Highness has lately adopted a conciliatory poficy towards the Hinavees, and it was very successful so long as he subsidized them largely, but both the Ghafirees and Hinavees appear to be standing aloof from him at the present moment, and are wavering and quite ready to join any party that will pay. them. Notwithstanding all this, however, the return of Syud Abdool Azeez to Muscat and his association with Syud Toorkee in the government is a measure the expediency of which I consider is extremely doubtful, and one which I shquld be sorry to advocate were it in any way avoidable. Syud Toorkee’s cause though may be looked upon as hopeless, the power has fallen from his grasp, and if we would still endeavour to sustain him, it must be by some strong measure. The installation of Abdool Azeez is of this nature, and desperate remedy though 1 deem it to be, I look upon it as a necessity.” [Poltl. A., June 1874, No. 260.] 277. Conditions under which Abdool Azeez was allowed to return to Muscat. His conduct at Muscat reported to be satisfactory. —The conditions accepted by Abdool Azeez were set forth in the following agreement, to which Abdool Azeez’s signature was attached before he left Kurrachee :— “ His Highness, my brother, Syud Toorkee bin Saeed bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat, having intimated his wish for my return to Muscat on terms of reconciliation and sincere brotherly friendship honorable to us both on condition of my agreeing to observe the following terms:— “ Ut. —It is necessary that your heart and friendship be sincere, and that you will be in unity with me and your conduct towards me be good. “ —Put away all evil from your heart and neither listen to the evil disposed nor regard anything detrimental towards our Government. “ 3 /v/.—Pay no attention to tale-bearers or strife-makers because from them conies enmity and estrangement between us.62 « 4 //&amp;—If you consider anything advisable and I disapprove of it, you must give it up without being offended. . « 5 ^. If tale-bearers tell you anything that makes you unhappy for the purpose of causing separation between us, it is necessary that you inform me and not conceal it so that we may consult al)out it together. “ I Svud Abdool Azeez bin Saeed bin Sultan, hereby give my free and full promise to observe these terms, which I accept without reservation or exception in any respect, « On receivin'’- permission from Her Majesty's Government of India to return to Muscat on the above conditions, I further hereby solemnly declare and promise on my honor and faith that during the lifetime of my brother, Syud Toorkee, and his reign as Sultan of Muscat, I will be faithful to him as Ruler, will never attempt to usurp Ins position, nor in any way sanction intrigues against his authority, but will do my best to uphold his Government and power. «I a l S o promise that, under all circumstances, I will do all in my power to carry out and maintain all treaties and arrangements now existing between the British Government and the Sultan of Muscat, and will on no consideration act contrary to the advise of the British Government and its representatives. “The above promises I now make freely and sincerely in presence of Sir William Merewether, K.C.S.I. and C.B., Commissioner in Sind, and of Colonel Ross, Political Resident, and hereunto set my hand and seal this 5th day of May 1874.' From Colonel Hoss 5 letter dated 13th May, it appears that Toorkee’s reception of his brother was most cordial. On the 10th May Major Miles reported that Abdool Azeez had been allotted a suitable residence apart from the palace and appeared to remain in frequent communication with Toorkee. Finally in his letter dated 29th May 1874, Major Miles wrote &lt;&lt; A few days ago Syud Abdool Azeez received letters from the Sheikhs of the A1 Wahibeh, Mahomed bin Saeed, Hamood bin Saeed, and Munsoor, saying they had rejoiced to hear of his arrival in Oman and offering him their support in dispossessing Syud loorkee and becoming Sultan himself, but requesting him not to show their letters to Syud loorkee. Under the advice of Mahomed Azan, Syud Abdool Azeez at once handed over these letters to his brother, and replied to the A1 Wahibeh Sheikhs in the spirit of the engagement he had entered into before you.' [Political A., June 1874, No. 266.] [ « * » » » 277.] / 278. The general position of affairs at the present time — * Despatch No. 137, dated 28th July 1874. The whole of the papers liaVC been reported j j oiti. a., July 1874, Nos. 307-8. to the Secretary of State,* and in the last paragraph of the despatch the present position of affairs was thus summarized :— “ The insurrection has for the present collapsed, and Syud Abdool Azeez is associated with his brother, His Highness Syud Toorkee, in the government of Muscat. Regarding the payment of compensation, on account of the plunder of British subjects at Mesnaah, we are awaiting a further report from the Political Resident, who has proceeded to Muscat for the purpose of consulting with His Highness Syud Toorkee. We have authorized Colonel Ross to carry out such strong measures as may be needed to the extent of enforcing any terms that he may judge to be reasonable and necessary, but ^ we have expressed a hope that Colonel Ross may find himself able to arrange for a fair indemnity without resort to extreme reprisals. Throughout these proceedings Colonel Ross and Major Miles have acted under instructions from us. Considering the serious losses British subjects and traders in Oman have suffered by the repeated rebellious and dynastic changes that have distracted the country of late years; considering also how firmly the present Ruler of Muscat has been attached to our interests, the readiness with which he met our views in regard to the slave-trade, and the uncertainty how far similar co-operation could be expected from Ibrahim bin Ghais, who is greatly under the influence of the priestly and fanatical party of Oman, we thought it right, while forbidding our officers to engage in any operations ashore, to comply with Toorkee's request for support, and actively to assist His Highness so far as the guns of our vessels of war can reach.' 13-8-74.

Syud Salim bin Thoweynee, the dispossessed Ruler of Muscat, was still at Kishm, and it was believed that it was the intention of Syud Toorkee to make him a small allowance. The only question therefore in which the British Government was interested was the payment of the compensation by the Yal Saad tribe on account of the losses indicted upon British subjects at Mesnaah, and this narrative will therefore commence with the measures taken to effect the recovery of the amount, which had been fixed at $15,000. 279. Measures taken to effect recovery of the indemnity due by the Yal Saad. —On the 25th July Colonel Ross telegraphed that Proceedings, Political a., August an arrangement had been effected for the payment 1874, No. 257 . of the indemnity within Uiree months, and that the Yal Saad tribe had submitted to Syud Toorkee and the Batinah Coast generally pacificated, without the necessity for recourse to severe measures of reprisal. This satisfactory settlement had been effected in the following manner :— On the 10th July Colonel Ross, having previously arranged with the Proceedings, Political a., August Senior Naval Officer for Her Majesty’s Ships 1874, No. 258. Philomel and Magpie to join him at Muscat, pro ceeded to Burka with Major Miles in the May Fvere. He had already addressed letters to Ibrahim bin Ghais and the Yal Saad tribe, warning them that he was about to proceed in force to the Batinah Coast, and had requested the Sultan to despatch a body of troops under command of his brother, Abdool Azeez, in the corvette Rahmanee. On arrival at Burka (which was held by Syud Toorkee) Abdool Azeez, to whom had been entrusted full powers to negotiate or conclude arrangements in the Sultan’s name, landed, and completed his force to about three hundred and fifty men, and Colonel Ross received replies from Ibrahim bin Ghais and the Yal Saad to the letters he had addressed to them. The former made no reasonable offer, and the latter simply repudiated their responsibility. 280. When, however, the Yal Saad Chiefs became aware of the presence of a force in their neighbourhood, they changed their tone, and sent two Sheikhs to say that they would pay the indemnity and make over Mesnaah to Syud Toorkee. On the 13th the force moved to before Mesrianh, which had been partially repaired and garrisoned by Ibrahim bin Ghais, and several days were occupied in discussions between Syud Abdool Azeez and the Yal Saad Sheikhs. The latter .pleaded that owing to the divisions existing in the tribe and the want, of one acknowledged head, they were unable to combine together to raise the required sum, while, as regarded the fort and town of Mesnaah, they expressed themselves willing that it should be made over to Abdool Azeez, but said that as it was held by a garrison of Ibrahim’s men, they would lend to him requesting its peaceable surrender. 281. On the 18th it was arranged that Abdool Azeoz should land his men, as it was considered advisable that he should bo put in possession of Mesnaah without delay. Owing to a storm arising, the actual landing was not effected till the following day, when, under cover of the men-of-wars’ boats, the fort was occupied by the troops of Abdool Azeez without any opposition64 on the part of the Yal Saad or of the inhabitants. The garrison had blown up a portion of the wall and decamped as soon as the boats began to ino\ e towards the shore. 282. After a long negotiation with the Yal Saad Chiefs, Abdool Azeez recommended that the following terms should be allowed them, viz .:— That these Chiefs should bind themselves and find security to pay the sum of ten thousand dollars within three months. That His Highness the Sultan should take upon himself the remain- j n£y fi ve thousand dollars of indemnity in consideration of the entire submission of°the Yal Saad tribe and their engaging to refrain in future from joining Ibrahim bin Ghais. 283. This latter condition was based on considerations affecting the interests of the Sultan only. Abdool Azeez was of opinion that by acting in this way an obligation would be conferred upon the Yal Saad, which would materially contribute towards a reconciliation with the Batinah tribes and the establish ment of 'cod feeling with*them in future. It would, in fact, make the difference between peace and warfare. Colonel Ross did not therefore deem it advisable to oppose the proposal. He further consented to allow the tribe three months in which to pay the amount to be exacted from them, whilst Abdool Azeez obtained a formal document from the Chiefs binding themselves to pay the amount to him in seventy days. 284. These terms met with the full concurrence of Syud Toorkee, who * expressed himself muck gratified with the result so far as his own interests were concerned. Ibrahim bin Ghais was not included in the arrangements, as Colonel Ross thought it best to abstain from enterirur into any communications with him, and it was hoped that his influence with the Yal Saad would be much impaired. The policy by which Colonel Ross was guided throughout these proceedings was thus explained by him :— “ In dealing with this troublesome affair, I have throughout endeavoured to combine the promotion of His Highness Syud Toorkee’s interest with the attainment of our own object— redress for the plunder of British subjects. This course, though rendering my task somewhat more complicated and delicate, I have thought to be most in accordance with the policy of Government and most conducive to the general good. By acting independently of the Sultan it would no doubt have been p'&gt;ssible to bring the offending tribe to terms, but the opportunity would have been lost of enabling Syud Toorkee to recover ground, and the hostility towards him would have continued and perhaps increased. “ By spirited co-o{&gt;eration with us, and particularly by employing his brother Abdool Azeez as his General and representative, Syud Toorkee’s position is undoubtedly improved. It is no little advantage that the Arabs should perceive that His Highness has, in his brother, an energetic and bold leader of his troops. It was furthermore consistent with the dignity of the Sultan that his representative should conduct the negotiations. u Considered as a whole, the arrangement concluded with, the Yal Saad with my assent, and approved by His Highness Syud Toorkee, stands as follows : — “ The Y al Saad having agreed to return to allegiance to the Sultan and to pay a certain snm in indemnity to British subjects, and also to refrain from joining Ibrahim bin Ghais in future are received back as subjects of the Sultan. “ In consideration of their submission the Sultan relieves the Y^al Saad from a portion of the indemnity payment by taking it on himself. “ The Y^al Saad Chiefs have executed a bond which is guaranteed by the Chiefs of certain other tribes, engaging to pay to Syud Abdool Azeez the sum of ten thousand dollars in seventv days from 22nd July 1874. “ Syud Abdool Azeez, as the Sultan's representative in the matter, undertakes to recover the above amount in accordance with the bond within three months. The full amount of British claims, that is the sum of 15,000 dollars, to lie then paid by the Sultan. &lt;&lt; Other minor terms were arranged between Abdool Azeez and the Yal Saad, but they are matters purely between the Sultan and his subjects. «It would of course have been more satisfactory to have obtained immediate payment of these claims, but after careful consideration I was convinced that this could only be effected by resort to actual hostilities, which would under the circumstances have been scarcely warrant ed by my instructions, and would also in my own judgment have b. en impolitic. I trust, therefore, that the arrangement effected may on the whole meet with the approval of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council.”285. The Government of India approved of the proceedings of Colonel Ross Proceedings, Political a., August and jVIajor Aides, and rec|uested that their acknow- 1874, No. 2&lt;)5. ledgments might be conveyed to the Senior Naval Officer, Captain Garforth, of Her Majesty’s Ship Philomel, to the Commanders of Her Majesty’s Steam-ships Nimble and Magpie, and to Captain Guthrie, Com manding the May Frere, for their co-operation in the settlement of these affairs. The whole of the proceedings were reported for the information of the Secre tary of State. *z86. The people of Mesnaah and Soweik soon returned to their former peaceful occupations. The Walee of the latter place, Ali bin Salim, was deposed, and Seif bin Hamood, Sheikh of the Hina wee tribe of Beni Ruweyeh, was ap pointed to succeed him, and the Sultan made arrangements for garrisoning Mesnaah with some of the Heddadebeh tribe (also Hinawees) from Fanjah. 287. Movements of Ibrahim bin Ghais. Reconciliation Major Miles’ No. 348 - 113 , dated 5th with Syild Toorkee. —Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais August 1874. was at El Hazam at the time of the departure of Maj or Miles from Mesnaah after the settlement of affairs there. He shortlv afterwards proceeded to Rostak, and succeeded with the aid of the El-Ibrahim (? El-lbri-im) in possessing himself of the districts of Awabi and of the Wadi „ . 4 ,, . , T Beni Khuroos, and it was said that he was build- ing a tort at Awabi with the object ot strengthening himself and ensuring^his retention of the country. The Sheikh of the Yal-bu- Rasheyd tribe (Hinawees) arrived at Muscat on the 11th August with the view of arranging with the Sultan several matters connected with the Batinah, and he informed Major Miles that he was willing to offer himself as a mediator between H is Highness and 1 brahim bin Ghais. He also stated that the Metowwa Moham med bin Sulleym el-Gharibee (who had himself drawn up the agreement) was making great efforts to collect the amount of the indemnity due by the Yal Saad to the British, and that there was every probability of the money being paid by the appointed time. Major Miles also reported that a disposition was shown by I brahim bin Ghais to withdraw from further opposition to Syud Toorkee, and to come to an amicable arrangement. Seif bin Hamood, the newly appointed Wullee of Sovveik, at the wish of Ibrahim bin Ghais, proceeded to Rostak, and had a meet ing with Ibrahim on the subject, with satisfactory results. It was understood by Major Miles that Ibrahim had unconditionally submitted to the Sultan, and was ready to accept whatever allowance His Highness might be pleased to settle on him. This allowance was fixed atone hundred dollars monthly, and it was also agreed that the sum of two thousand dollars, due to Syud Toorkee from Syud Hamid bin n El-Imam, being the unpaid balance of a fine of seven thousand dollars, imposed some ten months pre viously on Syud Hamid for engaging in a treasonable correspondence, should be Political A.. March 1875 , No. 507 . A Wr j tten *W'»ent to this effect Was shortly afterwards received from Ibrahim bin Ghais, and the allowance payable to him commenced to run. o 288.. Payment of the indemnity by the Yal Saad.— To return to the question of the indemnity payable by the Yal Saad. On the 3rd October Major Miles reported that Syud Abdool Azeez had informed him that the Yal Saad had succeeded in collecting the amount due by them, and that some of the tribe were shortly expected in Muscat with the money. The Envoy, p .... „ , 1Q „ XT Seif bin Hamad, arrived on the 4th October, but only brought with him the sum of $ 3,133, and a message from the tribe that they had only been able to collect so much, and that they requested time in which to pay the balance. Both Syud Toorkee and Syud Abdool Azeez considered this as merely a ruse to gain time, and expressed their^confidence that the tribe had collected more than the full amount of the indemnity. As Major Miles felt that it would be extremely inexpedient to enter- 6566 tain the request for an extension of the time allowed for payment, he deemed it best, after conferring with Syud Abdool Azeez, to request the Sultan to despatch that prince to the Batinah in order to use his influence with the sureties to induce the Yal Saad to fulfil their obligations. Syud Abdool Azeez accordingly left Muscat for Burka upon this mission on the 8th October. 289. Abdool Azeez was successful in effecting an arrangement with the Yal Saad, by which they engaged to pay up the balance of the amount due by them by the 15th Ramzan, corresponding with the 26th October 1874, and surrendered six hostages as security for the due peifoimance of then piomise. In the meantime Abdool Azeez was to remain at Burka with the hostages until the full amount should be paid in. 290. On the 2nd November, however, Abdool Azeez returned to Muscat with about one hundred of the Yal Saad tribe, and Political A., March 1875, No. 516. the gum of | 7 &gt;00 o, which had been paid by them, leaving the sum of $ 3,000 to be still recovered. The Yal Saad endeavoured to induce the Sultan to relieve them of this payment, either by taking it upon himself or by soliciting Grovernment to forego the rest of their claim, but this His Highness positively refused to do, and he insisted, moreover, on the balance being produced without further delay. 291. On the 20th November Major Miles reported that only $1,400 remained unpaid. Hie Sultan had however in- Poiiticai a., March 1875, Nos. 519-520. carcerated some 0 f t h e Sheiks in Fort Merani for not having fulfilled their promise, and he informed the Political Agent that he intended to keep them there until the full amount was paid up. I he Government of India, in reporting these proceedings to the Secretary of State, were of opinion that the affair had been managed successfully by the Sultan under the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Muscat. The Secretary of State concurred with the Government of India in this opinion. The affair was finally settled by the Yal Saad paying the whole of the indemnity of ten thousand dollars with the exception of $400. Syud Toorkee represented that they were really unable to make up this small sum, and on the 28th January 1875, the Government of India authorized the Resident in the Persian Gulf to instruct Major Miles to terminate the matter by accepting the amount already paid in quittance of British demands upon the Yal Saad, and dividing it amongst the traders who had suffered at Mesnaah. On the 27th November the Political Agent reported that in communication with Syud Toorkee, who considered that the Batinah had reverted to his authority, he had permitted British Indian traders to return and resume their usual occupations at Mesnaah. On the 2nd April 1875 Major Miles reported that the indemnity of $9,600 „ Vi . . . . , 0 „_ XT received from the Yal Saad had been duly and rateably distributed to the sufferers in the following manner :— Political A., May 1875, No. 305. 292. Political A., March 1875, Nos. 522- 525, 530. No Names of traders. Registere claims. Share from indemnity.

The registered claims amounted to $12,717, and Major Miles brought to notice that Syud Toorkee had taken on liimself the payment of one-third of the indemnity ($5,000). In consideration, however, of the cordial co operation and assistance rendered by the Sultan’s brother, Abdool Azeez, in negotiating and dealing with the Yal Saad tribe, and the great expense incurred by His Highness throughout the affair, the Political Agent suggested that the demand for this portion of the indemnity should be waived altogether. This proposal was supported by the Resident at Bushire. In reply, the Political Agent was informed that His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council was of opinion that His Highness Syud Toorkee should be requested to fulfil his engagement to such extent as might be necessary to give fair compensation for the losses actually sustained. As the registered claims of the traders amounted to $12,717, of which they had received only $9,572, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles was informed that the balance of $5,000 due from His Highness should be reduced to the amount which would suffice for payment after careful investigation into the claims which had been registered and still remained unsatisfied. SECTION II. 293. Expedition of Syud Toorkee against the Beni Riyam.— Proceedings, Political a., July 1874, Towards the end of July the Political Resident Nos. 312 - 313 . in the Gulf obtained the sanction of the Government of India to the advance of six months’ subsidy to the Sultan of Muscat, on the ground that he had assisted our operations on the Batinah, by fitting out an expedition at some expense.** The object of this advance was soon apparent, for on the 24th August the Resident telegraphed that Syud Toorkee was about to Proceedings, Political a., August proceed on the following day against the Beni 18 74, n°. 272 . Riyam, and that he would be joined by the itus, puiagrap i “/O. Hinawees at Semail. Major Miles had, on the 19th Septembe-r 1873, reported that the Beni Riyam were desirous of obtaining possession of certain property belonging, or said to belong to them, in Nezwa and Birket-el Mowz ; that they expected to gain both wealth and influence bv a Colonel Ross’ memorandum on the rising, and would probably create a disturbance 2 ma 1 n * , Folitical A *’ Se P teul - before long. The Beni Riyam, according to Colonel ' Ross, inhabit the district of Jebel-el-Akhdar, and are one of the most important of the Ghafiree tribes, numbering 2,000 fighting men. Jebel-el-Akhdar, or the Green Mountain, is a range of hills situated between Rostak and Nezwa, in the heart of Oman, and is evidently well adapted to be the stronghold of a race of hardy mountaineers. 294. Previously to the departure of Syud Toorkee on the expedition, the province of Oman had been in a very disturbed state. Dissensions and hostilities had broken out between the Hinawee tribes of Nezwa and Ziki and the Ghafiree Beni Riyam regarding the fort of Birket-el-Mowz; one serious collision Major Miles’No. 348-143, dated 5 th had occurred in which about thirty of the Beni August 18/4. Riyam had been killed, and that tribe had been dispossessed of the Birket-el-Mowz. The Sultan of Muscat had espoused the cause of the Hinawees in the quarrel and had not only substantially aided them with men and money, but had despatched a brass field gun with ten gunners to Ziki (where the Hinawees were masters of the situation) to assist them in reducing the fortresses held by their opponents. 295. \ arious attempts were made to reconcile the two contending parties, Proceedings, Political a., November both by independent persons, and by the Sultan’s 1874, No. 34. representative, but all without effect; the reason of the failure being that the Ghafiree tribe of Beni Riyam insisted on the 67 • «restoration of the forts that had been wrested from them, while the Hinawees stoutly refused to render up what they had succeeded in gaining possession ot by force of arms. 296. Such being the position of affairs, His Highness Syud Toorkee deemed it expedient to proceed to the scene of hostilities in person, and bring the war to a conclusion before it reached more serious dimensions. But, as he had become seriously embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs, he solicited an advance of $10,000 from Government for his expenses before undertaking his contem plated enterprise, and his request was granted by Major Miles, on the following grounds :— “The urgency of the matter appeared to me to warrant a compliance with His Highness’ request, as I considered that the unusual energy displayed by His Highness would, with a successful issue of the campaign, tend very greatly to strengthen his position, tranquillize the country, and prevent the constant recurrence of the insurrections and disturbances to which it has been subject so long. I therefore informed Syud Abdool Azeez that Government having been pleased to sanction an advance to Syud Toorkee if found necessary, 1 was ready to meet His Highness’ wishes. His Highness has accordingly since drawn upon me for Rupees 21,600, which 1 have honored and paid.” 297. Syud Toorkee left Muscat on the morning of the 28th August, accompanied by a force of about 400 men. He left his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, in charge of Muscat during his absence. Major Miles reported that the Sultan was becoming on much better terms with Abdool Azeez, and that a very cordial understanding existed between them. The conduct of Abdool Azeez since he had been at Muscat had been very straightforward and sincere and the Sultan felt that he could place much confidence in him. The garrison left at Muscat consisted of about two hundred Wahabees and some of the Beni Bu Hassan tribe of Jaalan. 298. The expedition was of short duration, for on the Sultan proceeding XT , _ beyond Semail, the Ghahree tribes gave in their sub- Pohtical A., November 1874, No. 40. . i o i m i ^ i ° , mission and Syud 1 oorkee returned to Semail to make the final arrangements and. to dismiss the Hinawee tribes collected for the . campaign. 299. The terms on which peace was concluded were as follows :— 1. That the old bazar under the fort at Ziki, formerly occupied by the Beni Biyam, and lately abandoned by them for a new bazar at some distance, should be re-occupied and the new one destroyed. 2. That the annual date-tax due by the Ghafirees should be paid as usual. 3. That Salim bin Nasir, Chief of Harat-el-Baha, who was imprisoned by the sons of Seif-bin-Suleiman, the Sheikh of the Beni Riyam, should be released and his property restored. 4. That Beit-el-Jameh in Nezwa captured by the Hinawees should not be restored, but should remain in possession of the Sultan. 5. That Beit-el-Salut should continue to remain with the Ghafirees. 300. The last condition was the only one in favour of the Ghafirees, and they were compelled to yield the chief point stipulated for by them when endeavours were made to mediate between the belligerent parties, namely, the restitution of the forts captured from them by the Hinawees. Few well-informed persons, however, believed that they would continue to observe and act up to the terms of the engagement longer than it suited their convenience to do so, and it was anticipated that they would watch for an early opportunity to recommence hostilities. 301. A salute of 21 guns was fired at Muscat on the 10th September by Syud Abdool Azeez in honor of the successful peace concluded by the Sultan who returned -to Muscat on the 12th of that month. 302. Syud Toorkee expressed himself as satisfied with the result of the Political a., March 1875 , No. 607. expedition, and said that the Sheikhs of the Al- Wahibeh and other tribes had mediated in the 6809 i '2 If ^ 1 affair and brought the Beni Riyam to terms. The latter were tired of the struggle, having expended most of their resources, and His Highness did not think they would attempt to renew the conflict for a considerable time. *• •&lt; 303. Further dissensions between the Hinawee and Gha- firee tribes. —The.truce that had been arranged between the contending r,.... , . xt parties, the Nizar or Ghafiree Arabs, and the Political A., March 1875, No. 516. t-r J , i • i , i i Yemen or Hina wees, was wantonly violated by a treacherous act on the part of one of the latter at the beginning of November. The brother of one of the Beni Ruweyeh tribe (Hinawees) who was slain at Ziki during the recent disturbances there, murdered a Ghafiree of the town, named Salim bin Nasir, in revenge for his brother’s death; the murderer Khalid being himself severely wounded by his victim during the commission of the deed. This according to Arab ideas constituted an unpardonable breach of honor, and the matter soon became further complicated by the Ghafirees murdering one of the Beni Ruweyeh. Major Miles stated that although he was not exactly informed as to what course the Sultan intended to adopt in this affair, it was probable he would endeavour to hold himself aloof, and the „ ^ v XT riH Political Aorent was directed by the Government of India to encourage His Highness in this intention. 304. On the 25th December Major Miles reported that a serious conflict „ . , „ , XT had occurred in El-Dhahireh between the Hinawees and Ghafirees, in which the latter were worsted. The aggressors were the Beni Ghafir, united with several smaller tribes and numbering, it was said, about two thousand. They attacked the Hinawee tribe of Beni Ali at Yenkul, but were ignominiously defeated and .were compelled to retreat with a loss of about ninety men ; the Beni Ali, who were numerically very inferior, losing only thirteen. Syud Bedr bin Seif, the Governor of Sohar, had been solicited to proceed to El-Dhahireh for the purpose of mediating between the belligerents, and the Sultan had instructed him to endeavour to arrange peace if possible. 305. On the 29th January 1875 it was further reported that open hosti- Poiiticai a., March 1875, Nos. lities had broken out between the various Hinawee 527-529. and Ghafiree tribes, who divide the Semail valley between them. A few days previously a party of Hinawees, urged on by the Beni Ruweyeh, fired into the house of the Walee of Semail, Syud Hamad bin Saeed, killing three persons, one of whom was a Hinawee woman. The Gha firees retaliated by cutting down the Hinawees’ date trees, and as this only served to embitter the quarrel, both parties began to collect their forces, and it was said that about a thousand of the Beni Ruweyeh, were on the move to attack the Ghafirees. The Beni Ruweyeh according to Colonel Ross, are one of the largest of the Hinawee tribes, numbering 2,500 fighting men. 306. The Walee of Semail, not being able to take action himself, repaired at once to Muscat, and reported the affair personally to Syud Toorkee, who directed him, in conjunction with Syud Hamad bin Hamad, Walee of Burka, and Syud Nasir, Walee of Soor, to proceed to Semail to mediate between the belligerents and endeavour to effect an amicable arrangement of the quarrel. Major Miles stated, however, that though it was possible they might succeed in securing a short truce, it was considered very improbable by well-informed persons that either party would consent to settle the feud without recourse to arms, and a serious conflict might therefore be expected between them. The Ghafirees of El-Dhahireh (paragraph 304) were also collecting -their forces to renew the conflict and were said to be meditating an attack on Dhunk, a large town on the road between Bereymi and Ibri. 307. In this unsettled state of things the following telegram was received from Colonel Ross, under date the 23rd February 1875 : — “Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs from Jask, 22nd, as follows:— f Have come across to communicate. Toorkee solicits three months’ advance subsidy arrange Semail difficultywhich he greatly dreads. Has unsuccessfully endeavoured raise loan. Consider position growing weaker and more precarious; he is now entirely in Mesh's hands, and advance if made would probably be muddled away by him unless some assurance taken of its devotion to intended object. It is important though to avert hostilities, and as this cannot be done without funds, 1 beg to support it. I have suggested to Toorkee to employ Azeez in settlement of this affair. Toorkee has offered to Azeez to abdicate in his favor; but Azeez declined. Azeez now interferes and gives counsel as seldom as possible as also Mahomed Azzan. I think time has come to advice Toorkee to raise Azeez's position and associate him more equally in Govern ment, as his influence is rapidly extending and he is now Toorkee's best supporter. He has behaved hitherto with prudence and loyalty, and his co-administration with Toorkee is not only almost necessary to latter, but would probably ensure his own accession on Toorkee's death. I submit this proposal for consideration, but am not sure how it would be received by Toorkee and Azeez.' Message ends. Following is second message from Major Miles, dated 23rd :— ‘ I understand Toorkee purposes arrange matter amicably, mediation if possible, this of course would be expensive, as it would involve payments both parties. Toorkee dreads lest war between Hinawees and Ghafirees become general. If Semail affair not settled, rival factions might then take advantage of opportunity.' Second message ends. I respectfully suggest Major Miles being authorized to advance the money to Sultan provided satisfactory assurances are given as to its proper disposal. I think it would be well to take the opportunity to make a strong representation to His Highness on the subject of his advisers. I solicit as early a reply as possible by telegraph, as detention of Nimble at Telegraph Station would interfere with reliefs.” 308. The Government of India communicated the following instructions by telegraph :— a \ our telegram of twenty-third. You are authorized to give Toorkee advance of three months' subsidy without conditions and with expression of our best wishes. Advice and help may be given if requested on any particular matter, but Government of India is averse from interference in internal affairs of Oman, and advice should not be volunteered.” 309. On the Gth February Major Miles reported the return of the three Major Miles’ No. 62-32, dated 6th officers to Muscat, and stated that they had failed Kbruarj i8/5. effect .any satisfactory settlement of the dispute, and had with difficulty succeeded in inducing the parties to accede to a two months suspension of hostilities to give time for further negotiations. Major Miles distrusted any peaceable termination of the contest for the following reasons: because it arose in a breach of Arab faith and honor on the part of the Beni Ruweyeh, and 2nc£, because the loss sustained by the Hinawees in t^eir date trees cut down by the Ghafirees in Wady Semail amounted to at least fifty or sixty thousand dollars,—a most serious injury, and one through which the seeds had been sown of a prolonged and bitter feud. Major Miles proceeds :— “ Were the damage less considerable, it is poBsible the breach might have been healed by the Sultan simply ordering the Hinawees to pay blood-money for those slain by them, and the Ghahrees to indemnify the sufferers for the loss of their property, but the injury inflicted by the Ghahrees is so much beyond what they will ever be able or willino 1 to repay that a recourse to arms seems inevitable. * It must be obvious that the causes of these quarrels must be attributable in a oreat measure to the weak policy and want of foresight of His Highness Syud Toorkee in dealing with his people. On the conclusion of His Highness' expedition against the Beni Riyam in keptember l s '74, the conditions imposed on that tribe were not wholly carried out as reported &gt;y me at the time, and no attempt has since been made by His Highness to enforce them. Again, when the outrage was first committed by the Beni Ruweyeh the feud might have been ciecvei anil the affair probably arranged by judicious mediation, but His Highness di t not interpose 1 he tribes were left to settle their own differences and the power to control them has now left his hands. Ti- ] l )art y are sdll striving to foment discord, and it is rumoured that the A nu 7 eh ar ® P re P ari ng to join the Beni Ruweyeh and other Hinawees of i ,• u ‘Ghahrees. Nearly the whole principality indeed is now astir, and from the c-'enng ig i my imperfect information gives me, a contest seems likely to ensue that will distract the country from one end to the other.” e 3 ^i 0 ' 4 -u acknowledging the receipt of this information, ! e elrec , le chtical Agent to the orders of the Government (paragraph 304) o encouiage His Highness the Sultan to avoid'taking part in the feud. 311. On the 19th February Major Miles reported that the truce between February^ 875 .* N ° 87 ^’ dated 19th ttie hostile Hinawees and Ghafirees in the Semail nrmnrrp/l + , Strict was still valid, that no hostilities had occuried, and that when an attempt had been made bv some of the Hinawees 7071 T to break the truce by firing into the Ghafirees’ territory, the leaders of both parties interfered and came to an understanding that the truce should be respected for the full period. Major Miles added :— “ His Highness Syud Toorkee is in considerable anxiety at the prospect of the approaching contest, and would be willing to avert the chance of it by any means in his power. He is apprehensive lest the Hinawees, should they prove triumphant over the Ghafirees, take advantage of the occasion to possess themselves of Muscat, and hold the disposal of the Sultanate or Imamate in their hands.” Major Miles also forwarded a copy of a letter from Syud Toorkee, soliciting payment of the next half-yearly subsidy in advance. This was sanctioned by the Government of India. 312. Major Miles reported on the Gth March that the Ghafirees had Major Miles’ No. 114-54, dated Gth responded favourably to the Sultan’s offer of media- March 1875. tJcm in the Semail affair, and that some of the leaders had already arrived at Muscat for the purpose of conferring with His Highness. The arrival of the Hinawees was expected shortly. The great difficulty lay in satisfying the demands of the Hinawees for compensation for the' loss of their date trees, but the Sultan stated that if he were to overcome this difficulty, he would endeavour to extend the truce for one year. 313. A week later, however, no progress had been made in the arbitration Major Miles’ No. 121-58, dated 13th of this affair, though the leaders of both the March 1875. parties were present in Muscat, and the Hinawee tribes supporting the Sultan, such as the Al-Wahibeh, Bu Hassan, &amp;c., had intimated to him that they would be compelled to join the other Hinawees in the conflict if some amicable settlement were not arrived at. i t was then proposed to refer the matter to the decision of the Kazees, and a few of each party were deputed to the Batinah to request Mohammed bin Suleyyim el Gharibee to undertake the duty of an arbitrator. 314. On the 3rd Ajiril, however, the Political Agent reported that this attempt to adjust the difficulty had failed, as El- Gharibee had declined to proceed to Semail and undertake the matter, on the ground, it was believed, that he had no guarantee or assurance from the parties that his decision would be respected or acted on. He offered to come into Muscat and give his decision if specially requested to do so by the Sultan, and provided His Highness would assemble the leaders of the parties there, but this proposal apparently failed to meet with Syud Toorkee’s approval. Major Miles stated that, although the two months’ truce had expired, and no hostilities had yet occurred, the general impression was that a recourse to arms Was inevitable, unless the Sultan proceeded in person to Semail. Political A., May 1875, Nos. 333-338. 315. The Hinawee tribes, El-Hijrieen and Boo Hassan of Jaalan, who had been retained by Syud Toorkee for the protection of Muscat since the dis missal of the Wahabees (see paragraph 380), intimated their intention not to take part in the coming struggle, as they had been threatened by the Beni boo Ali that if they joined their fellow tribesmen in Oman, the Beni boo Ali would regard it as a casus belli and attack them in Jaalan. The only reason for hoping that hostilities would be postponed lay in the fact that if the Hinawees cut off the water-supply, the Ghafirees who occupied the lower part of the valley of Semail would be irretrievably ruined, as their date-crops would be destroyed. They would therefore do all in their power to avert an immediate rupture. 316. In the beginning of April some of the El-Hijrieen and Boo Hassan went to Semail from Mftscat to make a final endeavour to close the breach between the parties, with the result that a further suspension of hostilities was agreed on for two months. No final adjustment of the quarrel was made, but hopes were entertained that through the intervention of Syud Hill.-d, who was the owner of extensive date-groves in the district, and whose interests would materially suffer in the event of a conflict between the tribes, an amicable ter mination of the affair might be brought about. As the basis of a settlement, the Hinawees had offered to make peace and forego all other claims if some property,which formerly belonged to the Metowwn. El-X\hahlee, and which had heen injuied by the Ghafirees to the value of about $8,000, were made good, and in view of this Syud Hillal had proposed to purchase the property under certain conditions. * Lieutennnt'CoioneiMiiee,No. 230 - 85 , On the 28th May Lieutenant-Colonel Miles re- dated 28 th May 1875, received with ported' that the negotiations for an amicable adjust- Si %7 rnent of the Setnail difficulty had totally failed, and 1875. that hostilities had broken out throughout the district. In the first conflict the Hinawees suffered a severe defeat, twenty-two being killed and a large number wounded, but their forces were gathering and they were preparing for a severe struggle with the Ghaffirees. In the following ^ ,Z ■, . i&gt; • month (June 10th) Lieutenant-Colonel Miles was t From Political Resident, Persian i,i i •,± / n 11 Gulf, No. 650-168, dated 25 th June enabled to subnutt a more favorable report to the 1875 - effect that actual hostilities had not been renewed in the Semail District and that no further bloodshed had occurred there. A short truce of ten days had again been agreed to by both parties during which it was hoped some efforts for promoting a reconciliation would be made. On it From Political Resident, Persian the 24til of the month fJune) Lieiltenailt-Colonel Gulf, No. 681 - 171 , dated 1st July 1871. Miles commuiiicated + the satisfactory intelligence that the Semail difficulty had at length been satisfactorily, and it was hoped, finally adjusted, and that no further disturbances in that quarter were to be apprehended for the present at all evnts. In addition to the actual injuries inflicted on each other both parties were suffering greatly by remaining so long in an offensive attitude which prevented them from attending to their crops and date trees. Both sides had recently been reinforced by large numbers, and a serious conflict being imminent between them, they both became anxious to make peace at any sacrifice. Therefore on the mediation of the El Yaakib, a Ghaffiree tribe of Ibria, peace was concluded on the understanding that all matters in dispute should rest as they were, each side withdrawing all claims against the other. The Hinawees declared to having lost forty men slain in the various encounters, and the Ghaffirees said they had lost three men ; no blood- money, however, was to be paid by either side. “ It will be seen” wrote Lieu tenant-Colonel Miles:— “ That the Hinawees have had decidedly the worst of the affair all through and have suffered most, both in men and property. The terms of peace therefore cannot he equally acceptable to both sides, and it will probably be observed only so long as suits the convenience of the Hinawees.” SECTION III. 317. Allowance to Syud Abdool Azeez during his resi- Political A., September 1874, Nos. dence at Muscat. —The circumstances attend- 364 * 371 * ing the return of Syud Abdool Azeez to Muscat and his reconciliation with his brother, Syud Toorkee, will be found related in paragraph 277 of this Precis. 318. It appeared that no arrangement was then made with respect to the allowance Syud Abdool Azeez was to receive at Muscat, and on the 26th June 1874 the Political Agent reported that it had corne to his knowledge that the Syud was in embarrassed circumstances, and that he was unable to provide for his own expenses. Acting on the advice of Major Miles, Syud Abdool Azeez represented his circumstances, to the Sultan, who referred the matter to the Political Agent. Major Miles informed him that he regarded the question as one solely for His Highness’ consideration. 319. Syud Toorkee subsequently proposed that the allowance should be paid through the British Government, but under instructions from the Resident in the Gulf, Major Miles informed him that the matter was not one in wffiich the Government could intervene. 320. His Highness then arranged to pay Syud Abdool Azeez the sum of five hundred dollars monthly, commencing from the 10th May 1874, after a 72f refund of six hundred dollars, which was in deposit in the Muscat Treasury on account of the allowance of Syud Abdool Azeez while he was residing in British territory, had been made to him. These arrangements met with the approval of the Government of India. 4 V' 321. Disagreements between Synd Toorkee and his nephews, Syuds Mohammed and Hamad. —Major Miles reported, on the 27th August 1374, that a difference had arisen between Syud Toorkee and Political a., September 1874, Nos. his nephews, Syud Mohammed and Hamad, the 347-340. sons of the late Sultan of Muscat, Syud Thoweynee bin Saeed. The cause of this was attributed to family matters connected with Syud Toorkee’s daughter, who was married to her cousin, Hamad, in November 1873, but had subsequently been divorced. Since then the two Syuds have received the Sultan’s permission to proceed to Bombay, but had not availed themselves of it. 322. On the evening of the 21st August Major Miles was surprised by a visit from the Syuds and their two sisters (one of whom was the widow of the late Minister, Thoweynee bin Mohammed), who said they had come to claim refuge and protection, as they had just been sent for by the Sultan, and had learnt privately that it was His Highness’ intention to imprison them in fetters in the fort to prevent them from leaving Muscat. Major Miles found it impossible to refuse them an asylum, but immediately communicated with Syud Toorkee, and requested him to send down influential persons to reassure his nephews. 323. Syud Toorkee sent over Syud Mohammed Azzan, the Governor of Muscat, without delay, who gave them repeated assurances that they had nothing to fear; but as they were still unwilling to go, Major Miles promised them his protection and a guarantee of safety, and they then returned home with their sisters. 324. Syud Toorkee was averse to their leaving Muscat, as he feared they might be induced by evil-disposed persons to intrigue and form a coalition against him, and His Highness endeavoured to secure the mediation of the British Agent with the view of their remaining at Muscat. The. difficulty lay in Syud Toorkee having already given them permission to depart, but it was stated that this had been granted hastily and without due consideration. 325. Major Miles therefore took an opportunity of advising the youths strongly against quitting their uncle’s protection, and made them understand that they must not expect any support from Government while in India, and that should they return to Oman from Bombay to foster rebellion against Syud Toorkee they would incur the displeasure of Government. 32G. The two Syuds adopted the advice of Major Miles, and at the request of Syud Toorkee they gave up their intention of proceeding to India. The proceedings of Major Miles in adjusting these family differences were approved by the Government of India. | *1 327. Proceedings of Syud Salim bin Thoweynee.— On the 17th September 1874 Major Miles reported that Syud Abdool Azeez bin „ t Thowevnee, the brother of Syud Salim, and a man Political A., March 187o, No. 507. iVw u i.- tvt t jij • named Dahoo bin Mohammed had arrived at Muscat from Gwadur in company with Deen Mohammed, the Chief of Dashtyar, who had been induced to bring them in, Major Miles believed, on a promise of recompense. Syud Abdool Azeez had been immured in the palace, and it was not expected he would be further harmed, but there was good reason to believe that Dahoo had been executed by the Sultan. 328. Major Miles further reported on the 3rd October that the mother of Syud Salim had arrived at Muscat on her way to Kishm from Zanzibar. She had embarked on Political A., March 1875, No. 509.board a bugla belonging to Syud Burghash, which had foundered at sea near Socotra and gone down with seventy-five souls on board. About thirty persons, including the lady mentioned above, had crowded into a boat and reached the island, whence they were brought on by a coasting vessel. Political a., March 1875 , Nos. 539 - 329. On the 18th January 1875 the Kesident 5i8 ' • at Bushire telegraphed to the following eftect:— “ Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs that Syud Toorkee fears his nephew, Salim, will try to cross either to Pirate Coast or Soor, having been invited by Gbaliree tribes of Jaalan. Salim is residing on Kishm island in Persian territory. Would Government wish any endeavours made to prevent Salim crossing to Oman or to arrest him if found at sea.” In reply, Colonel Boss was referred to the previous correspondence which * Paragraph 255 of Prods. hacl P'Jf ed « n subject of Syud Salim, 4 ' and especially to the orders of the Government of India, dated the 5th November 1873, that if Syud Salim “ comes into Gwadur or Kurrachee and gives himself up unconditionally he will be granted the same provision as Abdool Azeez; but that if he does not comply within such time as you [the Commissioner in Sind] may direct, the terms will not be renewed, but he will be made a pri soner wherever found j” 1 and it was stated that these orders were still in force, and that Syud Salim might be made a prisoner whenever it was in the power of the Besident to arrest him. 330. The apprehensions felt by Syud Toorkee in reference to his nephew will be understood from the following letter, which was addressed to the Political Agent, under date the 23rd December 1874 :— “I inform you that by the blessing of the Almighty Oman is at peace and its inhabi tants in security, there being no disturbance of any kind at present. What I have now to represent concerns my nephew, Salim bin Thoweynee. I took pity and compassion on him anti his cucumstances because he had suffered much, and seeing he had no hope except in me I settled a monthly allowance on him sufficient for his support on the understanding that he would give up all his designs and evil intentions and take up his residence at Kishm. &amp; Now in these days I am constantly receiving intelligence that he is intriguing and endeavourino* to cause a lising in Oman, and some of the discontented give him encouragement and hope, but they are false, and they do not cease to maintain a correspondence. I cannot, however, remain silent while he is fomenting disturbances in my dominions, as I fear lest his intri^nes should result in loss and injury to my subjects, and I therefore beg you will do me the favor to write or send a messenger to Sheikh Suggur giving Salim over to his charge and lettino him understand that in the event of any thing being done by Salim you would hold him (Sheikh Suggur) responsible. My reliance for peace and security will then be on the British Govern ment on whom I depend, and the allowance to Syud Salim will be continued to him. If my request be more than you can accede to, I beg you will grant me permission to send and brino- Sahm to Muscat, whereby the anxiety he is causing will be removed and peace of mind secured to me. r lhe information I have is from a trustworthy source, and I am willing to abide by your decision.” ° 331. Colonel Boss informed the Sultan in reply that he was unable to accede to his request to hold Sheikh Suggur of Kishni responsible for Syud Salim s intrigues, and he trusted that His Highness would also see that it would be contrary to the established custom of the British Government to sanction the forcible seizure of Syud Salim when residing in foreign territory. He requested His Highness to acquaint Major Miles as soon as he had reason to apprehend that any hostile movement from Kishm Avas being undertaken by Syud Salim, or that he meditated crossing to Oman. 332. On the 16th January Major Miles telegraphed that Syud Toorkee’s anxiety was increasing, and that he believed Syud Salim would either try to cross to the Pirate Coast, or would come down to Soor, whither he had been invited by the Ghafiree tribes of Jaalan. In a letter of the same date he transmitted a further letter he had received from Syud Toorkee on the subject, which is given * A*75 u referred the matter to Colonel Ross whose decision I shall he bound to accept since the in terests of the British and Arab Governments are one, and Colonel Ross has always interested himself in all that concerns me and will enquire into the matter. I have been expecting 1 a reply for some time. Now we have come to know from a reliable source that the abovementioned people of Oman are visiting him and I fear will gain the mastery over his understanding, and that he will consent to carry out their wishes and enter Oman in the hope of usurping authority which will provoke disturbances.” “ Now it is for you to order. * “ I trust you may see fit to interfere in this matter and prevent his (Syud Salim’s) leaving the island he is residing on until such time as Colonel Ross’ reply is received, or let us proceed thither for this purpose since I fear delay in this matter will end in disaster, as I am cognizant of the duplicity of the people of Oman.” Major Miles added the following remarks :— “On receipt of His Highness’ letter I personally communicated with him, and he informed me that the intrigue to bring Salim again into Oman was commenced by the Beni Boo Ali, El Jerebeh, and other Ghaliree tribes in the south-east, who had invited him thither and promised him support. Salim had at first declined to come, but ultimately he agreed that if his pension were stopped or paid irregularly he would accept the invitation. “ His Highness added that Sheikh Abdoolla bin Salim of the Beni Boo Ali who had recently visited Muscat, had intended to have proceeded to Kishm with the object of bringing Salim thence with him, but had been dissuaded from his purpose in this by Sheikh Majid bin Hamad. “Sheikh Ali bin Khalfan El Jeneybi has also engaged in this intrigue and went to Sohar with the intention of returning to Jaalan overland througk Dhahireh and Oman and inciting the Ghafiree tribes en route to join the coalition. Syud Toorkee, however, having learnt his intentions despatched orders to Sohar to have him sent back. This Ali bin Khalfan a short time previous had offered his services to His Highness to mediate and effect a reconciliation with the Beni Riyam tribe, but Toorkee had declined the offer, and hence it is supposed his resentment and determination to intrigue against him. “ His Highness said that Syud Salim would probably first try and get across to the Shemal Coast, Shargah, or Debaye, and eventually come down to Soor to join his friends in Jaalan. “There is little fear, I think, of Salim being able to oust his uncle, Toorkee, even if he should land in Oman, as he is too well known in the country, but his presence would indubi tably cause unceasing disturbances and uneasiness, and tend greatly to unsettle the country besides causing His Highness increased expenditure in counteracting his operations.” 333. Colonel Ross telegraphed to know whether “ Government would wish any endeavours made to prevent Salim crossing to Oman or to arrest him if found at sea,” and was referred to the previous orders, in which he was informed that Syud Salim might be apprehended wherever it might be in his power to arrest him. He was also informed that “ as regards the Sheikh of Kishm, there was no evidence of the Chief’s complicity in Syud Salim’s intrigues, and moreover it would not be in the power of this Government to interpose even if such complicity were established.” 334. On the 5th February 1875 Syud Toorkee addressed a farther letter « &gt;T to the Political Agent, in which he stated that it had become known to him tor certain that the Omanees were still in correspondence with Syud Salim, and were “inviting him to the country for the purpose of stirring up rebellion.” No action seems to have been taken on this letter, nor have any overt designs of Syud Salim yet been reported. 335. Proposed release of Syud Khaleefa bin Saeed from confinement at Zanzibar. —On the 12th June 1874 the Resident in the „ .... , . T i io^T /4 x- Persian Gulf forwarded a khureeta from the Sultan Political A., July 1874, IS os. 324-326. oi Muscat to the address ot liis JtiXcellency the Viceroy, in which His Highness solicited the aid of the Government of India in obtaining the release from confinement at Zanzibar of his brother, Khaleefa bin Saeed, and intimated that if Syud Burgash did not wish him to remain at Zanzibar, he had no objection to his removal to, and residence at, Muscat.336. The facts connected with Khaleefas imprisonment are briefly as follows :— At the heo-innino- of 1872 during the absence of Syud Burgash, Sultan of Zanzibar, on a pilgrimage to Mecca, Syud Khaleefa Political a., May 1872 , No. lOo. formed the design of seizing on the Government with the assistance of some of the Chiefs of the native soldiery and the Omanee Arabs. This plot was, however, frustrated by the Regent, who intercepted a note in Syud Khaleefas handwriting and under his seal, in which he promised the heads of the Oman mercenaries higher pay and more lucmtive posts if they would join him in overthrowing the Government of Syud Burgash. For this act Syud Khaleefa was arrested and placed in irons by the Regent. On the return of Syud Burgash, His Highness declined to release his brother in con finement and he had remained a prisoner until the date of Syud Toorkee’s khureeta, which was forwarded to the Acting Political Agent at Zanzibar in view of his ascertaining from the Sultan whether he was willing to comply with Syud Toorkee’s wish to procure the release of his brother. 337. Captain Prideaux reported on the 23rd September 1874 that on Political A., November 1874 , Nos. bringing the matter to the notice of Syud Burgash, 283-285. H is Highness told him that some months previ ously he had offered permission to his brother to retire to Muscat^ but that the latter had refused to do so, and insisted on either remaining at Zanzibar, or at one of the coast towns, such *as Lamu or Mombasa. His Highness then asked if the Political Agent would like to see his brother, Khaleefa, and on Captain Prideaux assenting, he ordered the young Syud to be suTnmoned to the palace. 338. The appearance of the young Prince, who was brought in irons to the palace, is described as squalid and miserable to the last degree. Captain Pri deaux found it exceedingly difficult to ascertain what his wishes were. He said that if he went to Muscat, he feared he would be subjected to the same treat ment at the hands of his brothers, Toorkee and Abdool Azeez, as he was then imderffoinff at Zanzibar : and when he was assured that there was no fear of this, so long as he behaved himself with propriety, he said he wished to place himself under British protection. The Political Agent assured him that this was impossible, as the British Government only intervened in the matter out of friendship for the children of Syud Saeed; and the interview then came to an end. 339. A copy of Captain Prideanx’s despatch was forwarded to the Res’dent in the Gulf for communication to Syud Toorkee, whose khureeta was acknowledged by His Excellency the Viceroy. 340. On receipt of this khureeta, Syud Toorkee expressed his thanks and Political a., January 1875, Nos. acknowledgment for the kind mediation of Govern- 124 - i25 - ment in the matter, and observed that he had merely wished to do his brother Khaleefa, whom he had never seen, a kindness in offering him an asylum at Muscat, but that his motives and good intentions had been misunderstood by his brother, and as the latter was unwilling to leave Zanzibar, he had nothing further to say on the subject. 341. On the question being referred by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for the opinion of Dr. Kirk, that officer stated :— Secret, March 1875, Nos. 30-33. “ I am quite sure that we will he more glad than the Sultan of Zanzibar to get rid of Syud Khaleefa, but I think that, under the circumstances, Syud Toorkee of Muscat should be made in some way responsible for the good conduct of his brother if he takes him under his protection. “ There is one thing, however, to be kept in mind, that Syud Khaleefa is without means of support, having squandered his small patrimony in the attempt against Ids brother; and that if he retires to Muscat, we shall in all probability have the Sultan of Muscat urging all manner of claims for money said to be owing to this youth by the Sultan of Zanzibar. “ I think Captain Prideaux has acted judiciously, as reported in his letters, in confining his action to a simple presentation of the request of the Sultan of Muscat, but unless Syud 76 i. &gt;77 Khaleefa is now willing 1 to leave'tho country, and give some pledge that he will not renew his attempt against the Government of Zanzibar, it will be difficult for the Sultan to leave behind him an open enemy and rival at the very time he again proposes quitting his dominions on a visit to Europe. “ It is well known that the Ruler of Muscat is ever ready to intrigue against Zanzibar, just as the Sultan of Zanzibar has too often taken advantage of political difficulties at Muscat; but if there is any one point clear in the line of policy we ought to pursue in dealing with these States, it is this, that the further separated in every way these two kingdoms are, the better it will be for our endeavoiirs in suppressing the slave-trade. “ I am of opinion that if the Indian Government take any active measures in getting Syud Khaleefa liberated and removed to Muscat, they will be to some extent also responsible for the consequences, but I think that Syud Burgash will liberate his younger brother and allow him to go out of the country if he should so desire. I believe also he would even now allow him to live in Zanzibar on a solemn assurance of his not renewing any attempt to usurp the Government. But if this should be during the Sultan’s absence in Europe, I would, as the British Agent practically responsible for the peace, ask that he he placed directly under my authority and liable to arrest, if he made any attempt similar to that which now causes the Sultan to keep him prisoner. Political A., May 1875, No. 297. “I may remark that the condition of Syud Khaleefa derives its only importance from the possibility of his succeeding to the throne in event of the death of the present Sultan.” 342. The Political Agent at Zanzibar, on being made acquainted with the decision of Syud Toorkee in the matter, stated that Syud Burgash assured him that it was not his wish to confine his brother, but that as he declined to go to Muscat and would give no assurance for his peaceable conduct if allowed his freedom in Zanzibar, he was under the painful necessity of keeping him a prisoner ; and Dr. Kirk con curred in thinking that although Syud Khaleefa is wanting in decision of char acter, it would be extremely dangerous to allow him his freedom on the eve of the Sultan’s departure for Europe. As to the treatment of Syud Khaleefa during the absence of Syud Burgash, much must depend upon who the Regent left in charge might be. SECTION IV. 343. Outrages upon Brtish subjects at Hellaneea in the KooriaMooria Islands.— On the 23rd Feb- o i um os - ruary 1874 the Political Resident at Aden reported to the Political Agent at Muscat the circumstances connected with an outrage said to have been committed by some Soorees on Hellaneea, one of the Kooria Moorift Islands, which were ceded to Her Majesty Queen Victoria by the Imam of Muscat on the 14th July 1854. The facts as gathered from a letter addressed by one Ahmed Abdoollah at Macullah to Issac Hossein, an inhabitant of Aden, are as follows :— “ Two buggalows commanded by Nakodas Nathoo Sirjee and Noor Mahomed, supposed to be subjects of the Gaekwar and the 1 Rao of Cutch, left Aden about December last, and touched at Hellaneea. When they were at the latter place a boat belonging to one of the buggalows was lowered, into which both the Nakodas entered, and with some of the men made for the purpose of searching for water. “ Immediately on landing they are said to have been attacked by a body of Soorees, who made five of them prisoners, the remaining men having managed to make their escape with the boat and to rejoin the buggalows. “ After a detention of couple of hours the Soorees offered to restore the prisoners to liberty on receiving a ransom of $ 300. One of the Nakodas, Noor Mahomed, stated that he had the amount on board, whereupon permission was given him to go with one man to fetch the money, whilst the remaining three were still kept in custody. On reaching his vessel in safety, Noor Mahomed feared to return to shore lest all should be killed, and he therefore set sail from that place, taking with him in company the 2 nd buggalow and leaving the three prisoners to their fate. General Schneider added that he had communicated with Admiral Gum ming, desiring him to call at the Kooria Mooria Islands, to see if any of the Indians referred to were known to be at Hellaneea.On receiving the above report, the Political Agertt at Muscat addressed Syud Toorkee on the subject, requesting him to make a strict enquiry into the matter at Soor, and asking for the production of the captives if they had been taken there. His Highness accordingly despatched one Saeed bin Mussalim El- Mawallee to Soor, who confirmed the report regarding the outrage and the cir cumstances connected therewith, as had previously been reported. The attack, it was ascertained, was made by the Jaaferah of El-Askharah, a sub-tribe of the Beni Boo Ali, and it was feared that the men had been murdered or made away with, as there was no trace of them to be discovered at Soor. 344. On the 30th April, Major Miles reported that he had received fur ther information respecting the outrage at Hellaneea, from which it appeared that the three Cutchees were not killed by the El-Jaaferah, but that shortly after the departure of the two Kotias, another Kotia arrived there from Aden, and that the El-Jaaferah having obtained $250 from this vessel, sent the three men on board her. Major Miles added the following particulars :— There were seven boats of the El-Jaaferah engaged in the affair I understand, and the flames of the Nakodas of six of these are given in the margin. His Highness Syud Toorkee informs me that on the return of the boats to El-Askharah and the affair becom ing known, the two Chief Sheikhs of the Beni Boo Ali, viz., Abdoollah bin Salim and Majid bin Hamad, seized the men implicated in the manner and mulcted them in a small sum by way of punishment. Ahmeydi bin Robeya. Salim bin Khulfan bin Mussalim, Naim bin Muftar. Khamis bin Jooma. Mussalim Okb icullud Kbamas. “ The El-Jaaferah are one of the principal sub-tribes of the Beni Boo Ali, and are said to number about one thousand five hundred men. Their head-quarters are at El-Askharah, a town with a small fort about 50 miles south of lias-el-Had, but they also extend a consider able distance along the coast. Their employment is fishing for sharks, seer-fish, &amp;e., which they salt and export in great quantity to Soor, Maculla, and other ports, and they were actually engaged in fishing at Hellaneea when the occurrence took place. The Kooria Mooria Islands are said to be much frequented for this purpose by the coast tribes almost throughout the year. The El-Jaaferah have no trading buggalows, but a number of large fishing boats. EI-Askharah alone owns about 40 of these. “ I have communicated with His Highness the Sultan on the subject of punishing the perpetrators of the outrage, but His Highness does not appear to consider himself in a posi tion to coerce the tribe. Any attempt on his part to do so would probably not only be unavailing, but also result iu irritating the Beni-Boo Ali and estranging them from him. “ The coast tribes appear in general to be peaceful and well conducted on the sea; at least I am unable after enquiry to hear of a similar outrage having occurred before. It is however, I respectfully submit, very important that serious notice should be taken of this affair in order to prevent a recurrence, as, if the tribes find they can attack trading buggalows with impunity, they may be encouraged to continue and increase their depredations The Government of India, in acknowledging receipt of the correspondence, considered that it was important to make the offending tribe understand that such offences on British subjects would not be allowed to pass unnoticed. 345. In a further letter, dated the 11th June, Major Miles stated that he Political a., August 1874, No,. 12 .I 8 . considered the evidence in the case sufficiently com- plete, and that it proved that a piratical outrao'e had been committed by a party of Arabs on British subjects, within British territorv, involving personal injury and a loss of property to the amount of about $35(k He added :— “The guilty parties are well known, and the names of the chief men concerned have been obtained. They are easily accessible to us, and I would respectfully urge the extreme expedi ency of bringing them to account and punishing them for the offence without much delay. Six months have already elapsed since the affair occurred, and if the S. A. Coast Arabs once get possession of the idea that they can commit such attacks with impunity, they may o&gt;i V e considerable trouble before they are checked, and the confidence of the owners of country craft in the security of these seas would be for a time destroyed/’ 346. I he matter was also brought to the notice of the Government of Bombay by the Itao of Cuteh, who asked for compensation for the traders and the removal of the pirates. 34/. Colonel Boss was informed by the Government of India that it would await the result of an interview he proposed to hold with the Sultan on 78 *■ z. ✓79 v the subject, and that in the event of Syud Toorkee deciding to adopt coercive measures against the tribe, His Excellency in Council authorized him to offer to His Highness the aid of the British Government so far as it could be afforded by the Gulf Squadron. 348. On the 30th July the Resident in the Gulf reported that he had Political a., August 1874 ,No 8 . 269 . 271 . the Political Agent at Muscat to address the Chiefs of the Beni Boo Ali tribe to ascertain if they would undertake to obtain redress from the perpetrators of the outrage. This had been done, and an answer had been received from Majid bin Hamad and Abdoolla bin Salim, two of the Sheikhs, to the effect that they would endeavour to punish the perpetrators of the outrage and recover the plundered property, but both Major Miles and Colonel Ross were of opinion that, notwithstanding these professions, no reparation could be exacted from the tribe without actual compul sion, or at least a threat of coercion. Colonel Ross recommended therefore that as soon as the season allowed the Political Agent should proceed with one of Her Majesty s vessels and demand from the El Jaaferah tribe payment of the amount stolen from the Indians, or the surrender of the culprits and their boats; and that if they failed to comply, the fishing boats of the tribe should be seized. 1 he Government of India approved of these measures, and enquired what His Highness the Sultan proposed to do in the matter. 349. The Resident telegraphed on the 12th September that the Political Political a., September 1874, Nos. Agent had proceeded to Askharah in Her Majesty’s 2ol ' 2 ° 2 ’ Philomel and had demanded reparation from the Jaaferah tribe through the Sheikh of the Beni Boo Ali for the outrage. The Arabs being unwilling to yield the offenders to punishment, had submitted to pay a fine of $600, and had promised future good behaviour. These proceed ings were approved of by the Government of India. 350. Ihe details were as follows :—Colonel Ross found on conferring with' Political A.. November 1874, No. 208. the , Sul . tan H j S Highness Was not in a position to obtain redress for the misconduct of the Jaaferah * tribe, his relations with the south-east Ghafiree tribes not being satisfactory. Thinking it therefore unadvisable to press the Sultan on the subject, Colonel Ross instructed Major Miles to take whatever steps were practicable and expe dient in the matter, and the Political Agent after communicating with Syud Abdool Azeez, and ascertaining tint there were no apprehensions of disturbance or other difficulty, determined to proceed in H. M. S. Philomel without delay in order to reach Askharah before the season opened. Major Miles proceeds :— “ Saeed bin Mussalim, the person who had been despatched to Soor by His Highness Syud Toovkee in the first instance to investigate the case, was appointed by Syud Abdool Azeez to accompany me and assist in communicating with the tribe. “ I arrived at Soor on the 1st instant, and was glad to hear that the Jaaferah boats had not yet put to sea, but were expected to do so in a few days. I was informed that when thev depart the rest of the inhabitants of El-Askherah betake themselves to the interior, so that had 1 arrived too late it would have been necessary to postpone operations for another twelve months. “After communicating with the Governor of Soor, Syud Nasir bin Mohamed A1 Bu Saeedee, whom Syud Abdool Azeez had directed to afford me every assistance in his power, I wrote to the Sheikhs of the Beni Boo Ali, Majid and Abdoolla, requesting them, if they were sincere in their protestations of good-will towards the British Government, to meet 'me at El-Askherah and use their influence in inducing the Jaaferah to comply with our just demands. “ Oh reaching El-Askherah the Sheikhs, Abdoolla bin Salim and Eusof bin Ali, came on *board, the other Sheikh Majid having been unable to leave home through illness. None of the El Jaaferah accompanied them, but the Sheikhs said the Jaaferah had left everything in their hands. J ° “ I then informed the Sheikhs of the complaint made by the crews of the two vessels attacked at Hellaneea an .l of my instructions to obtain reparation for the outrage. The Sheikhs in reply said the explanation offered by the Jaaferah was to the effect that when the crews of the two Kotias landed at Hellaneea to get water a disturbance arose among them, and the Arabs seeing this went to interfere and stop the quarrel, but the Kotia men misunder standing their object became frightened, fled to their boats and tried to get away.V “ I told the Sheikhs that the JaaferaVs story was neither plausible nor credible, that the Jaaferah had broken the peace of the seas and wantonly attacked two trading- vessels belonging to Indian protected subjects, and 1 required the restitution of the plundered property and the surrender of the chief individuals who had been concerned in the outrage. The Sheikhs admit ted that the Jaaferah had obtained a considerable plunder at Ilellaneea, and said that the tribe could offer no opposition, but submitted to the demands of Ciovernment, whatever they might be. They requested until the next day, however, to consult with the tribe, which was of course granted. “ On the Sheikhs returning on board the following day, they said that the offenders, six in number, had at first consented to surrender themselves and produce the plunder, but that during the night they had fled from the town and escaped into the interior. Some of the tribe had, however, gone after them and would, it was expected, bring them back. The Sheikhs added that the Jaaferah had never committed themselves before, and that the rest of the tribe greatly regretted the affair, and that they had promised either to deliver up the offenders or the vessels belonging to them for confiscation. “ It is one of the good traits of the Arab that men of the same tribe generally stand by and shield each other in misfortune, and it was evident to me that the escape of the offenders was a concerted affair. Captain Garforth was of opinion that it would be impracticable to tow the boats, as they were unseaworthy at the time from being so long on shore, and that an attempt to do so would cause their destruction. These boats vary from ten to thirty tons and are worth from two hundred to five hundred dollars each, and I resolved not to interfere with them except as a last resource. I therefore informed the Sheikhs that as the offenders were not forthcoming, I imposed a fine on them for the outrage of dollars six hundred, which the Sheikhs at once expressed their readiness to pay. “ I waited another day at El-Askherah, but the Sheikhs were unable to raise the money, as it was found the town could only produce about two hundred or three hundred dollars in cash and jewels, and it was therefore arranged that the Sheikhs and the headmen of the Jaaferah should come in the Philomel to Soor to borrow the money on their own security. The Jaaferah people in return engaging themselves not to proceed to sea this season, or to water their date trees and gardens until the money was repaid. The date groves were also to remain mortgaged to the Sheikhs as a further security. “ I accordingly returned to Soor, where the fine was produced by the Sheikhs, and I then informed them that the matter was at an end, but I pointed out the serious notice Government had taken of the offence, and warned them that a repetition of it would lead to very severe measures being taken. The Jaaferah men said that they were fully convinced of the folly and error of their tribesmen in the matter, and solemnly promised that nothing of the kind should occur again, as they had no desire to get into trouble with the British Government, and the punishment they had received would be remembered by them for a long time. I impressed on the Sheikhs the advisability of recovering the fine from the offenders themselves instead of distributing it over the tribe, as is usually done; the Sheikhs and headmen assured me they fully intended to do so, and would not assist in the least.” 351. The Government of India, after acknowledging the service of Major Political A., November 1874, No. Miles and of Captain Garforth, of H. M. S. 207, and January 1875, No. 92A. Philomel, directed that after making a rateable pay ment out of the fine in satisfaction of a claim for compensation advanced by the Joonaglmr State on behalf of certain of its subjects who had sustained losses by the outrage, the balance should be handed over to Syud Toorkee. 352. On the 13th November 1874 Major Miles reported that he had Political A., May 1875, No ue. addressed the Political Agent in Kattiawar on the subject of the claims tor compensation submitted by the subjects of the Joonaghur State, and had remitted the sum of .Rupees 630-12-9 in satisfaction of the claim; and on the 6th March 1875 he stated that having received a letter from the Political Agent in Kattiawar to the effect that there were no further outstanding claims, the balance of the fine, amounting to $309-97 cents., had been paid over to His Highness the Sultan in accordance with the instructions of Governmetit. 353. • The Secretary of State was of opinion that the Government of Political A., January 1875, No. 126. India “ rightly decided not to add to the embarrassments of the Sultan of Muscat by insisting on Ids active co-operation with the Political Agent in the measures which were adopted against the offending tribe,” and he concurred with the Government of India in thinking the enforcement of a fine of $600, and the promise of future good behaviour which was obtained from the Arabs, to be a satisfactory settlement of the affair. 80 4 i- *81 354. Levy of Customs and Transhipment duties at Mus cat. —In July 1871 an application was made by Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. of Bushire, through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that the tran shipment duties then in force jat Muscat should itcvcnuc, June 18/3, No. 3. ^ removed. These duties were levied in con formity with an arrangement concluded between Colonel Pelly and the Sultan of Muscat in September 1807, to the effect that all cargo by the British India Steam Navigation Steamers transhipped or landed for transhipment should be subject to an ad valorem duty of 10 annas per cent., or that seven-eighths of the duty (5 per cent.) should be returned in the event of any shipment being made after the cargo had been landed. 355. The increase of competition having reduced freights to the lowest profitable point, the London correspondents of Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. wrote that unless the duty was entirely dispensed with, the idea of^ making Muscat a transhipment port must be abandoned. 35G. The Political Agent, on sounding the Sultan on the subject, found the feeling of the Government of Muscat was 'not in favour of altering the existing agreements regarding customs duties, and he did not therefore think it advisable to press for a formal answer. The Government of Bombay approved of Major Ross’ proceedings, but directed him not to lose sight of the question, should a fitting opportunity for bringing it to the notice of the Muscat Government again occur, as it was of considerable importance that all restric tions which might tend to check the development of our trade in the Gulf should be removed. 357. On the 7th December 1872 Colonel Ross reported that the Sultan had consented to exempt vessels belonging to the British India Steam Naviga tion Company from the payment of any duty on cargo arriving from the Gulf, and transhipped into their steamers proceeding to Aden and Zanzibar, the Muscat authorities reserving their right to claim transhipment dues in all other cases. This promise, as regards transhipment by sea, was confirmed by the following letter from the Sultan, dated the 18th February 1873 :— “ In regard to exemption of duty on cargo transhipped at sea to ^he Zanzibar line of steamers from other mail steamers, according to the arrangement between me and Colonel Ross, I have exempted the duty, and have forbidden the Agent of the Customs to interfere in the same, and I will not go back from my word in a thing I have agreed to.” Revenue, June 1873, No. 19. The cordial acknowledgments of the Govern ment of India were conveyed to Syud Toorkee for this concession. 358. In May 1874 the Resident in the Persian Gulf forwarded copies of Political b., August 1874, Nos. correspondence relating to thg levy of duty upon 84-85. certain goods transhipped from the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Steam Ship Gunga. 359. In this case, it appeared the goods were not transhipped by sea, but were landed and stored for some days. The Sultan expressed his opinion, on the matter being referred to his decision, that duty was leviable, but he consented to remit the*sum of Rupees 1,800, leaving a balance of Rupees 3,056 still payable. This was handed by the Agent of the Company to the Political Agent under protest, and the orders of Government were solicited in the matter. The view taken by the Sultan was upheld by the Government of India on the srround that the concession only applied to Political B., August 1875, No. 86. J ^ goods transhipped by sea. 3GO. The next question that arose upon this subject was whether duty _ v w was leviable on goods landed from a vessel putting Political A., May 1875, Nos. 347-353. - .Tir j.j .1 C i.1 ^ into Muscat through stress ot weather, and reshipped in a different vessel, in consequence of the original vessel having sunk or become unseaworthy.361. After some discussion with the Sultan, who at first was not disposed to admit that the rules made by his hither, Syud Saeed, in 1846, were in force in Muscat, His Highness consented to forego all claim to duty even in the case of a vessel putting into Muscat for repairs, and reshipping her cargo in a different bottom. The translated purport*of the instrument passed by Syud Toorkee is as follows :— “ I have received j’our letter of the 2 nd instant, and have understood its contents, j abide by the agreement made by my father with the British Government regarding the customs duties leviable on goods landed from distressed vessels. For example if a vessel that puts into Muscat for repairs lands her cargo in order to undergo such repairs, and reships her cargo or puts it into another vessel, d forego all claim to duty for the sake of the unity between us and the British Government, and will raise no question concerning such goods, even though such were liable to duty in the time of our ancestors.” TIiq acknowledgments of the Government of India were conveyed to the Sultan for his friendly conduct on this occasion, and a report made to the Secretary of State. 362. Suppression of the Slave-Trade at Muscat.— The Poli tical Agent reported, on the 2nd October 1874, that the Treaties concluded in 1873 Political b., November 1874 , No. 4 . whh the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar for the more effectual suppression of the slave-trade had resulted satisfactorily, as no importations had taken place that season to Oman and the Persian Gulf. Her Majesty’s Ships Rifleman and Rhilomel had watched for sometime the entrance to the Gulf near Ras-el-Hadd, and had boarded a number of dhows, but had made no captures; nor was there any reason to suspect that slaves had been landed on the coast. Her !Vf ajesty’s Ship Daphne had also cruized along the southern coast of Arabia, and had searched a large number of vessels, but had not met with any slaves. Major Miles added that he had opportunities of extending his own personal enquiiies along the coast of Oman, and he was confident that importation for the present had wholly ceased. 363. Muscat claim to Charbar.— On the 17th October 1874 the Political a., December 1874, Nos. Resident in the Gulf forwarded two khureetas from 140 ^ 4 ' Syud Toorkee, addressed respectively to the Secretary of State and to the Viceroy and Governor-General, upon the subject of the claims of Muscat upon Charbar, which His Highness was under the impression had come within the purview of the Commissioner appointed for the settlement of the Mekran boundary. The following is the purport of the khureetas : ioni T °n!u r rl U 1 f? £ Salisbury, Principal Secretary of State for India, dated 27th Shaban 1291= 9th October 1874. I beg to acquaint \our Lordship that when the Commissioner appointed by the British Government for the settlement of the Mekran boundary arrived, and entered upon the duties no one was present at that time who could advise on our behalf with him, and who could point out the places which belonged to us, and hence the country known ua Charbar and bclono-ino- to us was apportioned to Persia, ft is possible the Commissioner acted inadvertently in this &amp; or that he was ignorant of the fact that the abovenamed country descended to us from our ancestors Out of respect to your Government we have hitherto refrained from asserting our rights to this tract ( diarbar), but we are certain you would never consent to this [viz., that Persia should deprive us of our rights]. • “ Certainly the British Government and the Oman Government are one, and our trust in all matters is centered m you.

It is possible that the Commissioner acted independently in this, or that he was ignorant of the fact that the abovenamed country descended to us from our ances tors. Out of respect to your Government we have hitherto refrained from asserting our rights to this tract (Charbar), but we are certain you would never consent to this (viz., that Persia should deprive us our rights). “Certainly the British Government and the Oman Government are one, and our trust in all matters is centered in you. Now our hope from the great Government is that the abovenamed tract fCharbar] will be restored to us, and incorporated in our dominions as it has been from of old. To remain silent regarding loss of territory and to be indifferent about it is improper. We place unbounded trust in the British Government, and it was necessary for to represent this matter to you.” 364. In reply, the Political Agent was instructed to acquaint Syud Toor- kee that there wqs “ no foundation for the idea that the port of Charbar was apportioned to Persia on the settlement of the Mekran boundary. Charbar was excluded altogether from General Gold- smid’s consideration by definite instruction, on the express ground that Muscat was not repre sented on the Commission. The proceedings of the Commission in no way affected any matter in dispute between Persia and Muscat. “ The Political Agent should remind His Highness that on a former occasion the British Government declined to interfere in respect to Charbar, and should inform him that it cannot interfere now. At the same time the Political Agent should use his endeavours to dissuade the Sultan from coming to a collision with Persia.” These explanations were “ personally and care- communicated” by the Political Agent to Toorkee.

Present of guns and rocket-tubes to Syud Toorkee.— , „ On the 7th March 1874, Colonel Koss reported General B., April 1874, No. 48. ,, , . iii 1 j . that a couple ot horses had been presented to Major Miles, and a horse and other articles to himself, and stated that he haa ordered the horses to be sent to Bombay for disposal. In reply, he was requested to state what return presents would be acceptable to His Highness. 366. The Political Agent on the 21st March reported that he had sold one horse to Admiral Gumming for Bupees 400, and that the Sultan had con sented to receive back the one presented to Colonel Ross. Shortly afterwards the Political Agent reported that the Sultan had presented him with a double- barrelled fowling piece, which he was instructed to forward to the Toshakhana. 367. In return for the presents, the value of which he estimated at Rupees 3,000, Colonel Ross recommends that General B., Feb. 1875, Nos. 35-42. ..A , ’ , ’ - n j , , , , , either two brass held guns and a rocket-tube, or a first class steam-launch, should be given to Syud Toorkee. 368. It was ultimately decided-to present the Sultan with two 6-pounder bronze guns with carriages and limbers complete, and two rocket-tubes for sea and land service respectively, at a total cost of about Rupees 3,375, and request was accordingly made to the Government of Bombay to supply the necessary articles. SECTION V. 369. Position and future prospects of Syud Toorkee at the end Of 1874. —On the 16th October Major Miles submitted an interesting Political a., December 1874 , Nos. report upon the position and prospects of Syud 116 ' 119 - Toorkee at Muscat. As this paper gives a resume of events at Muscat since the accession of Syud Toorkee in January 1871, and 83 Waffords an insight into the personal character of tlis Highness, it may be useful to quote it in extenso ;— “For the first ^hree years of Syud Toorkee^s rule since bis succession in January 1871 to the commencement of the present year, the only serious rivalry and opposition His Highness had to contend with was his nephew Syud Salim bin Thoweynee, who endeavoured to oust his uncle and recover possession of the throne from which he had been driven by Azan bin Ghais. In December 1872, however, Salim, tired of the struggle, retired to India, Syud Toorkee was left in undisputed possession, and the country enjoyed comparative tranquillity. Up to this time Syud Toorkee had suffered great pecuniary embarrassment owing to the insufficiency of his revenue to cover expenditure. Being an open-handed man, unaccustomed to control his monetary affairs, and having a Minister who was as unscrupulous as he was rapacious, his diffi culties only increased. The Minister, Thoweynee bin Mahomed, however seems to have been an able man and contrived to keep the tribes quiet and the country in fair order notwithstanding. Thoweynee was dismissed in December 1872 and was not replaced. Shortly after, early in 1873, His Highness, through Sir B. Frere's mission, received the guarantee of the Zanzibar subsidy and payment of tb arrears that had accrued, Here was Toorkee’s great opportunity had he but availed himself of it to consolidate his power, and establish himself firmly in his position. He was however, too shortsighted apparently to see the value of his husbanding his rqgpurces and forming a reserve, or too weak to control himself, and so long as the money lasted there was an unceasing How to the interior. The tribes came in in''shoals for presents, and their demands being complied with they remained quiet and contented. The subsidies paid half-yearly to the tribes were raised to nearly double what they had been in the days of Syud Saeed. This was the palmy time of Syud Toorkee's rule, but it could not last. A bad feature was that having no Minister or influential adviser to guide him he had to depend on menials and low favorities for advice and counsel and thus estranged his chief friends and supporters. Matters were in this state when in January 1874 Syud Toorkee was prostrated by a painful and dangerous illness, and rumours having been spread of his death, Sheikh Saleh bin Ali EUHarithee, who had been Wazeer at Muscat during the reign of Azan bin Ghais, and Syud Toorkee’s most bigoted enemy, made a sudden descent on Muscat in the hope of taking it by surprise and with a view of regaining the sovereignty for the Azan branch of the family, a young scion of which he brought with him for the purpose. After a bloody conflict outside Muttra with His Highness’ troops, in which Saleh bin Ali was victorious, he occupied that town for several days, and was thence enabled to dictate most humiliating terms to which Syud Toorkee was compelled to accede. Sheikh Saleh’s hold stroke at Muscat was thus eminently successful, and tiiough its final aspect was that of a mere plundering raid, it had a strange influence on the political situation of Oman, and has affected Syud Toorkee’s position and policy in a marked degree. From this time the real weakness and precariousness of Syud Toorkee’s grasp of power became at once apparent to the whole country, and his resources having now dwindled very low, disturbances and internal commotions arose everywhere, and for a considerable time His Highness’ position was undoub tedly highly critical. A direct result of Saleh’s raid has been singularly enough to separate Syud Toorkee from his old friends and allies, the Ghafirees, and to cause him to ally himself with the Hinawee division. It was the Beni Boo Ali and other Ghafiree tribes who put His Highness on the Sultanate by a successful attack on Azan bin Ghais, and the connection had hitherto been firmly maintained. During Saleh’s occupation of Muttra however not a single Ghafiree came to His Highness’ assistance, though, if they had been so inclined, a large body of them could have marched to Muttra within a few hours. Since this affair Saleh’s influence appears to have been predominant with Syud Toorkee, and the Hinawee alliance is an accepted fact. All the Ghafiree guards and garrisons have been dismissed, and Hinawees everywhere substituted. Whether this has been a politic step on His Highness’ part remains to be seen; to many well informed persons it seems that he has simply lost old friends without gaining new ones, as now both distrust him. Another important result affecting Syud Toorkee’s position and the state of parties generally has been the armed support by sea accorded to His Highness by the British Government and the effect of the aid so given in tranquillizing the country and putting down rebellion. Unfortunately no vessel of war had been present in time to avert the loss and humiliation suffered through Saleh’s raid, but it was promised to him for the future against rebels, and it is probably chiefly through the assistance he has received “ 1 The decision of Government of India to help Toorkee actively so far as guns of ships-of-war would reach was of course made known to His Highness, and undoubtedly by encour aging His Highness and his friends and damping the hopes of his enemies mainly conduced to the continuance of His Highness’ rule. The decision, though not in the form of a promise, would be looked on by the Sultan as the settled policy adopted in his behalf, and he will look for similar support in future emergencies.— (Sd.) E. C. Koss.” that he has been able to maintain his position 1 at all. Muscat had hardly recovered its equilibrium after the shock of Sheikh Saleh’s raid when Syud Ibrahim hin Ghais, who fortunately had not acted entirely in concert with Saleh in January, deemed it an excellent opportunity to emulate the example of his late brother Azan and endeavour to wrest the power from Toorkee’s hand. With this object, and seconded by Syud Hamad bin El Imam, lately become a rancorous enemy of Syud Toorkee, he placed himself at the head of the Bati- nah tribes, who have always shown themselves more favorable to that branch of the reigning family, and soon succeeded in gaining possession of the town and fort of Mesnaah, the 8485 seaport of El-liostak, and consequently a place of much importance to him. Here however his career was stayed. In capturing Mesnaah the British traders there were plundered and maltreated by his men and one killed, which occasioned the active interference of Govern ment. Syud Ibrahim was dislodged from Mesnaah, the fort was bombarded and destroyed by' the Political Resident with three ships-of-war, and subsequently, on proceeding to enforce the demand for reparation for British losses, the Political Resident succeeded at the same time in breaking up the coalition of the rebel tribes in the Batinah, in effecting a reconciliation between SyudToorkee and the rebel Yal Saad,and in entirely dissevering the connection between those tribes and Syud Ibrahim, whereby the latter has been so much discouraged that he has since made peace with His Highness, and has been granted an allowance on promise of future , TT . TT . . , . , ... submission. At one time, in April last, Syud Toorkee’s tenure “ 1 His Highness had up to this „ . ' i , n-i- period thought of abdicating ill despair of power was so insecure that he resolved on recalling his of being able to carry on the Govern- brother Abdool Azeez from India and associating him with ment.—(Sd.) E. C. koss.” himself in the Government . 1 Hitherto His Highness has had no reason to repent this step as Abdool Azeez has behaved very well and straightforwardly towards him. On the other hand, there is no doubt Abdool Azeez’s presence has been a source of strength to Toorkee, and Abdool Azeez has created a good impression in his favor in the . country so far as the Arabs have come in contact wdth ann y 3011 oimes ' 0 f him. Still SyudToorkee is certainly jealous of him, and I fancy that something like mutual distrust still exists betw«*n them . 2 teristic feature in Alboo Syud dynasty.--(Sd.) E. C. Ross. “ It thus will have been seen that Sheikh Saleh’s raid, though an insignificant affair per- haps in itself, has had most striking and important effects on Syud Toorkee’s position and policy ever since and in discovering the real flimsiness of Toorkee’s tenure of rule, has been the prime cause of all rebellions and internal commotions that have since agitated the country. All his rivals having been disposed of, and the country again in enjoyment of peace and pros perity, there is no reason why His Highness Syud Toorkee should not consolidate his power such as it is, and establish himself more firmly than he ever has been yet. His rule has never been more general, and extends over the whole of Oman, and there is no part that even claims to be independent of him, though practically of course his power does not extend much beyond Muscat. The chief drawback to his maintaining a firm position consists, in my opinion, in the weakness of his policy and his method of transacting his own business. It was his high reputation for personal daring and courage that made him so great a favorite in former days with the Arabs and led to his successful contest with Syud Azan for the Sultanate, but his character seems to have softened somewhat of late years. His public and avowed policy now is that he gives money only to those he fears and whom he wishes to conciliate, and thus he does not care to waste money on those whom he knows to be his friends and adherents. And His Highness not only declares this but acts upon it consistently j it is not to be wondered at therefore that disturbances are rife when supplies fall short. It is this policy added to his habit of leaning upon low favorites instead of on his relations and influential friends that prevents him attaining the firm and secure position he otherwise would have. Iheie can be little doubt that the aid His Highness has received from Government during these troublous times has had the chief share in tranquillizing the country, and, as it is, Syud Toorkee depends entirely on us for assistance and support in emergencies. Should, therefore, fresh disturbances and coalitions arise in the interior, and Muscat be again threatened, it would be to us that Syud Toorkee would first turn for help and counsel, and though the surface at present is fair and smooth, events follow so quickly in this country that it is impossible to foretell what the morrow may bring forth. On account of the amount of British interests at stake and the promise* of support accorded to Syud Toorkee, and on which he depends, it would clearly be impolitic and unadvisable to allow Muscat to remain without a vessel of war constantly on the Station , 4 but though the horizon is not free from disturbing elements, I do not anticipate any new dissensions, and I trust that Oman will continue in peace and tranquillity for a long time to come.” “ 3 Vide my Note l.--(Sd.) E. C. Ross.” “ 4 Under present circumstances all that can be undertaken in this respect is that Her Majesty’s vessels should frequently visit Muscat.” In my letter No. 456-90, dated 1st April 1874, I expressed an opinion in favor of Bombay Marine G,un-boat being at the disposal of the Political Agent, Muscat, permanently. (Sd.) E. C. Ross.” 370. The Government of India acknowledged the interest of this report but called upon Major Miles for an explanation of two passages (italicized) wherein the Political Agent referred to &amp; promise of support accorded to the Sultan by the British Government and His Highness’ dependence on that promise. * The attention of the Marine Department was also invited to the suggestion that Her Majesty’s vessels should under the circumstances reported visit Muscat as frequently as possible, and the Secretary of State was informed accordingly. 371. In reply, Major Miles explained that in using the word promise, he had in mind rather the view that would be Political a., March 1875, Nos. 531 - 534 . gy UC l Toorkee himself of the decision of86 Government regarding the support to be accorded to the Sultan under certain circumstances than the actual terms of the order Paragraph 265 of Precis. •, i p •. ■, • , i-u i , itselt, inasmuch as assistance having been once lent to him, he would naturally look for it again on future occasions. At the same time, Major Miles assured Government that a distinct promise of general and unconditional support was certainly not given by him to Syud Toorkee. This explanation was considered satisfactory by the Government of India. 372. Metowwa movement in South-Eastern Districts of Oman. —On the 24th December the Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that the Political Agent at Muscat reported that Political A., Feb. 1875, Nos. 42-44. .. , 55 , . 1 . ,, an “ extensive movement was in progress in south eastern districts of Oman among priestly faction,” and that he considered the presence of a man-of-war at Muscat desirable. Three days later he again telegraphed to the effect that the Metowwa movement was not progressing, and that there was “no urgency for man-of-war.” The reasons for the feeling of uneasiness which prevailed with reference to the Metowwa faction are given by Major Miles, under date 12th December 1874. The Political Agent stated :— “ About five days since one of the Sheikhs of the Hijrieen tribe of El-Sharkiyeh, named Eedr bin Mahomed bin Amiri, arrived at Muscat with the object of communicating to His Highness Syud Toorkee that the Moollas or Metowwas of the Hijrieen had for some time past been engaged in endeavouring to stir up a rising of all the tribes on behalf of the priestly faction against Syud Toorkee, and that Sheikh Munsoor of the Wahabee Bedowins who had joined the coalition had actually been to Sheikh Saleh bin Ali El-Harithee with proposals on the subject, but that Saleh had refused to join them on the ground that he was satisfied with Toorkee and intended to keep to his engagements. “ This morning I had a visit from this man, Bedr bin Mahomed, who informed me that the movement was fostered, if not entirely originated, by the Hijrieen Metowwas at the head of whom was Rashid bin Khulfan, who had received $1,600 from Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais for this purpose. He could assign no particular cause for the disaffection beyond a general rest lessness, and the inability of the Arab spirit to remain long quiet under one regime. “ I have not the slightest doubt but that this man Bedr is simply a spy sent here ostensi bly to make professions of friendship, but in reality to observe the state of affairs and to probe the general feeling. I consider it unlikely that Syud Ibrahim has sent any money to Sharkiyeh as his moves are generally too openly played to remain concealed, but it is highly probable that Feysul bin Hamood has done so, as Bedr bin Mahomed mentioned that a confidential messenger had passed between Rostak and the Hijrieen Metowwas not long back, and it is becoming generally believed that Feysul bin Hamood in his retirement from political affairs and ostentatious adop tion of austere and sanctimonious life is playing a deep and designing game, with a view to his being chosen by the people for the Imamate in the event of the religious faction coming again into power. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee has despatched a kossid to Sharkiyeh in connection with this matter, and will doubtless take such steps as he deems expedient.” '[Political A., February 1875, No. 46.] 373. During the absence of Syud Toorkee the Political Agent had advanced $5,000 from the subsidy, at the request of Abdool Azeez, and on the 20th December Major Miles solicited by telegraph that a further advance of the balance of subsidy due in January might be paid to Syud Toorkee, who had already received fifteen thousand dollars. This payment was authorized under the previous sanction of Government (paragraph 293 of Precis). Political a., February 1875, Nos. 374. The further progress of the Metowwa 4S ' 52 ' movement was thus described by Major Miles (19th December 1874):— “ fi ie rumour of a coalition in El Sharkiyeh among the priestly faction with a view to the re-establishment of an Imamate is gaining ground in Muscat, and it is now reported that Sheikh Saleh bin Ali has gone to Rostak possibly with the object of concerting measures with Syud Ibrahim or Feysul. J “ r L here can no longer be any doubt that an extensive movement is in progress in the districts of El Sharkiyeh and Oman among those inclined to the Metowwa party and those to whom change and disturbance are always welcome, but it appears as yet to be confined to those districts, as there are no signs of its influence in El Dhahireh, Jaalan, or the Batinah.87 x “The aspect of the affair will become more serious if it be the case that Saleh bin Ali has consented to .join the Metowwas and identify himself with the enterprise as he has undoubted energy, ability, and influence, and his powerful support will much invigorate and accelerate the organization of the rising. u There are at present a large number of interior Arabs at Muscat of the Bu Hassan, Beni Boo Ali, A1 Wahibah, Hejrieen, and other tribes, and I believe His Highness Syud 1 oorkee contemplates retaining some of those men as a garrison or protection for Muscat in the event of the hostile movement assuming more threatening proportions.” And on the 25th of the same month :— “ There have been no fresh rumours of late regarding the movement of the Metowwa faction in El Sharkiyeh, and it appears to have been somewhat checked for a time owing pro bably to the want of support and encouragement from the tribes. The report that Saleh bin Ali had gone to El Rostak to concert measures was premature, as he is still at Kabil in El Sharkiyeh, and so far, outwardly at least, has not connected himself with the undertaking. “ Syud Mahomed Azan, when calling on me this morning, informed me that Syud Ibrahim had received proposals from the faction to take the lead, but had declined to have any thing to do with it, and it had been consequently determined by the Metowwa to put up one of Syud Azan bin Ghais’s sons and to act in his name. The only one now available to their hands is Hamood, the same lad that was brought to Muttra by Saleh bin Ali for a similar purpose last January.” 375. On the 27th December Major Miles reported by telegraph that the Metowwa movement in El-Sharkiyeh was not progressing, and on the 2nd January 1875 he stated that later accounts continued to strengthen this impression, and to show that the movement was not generally viewed with favour throughout the country ; but he considered it improbable that it would alto gether subside, as the religious faction would no doubt continue to intrigue and test the feeling of the tribes until a more suitable opportunity presented itself. Nothing however could be expected to occur until after the Bakaree Eed, which would fall on the 20th January, but after that it would probably become suffi- Political a., February 1875, 55 . cieutl y a PP ar ? nt whether the Metowwa party felt strong enough to make a serious movement, or considered it advisable to postpone their design for a more fitting season. 37G. Notwithstanding these apprehensions, the outward appearance of the country was tranquil at the close of 1874. The Beni Boo Ali tribe in Jaalan had at length amicably adjusted an intestine* feud that had been going on among themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other ; and as regarded the wounded (about seventy in number), the blood-money was to be determined by a reference to the Mahomedan law. The only important question that required adjustment was the conflict between the Hinawee and Ghafiree tribes in the provinces of Oman and El-Dhahireh. 377. Position and prospects of Syud Toorkee at the com mencement Of 1875.— On the 26th February Major Miles submitted Major Miles’ No. 97-45, dated 26th further observations on the position and prospects February i87o. 0 f gy iu l Toorkee. These remarks will be found of interest :— “Since I last wrote on Bis Highness’ position and prospects, I consider they have changed for the worse; the feebleness and incertitude of his Government have never been more apparent, and 1 suppose his tenure of power has never been more insecure than it is at present. “ I have remarked before on His Highness’ dependence on low favorites in preference to more sound advisers. His Highness’ affairs are now managed almost entirely by a man named Mesh, who has more authority in Muscat at present than any one else, and who has charge especially of all pecuniary transactions. This person is a man of the lowest origin and character, and has neither capacity, tact, nor knowledge to recommend him to his present position. I need hardly add that he makes use of his position for his own advantage. “ It is this man’s advancement and proceedings that have, I think, more than anything else, estranged His Highness’ best friends and are the chief cause of His Highness’ unpopularity. Syud Abdool Azeez and Syud Mahomed Azan, the Walee, now refrain, as much as possible, from giving counsel even when asked, as they do not care about seeing their advice over-ruled by one so inferior in every respect to themselves.88 « X believe that the hopes of the people generally are now turned to Syud Abdool Azeez, who, by his circumspect and dignified behaviour during the past ten months, has succeeded in creating a very favorable impression on all who have come in contact with him. « it S eems to me most important to separate His Highness from his unworthy advisers and to invigorate his Government, and I consider this would be most effectually and permanently done bv advising His Highness to make Syud Abdool Azeez joint ruler with himself as his father and uncle were conjoint rulers halt a century ago. dimply to thiow off his favorites would not, I think, be sufficient now, as His Highness has not shown himself a very success ful or vigorous ruler, and the tide of public opinion seems to be setting in against him. “ His Highness is well aware of the present state of affairs and does not disguise it from himself. He informed me on the last interview with him that he had offered to his brother Abdool Azeez to resign the Government in his favor and retire to Gwadur, but that Abdool Azeez had declined to accept it. His Highness is greatly harassed by his pecuniary embarrass ments, and, I think, feels himself unequal to carrying on the business of Government alone much longer. He has not, however, requested my advice on the subject, and what I have submitted is entirely my own view of his position.” Colonel Ross’ No. 277-125, tinted 6th March 1875. Colonel follows :—- Ross instructed Major Miles as “ In case His Highness should voluntarily confide in you on the subject of his affairs and ask your advice, it would be proper to state the opinion you have formed, and which I share, of the dissatisfaction caused by His Highness relying on one person of inferior standing to exclusion of all others of his relations and well-wishers, but should His Highness wish to effect a reform in this matter, it would be best that his choice of advisers should be Spontaneous. “ As regards your suggestion of a joint rulership, I think that Government would not wish, even if the proposal came from Syud Toorkee, to be committed to an opinion in favor of the measure, although I have no reason to suppose it would be our duty to oppose it. In case your advice is sought on that; or any equally important matter, you should refer for instructions. At the same time you should, whenever occasion serves, endeavour to promote good-will and mutual confidence*between His Highness Syud Toorkee and his brother Abdool Azeez. “ You will, of course, use all your influence to cheer His Highness to meet and overcome his troubles and dissuade him from any premature relinquishment of his position of Sultan.” 378. In the letter* comraunicatinor the appro- * No. 1200P., dated 30th April 1875. &amp; J u rt 1 val ot Government to the views expressed b} 7 Colo nel Ross, the following emphatic passage occurs :— “ It is the decided opinion of the Governor-General in Council that the Political Agent at Muscat will do well to avoid interference in the dynastic and internal affairs of Oman,” No. 100, dated 13th May 1875. and in reporting these proceedings to the Secretary of State, it was observed :— “ In the opinion of the Political Agent at Muscat, the state of affairs in Oman has of late grown critical owing chiefly to the weak character of the Sultan, but partly also to the progress of the “ Metowwa” or fanatical faction, and partly to the disputes between the Hinawee and Ghafiree tribes, which Syud Toorkee has hitherto failed to settle, and which may result in an outbreak of civil war. “ Under these circumstances the Political Agent suggested that Abdool Azeez, the brother of Syud Toorkee, should be associated with him in the Government as the best means of propping up the fabric of the State. We are, however, decidedly of opinion that the Sultan should be allowed to manage the internal affairs of his kingdom without inter ference, and that the action of our officers in such matters should be confined to giving advice when solicited.” 379. Arrangements at Sohar. —Major Miles reported on the 13th Major Miles’ No. 121 - 58 , dated MArcli thtit feyud looikee held recently come to a, i3th March 1875. fresh arrangement with Syud Bedr bin Saif at Sohar (paragraph 261), by which His Highness would save about $400 a month. Syud Bedr had consented to his mofithly pay of $300 being discontinued and the Wahabee garrison of fifty men being reduced to twenty. The revenue of Sohar, about eight or nine thousand dollars yearly, would remain as formerly at Syud Bedr’s disposal for expenses.89 SECTION VI. 380. Syud Toorkee’s change of policy in substituting Hi- nawee guards for Wahabees.— On the 2nd January 1875 Major Miles Political a., February 1875 , Nos. reported that Syud Toorkee had for some time past 51 ' 52, been gradually reducing the strength of the Waha- bee garrison at Muscat, and that he had now dismissed most of the remainder of these men from his service, replacing them by parties drawn from the various Hinawee tribes, such as the Beni Bu Hassan, El-Hejrieen, &amp;c. The so-called Wahabees were Arabs from Nejd and El-Hasa, and at one time numbered about four hundred in Muscat and Muttra; they were good soldiers, and being inde pendent of the various factions and parties in Oman, were always considered the real strength of Muscat. 381. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, in transmitting this report, con curred with Major Miles in considering that, although this measure was one of which the wisdom could only be judged of by results, it appeared to be of doubtful expediency. The advantages of maintaining a standing guard of foreigners was obvious, and, although the change w'ould undoubtedly be popular with the Hinawee tribes, and increase the Sultan’s influence with these clans, it would have the effect of placing him more completely in their power than formerly. The matter was, however, one of internal administration, and the Political Agent, in Colonel Ross’ opinion, acted rightly in abstaining from advising His Highness either for or against the measure. 382. Disturbances at Muscat.— On Lieutenant-Colonel Miles reported that Muscat Lieutenant-Colonel Miles to Lieute nant-Colonel Ross, No. 204-82, dated 14th May 1875. See letter from Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 553-145, dated 28th May 1875. the 14 th May, however, was in a somewhat dis turbed state owing to misunderstandings that had arisen between Syud Toorkee and the Beni Bu Hassan tribe, who had made certain demands upon H is Highness which the latter had not satisfied. A number of this tribe had lately arrived from Jaalan, and although % that por tion which was entertained at Muscat on regular pay at first sided with the Sultan against their tribesmen, yet when thev found that His Highness had arranged to comply with the demands of the latter, some further difficulty arose, and His Highness imprudently informed both parties “that he considered them all alike, and desired to have nothing more to do w th any of them.” Both parties then made common cause, and declared that, if their demands were not satisfied, they would plunder the town, and leave His Highness to bear the consequences. An affray took place in the town on the night of the 13th May, and two or three men were wounded, but no plundering occurred. 383. Flight of Syud Toorkee on board a vessel in Muscat Harbour. —On the morning of the 14th May Syud Abdool Azeez came to Lieutenant-Colonel Miles and informed him that Syud Toorkee had quitted the palace secretly in the dead of night, and had gone no one knew whither, leaving him (Abdool Azeez) to bear the brunt atone. 384. One of Syud Toorkee’s advisers, Ibrahim El-Awesi, was then sent for. This man stated that Syud Toorkee had gone on board a merchant vessel lying in the harbour, in a canoe in the night, and that he was then on board. Ibrahim also stated that the Bu Hassan had agreed to behave peaceably and remain quiet, if their present requests were complied with, and if Syud Abdool Azeez would guarantee that Syud Toorkee would fulfil his engagements with them for the future. 385. Acting upon the Political Agent’s advice, Abdool Azeez went on board the vessel-to induce Syud Toorkee to come on shore and make some arrangement with the tribe. He returned shortly afterwards with full powers from Syud Toorkee to make terms with the Arabs, and with a promise that Syud Toorkee would come on shore as soon as arrangements were concluded,386. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles stated that as British interests would suffer most in the event of any disturbance occurring, he would insist on His Highness making some sacrifices to preserve peace and order in the town, should the effects of Abdool Azeez to effect an arrangement prove unavailing. In the opinion of the Political Agent, matters had reached this crisis solely through Syud Toorkee’s vacillation and want of firmness in dealing with the Bu Hassan tribe, and it was to be feared that the rumour of what had occurred would have a disturbing effect on the country generally, as showing the increas ing weakness of Syud Toorkee’s Government. Lieutenant-Colonel Boss concurred in this opinion. 387. The proceedings of Lieutenant-Colonel Miles were approved by the between Syud Toorkee and the Bu Hassan tribe, the demands made by that tribe upon His Highness, and the conditions which had been arranged with them, in order that the Government of India might be enabled to understand the position of affairs. 388. Causes of the dispute between Syud Toorkee and the Bu Hassan Tribe.— In reply, Colonel Miles reported that the dis- Lieutenant-Colonel Miles’No.327-120, ar °f ^ ^OUg a party of the Bu H aSSall then formed the garrison should be dismissed, and themselves entertained in their stead, as they considered the others had enjoyed the emoluments of office long enough. They were also dissatisfied with the provisions furnished for their support and with the sum of money offered them. 389. His Highness did not accede to their wishes, or take any steps to allay their disaffection, which continued to increase until the garrison, who were thegiselves considerably in arrears of pay, joined them, and His Highness then found himself in the position described above. 390. The conditions His Highness was ultimately compelled to make with the tribe were that their demands as regarded food and subsidy should be complied with ; that the party forming the garrison should be relieved every three months by others of the tribe ; and that the Sheikhs should visit Muscat every six months to receive the usual subsidies. His Highness also repeated a former promise to consult with the tribe on occasions of difficulty in the poli tical affairs of the country. 1 391. _lhe settlement of these demands, and the payment of arrears due to the garrison, cost His Highness about $1,700. 392. Wish of Syud Toorkee to abdicate.— These arrangements having been concluded, Syud Toorkee returned on shore, and the greater part Lieutenant-Colonel Miles’No. aan.ss ^ the Bcdaween left Muscat the foliowinor dav. and coldness existed between them and Syud Toorkee, and on two occasions there was danger of a rupture occurring. • 39 ^' -^ n t ^ ie 25th . Ma y&gt; Colonel Miles had a visit from Syud Toorkee who informed him that he wished to leave Muscat by the Mail Steamer expected to arrive the next day and proceed to Kurrachee, where he could reside in peace as he could no longer bear the burden of Government, on account of the insolence of the tribes, who were tired of him and no longer desired him as He therefore intended to abdicate in favor of his brother Abdool Azeez whom fi , 0 people had come to prefer to himself, and he would trust to his brother's generosity to make G. 0.

Forwarded tribe that had arrived in Muscat from Soor with August I 875 . er No '■ 331 ' 3, dated 5th th ® usual object of obtaining presents from His Highness. They desired that their tribesmen who these men behaved quitely, a good deal of mistrust 9091 Y some provision for his residence in India. His Highness hinted that his life was in danger from the Bedaweens, and said that if he could not go in the steamer, he would take his depar ture in a country boat.” 394. Colonel Miles told His Highness he was afraid he was not well that morning, or that he had been much annoyed by something to cause him to speak in that way. The Political Agent said that it was impossible for him on the part of Government to countenance his leaving Muscat in such a precipitate manner, without any arrangements having been made for the security of the town and merchants, as the Bedaween would be certain to take advantage of the confusion consequent on his departure to plunder the place, and he added that if His Highness had firmly resolved on the step of resigning the Sultanate of Oman, he should at least give time for the Political Resident in the Gulf to be informed, as that officer could then communicate with His Highness, and make such arrangements as he might think proper in the matter. Colonel Miles endeavored at the same time to encourage His Highness in every way, and to dissuade him from his purpose. 395. His Highness said he had contemplated the step for the past two or three months, and had determined to have nothing more to do with the Gov ernment of the country. 396. Colonel Miles had another interview with Syud Toorkee a few hours afterwards at his own palace, and again pointed out to him the weakness and imprudence of the step he proposed to take. His Highness seemed very des pondent, and did not attempt to refute Colonel Miles’ arguments, but said he would reconsider his decision in the matter. 397. The step was distasteful to all Syud Toorkee’s best friends and advisers, including his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, Syud Hillal, and Syud Mohammed Azzan. These all strongly opposed His Highness’ resolution to abandon the Government, and Colonel Miles believed they were greatly em barrassed at the announcement of his intention. As for Abdool Azeez, Colonel Miles had reason to believe that overtures had been made to him by some of the Bedaween to oust his brother Toorkee, and that he had unhesitat ingly refused the offer, and had declared himself faithful to his brother’s interests. 398. On the 26th May, Colonel Miles received an intimation from His Highness that he had abandoned for the present his intention of quitting the country, and that he \vould do his best to carry on the Government. 399. In the opinion of Colonel Miles, His Highness was serious in his intention to leave Muscat, and he believed he was chiefly induced thereto by his pecuniary embarrassments, by the vexatious annoyances of the Bedaween, and by the advice of his favourite and counsellor, Mesh, who was anxious to exchange Muscat for a safer ‘and more pleasant residence (paragraph 307 of Precis). 400. Colonel Ross, in forwarding this report, was of opinion that the unfavourable condition of Syud Toorkee’s affairs could not but give rise to apprehensions. It was impossible to look with confidence to' a steady con tinuance of His Highness’ rule. This unfortunate aspect of affairs was caused by defects of internal administration which could not be controlled or remedied by the Political Officers of the Government of India. Colonel Ross added that as it might be advisable for a vessel of war to remain for the present at Muscat, or within his reach, he would endeavor to make an arrangement with the Senior Naval Officer for that purpose. 401. Colonel Ross also forwarded a copy of the following letter which he had addressed to the Sultan of Muscat on the 4th June :— “ I have received information from Lieutenant-Colonel Miles of the nature of some im portant communications which Your Highness had made to that officer.92 “Whilst feel in 0, extremely grieved that certain annoyances should have caused Your High ness to entertain momentarily an idea of leaving Muscat, I beg to express my satisfaction that I am able to report to Government that Yoxu- Highness has abandoned such an idea. “I concur entirely with Lieutenant-Colonel Miles in the views he expressed to Your Highness, and would teg to add my friendly and respectful request that Your Highness will be o’ood enough to refrain from any premature step of the nature lefeiied to. «i can assure Your Highness that His Kxcellency the Viceroy of India in Council regards the Government of Your Highness with friendly interest, and, sympathising with the difficulties which as Euler of Oman you necessarily have to encounter, would be glad to see you meet them successfully and continue to administer the Government of Muscat. “ I beo 1 to thank Your Highness for accepting the advice of Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, and it is my earnest request that you will continue to do so in matters especially which, like what is here alluded to, would affect the interests of British subjects. “ Trusting Your Highness is well and hoping to be honored by frequent news of Your Highness' welfare.' 402. On the 10th of June Colonel Miles reported* that His Highness „ „ .. |.. . „ t „ . Syud Toorkee had not again recurred to the subject Gulf, No. 650 - 168 , dated zSth June ot his leaving Muscat and seemed to be in sonie- 1875 - what better spirits. His Highness’ relations with the Bedaweens appeared to continue friendly and satisfactory. f Received with letter from Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 681-174, dated 1st July 1875. 403. Quarrel between His Highness Syud Toorkee and Syud Abdool A zeez. —In the concluding paragraph of his letter No. 248-94, dated the 24th of June 1875,f regarding the Semail difficulty, (paragraphs 303-1G) Colonel Miles inti mated that a difference had occurred between His Highness Syud Toorkee and his brother Syud Abdool Azeez about the farm of the Custom House. Colonel Miles said that he had proffered his good officers in view to promoting a reconciliation, and he promised a further report on the matter. X From Political Resident, Persia,, &lt;-&gt; n the 8th of July Colonel Miles reported J that Gulf, No. 762-iyi, dated 2ist July the quarrel between the brothers was at an end, a 18/0 ' reconciliation between them having been effected. Colonel Miles gave the following account of the disagreement. 404. On the morning of the 24th June he received a visit from Syud Abdool Azeez, who informed him that he had fallen out with his brother Syud Toorkee and was satisfied neither with his treatment of him nor with the state of affairs, and he requested Colonel Miles’ mediation in the matter, as unless some amelioration took place in these matters, he had no desire to remain longer in Muscat. Abdool Azeez stated that his complaint was chiefly against his brother’s favorite servant Mesh, who was plundering Syud Toorkee right and left, and who was placed in a position by Syud Toorkee that was an insult to him (Abdool Azeez). He said that a few days before, while taking over the accounts of the Customs House on its transfer to another farmer, he found that Mesh had been accustomed to take over all the receipts, for which he had rendered no proper account, and that he also held an order from Syud Toorkee for $10,000 for money and articles said to have been supplied. He (Abdool Azeez) had called upon Mesh to produce his vouchers for this claim, but he had only been able to do so for $2,000 or $3,000 and could give no satisfactory account of the rest. Abdool Azeez added that he had only interfered in this matter with the best intentions and on behalf of his brother’s interests, which were being entirely sacrificed by this man, who robbed him most unscrupulously. Three years ago the man was selling sugar-cane in the streets, and though his present pay from Toorkee was only $L5 a month, he had managed to amass a sum of over $40,000. Abdool Azeez further said that his own counsel and that of Toorkee’s best friends was entirely disregarded if it differed from Mesh’s, as his advice always prevailed, and that the Sheikhs of the tribes and influential people of the country were disgusted with Syud Toorkee chiefly on account of the proceedings of this man. He said his brother must choose between him self and Mesh, as he (Abdool Azeez) did not wish to be longer concerned in the93 n 1 * 4 f- Government if matters were to continue thus. He was incurring the odium of the people as well as Toorkee, and his own character in their eyes and his future prospects were being injured thereby. 405. Colonel Miles visited His Highness Syud Toorkee the same day, informed him of the substance of what Syud Abdool Azeez had said, and expressed his regret at hearing of the difference between him and his brother. Colonel Miles then offered his good offices in promoting a reconciliation. 406. His Highness Syud Toorkee replied that he had no quarrel with his brother Abdool Azeez whatever, and was not in the least angry or displeased with him. That Abdool Azeez had made some request about Mesh which he (Toorkee) had been unable to grant—but nothing more. Colonel Miles said that he was sure Abdool Azeeez was offended, and he pointed out that His Highness would best consult his own interests by seeking to be reconciled with him and regaining his friendship. His Highness said he accepted his advice and would go over that evening to Syud Abdool Azeez’s house and make friends with him. 407. Accordingly Syud Toorkee went to the house of Abdool Azeez that evening accompanied by his brother Mahomed bin Azzan to whom he granted full powers to settle the dispute and then returned to his palace. Nothing, however, came of Mahomed bin Azzan’s mediation, for on the following day (25th June) His Highness wrote to Colonel Miles :— “The final reply of Abdool Azeez to Mahomed was that a reconciliation could not be effected save by the dismissal of Mesh. On being told my brother’s reply, I could not help considering him foolish, since there is a wide difference between him and Mesh, and Mesh can not be in opposition to him. Tl\p doings of my servants for good or for evil reflect on me alone, and 1 cannot see that Abdool Azeez has any right to interfere.' “ As you are aware, his coming to Muscat was on an agreement entered into, and if the vexatious interference in matters of State such as he (Abdool Azeez) presumes on form a part of such agreement, I shall consider myself bound by the same and shall carry it out in the spirit in which it was drawn up in the presence of the representatives of your Government. Mesh has not committed himself to merit being degraded and dismissed, and he is our slave, ever ready to carry out our behests. Would it be well, therefore, to punish him without a fault, punishment being the reward and fruit of wrong-doings ? “ As it is known to you, only the other day our brother Majeed made a selection and put in a position of responsibility and trust one from among his subjects, and in the present we have my brother Burgash raising from amongst strangers and placing above his nobles and brothers a man of humble circumstances. Neither met with any remonstrances in the carrying out of their wishes. How then can I do this? For, as it is, on the mere rumour of such a demand having been made, most of my friends have taken alarm, judging it just possible a similar demand may be preferred against them. “ We after this sent to our brother Abdool Azeez our brother Mahomed bin Azzan and with him Khamis bin Ilassan, that they may confer with him and persuade him to be reason able. This they endeavoured hard to effect. At first this appeared hopeless, but eventually he consented to fall into my wishes on condition he was allowed to keep to his house and not be required to give advice in any matters concerning State or otherwise. This was the final result of their endeavours. Under the above condition, how can it ever be possible for us to be intimate or in unity ? If my brother is to stay in Muscat, 1 must meet him and get his assistance and advice on all matters and points on which I may require them. From his remaining in retirement difficulties and dangers will arise from the people of Oman, and opportunity will be given them by the difference between us to raise the standard of revolt. “ Now we refer to you and put ourselves in your hands. Whatever decision you arrive at we must abide by.” ^ &gt; 408. Colonel Miles then called on His Highness and urged him not to let others place obstacles in the way of friendship, but to give some consider ation to his brother’s requests; and he suggested to His Highness that he should allow Abdool Azeez to investigate Mesh’s accounts, which would give the man an opportunity of clearing himself from the charges made against him,—or if Abdool Azeez’s suspicions turned out correct, His Highness would be able to rid himself of a man who had abused his confidence so greatly. His Highness assented to this at the time, and said he would send Mesh over to Abdool Azeez, to be dealt with as the latter pleased.94 409. Syud Toorkee nevertheless afterwards changed his mind, writing to Colonel Miles on the 29th of June :— “ I beo &gt; to inform you that I sent yesterday to you our brother Mahomed bin Azzan in order that°he mig-ht acquaint you with the nature of the accounts outstanding against us in favor of Mesh. These are not entered in Ids hooks, and are cheques and orders drawn on him; the largest item of the amount due him being cash under this head, the balance being for rice and coffee supplied. He presented all these orders and cheques to us and rendered an account, vouched j the total shown hy him I acknowledge to be conect, because I have received the value of the same. Under these circumstances, I see no ^ny of disputing any of these items after these have been proved against me and acknowledged, neither do I. see a 'ay open to me of going into these accounts again, since when the account was first presented the vouchers were examined and found correct : these latter were then destroyed. How then would it be becoming or just of me to refuse the debt against me ? And I cannot perceive any way open for my brother Abdool Azeez to call him (Mesh) to account again for charges which 1 have acknowledged. “ I trust in you, therefore, to dissuade and prohibit him (Abdool Azeez) from doing what there is no means of his completing satisfactorily, and which you so well understand. “ I beg for a written reply to this, as we place our trust and faith in such reply. “On the 22nd* current we addressed you by letter, in which we communicated briefly , . , „ , the proceedings of our brother alluded to, *but received no * A clerical error for 2oth. . 1 , , ,, CT i. i i • u i i i c i i reply by letter as we expected, hoping it would be favourable. This is a well-known rule and procedure in all correspondence and is essential/’ 410. To this Colonel Miles replied on the same day :— “ [ have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness’ letter of this day’s date on the subject of the difference between Your Highness and Syud Abdool Azeez, and inform ing me that Your Highness does not concur with me as .to the expediency of meeting the views of Syud Abdool Azeez regarding the accounts of Your Highness’ servant Mesh. “ Having a conviction of the importance of Your Highness being in concord and unity with Syud Abdool Azeez, both as regards the stability of Your Highness’ Government and general interests, I considered it my duty to offer my good offices in promoting a reconciliation, and with this view I advised Your Highness to let no light matter stand in the way of a reconcilement and,renewal of intimacy with Your Highness’ brother. “ As, however, my advice and proposals do not appear altogether acceptable to Your High ness, it is only left for me to communicate the circumstances to Colonel Ross for the informa tion of Government, who I feel sure will learn with much regret of the estrangement between Your Highness’ brother and of my unsuccessful endeavours to restore confidence and friend ship betw’een you. “ With regard to Your Highness’observation that I have not replied to Your Highness’ first letter, 1 respectfully remind Your Highness that I have since had the honor of a personal interview with Your Highness, and I am not aware that I have left any point raised hy Your Highness unconsidered.” 411. In the meantime Syud Toorkee had sent for his uncle, Syud Hilal, the chief person in Muscat next to himself and Abdool Azeez, and requested him to mediate in the matter. This resulted in Syud Hilal writing to Abdool Azeez and saying that Syud Toorkee would comply with his request and send Mesh to him for examination. This, however, was not done as His Highness again changed his mind on the subject, and Syud Hilal’s intervention ceased. After again seeing Abdool Azeez, Colonel Miles called on His Highness and informed him that he could no longer interfere in the matter, and that it was his intention to telegraph at once to Colonel Ross the state of affairs for the information of Government. His Highness then said he had resolved on send ing Mesh away from Muscat for a time at least, and he hoped his brother Abdool Azeez would be satisfied with the arrangement, as he (Toorkee) was anxious to put an end to the estrangement and be on amicable terms again. Colonel Miles told His Highness he had adopted a wise course, as the estrange ment between him and his brother was undoubtedly being anxiously watched by his enemies, and dissensions and disturbances would certainly arise if it continued much longer. His Highness had an interview with his brother that night, and a reconciliation took place then between them; Syud Abdool Azeez having agreed to the arrangement that Mesh should leave Muscat.95 z 412. Syud Toorkee again expresses a wish to abdicate. Orders of Government in regard to aid to be afforded to Syud Toorkee.—On the 13th of July 1875, Colonel Ross telegraphed :— * u Following message, dated Muscat 11th, received from Political Agent:—Toorkee lias again expressed wish to abdicate in favor of Abdool Azeez, and appears serious in his resolve. lie is quite helpless and unable to control events.

Your presence would be benefieial when convenient. Wimble here. Message ends.” 413. To the above the Resident added :— “ I have telegraphed for Daphne to proceed from Henjam to Muscat, and am prepared to proceed there myself, if Government approve. I presume Government would wish me to endeavour to dissuade Syud Toorkee from abdication. I respectfully solicit the earliest possible instructions, as communications with Muscat are now so limited.” 414. Two days afterwards, 15th July, Colonel Ross again telegraphed “ Referring to my message of 13th, I purpose leaving for Muscat to-morrow by mail steamer. Please let telegrams for me be addressed Bushire, as usual. In case of Sultan requiring active aid, I shall till further orders be guided by instructions in your telegrams dated 20th January and 13th March 1874. If Sultan should ask further advance of subsidy, would Government give me a discretionary power in that matter, or wish me to refer for orders ?” 415. The telegrams of the Government of India alluded to by Colonel Ross related to 1. The occupation ot Muttra by Syud Salim bin Thoweynee. ,„ ^ .. i. u !&gt;• 2.

Ruler of MllSCat.t 416. In the case of the occupation of Muttra by Salim, which resulted in the plunder of British subjects living there, the Government of India, Toorkee having solicited interference, directed the Resident to demand satisfaction from the rebel holders of Muttra for injury done to British subjects, and, if this was refused, to bombard the fort after 48 hours’ notice. The Resident was further given full power to help Syud Toorkee actively so far as the guns of the vessels of war would reach, and to protect British interests, but he was to undertake no operations on shore.^ I n the matter ot the + Pitcis, paragraph 200 . attack on Batinah Ibrahim was to be told that as Syud Toorkee was an ally of the British Government his rebellious proceedings were viewed with displeasure ; and that he would be held responsible for injury caused to British subjects, and would be required, if necessary, to make reparation. In the event of Ibrahim attacking Muscat the instructions in Saleh’s case were to apply.S But as neither of these cases § Precis, paragraph 271 . was similar to the one under reference, Colonel Ross was addressed by telegram No. 2043P., dated 16th July 1875, as follows :— “ Your telegrams of 13th and 15th July. “ Enough already said in your letter of 4th June to Toorkee dissuading him from resigna tion.

In his subsequent letters marginally noted, Colonel Ross reported fullv on the matters brought to notice in his tele grams of the 13th and 15th of July. !j “ It is the decided opinion of the Governor-General in Council that the Political Agent at Muscat will do well to avoid interference in the dynastic and internal affairs of Oman.” (Precis, paragraph 378).

Early in the month of July 1875 His Highness Syud Toorkee received a letter from one of the Sheikhs of the A1 Wahibeh, Hameyed bin Khalifeen, informing him that another Sheikh of the same tiibe named Hamood bin Sy ud/with whom he was not on good terms, was collecting his men and intended mischief at Muscat and Muttra. He (Hameyed bin Ehalifeen) theie- fore intended despatching his son with an ecpial loice to ^Muscat, in oidei to support His Highness should they attempt to oppose him in any way. Iho plot was too transparent for His Highness not to see through it at once, so he sent to close the passes in front of these men. It was too late, howevei, and on the nio-ht of the 5th July the two parties, numbering it was said several hundred men, arrived at Muttra, which they occupied without opposition. In the morning they sent to His Highness to say that their intentions were friendly, and His Highness deeming it best apparently to make no opposition sent permission for them to enter Muscat. * From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 762-11)1, dated 21st July 1875. 420. In his letter No. 28G-108, dated 8th July, Colonel Miles reported * that “the cause of this rising on the part of the A1 Wahibeh was, there is little doubt, the rupture between Ilis Highness and Syud Abdool Azeez, which the tribe believed to be complete. Their object in coming was to depose Syud Toorkee in favor of ^bdool Azeez, if the latter would accept it.” 421. However this may have been, His Highness having allowed his unwelcome visitors to enter his town did not know very well how to get them out again; but judging it chiefly to be a question of dollars began to treat with them accordingly in the hope of getting rid of them the same day, and he requested from Colonel Miles an advance ot $3,000 (Rupees G,480). As by the end of the month a half yearly instalment of subsidy would be due to His Highness, and as a refusal would have seriously embarrassed the Sultan and have perhaps led to disturbances which would have greatly complicated matters, Colonel Miles considered that he would be acting for the best if he made the advance, which he accordingly did. His proceedings were approved in the letter of the Government of India, No. 2251P., dated 13th August 1875, it being added.—“ It is presumed that the advance has already been recovered out of the t i,e., of subsidy. half-yearly payment f due at the end of July.” 422. The Sultan’s next step w T as to treat with the tribe and discuss the various conditions required by them. At the time of Colonel Miles’ letter (8th July) the negotiations had not been concluded, but the Political Agent believed that the Sheikhs had been promised a sum of $2,000 on their quitting the town. 423. The leader of the party, Sheik Hamood bin Syud (who was Saleh , . . bin Ali’s Lieutenant in the attack on Muttra in + I,rtusparagrrtph “ Go ’ January;}; 1874), visited Colonel Miles on 7th July and requested him to guarantee the fulfilment of any conditions that might be agreed upon between them and His Highness, because, as the Sheikh plainly said, they had no confidence in Syud Toorkee’s good faith. “ The proposal,” said Colonel Miles,— “ of course was at once and effectually declined by me, but without, I believe, prejudicin O' H is Highness* position in any way. The Sheikh u'as made to understand at the same time that no actual violence towards Ilis Highness or injury to British interests would be tolerated.” § From Political Resident, Persian 424 ' . 0n the 20t }i ° f Jul y&gt; lette1 ' No. 303-112, Gulf, No. 768 - 193 , dated 24th July Colonel Miles reported^ that the conditions required by the A1 Wahibeh Bedaweens, and to which the Sultan had agreed, were— HL—That he should retain the following number of Hinawees as his paid guard or garrison in Muscat and Muttra, viz .— 50 A1 Wahibeh. 50 Beni bu Hassan. 50 El Hejrieen.97 Zncl .—That Mahomed bin Senan, the Wallee of the Ghaffiree garrison of Fort Semail, should be dismissed and a Belooch garrison substituted. 3rd.—That the remainder of the Wahibeh guard in Muscat should be dismissed—all but thirty camel sowars. ith .—That the Beni Hadther should no longer have charge of the gates of Muttra. bth .—That 100 men should be retained at Muscat as a following for Syud Abdool Azeez when he proceeds into the interior to settle internal disputes or punish the refractory. 425. His Highness Syud Toorkee resolves on leaving Muscat. —About three days after the above conditions had been agreed to by His Highness, the Bedaweens, seeing no signs of their fulfilment, again became troublesome; and His Highness being equally out of patience and annoyed with them, and being moreover apprehensive of consequences to himself, resolved to remain in Muscat no longer and commenced making preparations for departure. Subsequently, however, His Highness carried out the conditions he had agreed to, so far as he was able, by dismissing the Wahibehs, retaining Sheikh Hamood bin Syud with a number of his men to act as Syud Abdool Azeez’s field force, and by despatching an order to Mahomed bin Senan and Ghaffiree garrison to evacuate the fort of Semail. But even then a difficulty occurred, the Ghaffirees refused to give up the fort to the officer sent by Syud Toorkee, and so the second condition remained unfulfilled. 426. Further Estrangement between Syud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez. —When reporting the measures * No. 303-112, dated 20tli July 1875. , TV c u . ^ „ i ii- Q From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, &lt;lcloptG(l by tllG Sultcin. to CJUlGt tllC rGUGlllOUS No. 768-193, dated 24th July 1875. Bedaweens, Colonel Miles added*— “ I regret to say also that Syiul Toorkee and his brother have again become estrangetl, and that they are now so mutually distrustful of each other, that a sincere reconciliation between them appears somewhat difficult. “ Syud Abdool Azecz is displeased and annoyed with His Highness on account of the way in which he considers his brother has mismanaged affairs of late, and he is also piqued I believe at the fact of Ilis Highness not having consulted him on the subject of his resigna tion of power and departure from Muscat, and for not even informing him of his intention. “ His Highness Syud Toorkee, on the other hand, is imbued with the suspicion that Syud Abdool Azeez has been intriguing with the Bedaweens to subvert him (Syud Toorkee), and that he has instigated them in their proceedings. “ His Highness and Syud Abdool Azeez are both of a very jealous disposition and prone to evil suggestions from others. I am not aware that His Highness has any solid grounds for his suspicions of Abdool Azeez, and it is my opinion that he has behaved honestly and loyally towards his brother throughout.” + Vide his letter No. 762-191, dated Muscat, 20th July 1875. 427. On the 20th of July Colonel Boss arrived t in Muscat and found matters as reported by Colonel Miles. 428. On the following day the Besident l waited on His Highness Syud - From Colonel Ro», No. 768-193, Toorkee, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, dated Bunder Abbass, 24th July 1875. and Conversed with His HiglineSS On tllC Subject of the position of his affairs. His Highness seemed extremely depressed and despondent, and avowed that he was physically incapacitated from taking any part in active measures and had lost control over events. Colonel Boss asked His Highness whether he considered there was any danger of disturbances or disorders in Muscat at present; he replied—no, for the simple reason that all their demands had been conceded.98 429. The Resident next sounded His Highness as to whether he had formed any plans, or intended to adopt any special measures, in order to re establish his authority and regain a more dignified position. “It, wrote Colonel Ross, “ became painfully apparent that late worry and anxiety have induced a frame of mind which renders His Highness unable to consider his affairs with the calmness necessary for coming to any firm decision.” His Highness had however abandoned his intention of leaving Muscat; althouglThe had actually had his personal effects packed for that purpose. As the Sultan made no allusion to his proposed abdication the Resident refrained from making any remarks on the subject. 430. The Sultan whilst speaking with the Resident expressed a hope that the latter would intervene in the disputes between himself and the Omanee Bedaween Chiefs. Colonel Ross at once informed His Highness that it was im possible for him to interfere, as it would be contrary to his instructions. 431. Colonel Ross spoke*to His Highness regarding the estrangement between the brothers, and offered, if such were the wish of His Highness, to afford his good offices to smooth the way as far as possible to lestoie mutual confidence. At the same time Colonel Ross clearly explained to His Highness that it was by no means his intention to press this suggestion on His Highness, and it was entirely for his own consideration and decision whether he would again seek the assistance of Syud Abdool Azeez in carrying on the Govern- inent. The Resident further clearly informed the Sultan that he could not go beyond friendly mediation, and that he could not guarantee, oi be a party to, any conditions that might be eventually settled upon. His Highness having accepted the Resident’s offer, Colonel Ross saw Abdool Azeez, who expressed himself as being willing to assist His Highness, and said he was perfectly prepared to refute to His Highness the accusations vdiich seemed to have been made against him. Syud Abdool Azeez s statements seemed to Lieutenant- Colonel Miles and to Colonel Ross to be straightforward and satisfactory. 432. Colonel Ross then arranged that Syud Abdool Azeez should call on His Highness Syud Toorkee with Lieutenant-Colonel Miles and himself, where the tw r o brothers could discuss their affairs, and if so disposed, come to a mutual asrreement. “ This,” said the Resident, “ was effected, and having so far paved the way to an understanding, I considered I had done as much as the occasion demanded and my orders warranted, and took leave of His Highness. My returning to 'Biishire would I thought best show His Highness that no more active inter vention in his affairs was intended. « Captain Foot, Senior Naval Officer Commanding Her Majesty's Ship Daphne, having informed me that he was anxious on account of the health of his crew to proceed to Kurrachee, 1 told that officer that I considered one vessel would suffice to watch British interests at present at Muscat. Captain Foot has arranged for one vessel to remain there.” 433. Muscat threatened by Wahibehs. Orders of Govern ment on Syud Toorkee’s application for aid— On the 12th August the Resident telegraphed : — “ Referring to my No. 768-193, dated 24th July 1875, Political Agent, Muscat, reports on 5th August: Arrangement between Sultan and bis brother continued to show beneficial results, and matters so far improved at Muscat. Fresh apprehensions, however, arise from movements of another faction of A1 Wahibeh tiibe under Hameyed hin Khalifeen in threaten ing march on Muscat. Colonel Miles considers if this force reaches Muttra, Toorkee's position will be again endangered, as Muscat force inadequate. Sultan enquired of Political Agent whether in event of attack he would receive active support, urging he relied greatly on British Government, and trusted aid would not be withheld when he most needed it. Guided by my instructions based in your telegram of 16th July, Colonel Miles replied he had no discretion and could not resort to force without previous sanction. In refernng for orders Political Agent solicits sanction to support Toorkee in case of emergency, pointing out rapidity of events in Oman and absence of facility for corresponding rapid reference to Government, a fortnight or three weeks being sometimes required to obtain replies to telegrams: under which circum-stances necessity for reference in each case and under all circumstances would be almost tanta mount to refusal of support. I respectfully solicit telegraphic instructions on this reference as early as convenient.” The Government of India replied by telegram No. 2270P., dated 16th August 1875 :— “ If Toorkee asks formally in writing for active support, give it to him as before as far as guns of our vessels can reach. But armed assistance should not be volunteered nor given unless on occasion of any particular crisis it is formally asked for. If lives and property of British subjects are in danger, Colonel Miles may do what is necessary for their protection.' But he must bear in mind the general policy of not interfering in internal affairs of Oman if it can possibly be avoided, although good offices may freely he used.” 434. Further estrangement between Syud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez. Bedaweens threaten to attack Muscat. Syud Toorkee finally resolves on retiring to Gwadur. Abdool Azeez assumes management of Muscat Administration.—By telegram dated the 17th August, Colonel Ross reported :— “Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs as follows on 15th: Muscat, Ihth. —Toorkee and Abdool Azeez again estranged and Azeez withdrawn himself from affairs. Toorkee does not desire reconciliation or further association with him, and affairs have reached crisis. Bedaweens have deserted Toorkee’s cause. Toorkee has resolved to retire to Gwadur for present, leaving Azeez in charge. Has asked for Rifleman, and leaves in two days; cause of estrangement dispute about garrison Muscat forts.” Message ends. I have telegraphed Bombay return boat to Colonel Miles to confine action to protection of British interests. I am requesting Daphne, now at Kurrachee, to proceed as soon as possible to Muscat. I have informed Commissioner in Sind of Toorkee's intention of proceeding to Gwadur. * Telegram, No. 2298 P., dated the 435. The Resident’s instructions to the Political 20 th of August 1875. Agent were approved'' by the Government of India. 436. On the 21st of August, Colonel Ross again telegraphed : — “ Following message, dated Muscat, 17th, received from Political Agent: ‘Muscat, \ 7th. — On 15th Bedaweens threatened Toorkee that if Muscat fort guards not changed, they would attack him and plunder town. Toorkee immediately sent give up forts, and retired on board Rahmanee corvette, where he now is. Has since written to Abdool Azeez appointing him to act in his place. No disturbance or plundering occurred. Toorkee is anxious to hear reply of Government to my telegram of 15th before leaving. Azeez will probably assume religious rule; Metowwas Hocking in. Saleh bin Ali Gharibee expected. just returned from cruise. Your presence desirable/ Message ends. I am replying that reply to Political Agent’s message of 15th is approved by Viceroy of my instructions to confine action to protection of British interests; that I infer Government desire no interference with Toorkee’s pi-esent plans, and consider no objection to passage being afforded to His Highness if asked for and provided vessel can be safely spared. As regards Colonel Miles’ wishes for my presence at Muscat, I am prepared to proceed by next steamer, leaving 26th; but I should first wish to be informed if Government considers this advisable. If so, I trust I may be as fully as possible instructed as to the general objects towards which our influence should be directed. The Hugh Rose proceeded to Muscat on 17th, and I believe Daphne will leave Kurrachee to-day, so that protection of subjects and property is adequately provided for. Beyond close observation of affairs 1 could not at present suggest further measures.” 437. In reply! Government informed Colonel Ross that there was no t Telepram, No. 2327 P., dated 23 rd necessity for him togo to Muscat, and approved August 1875. of his instructions to Colonel Miles. 438. By telegram dated 24th August, Colonel Ross intimated :— “Political Agent telegraphs from Muscat on 21st: “Toorkee proceeding in Rifleman to-day. Abdool Azeez carrying on government steadily. + ’ r ‘ ' glls ‘ Quiet everywhere.’ Message ends. Toorkee landed at Gwadur last evening,! and is residing with Political Assistant.” 439. The Government of India then directed^ the Commissioner in Sind to see that Syud Toorkee was treated with every consideration in the event of his going to Kurrachee. Sir William Merewether promisedj| § Telegram, No. 2350P., dated 26th August 1875. || Telegram dated 26th August 1875. to act accordingly. 99 A A440. Syud Toorkee’s retirement reported to Secretary Of State. —By telegram No. 2382P., dated the 30th of August 1875, and by despatch No. 176P. of the 13th September, Her Majesty’s Government were informed of the circumstances which had led to the retirement of His Highness Syud Toorkee, and to the assumption by his brother Abdool Azeez of the administration of Muscat aftairs. 441. Conditions agreed to between Syud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez for the Government of Muscat. Disaffection of the Ghaffiree tribe.

The Sultan had also consented to the following agreement, givino- Abdool Azeez a considerable voice in the management of affairs :— “ From Syud Abdool Azeez bin Saeed. “ The two conditions I require from my brother Toorkee bin Saeed are— “ l-siJ.—That I shall be consulted and my advice followed in the expenditure of the customs and the revenues of Muscat in that— “ All payments, non-payments, increments and reductions of subsidies, salaries, &amp;c., be in accordance with my advice. “ That I be allowed to exercise my discretion in regulating the allowances to be iriven to the Governors of Fortresses, soldiers, and other servants of the Government. “ Znd. —That in all matters relating to politics my advice be followed, i.e .— “ If I consider anything detrimental to the well-being of the Government and require its discontinuance or withdrawal, it shall be done, as also, should I consider anything essential to the prosperity of the State, it shall likewise be granted. “ Agreed to the arrangement required by my brother, Abdool Azeez bin Saeed, and conceded. “ (Sd.) Toorkee bin Saeed. “ I am satisfied with the two clauses or terms conceded to me by my brother, Toorkee-bin- Saeed, and agree to stand by them. “ (Sd.) Abdool Azeez bin Saeed.” t Paragraph . . 443 ‘ After this ’ th ® Mothers for a time, as pre viously shown,t remained on good terms. 444. On the 5th August the difficulty experienced by His Hio-hness in carrying out the second of the conditions agreed upon between him and the A1 Wahibeh Bedaweens, viz., the removal of the Ghaffiree garrison of Semail in favor of a Belooch garrison, was still unremoved, Mahomed bin Senan having declined to surrender the fort except to His Highness in person. Abdool Azeez wished the Sultan to proceed thither accordingly to fulfil the condition but His Highness considered himself physically unfit for the journey, and did not appear to think his going at all necessary. Colonel Miles thought that the 100■I 4 J ! difficulty might be got over ia some other way. It was the general opinion that the Ghaffirees were disaffected at the ascendency of the Hinawees, and were much dissatisfied at the recent conditions imposed by the latter on His High ness Syud Toorkee. It was also reported that the Beni Bu Ali, El-Jenebeh, and other Ghaffiree tribes of Jalaan, had in view a project for bringing Syud Salim bin Thoweynee back to the country, and that they were raising funds for that purpose. 445. Colonel Miles, however, thought that the Sultan had more cause for apprehension in the movements of Sheikh Hameyed bin Khalifeen, of the A1 Wahibeh, whose rumoured intention to attack Muscat (paragraph 433) had been confirmed. This Chief being at variance with Hamood bin Said of the same tribe [the man who had exacted favorable terms from the Sultan,] (paragraphs 418-425), was much incensed at the success of his rival at Muscat, and at the advantageous position which he had secured. 446. Colonel Miles reported that Hameyed bin Khalifeen was leagued with Sheikh Nasir bin Salim bin el Habsi, and that if they succeeded in reach ing Muttra, the Sultan would find himself in an awkward position. Abdool Azeez and the Sheikhs at the time in Muscat had promised to support His Highness, but it was plain to all that the force in Muscat was much too small to cope with the number that Hameyed and Nasir could bring with them. 447. The Sultan having enquired of the Political Agent whether he would receive the support of Government in case of an attack on him, the telegraphic correspondence containing the orders of Government and comprised in paragraph 433 of this Precis then ensued. 448. In a subsequent letter, No. 346-126, dated 19th August* 1875, • From Political Resident, Persian Colonel Miles intimated that Hameyed had aban- Gulf, No. on-224, dated 25th August doned his intended attack on Muscat, though why he had done so was not known. 1875. 449. Measures taken by the Resident for the protection of British interests at Muscat.—When Syud Toorkee decided on retiring to Gwadur, the Resident, fearing that some confusion might arise at Muscat, on His Highness’ departure, asked Captain Fort of the Daphne to move from Kurrachee to Muscat. Colonel Ross also placed the Hugh Rose, the Residency Steamer, at the Political Agent’s disposal, so that he might + From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, not be 'Without a Vessel should the RijieiTiaH No. 873-217, dated 19th August 1875. have left with Syud Toorkee.f 450. Particulars of (1) the final estrangement between Syud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez; (2) the retirement of the Sul tan to Gwadur; (3) the assumption by Abdool Azeez of the Government of Muscat. Question of the continuance of the Zanzibar subsidy. —In his letter No. 346-126, dated 19th August 1875,1 J From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Colonel Miles reported that on the 10th of the No. 911 - 224 , dated 25 th August 1875. month a difference had arisen between the brothers about the guards in Forts Merani and Jelali which overlook the Muscat Harbour. Abdool Azeez having visited the forts and mustered the men had found a deficiency in the strength of the garrisons, there being only about twelve men in each instead of thirty, the number for which the Commandants had been in the habit of drawing pay and rations. Abdool Azeez insisted on the Command ants being dismissed and the guards being replaced by some of the Beni Bu Hassan. He urged this on the ground that Syud Toorkee had, in the recently executed agreement between them, transferred to him (Abdool Azeez) the control of the forts. The Sultan declined to accede to his brother’s demand saying that he was aware of the reduced strength of the guards, he however pro mised that the Commandants should be required to keep the garrisons up to 101 *'• »' fjtheir full strength. This arrangement not pleasing Abdool Azeez, he declared that if the conditions so recently agreed to by His Highness were not carried out, he would have nothing further to do with the Government and remain aloof. The Sultan then asked the Political Agent to mediate, but as Abdool Azeez held to his resolve, Colonel Miles could do nothing. The principal Sheikhs then at Muscat, for their part begged His Highness to comply with his brother’s wish. The Sultan however refused to yield and nothing was done. Colonel # a b j j Miles believed that Syud Toorkee was anxious to screen Rujab,* the Commandant of the Merani Fort, from the wrath of the Metowwa party. It is universally believed in Oman that Rujab is the murderer of El-Khaleelee. The Metowwa party had threatened to kill him, hence His Highness’ wish to keep him from their hands. 451. After this the Sultan endeavoured to carry on the administration unaided, and he entered into an arrangement with a party of El-Hijrieen who had just then arrived in Muscat to protect him, and to act as a check against the Bu Hassans, who, though “professedly faithful, were undoubtedly disatfected.” 452. The Sultan soon found that he had undertaken more than he could perform. He was unable to carr}^ on the Government unaided, and a serious rising of the Bedaweens having occurred he ordered the Commandants of Merani and Jelali to make over those forts to the . insurgents. His Highness then betook himself on board the corvette Rahmanee and finally decided on retiring to Gwadur leaving Abdool Azeez in charge of affairs. The Bedaweens having gained possession of the forts dispersed quietly without any attempt to molest people or to plunder property. 453. “ It is apparent,” wrote Colonel Miles, “ that His Highness Syud Toorkee's relinquishment of power for the present is the result of no sudden revolution, hut events have been tending in this direction for a lono- time past. It only required a movement on the part of the Bedaweens, who for some time have had all the real power in their hands to bring on a crisis, and when this occurred His Highness had no resource but to yield to circumstances. In accordance with the wishes of Government I have abstained as much as possible from interference and have not interrupted the course of events, but it is almost impossible in such position to stand aloof altogether, and I have confined myself to maintaining communication between His Highness and his brother and to smoothing difficulties between them. “ I have continued to assure His Highness Syud Toorkee that I felt bound to afford him personal protection for himself and family, and offered him the asylum of this Agency should he from apprehension of violence desire to avail of it. I have constantly visited and endeavoured to cheer him as much as possible since he has been on board the Rahamanee, but I have not visited Syud Abdool Azeez since he assumed charge of the Government. 454. Colonel Miles thought it probable that A.bdool Azeez would make friends with the religious party and surround himself with Metowwas, many of whom had already shown themselves in the town. Abdool Azeez was much embarrassed for want of funds as the Sultan had left an empty Treasury behind him. He (Abdool Azeez) had applied to the Political Agent for an advance of $5,000, the request was declined. Abdool Azeez also wrote to Colonel Ross informing him of his having assumed the reins of Government at Muscat • the Resident simply replied that he had every confidence that Abdool Azeez would take care that order was maintained, and that Colonel Miles would receive from him every assistance in matters concerning British interests. 455. Subsidy question. Toorkee’s allowance while at Gwadur. Before leaving Muscat the Sultan was anxious to ascertain the view taken by the Govern ment of India m regard to his position with reference principally to the conti nuance of the Zanzibar subsidy. Colonel Miles reported that he understood it to be His Highness’ intention, provided Government granted the favor to appro priate a certain portion for himself leaving the rest for his brother’s Government Syud Toorkee had already, when entrusting his financial arrangements to his brother, allotted to himself an allowance of $ 1,000 a month, and heliad requested his brother to continue this payment to him for the present. 102456. Extent of Abdool Azeez's jurisdiction .—On the 14th August Syud Toorkee informed Colonel Miles that his brother’s authority would extend to all parts of the country, hut not to Gwadur. Gwadur will be especially^ in my hands and the allowance I have appropriated for myself will continue to be paid to me.” 457. In forwarding Colonel Miles’ report the Political Resident trusted that the Political Agent’s proceedings, which seemed ~to have been “ proper and judicious throughout,” might meet with the approval of Government. 458. Syud Abdool Azeez’s Administration.— When Syud Abdool Azeez first assumed the management of the State he wrote to most of the influential people in Oman inviting them to Muscat. Amongst others he wrote to Saleh bin Ali and the Metowwa El- Gharibee, Colonel Miles heard* that the latter had declined the invitation. Neverthless Abdool Azeez prospered, for the latest intelligence forwarded! by the Political Agent reports that no alteration had occurred in the general position of aftairs, and that Syud Abdool Azeez’s authority seemed to be more widely acknowledged every * From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 911-224, dated 25tli August 1875. f From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 924-225, dated 31st August 1875. day. The Syud had entered into terms with the Beni Ghafir and other Ghaffiree tribes who had promised their submission, and the Sheikhs of those tribes had sent to Muscat for a safeguard of the Bu Hassan to conduct them to the town. Syud Abdool Azeez’s position had been further materially strengthened by the proceedings of Sheikh Khameyyis and a party of 200 of the Beni Bu Hassan who had been sent for by His Highness Syud Toorkee to support him and act as a check on the disaffected party in Muscat. On their arrival at the town these men and their Chiefs actuated thereto by the party m power joined Abdool Azeez’s standard without communicating with Syud Toorkee. 459. When Colonel Miles reported the above events the Sultan was on the eve of departure for Gwadur. Since His Highness had taken up his abode on the Bahmanee he had not been visited by Abdool Azeez, and very little com munication had taken place between the brothers. The Sultan had not mterfeied in any way in his brother’s policy and arrangements. 460. Syud Toorkee’s intention to return to Muscat— In x No. 924 - 225 , dated sist August his last letter} on the subject of the Muscat crisis 1875. Colonel Ross writes :— “His Highness Syud Toorkee expressed to Lieutenant-Colonel Miles his intention of return ing to Muscat if circumstances permitted. The situation is, however, in many respects a complicated one, and it would be premature to speculate on what may eventuate from Syud Toorkee’s move. I shall be careful to keep Government informed by telegraph of any occur rences of importance and to refer any serious question that may arise for orders. Foreign Departmemt, Simla, | 23rc?

Position of affairs at the beginning of August 1875: Retire ment of Sayyid Turki to Guadar. —In May 1874, Sayyid. Turki, ill in health, devoid of suitable advisers, and unable to control the turbulence or resist the rapacity of the Bedouin tribes, had invited his brother, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, then a political detenu at Karachi, to reside at Maskat, under certain conditions, and aid him in carrying on the Government. For a time the arrangement proved satisfactory and beneficial. Abdul Aziz loyally observ ed the conditions imposed upon him, and his more stable and energetic character strength to the Sultan’s councils and actions. Gradually, however, differences 'of opinion in regard to policy, Sayyid Turki’s addiction to low favourites, irritability on both sides, and jealousy and distrust on that of the Sultan, gave rise to a series of disputes, which ended early in August 1875, in Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s withdrawing from all participation in the conduct of affairs. Sayyid Turki then tried to carry on the Government without aid or advice, but a threatened rising of the Bedouin garrison of Maskat, conse quent on a promise made to them regarding custody of the forts not being fulfilled, caused him to take refuge on board his corvette the Uahmani, and to decide on retiring to Guadar. Having appointed Sayyid Abdul Aziz to act as regent during his absence, with jurisdiction over all the territories appertain ing to Maskat except Guadar, he proceeded thither on 21st August, on hoard H. M. S. Biflemcm, his family followeePin his corvette the Bahmani. When leaving Maskat he expressed to the Political Agent, Colonel Miles, his intention to return, should circumstances permit. Throughout these occurren ces Colonel Miles’s attitude had been marked by great consideration and sym- nathv for Sayyid Turki, while calculated to discourage ambitious views on • the part of Sayyid Abdul Aziz. The Political Agent’s proceedings during Sayyid Turki’s with- 6th October 1875. ^ drawal and Sayyid Abdul Aziz s assumption ol Poll. A., November 1875, Nos. 61 - 87 . au ^j 10r ^y &gt; were approved by Government. 462. At this time Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee, ex-Sultan of Maskat, was livin' at Kishm, in the Persian Gulf, on an allowance of dollars 150 per men sem 'from Sayyid Turki. Ibrahim bin Kais, on outwardly friendly terms with Sayyid Turki, was residing at Rostak. 463—Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s administration—Sayyid Abdul Aziz, on assuming charge of affairs, made efforts to restore order, and on 21st August the Political Agent reported that his authority appeared to be more widely acknowledged every day. In the want of ready money he had, however, an immediate^ and menacing difficulty, Sayyid Turki having left the treasury empty and the turbulent Bedouin garrison’s pay in From Resident Persian Gulf to a s applied to the Political Agent for a dated 25th August 1875. loan of dollars 5,000, but was informed that the Foil, a., November 1875, Nos ei-87. re q Ues fc CO uld not be entertained. On 2nd Septem ber, Colonel Miles reported that— « Sayyid Abdul Aziz has continued to carry on the Government quietly, and no risings or ^ disturbances in the interior have been reported. The Shaikhs From Resident, p er« a ° Gulf, to Go. ^ l ea ding men of most of the Hinawi and some of the Ghafiri SXptlw 1876 tribes of ’Oman and El Shark!, eh have arrived in Maskat by Poll.

Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s chief difficulty continued to he want of funds wherewith to satisfy the claims of the Bedouins garrisoning Maskat, who106 numbered 600 or 700, and were all powerful. He expressed to the Political Agent fears that the Bedouins, if not paid, might mutiny and create disturbance, and again hinted a hope that pecuniary aid might be given him. Colonel Miles replied that a loan was out of the question, and remarked that if any From uesid-nt, Persian Ouif, to Co- disturbance occurred he sliould take steps, in concert ioTSptembLr d i 875 °' 950 * 2j1 ’ di,UHl with the commanders of H.M.’s vessels, to protect Poll, a., March 1876, Nos. 97-156. British interests. 465. On 1st September Shaikh Salih bin Ali El Harthi arrived at Maskat Pl .„ „ ., . „ . n , . with 400 or 500 followers, and was received by From Hesident, Persian Gulf, to'»ov- • j *i i a • . / ernment of India, No. 950-231, dated ^ayyid Abdul AZIZ With mUCIl consideration. His Nos. 97 . 156 . '‘l; 1 '. 80 uu '' le !' ous a suite &gt; raisi “S the num- her ot lighting men in Maskat to 1,2(&gt;0, increased the pecuniary pressure. With much difficulty Sayyid Abdul Aziz succeeded From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- in raising dollars 4,000 or 5,000, wherewith he 1018 - 24 '’ d “ ei paid off and got rid of most of the Bedouins in Poll, a., March 1876, Nos. 97-156. attendance on their Shaikhs at Maskat. 466.

If he adopted any other course, or declined to be guided by their views, Shaikh Salih was at liberty to depart from Maskat and act as he pleased. The influential position thus acquired by Salih bin Ali caused some iealousy among other partisans of Sayyid Abdul Aziz. o ; o p 467. Shaikh Salih, shortly after his arrival, paid two visits to the Political Agent, and, under pretext of asking advice, tried to sound him as to the pro bability of Sayyid Turki’s returning to Maskat. Colonel Miles declined to express any opinion on that point. Immediately after Shaikli Salih’s second visit, Colonel Miles received a message from Sayyid Abdul Aziz that the diffi culties of his position were such that he did not desire to carry on the gov ernment any longer, and he asked for advice as to what he should do. In reply Colonel Miles reminded him of the responsibility he had incurred in un dertaking the regency, and declined io discuss the subject. From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- errment of India, No. 1018-241, dated 24th September 1875. Poll. A., March 1876, Nos. 97-156. 468. It now became apparent that Sayyid Abdul Aziz, urged by Shaikh Salih bin Ali, aimed at the assumption of independent power. On 16th September Colonel Miles wrote :— “ I should not he at all surprised auy day to hear that he had proclaimed himself inde pendent of his brother.” 469.

The Beni Bu Ali repaired their forts and took measures to defend their quarter of Soor if attacked. In the west, Sayyid Badar bin Saif, Wali of Sohar, prepared to resist if interfered with] and gained the adherence of the Naeem of El Bereymi. Sayyid Abdul Aziz expressed an intention of proceeding to Soor to coerce the Beni Bu Ali and asked the Political Agent if a passage thither in one of Her Majesty’s vessels might he afforded him. Colonel Miles replied that his request could not he complied without the special sanction of Government.107 470.

In reply, Colonel Miles informed him that the only ground on which he could yenture to submit such a request to Government, would be an appli cation from Sayyid Turki for an advance of the Zanzibar subsidy. The Resident approved this reply, and, in answer to the application addressed to himself, intimated to Sayyid Abdul Aziz that, while fully concurring in Colonel Miles’s view, he'‘would submit the application for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council. In forwarding Colonel Miles’ report of recent occur rences on 24th September, the Resident begged to know whether the action taken had the approval of Government, and solicited instructions for his and the Political Agent’s guidance in the event of Sayyid Abdul Aziz assuming independent authority. In reply Colonel Ross was informed that his pro ceedings, and those of Colonel Miles were approved, and instructed that if Sayyid Abdul Aziz declared himself independent, the Political Agent should abstain from interference, and report fully for the information and orders of Government.

On 1st October the Political Agent reported that the feelings of r,om Resident, Persian o„if. to j ealolls .y ai ; d hostility towards Shaikh Salih bin Ali, Government of India, No. 1091-258, entertained by some of the other Shaikhs who com- &lt; 1 *li 1 a!M 0 «rd^ 876 , 7 No. 97 . 156 . P osed Sa yy id Abdul Aziz’s entourage, had become more marked. The country continued tranquil, and no opposition to the rule of Sayyid Abdul Aziz had occurred anywhere. It appeared to Colonel Miles that Sayyid Abdul Aziz waited for some indication on the part of Government of the view taken of his position before proclaiming Prom Resident, Per,i»n o,if, to lumseH Sultan, and that the inactivity of aU parties Government of India, No. 1134 - 268 , might be ascribed to a feeling of suspense. The A 0 ;,Ss^No^ 97 . 156 . ascendancy of the Mutowwa party was on the increase in Maskat. On 6th October Shaikh Salih bin Ali left for El Sharkiyak with the view of protecting Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s interests in that quarter. 472. On 26th September Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee crossed in a native Precis, paragraph 447 . boat trom Kishin to the Batinah coast, and was proceeding to Maskat, when, at the Political Agent’s request, H.M.S. Daphne arrested him on 11th October off Sowadi island. By direction of the Resident he was taken on Board H.M.S. Daphne to Karachi, there made over to the Commissioner in Sind, and imprisoned in the fort at Hyderabad. Sayyid Harib, Salim’s brother, who had accompanied and was arrested with him, was set at liberty and sent back to Kishm.

The Chief of Abu Dhabi, Shaikh Zaid bin Khalifah, visited Sayyid Abdul Aziz from 30th Sep tember to 24th October, and entered into a friendly compact to support Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s interests as far as possible. He departed with a present efr dollars 4,000, the entire cost of his visit having amounted to some dollars 6,000. 474. On 12th November the Political Agent reported that the A1 Wahibah and El Haboos, Bedouin tribes of El Sharkiyah, had arranged an expedition in force against Mas kat, for the purpose of removing Sayyid Abdul Aziz and recalling Sayyid Turki, but that the threatened From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No 1234-289, dated a 9th November 1875. Poll. A., March 1876, Nos. 97-156.108 invasion liad been averted by the efforts of febaikli Salib bin Ali. Colonel Miles requested instructions as to whether, in the event of a sudden attack being made by Bedouins on Maskat, the same armed assistance should be accorded to Sayyid Abdul Aziz, while governing for Sayyid Turki, as would be given to Sayyid Turki himself under similar circumstances. The orders of Government in reply were as follows :— « Government, as you have been already instructed, wish to avoid interference in the in- ‘ . ternal affairs of Maskat, and Political Agent must be guided ReliZt, a ~'L°t by this policy. At the same time, if Sayyid Abdul Aziz, in dated 16th November 1875. Sayyid Turki’s name, prefers written request tor help in Poll.

On 13th December Sayyid Turki arrived unexpectedly at Mattrah, having crossed from Guadar in a native For details see precis, paragraphs 451 qq ie ^ ra |) anc [ Belooch guards of Mattrah submitted to him forthwith, and he occupied the citadel; but Sayyid Muhammed bin Azan and the Beni Bu Hassan garrison of Maskat refused to yield the place, or admit him, without orders from Sayyid Abdul Aziz. Sayyid Turki thereupon declared Sayyid Abdul Aziz deposed, but the Governor and garrison, uninfluenced by this, maintained their atti tude. On hearing of Sayyid Turki’s arrival and proceedings, Sayyid Abdul Aziz wrote from Semail to Sayyid Muhammad bin Azan that he was about to return to Maskat with as many men as he could collect, and had sent notice to Shaikh Salih bin Ali to join him. On the 19th December Sayyid Turki, having been joined at Mattrah by 200 or 300 Arabs of neighbouring Ghafiri tribes, and some 50 Wahabi soldiers, sent by the Wali of Sohar, occupied the suburbs and heights outside the walls of Maskat. A desultory and harmless fire was carried on between his forces and the garrison for two days, after which Sayyid Abdul Aziz not appearing, and the attacking party threatening more active measures, the garrison agreed to capitulate. Sayyid Turki entered Maskat on the 21st December amid general and hearty demon strations of joy at his return. Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s adherents, including Shaikh Salih bin Ali, at once abandoned him. His efforts to raise a force entirely failed, and he remained almost alone in the fort of Semail. 477. Arrest of Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee by H. M. S. “ Daphne His imprisonment at Hyderabad. —When, in September 1873, Sayyid Salim, then at Gwadar, refused a monthly allowance of dollars 300 offered him by Sayyid Turki through See precis, para. 255.109 Government, on condition that he should reside in India, the Commissioner in Sind was directed, on 5th November 1873, to inform him:— “ That His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council declines to negotiate any terms with him, or with His High less Sayyid Turin regarding him, except those of which lie has been already informed; that if he comes into Gwadar or Karachi and gives himself up unconditionally, he will be granted the same provision as Abdul Aziz ; but that if he does not comply within such time as you may direct, the terms will not be renewed, but he will be made a prisoner wherever found, and will then receive only such terms as may be thought fit, which will not be so favourable as those now offered.” On measures being taken to arrest him, he escaped to Bandar Abbas and thence to Kishm, where he continued to reside. Sayyid Turki, after a time, allowed him and his brothers, who joined him, dollars 150 monthly. In Janu ary 1875, Sayyid Turki expressed to Colonel Miles fears that Sayyid Salim would try to cross to the pirate coast or Soor, having been invited by the Ghafiri tribes of Oman. Colonel Ross inquired if Government would wish en deavours made to prevent Sayyid Salim crossing to Oman or to arrest him if found at sea. In reply he was referred to the orders of 5th November 1873. Telegram from Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, dated 30th September 1875. Poll. A., April 1876, Nos. 38-93. 478. On 29th September the Assistant Sur- geoit, in charge at Bassidore, telegraphed to the Resident:— “ Sayyid Salim left in Shaikh Sakar’s Bukarah, Nakhoda Saraki, for Arab coast, on 26th instant.” The Resident communicated this intelligence to Government, Sayyid Tur ki, and the Political Agent, Maskat, desiring the latter to inform the Senior Naval Officer and Sayyid Abdul Aziz. On 4th October Colonel Miles^ tele graphed to the Resident that information had reached Sayyid Abdul Aziz the day before that Sayyid Salim’s destination was Soor, and that the matter not admitting of delay, he had requested the Commander of II.M.S. Daphne to proceed to Soor and intercept him. He added that Sayyid Abdul Aziz had not stopped Sayyid Salim’s allowance, but had declined to inciease it. Daphne obtained no ne^vs of Sayyid Salim at Soor, and finding the Mali strong enough to arrest him if he arrived, returned to Maskat. On 12th Octo ber Colonel Miles telegraphed as follows :— tl Information received from Burka on 10th that Salim was moving down Batinah coast and had reached Sowadi. Daphne proceeded thither at once and arrested Salim with two vessels and forty men same night off Sowadi on his way attack Burka. Daphne returned yesterday.

In his supplementary report, Colonel Miles wrote: t X visited His Highness Sayyid Salim on arrival and informed him that, as he had thought fit to re-visit 'Oman for the purpose of raising dissen sions in the country, in spite of the warning he had received from Government, it was my duty to arrest him and detain t,j m on board until the instructions of Government had been received but that he was at liberty to dismiss his men and the Baghlas if he pleased. His Highness Sayyid Salim observed that his intention was not to excite dissension in the country, nor'to oppose the rule of Savyid Abdul Aziz, but that, as Sayyid Turki had left Maskat, he was in doubt whether he should receive any pension now and he merely wished to procure an arrangement as to this matter through the intervention of Zaid bin Khalifah and other friends in Maskat. He added that he had not received any pension since Sayyid Turki left, but then he admitted that the first instalment had not yet fallen due. I have learnt since his arrival that Sayyid Salim’s intention was not to attack Burka but to come straight on Maskat He had received letters from many people in ’Oman, and had been invited to Maskat, I believe by Shaikh Amir of the Beni Bu Hasan, who had promised he should find n° resistance ibis Shaikh Amir is the man who most strongly supported and encouraged Sayyid Abbul Aziz at the time of Sayyid Turki’s departure from Maskat. Sayyid Salim had arranged to land at Hail,where camels had been provided for him by the Moalik tribe the night on which he was captured, and it, is considered by well-informed persons that lie would have had a good chance if lie had escaped arrest and appeared before the walls of Maskat.” 479. Colonel Iloss inquired of the Commissioner in Sind if he had any objections to Sayyid Salim beiug taken to Karachi, «• mnent of*indi^ NofZ' 1146 *- 27 o^°dated and if arrangements could be made for his safe 22 nd October 1875. ^ custody. The Commissioner replied that there Poll, a., Apni 1876, Nos. 38-93. W ere no objections, and that Salim could be placed either in the jail at Karachi or the port at Hyderabad. At Colonel floss’s re quest, Captain Foot, of H.M.S. Daphne, accordingly conveyed Snyyid Salim to Karachi and made him over to the Commissioner. He was confined in the fort at Hyderabad. In reporting the capture to Government, Colonel Koss stated that he would communicate with Sayyid Turki regarding an allowance for Sayyid Salim’s maintenance. The result of eminent of India, Nos. 1163 - 273 , dated the communication was that Sayyid Turki agreed 30 th October 1875 .^ to allow dollars 100 a month, but suggested that Poll, a., April 18 / 6 , Nos. 38-93. the parricide should rather be made over to him, to be dealt with for his father’s murder. In reply Colonel Koss informed him that his views in regard to Saj yid Salim’s allowance should be communicated to Government. But that his proposal to receive Sayyid Salim could not be acceded to, as it would be quite opposed to tbe practice of the British Government in such cases. Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee, Salim’s brother, who had been arrest ed with him, was released by order of the Resident. Government signified approval of the measures taken in connection with Sayyid Salim's arrest by the Resident and Political Agent, and His Excellency dent, Persian Guir, No. 79 p„ dated the (Jommander-in-Chiet ot Her Majesty s naval 10 th January 1876. forces in the East Indies was requested to convey Poll.

With regard to the nature of Sayyid Salim’s confinement the orders of Government were:— u It is not the intention of the Government of India that Sayyid Salim should be subjected to an undue degree of personal restraint, but that be should be so dealt with as to prevent his escaping or carrying on intrigues.

No provision made here for Turkics expenses and none contemplated, apparently, revenue being insufficient expendi ture. Turki left Maskat without taking money or leaving any far Abdul Aziz. I think advance of subsidy would probably influence course of events, accordiiiir to ol&gt;ject for which required by Turki. It might enable him return Maskat if he purposes doing so.

Poll. A , Mnrch 1876, Nos. 97-156. On 7th December the Assistant Political Agent, Gwadar, reported :— Turki intends leaving for Maskat, I believe, immediately. Am sending boat to Miles from Jask.” And on 8th— “ Sayyid Turki just left in native boat.” Sayyid Turki’s corvette, the Rahmani, had been sent to Bombay for sale, and he was accompanied by his slaves only. Notice of Sayyid Turki’s departure for Maskat, sent by the Assistant Political Agent, Gwadar, by boat from Jask, and by the Resident by telegram to Karachi and thence by mail steamer, did not reach Colonel Miles until after Sayyid Turki’s arrival at Mattrah. On 16th December Colonel Miles telegraphed to the Resident:— ** Turki unexpectedly arrived Mattrah night of Iflth, and occupied town and forts without opposition. Arab and Belooch guards submitting at once. Governor has been imprisoned and fort walls being repaired. Moekler’s telegram reached me twelve hours after Turki's arrival. Abdul Aziz had left for Semail three days before in ignorance of Turki's ap proach Maskat in charge of Muharnmed Azan and about sixty Bu Hasan, who have refused to yield the place or admit Turki without orders from Abdul Aziz. Turki has thrice called on them to submit, but unsuccessfully. Turki next morning sent for my gig to enter Maskat, but I avoided compliance. He has since written informing me he has deposed Sayyid112 Abdul Aziz for being unfaithful, and requested me to prevent Arabs entering Maskat by sea. In reply I have said prior reference for orders would be necessary, and I have counselled him to avoid precipitation with regard to his brother. Turki has despatched letters to all his friends, and has been joined by Hamood-Al Wahibeh with thirty men. Believe that had Turki arrived during presence of Aziz he would have been amicably and properly received at Maskat. Am hopeful of amicable adjustment, but Aziz’s non-return not encouraging. He is probably deterred by Turki’s attitude. His present position and intention unknown. If possible, shall endeavour effect reconcilation, but if this impracticable, snail, pending in structions, remain neutral and confine myself to protection British interests.” Colonel Hoss replied: — “ X approve your proceedings reported, and of your remaining neutral pending orders of Government, and confining action to protection of British interest. ’ On the 21st Colonel Miles further reported by telegraph:— “On 19th Turki occupied heights and towers outside Maskat, and intimated his intention attack town that evening. I objected until arrangements made about British subjects, and Turki postponed attack till next night. Property banians removed on board baqh- lahs yesterday. Firing continued two days, but loss on either side very slight. Last night garrison resolved surrender, and preliminary negociations took place, which were completed this morning, and Turki entered town to-day with his troops. Forts Merani and Jelali are to hold out for ten days and then yield. Both parties have conducted themselves well. No injury to British subject.

Improper use of the British flag by Sayyid Turki’s adherents- —The letter which Sayyid Turki addressed to the Political Agent on the 18th, intimating his intention to attack Maskat on the following day, was conveyed from Mattrah in a boat flying the British flag, and containing several armed Arabs. On passing the forts commanding Maskat Harbour it was fired upon. Colonel Miles requested an explanation and satisfaction from the Governor Sayyid Muhammed bin Azan, who wrote him an apology and sent the Bedouin Shaikhs in charge of the forts to answer for themselves. They explained that their people had imagined that the armed men in the boat were part of Sayyid Turki’s force advancing to the attack.

The per- ernment of India, Nos. 455-88, dated son deputed by me found the boat, and, without my know- 1876.

I regret exceedingly that what has happened should have met with the disapprobation of Government, and can only express a hope of their forgiveness for the act.”113 'loo' 486. Sayyid Turki’s resumption of the Government: Attitudes of Sayyid Turki, and Sayyid Abdul Aziz, towards each other: Sayyid Turki S internal policy* —On 24th December Sayyid Turki wrote to the Resident:— “ llilve ar dved in our country, Maskat, after taking complete possession of Mattrah.

We delayed for no other reason than to collect men, so that we might meet our enemies, for I perceive that this is necessary. You are suffi cient to cope with him; be confident and contend with him. Protect your trust aud keen it secure.” ^ On 24th December, Colonel Miles reported : — “His Highness, Sayyid Turki, has appointed Sayyid Saeed bin Muhammad, the brother of his former minister, Thowamee, to be his Wazir, and has also taken Sayvid Muhammad bin Azan, tlie late Governor, back into favour, but he has not vet appointed the latter to anv post. The policy apparently adopted by His Highness Sayyid Turki is one of conciliation towards all parties, and he seems desirous, as before, to obtain the good-will of all 1 received a visit this morning from Sayyid Saeed, who brought me a letter His Hio-hness Sayvid Turki had just received from Sayyid Nasir bin Muhammad at Semail, stating that Sayvid Abdul Aziz was still in the fort at Semail with but very few followers left, and that he was desti tute of funds and quite at a loss how to act. Sayyid Saeed intimated that His Highness Sayyid Turki was anxious to know how I would recommend him to deal with his brother and whether I would mediate between them, in view to Sayyid Abdul Aziz accepting a pension to reside in India, or elsewhere out of ’Oman. I replied that His Highness Savyid Turki must be the best judge of how to deal with his brother, and that he would excuse'' my living anv opunou in the matter, but that I was quite ready to use good offices in bringino- about a friendly arrangement between His Highness and his brother, if both were ready to 'accept mv mediation, aud with the understanding that any arrangement should receive the approval of Government prior to its being carried out.” 1 ^ On 30tk December Colonel Ross telegraphed to Government: — “ Advices received from Maskat to 24th. All forts of Maskat submitted to Turki without further opposition. Abdul Aziz at Semail: Ins plans unknown. Turki requested Political Agent to prevent Abdul Aziz coming to Maskat by sea. Agent replied instructions precluded interference, being guided by instructions of your telegram 8th June 1872, to Government of Bombay, further reconciliation between Sultan aud brother being now out of question. IX . r 1 t trust Government will approve friendly mediation in view of inducing Abdul Aziz to accept pension from Turki and withdraw from country.

Country quiet.” And on 12th :— “ Abdul Aziz still with Salih. No signs of moving.” 487. Payment of Zanzibar subsidy made quarterly instead of half- yearly. — In a letter to Colonel Ross, dated 9th January 1876, Sayyid Turki, ^ ’ after adverting to the large expenditure which was a necessity of his position, requested that the Zanzibar subsidy might he paid to him in quarter ly instead of half-yearly instalments. This re quest, being supported by the Political Agent and Resident, was acceded to by Government on 28th February 1876, with effect from the following April.

Negociation for an arrangement between Sayyid Tnrki and ^ —, ., . . n „ , Sayyid Abdul Aziz.—On 21st January 1876, Gm’eriunent^f Tndia, 5T 85 -ielated Colonel Miles reported that Sayyid Abdul Aziz 29 th January 1876. i iac [ taken up his residence at Semail, where his Poll. A., April 1876, Nos. 107-13o. j? i • i. r* -i j i means of subsistence were confined to the bazaar dues, amounting to about dollars 100 monthly. Shaikh Salih bin Ali had accompanied him to Semail and then returned to Kabil, whence he wrote to Sayyid Turki, proposing, on behalf of Sayyid Abdul Aziz, that he should receive from Sayyid Turki an allowance of dollars 500 monthly, retain posses sion of Semail Port with some other on the Batinah coast, and he furnished with a supply of money for immediate expenses. Sayyid Turki declined this proposal, and intimated that an indispensable condition of any arrangement would be that Sayyid Abdul Aziz should quit the country. 489. Sayyid Turki contemplated renewing his old alliance with the Ghafiris and severing his recent intimate relations with the Hinawis, which had not proved advantageous to him; but while the Hinawi garrison held Semail Fort for his brother, he did not venture to take overt steps in this direction. He sent the Chiefs of the Beni Bn Hasan contingent at Maskat to negociate with Shaikh Hasan of the Beni Ruweyeh for the surrender of the fort, but they returned unsuccessful. He then ordered the neighbouring Ghafiri tribes to gain possession of it by force, and sent them an 18-pounder brass gun to assist their operations. Some fighting ensued between the Ghafiri and Hinawi tribes in the vicinity of the fort, wherein the latter were worsted with considerable loss. An attempt to storm the fort was about to he made, when the garrison received orders from Sayyid Abdul Aziz to surrender it, as the terms of a peaceful settlement between himself and his brother were being discussed. The Beni Ruweyeh thereupon evacuated the fort, and a Belueh garrison, sent by Sayyid Turki from Maskat, was placed in charge of it. 114115 490. On 18th February Colonel Miles reported :— “ I have to-day received a letter from His Highness Sayyid Ahdul Aziz, expressing a desire for mediation in the estrangement between himself and Sayyid Turki, and hinting that, in the event o£ my refraining from interference, he shall (eel himself at liberty to oppose his brother.” Colonel Uoss replied as follows :— “ If request made for mediation between Sultan and brother, confine replies to expression of friendly wishes to see differences arranged by mutual agreement of principals themselves, who best know their feelings, relations, and interests. It is desired they should settle their quarrels without our intervention. Moderation and the mutual concessions so desirable to interests of all concerned might be recommended in general terms. Avoid any intimations conveying impression that Government is uninterested or not tree to adopt any course con sidered expedient in its interests as occasion demands.” From Govermpent of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, (telesrrnm) J»o. 617 P., dated 6th March 1876.

On 29th February Colonel Miles telegraphed : — Badar has returned after communicating with Aziz through Salih bin Ali. Aziz I s willing to retire India on pension, but no definite terms arranged, Aziz desiring mediation only of British Government. Letter received by me from him, purport as follows : ‘ Badar bin Saif sent by brother arrived, but could not consult him regarding my affairs, since 1 had already asked intervention of Government between us, and could not agree to any terms except through mediation of British Government, and whatever terms you consider tit I am readv to accept. I wish to meet you at any place convenient to you that this may he settled.' Letter ends. Turki has personally requested me to mediate, and says difficulty will he prolonged indefinitely if Government do not acquiesce favourably. He also considers danger to peace of country if speedy settlement not effected, and states presence of Aziz causing him ruinous expense and anxiety. Please instruct whether and how far intervention may be given, and whether passage may be afforded in man-of-war if required.” Colonel Boss replied :— u Instructions against interference must be hel 1 to, hut you may afford good offices to facilitate amicaMe settlement at discretion, so far as consistent with those orders. For instance I see no objection to yaur being medium of communicating terms offered by either i arty, on distinct understanding that such terms are not dictated or officially unzed by you, and that no guarantee is given or implied on part of Government. Grant passage in man-of-war, if asked by Abdul Aziz after peaceable arrangement. Am transmitting your message to Government.

Aziz in reply required further guarantee safety to coast from Turki through me. At Turki’s written request, I wrote Aziz giving Turki's guarantee to Kurryat, and if necessary Wk to Semed. Aziz accepted assurance and appointed meeting 17th. It was inferred by Sultan from this that Aziz inclined accept proposed terms. I accordingly proceeded in Nimble ow. 19th with Wazir Saul Muhammad, who was lully em powered treat. Aziz arrived Kurryat 20th, having been detained by rain. He objected to see or treat with Wazir, on which 1 communicated to him Turki's proposed arrangement &lt;d residence in India on pension dollars 500. Aziz declared intention not leaving Oman, but required residence in country. Wazir considered condition leaving 'Oman indispensable. This closed negociatiou, and Aziz has returned Semed. I returned yesterday.' The failure of this attempt to come to an understanding with his brother was an unexpected and severe disappointment to Sayyid Turki. On the 14th April Colonel Miles further reported :— “ Shaikh Salih informs Turki that Abdul Aziz ready accept allowance dollars 500 to reside India on condition (government become medium payment. Turki anxious Aziz should quit ’Oman, and solicits consent Government to Aziz’s allowance being deducted from subsidy, and paid him so long as he remains India.’’ Government acceded to Sayyid Turki’s request in the following telegram to the Resident: — “ If Abdul Aziz promises not to leave India without permission, nor to intrigue thence against Turki, you can arrange for his removal, as proposed. In that case telegraph, inform ing Bombay and Commissioner, Sind.’’ Sayyid Turki, in expressing his thanks for the favour accorded, informed Colonel Miles on 28th April that he daily expected a reply to a letter he had written to Shaikh Salih bin Ali, and thought it better to take no further action until it arrived. \\ ^92.

He failed to obtain either object, and returned after a time to Semed. No further attempt to induce him to reside in India was made at that time. 494. Appeal of Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee to Sayyid Turki to obtain Ms release from detention in Hyderabad Fort.— On 31st March 1876, Colonel Miles forwarded for Resident’s in formation copy of a letter which Sayyid Salih ad dressed to Sayyid lurki, characterizing his con dition as a State prisoner in Hyderabad Fort as From Residont, Persian Gulf, to Go* vernment of India, No. 341-64, dated 7tli April 1876.

Sayyid Salim wrote that bis mother, who bore the letter, would furnish any security for his future good conduct that might be required. Colonel Miles reported that tlm mother had arrived, and been in communication with Sayyid Turki regarding her son’s liberation. 495. In the course of a conversation with the Political Agent, the Minis ter, Sayyid Saeed bin Muhammad, asked him whether he thought that Govern ment would be pleased to liberate Sayyid Salim, it a request to that effect were made by Sayyid Turki. Colonel Miles replied that — he believed Government would have no objection whatever to release His Highness Sayyid Salim from his present position, should His Highness Sayyid lurki specially icquestit; but that His Highness Savyid Turki would do well to bear in mind the ciicumstances under which Government had acted in this matter, and that, in the event of Sayyid Salim being set at liberty now, at His Highness's request, Government would probably not feel inclined to interfere again in a similar manner, should Sayyid Salim's proceeding at any future time be calculated to cause His Highness anxiety or apprehension.' With reference to the opinion expressed by Colonel Miles, Colonel Iloss wrote to him : — “ I would point out that the arrest and detention of Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee was not merely in consequence of his recent attempt to land near Maskat, nor solely to protect His Highness Sayyid Turki's interest, but resulted from his having conducted himself in an illegal and defiant manner as regards the Government of India. Therefore, although any solicitations Sayyid Turki may make on behalf of his nephew will doubtless have full consideration, I am not prepared to recommend Government to accede to a request tor Salim s release. I ke letter written by Sayyid Salim to His Highness is so obviously insincere that it is surprising Sayyid Turki should be moved by it.'

Lieutenant-Colonel Miles should be cautioned against expressing his opinion as to the policy of Government of India on a point regarding which he has received no instructions.' 496.

These were Amir bin Salim and ftashid bin Jumeeaof the Bu Hasan, and Hamood bin Saeed el Jahafi of the Al Wabibeh. The two former were arrested at the instigation of certain influential members of their own tiibe, w ho regarded their conduct as compromising the tribe generally. 1 he third, Hamood el Jahafi, had been incessantly engaged in intrigue for some years, and bad extoited con siderable sums of money from Sayyid Turki for allaying agitations which he had himself excited. On account of his extreme cunning, this man was deemed more dangerous than the others. 497. At the Sultan’s request Colonel Miles recovered and handed over to him certain sums of money belonging to the prisoners, aggregating dollars 3,263, which were in the hands of British subjects at Maskat. 498. On 14th April Colonel Miles telegraphed “ Turki poliets sanction of Government to Hamood hin Saeed, Shaikh al Wahibeh, being confined in Karachi Jail, as Turki is apprehensive of intrigues and efforts release Hamood if latter remain Maskat.

In submitting this application to Government, Captain Prideaux remarked that he did not con sider that suificient grounds for Shaikh Hamood’s Colonel Miles reported that Shaikh Mansur and Humaid bin Khalifeen, of the A1 Wahibeh, had arrived at Maskat to intercede for Shaikh Ilamood ; they privately informed Sayyid Turki that had Hamood been put to death at once, it would have pleased them, but as this had not been done, it was now incumbent on them to intervene and protect the honour of the tribe. 499.

A few days later, however, he yielded to the pressure and threats of the tribes, backed by Shaikh Salih bin AH, and, on 2nd July, the three Shaikhs were released and permitted to return to their country. Regarding their release, Colonel Miles wrote :— “ It is, of course, impossible to foretell what may he the result of this step on His Highness’s part, but it is not generally viewed with favour in Maskat. The Minister, Sayyid Saeed however, is not apprehensive of future troubles arising from the machinations of these men, and informed me that, in Ins opinion, His Highness had, under the circumstances, no other course open to him to pursue.” 502.

Dr. Kirk, after due inquiry, reported that the sum due to Sayyid Abdul Aziz from his deceased brothers and sisters estates was trifling, and gave it as his opinion that the question, for this and other reasons, was not one to enter into. Government held that interfer ence was uncalled for. 505. Intrigues of the Beni Ruweyeh garrison of Burka Fort with Sawid Ibrahim bin Kais —On 6th May 1876, Colonel Miles reported that Sayyid Turki had suddenly left by sea for Burka, JrJirMto' Sis? in consequence of intelligence that the Wali and dated 12th May 1876 . Garrison were in communication with Sayyid Poll. A., July 1875, Nos. i-oo. Ibrahim bin Kais, with a view to put the fort into his possession. The chief forts on the Batinah coast, with the exception of Sohar, were at this time in charge of the Beni Ruweyeh tribe. The Sultan had been aware for some time that the Wali of Burka, Hamood bin Saif, and Sayyid Ibrahim were in correspondence, hut he had no suspicion that their communications were of a seditious character.

Had Sayyid Turki not acted with promptitude and vigour on this occasion, it is probable that he would have lost both Burka and Suwaik. The Wali and garrison of Suwaik were left in charge until a more fitting season, although their disaffec tion was well known to the Sultan. 506.

Request of Sayyid Turki that Government would procure a Steamer for him. — On 22nd June Colonel Miles forwarded to the Acting Resident, for favourable consideration, copy of a letter addressed to him by Sayyid Turki, soliciting that Government would procure for him a steamer, and deduct her cost by instalments from the Zanzibar subsidy. In submitting this request to Government, Captain Prideaux remarked that, while concurring with Colonel Miles in his esti mate of the advantages which would accrue to the Sultan from the posses sion of a steamer, he thought the proposed mode of payment open to objection, and that the cost of maintaining such a vessel would he inconvenient to ITis Highness.

Request of Sayyid Turki that the Political Agent would acknowledge hills drawn by him against Govr^findi^ instalments of the Zanzibar subsidy still subsidy as might remain due.” Colonel Miles explained to the Minister that he could not comply with the request, because he had no authority to pay the subsidy to any one but Sayyid Turki personally, whereupon the Minister observed that, as the matter was one of much importance to the Sultan, he was instructed to beg that the sanction of Government might be obtained. Captain Prideaux, in addressing Government, remarked that— “ he had no doubt that His Highness would be enabled to obtain advances from the banians on easier terms if it were known that the loans were made, not on his own personal security, but on that of the Government of India; but considering that the assumption of such a responsibility might, under certain circumstances, be embarrassing, Lieutenant-Colonel 509. Sayyid Turki’s distrust of his nephews, sons of the late vinced that they were secretly intriguing with evilly disposed persons to subvert his authority. He had, therefore, determined to remove them from Maskat, resided. The fourth, Sayyid Muhammad, was too unwell to be removed, and against a fifth, Sayyid Nasir, the Sultan did not entertain suspicions. Colonel Miles remarked:— against these young men, but Maskat is never free from intrigue, aud His Highness has probably some ground for his proceedings.” 510.—Position of affairs in ’Oman on 1st September 1876.— Although at this date there was a lull of active opposition to Sayyid Turki’s rule, the situation did not promise any great duration of tranquillity. The three turbu lent Bedouin Shaikhs, Hamood El Jahafi, Amir bin Salim, and Rashid bin Jumeea, whom the Sultan had taken courage to arrest and imprison in April, but had set at liberty in July, were striving to organize a coalition of Sharki- yah tribes to attack him. Shaikh Sali bin Ali was ostensibly endeavouring to counteract their efforts, hut in him no trust could be placed. Sayyid Abdul Aziz had, since the failure of negotiations to effect an arrangement between him and the Sultan in May, been residing at Semed in straitened cir cumstances. His co-operation in any enterprise to subvert his brother's au thority might be reckoned upon. Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee was a State ter Sayyid Saeed, to— “ acknowledge some accommodation hills issued by His Highness against the Zanzibar subsidy, by giving verbal assurance to the holders that the amounts would be paid by Government, in the event of anything happening to His Highness, to the extent of such portion of the Miles bad, he thought, acted with discretion in declining to lend an ear to the Minister’s proposal.” From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 2040-P., dated 6th September 1876.

Sayyid Turki thought they would endeavour to plunder Seeb, and, as there was no fort there, the Political Agent, at the Sultan’s re quest, directed the Hindu traders to remove themselves and their property to Burka or Maskat. H.M S. Arab proceeded to Seeh to afford the traders the protection of her presence, and any assistance they might require. 512.

The Sultan intimated to Colonel Miles that, as the banians had had full notice and time to remove their property, he did not consider himself responsible for their losses. 513. While at Seeb, Shaikh Hamood wrote to the Political Agent, reminding him how certain moneys, which he had deposited with British subjects at Maskat, had, when he was imprisoned in April, 1875, been given up to Sayyid Turki. He asked Colonel Miles to require the Sultan to refund these sums, and advised him to warn British sub jects to retire to places of security, as he could not be answerable for their safetv. To this letter Colonel Miles did not reply—a course which Govern ment approved. From Resilient, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of* India, No. 227, dated 7th October 1876. Poll.

Sayyid Turki, warned by Shaikh Salih bin Ali, had ordered Sayyid Beder bin Saif, the Wali of Sohar, to take special measures for the protection of Saham, and Sayyid Beder had placed a guard there, but, misled by rumour, had with drawn it.

Poll. A., January 1877, Nos. 8-59. Shaikh Barghash, but that nothing had been arranged. The Sultan had then with as yet him at Burka not more than 300 men, having dismissed the Jenebeh and Deros tribes, on whom he had previously much depended. Colonel Miles wrote .— “ These tribes would have been of great service, probably, bad His Highness really intended to march out and punish Hamood and his followers, but, as Sayyid Turki has preferred negot a- tions to hostilities, they became a useless burden and expense, the present state of affairs discloses very clearly the extreme feebleness of His Highness Sayyid Turki’s ho d on the country, and'his inability to hold the reins with firmness. His Highness never had a better opportunity of striking a blow at rebellion, but bis conduct in the present juncture will not I P fear tend to strengthen bis position. The A1 Wahibeh, the tribe to which Shaikh Hamood belongs, is now at feud with five or six powerful tribes including the Jenebeh, Beni u Hasan, and El Hishm, and, had His Highness taken the field with the support of these t ibe he could have driven Hamood back to his country with ease, and would have done moie foi the pacification of the country than he could effect by any amount of expenditure. 519. A report that Sayyicl Ibrahim bin Kais had risen, and was expected to move upon Burka and Matt rah, caused Colonel Miles to request the Commander of H.M.S.

Savyid Ibrahim tried to persuade the Yal Sa’ad to rise with him, but they, mindful of the punishment inflicted upon them at Mesna ah tuo years before, declined to do so. 520. Sayyid Turki left Burka secretly on the night of the 26th October in a small boat, accompanied by two attendants only, and without communicat ing. bis intention to the Commandant, or any one in the place. He reached Maskat on the 28th. 521. On the 10th November Colonel Miles reported that a collision had occurred between the revolted Maawal tribe, aided by Shaikh Ilamood, and the people of Nakhl, in which the latter had been routed with a loss of 17 killed. A proposal, made by Shaikh Barghash, as mediator, that Sayyid Turki should pay Hamood dollars 2,000 to retire to his own country, was rejected by the Sultan, and negotia tions broken off. Some days later a party of 40 of the Maawal were waylaid by 200 of the Nakhl men, and cut to pieces. 522. This incident afforded Sayyid Turki an opportunity to intervene, and, on 8th 'December Colonel Miles reported that the From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, No. 258, dated 1/th November 1876.

Colonel Miles summed up the situation on 22nd December as follows :— “ In the Nakhl Valley, therefore, and in Batinah, peace has been quite restored, and trade communications between Nakhl, Wadi Maawal and Buvka resumed, but in the Sema.il Valley the Beni Ruweyeh tribe, who f:om the first have never been on really good terms with Sayyid Turki, are said to be still disaffected, though they have not as yet shown any overt acts of hostility. In the Sharkiyah, Shaikh Saleh's relations with Sayyid Turki remain unchanged, and the province is free from disturbance, but it is rumoured that Sayyid^ Abdul Aziz is'about to quit Semed, and take up his residence with the Beni Bu Hasan tribe.'

Sayyid Abdul Aziz . —After the rejection by Sayyid Abdul Aziz, in May 1876, of Sayyid Turki’s offer of an Precis, paragraph 493 . allowance of dollars 500 monthly, on the condition that he retired from ’Oman and resided in India, negotiations to that precise end were not renewed: but, in the following G«verLe R nTot n i!lLfNr 207 , nl dated August, Shaikh Salih hin Ali submitted to the i6th September 1876. Sultan certain proposals, regarding which Colonel A., January 1877, Nos. 8-59. r 1 J » J Miles wrote :— Poll. “ I understand from the Minister, Sayyid Said, that the proposal is to locate Sayyid Abdul Aziz at Seeb, or some other place where there is no fort, and where he will have no facilities for intrigue. Sayyid Abdul Aziz still persistently refuses to leave 'Oman, but he is greatly pressed for expenses, and, should a sufficient allowance be granted him, it seems not improb able that he might accept this arrangement.' From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 216, dated 22nd September 1876. Poll. A., January 1877, Nos. 8-59. 528. It would appear that Sayyid Abdul Aziz declined the above pro posal, if made to him, for, on 14th September, Colonel Miles reported that Sayyid Turki had arranged with El Haboos of Semed, through Shaikh Salih bin Ali, the following scheme, viz., that a number of Shaikhs of that tribe should visit Maskat; that the Sultan should arrest them for alleged complicity with Sayyid Abdul Aziz; and that the tribe should thereupon require Abdul Aziz to quit ’Oman, in order that their Shaikhs might he released. The Minister, Sayyid Said, informed Colonel Miles that the El Hahoos had already been paid dollars 500 for the anticipated service, and were to receive dollars 1,000 more on its completion. Colonel Miles was of opinion that, as the El Haboos had succeeded in obtaining part of the money, the scheme would come to nothing, as it did, the Shaikhs failing to visit Maskat.124 529.

Sayyid Abdul Aziz. On 30th March Colonel Miles reported:— “ His Highnes Sayyid Turki ha-* of late been again advised by several influential persons to grant his brother Abdul Aziz a small pension, and Sayyid Hilal bin Ahmed, whom His Highness consulted on the subject, strongly counselled him to do so. Sayyid Turki is much inclined to this course himself, as he told me that his brother was living in a pitiable state of poverty at Semed, but he has not yet decided upon granting anything. This is owing, I have reason to believe, to the counsel of the Minister Sayyid Said, who is averse to any arrangement being made with Sayyid Abdul Aziz, short of his leaving the country. I am somewhat afraid this advice is dictated more by feelings of private animosity than by consideration for His Highness's interests on the part of the Minister, as there can he little doubt that the grant of a small sum, sufficient for his subsistence, but not enough for purposes of intrigue, would go far to remove the temptation to revolt on the part of A bdul Aziz. ” 531. The Sultan appears to have yielded to the Minister’s advice. 532.

On the conclusion of the investigations which are being made as to the extent of the losses, Sayyid Turki should he requested to pay the necessary compensation from the advance of half a year's subsidy, which was sanctioned in the telegram from this office No. 4&lt;i3-P of 18th ultimo.'

He has since then been repeatedly reminded of the matter, and has, as often promised, a settlement, but, owing to his constant pecuniary embarrassments, he has not yet done anything towards clearing them off. About two months ago, I again personally brought the matter to His Highness's recollection, and requested his serious attention to it. I heard of no steps being taken in the matter however, until I received the accompanying letter, in which His Highness proposes to liquidate the claims, amounting to dollars 4 73S? by instalments of dollars 1,000, deducted quarterly from the subsidy, which would thus require about one year and a quarter. Besides the above, there is the balance of the claims125 of the Meena’ah traders for losses sustained in the attack on that town in 1874&lt; hy Ibrahim bin Kais and the Yal Sa^ad still outstanding against His Highness. As regards this balance, however, I would most respectfully submit that the amount obtained from the \al Sa'ad tribe, and already distributed to the traders, has, in my opinion, fairly compensated them for their losses, and might, perhaps, be considered sufficient to satisfy justice without further payment on the part of H.H. Sayyid Turki.” 534. With reference to the Mattrah claims, Colonel Prideuux was of opinion that, as there appeared to be no chance of recovering the money in any other way, the Sultan’s proposal should be accepted, and the Poli tical Agent empowered to deduct dollars 1,000 from each quarterly payment of the subsidy until the whole amount was liquidated.

The orders of Government were as fol lows :— “ The Governor General in Council is pleased, under the circumstances represented, to sanction your proposal to empower the Political Agent, Maskat, to deduct the sum of dollars 1,000 from each quarterly payment of the Maskat-Zanzibar subsidy, until the whole amount required to make good the losses incurred by British Indian traders at Mattrah in January 1874, shall have been liquidated. “ With regard to your proposal, that the balance oustanding against His Highness Sayyid Turki, on account of the losses of Mesna’ah traders in consequence of the attack made by Ibrahim bin Kais in 1874 should be i-emitted, I am directed to invite your attention to this office letter No. 1670-P., dated 8th June 1'75, and to observe that it was decided that an in vestigation should be made into the claims of traders remaining unsatisfied, and that payment should be exacted from Sayyid Turki only for such of them as were established, a id have not been satisfied by the payment already made by the Yal Sa’ad tribe. Until this investiga tion has been made and reported, His Excellency in Council is unable to decide whether the indemnity due from His Highness can be remitted or not.” From Government of India, to Resident, Persian GuK, No. 529-P., dated 9th March 1877.

Colonel Miles submitted the following ex planation :— “On the occurrences at Mesna’ah in March 1874, being reported to Government, I re* ceived instructions from the Political Resident, Colonel Ross, to investigate and report on the losses sustained by British subjects at the hands of Sayyid Ibrahim and the rebels. A punch- ayat of merchants was accordingly assembled at Maskat to assist in the inquiry, and all the evidence that could be produced by the Mesna’ah traders on behalf of their claims was taken. The claims then submitted amounted to a total of dollars 11,067, and one other claim was subsequently admitted of dollars 1,650, making the whole dollars H,717. “ The amount recovered from the Yal Sa’ad, dollars 9,6i)0, was distributed rateably amongst the traders, giving to each of them a share equal to about f ths of his claim. The balance still due on these claims amounts therefore to dollars 3,117. As most of the trade- books have been destroyed, and no fresh evidence regarding the state of the property possessed by the claimants and plundered during the outrage is likely to be forthcoming, I fear it would not be possible, by re-investigating the claims, to arrive at a more correct estimate of the actual extent of the losses sustained, and I would, most respectfully, submit that the amount already given of dollars 12,717 be adopted, as representing the total loss of the Mesna’ah traders.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, No. 113, dated 4th May 1877. Poll. A., July 1877, Nos. 143-145. 538. Colonel Prideaux, after pointing out a tri fling mistake in Colonel Miles’ calculation, and show ing that the balance was properly dollars 3,144- 50, added :— • “ It remains for His Excellency in Council to decide whether, as an act of grace towards the Sultan, the sum should be remitted. If the question should be decided in the negative, itwill probably be necessary to adopt the same measures for the recovery of the money as were lately sanctioned in the case of the claims against His Highness for losses sustained by the Mattrah traders.” 539. Government decided that the balance of dollais 3,144-50 should be recovered from Sayyid Turki, by instalments or dollars 1,000, to be deducted from each quarterly No.. 143 - 145 . payment of the Zanzibar subsidy. 540. Compensation to Indian traders plundered at Saham, by Shaikh Hamood El Jahafl in October 1876 — From Resident, Pereian Gulf, to Gov- Qn 22nd December 1876, Colonel Miles, in sub- Januaryis?? “ ‘ a ’ ° ’ mitting a statement of claims made by the Indian Poll. A., July 1877, n&lt;.b. 126 - 140 . traders, plundered at Saham by Shaikh Hamood El Jahafl in the previous October, wrote: « The accounts and vouchers of these traders have been investigated by myself and as committee of merchants, and the claims, as now set down, are believed to be fair and just. The statements of all the other traders corroborate those of the two men whose depositions are, attached inessential points. They all aver that the inhabitants of Saham assisted in plund- erino- their property, when the example had been set by Hamood and his people. Ibis is con firmed by other evidence I have obtained, and there is, I believe, no room for doubt in the matter The traders are unanimous in declaring that they have no wish or intention to return to Saham, and, considering that the Arabs of that town, not only did not protect them from Hamood, which undoubtedly they were well* able to do, but even assisted to despoil them, 1 think it as well they should not resettle there under the circumstances. « Jt will be observed that of the claims submitted, part is for property actually plundered and part, viz., dollars 2,517, is for outstandings against the inhabitants of Saham and it vicinity. These outstanding debts have been included, as there is little or no chance of their beino- recovered unless the traders return thither, and it may be a question for consideration whether the Saham people should not be made to pay compensation for at least this part of the claim.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, Ko 6, dated 6th January 1877. Poll. A., July 1877, Nos. 126-140. 541. Colonel Prideaux addressed Government as follows :— “ It appears from the statements that the actual value of the property plundered from the Indian traders amounted to dollars 3,544 : but an additional sum of dollars 2,5 17 is claimed on account of outstanding debts at Saham, of which, it is stated, there is no chance of iccovery unless the traders return to that place—a measure to which the Political Agent is opposed. “ The plunder of these traders was chiefly owing to the neglect and inaction of the Governor of Sohar, Sayyid Bedar bin Saif. Although this Chief had received timely warning that Shaikh Hamood was expected to attack Saham, he failed to take any effectual precautions for the protec tion of the town. The local authorities, moreover, appear to have deserted the place on the ap proach of Shaikh Hamood, and to have left it in the hands of some subsidized Bedouins, who assisted the insurgents in plundering the bazaar. &lt;( The insurrection in the Batinah is reported to be at an end, and it would be useless to look for the recovery of the plundered property from those who were lately in rebellion. The responsibility for an event which might have been averted, if the officers of Sayyid Turki had displayed a little more activity and vigour, must, in my opinion, fall upon His Highness. The case is one of some hardship, for it is tolerably clear that if his orders had been obeyed, the place would not have suffered. It is, therefore, with some regret that I feel compelled to record the opinion that His Highness should be called upon to indemnify the traders for the losses actually incurred by them in the plunder of the town. I am not yet prepared to say that the accident of the town having been once plundered by Bedouins is an insuperable obstacle to the return of the traders ; or that, if the town were occupied by an efficient garrison, it would not be possible to secure payment of its outstanding debts by the ordinary means employed in such cases. On this point I shall request a further expression of opinion from the Political Agent before submitting my views finally to Government.” 542. To Colonel Miles the Hesident wrote :— “ To compensate the traders for losses, which might be classed as ordinary mercantile 126isks in semi-civilized countries, might, I think, in certain cases, be inconvenient as a precedent.^ Colonel Miles replied “ With regard to the question of payment of compensation for the outstanding debts of the 7 * p -n culf to Saham trader, I am quite of opinion that, so far as the From 37 datS traders are concerned, and apart from the policy of the step, mh r Sl y 1 it ' the delits might lie considered as ordinary mercantile r.sks ; Poll.

The Yal Bu Kareyn so far have profited more by the transac- banians Hamood and the rebels, as they not only secured their share of the booty, have also relived themselves of a load of debt. 1 do not look on the mere fact of the + Ut i been plundered by the Bedouins as a matter of any great significance m an town u ^ » j.j ^Oman- It may be useless to look to Shaikh Hamood and his followers 1C but it would be, I believe, by no means difficult to punish the Yal Bu Kareyn, for rep.ua_ , them Suoh a cou ,. se would, I consider, be highly advan- f n t ‘British and commercial interests on this coast, and also to His Highness ^ayjid tageous to B„t wbet , )er His Highness could coerce the tribe without support and assistance from the British Government.” 543 Regarding these views Colonel Prideaux remarked :— t&lt; mVio rlrlfi of Colonel Miles’ letter is that the British Government should take upon 1 n if t itself the task of coercing the Yal Bn Kareyn, with a view From Resident, Persian Ouif^ to btaini re d res s from that tribe for their conduct towards 187 n 7 ’ the British traders. 1 have before observed that the plunder Poll, a., July 1877, Nos. 126 140. 0 £ £ be £ ra (] ers wa g due to the fact that the Governor of &lt;a b „r Sawid Beder bin Saif, neglected to obey the instructions which he had received from 7 7 ter Saw id Turki. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles admits that the disaster was partly the oLlVof Savvid Bedar’s mistake, but adds that it was also due to the treachery and misconduct 7 n eonle of the town. But it is plain that the people of the town would not have had an onnortunitv of behaving treacherously if Sayyid Bedar had obeyed his instructions and taken ^77 nTsures for the protection of the place. The losses of the traders resulted partly from li ^ ttink made by Shaikh Hamood’s Bedouins, and partly from the people of the town taking TtVnlZe of that attack to do some plundering on their own acconnt. But the primary ‘ ‘onsibility must still rest on the Sultan’s officers, who failed to do their duty, and I see no grounds for changing my opinion that we must look to His Highness for any reparation which it may be decided to enforce. . .. . , « With regard to compensating the traders for their outstanding debts, the policy ot such a measure appears to me very questionable. If the inhabitants of a town find that they can wine off their scores with the local Indian traders by the additional process ot plundering 1 frightening: them out of the place, they will not be slow to take advantage of this new att tn rviv old debts.’ It also appears very unlikely that the Bedouins and rabble of the ^ who ioined in the plunder, were the persons with whom the Indians had mercantile transactions. ° Twould, theieforc, respectfully* suggest that, while His Highness Sayy.d Tnrl-i should beheld accountable for the actual losses incurred in the plunder of the town, fRp Indian traders should be informed that they should hand in their accounts to the 1 ohtical Acrent and should request him to employ his good offices with the Maskat Government in obtaining a settlement of their outstanding claims against Maskat subjects residing in Saham.” From Government of India to 5 ^ 4 .

Return of Indian traders to Saham and Dil— In March 1877, Sayyid Bedar Bin Saif, Wali of Sohar, wrote to Go^lmenr'orindia,' n'^ 87 ,'d^ed the Political Agent that some of the banians, who 6th April 1877. were plundered by Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi at Saham in the previous August, had returned to that place and Dil against his wishes. He requested that they might he ordered to return to Sohar. At the same time, Colonel Miles received from one of the banians, still at Sohar, a request for permission to return to Saham, wherein he stated that he had “ no fear of the inhabitants, for that between them and the banians there was no ill-^eeliDg. ,, „ ,, . 547.

SS1011 etb April 1877. 0 f hig views and wishes, the Sultan— “observed that both Dil and Saham were unwalled towns, and therefore exposed, to the attacks and raids of rebels and Bedouins, and that he thought the traders had better remain at Sohar, where they would be quite safe and under the protection of Sayyid Bedar.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 87, dated 6th April 1877. 548. In reply to a request of Colonel Miles for instructions, Colonel Prideaux wrote :— “ I have to observe that under Article I of the Commercial Treaty with Maskat, the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty have full liberty to enter, reside in, trade with, and pass with their merchandize through all parts of the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, and that, under Article VIII of the same instrument, if a subject of His Highness, tlie Sultan of Maskat, should resist or evade payment of his just debts to a British subject, the authority of His Highness snail afford to the British subject every aid and facility in recovering the amount due. Under the strict constructio' of the treaty, therefore, I am &lt;»f opinion that His Highness is not at liberty to prevent the banians in question from residing and carrying on trade within the towns of Dil and Saham, should they think fit to do so; and I further consider that Sayyid Bedar bin Saif, who is stated in your letter under replv to be the local authority in those towns, should alford them every aid and facility in his power in recovering the outstanding debts, which one of the banians alleges he is desirous of collecting at Saham. “ It only remains to consider whether there are such exceptional circumstances in'the present case as would justify temporary relaxation of the treaty obligations of Sayyid Turki. The town of Saham was lately expo-ed to the attack of a party of Bedouin Arabs, and some of the resident banians suffered mab treatment and losses at their hands, but there seems to be no reason to suppose that this attack will be repeated, and the banians themselves assert that they are not apprehensive of ill-usage from the inhabitants of the district. We cannot be too cautious in permitting any departure from the engagements of a treaty, on which we principally rely for the privileges and the advantages enjoyed by British subjects in Maskat territory. “ I am, therefore, of opinion that, pending the receipt of instructions from the Govern ment of India, to whom the question will be referred for final decision, the banians should he permitted, if they wish it, to reside in Dil and Saham, and that His Highness the Sultan should he requested to convey to Sayyid Bedar bin Saif his orders to afford them every aid and facility in his power, in effecting the recovery of their outstanding claims.” 549. On the 2Gth April Colonel Miles reported :— “ I have communicated to His Highness Sayyid Turki your opinion that the banians should be permitted, if they wish it, to reside in Oil and Saham, and I have requested his Highness to desire Sayyid Bedar bin Saif to aid them in effecting the recovery of their out standing claims.” 550. Allowance granted by Sayyid Turki to his nephews, Muham- 128mad, Abdul Aziz, and Hamdan, sons of the late Sayyid Thowainee— In r- „ A „ July, 18*7, Colonel Miles received from Sayyids From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gor- -.ri \ itt i eminent of India, No. 16 , dated 20 th Miuiammad, Abdul Aziz, and llamdan, sons oi the J TjiV 3 1 Lc! i 18-7 No, 32.38 late Sa J r y id Tliowainee, whom Sayyid Turki had, in July 1876, deported from Maskat, and who were residing at Lingah, a letter, praying him to move the Sultan to grant them n ,. . an allowance sufficient for their wants. The letter concluded with the remark :— “ Should we not obtain our desires? Be not offended if we resort to other means to obtain them. Let each look to himself.” 551. The threat caused Sayyid Turki to refuse compliance w ith the request, when first brought to his notice, but on 2nd February Colonel Miles reported : — From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 31, dated 9th February 1877. Poll. A., March 1877, Nos. 32-38. “ In a further conversation I had, a few days since, with H is Highness, relative to the sons of the late Sayyid Thowai nee, His Highness informed me that he had resolved to grant an allowance to them, to commence from the first of the pre sent Muhammadan month. “ By this mail, however, His Highness received another letter from them, of the same objectionable tone as the former one, and His Highness was at first disposed to alter his inten tion about the allowance, but on his sending the letter over for my perusal, 1 suggested the advisability of his taking no notice of it, and to this Sayyid Turki has been good enough to accede. The amount he lias arranged to give them is dollars I2U a month. “ The mail has also brought me a letter from these young men of the same purport as the former one, and I have, at His Highness’s request, taken the opportunity, in my reply, to express disapproval of the tone they have chosen to adopt in their applications to the Sultan in this matter ” From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 537-P., dated 10th March 1877.

From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 39, dated 17th February 1877. Poll. A , April 1877, Nos. 309 312. 554. Colonel Prideaux in forwarding to Gov ernment the application and Colonel Miles’s obser vations thereon, epitomized them and submitted his own views as follows :— “The Commandant of the fort, Shaikh Saif bin Hamad of the Beni Ruweyeh tribe, has for some time past, been suspected by His Highness of intriguing against his authority. His Highness states he has no desire to deprive the Commandant of his charge, provided he comes and gives in his submission, and sues for forgiveness for his past misdeeds. His Ilio-hness however, virtually admits that nothing overt can be proved against the Commandant, and it is not likely, therefore, that the latter will trust himself in His Highness’s power, merely for the purpose of clearing up a vague suspicion. If Sayyid Turki distrusts his chiefs, his chiefs will naturally distrust him, and His Highness would, in my opinion, display a wiser policy if he would drop this constant attitude of suspicion, and adopt a more 'frank and cordial demeanour in dealing with his subordinate officers. “ 1 venture to think that there is nothing to call for a despatch of a vessel-of-war to Sowaik, even if one could be conveniently spared at the present juncture. A few words of advice, dissuasive of any attempt to coerce the garrison of Sowaik would probably be more opportun- than any assistance which a vessel of-war could afford.” From Government of India to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 892-P., dated 30th April 1877. Poll. A., April 1877, Nos. 309-312. 129 555, In reply the Resident was instructed : — “ The Government of India concurs in your opinion that there is no necessity to despatch a British vessel-of-war to130 Sowaik, and that a f6w words of advico to Sayyid Turki, dissuasive of any attempt on his part to coerce tlie garrison of that place, would be more opportune than any assistance which a man-of-war could afford. 1 am to request that a reply m this sense may be sent to His Highness through the Political Agent, Maskat.” 556. Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee removes from Kishm to Bassi- dore—On 28th March 1877, Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee, then at Kishm, addressed to the Resident a request that Government would mediate between him and Sayvid Turki, and induce the Sultan to allow him to reside at Maskat, as he had reason to complain of the conduct of the Shaikh of Kishm towards him. He begged that, in the event of Sayyid Turki refusing to have him at Maskat, he might be allowed to live at Basidore. 557. In reply, Colonel Prideaux informed him, through Assistant Surgeon Hakeem, in charge of Bassidore Station, that he saw no objection to his re siding there— f ‘ provided he is content to live in a quite, unobtrusive manner, and abstain from any intrigues or behaviour calculated to disturb the tranquillity of Maskat.” 558. To the Political Agent, Maskat, the Resident wrote:— “If you could find an opportunity of bringing to the notice of Sayyid Turki, in an unofficial wny, the desire of Sayyid Harib to be reconciled to His Highhess, I can see no objec tion to your doing so.” Colonel Miles replied :— “ I have mentioned the desire of Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee to be reconciled to his uncle in conversation with His Highness Sayyid Turki, and was informed by His Highness that he had no ill-feeling towards his nephew, but that he objected to Sayyid Harib residing in Maskat, on account of the opportunity it w’ould give to ill-disposed persons to intrigue. His Highness thought it better Sayyid Harib should not come to 'Oman. I did not consider it advisable to press the subject on His Highness.” On 25th May, the Assistant Surgeon at Bassidore, reported that Sayyid Harib had taken up his residence there^_^ 55&gt;r. Rising of El Sliarkiyeh tribes under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and aayyid Ibrahim bin Kais: Siege of Maskat: Eepulse of the rebels by H.M.S. Teazer % —Rumours of the seditious activity of Sayyid Turki’s enemies in El Sharkiyeh, the most considerable of whom were Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi of the A1 Wahibah, and SbaikhjAmir and Rashid of the Beni Bu Hasan, reached Maskat from time to time during the early part of 1877. On 26th April Colonel Miles reported :— “ The movement in El Sharkiyeh has again shown signs of becoming serious, as the disaffected tribes have since gained the adhesion of the From Kesidcnt, Persian Gvilf to re ]i ff i ous f ac tion, who are now engaged in encouraging other SMav ' ' tribes to rise, ami in urging the need for rebellion against Poll.

Poll. A., November 1878, No. 10o (A to I). 560 Early in May a collision occurred between the Ghafiris and Hina- weesfn the SeLil Valley, which Sayyid Turid deemed to be of -ch senoue import that he deputed the Minister Sayyid Said to the s^t to endear ou t effect an amicable arrangement between the parties. In th ®' ■ j ” . succeeded. A truce for six months was agreed upon, but the iimawee remained dissatisfied. 561 On 5tli June, Colonel Miles reported Shaikh Salih has written to His Highncss Savyid Turki, advising him to allow his brother, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, dollars 100, and to pay Rashid bin Jnmeea and Amir bin (A to i). Salim, the two Shaikhs who were imprisoned with Hamood bin Said El Jahafi, the sum of dollars GOO each, hut I have not heard what answer has been given to these requests.” 562. The answer was apparently not of the nature derired or fmled to „ • r„if to conciliate the party to which Shaikhs Amu am eo^“di^6t LS Salim belonged, for, on 9th June, the Acting seth .iimo 1R77. Political Agent, Mr. Robertson, received fro f /t°oV'’ Shaikh Salih bin Ali a letter, announcing that certain of the Sharkiyeh tribes were about to march on Maskat, and warning hhn to take measures for the safety of British subjects. To this communication the Acting Political Agent replied h ave to inform you that any attempt on your part to attack Mattrah or Maskat will 1 have to } be - r dpdas a rebellion against an esteemed ally of the From Rositlont, Persian Gulf to B . * Govemm e n t, and you will he held responsible tor all N3, ’ “sequences resulting to yourself and others from your Poll.

On the 14th June the rebels, under the leadership of Shaikh Salih bin Ali, reached Mattrah and occupied it unopposed, and on the loth H.M.S. Teazer opportunely arrived at Maskat. 564. Mr. Robertson reported on 21st June “ Soon after the news of Shaikh Salih’s advance from El Sharkiyeh got abroad, it was mired that Sawid Abdul Aziz accompanied him. It turned out, however, that they had rUT t nt Man«ah aVlace in the Semial Valley, hut failed to come to an understanding, and Abdul ^^“eVerechwheve ho usually Lide.

Such being the odds, it seemed possible that, despite anything the Teazer might do, tbe rebels were capable of effecting an en.ranee, and it was highly necessary to place the lives of British subjects beyond their reach, before exaspeiatmg them by opening fire. I, therefore, issued an order to all the banians in Alaskat to go on board the ships in the harbour, and then wrote a letter to Sayyid Ibrahim, copy of which is annexed, warning him that, if his force attempted to enter the town, the Teuzcr would open fire upon them. To this letter I received no answer, but at sunset on the 17th the rebels appeared to be preparing for the assault, and Captain \\ odehouse, at the recpusition of Sayyid Turki, fired some shots into the valley behind the town. A few more shots were fired at midnight and they seemed to have had the desired effect, as the enem^, although frequently seen in the course of the night, did not attack. “On the 18th, Sayyid Turki requested that H.M.S. might proceed to Mattrah, and dislodge from certain houses adjoining the citadel some rebels of the Ilaboos anil other tribes, whose fire was galling the garrison. His wishes were carried out, and I took the opportunity to remove under cover of the 1'etiZer’s guns all British subjects from the Khojah Fort, and to place them in safety on board the ships in the harbour. That done, the TeazKf returned to Maskat, and pursued the same course as on the previous night. The rebels appeared at various points during the night, but did not 1 attack. “ Shaikh Salih had obtained the adhesion of the predatory tribes who accompanied him by the promise of plunder, as well as specific pecuniary rewards, and they had been led to believe that little or no resistance would be offered to their entry into Maskat. “ On the 19th they began to show signs of dissension, and some of them sent messages to Sayyid Turki, tendering excuses for their presence, and stating that they had been deceived, and were about to retire. Shamis bin Hasan, a Shaikh of the Awamir, arrived from Shaikh Salih, offering to come to terms, and it became evident that the coalition was breaking up. Sayyid Turki replied by Shamis that he would hold no communication with Shaikh Salih until he and his followers retired to Rui, which they did in the course of the nio-ht. On the following day I took Sayyid Said at His Highness’s request to Mattrah in the Teazer. He proceeded thence to Falaj and had an interview with Shaikh Salih, who demanded dollars 20,000 and the continuation of his own and Sayyid Ibrahim’s allowances, as conditions of their retiring. When consulted regarding these demands, I expressed an opinion that they were absurd, and that any demand for money on Shaikh Salih’s part should, for the present, be firmly resisted, especially as His Highness’s supporters were now beginning to arrive from various directions, and Maskat was no longer in much danger. This morning His Highness sent word to Shaikh Salih that he would pay him nothing, and that he might stay or go as he pleased. It is reported that the rebel force is breaking up rapidly. “To judge by the conduct of the Bedouins at Mattrah and Sadab, where they plundered everything within their reach, and wantonly massacred several children and unarmed negroes, it is obvious that the consequence of their entry into Maskat must have been most deplorable. I trust, therefore, that my action, wherein I was guided by the advice of Colonel Miles, will be approved, and I beg to bring prominently to the notice of Government the very ready and able manner in which Commander Capel Wodehouse of H.M.S. Teazer co-operated with me, and the extreme courtesy and cordiality with which he carried out all my suggestions.” 565. la addressing Government, Colonel Prideaux remarked:— “ It mav be useful if I recapitulate the orders which have, from time to time been issued by the Government of India, when a crisis of a similar nature to that which has just occurred lias threatened the safety of Maskat, and imperilled the numerous British interests which are dependent on, the tranquillity of that place. In January 1874, when Salih bin Ali occupied Mattrali and was preparing to attack Maskat, much in the same manner as he is now reported to have done, the Government of India telegraphed to Lieutenant-Colonel Ross: ‘You have full power to help Turki actively so far as guns of vessels-of-war will reach, and to protect British interest. Undertake no operation on shore ’ Shortly after wards, when Maskat was threatened by Ibrahim bin Kais, the Government of India tele graphed : ‘ Active assistance on Batinah coast cannot be given to Turki; if Maskat is attacked, former instructions in Salih’s case will apply.’ Some explanatory remarks were added in a further telegraph: ‘As regards matters in which Turki only is concerned, and interests of British subjects are not immediately concerned, Major Miles will be careful to get Tuiki’s assent to his action. With this proviso, and subject to the condition that no oper ations are to be undertaken onshore, Major Mdes should support Turki as far as guns ivom sea can reach, as already directed.’ These instructions were continued in a later telegram from the Government of India. “ It is to be gathered from Mr. Aitchison’s despatch, No., 2749-P., dated 12th December,133 1874, that these instructions were merely applicable to the particular emergencies which called them forth, and that they did not amount to a general and unconditional promise of support to Say\id Turki. In the orders marginally noted, the Political Agent is most distinctly enjoined to avoid interference in the dynastic and internal No. 758-P., dated 28th February 1875 No. 12i 0-1*., dated 30th April 1875.

The Political Agent was informed that, if the Sultan asked formally in writing for active support, he was to give it him as far as the guns of our vessels could reach, but that armed assistance should not lie volunteered, nor should it be given unless, on the occasion of any particular crisis, it was formally asked for. If the lives and pr-perty of British subjects were in danger, the Political Agent was authorized to do whatever might be necessary for their protection. But he was enjoined to bear in mind the general policy of non-interference in the internaloffairs of ’Oman, if it could possibly be avoided, “ In the emergency which the Political Agent was recently called upon to meet, there was no question of interference in the dynastic or internal affairs of’Oman. If the attempt had succeeded, there would doubtless have been a change of dynasty ; but such a contingency was beyond the bounds of the Political Agent’s province. He had been apprised by the insurgent chief that the property of the British subjects who had settled in Maskat, under the shelter of the British flag was in danger, and he had received a formal requisition from the Sultan for assistance. If the Bedouins, whose bait was plunder, had entered Maskat, the loss of property, and probably of life, would have been most serious. Under the circumsta ces I do not think Mr. Robertson could have followed any other course than that which he adopted ; and it is a subject of congratulation that the immediate success of the steps which he felt compelled to take will be followed iu all likelihood by permanent results of the most beneficial kind to British interests. “ During the crisis which Mr. Robertson was called upon to face, within a day or two after his arrival at Maskat, he possessed the advantage of the experience and advice of Lieuten ant-Colonel Miles, who had given over charge of his office, but had not yet left the pi ice; and I have much pleasure in transmitting to the Government of India a copy of a letter from th at officer to my address, iu which he records his full concurrence in the advisability of the measures taken by Mr. Robertson for the protection of British interests. But the responsibility' of these measures rested upon Mr. Robertson alone ; and I trust that I shall be authorized to con vey to that officer the approval of His Excellency in Council of the firm and judicious couduct he displayed in dealing with the very difficult circumstances under which he was placed.” From Government of India to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 1976-P., dated 14th August 1877.

Break-up of the rebel forue under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais : Proceedings of Shaikh Hamooi El Jahafi and the A1 Wahibah: Advance of dollars 2,000 to Sayyid Tarki on account of the Zanzibar subsidy.—On 5th July Mr. Robertson repoYfecH—- “The Muttowwa Force at Falaj broke up and dispersed on the Mst ultimo.

Rostak, respectively. Their supporters of the Haboos, Hai th, Beni Bu Hasan, Hijrieen and Beni Ruweyeh tribes also re turned to their district; hut the Al Wahiba, under Shaikh Hamoud bin Said El Jahafi, occupied Bosher, and Hamood informed His Highness that, unless dollars *2,500 were paid to him by sunset on the 25th, he would raze houses, and cut down date trees from Maskat to Burkah.u He also wrote to the leading Khojahs at Mattrah, who own houses and date-groves at Bosher, threatening their property with destruction if a sum of dollars 1,500, which he had deposited with one of them in 1H75, were not produced. The deposit in question having been claimed by, and delivered to, Sayyid Turki, when he seized and imprisoned Hamood in April 1876, I instructed the Khojahs to refer Hamood to His Highness.” 5G8. Sayyid Turki consulted the Acting Political Agent as to ‘what course he should take with regard to Shaikh llan'iocd. As the Sultan could only muster a mixed force of 350 men against 5C0 or 6C0 of the A1 At ahihah, and as the consequence of a reverse would probably have been the re-investment and plunder of Maskat, Mr. Robertson thought it better that Sayyid Turki should comply with Hamood’s demand than risk a battle. 5G9. The Sultan addressed to the Acting Political Agent an urgent request for dollars 2,000 on account of the instalment of the Zanzibar subsidy due at the end of the month, with which Mr. Robertson complied, writing to the Resident:— a Under the circumstances, which admitted of no delay, and understanding that the Resident had invariably sanctioned compliance with a similar request, I venture to anticipate your instructions on this point, and advanced to His Highness the sum asked for.” / Colonel Prideaux replied :— “ With reference to the remark contained in your letter under acknowledgment, to the effect that it was understood the Resident had invariably sanctioned compliance with His Highness's request for an advance of the Mashat-Zanzibar subsidy, 1 have to observe that each application has been considered with careful reference to the circumstances under wdiich it was made, and that the general rule has been to refrain from compliance until the pleasure of the Government of India has been ascertained.” 570. On 2Gtb June, terms having been arranged, the sum of dollars 2,500 was paid by Sayyid Turki’s RepDresentative to the A1 AVahiban Shaikhs, who then retired to El Sliarkiyah. 571- Compensation to Indian traders plundered at Mattrah by tlie rebels under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais in June 1877 .—On 29th August 1877, Mr. Robertson, in submitting a list of claims of Indian traders at Mattrah, for losses suffered at the bands of the rebels under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Syyid Ibrahim bin Kais, and through the operations of H M.S. Teazer, wrote :— The operations of H.M.S. Tcazer consisted in dislodging the rebels from some Persian Gulf, to Govern- buildings in close proximity to Mattrah Fort, and in knock- Resident, ment of India, No. 224, dated 8th Sep tember 1877. Poll. A., November 1879, Nos. 191 245. ing down one building at the request of the minister, Sayyid Said, and the Governor of Mattrah, wdm were on board, and explained precisely what they wanted done. The build ing knocked down, whose contents were set on fire by a shell and entirely destroyed, turned out to be a warehouse in which some British subjects had placed merchandise, in the supposition that the fort’s proximity would protect their goods from plunder. “ I have taken much pains with the assistance of four assessors to verify these claims but without any very satisfactory .esult. A few of the claimants are merchants, whose hooks show the extent of their losses, hut the great majority are petty shopkeepers, who keep no accounts and whose claims rest on their assertions alone. a As regards the manner in which the claims should be dealt with, I would suggest that His Highness Sayyid Turki, be chlled upon to pay one-fourth of the sum total, including the damage done by H.M S. Teazer, and that three-fourths be levied from the plunderers. Were His Highness entirely absolved from contribution to the settlement, he would infer, despite anything he might be told to the contrary, that the obligation to assure the safety of British subjects within his dominions had in some measure been taken off his hands. To permit the Arabs, on the other hand, to retain their booty, and to oblige His Highness to pay for it, would be to encourage them in the strongest manner to repeat their offence. I think that the divi sion of liability which I have suggested will, if approved of, have a satisfactory effect in regard to both.135 “ I have not suggestod the imposition of an additional fine on the plunderers, because the damage done by H.M.S. Teazer already represents one. The tribes who plundered Mattrah were the Haboos, Harth, and Hijrieen. They all export pi’oduce via Maskator Soor to a considerable extent, and its seizure at either port would be easy.” 672. With reference to these proposals the Acting President, Major Grant, while concurring as to the advisability of making the tribes pay for what they had plundered, doubted whether Sayyid Turki’s authority was sufficient to enable him to seize their produce as suggested, and inquired : — “ Who are the purchasers of the goods sent to Maskat and Soor for shipment, are they British subjects or subjects of 'Oman ? Under what colours are the goods shipped ? And supposing that some goods were seized for payment of part of the compensation, would you not be apprehensive of fresh trouble being caused by the disaffected tribes or that the trade of Maskat would suffer owing to the inland tribes taking alarm and sending their produce to other ports for shipment.” Mr. Robertson replied- Itesident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- mont of India, No. 237, dated 4th Oc tober 1877. Poll. A., November 1879, Nos. 191- 245. “ The produce brought to Soor by the inland tribes for exportation does not, as a rule, change hands there, but is usually conveyed by the same persons who bring it *» to the coast in baghlahs, hired from the Jenebeh and Beni Bu Ali tribes, to Bombay, Aden, and Zanzibar for sale. “ I do not anticipate that any evil consequences, political or commercial, would result from a seizure of merchandise belonging to the offending tribes. I rather think that nothing would tend so much to give to 'Oman the repose and feeling of security, from whose absence the country and its trade are suffering. The immunity which marauders from El Sharkiyeh have invariably enjoyed of late years renders it easy for Shaikh Salih bin Ali and other disturbers of the peace to get together a rabble to threaten Maskat whenever it suits their purpose. But were the tribes made to feel that they, and not the Sultan, would be held responsible for injury to British subjects, who alone are worth plundering, the part nowyfclayed by Sali^h bin Ali would become impossible. “The action taken with the Yal Sa'ad, after the plundering of Mesna'ah in 1874, has given tranquillity to El Batinah, and 1 have no doubt that if a similar course be now taken with the Sharkiyeh tribes, the effect on that province will be the same. “ Soor is the only harbour on the coast of 'Oman to the south of Maskat, and the Rafsah pass leading to Soor, the only practicable route for laden animals from the interior of El Sharkiyeh to the coast. The Hijrieen and Harth tribes, whose position in El Sharkiyeh are southerly, have therefore no option but to prosecute their trade by way of Soor, while the Haboos, whose district lies more to the north, frequent Mattrah for the same purpose. It is probable that at any time during the next four months, merchandise belonging to the Hajrieen and Harth of more than sufficient value to meet the entire claim for indemnity will be found at Soor, and an order from His Highness Sayyid Turki, to the Beni Bu Ali and Jenebeh tribes, backed by the presence of one of H.M. ships, would, I have little doubt, cause it to be seized and delivered up by them, without direct action on our part. The presence of one of H.M. ships would, however, be necessary to strengthen His Highness's authority for the time being, and to show the tribes that he was acting with the approval and support of the British Government, “I have had no conversation with His Highness Sayyid Turki regarding the Mattrah claims, but I understand that His Highness is most anxious that this opportunity of breaking the influence of Shaikh Salih bin Ali and the Muttowwa faction by showing the tribes that their guidance may lead to trouble, should not be lost.” Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- 6/3.

A., November 1879, Nos. 191* 245. “The measures proposed by Mr. Robertson with regard to the seizure of the produce of the Ilijrieen and Harth tribes, when brought to the sea-coast for exportation, would have been expedient under circumstances in which His Highness Sayyid Turki could have enforced them without the aid of Government, but as such aid or interference in the internal affairs of 'Oman has been repeatedly forbidden by Government, 1 would respectfully suggest that, as hitherto. His Highness must be held responsible for the indemnity for loss incurred by British subjects during the late attack on Mattrah. “ In coming to this conclusion I have been guided by the results of past events, in which such interference has always led to continual disturbances on the mainland and reprisals on the property of British subjects.”136 574&lt;. On returning from furlough in December 1877, Colonel boss reviewed the correspondence which had passed with reference to this subject, and sub mitted his views to Government in the following :— Memorandum. “In June last an attack was made on Maskat by the El Harth, El Hijrieen and El Haboos tribes or Sharkiyeh under the leadership of Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Ibrahim bin Kais. “ 2. The leaders were warned by Mr. Robertson by letter that they would be held re sponsible for all consequences. “3. The attack was repelled by aid of the cams of II M.S. leazcr, but, as usual, con siderable loss of property occurred. The loss of British Indian traders is estimated at from about dollars 8,000 to dollars 15,000, the latter estimate bein' recommended for adoption by the Olliciating Political Agent and the Officiating Resident, Persian Gulf. “ 4. In forwarding the estimate of losses, Mr. Robertson recommends that His Highness the Sultan should be called on to pay one-fourth, and that three-fourths should be levied from the plunderers. Mr. Robertson does not state in this letter whether he means to advise the levy of the indemnity being effected directly by the British Government, or by His Highness the Sultan, but, from subsequent letters, I infer he would propose the seizure to be made by the Sultan, with the assistance of British naval force. “ 5. In his letter No. 284 of 18th July, Mr. Robertson reported that the Hinawi tribes expected the seizure of their goods by the British Government: and, on 13th September, he reports a deputation of the Hijrieen tribes coming to the Sultan about the exportation of their dates and other produce, which they feared might be seized on reaching the coast, in retaliation for the plunder of British subjects. Mr. Robertson advised His Highness to promise nothing, but inform them they must take the risk their conduct exposed them to, unless they a^eed to pay one-half the indemnity claimed by inhabitants of Mattrah. Mr. Robertson under stood Sayyid Turki had acted on this advice. “ 6. In transmitting Mr. Robertson’s proposals to Government, the Officiating Resident expressed his doubts as to the Sultan’s ability to seize the produce of the rebellious tribes, and suggested apprehensions of such a course causing fresh trouble and injuriously affecting the trade of Maskat, by the tribes sending their goods to other forts for shipment; and in a fur ther report Major Grant fears that Sayyid Turki is not strong enough to carry out so high handed a measure, and that its adoption might lead to a fresh coalition of the discontented tribes and renewed disturbances in ’Oman. “ 7. Mr. Robertson replied on 27th September, No. 367, that he anticipated no evil consequences, political or commercial, from the proposed seizures. He considered, on the contrary, nothing would so much tend to give a feeling of repose and security. Instancing the beneficial results of the action taken with the Yal Sa’ad tribe in 1874, Mr. Robertson recom mends a similar co\irse being taken with the Sharkiyeh tribes. He considered that Sayyid Turki’s order would suffice without direct action of the British Government, but the presence of a man-of-war would be necessary to show the tribes that His Highness was acting with the approval and support of the British Government. The Officiating Political Agent urges, as an additional argument, that he had warned Shaikh Salih that he would be held responsible. “ 8. Major Grant reported to Government his opinion that the measures proposed by Mr. Robertson would be expedient, if Sayyid Turki could enforce them without the aid of Gov ernment, but as such aid and interference in the internal affairs of ’Oman had been repeatedly forbidden by Government, suggested that, as hitherto, Sayyid Turki must be held respon sible for the indemnity. “ 9. Major Grant adds that, in coming to this conclusion he has been guided by the results of past events, in which such interference has always led to continual disturbances on the mainland and reprisals on the property of British subjects. “10. Subsequently, Major Grant reports that it would appear that trade has already suffered and serious political disturbances were likely to occur, owing to the tribes taking alarm at the prospect of interference of Government, which is not at all contemplated. “11. Reporting on 22nd November, Mr. Robertson states his belief of the future tran quillity or the reverse of ’Oman will depend on the decision of Government, as to whether the Sultan or the tribes who plundered Mattrah shall indemnify the Indian traders. Mr. Robert son thinks that if the Sultan has to pay, the tribes will consider the plunder of British traders an easy way of mulcting Sayyid Turki, but if they are forced to pay themselves, it will dis courage future expeditions against the coast towns. “ 12. With regard to Sayyid Turki’s relations with Shaikh Salih bin Ali, I note the following points. In his letter, No. 323 of 16th August, Mr. Robertson reports having advis-137 ed Sayyid Turki steadily to refuse to hold any communication with Shaikh Salih, until the atter had tendered his submission and given guarantees for future good behaviour, and that Sayyid Turki concurred This action of the Officiating Political Agent was approved by Government in letter No. 2311 P of 10th October. “ 13. In his letter No. 33S of 29th August, Mr. Robertson reports that Sayyid Turki had expressed his readiness to renew friendly relations with Salih, but refused to renew his subsidy or to employ him again as his agent. “ 14. Mr. Robertson forwarded translation of a letter from Shaikh Salih to a Shaikh of the Mesakerah, affirming that the British Government had forbidden Sayyid Turki to make peace with him, Salih. &lt;f 15. The proposals submitted for consideration of Government are then as follows :— “ Mr. Robertson recommends that a proportion of the amount of British traders^ losses being fixed on the Sultan, the remainder should be exacted from the tribes by the Sultan, with support and, if necessary, aid of the British Government. Major Grant, dissenting from this view, holds that Sayyid Turki should be held responsible ; in other words, should pay the amount of the alleged losses himself. On considering the reasons given by Major Grant for rejection of Mr. Robertson’s proposal, I so far agree that Sayyid Turki is incapable of enforc ing demands for indemnity without British support, but I do not see that in this case such support would be contrary to the declared policy of Government. The other arguments adduced by Major Grant against Mr. Robertson’s proposals do not appear to me appropriate, and 1 should anticipate very ill results from a policy based on such considerations as appre hension of renewed coalitions and reprisals on British subjects. “ 16. The strong measures adopted already would have been as likely as anything else to exasperate the rebels, but it is precisely their fear of further strong measures that would restrain them from reprisals. If they once conceived the idea that our measures were framed from any fear of their proceedings, there would be little safety for our subjects and their property. My conclusions, too, from past experience are different from those arrived at by Major Grant. “17. I do not think that any of the former occasions on which the Sultan was called on to pay indemnity to British traders plundered in his territories were precisely similar to this instance. In the Mattrah case, in 1374, His Highness, having pardoned the rebels, had taken the responsibility on himself. The other cases there was evidence of neglect on the part of His II ighness’s officers. But allowing that His Highness is amenable for the whole losses, it seems doubtful whether it is advisable to cripple his resources heavily at present, and thus furnish additional inducement to his enemies, besides impunity and hope of gain, to renew their attack. “18. I am inclined to think that the reasons of a general nature adduced by Mr. Robert son for recommending that the tribes should be made to pay indemnity on this occasion are good and that the results would be as he anticipates. But there seems to me to be special grounds in favour of such a course. The Political Agent formally intimated to the leaders that they would be held responsible and a general expectation has been raised that such will be the case. A vigorous course, having been adopted so far, should, l think, be consistently pursued: else the tribes finding their fears of retribution groundless would be emboldened and would cease to attach weight to the warnings of Political Officers in future. “ 19. From the above considerations, and bearing in mind the advice already tendered to His Highness, Sayyid Turki, I am most respectfully of opinion that the most consistent and effectual policy would be to insist on the offending tribes making restitution and offering our naval assistance to the Sultan, should he require it, to enforce the measures. It would, however, in my opinion, be necessary to address the leaders of the tribes in question direct, reminding them of the warning already conveyed to them and making them aware of our demands and the intentions of Government regarding them. “ 20. Of course, if Sayyid Turki should decide to come to terms with his late assailants, Government would look to him to make good such demands as might be considered just and necessary, but His Highness evidently considers himself at.present debarred from making peace, except on conditions acceptable to Government.

The above memorandum miscarried, with some other letters from the Residencies in the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia, which unaccountablyfollowed by a period of tranquillity in ’Oman, for, although Salih Shaikh bin Ali at once resumed his career of sedition and intrigue, the tribes, apprehensive of punishment for having plundered British subjects at Mattrah, declined to sub mit themselves further to his guidance. Shaikh Salih, while striving to or ganize a fresh insurrectionary movement in El Sharkiyeh, continued to assure the Sultan of his penitence and submission and to solicit a renewal of their former relations, but Sayyid Turki, encouraged by the Acting Political Agent, with subsequent approval of Government, had hitherto rejected his overtures. 5S0.

Government, before deciding whether coercive measures against the tribe should be resorted to or not, called for a full report of the case, which Colonel Miles submitted as follows :— ' In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader at „ r. .

Jenebeti tribe, who offered violence to the watchman in Poll. A.. November 1876, Nos. 14-27. charge and carried off plunder to the value of about dollars 1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town, and the robbers made no attempt at conceal ment of themselves, but no steps were taken by the Shaikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not appear that they even offered to remonstrate with, or repress, their tribesmen. “ There was no Wall or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Soor at the time, who could have taken action in the matter, and the banian, therefore, on returning to Soor shortly after the outrage and discovering his loss, reported the matter to me, and the case was re ferred to His Highness, who promised redress. “Soon after this H.M.S. Rifleman happened to arrive at Soor, and the Shaikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offenders and would have, doubtless, caused restitution to be made to the trader, but H.M.S. Rifleman, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed and proceeded on her voyage, the Shaikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 139“During His Highness SayyU Turki's absence at Guadar last year, the case was represented, to His Highness Sayyid Abdul Aziz, but without any beneficial lesult. About this time, however, the Shaikhs of the tribe went to the banian and offered an anangement, promising to make good the loss in eight months. Ibis arrangement they have since repudiated. « His Highness Sayyid Turki has on different occasions been reminded of the matter since his return, but he has not been able to put sufficient pressure on the offending tribe to cause them to make good the lo-s sustained at their hands, or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they have since succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to icply to His Highness until the season opened, and they could get away in their bughlahs. “ It is evident that His Highness has no means of coercing this tribe and enforcing his authority upon them : indeed, his power over the coast of his dominions is at present ex tremely slight, as he has lost the only vessel that once gave a semblance of it. “ His Highness has informed me that he now leaves the matter in the hands of Govern ment, and, as 1 consider that the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them is likely to be injurious to our interests, I trust you will support His Highness's request that the enforcement of reparation may be undertaken by Government. “To hold His Highness personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh's hands would, I respectfully submit, tend still further to weaken His Highness's authority, and would encourage the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at flis Highness's expense; while the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand, be a salutary caution to all.' 580. In forwarding this report to Government, Colonel Prideaux re marked :— “ Since the time when it was possible for Sayyid Turki to redeem his promise of exacting reparation, his difficulties have increased, and 1 am not now prepared to say that he could take effectual measures without our co-operation. There is also some force in Lieute nant-Colonel Miles' argument that, if the refractory tribes find they can plunder with impunity at the Sultan's expense, they will lose no opportunity of doing so. But. before moving actively in the matter, 1 would recommend that His Highness should be called upon to address the Jenebeh again, and to clearly intimate that, in the event of speedy satisfaction not being obtained, he will be compelled to apply to the British Government for assistance in enforcing his demands. I would further recommend that if the Jenebeh do not, wdthin a specified time, which I would fix at three months, accede to the demands of His Highness Sayyid Turki, effective steps should be taken to obtain redress; and that, in addition to the sum of dollars 1,600, which was plundered from the banian, a further sum of dollars 2,000 should be levied, partly as compensation for the delay which has occurred, and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject.' From Goveriunentof India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 2568-R, dated 28th October 1876. Poll. A., November 1876, Nos. 14-27. 587. In reply, Government instructed the Re sident as follows:— “You will convey to His Highness Sayyid Turki an expression of the dissatisfaction of the Government of India that His Highness has failed to exact prompt and adequate satis faction for an outrage committed by subjects of'Oman upon a British subject. “ His Highness Sayyid Turki should vindicate, by promptly punishing those in fault, the reality of his power, which the British Government has supported so liberallv, and His Highness may reasonably be required to exact from the offending tribe the dollars 1,600 plundered from the banian, together with such sum as you may fix by way of additional com pensation for the delay which has occurred in the enforcement of reparation. “ With reference to your proposal that, in the event of the tribe continuing obdurate, the Government of India should coerce them, I am desired to state that the President in Council cannot undertake the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals in the dominion of Maskat. This must be done by the Sultan himself, and the Government of India may fairly expect, in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Sayyid Turki the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy, and for other material aid which has been afforded to His Highness from time to time, that the punishment of offenders in 'Oman will be effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects are concerned without requisitions being made on the I ritish Government for armed intervention.' From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 283, dated 30 th December 1876. Poll. A., February 1877, Nos. 130-138. 588. Sayyid Turki, in a letter to the Politi cal Agent, excused himself as follows:-— 140I H I ^- 4 “You are aware that what happened concerning Jethanund's property occurred as a theft, and the several parties implicated are of different and various clans. I have repeatedly written to the chiefs of the clans, and they have offered to deliver up the offenders, but to this 1 have not consented, but have demanded of them full restitution; the culprits, according to the statements of the chiefs, being penniless. At present the boats of the offending clans are scattered and their people are not in Soor, but when they assemble I will, if God please, enforce reparation and take measures that Jethanund's loss be made good to him.” 589. On 8th February 1877, Government di rected the Resident to— From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 255-P, dated 8th February 1877. Poll. A., February 1877, Nos. 130-138. “ bring to the notice of the Sultan of Maskat the desire of the Government of India that His Highness should take early measures for the settlement of the ease, which has been long delayed.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 50, dated 3rd March 1877. Poll. A., Ap’d 1877, Nos. 203-294. From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 89, dated 6th April 1877. Poll. A., October 1877, Nos. 219-237. “ His Highness has intimated to me that on receipt of your letter regarding the plunder of the banian Jethanund at Soor, he wrote to the Wali of that town to call upon the Jenebeh tribe to make immediate reparation for the outrage committe 1 by them, and to threaten them, in the event of non-compliance, with the seizure of their ships after the opening of the next Season. “As the Jenebeh tribe are now scattered, and none of the principal men are to be found at Soor, His Highness had intended to wait until the trading season was over, and the bughlahs had collected there for the monsoon, before moving in this matter, but, in conse quence of your letter, he determined upon despatching orders at once.” , 590. This Colonel Prideaux did by a letter to Sayyid Turki, who replied that he had writ ten to the Wali of Soor to carry out the orders issued by the Government of India. Colonel Miles at the same time wrote to the Resident:— 591. On 7th June Government inquired :— From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 1313-P, dated 7th June 1877. Poll. A, June 1877, Nos. 180-181. “ whether the early measures which His Highness Sayyid Turki was desired to adopt have produced the desired effect,” failing which the Resident was directed to “ call upon His Highness to demand from the Jeuebeh tribe compensation, both for the original outrage and for the delay in settlement, and to take whatever steps may be necessary to make the tribe clearly understand that reparation, if not yielded to the demand of the Sultan of Maskat, will be enforced with further penalties direct by the British Government.” 592. Colonel Prideaux instructed the Acting Political Agent: — “to wait upon His Highness Sayyid Turki, and ascertain whether any effect has yet been given to the orders which His Highness informed me in his letter of the 28th March 1877 he had despatched to his Wali at Soor.” 593. On 8th July Mr. Robertson telegraphed:— “ In interview with Sultan regarding indemnity for plunder of Hindu trader at Soor by Jenebeh, His Highness stated that his orders to people of Soor had been without effect. He has again written to Beni Bu Ali tribe to exact compensation, but has little confidence in result. He suggests that mere presence of British man-of-war at Soor would probably cause immediate payment.” 591. Colonel Prideaux suggested that the Poli tical Agent should be authorized to proceed in H.M.S. Teazer to Soor and convey the Sultan’s demands. Government having sanctioned this course, the Resident telegraphed to Mr. Ro bertson : — Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern ment of India, No. 174, dated 9th July 1877. Poll. A., October 1877, Nos. 219-237. Government of India to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 1681-P, dated 14th July 1877. Poll.

If tribe refuse compliance arrange to blockade fort, or, if prac ticable without violence, disable native craft in port by removing masts or rudders: then telegraph for further instructions.” 141595. On 31st July Mr. Robertson reported bis proceedings as follows:— Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern* ment of India, No. 205, dated 9th August 1877. Poll. A.,October 1877, Nos. 219-239. “ I wrote to His Highness Sayyid Turk! informing him of the instructions I had received and requesting him to furnish me with a written order to the Jenebeh to pay me the sums I had been directed to recover from them. « When I called on the Sultan before leaving, it was proposed that the Minister, Sayyid Said, should accompany me, as His Highness's iiepesentative and to act as a go-between, to which I readily assented. « Qa arriving at Soor on the 24th, I wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Highness's order, and warning them that i*f they failed to comply with it within twenty-four hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. “ The Jenebeh have no recognized head, their nominal Shaikh being a boy who is as yet without authority. Several of the leading men came on board the Teazer in reply to my letter. They expressed their readiness to comply with His Highness's order, but explained that the absence of a recognized authority among them rendei*ed it necessary for each member of the tribe to pav his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of re-imbursement after our departure would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland lighting with the Beni Bu Hasan, they asked for an extension of time, and I allowed them until sunset on the 25th. « Early next morning Sayyid Said went on shore. He returned at mid-day and reported that Jethanund’s claim, amounting to dollars 1,600, had been satislied, partly by a money pay ment, and partly by a bughlah, of which he had received possession. “ At sunset the Governor of Soor and Jethanund came on board. The former delivered to me dollars 2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied. Regarding the disposal of the fine I solicit the favour of your instructions.' Government of Iiulia to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 2323-P, dated 9tb October 1877. Poll. A„ October 1877, Nos. 219-237. 596. Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained, and directed that the fine of dol lars 2,000 should he paid to Sayyid Turki, after deduction of the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 597. Prevention by Sayyid Turki of the shipment at Maskat of Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Negroes for sale at Reunion. —On 26th April 1877 ot lndia ’ N ° 112&gt; dated 4th 1877, Colonel Miles, in a despatch to Her Majesty’s Poll, a., July 1877 , Nos. 154 - 158 . Secretary of State for foreign alfairs, reported u A French schooner, the Clemence, Captain Mahe, recently arrived at this port from Reunion, with the supposed intention of taking in a cargo of produce aud^Negroes for sale in that colony. “ Mr. Consul Perry, of Reunion, to whom I am indebted for having given me early intimation regarding Captain Mahe's intentions, informed me that if the Negroes were ob tained, they would probably be shipped as passengers or entered in such a way that their po sition would be apparently regular. “ On receipt of Mr. Perry's note I communicated the suspicious character of this vessel confidentially to His Highness Sayyid Turki, who took steps to prevent Negroes being taken on board of her under any pretence, and also sent injunctions to this effect to the chiefs, along the 'Oman coast. The Clemence sailed from this on the 18th instant, without having succeeded, as far as 1 know, in shipping any seedies. “ It is not the first time that the French have endeavoured to obtain Negroes here. Some 13 months ago Captain Finet, of the French barque Dec!dee, engaged eight men as coolies to work, under an engagement for five years at Reunion, by promises of liberal wages and treatment and he had already shipped them previous to sailing, when His Highness the Sultan, on hearing my suggestion as to the real nature of the treatment they would probably experience, refused his permission to their departure and caused them to be relanded.' Government of India to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 1540-P, dated 29th June 1877. Poll. A., July 1877, Nos. 154-158. 598. Government directed that the thanks of the Governor-General in Council should he conveyed to Sayyid Turki for the action be had taken in this matter. 599- Withdrawal of Sayyid Beder bin Saif from Sokar : his im- 1T2prisonment at Maskat, and deportation to Zanzibar.—When Sayyid „ ,. . Turki elected Savyid Ibrahim bin Kais from Sohar, paragiap i in January 1873, he appointed Sayyid Beder bin Saif, his connection and adherent, Wali, with jurisdiction over the coast from Lamah to Khaboorah. Up to September 1877 their relations continued satis factory, Sayyid Beder giving proof, whenever occasion presented itself, of his locality to the Sultan, but his rule appears to have become gradually oppressive and distasteful to the people. 600. On the 27th September 1877 Mr. Robertson reported:— ct His Highness has informed me that, in consequence of numerous complaints of oppres- „ * n sion from the people of Sohar, he is anxious to remove the ment of India, No. 239, dated 4th Governor, Sayyid Beder bin Saif. He apprehends that October 1877. Sayyid Beder, if made aware of his intention, may resist, and Poll. A.,November 1879, Nos. 191-215. h as therefore written to him to come to Maskat on the plea that his mediation will facilitate a settlement of difficulties with the Shaikiyeh tribes. Sayyid Beder has replied that, if his presence at Maskat be absolutely necessary, he will come, but that the attitude of the Naim Bedouins renders it advisable that he should not leave Sohar just now. His Highness asked me what should be done if Beder resisted his authority. I replied that it was a point on which I could not undertake to advise him, but that the former services of Sayyid Beder and his family appeared to me to entitle him to much consideration and no hasty judgment.^ 601. On 22nd November the Acting Political Agent again wrote : — Numerous complaints of oppression against Sayyid Beder bin Saif, at present Governor of Sohar, have induced His Highness to decide upon removing Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- him. With this object in view, His Highness has written to cember^lS??' 8 ' 270, lbt ^ Sayyid Beder, from time to time during the last two mouths, to come to Maskat, but Sayyid Beder continues to make excuses and his ultimate compliance seems doubtful.” 602. Sayyid Beder finally arrived at Maskat in December, and was forth with imprisoned in one of the forts. Ahmed bin Hamad, Wali of Burka, was appointed Wali of Sohar, and proceeded thither, accompanied by Sayyid Turki’s eldest son, Muhammad. Their arrival and Sayyid Beder’s dismissal were reported to have given general satisfaction to the inhabitants of Sohar and adjacent tribes. 603. On 7th March 1878 Colonel Miles wrote :— “ Sayyid Beder bin Saif, whose imprisonment in Maskat Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- b F His Highness Sayyid Turki was reported by Mr. Ro- ment of India, No. 45, dated 15th bertson in his letter No. 446, dated 6th December 1877, was March 1 8 78. released and sent down by mail steamer to Zanzibar on the Poll. A., February 18S0, Nos. 34o-360. lst ins1ant (i In a conversation I had with His Highness lately, T took occasion to mention my regret at hearing that Sayyid Beder had fallen under his displeasure, and said I was sure that in deal ing with him His Highness would not forget the faithful and important services Sayyid Beder and his father, Sayyid Saif, had rendered on numerous occasions. “ His Highness observed that the complaints of the people of Sohar against Sayyid Be- der\s oppression had been many and loud, and that he had reason to believe that Sayyid Beder had entertained the idea of retaining possession of Sohar, and making himself independent. “ It is not unlikely the rule of Sayyid Beder at Sohar was injudicious, and that he com mitted petty exactions there, but, so far as I can learn, there has been no great harm done. The Arabs are a people who are very well able to take care of themselves. The reasons for His Highness's suspicions about the fidelity of Sayyid Beder are unknown to me. r ‘ I think His Highness Sayyid Turki will find some day that he has been somewhat hasty in getting rid of one who has proved himself to bo among his staunchest and most valuable adherents. I believe Sayyid Beder’s disgrace is due solely to the, in this instance, pernicious advice and influence of the Minister, Sayyid Said, who has sought to gratify his own feelino-s of enmity rather than advance His Highness Sayyid Turki's interests.” 604. Landing of a cargo of Abyssinian slaves near Maseerah: U3144 the Political Agent’s visit to the island. —On 2nd September 1876 Colonel Resident. Persian Gulf, to Govern- Miles reported the receipt of information that a Sep^mbeMSTG.^ 0 ’ 203 ’ datcd 1&lt;&gt;th bughlah, having on board 80 Abyssinian slaves, had Poll, a., August 1877, Nos. 19-31. arrived from the Red Sea at Mukalla, and left that place 12 days before, bound, it was supposed, for ’Oman or the Persian Gulf. At the Political Agent’s request, H.M.S. Arab cruised for some days to intercept the slaver, but failed to do so. On 18th November Colonel Miles telegraphed :— Cargo of Abyssinian slaves has been landed at Maseerah Island and about two-thirds Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- l,ave be en sold. As these slaves are free by treaty, and as ment of India. No. 285, dated 30th Sultan is powerless to cause their release, being without vessel, December 1876. would Government approve of man-of-war proceeding o. Augu s os. - . Maseerah to demand surrender of these Abyssinians and to in flict fine to amount of double the estimated value of those not surrendered ? An officer de puted by Sultan could accompany vessel, and a refusal on part of Shaikh to give up slaves or pay fine could be met by seizure and retention of his boats until submission. I believe this measure would have a more deterrent effect on the trade than the capture at sea of several slave dhows.” 605. Colonel Prideaux, in submitting to Government these views and sug gestions, wrote: — “ As regards the chief of Maseerah Island, who permitted the slaves to he landed, I am of opinion that, if His Excellency in Council thinks it right to impose any punishment upon him he must be dealt with by us independently of the Sultan of Maskat. His Highness has no vessel at his disposal and cannot consequently enforce his authority on the island. If a man- of-war visited Maseerah and inflicted a heavy fine upon the chief it would, I believe, have an excellent effect.” 606. On 30th March 1877, Colonel Miles further reported :— Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern ment of India, No. 90, dated 6ih April 1877. “ Mith the exception of a small portion of the cargo that belonged to a Persian, and was carried by him for sale to the Persian coast, the whole of the remainder has been distri buted and disposed of in '’Oman ” 607. The instructions issued to the Resident were as follows :— “ The Govenu.ent 'f India approves your suggestion that the island of Maseerah should Government of India, to Resident, visited by a British ship-of-war and a fine be inflicted on Persian Gulf, No. 1717-P., dated 17th the chief. But the penalty imposed should be moderate, and J ”ron.T;A»gu.t 1877. No,. 19 . 31 . forced after communication and in agreement with the oultan ot Maskat. I am to request that you will take the necessary measures to give effect to these instructions.” 608. The Acting Resident, Major Grant, directed the Acting Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Agent to COUSUlt with Sllltan RS to tllC amount of fine which should be imposed on the Chief of Maseerah, and as to the best time and manner of ment of India, No. 229, dated 22nd September 1877. Poll. A., December 1877, Nos. 199-204. levying it. 609.

It is desirable that he should avail himself of this opportunitv to inquire into tin circumstances of the landing of the slaves, and, if he considers that the justice of the casi does not require the imposition of a fine, but would be sufficiently met by a warniixr fie Go vernment of India would be prepared to accept his conclusion.” ‘ 0 ’* &gt; &gt; 610. On 6th December, Mr. Robertson reported his proceedings as fol lows : — “I left Maskat for Maseerah in H.M.S. Arab on the 24th ultimo, accompanied by Musellim bin Bedui of the Beni Ruahah on behalf Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- 0 f His Highness Sa 3 ’yid Turki. On arriving at the village ment of India, No. 283, dated 15th 0 £ Um-Errasas I landed with Captain Dicken, and found December 18/7. t j ie p 0vert y 0 f the place and its inhabitants had not been exaggerated at Maskat. The village consists of about sixty huts built of date branches, but several of them are deserted. The people live entirely by fishing, having neither cattle nor cultivation. There is a small clump of date trees at the upper end of the Bay, but it belongs to the Shaikh of the Jenebeh, who lives on the mainland and rarely visits the island. With this exception the island is entirely barren, as I saw from the top of a hill, which stands behind the village. “ The villagers spread a mat for us and I told them why we had come. They said that the bughlah had anchored at the entrance of the bay, but had landed no sla\es^ on the island, although slaves might have been sent in her boats to the mainland opposite. ^ They swore that they had bought none of them, and pointed out, what indeed seemed obvious enough, that their collective wealth was insufficient to purchase a single Abyssinian. I questioned them at some length to ascertain if their boats had assisted in conveying the slaves to places on the coast, but it did not appear that they had done so. “Judging by the destitute appearance of the people, it seemed to me that the smallest pecuniary penalty would prove irrecoverable, and neither the strength of the case against them nor my instructions, appeared to justify the infliction of punishment by^ destroying boats or huts. I warned the islanders that if slaves were again landed in their neighbourhood, and they failed to give notice of it, they should be held responsible and punished for the old and the new offence at the same time. They appeared to be impressed, and I trust that you will consider that 1 did what was best and all that was advisable under the circumstances/’ 611. The Resident in submitting the Acting Political Agent’s report wrote :— « I think that Mr. Robertson has acted with judgment and discretion, and, as Ids decision in the case is in accordance with the instructions of Govermuent, 1 have no hesitation in re commending it for approval and confirmation.” 612—Sayyid Abdul Aziz removes from Seined to Jaalan: decision of Government that the orders in force, regarding aid allowable to the Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Sultan against Other lehelS, apply t0 him . leads a force of 300 Bedouins against Maskat hut fails to advance beyond Semail: returns to live at Semed—On 27th September 1877 the Acting Political Agent re- inent of India, No. 239, dated 4th Oetober 1877. Poll. A., November 1879, Nos. 191-245. ported :— “ Sayyid Abdul Aziz has been on a visit to Shaikh Salih bin AH at Ibrah, in company with Shaikh Hamood El Jehafi of the A1 Wahibah Bedouins. They are reported to have discussed various plans for harassing the Government of Maskat, Shaikh Salih being in favour of a descent on Soor, while Sayyid Abdul Aziz advocated an expedition against Maskat itself, and Hamood a raid in El Batinah. They appear, however, to have come to no agree ment for immediate action, and Sayyid Abdul Aziz returned to Semed on the 15th instant.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 238, dated 4th October 1877. Poll A., N ovember 1879, Nos. 191-245. 613. On the 1st October Air. Robertson tele graphed :— “ Sayyid Abdul Aziz gone Jaalan to Beni Bn Hasan tribe. Supposed that he will try to get possession of Soor. Sultan says he has reason to think Abdul Aziz would now accept former offer of 500 dollars per mensem on condition his residing in India. Asks that I may be channel of communication, if negotiations to this end opened.” And on the 3rd :— “ It is reported that Abdul Aziz has few followers now, but is promised help by various tribes when insurrection is begun.” To the former of these telegrams the Acting Resident, Major Grant, replied:— “ If both His Highness Sayyid Turki and Sayyid Abdul Aziz wish you to mediate 145between them, you may g-ive good offices as directed in Colonel Ross’s telegrams to Colonel Miles, dated 26th, 27th February, and 2nd March 1876.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 245, dated Q n UtR October, Ml*. Robertson Wrote I — ] 8th October 1877. Poll. A., November 18/9, Nos. 191-245. a News reached Maskat on the 28th ultimo that Sayyid Abdul Aziz had left Semed a second time to visit Shaikh Salih bin Ali at Ibrah, whence he was to proceed to Jaalan with Shaikli Amir bin Salim and Rashid bin Jumeea of the Beni 13u Hasan tribe.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 253, dated 10th November 1877. 615. On the 27th October the Acting Politi cal Agent further reported :— “ It appears that Sayyid Abdul Aziz has quite failed to obtain support from the tribes, and that Salih bin Ali, who is himself without influence, has merely used him to create a threatening slate of affairs, from which Salih hoped to reap benefit in re-employment as an agent by His Highness Sayyid Turki. “ Sayyid Abdul Aziz is, as one of the letters expresses it, ‘ at bis wit’s end in the country of the Beni Bn Hasan,’ of Jaalan, and it is not improbable that he may now accept a pension on condition that he retire to India or Zanzibar, which the Sultan has again indirectly offered to him. Should a fitting opportunity occur, 1 shall mediate between the brothers to the ex tent specified in your instructions.” 616. Sayyid Abdul Aziz did not accept the Sultan's offer of terms, or From Resident, Pershm Golf, to request tlie Political A gent to mediate between ]iim Government of India, No. 270 , dated and his brother at tliis time, and, on 22nd November, Mr. Robertson reported :— 1st December 1877. “ Sayyid Abdul Aziz was by last accounts still in Jaalan, the guest of Amir bin Salim of the Beni Bu Hasan. The more important Shaikhs of that tribe have shown no inclination as yet to support him, and the other Hinawi tribes appear at present to wish to remain quiet.’ 617. Efforts were made by the principal Shaikhs of the Beni Ru Ali, and by Shaikh Hamid bin Said of the El Harth, to bring about an arrangement between the Sultan and Sayyid Abdul Aziz, through the Political Agent’s mediation, and, on 20th December, Mr. Robertson wrote :— «It would appear that Sayyid Abdul Aziz is quite ready to entertain proposals for an arrangement with his brother, and thankful for the efforts to From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 297, dated 29tb December 1877. that end, which are being made. His Highness has replied to Shaikh Hamid that Sayyid Abdul Aziz should write to the Political Agent requesting his mediation and appointing a meeting 1 at which the terms of an arrangement might be discussed and settled.” 618. The negotiations on this, as on former occasions, failed owing to Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s determination not to leave ’Oman, and on 3rd January 1878 the Acting Political Agent reported :— Sayyid Abdul Aziz, in a letter to Shaikh Hamid, states that he does not desire to reside in India, hut will live and die in ’Oman, and he recom mends Shaikh Hamid to take no further trouble in regard to him as ‘ Turki’s affair is easy and simple.’ The meaning of tliis last clause is not very clear, but it is probably meant to be a threat. His Highness informs me that he is not inclined to make an allowance to Sayyid Abdul Aziz on any condition other than his retirement from ’Oman, and means to let the matter drop for the present. From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 10, dated 12tb January 1878. 619. In the course of January Sayyid Abdul Aziz visited Shaikh Salih bin Ali at Kabil, but, their views differing, nothing came of the meeting, and Sayyid Abdul Aziz returned to the Beni Bu Hasan. 620. On 5th February Sayyid Turki, in a letter to the Political Agent, From Resident, Persian Gulf, to solicited the aid and support of Government against Government of India, No. 29 , dated Sayyid Abdul Aziz, should the latter succeed in ietb February 18 / 8 . leading a rebel force against Maskat. Colonel Ross, in submitting the application to Government, observed that the point for deci sion was whether Sayyid Abdul Aziz should be regarded as on the same footing 116147 as other leaders of rebellion, such as Ibrahim bin Kais and Salih bin Ali, or in a different light. Having expressed concurrence with a statement of Sayyid Turki that the people of El Sharkiyeh and ’Oman generally did not favour Sayyid Abdul Aziz, and that any rising which he was likely to bring about would be merely a plundering raid, the Eesident proceeded :— “ 1 think, further, that the policy, interests, and prestige of the British Government will now he best served and upheld by maintaining Sayyid Turki in his seat. I am, therefore, most respectfully of opinion that, in case of extremity, an appeal from Sayyid Turki for aid against his brother should be considered in the same way as in the case of other aspirants to power.” 621. Sayyid Abdul Aziz continued to reside with the Beni Bu Hasan in Jaalan. In April it was reported that he had paid a visit to Shaikh Salih bin Ali at Kabil, in company with Shaikh Amir bin Salim and Itashid bin J umeea.

On 12th June Colonel Miles reported : — “ For the last few days the rumour has been gaining ground that the Sharkiyeh tribes have been in a state of ferment, and I believe there is no longer any doubt that a risino* has been organized.” 623. Dissensions among the chiefs caused some delay in the rebel advance, and it was supposed at Maskat that the movement had collapsed, but, on 7 th July, Colonel Miles telegraphed:— “It is now certain Abdul Aziz with Salih and Hinawis have left Sharkiyeh and are From Resident, Persian Gulf, to marching on Maskat Sayyid Turki had given up expecting Government of India, No. 134, dated them and is now absent at Burka. \\ ith his entire cow- 9th July 1878. ^ currence JmiHeft on Thursday for Charbar and Karachi.

On 10th July Colonel Miles wrote:— “ There seems little doubt that Abdul Aziz had reached Semed and is on his way down, but no mention is made of Salih being with him, and it is believed that he has not yet decided tojoin the enterprise in person, though its organization is of course due chiefly to him. “His Highness Sayyid Turki was informed at once by Kossid of the change in the aspect of affairs and returned to Maskat on the Sth instant. On the morning of that day Sayyid Said visited me and requested, on behalf His Highness, that I would write at once to Sayyid Abdul Aziz and desire him to desist from hostilities, representing that it was the general belief that Sayyid Abdul Aziz was under the impression that he would not meet with the opposition of the British Government in his designs against his brother, and stating his conviction that my letter would have the effect of discouraging Abdul Aziz from further operations, “ In view of the interests at slake, and in the absence of a man-of-war, I believed I should be acting in the spirit of the instructions of Government in supporting Sayyid Turki, and that it was advisable, under the circumstances, to comply with the requests, and I therefore wrote to Sayyid Abdul Aziz accordingly.”14,8 was as 626. The Political Agent’s letter to Sayyid Abdul Aziz follows :— “ I have been informed that Your Highness has leagued with certain disaffected persons in El Sharkiyeh, who have risen in rebellion against His Highness Sayyid lurki, and that you are coming to Maskat with hostile intentions. “ I have heard this with regret, for I did not expect such things from Your Highness. “ It is not concealed from you how much the British Government desire the peace happiness, and prosperity of the people of Oman, and are displeased with those who s le j oo wantonly and delight in plunder. “ I have therefore to inform Your Highness that your proceedings are viewed with dis pleasure, and I trust you will not risk the loss of our friendship and incur the angei of the British Government by persisting in the course. And if Your Highness reject my advice, on you rests the responsibility. Salaam.” Sayyid Abdul Aziz replied :— Government of India, No. 152, dated 25th July 1878. “ In an auspicious hour your letter reached me, and what was expressed in it I have un derstood particularly your remark that I have risen against From Resident, Persian Gulf, to jjy brother Turki with the intention of attacking Maskat, and that you have heard this with much regret; also your observations that the British Government desire that the people of 'Oman should have peace and dwell in prosperity, and that they are displeased with those who shed blood wantonly and delight in plunder. “ Be just, and please to inform me in what way my brother Turki has given prosperity, peace, justice, or tranquillity to the people of ’Oman during the time he has reigned. Surely they have not enjoyed them. He has even lost the power of ruling them, and has become neglectful of his subjects until the whole of ’Oman is full of rebellion, sedition, oppression, and disturbance, and the country is now without a ruling hand at all, and without justice and without tranquillity. The people are sheep without a shepherd. The great have no mercy on the small, and the strong show no justice to the weak. This is not according to law and right. It is not concealed from you what has happened between my brother Turki and myself from the beginning to the end, and you are aware that at one time I endeavoured to the best of my ability to improve the state of affairs, and remove troubles, and give security to the persons and prosperity to the people; but it was not possible for us to continue to act together, and he chose to associate with the seditious and misguided men. What happened happened, and I said nothing about it, and remained quiet in my house, and had patience for two years and a half, that perhaps he might change and behave better, and do justice between the people, and give tranquillity to the land and people, and remove discontents. I saw no efforts of his, however, in this direction, and no improvement, and you know what occurred, and your discrimination is sufficient. Then I saw that the whole country of ’Oman was collected to oppose my brother Turki and to advance upon Maskat, and they were not to be turned from it. They desired that I should join them, and if I had declined they would have applied to another to lead them. It would have been disadvantageous to my interests to have allowed this, and what happened last year was sufficient in this way. I therefore considered it advis able to join them, not seeing any other way to gain my ends. And regarding the subjects of the British Government there is no fear for them, and I request you will be good enough to cause them to ship themselves and all their pi-operty, and remain on the sea until everything is settled and quiet, and God is the best disposer of events. I trust the Government will observe neutrality between us, as it is their custom to be just, and my faith in you is complete. Salaam” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 141, dated 16th July 1878. 627. Colonel Itoss thought that the circum stances had demanded the step which the Political Agent took in addressing a warning to Sayyid Abdul Aziz. 62S. On 18th July Colonel Miles telegraphed :— From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 147, dated 19th July 1878. Poll. A., November 1878, Nos. 105 (23-41). “ Abdul Aziz at Semail, with three hundred men, making no progress, is opposed by Ghafiris.

Beyond this nothing seems to have occurred to affect the 629.

Designs of Sayyid Turki against Sayyid Ibrahim bin p , p . r i f f Kais.— Colonel Miles, in reporting on 15th August From Resident, Persian Gulf, to r , 0 iix t&gt; i^ Government of India, No. 173 , dated 1878 that Sayyid Turki had proceeded to liuika 22 nd August 1878. i n pjs yacht and ordered certain Ghafiri tribes of Jaalan and men of Nakhl to join him, wrote :— &lt;c His Highness’s design is to attack the fortress of Ef Hazm, one of the strongest in Oman and now in the hands of Sayyid Ibrahim, and, if unable to capture it, to destroy the trees and watercourses around, and inflict as much damage as possible. His Highness has also endeavoured to intercept the trade with Itostak, and has prohibited the dates and other produce of that district being brought down to the “ These aggressive measures are contrary to the Moofwl policy of Sayyid Turki, and do not appear to me to be at all judicious or well-timed. Sayyid Ibrahim’s rebellion last year would certainly justify any retaliatory operations against him on Sayyid Turki’s part. But His Highness’s feeble tenure of power and inability to take the Held in person do not make it prudent*for him to initiate hostilities against his most powerful rival.” 632. On the 21st August, Colonel Miles further reported :— “ Savyid Turki has returned to Maskat from Barkhan, having abandoned his expedition to El Hazm and dismissed the force he had collected for that From Resident, Persian Gulf, to purpose. His Highness on arriving at Burka and making Government of India, No. 176, dated ; irieS) f oun(1 th at the harvest had all been gathered from J August 10/8. the date trees around E1 H:lzmj and that, moreover, there was a larger force of Hinawis in that neighbourhood than he cared to operate against without receiving further re-inforcements. He therefore paid up and dismissed the Beni Rasib and other Arabs to their homes.” 633. Position of affairs on 1st November 1878— No event or change of much political importance had occurred during the year anterior to this date. The collapse of Sayyid Abdul Aziz’s emeute in July had shown that he was without influential adherents, and disposed of him as an aspirant to the Sultanate for a time. Shaikh Salih bin Ali had not regained the influence lost in 1877. Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais was holding aloof from faction and intrigue in retire ment at Rostak. The Sultan had appointed his eldest son, Muhammad, Wali of Sohar. 634. Submission of Shaikhs Amir bin Salih, Rashid bin Jumeea Hamood El Jahafi and his brother Ali bin Said to the Sultan.—On 2nd January 1879, Colonel Miles reported:— “ The two Shaikhs of the Beni Bu Hasan tribe, Amir bin S ilim and Kashid bin Jumeea who were released from confinement in Fort Merani at the same time with Shaikh Hamood bin Said El Jahafi, in 1876,* and who have ever since been intriguing with Sayyid Abdul Aziz and Salih bin Ah to raise a rebellion in El Sharkiyeh, have arrived at Maskat to make submission to His From Resilient, Persian Gulf, to Go vernment of India, No. 22, dated 14tli January 1879.

On 27tli February the Political Agent further reported Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern ment o( India, Xo. 106, dated 7th March 1879. Poll.

Sayyid Turki’s desires (I) to place a Maskat Agent at Bandar Abbass, and (II) to lease that port and its dependencies from Persia. On 30tli January 1878 Colonel Miles reported:— From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, No. 82, dated 23rd February 1879. Poll. A, June 1879, Nos. 31-36. « The Wazir Sayyid Said, during a recent conversation with me, mentioned that His Highness Sayyid Turki was anxious to have an agent residing at Bandar Abbass, and solicited my views and opinion on the subject.” “ Sayyid said that the position of His Highness's subjects at Bandar Abbass, of whom there was a considerable number, engaged in trade and other occupations, was not altogether satisfactory, as the treatment received by them at the hands of the Persian authorities and the protection afforded them in their dealings with others were not such as His Highness con- sidered they ought to be, and it was thought the establishing an agent at that port would be beneficial to the interests of all 'Oman subjects in Southern Persia. “ I said that, if the Sultan desired it, I should be happy to communicate his wishes in the matter to you for the favour of your advice, and the Minister replied that His Highness would be much obliged by my doing so.” 638. Colonel Ross addressed Government on tlie subject as follows:— “I understand that His Highness contemplates his proposed agent should have a recoo-nized official status, as regards the Persian and other Governments, and it appears to me this is not without difficulties and objections. There is nothing m Sayyid Turki's relations with the British or any other Government to actually debar from direct diplomatic dealings with Persia, but, as a matter of fact, the rulers of Maskat have of late chosen to entrust their interests in Persia to the British Government. As a Slate in intimate friendly relations with our Government, and unrepresented in Persia, it has been the piactice for the Resident in the Persian Gulf to give good offices to Maskat subjects on the Persian Coast. It appears to me that, as the Sultan would not be represented at the Court of Persia, his proposed151 agent at Bandar Abbas would necessarily have to rely on the support of the British local re presentative, ami His Highness would not be in any better position to protect the interests of his subjects than now. I am of opinion that any subjects of Maskat, who may reside or call at Bandar Abbass, are not exposed to any remarkable inconveniences, and are in fact as favourably treated as British subjects. “ I think that Sayyid Turki's idea should be discouraged, but I would solicit the orders of His Excellency in Council before replying decidedly. “ It appears from a letter addressed by His Highness Sayyid Turki to the Residency Confidential News Agent that His Highness desires and hopes to obtain a lease of Bandar Abbass, but iu my opinion there are insuperable obstacles in the way of that arrangement. ,, 639. On 27th February Colonel Miles further reported :— “ His Highness Sayyid Turki has sent a telegram From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- through his Wazir Sayyid Said to the Shah’s Government March' 1 187t/''^' a&gt; N °' 101 ’ &lt;th at Teheran, soliciting the lease of Bandar Abbass on the same Poll.

(2) H is Highness’s desire to obtain a renewal of the lease by Persia to Maskat of the port of Bandar Abbass and its dependencies. “ With reference to the first point I am to say that Sayyid Turki may be informed that there is no objection on the part of the British Government to his sending an agent to Bandar Abbass in view to the protection of the interests of Maskat subjects at that port. The Governor General in Council observes, however, that when H.M’s legation in Persia was endeavouring in December 1871 to arrange for the lease of Bandar Abbass to Maskat, the makes it difficult to offer any advice upon the subject; and I am to desire that His High ness Sayyid Turki may be informed accordingly, and that it may be explained to him that the admission of a Maskat agent at Bandar Abbass must rest with the Persian Government. “ The matter of the Sultan’s wish to obtain a renewal of the lease of Bandar Abbass does not call for any remarks at present from the Government of India.” 641. Sayyid Turki appears to have let both matters drop. 642. Payments of From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 230, dated 28th .June 1879. Poll. A., October 1879, Nos. 176-182.

Zanzibar subsidy made monthly instead of quarterly.— In June 1879 Sayyid Turki addres sed to the Political Agent a request that the Zan zibar subsidy might be paid to him by monthly instead of quarterly instalments. The application was submitted by the Resident with a request for favourable consideration, and acceded to by Gov ernment. 643. Sayyid Abdul Aziz bin Thowainee arrested at Burka, im prisoned at Maskat and deported at Lingah: refusal of Sayyid Turki to grant him an allowance. —The previous history of Sayyid Abdul Aziz Bin Tliowainee, so far as it appears in the reports of the Maskat Agency, is given in paragraphs b09 and 550-552 of this precis. 614. On 3rd June 1879, Colonel Miles wrote : — “ Sayyid Abdul Aziz biu Thowainee, who is said to have been causing trouble and152 mischief at Henjnm and other places in the Gulf lately, has been brought to Maskat from Burka, and has been confined by the Suftan in Fort Merani. I have obtained an assurance from the Sultan, through the Wazir, that the young man is being properly treated, and that no harm is intended him. His Highness informs me that he intend” sending Abdul Aziz to Zanzibar by the next mad steamer.” From Itesiilpnt, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, No. 206, dateu 11th June 1879. Poll.

Sayvid Turki, while expressing readiness to do whatever the Resident considered right, was obviously disinclined to comply with either request, and Colonel Ross did not think there was reason to press him. 647. Ill-feeling between Sayyid Turki’s El Hasa and El Nejd T , « r r Troops: murder of the Hassawi Chief by a Nejdl.-On 9th October 1879 Major Smith reported October 1879. __ that an imfriendlv feeling of some months standing Poll, a., Nov. 1879, Nos. 255-261. p etween the bodies of El Hasa and El Nejd men • whom Sayyid Turki entertained for the defence of Maskat and Mattrali, had culminated in the murder of the chief of the former, Abdurrahman El Ashkar, by one of the latter, under the following circumstances :— “ On Sunday morning the parties paraded at an early hour at the Sultan’s palace for the purpose of being mustered. While this was iu progress, it seems that the old recriminatipus between them recommenced. The body of the Hasawis, however, quitted the palace without any outbreak occurring, leaving behind them their chief with a small number &lt;&gt;f followers, as well as Mubarak Wallad Shubaika, a Nejdi leader with a much larger following. As Abdur rahman El Ashkar was on the point of leaving the palace, one of his attendants preceded him, and, on emerging into the street outside the gate, was at once cut down by the sword of a -Nejdi, who had waited outside for that purpose. Abdurrahman, on hearing the noise outside, hurried forward to see what was the mattei, and while bending over the body of his wounded adherent he was fired at from behind and received several mortal wounds, from which he almost immediately expired.” 648. Major Smith thought it probable that a conflict between the Hasawis and Nejdis might occur at any moment in the streets of Maskat, and tele graphed to the Resident to request that a man of war might he directed to remain at Maskat until further advice. Colonel Rose requested the commander of Her Majesty’s Ship “ Beacon ” to comply with Major Smith’s requisitions, although himself of opinion that the Sultan would “ be able to control his guards and deal with the difficulty.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go vernment of India, No. 374, dated 30th October 1879.

The respective chiefs informed me that the dispute has been settled : but I thought it advisable to point out to both parties that the quarrels between themselves could not be admitted as a pretext for closing natural harbours against lawful traders. cl I have obtained a promise from each party not in any way to close their harbours iu future and to offer no impediment to vessels using them to obtaining provisions and water. a These promises are embodied in letters addressed to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, which letters 1 beg to enclose herewith.” From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 2G05-E.

Major Smith urged that he should be authorized to comply with this request, on the ground that it would be a good thing to rid Maskat of such an evil-doer, who, if dealt with by the Sultan, would no doubt soon he at large again. 658. Colonel Bose, however, was of opinion that— “As the Consular Jurisdiction Act only provides for the exercise of jurisdiction over British subjects and persons included in that category, the trial and disposal of a charge against a subject of the Sultan of Maskat in your Court would not be strictly legal, and it would, for this and other reasons, be unadvisable to accede to His Highness’s request.” From Government of India to Real- 659.

If, however, you would now treat the matter differently, I am to request the early submission of your views in writing.” 661. Colonel Ross, in directing the Acting Political Agent at Maskat to furnish him, after perusal of the correspondence and consultation with the Sultan, with a careful opinion on the whole question, observed: “ There appear to be three courses open, viz .— “ (1) To carry out at once Mr. Robertson^s original recommendations. “ (2j To exact the indemnity from the Sultan. ‘ (8) To await a favourable and convenient opportunity for exacting retribution from the offending tribes or leaders.” 662. Major Smith recommended the first of these courses, urging, among other reasons, that— From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, No. 423, dated 12th December 1879. Poll. A., February 1880, Nos. 212- 233. “the Sultan has never re-entered into friendly relations with them. The pensions of the ringleaders formerly paid by His Highness have since the occurrence been withheld, and although overtures for reconciliation have been made by them His Highness has never acceded to them.” In regard to this he was, as appeared later, misinformed. 663. Major Smith at the same time submitted for consideration a detail ed scheme of action, and a notification for issue to all the tribes of Oman. Of the former of these Colonel Ross approved, and telegaphed to Government From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- erument of India, No. 422, dated 12th December 1879. Poll. A., February 1880, Nos. 212-233. I would recommend immediate adoption of measures proposed in my memorandum of 8th December 1877. This opinion is in concert with Political Agent, Maskat, who has submitted a full report and detailed proposals which seem judicious and appropriate. Main features fixing total indemnity at 10,000, 2,000 to be imposed on Salih bin Ali personally, 4,000 on Hijrien, rest on Harth and Haboos tribes. Demand for payment to be addressed by Sultan and Political Agent, and simultaneous embargo laid on property of offenders at Soor and Maskat.

It is understood that presence of British gun-boat at Soor is ouly aid requisite.” /C^155 \ V 664. On 21st December 1879 Colonel Ross telegaphed to the Acting Poli tical Agent to carry out the measures authorized, imposing dollars 7,500 on the tribes and dollars 1,500 on Shaikh Salih bin Ali, but at this juncture, and before any effect had been given to these instructions, Major Smith was trans ferred to Kandahar. Sayyid Turk! consequently requested, and Colonel Ross recommended, that action should be postponed until September. Government assented and intimated— From Government of India to Resi. “Orders on question of notification to tribes deferred dent, Persian Gulf, No. 33-E. P., dated pending- your written proposals.

If the offenders do not pay up within the mouth, I would propose to increase the demands at the rate of, say, one per tent, for every month of further delay.” Notification. “ Under orders of the Government of India I have to notify to you as follows :— « You are aware that when you took part in the insurrection against His Highness Sayyid Turki in June 1877, the Political Agent of the Government of India warned you, before your arival at Mattra and Maskat, of ill consequences which would follow if you persisted in your intention of attacking those places. He gave you distinct warning that you would be held responsible by the Government for losses or injuries to British subjects in consequence of your proceedings. “ Disregarding the warning, you persisted in attacking Mattrah and Maskat, and caused unjust and needless loss to British subjects. “The Government of India, having had under consideration the circumstances attending these losses, and the extent of them, have decided that the insurgent chiefs and tribes shall be held liable for the following shares :— “ Shaikh Sali bin Ali . “ Hizrieen Tribe “ K1 Harth Tribe “El Harboos Tribe Dollars, 1,500 3.750 2.750 1,000 « According V, His Highness Sayyid Turki has now been authorized to demand and receive these sums as reparation for the losses of British subjects, and you are hereby informed that His Highness iu doing so acts with the full consent and support of the British Govern ment. You will, therefore, act wisely by immediately arranging for payment of the sum for which you are held responsible, and arrangements will be made for the safe conduct of your messengers coming to the coast to make the payment. “ If paid within one mouth from receipt of this notice, the sum indicated will be accepted as full reparation, and a paper will be given acquitting you from further liability. But if not paid within one month, you will be held liable in such further increased amount as may be decided by Government.” “ (Sd.) E. C.

The replies of Shaikh Salih bin Ali and the tribes to the Sultan and Political x\gent were ineifi(*iently translated by the Maskat ollice, and their purport misunderstood by Dr. Brereton. Colonel Boss, in sending amended translations of them to Major Grant, who succeeded Dr. Brereton, summed them up as follows :— “ Shaikh Salih requests His Highness to appoint a person to confer with him, and, I observe, states that he had personally paid sums to indemnify losers. Hoosaiu bin Muhammad of the El Harth states that the Kl Burwani Section of that tribe were not implicated in the insurrection of lb77. Hilal bin Sayd and Beder bin Muhammad of the El Hijrieen assert that their proceedings were condoned, and a friendly settlement eflected with the Sultan. The Haboos is the only tribe which has replied direct to the OHieiating Political Agent, to whom they state their readiness to comply with the demands of the Sultan. “ It was understood that no reconciliation had taken place since the insurrection between H is H ighness and any of the chiefs and tribes concerned in it.” Major Grant replied— “ With regard to the statements of Hilal bin Sayd Hijree and Deter bin Mohammed Hijree, _, _ n n that their conduct had been condoned by Ilis Highness From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- . , m i • i c • n i.i , • i vemment of India, No. 88, dated 8th bayyid 1 urki, and a friendly settlement arrived at between April 1880. them and him, His Highness admitted that these two Shaikhs Poll.

Poll. A., July 1880, Nos. 104-108 place.' 6G8. Colonel Ross concurred in the view expressed by Major Grant. The decision of Government was as follows :— From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, No. 2208-E. P., dated 6th July 1880. Poll. A., July 1880, Nos. 104-108. “ As the notification has been issued and acknowledged by the tribes, His Excellency in Council is of opinion that it must now be followed up by the proceeding necessary to give effect to it. “ It will therefore be necessary to signify to His Highness the Sultan that, for the reasons above stated, the alternative lies between His Highness taking such steps, with our support as may be necessary and expedient for obtaining payment, or undertaking the payment himself. It is understood that, in the event of the first course being adopted, the active support which will be required from Government will not be more than that of the presence of a vessel of war at Soor at the time of making the demand ; and it appears to His Excellency in Council tbit with this aid and with the advice of the Political Agency, His Highness should without difficulty he able to arrange for the recovery of the money, by instalments if necessary, from the tribes. Should the Sultan, however, elect for the second course, it will probably be the arrangement to recover the money from him by instalments from the Zanzibar subsidy.” 669. Major Grant, having been directed to ascertain the Sultan’s intentions, thus described them :— “ Everything is to he kept quiet until about the first week in September, then, as soon as From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- His Highness's emissaries report that the produce of the tribes venmient of India, No. 182, dated has arrived in considerable quantities at Soor and Mattrah, 27 th September 1880. ^ ^ the Dar Es Salam, accompanied by one of H.M/s skips, Poll, a.,F ebruary 1881, Nos. 10o-ll9. w j]} p roC eed to the former place, and seize a suflicient quantity of produce to cover the amount of the indemnity to be paid by the Hijrieen, whilst His Highness will attach the produce of the other tribes lying at Mattrah. “ His Highness could suggest no plan by which the amount of the fine to he exacted from Salih bin Ali could be recovered, as he does not export produce from any port in 'Oman, and has no property near the coast which could be attached.”670. In pursuance of the above plan the Sultan despatched Sayyid Beder bin Saif on the 16th September, in Ids yacht the l)ar Et* Salaam, to Soor, to seize produce of the Hijrieen tribe which it was reported had arrived at that place. Major Grant also proceeded thither in II.M.S. Woodlark. f ihe information on which the Sultan had acted proved to have been incorrect. They found no produce belonging to the Ilijricen at Soor, and learned that trade cominunica- tion with the interior had been interrupted for some time by intertribal hostili ties. 671. Subsequent negotiations between the Sultan and the tribes resulted in an arrangement that all El Sharkiyeh dates brought to Mattrah and Soor for exportation should pay a special tax of one dollar per bahar until such time as the sum so raised liquidated the indemnity claim. 672. Government consented to the gradual recovery of the indemnity from ^he tribes in the manner proposed. 673. Position of affairs on 1st January 1880 —The year 1879 was uneventful in ’Omau. The general position of affairs underwent no change. 674. Sayyid Turki’s project of purchasing Thumb Island from „ n , tne Deputy Governor of Lingah.— On 21st Ja- Go^rmcut of'naua, er No n 23 , U dated nuary 1880 Dr. Brereton, Acting Political Agent, 29 th January 1830 . reported that Sayyid Turki had opened negotia- p oU' A '’ teby ' 1880, Nos ' 340 ' 312 ' tions with Shaikh Yusuf, Deputy Governor of Lin gah, for the purchase of Thumb Island, near that place, and desired to know whether the Deputy Governor had powder to dispose of the island without the Shah’s sanction. Colonel Hoss replied that Shaikh Yusuf would have no power or right to dispose of the island without the sanction of the Government of Persia, which it was wholly improbable would be granted. 675. Remittance of $3,0S4 4 by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the , . n n Political Agent, Maskat, for Sayyid Abdul Jr o foTMi; r^ G 5ldi®h Aziz. — 'I ii May 1880, the Sultan of Zanzibar re- June issa mitted, through the Political Agent there, $8,061J roll, a , July isso, Nos. 86-87. ^ the Political Agent, Maskat, for delivery to Sayyid Abdul Aziz, as his share of estates of deceased brothers. Sayyid Turki requested Major Grant not to pay the entire sum to Sayyid Abdul Aziz at once, but to allow him $100 monthly until the date season, when the balance remaining might be handed to him. Government authorized the adoption of this course, considering that— From Government of India, to Resi dent, Persian Gulf, telegram dated 7th June 1880. money should not be paid to Abdul Aziz in’Oman by Political Agent without concurrence of Turki.” ’Oman. 676. Sayyid Abdul Aziz declined to receive the money by instalments. Colonel Boss, therefore, proposed, and Government sanctioned, its retention by the Political Agent un til the date season had begun, when it might he paid in a lump sum without danger to the peace of From Government of India, to Resi. dent, Persian Gulf, No, 2827-E. P., dated 18th August 1880. Poll. A., August 1880, Nos. 170-177. 677. In October, Sayyid Turki still objecting to the money being paid to his brother in one sum, Sayyid Abdul Aziz addressed to Colonel Boss a re quest that he might receive instalments of $200 instead of $100 monthly, Sayyid Turki consenting, arrears for five months at this rate when paid by the Political Agent to Sayyid Abdul xVziz, and the balance by monthly instalments of $200.A. 1 678. Payment for gunpowder supplied to Sayyid Turki from From Government of Indm, to Res!- tllC Bombay ArSCUal m 18 74.—On 2nd FeblU, dent, Persian Gulf, No. 960, dated 24 th ary 1874, Colonel Itoss telegraphed to Govemment- Apni 18/4. £ 0l , f a y 0ura iji e consideration, a request of Sayyid Turki that 100 barrels of gunpowder might be supplied to him, on payment. On 2nd March the Bombay Government reported to the Government of India that orders had been issued to the grand arsenal for the supply, on payment, of the gunpowder in question. No demand for payment appears to have been made until March 1880, when the Comptroller General wrote to the Political Agent, Maskat, intimating that a sum of Ks. 10,098-10-0 was still due for gun powder supplied by the Commissary of Ordnance, Bombay, to the Sultan of Maskat in 1874.

Major Grant suggested, in view of Sayyid Toorkee’s impecuniosity, that Government should accept payment by small monthly instalments, to be deducted from the Zanzibar subsidy. Govern ment having accorded consent, the instalments were, at Sayyid TurkPs request, fixed at $100 per 680.

Major Grant informed the Sultan, through the Wazir, that it would be his duty to report this occur rence to the Resident, and that he might rest assured that such a barbarous action would meet with the grave disapproval of the British Government.

In reply to a request for instructions, Colonel Ross wrote to Major Grant:— “ The matter referred for my advice seems to me a delicate one, and I think any reply to From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Sayyid Said’s question should be very guarded Any promise Govemmeat of India, No. 127, dated of protection made to the Wazir might bring about an 14th June 1880. ^ estrangement, besides being otherwise objectionaltle.

Renewal of differences between the Arabs of Ras-ul-Had and Soor regarding the use of Khor Jeramah and Khor Hijarah inlets- —In December 1880, Colonel Miles reported that fresh* difficulties had arisen regarding the free use of Khor Jeramah and Khor Hijarah by native trading vessels, the Shaikh of the Malikh tribe of Ras-ul-Had having exacted a toll of $10 from each of three Bughlahs which had taken refuge in one of them. Sayyid Turki despatched his Wazir SayyidSaid in the yacht Dar-es-Salaam to Soor and R.as-ul-Had to effect an arrangement which should put a stop to similar molestations of trading craft by the Malikhi. H.M.S. “ Woodlark” also, at the Sultan’s request, proceeded thither to afford the Wazir the support of her presence. Colonel Miles reported the result as follows:— “ H is Highness informs me that the efforts of Sayyid Said have definitely put an end to the dispute, the basis of his arrangement being that all tolls on trading vessels entering Khor Jeramah and Hijarah shall be abolished and considered illegal in future ; the Nakhodas of native craft using them, however, being bound to pay the Arabs (or any assistance rendered, and being recommended to give the Shaikh a small present of rice or dates occa sionally for his good-will and protection.” From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government, of India, No. 359, dated 27th August 1880.

Position of affairs on 1st January 1881.— At this date Oman had enjoyed two years of unusual quiet. Since Sayyid Abdul Azeez’s rising in July 1878, there had been no attempt to dispossess Sayyid Turki of the Sultanate. He had, in the meanwhile, strengthened his position by appointing his sons Faisal and Fahad, Governors of Nezwa and Barkah respectively, and the gift of a small steam yacht, the Dar-Es-Salaam, by his brother Sayyid Barghash of Zanzibar, enabled him to exercise some authority over the coast towns. The following is a sketch of the Sultan’s position written by Colonel Miles in March 1881:— u His Higkuess Sayyid Turki’s power is as much consolidated now as it is ever likely to be. He is not now in exclusive alliance either with the Resid'nt Persian Qulf to Govern. Ghafirees or with tjie Hinawis, but endeavours to maintain 1 g 81 terms with both. His sons are growing up to suppoit him, and, though still young, are entrusted with the Governorship of the three most important towns in Oman—Sohaf, Nezwa, and Barkah. His supremacy is everywhere unquestioned, for the only two ritals likely to raise their heads against him, viz., his brother Sayyid Abdul Azeez and his cousin Sayid Ibrahim-bin-kais are, though practically independent in their own districts, both entirely without resources, and are not at present regarded as the leaders of any recognized party. On the other hand, it must be said that his Highness's rule continues to be, as it ever has been, merely nominal over the interior parts of Oman ; that he exercises little or no control over the people, and receives from them no taxes beyond what they choose to pay him.' 688. Maskat and Dhofar: disturbance at Dhofar and despatch of an expedition from Maskat to restore order.—In June 1876, Colonel Miles Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- reported the assumption by Sayyid Fadhl bin- ment of India, No. 661-137, dated Allowie, the Moplah Priest implicated m the murder 5 th July 1876. of the Collector of Calicut and expatriated from Secret, September 18.6, Nos. 1 to 5. jn q{ ^ Governmont of D ho f ari 0 n the south coast of Arabia, in the name of the Porte. At that time Sayyid Turki, claiming Dhofar as a dependency of Maskat, solicited, through the Political Agent, the intervention of Government to enable him to recover possession of it. The Maskat claim to sovereignty over Dhofar was thus stated by Colonel Miles :— “ In 1820, after the murder of the old pirate Sayyid Muhammad Akil-El-Ajeibi, Dhofar was occupied by a force despatched from Maskat by His Highness Sayyid Said, and the Govern- norship was offered by His Highness to Sayyid Muhammad's brother Abdur Rahman, a mer chant in Bombay, who, however, declined the post. The Sultan’s troops were shortly after withdrawn for service in East Africa, and the district has since been uninterfered with, I believe, by Maskat, though the Chief Shaikhs are said to have visited Maskat on each accession of a new ruler to tender their submission, and they have, in fact, appeared here within the last five years to offer allegiance to His Highness Sayyid Turki.' 689. Government did not reply to Sayyid Turki’s application for aid» and Sayyid Fadhl remained in possession of Dhofar until February 1879, when the inhabitants rose against and expelled him, hoisted the Maskat Flag, and sent a deputation to tender their allegiance to Sayyid Turki. Sayyid Turki accepted the prof fered allegiance, and despatched, in March 1879, a Wali, with a guard of 100 men, to assume the government.

On news of this event reach ing Maskat, Sayyid Turki sent to Dhofar hy sea a force of 180 men under four of his most trusted officers, with instructions thus reported by Colonel Miles:— ' They are to act in accordance with the general will of the inhabitants. Should the Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- People desire to have their former Governor, Sulaiman-bin- ment of India, No. 5,dated 14th Janu- Sowailim, he is to be reinstated.

The disturbances were occasioned hy local feuds, and did not affect the Sultan’s position or his relations with the tribes. 694. Reported Negotiation between Sayyid Turki and Sayyid Barghash of Zanzibar for the former’s abdication in favour of the latter. —Dr. Kirk, Agent and Consul General at Zanzibar, reported, in a Government of India, to Resident, confidential despatch to the Government of India, Persian Gulf, No. 1348 E., dated 12th dated 8th March 1880, that he had learned that Secret,^June 1880, Nos. isotom Sayyid Turki, conscious of his inability to govern so turbulent a people as that of Oman, was anxious to abdicate, and had been in communication with his brother Sayyid Barghash of Zanzibar on the subject. Dr. Kirk had seen an autograph letter of Sayyid Turki, wherein he stated that he was willing to make Maskat over to any one who would secure him the means to retire to a foreign country ; and he understood that the brothers contemplated a meeting to discuss the matter either at Maskat or Zanzibar. 695. The Resident in the Persian Gulf was directed to report whether he had reason to believe that Sayyid Turki medi tated immediate retirement, and to state his views as to what steps should be adopted to prevent disorder at Maskat in the event of the Sultan’s abdicating. The Resident replied that no intel ligence regarding Sayyid Turki’s abdicating had transpired at Bushire or Maskat, and that the ques- Government of India to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 1348 E., dated 12th April 1880.

Some months later Colonel Koss reported :— “ Since the correspondence in question passed, I have from time to time been in communica- Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- tion 011 t,ie subject with the Political A^eut, Muskat, who ment of India, No. 55, dated Stb April ascertained that the neo-ociation between Sayyid Turki and 1881 - , Sayyid Barghtish had undoubtedly taken place and was no longer a secret, being a common topic of conversation in the bazars of Maskat, and had ceased, for the present at least, to be a matter of any practical importance.^ 696. Orders of Government as to the Political Agent’s course, should Resident, Persian G„if, to Govern. Ae Sultan die suddenly and the succession be ment of India, No. 55, dated 8tb disputed. — In a report on the situation at Maskat, p£l! A 1 ! June 1881, Nos. 150 to 452 . ? ate&lt; ? the 26th March 1881, Colonel Miles requested, in view of Sayyid Turki’s precarious health, in structions as to his proper course, should the Sultan die suddenly, and the suc cession be disputed. The instructions then issued to the Resident were as fol lows :— “It appears from the report enclosed in your letter that Sayyid Turki’s power may Government of India, to Resident, for the present be regarded as Hrmly established, and that Persian Gulf, No. 1354 E.P., dated 25th during his lifetime there is little likelihood of any serious June 1881. disturbance in Oman. But, on the other hand, his health is Poll. A .June 1881, Nos. 450 to 452. j n a precarious state; and the Political Agent anticipates that his death will certainly throw the whole country into anarchy and disorder. Under these circumstances, Colonel Miles asks for instructions as to the line of policy to be adopted with regard to the question of succession, and he inquires whether an asylum is to be afforded to Sayyid Turki’s sons, if they should determine to avoid a contest and seek the protection of British Government. In forwarding the Political Agent’s letter you assume that the Govern ment of India would, in the event of a disputed succession, adopt a policy of non-interference, so far as might he compatible with the protection of British interests; but you express an opinion that Sayyid Abdul Azeez would be the most desirable successor. With regard to Sayyid Turki’s sons you remark that it would be most in accordance with custom and humanity to give all reasonable attention to such an appeal as Colonel Miles contemplates. “ In regard to this last point your views are accepted by the Government of India. If under the eventualities stated, Sayyid Turki’s sons should ask for British protection, it may be afforded them, so far as may be necessary for their shelter from immediate personal danger: though upon questions such as in what manner or for what period protection can be given, the British representative must of course be guided by the circumstances of the time. “ With reference to the main question at issue, I am to say that it is not the intention of Government to interfere actively with the course of a possible dynastic struggle in Oman, unless interference should become necessary to prevent the reunion of Maskat and Zanzibar. Putting aside Sayyid Barghash or whoever might then be the ruler of Zanzibar, the Government of India would view with satisfaction the succession in Oman of one of the descendants of Sayyid Said, provided that he were capable of preserving internal order, conducting the government of the State, and upholding existing relations between Maskat and the British Government. “ It is impossible to anticipate all contingencies, but your general instructions are that the succession must be settled by the chiefs and people of the country; and that the first, if not the only duty of the Political Officer in the event of a contest, would be to secure for British subjects at Maskat and elsewhere on the Oman coast adequate protection against injuries to person or property.” 697.

It it rested onty on the construction of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873, we think it would he held that the Consul at Maskat was entitled to exercise only the more limited juris diction. We think the definition of East African Courts contained in that Act, when read with section 3, limited the jurisdiction of the Consul to cases when he was acting within the powers conferred upon him by Order in Council. “ But an Act has since been passed, the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1S79, to which the attention of the Government of India does not appear to have been called, which materially alters the Act of 1873. By the late Act a new definition is substituted for the term ‘ East African Court/ And when this new definition is read with section 3 of the Act of 1873, we think, though the point is not free from doubt, that the jurisdiction of the Consul is no longer limited as it was before.” 699. Murder of a British Indian Trader at Mattrah— On 29th . ^ ^November 1881, Major Grant reported that a ernmentof’ln^No. 24 o,’dated thh banian trader, named Tejoo YValloo, had been shot December 1881. jn the bazaar at Mattrah on the 25th, at about 7 Poll, a., Jan. 1882 ,Nos. 410 to421. ^ evening, by some person unknown. The Political Agent’s opinion and the general impression at Maskat were that the crime had been committed by one of Sayyid Turki’s Wahhabi mercenaries, but no evidence to inculoate any of them was obtained. Suspicion pointed n + A to a \Y*ahhabi soldier named Sa’ad Daiyinee who e&gt;K.en , msian u , o ov- Mattrah for Bahrain in a native boat some days after the murder, but the evidence of the Nakhoda of the boat, taken hy the Residency Agent at Bahrain, showed that Sa’ad could not well have been the culprit. The Wahhabi garrison of Mattrah assumed a defiant attitude towards the Sultan, and caused Sa’ad’s brother, who had been arrested on suspicion, to be released.

Colonel Ross replied that it had not been shown that the dis missal of the guard was necessary for the security of British subjects, and that— “even if firmly convinced that the measure would be for His Highnesses best interests, I would not consider it expedient to advise the Sultan on a matter of administration of this sort, as it would incur for Government a responsibility which is not in accordance with the policy towards the Maskat State. Some years hack His Highness of his own accord got rid cf his Wahhabis, and made other arrangements, and, although, the Political Agent thought it dan gerous, it was considered right to avoid offering advice. Subsequently His Highness became convinced that Maskat was insecure without a mercenary guard and re-enlisted the Nejdiaus.”165 701.

Colonel Ross, in submitting the question to Gov ernment, observed that he was not prepared to recommend that Sayyid Turki should be required to make the amount good, and saw no other way of recover ing it. 702. Government signified approval of the Resident’s views and instructed him to impress upon the Sultan the necessity for discovering the murderer and stolen property. The crime remained undetected.

Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior of Oman in 1881. —Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior during 1881 are thus noted in the administration reports of the Maskat Agency:— “In January the Beni Kelban and other Gliafiree tribes who, at the instigation of Shaikh Barghash, were still besieging the fort of Bu Eineni, made an attack on the Baluch garrison and retired with seven killed. The date groves and aqueducts of Eineni have all been de stroyed by the besiegers. “In the following month a collision occurred between the Beni Bu Ali and the Beni Bu Hasan, in which the former were defeated with a loss of 22 killed, the latter losing about 2(J. On the news reaching Maskat H. H. Sayyid Turki despatched an officer to mediate between them. “In April there was a struggle in Jaalan between the two powerful tribes Beni Bu Ali and Beni Bu Hasan, in which the former were defeated, owing to their being greatly out numbered and taken by surprise. They lost 2U men and the Beni Bu Hasau 17. “In May the Baluch garrison of El Eineen, finding that they could not hold the fort against the Beni Ghafir who had besieged it, offered to give it up to the Beni Ali of Yinkal belonging to the Hinawi faction, and the offer was gladly accepted. The Beni Ghafir upon this formed an alliance with various Ghafiree tribes in order to oppose the Beni Ali and pre vent the retention of the fort by the H inawis. The struggle for possession of the fort at last terminated about the end of June by the garrison making a vigorous and successful sortie against the besiegers, who, being beaten and dispersed, finally abandoned the siege and re turned to their homes. Fifty-two men were killed in this action. “About this time (June) the Ibryieen and Beni Ryam disputed for the possession of the fort El Awabi. The matter was finally settled by the fort being handed over to H. H. Sayyid Turki, who assumed nominal possession of it, though it is still garrisoned by the Ibriyeen. “ A two months' truce between the Beni Bu Ali and Beni Bu Hasan having expired, the former, having given the stipulated five days' notice, attacked the latter at Jawabi El Knoweyseh. The loss of life in this action was heavy, the Beni Bu Ali losing 60 men and the Beni Bu Hasan 75. It appears that the Beni Bu Ali were aided by the Jenebeh, Beni Rasid, and Hishm tribes, whilst the Beni Bu Hasan| fought alone. “At the commencement of July an increased tax or octroi of five per cent, was established by H. H. Sayyid Turki on all produce arriving from the interior. The former tax on the various articles of produce varied from about U to 2£ per cent, and was included in the general lease granted to the farmer of customs. The increased tax was purchased for the year for $15,000. “In July Shaikh Sulaiman Bin Said was murdered at Seheleh by the Beni Said, and a few days after a servant of His Highness was killed by a party of the Beni Naeem ; the object of both these murders was political, as both the tribes were on bad terms with His Highness and were threatening to attack Sohar: but on the arrival of His Highness'yacht Dar-Es-Salaam at that fort with stores and ammunitions for the garrison they abandoned their design. “From July to September disquieting rumours prevailed regarding a coalition of the tribes under Shaikh Salth Bin Ali against Maskat, but owiug to disagreements amongst the leaders it all fell through.166 “ On 24tli October news arrived that the fort of Nalclil bad been taken by the El Zaribab. H. H. Sayyid Turki left for Barkah immediately with the intention of collecting 1 a force to recapture it; but on his arrival lie found that through the mediation of Muhammad Bin Zanani, Shaikh of the Beni Hadram tribe, the enemy had withdrawn on receiving $500. His Highness paid this sum, and after making presents to the head-men of Nakhl returned to Maskat on 1st November.” 704 —Position of affairs on 1st January 1882 —No event affecting the general situation in- Oman occurred in 1881. At the Beginning of 1882 Sayyid Turki exercised authority, directly or through Walis nominated by him. over the following towns and fortresses : Maskat, Matfrah, Shinas, Sohar, Sowaik, Masnaah, Barkah, Seeb, Kuryat, Soor, Dhofar, Semail, Nakhl, and the dependency of Gwadur on the Mekran coast. Elsewhere throughout Oman, except in the districts of El Rostak and El Semed, which were held by Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais and Sayyid Abdul Azeez, respectively, his suzerainty was generally acknowledged and his mediation to arrange intertribal disputes accept ed; but he obtained revenue from Maskat and Mattrah only, and was obliged to pay subsidies to various Shaikhs of tribes for their support or quiescence. The Walis of his Inland forts not infrequently refused to give up possession when called upon by him to do so, and had to be ejected by intrigue or bribed to resign. 705—Coalition of Sayyid Abdul Azeez, Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais, Shaikh Salih Bin Ali, and Hamood El Jahafi, against Sayyid Turki.— Resident, Persian Gnif. to Govern- On 9th January 1882, Major Grant reported the ment of India, No. 2o, dated isth arrival of news from the interior that Sayyid Abdul danuary i8 s 2 Azeez, Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais, Shaikh Salih P ' A l * eb - lm Nos - 8l ' 88 - Bin Ali, and Hamood El Jahafi had come to an arrangement to attack Maskat, and raid El Batinah and Soor simultaneously. It was stated that the Hijriyeen tribe were willing to join the movement, and that the Beni Bu Ali and El Mesakireh, usually staunch supporters of Sayyid Turki had determined to remain neutral, being offended at the manner in which the Sultan had recently treated a Shaikh of the former tribe. Among the tribes, generally, much discontent had been caused by the recent imposition by Sayyid Turki of an octroi duty of five per cent, on all produce entering Maskat and Mattrah from the interior, whether for local consumption or for shipment, and no inclination to support the Sultan, or oppose the coalition was manifested. 706. On 13th January Sayyid Abdul Azeez addressed to the Resident, Resident, Persian Gulf, t«Govern- Persian Gulf, a letter, wherein, after dwelling upon Precis, paragraph 703. went of India, No. 30, dated 4th February 1882 PcIL A., March 1882,Nos. 82-89. the feebleness and inefficiency of his brother’s rule, and the discontent prevailing throughout Oman, he announced his intention of yielding to a general desire that he should lead the tribes against Maskat. He begged the Resident to direct the Political Agent to take measures for the safety of British subjects by causing them to embark when he approached the town. 707. Colonel Ross requested instructions of Government as to whether, in Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- the event of Sayyid Abdul Azeez attacking Maskat, the same assistance given to Sayyid Turki in 1877 might again he accorded. In reply, he was referred to previous instructions, contained in No. 1354-E.P., dated 25th June 1881. 708. To Sayyid Abdul Azeez the Resident replied as follows:— “ You are aware of the relations subsisting between the British Government and His Highness Sayyid Turki, which relations have never been altered since His Highness's accession to the Sultanate. It is, therefore, almost unnecessary to tell your Highness that any attack on Maskat at present would be quite against the wishes of the British Govern ment.” went of India, telegram, dated 30th January 1882.

On 7th March the Political Agent telegraphed that the coalition had dispersed owing to disunion among the Chiefs, — a result to which the itesident s letter to Sayyid Abdul Azeez had probably contributed. 710- Capture of El Masnaah Fort by Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais: its recapture by Sayyid Turin. —On 12th March 1882 the Political ^gent r. j x n nr * n reported that Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais had captur- me^t’orind^r*' ed El Masnaah’fort on the Batinah coast by sur- March 1882. prise, and that Sayyid Turki had telegraphed to Poll, a., June 1882, Nos. 262-289. ^ brother Sayyid Barghasli of Zanzibar for aid. Colonel Boss directed Major Grant to send H. M. S. Beady to Masnaah to protect British subjects and property, but to abstain from all intervention. 711. On occupying the fort Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais assembled the Indian traders in the town, and told them they were under his protection and had nothing to fear. No plundering occurred, and next day business proceeded in the bazaar as usual. Sayyid Ibrahim wrote to the Political Agent, informing him of the capture of ErMasnaah, and of his intention to protect British sub jects and property. 712. On the 24th March Sayyid Turki informed the Political Agent of his intention to proceed in person with a force to reta . ke E! Masnaah, and he requested that British April 1882. subjects might be warned to leave the place and Poll, a., June 1882, Nos. 262-289. remove their property. On 4th April the Sultan embarked in his yacht the Dar-ul-Salaam taking with him an 18-pounder siege gun and 150 men. He sent an equal number overland, and, landing at °Barkah, collected a further force from the tribes in that neighbourhood. H. M. S. Beady proceeded to El Masnaah to watch events. On the 9th April, and during the forenoon of the 10th, the fort was bombarded, and then assaulted and taken April 1882. after an obstinate defence, in which several men Poll, a., June 1882 , Nos. 262-289. were jailed 0 n both sides. Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais was not present, having gone to El Rostak to organise, it was said, a descent upon Maskat. 713. Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Hamood El Jahafi besiege Mattrah and exact terms from the Sultan.— On 26th June Major Grant tele graphed :— “Present situation, Abdul Azeez and Hamood besieging Mattrah. Negociations for peace going on. No attack apprehended. Arab here.” 714. Colonel Boss was at this time on the point of proceeding to Europe, but telegraphed to Government that he would, if necessary, postpone his leave and visit Maskat, which being approved, he did, arriving there on 4th July. 715. Major Grant’s written reports, dated 26th June and 3rd July, con tained the following details : On 21st June rumours m.m'ori;,d?»'No. 0 l 4 i,‘dfted it'h were current at Maskat that Sayyid Abdul Azeez July 1882. and the freebooter Hamood El Jahafi had, 'with Poll, a., Aug. 1882, Nos. 254-275. a f orco 0 f Bedouin robbers, got through the pass of El Akk, leading from El Sharkiyeh to Maskat, to hold which the Nadabiyeen and Rahbiyeen tribes were subsidised by Sayyid Turki. On the 22nd the Minister, Sayyid Saeed, informed Major Grant that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Hamood had arrived at El Wuteyyah, three miles from Mattrah, and requested him to write to Sayyid Abdul Azeez, and remind him that an attack upon Mattrah would be contrary to the already expressed wishes of the British Government. Major Grant did so, and Sayyid Abdul Azeez at once replied that his intention was to attack Mattrah and Maskat, and he requested that British subjects might Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern ment of India, No. 136, dated 27th June 1882. Poll. A , Augt. 1882, Nos. 254-275.168 be warned to place themselves and their property in safety. Major Grant issued a notice to British subjects accordingly. Sayyid Turki despatched the Dar-uUSalaam to Barkah and Sohar for aid, and having armed a number of Seedees and Baluchis at Maskat, sent them to Mattrah. Tiie rebel force, consisting almost entirely of Hamood’s freebooters, did not exceed 200 men, and was much inferior in number to the Garrison of Mattrah, but Sayyid f lurki had not courage to assume the offensive. 716. On the 24th H. M. S. Arab arrived opportunely, and anchored off Mat trah. Later in the day the Sultan received a message from Hamood that he was willing to come in to Maskat, under the safe conduct of certain Shaikhs, then with Sayyid Turki, whom he named, to treat for peace. The Shaikhs in question were sent to El Wuteyyah the next morning, and returned with Hamood, who, having received presents of food and money from the Sultan, went back to El Wuteyyah that evening. Negotiations between the Sultan and the rebels con tinued during the 27th and 2Sth, when it was arranged that the Sultan should in future pay to Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih Bin Ali monthly pen sions of dollars 200 and dollars 50, respectively. Hamood was satisfied with a present of money and food, and permission to visit Maskat with 4o follow'ers once a year to receive gifts. 717. Major Grant concluded his final report with the following remarks :— “ The events of the last ten days must have shown the whole of Oman how easily a bold leader like Hamood with a handful of men can dictate terms and extort money at the &lt;;ates of the capital. It is said that Abdool Azeez has damaged his reputation very much by joining an expedition led by si ch a notorious freebooter as Hamood-El-Jahafi.” 718 Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior of Oman in 1882. —Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior during 18S2 are thus noted in the Administration Beports of the Maskat Agency :— “In the month of May a collision was expected to occur between the Beni Jabir, Ghafiri, and the Beni Loalra, Hinawi, in Wadi Semail, in consequence of the former having destroyed some date trees belonging to the latter. These two tribes are always at feud. On 30th May Sayyid Faisal proceeded to Semail to mediate between them, and having succeeded in patching up a peace, returned on JiJth June. “In July Sayyid Faisal was sent to punish the Shaikh of the Madabiyeen, Sultan Bin Saif, who had given Sayyid Abdul Azeez passage through the pass of Akk; on his approach, however, Sulaim went to Abdul Azeez and Salih Bin Ali, who sent letters to both His High ness Sayyid Turki and Sayyid Faisal, declaring that they would resent his being molested, and, on receipt by Faisal of the letter to his address, he immediately returned to Maskat The reason assigned for the defection of the Nadabiyeen on this occasion was that the inhabitants of a small date plantation, named Suroor, at the foot of the pass, who had hitherto been con sidered as allied to the Nadahiyeen, were given recognition by His Highness Sayyid Turki as belonging to the Beni Jabir, whom they preferred, thus giving the Beni Jabir a preponderance of strength at the cost of the Nadabiyeen. “In October Shaikh Salih Bin Ali asked permission to visit the Sultan in Maskat accom panied by 150 followers. His Highness declined the proposed visit. “ About this time also the Makaheel and Naeem were reported to he devastating the country about Sohar, not, however, from any political motive, but solely for the sake of plunder. “On the 4th November Saif Bin Muhsin of the Beni Hina,.commander of the garrison of the strong fort of Hazam on the Batinah, which for the hist twelve years has belonged to Ibrahim Bin Kais, returned from a visit to Hilal Bin Zahir of Nezwa, and immediately turned the wife and all the servants of Ibrahim Bin Kais out of the fort. Hilal Bin Zahir, who was undoubtedly at the bottom of the affair, wrote to His Highness Sayyid Turki that, if he would give him active support, he would also seize the fort of Rostak, which was then garrisoned by the Beni Hina; but Ibrahim Bin Kais, on hearing of what had occurred at Hazam, called upon the Beni Roaha to take the phices of the Beni Hina and Rostak, which they did without any collision occurring, and HilaFs opportunity was lost. His Highness Sayyid Turki endeavoured to get Hnzam made over to him, but, in January 18S3, through the mediation of the very learned Muhammed Bin Sulaiyim El Gharibi, and influence of the Yal Sad, the fort was restored to Ibrahim Bin Kais by the Beni liina, and is now garrisoned by his dependents.”169 719. Position of affairs on 1st January 1883 .— -The chief events during 18S2 had been the capture of El IVtasnaah Port by Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais ; its prompt recapture by Sayyid Turki; the siege of Mattrah by Sayyid Abdul Azeez and the freebooter Hamood El Jabafi ; and their exaction of terms from the Sultan. The balance of these occurrences was rather against Sayyid Turki, but the general situation in Oman remained much the same at the end of 1882 as it had been at the beginning. 720. Resumption of friendly correspondence between Sayyid Turki and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais: acceptance by the latter of a monthly allowance of $100. —On 20th March 1883 Major Grant reported:— '‘About days ago, His Highness Sayyid Turki sent some messengers to Rostak with Resident, Pcrsinn Gulf, t..

Sayyid Turki’s arrangements with the tribes occupying passes between El Sharkiyeh and Maskat to hold them for him: discord among those tribes: proceedings of Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih bin Ali- —It has been mentioned bow the Isadabiyeen and Eahbiyeen tribes, although subsidized by Sayyid Turki to Paragraph / 5. hold the pass of El Akk between El Sharkiyeh and Maskat, allowed Sayyid Abdul Azeez and the freebooter Hamood El Jahafi with their following passage through it in June 1882 : and how the defection of the Nadaniyeen on that occasion was attributed to Paragraph 718. the Sultan’s having decided against them in a dispute with the Beni Jabir regarding possession of the village and date plantation of Suroor. On 29th May Major Mockler, the Acting Political Agent, report ed :— “ I am told that within the last few days His Highness has given charge of the passes „ p MV „ rn leading to Miskat to the Beni Jabir. Since the general ment of India, No. 119 , dated 6th June settlement of last year the Itahbiyeen and Nadabiyeen, the 1883. _ tribes inhabiting the two pasees of Manah and Akk, leading A. Poll.

It is now proposed to transfer this stipend to the I eni Jabir, who engage to guard the passes nearer to Maskat. But if, as appears the case, their villages lie in front of these passes, at the mercy of an invading force, it could hardly be difficult to compel them to give passage.” And on 9 th June:— « It is said that the Bahbiyeen and Nadabiyeen have written to say that they intend to open the passes, having heard that their subsidy is to be J^ ! „ d rn,d^?N' 128,'discontinued, and that a reply has been sent to them that June 1883. their pay has not been stopped, and that they are to hold the A.

On 18th June the Nadabiyeen again allowed the freebooter Hamood Resident, Persian Gnl f , to Govern* El Jahafi to pass through El Akk towards Maskat me.it of India, No. 139, dated 3rd with 200 followers, but the Beni Jabir and Siabiyeen July 1883. stopped him near Suroor. Sayyid Turki sent a. pXr P A«nr 1883 , Nos. 105-114. w^ord to the Nadabiyeen and Bahbiyeen that the Resident, Persian Gulf, to the allowances previously paid them would be renewed int'll'Jufv' 3 ^ 88 3 1 ' dla ’ No ‘ loi)dated if they held the passes for him as formerly, and jv. Poll E.. Aug. 1883, Nos. 105-114. they promised to do so. The dispute between the Beni Jabir and the Nadabiyeen regarding Suroor, however, continued, and the former, reinforced by the people of Nakhl, attacked the Nadabiyeen, expelled them from Suroor, and cut down some of their date-trees. Sayyid Abdul Azeez170 and Shaikh Salih bin AH wrote to Sayyid Turki, stating that they intended to assist the Nadabiyeen against the Beni Jabir. The Sultan thereupon sent some of the chief men in attendance upon him to the Shaikhs of the Nadabiyeen and Beni Jabir to ask them to come to Maskat, in order that their differences might be arranged. The messengers returned unsuccessful, and reported that the Shaikhs of the Nadabiyeen and llahbiyeen had gone to El Sharkiyeh. ^ „ Sayyid Abdul Azeez, in reply to a request of Sayyid Turki that he would prevent the intervention July lass. of the El Sharkiyeh tribes, wrote that the Shaikh A. Foil, e., Nov. 1883, Noa. 88118. R a hbiyeen, with some of the Haboos, had gone to Shaikh Salih bin Ali, and that they were consulting about attacking the Beni Jabir at Seraail. As regarded himself, Sayyid Abdul Azeez promised to abstain from interference. The Beni Jabir having, about the end of June, destroyed some houses of the Nadabiyeen at Suroor, Shaikh Salih bin Ali wrote a protest to the Sultan, and the Nadabiyeen sent word that, as they understood the Beni Jabir had acted by his orders, their undertaking to hold their passes was at an end. The Beni Jabir, at the same time, intimated to Sayyid Turki that unless he or one of his sons led them they could not withstand the Nadabiyeen, if aided from El Sharkiyeh. The Sultan thought of proceeding to Semail in person but was dissuaded. He wrote to the Shaikh of the Nadabiyeen, inviting him to come and bring the Shaikh of the Rahbiyeen, when the latter returned from El Sharkiyeh, to Beerani, where the Minister, Sayyid Said, would meet them and discuss matters. 723. Reports that a coalition of El Sharkiyeh tribes was being formed, ostensibly to expel the Beni Jabir from Suroor, but really against Sayyid Turki, continued to reach Maskat until 16th August, when Major Mockler telegraphed :— “This morning Sayyid Turki received letters of yesterday's date from Abdul Aze**z Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- and Salah Horn Suroor, saying they intend coming to Maskat. ment of India, No. 172, dated 18th That Beni Jabir and Siyabiyeen have submitted to them.

Why, being already within the passes and having so large a force with them, they withdrew at this time does not appear. It was probably owing, as usual, to dissension among the leaders. 725. On 2nd September the Shaikhs of the Beni Jabir and Siyabiyeen, summoned by Sayyid Turki to explain the arrangements effected by Sayyid Abdul Azeez and* Shaikh Salah bin Ali, and their submission to the former, arrived at Maskat; and on the 29th two sons of the Shaikh of the Nadabiyeen and the Shaikhs of the Rahbiyeen came in with Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim of the Beni Bu Ali, whom the Sultan had Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern ment of India, No. 207, dated lith October 1883. .i.

D . r \r ^ r Maior Mockler reported tliat the Wazeer Sayyid Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- .J f , x e i Aij ment of India, No. 139, dated 3rd Said had visited him some days before, anti tola July 1883. him that Hamood El Jahafi was expected on a A. Poll. E., Aug. 1883, Nos. 105 114. visit to Maskatj and that Sayyid Turki would probably take the opportunity to put him to death. In view of possible disturbance the Minister strongly advised the presence of a man-of-war, especially as Sayyid Abdul Azeez, Shaikh Salah bin Ali, Shaikh Hilal bin Zahir and Hamood were said to have been recently in communica tion. Major Mockler accordingly requested the Commander of H. M. S. Philomel, which was in port, to remain at Maskat. 727. On 18th June Sayyid Turki, in anticipation of Hamood’s arrival, left Maskat for Falaj, taking with him a gun and some ammunition. Hamood, however, although permitted by the Nidabiyeen to pass through El Akk, was stopped near Suroor by the Beni Jabir and Siyabiyeen, they having had orders to deny him passage if accompanied by more than 40 men, and his following being some 200. Sayyid Turki, on reaching Falaj, despatched a messenger to Barkah for men, and, in the hope of inducing Hamood with his formidable fol lowing to retire, sent him $300 with an intimation that his presence at Maskat was not required. Hamood rejected the $300 as insufficient, and the bearer v ■ r u i r of it brought it back. On the 22nd Sayyid Tur- Resideut, Persinn Gulf, to Govern- ~ oaa ment of India, No. 154, dated 28th ki s messenger returned from Barkan witu 2UU July 1883. ' _ men. Next day he sent to offer Hamood $50 for A.Poll.E., Aug 1883, Nos. 100-114. | dmse ]f and $2 f U r each of his followers, if they would retire. At the same time he informed the Nadabiyeen and Rahbiyeen that the allowances formerly paid them would be renewed if they'held their passes for him in future. The Nadabiyeen and Rahbiyeen sent favourable replies, but Hamood rejected the terms offered. He, how r ever, retired to El Sharkiyeh, where he visited Sayyid Abdul Azeez, but stayed with him only a few hours. On 27th June the Sultan received a letter from Shaikh Salah bin Ali, protesting against Hamood’s not having been allowed to visit Maskat. 728.

Philomel shells the rebels: Political Agent’s proceedings ap proved by the Government of India and H.

On 15th October Colonel Miles reported :— “ On hearing of Sayyid Faisal’s arrival at Semail, Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Salah came down to the Wadi Mahram to interview the Hinawis of the Upper Valley and to effect a coa lition of them as a counter-plot to any possible amalgamation of the Ghafirees.

It is rumoured tliat Shaikh Salah has mortgaged bis property for $9,000 to raise funds, and that Shaikh Jumah the Mutowwa of the Mesakerah has mortgaged his for $6,000, but there is some doubt as to who is to lead the movement.

Solicit speedy instruc tions, respectfully urging Turki’s claims to support.” In reply Colonel Ross referred Colonel Miles to his An gust, which was as follows :— “ Advance Turki subsidy to extent of urgent necessities for defence if asked.

On full consideration of Government orders and of circumstances, I deemed it best to comply, and two shells were Hred from Philomel over rebel’s position, deterring them from advance.

Mo - m dat “ 1 the following detailed report of the attack and A. Poll. E., Jan. 1884, Nov. 327-394. repulse, and his own proceedings :— “ On the 19th I received a letter from Sayyid Abdul Azeez acquainting me with his intentions, and requesting that British subjects might be removed from dangei” In my reply to this letter, which was shown to, and approved of by, His Highness t'ayyid Turki before despatch, I reminied Sayyid Abdul Azeez of the terms of your letter of March 18&lt;32, to his address, and tendered my good offices in mediating between himself and his brother Sayyid Turki under sanction of Government. A reply to my letter reached me a few hours before the attack, in which Sayyid Abdul Azeez declined mediation, and repeated his request regarding the safety of the British subjects. The letter of Sayyid Abdul Azeez was the first certain intimation received in Maskat of his having joined the rebel confederacy, and it no longer left room for doubt as to their intentions. “ His Highness Sayyid Turki had already done all that bad suggested itself to him to put the town in u defensive state, and he now busied himself in distributing the garrison and 172 m T173 inspecting the posts with an energy which, considering his health, surprised all. His High ness had not sullieient troops to garrison both Maskat and Mattrah effectively, and the latter town being the less important, was accordingly left with a very weak force to defend it. The number of men collected in Maskat was nearly 50 ', which was deemed sufficient, and, as it turned out, this arrangement was the best that could have been made. His Highness also despatched letters in all directions, inviting the Ghafiri tribes to his assistance. “ Full precautionary measures were taken for the protection of British subjects. The banyan traders of Maskat were directed to ship their valuables on board vessels in the harbour, and were warned to be prepared to go on board themselves at a moment's notice. The banyans of Mattrah were brought round to Maskat, and the Khojahs were desired by me to consult and ■ decide on their course of .action. A few went aHoat. but the majority elected to remain in their fort, where they deemed themselves safe from molestation. His Highness Sayyid Turki was good enough to offer Fort Jelali as an asylum for any British subjects, who might desire to avail of it, but, happily, the need for its shelter has not arisen. “ On the morning of the 21st, Sunday, it was reported that the vanguard of the rebel force had arrived at Rui, about 2 miles beyond Mattrah. While Sayyid Abdul Azeez was supposed to be restirg comfortably there, he, having adopted a novel and skilfully conceived plan of operations, was marching down through the Wadi el Kabeer, or great valley, to capture Maskat by surprise. “ At about half-past one a.m., the attacking party appeared in front of the walls and made a simultaneous attack in three places, where the walls seemed to offer a better chance of being scaled, they were dressed in black clothes in order to allow of their appoaching as near as possible unobserved, an excellent plan, as the night was very dark, and they were provided with hastily prepared scaling ladders. “ The attack was entirely unexpected, but the garrison was fortunately on the alert and received the intruders with so effective and continuous a fire that the latter were sharply checked and thrown into disorder. Sayyid Abdul Azeez behaved, it is said, with great gallantry and made determined efforts to bring up his men and place the ladders, but the fire was too heavy and he was compelled to retreat, leaving a npmber of dead in front of the walls. &lt;e Sayyid Turki, on hearing of the attack, sent the message on to me, and went immediately to the ramparts to encourage his men ; by the time I arrived the attack was over and the firing had ceased. No further attempt was made that night, and when day dawned not one of the enemy was in sight. It was soon ascertained however from spies that the invaders had returned to the upper part of the valley and to liui, that Sayyid Abdul Azeez, with a small following, had retired first, to Sedab, from whence he shortly after proceeded to Rui to join Shaikh Salih, who had not personally appeared on the scene of action. “ The attack it was generally expected would be renewed on the following night, and as it was currently reported that Sayyid Abdul Azeez had a very large force with him, it was antici pated that a still more determined assault than the first would be made. Apprehensive of the inadequacy of his garrison to offer an effectual resistance to heavy odds, His Highness Sayyid Turki addressed to me a formal request in writing for the active support of H. M. S. Vhilr.mel. For the reasons I shall presently adduce, and after full consideration of the policy of Government, as laid down in the instructions received from time to time, it seemed to me that I should be acting for the best, in the interests of this country, and for the protection of Btitish life and property, by acceding to His Highness' request, and I accordingly promised to do so. Before proceeding to act, however, I took the precaution of ordering all British subjects remaining in Maskat out of the town and sent them on board vessels in the harbour, except those attached to this Agency. “ During the day the Dar-nl-Salaam, which had been despatched to Soor with letters for the tribes in Jaalan, returned with about 70 men of the Jenebth: this small reinforcement, together with the promise of support from the man-of-war, gave heart and courage to the defence. In the afternoon His Highness had reason to believe that Sayyid Abdul Azeez had changed the direction of his operations and would lead his force during the night against Mattrah, and, at His Highness' request, I proceeded there in the Philomel to watch events and to aid, if necessary, in preserving that town. “ On landing at Mattrah, with Captain Lang, I found the town almost deserted, the Arab population having retired to boats in the harbour. I communicated personally with the Governor of the town, who stated that the rebels were in the plain outside, and that a small attack had been made that night and repulsed. He added that he had been led to believe that a vigorous assault would be made on the walls, and that with his little garrison he was hardly in a position to meet it successfully. I therefore desired Captain Lang to throw a couple of shells over the rebels' position to deter them from advancing. This appeared to have the desired effect, and we returned to Maskat.'+1 Tuestla ‘ y ’ ~^rd, His Highness Sayyid Turki requested that a few shots might be irown by H. M. S. Philomel to deter the enemy, which was done at intervals during the night and the effect intended appeared to be produced. On the following morning, the 24th, the rebels appeared in force at the upper end of the valley, and on the heights above Kalbuh, from whence they kept up a fire on the towers guarding the sweet water-supply of the town, which it appeared to be their object to capture. It was fully expected that an attack would be made after dark and the usual preparations were made by the garrison to meet it. At the Sultan’s request Captain Lang maintained an irregular fire at intervals throughout the night to dis concert the enemy and prevent their forming attacking parties. The intended effect was pro duced, for though the Arabs were seen moving about no attack was made. “ The Shaikhs of the Mesakereh and Harth Tribes, inimical to Shaikhs Salih bin AH and Jumah bin Said, arrived on the 25th with reinforcements to the number of over 300 in obedience to His Highness Sayyid Turki’s summons, and confidence was now to a great extent restored, as it was believed that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih, seeing the futility of further hostilities, would now retire. The Arabs maintained a threatening attitude all day, but, as it now seemed improbable to me that they meditated any further attack on the town, I took the wishes of the Sultan as regards continuing the fire of H. M. S. Philomel. His Highness said he believed his brother’s efforts would now cease, and he, moreover, considered his own strength to be sufficient to cope with him, even in the event of hostilities being re newed. With His Highness’ full . oneurrence therefore I requested Captain Lang in the even ing to suspend further action, and the Philomel’s fire has not since been resumed. Ihe next day, 2fith, a small fleet of boats sailed into the harbour, bringing reinforce ments from various parts to the number of 700 or 800, and the relative position of the parties began to change. The gates were thrown open, and the garrison left their defences. In the afternoon His Highness received news that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih had broken camp at Rui and retreated homewards, leaving a small party only to bring on the wounded. The loss sustained by the attacking force on the first night and in the subsequent skirmishing was very severe, anil Sayyid Turki remarked to me that so decisive a conflict had not occurred in ’Oman since the battle of Dhank in 1869. The number of killed is now reckoned at about 70, including three or four Shaikhs. “ In deciding to accord to His Highness Sayyid Turki the active support formally requested by bim, I have acted under a due sense of responsibility. Looking back to the in structions that have been received from the Government of India during the past ten years as to the policy to be pursued by this Agency in regard to Sayyid Turki, it appears that the first orders were received in January 1874, on the occasion of an attack of Shaikh Salih bin Ah, when the Resident was empowered to support His Highness Sayyid Turki as far as the guns of a vessel of war could reach. And during that year His Highness received substan tial aid from us. The orders contained in your telegram on the 16th August 1875, while confirming this policy, explained the views of Government more clearly and fully. “ In June l87 ? an unexpected incursion was made on Maskatby Shaikh Salih and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais, and the Acting Political Agent, on the authority of the instructions last quoted, gave the Sultan the aid of the guns of H. M. S. Teazer in repelling the attack. These proceedings were approved of by Government, and the effect of our action Then has been so satisfactory in crippling the power of Shaikh Salih for mischief, that Maskat has from that time enjoyed peace and immunity from threatened violence until now. In my letter, dated 26th March 1881, I took the view that His Highness Sayyid Turki was strong enough to stand alone, but that, as his health was very precarious, instructions were advisable in anticipation of his death. I expressed the opinion that the death of Sayvid Turki would result in a general confusion and anarchy, and, I might venture to add, that the same results would ensue should Sayyid Turki be ousted from power, with the’additional complication that His Highness would have to be provided for in some w:iy. “ The claims of His Highness Sayyid Turki for favourable consideration are well known to Government, and it is hardly necessary for me to refer to them. He has faithfully adhered to all his engagements, and he has, on all occasions, shown proofs of his loyalty and friendship to the British Government. 1 “It was generally understood that His Highness expected support from us, and it was clear to me that to have withheld from him now the aid he had received on a similar occasion in 1877 would have been considered by both parties as equivalent to a negative support to Sayyid Abdul Azeez, for they would have inferred that Sayyid Turki had for some reason forfeited the favour of the British Government. “ 1 also to consider the position of the British Indian subjects, who hold the trade of Maskat and Mattrah in their hands. They had property at stake to the value of many lakhs of rupees, and, had the place been captured, the loss resulting from excesses and plunder bv the Arabs would have fallen chiefly on them. As events have happened, their property has re mained intact, and, beyond the temporary suspension of trade, and the inconveniences they have 174175 been subjected to, they have remained unaffected by the siege, a result, I venture to submit, that cannot but be considered satisfactory. “ His Highness has expressed his gratitude for the support given to him and has fired a salute of 31 guns in Her Majesty’s honour, in token of his appreciation of the favour he has received. On Sunday, the 2Hth, the llritish flag was flown all day on Merani fort, and His Highness paid a visit to H. M. S. Philomel to express his thanks in person to Captain Lang.” Government of India, to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 233-E., dated 731.

To his action may be attributed, in some measure, the success with which His Highness Sayyid Turki repulsed the attack upon Maskat, as well as the protection accorded to British Indian subjects residing at Maskat and Mattrah during the hostilities.” Government of India, to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 948-E., dated 15th April 1884.

On 7tli ^ioa ember Colonel Yliles reported ment of India, No. 226, dated 2^nd that the Sultan, finding that the forces which had collected to support him against Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salah numbered some 3,000 men, deter mined to send an expedition to follow the rebels, and to punish the disaffected Ghafiri tribes, who had given them passage through their defiles ; Colonel Miles, on being consulted, expressed approval of a demonstration. The command of the expedition was given to Sayyid Eaisal, the Sultan’s second son, who, with 1,800 men, left Ealaj on 3rd November for Semail. The instructions given him were of a moderate character. To meet the expense of the expedition Colo nel Miles advanced one monthly instalment of the Zanzibar subsidy, which Government approved. 733.

On the 10th Sayyid Faisal reached Semail, where the people tendered submission and offered to pay an indemnity if tlieir property were spared. The principal Shaikh^ of the Beni Ruahah waited upon him and were pardoned in consideration of a payment of $5,000. The Nidabiyeen Rahbiyeen retired to the Akk defile, where they were joined by Sayyid Abdul Azeez, with some of the Haboos from El Sharkiyeh. Shaikh Salah bin Ali came to the Jerdeh Valley to collect a force to help them, but failed to do so. By tbe 16th the Nidabiyeen and Rahbiyeen tired of their position in El Akk and tendered submission, which was accepted through the mediation of the Beni Bu Ali and Hishm, and they signed a document repudiating their recent alliance with the Hinawis, and promising loyalty to Sayyid Turki. They then gave notice to Sayyid Abdul Azeez to leave El Akk, which he did on the 19th. 734. The expedition having been thus far highly successful, Sayyid Turki determined to utilize it to reduce to subjection the Mawal of WadiMawal, who had been chronically hostile to him since his accession. Sayyid Faisal left Semnil for Wadi Mawal on 24th November. On his arrhal at FI Fulaij, the Harth and other Hinawi Shaikhs, who accompanied him, proceeded in advance, at their own desire, to induce Nasir bin Muhammad, Shaikh of the Mawal, to submit. They were successful, and were returning with Shaikh Nasir to meet Sayyid Faisal, who had reached the village of Ah, when an acci dental altercation occurred there between some of the expeditionary force and the Mawal, in which 5 of the former and 14 of the latter 'were killed. Shaikh Nasir and his tribe, exasperated at this incident, broke off the negocia- tions for their submission, hut, alter some discussion, Shaikh Nasir agreed to accompany Sayvid Faisal to Maskat and submit himself to Sayyid luikis pleasure,* the Shaikhs of the Beni Bu Ali guaranteeing that his life should not be taken. The expedition then returned to Maskat, where Shaikh Nasir was imprisoned pending payment of a tine of $12,000 by the Mawal. Ihe Sultan, having no further need of their services, then dismissed the contingents of tribes which had composed the expedition with presents to their homes. 735. Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior of Oman in 1883 : Wrecks of British ships on the coast— Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior, and the wrecks of two British ships on the coast are thus noted in the Administration Reports of the Maskat Agency:— “In January a figM took place near Ibra between El Harth and El Musakerah, in which 15 men w’ere killed on both sides. “Towards the end of that month a letter arrived from Suleiman bin Suweilim, Walt' of Dhofar, saving- that the people of Dhofar had besieged the fort and asking for reinforcements, and on the 17th February His Highness sent 70 men and a ten-pounder gun to Dhofar; but, in the meantime the fort having proved impregnable, the siege had been raised and the rein forcements were therefore sent back. “In May the Sultan attempted to renew negociations with Shaikh Hilal bin Zahir, of the Beni Hina, through the mediation of Hamood-El-Jabafi, for the surrender of the tort of Nezwa, which Hilal had promised before to deliver up for a certain sum, hut nothing came of it and the fort still remains in the possession of Hilal. “In July a collision occurred at Barkah between the Wahhabee garrison and the towns people resulting in two men being killed and six wounded. The townspeople, having been worsted, called in the aid of Mawalees, who came down and besieged the fort. The Wazir Sayyid Said however was despatched to Barkab in the Dar-ul-Salaam and effected a satisfac tory adjustment of the affair. « X n November Shaikh Bargash Temeemeh, of the Beni Ghafir tribe, and a man of some importance, was murdered at Bahila by his two brothers, who stabbed him while he was asleep, and then seized the fort. “ Notwithstanding his late reverse Shaikh Salih did not desist from intriguing among the tribes and endeavouring to organize another rising against the Sultan. He tried first with the Hejriyeen and then with tlie Beni Bu Hasan, hut failed to induce them to engage in hosti lities, and he has since remained tolerably quiet. “Two vessels were wrecked on the southern coast of Arabia during 1883. In the month of Auo*ust Major Mockler received information of .he crew of the S. S. Knight of the Bath, which ^had been wrecked at the Kooria Mooria Islands being at an Arab village near Ras, Sankirah, and, on the report reaching India, the Amberwitch was despatched to their rescue and they were taken to 'Bombay. In September the crew of the S. S. Airy arrived at Maskat in an Arab baghlah and were taken to ^Bombay. The Airy had struck near Ras Fartak and been stranded, but the whole of the crew were saved.' 736. Position of affairs on 1st January 1884. —At this date Sayyid Turki’s position was probably more secure, and bis authority greater than they bad been at any time since bis accession. The unexpected vigour which he 'displayed in expelling the attack on Maskat by the rebels under Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh bin Ali in the previous October, and the energy with w hich, under bis direction, that success was followed up bad condoned in public estimation the feebleness and apathy of bis rule in recent years, and very much surprised bis antagonists. Shaikh Salih bin Ali, it is true, defeated but not 176177 disheartened, at once resumed his habitual course of intrigue, and even attempt ed to organize another expedition of El Sharkiyeh fanatics and marauders against Maskat. Eut his efforts met with no response. Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais had, before the rebellion in October, avowed his determination to engage in no further enterprises against Sayyid Turki, and Sayyid Abdul Azeez, bank rupt in means and reputation, had ceased, for the time being, to be dangerous. There was peace throughout the country and some prospect of its continuing, for a moderate display of firmness in the Sultan has always sufficed to repress ’Omani sedition and turbulence. 737.

Raids of El Dhahirah tribes in El Batinah: request of Indian traders at Saham for protection—On the 1st April 1884, Colonel Miles reported that in consequence of numerous recent raids of El Dhahirah Bedou ins in El Batinah, the Indian traders at Saham had represented to him the insecurity of the bazaar of that town, which is unwalled. At the Political Agent’s request Sayyid Turki increased the garrison of Saham by 12 men, and directed his son, Sayyid Muhammad, the Governor of Sohar, to take any further precautionary measures that might be necessary for the protection of the traders.

Measures adopted by Sayyid Turki to recover possession of Zikki Fort from the disaffected Beni Ruaha, Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir: Political Agent’s censure of the Sultan’s bad faith approved by Government. —On 15th April, Colonel Miles reported that Sayyid Turki anxious to recover possession of the fort of Zikki from Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir of the Beni 11 naha, in whose charge it was and whose loyalty he suspected, invited him to visit Maskat. Shaikh Muhammad came as far as Semail, but was there dissuaded from proceeding fur- „ „ ir . „ - ther, and returned to Zikki.

Nos. i -- . p rom j se hi m safe conduct and good treatment, and the Wali, relying on the Sultan’s good faith accompanied the emissaries to Maskat, where he arrived on 19th May, and was at once thrown into prison. Colonel Miles wrote :— “ I have taken an opportunity t&lt;&gt; express my opinion to the Sultan, through the Wazi, Sayyid Said,•of the impolicy of His Highness violating his promise and cheapening his word before the country, for the sake of gaining an advantage over a tribal Shaikh, and I have pointed out that the acquisition of a comparatively unimportant fortress is but a poor compen sation for the loss of credit which His Highness will inevitably sustaiu in the eyes of Lis subject.” Government of India, to Resident, i « .r* j i &lt;• ,1 t Persian Gulf, No. 1760-E., dated loth Government signified approval of the disappro- juiy 1884. bation expressed by Colonel Miles.

Negociations with the imprisoned Shaikh resulted in his agreeing to give up the fort for $800, but, when Sayyid Turki’s officers went to take charge of it, the Beni Ruaha garrison received them with great indignation, and refused to yield the fort on any conditions whatever. 741. After prolonged negociations the fort was finally made over by the Beni lluaha on Sayyid Turki’s paying them $2,500, and Sulaiman bin Suailitn w r as appointed AVali with a garrison of 50 Arabs and slaves from Maskat.

This belief Colonel Miles attributed, in some measure, to the break-up of H. M. S. London at Zanzibar, and the removal of the naval establishment there for the suppression of the trade, and to General Gordon’s proclamation, permitting domestic slavery at Khartoum, whose tenor had been widely and inaccurately circulated among Arabs. 744. On 9th June the Political Agent reported that certain information had reached him of the landing of several cargoes of slaves at Soor, El Khadrah, and Sowaik on the coast of ’Oman. At the Political Agent’s instance Sayyid Turki issued a proclamation to his subjects warning them of the consequence of transgressing the orders in force against slave-trading. 745. On 13th October II. M. S. Philomel captured off Ras-ul-hadd an Arab dhow, hound from Dar El Salaam to El Khadrah on the Batinah coast with 154 slaves on board. The dhow was brought before the Vice-Admiralty Court at Maskat and condemned, and the slaves liberated. The Nakhoda had escaped to the shore before the capture was made, but six Arab passengers, owners of most of the slaves, were made over to the Sultan, who imprisoned them pending reference regarding their disposal to Government. Among the Nakhoda’s effects was found a packet of letters, regarding which Colonel Miles wrote :— “The information obtained from this correspondence confirms the reports that had before reached me, to the effect that a large importation of slaves has taken place this year from Zanzibar coast to Arabia. For the past ten years this slave transport by sea has been, without doubt, practically in abeyance, owing chiefly, I believe, to the vigilance and energy of the naval force engaged in patrolling the East African coast. Hut this check has lately been in a great measure removed, and a widespread belief has arisen among the Arabs that the former restrictions placed by the British Government on the slave trade have been withdrawn. The preventive measures adopted in his territories by the Sultan of Zanzibar are, in my humble opinion, neither sincere nor effective.” 746. On 18th October H. M. S. Philomel, while proceeding from Maskat v -A , T&gt; ■ n I n Aden, captured off Maseerah Islands another ReBident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- . meat of India, No. 215 , dated 28th dhow with 51 slaves on board.

The Nakhoda and four passengers, owners of the slaves, being Maskat subjects, were sent to Maskat and made over to the Sultan for punishment. 747. On 29th October the Residency Agent on the Arab const of the Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- ^ reported that large importations of ment of India, No. 205, dated 15 th Airican slaves into Oman had taken place.

The Resident directed the Political Agent to bring these circumstances to Sayyid Turki’s Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- knowledge. Colonel Miles, in reporting that he had ment of India.

At the Political Agent’s suggestion Sayyid Turki re-issued his pro- 178but the Sultan firmly declined to resume relations with Shaikh Salih. With reference to Shaikh Jumah’s submission Colonel Miles wrote:— “The visit of Shnikh .Tumah is considered by the Sultan and his advisers, as well as bv myself, as an indication that the influence of Shaikh Salih and the hostile party in the Sharkiyeh is very low, and that their power at present to unite the Arab tribes to aggression is at an end.” 752- Character of Sayyid Muhammad, Sayyid Turki’s eldest son — Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Colonel Miles, in reporting on 10th November that ment of India, No 207 , dated 17th Sayyid Muhammad, Sayyid Turki’s eldest son, had A. 1 , et 1884 , Nos. 189 . 182 . resigned the Governorship of Sohar, wrote “The Sultan is very averse from receiving Muhammad in Maskat, as he is apprehensive, I believe, of rebellious designs against his authority on the part of his son. Sayyid Muhammad has done his best to ruin Sohar by his incompetence and arbitrary government, and has disgusted all the inhabitants of that district. His removal from his present position is, in my opinion, a matter for congratulation, and l think Maskat is the most suitable residence that could he found for him, even should he entertain rebellious designs, as he will he well under surveillance here. 753.

By the Sultan's interven tion a truce was subsequently effected between the parties. • , «. “In March the Bedouins of El Dhahirah raided part of the Batinah and carried off a quantity of booty. ^ , . . . , x , . “ In April the Beni Battash, a powerful tribe in El Sharkiyeh, which had for some time been estranged, became reconciled to the Sultan. &lt;« Towards the end of May letters smd rumours reached Maskat of an intended rising on the part of the Sharkiyeh tribes under the leadership of Shaikh Salih. A raid on the Batinah coast was also contemplated by Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi, but these mischief-makers failed to receive the support they expected, and their schemes ultimately fell through. “In July a serious conflict took place between the Harth and Mesakireh tribes of El Shar kiyeh, which are constantly at feud, in which about twenty men were killed and wounded. “In September the Wazir Sayyid Said proceeded to Soor in the Dar ul-Salaam, and effected an arrangement with the Jenebeh about the payment of customs duties, and for the erection of a wall round the town. , . “ In October the fort of Sowaik was yielded up to the Sultan by Saood bin Sait El Kuahi, on payment of R500. About the same time Shaikh Hilal bin Zahir of Nezwa raided the Jen eh eh at Rakkeh, in the province of 'Oman and inflicted a loss of ten killed on that tribe. “In November negociations were renewed with Shaikh Hilal for the surrender of the foit of Nezwa, but they failed, as before. Shaikh Halal consented to receive the sum offered him, but, on the oflicers appointed by His Highness to receive charge of the fort appearing, they were refused admittance. ,. TT ,,o-n a a “ ] n December the Political Agent proceeded to Ras Fartak in H. M. S. Dragon to present rewards to the Sultan of Kisheen and the chiefs of Nistoon and Tibboot for their services in succouring the shipwrecked crew rf the S. S. Airy in the previous year. ... “ In the same month the new Shaikh of Ras-ul-Hadd was murdered at the instigation of the former Shaikh, and the Dar-ul-Salaam was despatched with a small force to punish the offenders and restore order.” Bushire ; The 1st July 1885.

Position of Affairs on 1st January 1885.— The year 1884 was a comparatively uneventful one in the history of Maskat. Sayyid Turki still maintained the strong position he had gained by the defeat of his brother, Sayyid Abdul Azeez, in 18S3; while the submission of Shaikh Jumah-bin-Sayyid El Meskeri and his attempt to obtain pardon for Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali in 1881 showed that the power of the hostile party in Sharkiyeh was at all events tem porarily broken. . 757. Sayyid Abdul Azeez writes requesting mediation of the Poli tical Agent between himself and the Sultan- —The increase of Sayyid Turki’s prestige was all the more apparent, when early in the month &lt; f January Colonel Miles received a letter from Sayyid Abdul Azeez requesting his good offices to effect a reconciliation between him and his brother. Abdul Azeez stated that he had been informed by Hamad-bin-Hamood in a letter written with the Sul tan’s authority, that Sayyid Turki himself was desirous of peace. His High ness disavowed the action of Hamad-bin-Hamood but admitted he was prepared to accept Colonel Miles* mediation, though he added that he could admit of no arrangement which did not provide for his brother’s banishment from Oman. 758. Colonel Miles in asking for orders requested that he should confine him- Poiiticai Agent, to Resident, Pergian self to forwarding the correspondence between the Sultan and Sayyid Abdul Azeez, a course which was sanctioned by the Resident in the Persian Gulf. 18th January Gulf, No. 27, dated 1885.

Abdul Azeez accepted Sayyid Turki’s terms on condition that his debts in Oman should be paid and a suitably large allowance made for his residence in India. Sayyid Turki however refused to pay liis debts and declared he would only allow for his residence in India the same sum as had previously been Paragraph, 488 to 493 s.pra. f &lt;’ r his maintenance, a monthly pension ot 8500. r60. Sayyid Abdul Azeez was not disposed to accept the above terms, and the correspondence was therefore allowed to cease. 701.

Visit of Political Agent and the Sultan’s Wazeer to Gwadur.— On 3rd March Colonel Miles and Sayyid Saeed, the Sultan’s Wazeer, sailed in Her Majesty’s Ship Dragon for Gwadur, in connection with the Court of Enquiry which assembled there by the orders of the Government of India to settle the long-vexed dispute between British and Arab subjects residing at Gwadur and the members of the Rind tribe in Baluchistan. • 764. The Court consisted of Colonel Miles, Colonel Reynolds, Political Agent, South-Eastern Baluchistan, and Mr. Efinek, Director of Telegraphs in the Persian Gulf, and Sayyid Saeed was deputed by His Highness the Sultan to represent the authority of the Maskat Government. 765. An amount of R5,216 was decreed by the Court in favour of Maskat subjects, and the award was confirmed by the Government of India. 766. The Junior Under-Secretary to the Government of India wrote as Government of India, to Resident, follows to the Resident in the Persian Gulf on September U i 885 No ’ 1470 ' E ’ dated 19lh the conclusion of the enquiry :— (Extl.

Defeat of the Wali of Zikki by Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahar El Sinawi near Eark. —Early in May the Sultan received news of a reverse suffered by the Wali of Zikki at the hands of Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahar near Fark. It appeared that the people of Fark had made overtures to Suliman-bin- Suwevlim, the Wali of Zikki, to hand over their fort which was in possession of Shaikh Bilal, to Say yid Turki. The Wali sent envoys, and the fort was delivered to them, but on the approach of Shaikh Bilal from Nezwa the envoys abandoned their position. The Wali meanwhile had advanced and met Shaikh llilal s force, by which he was defeated with a loss of three or four men. 768. Sayyid Turki considered that the Wali had behaved injudiciously. 769. Attack on Behla by the Yaarebeh and Ibriyeen tribes.—On 24th May Colonel Miles reported that a political movement of some importance was taking place in Oman at Behla, where the heirs of the Yaarebeh dynasty, in conjunction with the Ibriyeen tribes, were engaged in besieging that fortress. He considered that the movement had been initiated by Shaikh Salim-bin- Badr El Ibri, who under pretence of Attempting to take the fort in behalf of the Sultan was really actuated by a spirit of revenge for the murder of his father and grandfather by Shaikh Bargash and Hamad-bin-Mohsin in 1881, and by a desire to wrest the place from the power of the Ghafiris. On 26th May the Sultan received news of the collapse of the siege and the successful defence of the fort by its holder Shaikh Nasir-bin-Hameyd. 770. Rumours of rising by Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh against Maskat, and adoption of a definite policy by the Government of India towards His Highness Sayyid Turki.—In August the rumours that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali were about to attack Maskat, which had been rife for some months, became so strong that Sayyid Turki took the precaution to close the passes, and Colonel Miles addressed His Highness to take measures to protect the life and property of British subjects on the coast.

Government of India as follows :— u In view to the large commercial interests at stake, the general friendly relations existing between the British Government and Sayyid Turki, and the active support which has already on some occasions been accorded him by Government, I would now suggest that a definite line of policy should be adopted as regards attacks on Matrah and Maskat, and that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and the other insurrectionary leaders should be informed that even in the event of their gaining possession of those towns temporarily they would be driven out by the British (Govern ment and Sayyid Turki replaced in possession.^ Colonel Ross was of opinion that such an intimation would put a stop to the frequent risings and scares to which Oman was liable. 772. The Government of India in reply described the above suggestion as Government of imiin, to Kesident, a change of policy and feared that it might commit Se^temb?r U i885.°’ dated lhth them to the necessity of “propping up by force of (Exti. a, Mar. 1886, Nos. 142152 .) arms ” a ruler who had already proved his failure, and “ involve the support of a Sultan de jure who could not hold liis own without that support.*’ They said that the policy of the Government of India Jiad always been “ to abstain from mixing with dynastic disputes, to support the de facto ruler, and to assist him in quelling tribal disturbances; ’* they accordingly invited a further consideration of the question. 773. Colonel Ross expressed his views more fully in answer. He ex- Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- plained that the Suggestion WaS not SO much a ment of India, No. 157, dated 7th r , , VP • c ,, . . /. ^ October 1885. change as a strengthening of the existing policy, (Exti. a, Mar. 1886 , Nos. 142 - 152 .) and that it would apply only in the case of Sayyid Turki and not in regard to future Sultans or Sayyid Turki’s children. He laid stress on the fact that we were bound in honour to support Sayyid Turki by force of arms if necessary, and on the necessity for such support, if given at all, being thorough. He added that the mere fact of an intimation such as he had suggested, would in itself, as far as could be foreseen, deter the leaders of rebellion from further attempts against Sayyid Turki’s power. V *Political Agent, to Resident, Per sian Gulf, No. 290, dated 17th October 1885. (Extl. A, March 1886, Nos. 142-152.) of Colonel Ross. 774. The Political Agent, Colonel Miles, was also requested to express his views. Colonel Miles wrote that his own views were in unison with those 775. The Government of India’s orders (not received till the following year) were in the following terms :— Government of India, to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 276-E, dated 9th February 1886. (Extl. A, March 1886, Nos. 142-152.) “* * * the Government of India repose confidence in your knowledge of the situation and in the soundness of your judgment. They have there fore decided to follow your recommendations. You are authorised to announce to the Sultan, his rivals and his enemies at such' time and in such manner as you may think fit, that the British Government has for special reasons resolved to uphold Sayyid Turki in repelling unprovoked aggression during his life-time. But His Highness should clearly understand that the active support of the British Govern ment will be given to him specially and will not necessarily be continued to his children, heirs or successors, the normal policy of Government towards Maskat being one of non-interfer ence in dynastic struggles or internal administration.'” Due effect was given to these orders. 776. In a further communication on this subject the Government of India said— “ The correspondence has been reported to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, and His Lordship now wishes it to be understood that our support will only be continued so long as His Highness conducts his administration in a manner not unsatisfactory to the Government of India.” Government of India, to Resident 1 No. 1763-E, dated 31st July 1886. (Extl. A, Sept. 1886, Nos. 216-222.) 777. Proposed visit of His Highness Sayyid Turki to Mecca —On 28th July His Highness informed Colonel Miles privately that he had long cherished the idea of proceeding to Mecca to perform the religious obligations imposed on all Moslems; and that he considered a suitable time had arrived for carrying out his project. 778. Colonel Miles pointed out to His Highness the difficulties and Political Agent, to Resident, Persian dangers of the plan and reported his arguments in G ?ExfL°i! sV^If'^XOT.) 85 ' tlie followin S terms : ~ Not only his brother Sayyid Abdul Azeez, I remarked, but Sayyid Ibrahim, Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali and every disaffected chief in the country would fly to arms on his departure, and the whole of Oman would become a prey to civil war and anarchy, which his sons, who were still mere children, would probably be unable to contend against, and in which the chief sufferers would be the peaceful Indian traders, the subjects of the British Government. I also pointed out to His Highness that, considering our friendly relations and the circumstances of his position, it would liardly be in • accordance with the courtesy and respect due to the British Government for him to leave Maskat on a distant journey without first communicating his intentions to His Excellency the Viceroy of India.” 779. Sayyid Turki after some consideration acknowledged the cogency Government of India, to Resident, of Colonel Miles’ objections and abandoned his journey. The Government of India considered the advice tendered by Colonel Miles to His Highness Persian Uulf, No. 1382-E., dated 3rd September 1885. (Extl. A, Sept. 1885, Nos. 85-87.) the Sultan was judicious. 780. —Increase of tax on produce brought from interior to the coast for exportation.—On 16th August the Political Agent reported that His Highness desired to raise the tax on produce brought to the coast from the interior for exportation to one of 5 per cent, ad valot'em, on the ground of the rise in price of dates in recent years. Colonel Miles said— “This tax is, properly speaking, recoverable from the Arab producers, but as a matter of fact it is only in rare cases that His Highness is able to collect Political ^® nt ’ it from the tribes, and he therefore prefers to recover it 1 g 8 5 * °‘ ’ ‘ through his customs farmer from the Indian traders settled in fF-H A Dec 1885 Nos 129 131) various ports along the coast who purchase the fruit from * ’ ’ ‘ ‘ the Arabs.” 781. Colonel Ross in referring the matter to Government wrote— “ It appears to me that if the British Government considered it expedient it could under Resident. Persian Gulf, to Govern- ^ terms of the treaty claim exemption for British subjects from any tax of - the sort discussed; but it was decided by the Government of India that the treaty should not be considered applicable, and that the former moderate tax should not be 185 ment of India, No. 135, dated 26th August 1885. (Extl. A, Dec. 1885, Nos. 129-131.)interfered with. The proposed levy of 5 per cent, ad valorem ,seems tome, would constitute a serious innovation, and I think may justly be objected to by Government if it is considered expedient to do so.” 782. The Government of India held that the tax was in reality an export Government of Lidia, to Resident, tax, and that it might certainly be argued that the Persian Gulf, No. 1759-E., dated 5th Sultan was precluded from imposing such a duty by the terms of the Commercial Treaty with the (Exti. a, Dec. 1885, Nos. 129 - 131 .) British Government. But they added that— “ Even if this view of our rights were capable of being upheld upon the strict interpreta tion of the treaties, yet it would be more reasonable with regard to the equity of the case to look upon the treaties as making no stipulations as to export duties. Provideu that British subjects are not treated worse in this respect than Muscat subjects, or than the subjects of the most favoured nation, nothing more appears to be necessary. It would hardly be fair to the Sultan to insist upon his imposing no duty at all in the case of the goods exported bv British subjects.” 783. The Government of India considered it inexpedient accordingly to interfere with the 5 per cent ad valorem tax, but directed that the Political Agent should point out to the Sultan that it was obviously against his interests to tax exports at such rates as to divert trade to other ports, and to further inform him that the Government of India had no wish to press their treaty claims to freedom from all export duty, so long as the rate imposed was reason ably low. 784. Sayyid Turki on being informed of the orders of Government remit ted all other taxes in favour of the new one of 5 per cent, ad valorem, and noti fications to the British Indian traders at the various ports were issued by the Political Agent. 785. Affray between Beni Ghafir and Ibriyeen tribes in the Wady Santani near Rostak. —A serious fight occurred in September be tween the Beni Ghafir and the Ibriyeen tribes in the Wady Sahtani. The Wady had been for some time in the joint occupation of both tribes, but a feud existed between them, and the result of this contest was to give the Beni Ghafir the supremacy of the valley. The political effect of the affair was to increase Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis’ authority in the Rostak district, as the Beni Ghafir were Ids strongest supporters, and indeed the defeat of the Ibri yeen was looked on as a reverse for Sayyid 'i urki, with whom the latter tribe was in alliance. 786. Complaints of British Indian traders at Matrah regarding the weighment Of dates- —In September complaints were made to the Pol£ tical Agent by the British Indian traders at Matrah that attempts were being made by the customs farmer and agents of the Sultan to compel them to take all dates purchased by them to Maskat for weighment, a procedure which entailed much unnecessary expense on them. 787. Colonel Miles addressed His Highness on the subject and pointed out that such interference with free trade was contrary to treaty stipula tions. 788. His Highness promised to remove the cause of complaint, but some days having elapsed without a withdrawal of the objectionable prohibition, Colonel Miles addressed a further remonstrance to His Highness which had the desired effect. 789- Slave Trade— Her Majesty’s Ship Osprey arrived at Maskat on 19th September with a cargo of 72 slaves taken in a dhow off Ras-el-Had. The case was tried in the Vice-Admiralty Court and the whole batch con demned, In October another dhow and seven slaves captured by Her Majesty’s ship Hanger at Soor were condemned. A Political Aprent to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 321, dated 2-ltb November 1885. (Extl. A, April 1886, Nos. 103-124A.) tions :— 790. Colonel Miles made the following remarks in a report to the Resident in the Persian Gulf re garding the working of the slave trade opera- “ Besides rescuing and restoring to freedom a number of wretched creatures, the opera tions have been of value in determining two points. One of these is that the East African 186 —5 u187 slave trade has revived and is now again in full swing, confirming the opinion I had formed from information gleaneJ from Arabic correspondence found in the captured dhows, from observing the fall in the price of slaves, and from local reports. The other point on which 1 am now satisfied is that the bulk of the slaves are exported from Zanzibar during the spring of the year, when the dhows run up during the first monsoon breezes.” 791. Eunning amok and subsequent suicide of Sepoy Husein Bux of the Political Agency Guard. —In September Husein Bux, a sepoy of the Guard of the Marine Battalion stationed at Maskat for the protection of the Treasury, &amp;c., ran amok. Possessing himself of a lifle and several rounds of ammunition he paraded the narrow streets of the town. After firing at a woman in one of the houses without effect, he met a Negro slave belonging to His Highness the Sultan, whom he shot, killing him on the spot. By this time the Havaldar of the guard, without attempting the man’s capture him self, reported the matter to Colonel Miles, who at once proceeded in person to effect his arrest. Husein Bux, however, on seeing Colonel Miles, threw him self into the sea under Fort Zerani, and weighted as he was with his rifle and ammunition, sank immediately. When his body was recovered life was extinct. The evidence showed that the unfortunate man was suffering from the effects of ganja. The conduct of the Havaldar of the guard was so strongly dis approved by the military authorities in India that he was dismissed the service for cowardice. 792, Inter-tribal disputes and minor occurrences in 1885— Inter tribal disputes, &amp;c., are noted as follows in the Administration Reports :— “ Some disturbances occurred at this time (February) in the vicinity of Sohar between the Beni bu AH and Mokabil tribes, and the mediation of the new Wali of Sohar, Sayyid Hamad, was sought by both parties. “On 31st March a hurricane struck the Batineh Coast between Seeb and Mesnaah and extended inland as far as Rostak, destroying many thousands of date trees and causing a loss of several lives. Heavy rain fell simultaneously all over Oman, causing immense damage to houses, crops and trees. In June, news was received that an insurrection had taken place at Dofar, which was confirmed in October by the Wali, Ali-bin Suliman, together with the Arab garrison, coming to Maskat; they having been expelled by the inhabitants of Dofar from whom, however, letters were received in which their friendship for, and allegiance to, His Highness Sayyid Turki was expressed, while stating that they had been uuable to endure the oppression of his Wali. “ In July the Beni Hina were attacked by the Awamir, with whom they were at feud, in the vicinity of Seeb, and three of their number killed ; they retaliated by destroying some $20,000 worth of date property belonging to the Awamir at Khotti, upon which the Awamir assisted by the Wali of Mesnaah, Ali-bin-Salim El Amiri, and the Wali of Burkha, Sayyid- bin-K.hamis El Amiri, again attacked the Beni Hina, but were repulsed with a loss of seven killed. On the news reaching Maskat His Highness Sayyid Turki sent his son Sayyid Feysal to Seeb, to enquire into the matter; but before his arrival, a truce for one year had been arranged by the Shaikhs of Semail. “In August Sayyid Feysal and Fahd proceeded in the S. S. Dar-as-Salam to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenibeh, but were unsuccessful. In the same mouth a party of Mokabil raided the district of Majaz near Sohad and lifted some camels, but were promptly followed and reduced to submission by the Wali of Sohar, Hamad-bin-Nasir. “ In November a serious collision occurred in the Sharkeyeh between the Mesakereh on the one side and the Harth, Hijriyeen, Rejeybi, and El Wahibah on the other, in which 60 or 70 men were killed. Ali-bin-Salim El Amiri was despatched by His Highness the Sultan to mediate between the parties, in which mission he was successful. “ In December the Political Agent, Colonel Miles, made an interesting tour of 20 days through Oman and the Dahireh country and was received everywhere with great courtesy and cordiality.” 793- Position of affairs on 1st January 1886 .—The country was at this time more peaceful than usual, and Sayyid Turki’s position was shortly to be considerably strengthened by the decision of the Government of India to give him active support when necessary. His Highness was also informed in Janu ary that Her Majesty the Queen had been graciously pleased to confer upon him the Insignia of a G.C.S.L 794. Attempt to assassinate the Prime Minister.—On the evening of 4th January Sayyid Saeed was fired at while returning to his house by an African slave. The bullet struck him in the shoulder, inflicting happily a slight188 Mm flesh wound only. The would-be assassin, after firing the shot, threw the pistol away and made good his escape, the Minister’s single attendant failing to arrest him. The pistol was found to be one belonging to Sayyid Saeed himself, and the affair was believed to be due to harem intrigues. 795. Complaints of oppression by the Khoja traders of Khabureh against the Wali of Sohar. —The Khoja merchants of Khabureh complained in January to the Political Agent of ill-treatment at the hands of Sayyid Hamad-biu-Nasir, Wali of Sohar. The Wali, hey said, had attempted to exact a forced loan of $100 from them, and had hindered their trading operations on their refusal to pay. He had also imposed an extra tax of 2 per cent, on their purchases, and had imprisoned without cause one of their community. Sayyid Turki promised to enquire into these complaints, and wrote shortly after to Colonel Miles in extenuation of the Wall’s conduct. Colonel Miles, however, was of opinion that Sayyid Hamad-bin-Nasir was in reality guilty of the offences charged against him, and advised His Highness that he was hardly a fit man for the position of Wali. His Highness, on further enquiry, agreed to pay $100 as compensation to the traders for their losses and the imprisonment of one of their number, and ordered the appointment of another Wali for Khabureh. Political Agent to Resident, Persian Colonel Miles in reporting the matter to the Resi- 1886 N ° 48, datea 14th Febluary dent said : “The Wazir Sayyid Saeed has taken an (Exti. a, April 1586, Nos. 65-77). active part in endeavouring to screen the Wali Sayyid Hamad and excuse his conduct.” Government of India to Resi lent, Persian Gulf, No. 10i&gt;6-E., dated 29th Way 1886. (Extl. A, June 1886, Nos 86-89.) 796- The Government of India approved of the action Colonel Miles had taken. 797. Attempt to seduce the Wazeer from his allegiance to the Sultan —On 4th March Sayyid Saeed, the Prime Minister, received a letter from Sayyid Abdul Azeez, inviting him to join his cause and promising him ample rewards. This letter was at once shown to His Highness, whose first impulse was to send his brother a rough answer. It is probable, however, that on Sayyid Saeed’s recommendation an answer was sent containing no reference to the proposal. 798. Visit of Resident in the Persian Gulf —On 2nd April Colonel Ross visited Maskat, and after an interview with His Highness Sayyid Turki left for India to take up the apjiointment of Resident at Hyderabad. Colonel Miles took charge of the office of Resident in the Persian Gulf and Colonel Mockler of that of Political Agent and Consul at Maskat. 799- Present of a Steamer to His Highness the Sultan from his brother the Sultan of Zanzibar —On 27 th April the S. S. Sultanee arrived in Maskat, having been sent as a present to his brother by Sayyid Par gash, Sultan of Zanzibar. 800. Execution of the Shaikh of the Beni Battash— On the 8th May Muhammad-bin-Shinas, Shaikh of the Beni Battash, visited Maskat. On arrival he was seized and imprisoned by order of His Highness, and the follow ing day was put to death. No reason could be assigned for this deed, except that he was a turbulent character and had recently been giving much trouble. 801- Slave Trade- —a dhow was brought into Maskat for adjudication by Her Majesty’s Ship Reindeer on 29th May. She had been captured off Ras Madraka and had two suspected slaves on board. After enquiry the Vice- Admiralty Consular Court released the dhow. The suspected slaves were proved to be khalasies kidnapped at the vessel’s port of departure. 802. On 16th June Her Majesty’s Ship Woodlark captured a dhow with 21 slaves on board off Ras-el Had. The Consular Court condemned this vessel and released all the slaves. 803. Proposal to annex to Maskat, Khor Fakan and certain other ports. —I n June Hamad-bin-Nasir, Wali of Sohar 3 reported to His Highness189 that the people of Khor Fakan, Dibba and Wadi-al-Hilloo, wished to he taken under the protection of the Maskat Goyernment. 804. Sayyid Turki requested the Political Agent to obtain the advice of the Resident, Colonel Miles, as to the annexation of these ports. 805. Colonel Miles wrote :— Resident, Persian Gulf, to Political Agent, No. Ill, dated 6th July 1886. (Extl. A, July 1886, Nos. 307-311.) highly unadvisable, and would His Highness's interests.' * * * “ any aggressive enternrises of the kind on the part of H is Highness Sayyid Turki against his neighbours the Jowas- mi, with whom he is now at peace, would be, in my opinion, probably, if undertaken, terminate in results very injurious to 806. Sayyid Turki acting on this advise directed his Wali to abstain from any acts of interference with the places concerned. Government of India, to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 1696-E., dated 27th July 1886. (Extl. A, July 1886, Nos. 307-311.) 807. The Government of India approved of the advice tendered by the Resident. 808. Alleged imprisonment of a Khoja woman at Muttrah by the Political Agent and subsequent release by the Sultan. —In January of this year a petition was addressed by certain Khojas to the Government of Bombay. The petitioners stated that about 400 Khojas, who formerly belonged to the Shia Ismaeli sect, had recently seceded from their faith and were now resorting to cruelty and oppression to induce their wives to follow them, in which course they were being strongly supported by the Sultan of Maskat; that a case of torture had come before the Political Agent, who had sentenced the husband to one year’s imprisonment, and that the man had then been released by the Sultan. 809. The Political Agent was requested to report the facts of this case after inquiry. Colonel Mockler’s investigation discredited the petitioner’s story in toto, and shewed that the case of torture was mythical. The Resident in report ing to Government said— “ The statement that a Khoja, sentenced to a year's imprisonment by the British Consul, had been released by the Sultan, has been explained by one of the petitioners to Colonel Mockler to have been written under a misapprehension by the English writer of the petition. I need hardly observe that it has never occurred, within my experience at Maskat, that the Local Government has attempted to interfere directly or indirectly with any punishment inflicted at the Consulate on a British subject. His Highness Sayyid Turki is not at all likely to make such a mistake.' • 810. Presentation of Insignia of Gr. C. S. I. to His Highness Sayyid Turki. —On the 11th July Colonel Miles, the Resident, arrived at Maskat to present the Insignia of the G.C.S. I. to His Highness Sayyid Turki. A Dar- bar was held for the purpose on the 13th idem, at which the Naval officers on the station, the American Consul, and most of the principal chiefs of Oman were present. Advantage was taken of the opportunity offered by this Darbar to again inform His Highness, in a more formal and public fashion, that the Government were prepared to actively support him against his enemies. Sayyid Turki had invited his brother Sayyid Abdul Azeez to be present on the auspi cious occasion, and guaranteed his safety while in Maskat. Abdul Azeez, how ever, required a guarantee of protection by the British Government, and ad dressed the Political Agent accordingly. The Political Agent and Resident con curred in thinking it unadvisable to involve the Government in the guarantee without distinct orders. The Government of India wrote as follows on this point:— “ The Government of India regret that Abdul Azeez was not induced to come in on the Government of India, to Resident, occasion of the recent Darbar, and they are inclined to think Persian Gulf, No. 2044-E., dated 2nd that, having regard to the proved loyalty of Sayyid Turki, September 1886. ^ m jght n0 ^ l iave been undesirable for the Political Agent to (Extl. a, Sept. 1886, Nos. 133-14?.) gj ve ^be required guarantee, first obtaining Sayyid Turki's consent. They fully understand your reasons for taking a contrary view, and have no wish whatever to convey disapproval of your action ; but if a similar opportunity should again occur, the Governor-General in Council would desire you to reconsider the possibility of meeting the wishes of Abdul Azeez without risk of embarrassing consequences. If you are still of opinion that it would be imprudent to give a guarantee, you should act upon your own judgment in the matter.'190 811. Rumours of attack on Maskat. —The following telegram was sent on 1st October from the Political Agent to the Resident:— “ Letters received 27th September from Shaikh of Rahabeen that Saleh-bin-Ali and all Hinawees had sent a messenger to him demanding passage through Kahza Pass, intending to attack Maskat, seeing it had few defenders. On 28th letter received that Abdul Azeez had gone with Haboos to Beni Battash. I detained Woodlark here. Letters received to-day that rising has collapsed from want of unanimity among the leaders.” 812. United States Consul. —Mr. A. Mackirdy, of Messrs. Towell and Co., relieved Mr. L. Maguire of the same firm in the post of United States Consul on 1st October. 813- Sajryid Abdul Azeez writes demanding an interview with the Prime Minister. —On 13th October letters were received by the Wazeer Sayyid Hilal-bin-Ahmad and Sayyid Mahomed-bin-Azzan from Sayyid Abdul Azeez at Hajir, where he had arrived with 200 men. Abdul Azeez demanded an interview with the above-named persons, and threatened to destroy their pro perty in the vicinity of Hajir should they refuse to meet him. 814. A force was sent against Abdul Azeez by the Sultan, which met with some resistance on the way, but found Hajir evacuated on arrival. 815. Resident in Persian Gulf and Political Agent.—Colonel Ross passed through Maskat on 24th October on bis way to Bushire to take up the appointment of Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Colonel Mockler was relieved at Maskat by Colonel Miles, who took charge of the Political Agency on 6th November. 816. Inter-tribal disturbances and minor events in 1886.— Inter tribal disputes, &amp;c., are thus narrated in the Administration Reports of the Maskat Agency :— &lt;( In April Muhammad and Murash, sons of Nasir-bin-Seif, former Shaikh of the Beni Riam, were put to death by their uncle, Suleiman-bin-Seif, at Nezwa, he fearing that they would wrest from him the Shaikhdom ; the other two sons made their escape. ‘'On 28th July His Highness Sayyid Turki, accompanied by his son, Sayyid Muhammad, started for a trip into the interior and was absent for a week. His Highness had not visited the interior for many years. “In September it was reported that the Hinawees had determined to rise, with the object of establishing the Sultan's brother, Sayyid Abdul Azeez, at Soor, or making war on the Ghafri tribe of Jaalan. It was also reported that Sayyid Abdul Azeez had gone with a party of the Haboos to the Beni Battash country. The Beni Battash attacked the fort of Kurryat, but were repulsed with loss. They looted the store rooms of a Bannia of about §250 worth of goods. Reinforcements were sent to Kurryat under command of Sayyid Badr-bin Seif. “ In October the Beni Battash having become divided in their councils, Sayyid Abdul Azeez, who had gone to their assistance with some of the Haboos, left their country. «* * * a f orce 0 { gome 1,200 men which was subsequently augmented by 25 horse And one gun, was sent by sea to Kurryat, under command of Sayyid Badr-bin-Seif and the Sultan's sons to coerce the Beni Battash. On 23rd instant news was received that the force had been opposed by the Beni Battash at Mizfah, who had been routed with a loss of seven men. The force subsequently destroyed the town of Mizfah and razed Mazara, the principal fort of the Beni Battash, who tendered their submission and offered to pay a fine of $10,000. “ His Highness Sayyid Turki sent a present of six horses to Her Majesty the Queen Empress. “ In November the force sent against the Beni Battash returned bringing with them the Shaikh Adi-bin-Nasir and six others, who were immediately on arrival imprisoned until the fiue should be paid. They were subsequently released on payment of $ 1,000.” 817. Position of affairs on 1st January 1887 —The year 1886 had been a comparatively peaceful one for Oman, though, as already shewn, it was by no means uneventful as far as His Highness Sayyid Turki was personally concerned. Matters were indeed unusually quiet, and the Sultan’s feeling of security considerably augmented. Signs were, however, unfortunately not want ing thrit Sayyid Turki’s health was failing, and the occasional restlessness of his character was beginning to be piore marked.818. Raids by Bedouins on Batineh Coast. —About the middle of January disturbances began to occur on the Batineh Coast, where the Beni Kattah, El Awamir and other predatory tribes committed some depreda tions in the vicinity of Shinas and Sohar. The Banian traders of the former place complained to the Political Agent that they had suffered losses to the extent of $400 in paying blackmail, and were apprehensive of danger to life and property. Her Majesty’s Ship Osprey was requested to call at Shinas on her way to Jask and afford protection to British subjects if necessary. His Highness the Sultan took the needful steps to subdue the marauders and com pensated the Banians for their losses. Colonel Miles, the Political Agent, attri buted the raids to the absence from his post of the Wali of Sohar, Sayyid Hamad-bin-Nasir, who was subsequently dismissed by the Sultan, Sayyid Hamad Wad Samar being appointed in his stead. from 0 ' PoHtS fi A%nt/T a [LS 819 ' Colonel Miles remarked in his report of the Persian Gulf. OCCUlTence that (Extl. A, April 1887, Nos. 120-129.) “ The warlike and predatory Bedouins can be kept quiet by two agents only—fear or money ; and when they are not kept in check by one or pacified by the other, they are sure to become restless and look out for plunder . &gt;l 820- Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen- —The 16th February was observed in Maskat as a day of celebration in honor of the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress of India. His Highness the Sultan caused an Imperial salute of 101 guns to be fired, which was returned by a salute of 21 guns from Her Majesty’s Ship Osprey. During the course of the day His High ness held a grand Darbar at his palace, at which the Political Agent, the Agency Surgeon, and the captain and officers of the Osprey were present. A kharita was handed to His Highness from the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and Sayyid Turki in reply took occasion to express his sincere gratifi cation in being able to take part in celebrating the 50th year of Her Majesty’s reign and his gratitude for the many favours he had received from the British Government during his own. He also stated that he had despatched a tele gram of congratulation direct to Her Majesty. 821. Throughout the day the flagstafFs at the palace, on the forts, at the British and American Consulates were dressed with flags, as were also Her Majesty’s Ship Osprey and all the ships in the harbour. In the evening the palace, the Political Agency, the hospital, the houses of the Indian merchants and the whole front of the town, as well as Her Majesty’s Ship Osprey were brilliantly illuminated, and a display of fireworks took place from the palace. 822. On the following day His Highness Sayyid Turki paid the Political Agent the honour of a visit, and repeated his congratulations on the occasion, and in the evening there were further illuminations and displays of fireworks. All classes concurred spontaneously in observing the occasion as a general holiday, the customs house being closed and no business transacted for two days, while large numbers of poor were fed by the Sultan and the Indian merchants. The latter community also despatched a telegram to Her Majesty conveying their respectful felicitations. 823- Complaints of the Fadthli Sultan against Maskat subjects pearl-fishing in his waters- —En March the Political Resident at Aden addressed the Political Agent regarding a complaint made by the Fadthli Sultan against subjects of Maskat for fishing for pearls in the waters of that Chief without permission or payment of fees. General Hogg suggested that steps should be taken to prohibit the practice. 824. Colonel Mockler, the Political Agent, in reply, pointed out that a similar complaint had been made in 1882, when it had been explained that from time immemorial the Arabs of these parts had fished in the waters re ferred to, and that since then no further objections had been made. 825. Colonel Mockler further said that the greater portion of the pearl- divers, who visited the South Arabian coast, were [stated to be natives, not of Maskat, hut of places in the Persian Gulf, and suggested reference being made, if necessary, to the Resident at Bushire. 191192 z 826. Political Agent—On 16th April Colonel Mockler relieved Colonel Miles as Political Agent and Consul, on the appointment of the latter to he Resident at Oudeypore. 827. Boats of Her Majesty’s Ship “Kingfisher” fired at— Two boats of Her Majesty’s Ship Kingfisher, which were lying at anchor at Soor, were fired at during the night of 15th April. On the first shot being fired the lights were put out, but a second shot falling close to the boats, they were obliged to put to sea for safety. A third shot was fired but fell short. Fortunately no damage was done. 828. The matter on being represented to the Sultan was duly enquired into, but no information as to the offenders was elicited. 829. Slave Trade.— On 22nd May a dhow was seized by the 1 boats of Her Majesty’s Ship Kingfisher. Four slaves who were on board had been landed at Karryat previous to the seizure. The dhow was condemned by the Consular Court. 830. Capture of the Fort of Birket El Moze by Shaikh Suleunan- bin-Seif.—Parly in June news was received in Maskat that, through the treachery of some’of the garrison, the Fort of Birket El Moze had been captured by Shaikh Suleiman-bin-Seif El Riyamee assisted by the Nizari Arabs of Zikki. The Wali of the Fort, Shaikh Saeed-bin-Sultan El Ameyree, was expelled, and Suleiman-bin-Seif being unopposed advanced on Zikki, taking possession of tbe principal roads leading to that place. Sayyid Turki on hearing of these events at once despatched Sayyid Hamood-bin-Nasir to reinforce the garrison at Zikki. Sayyid Hamood, however, was too late and was obliged to retire to Semail, leav ing Shaikh Suleiman in possession of the town of Zikki and in preparation to attack the fort. 831. More effective, however, was the apprehension of three Nizar Shaikhs who happened to he at Maskat at the time, an act which Suleiman-bin-Seif cleverly tried to turn to his own account by imputing to it the cause for his advance on Zikki. On the release of one of the Shaikhs, Sayyid Nasir-bin-Mu- hammad, Shaikh Suleiman retired from Zikki. 832. Notwithstanding the disloyal and rebellious nature of Shaikh Sulei man’s conduct, he w as pardoned by the Sultan on pleading the oppression exer cised by the Wali of Birket El Moze upon the widow and sons of Sayyid Muhammad-bin-IIil 1 al as his excuse for the aggression. The incident forms a good example of the leniency of Sayyid Turki’s rule. 833. Supply of garrison guns to His Highness the Sultan— The guns in Forts Merani and Jellali being useless for defensive purposes, Sayyid Turki requested to be supplied by the British Government with twelve 12- pounder guns on payment. Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 139, dated 23rd June 1887. Government of India, to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 1644-E., dated 11th August 1887. (Ext!. A, Nov. 1887, Nos. 17-24.) S3E The Government of India, at the suggestion of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, sanctioned the supply of the guns from India with the necessary carriages and ammunition gratis. 835. Capture of Suweikby Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis. —Following closely on the capture of Birket El Moze, and while matters were in the un satisfactory condition brought about by that event, news arrived that Suweik had been surprised and taken by Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis. This was an affair of much greater importance than the former, inasmuch as it formed the prelude to a general and concerted plan of coalition and rebellion against the ruling power, among the Hinawfi tribes under the leadership of Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali. This rebel, encouraged by Shaikh Suleiman’s success, opened a correspondence with that Chief and endeavoured to .w r in him over to the Hinawi cause, while it was hoped that blow ? s could be struck at several places along the line simultaneously. 836. Sayyid Turki, on hearing of the fall of Suweik, at once requested the assistance of a British man-of-war and asked that fire might be opened against Savvid Ibrahim’s force.193 837. Dr. Jayakar, Agency Surgeon, who then happened to be in tem porary charge of the Agency, did not feel justified in acceding to this demand and telegraphed to the Resident at Bushire- He further requested Her Majesty’s Ship Ranger to proceed to Suweik to remove British subjects, a course in which Sayyid Ibrahim himself afforded great assistance. 838. Colonel Ross telegraphed to the Government of India for permission to render armed assistance if found necessary. The Government of India replied that they were reluctant to engage in active operations on the Batineh Coast, but authorised the Resident to adopt such measures as appeared to him desirable. 839. Colonel Ross accordingly, accompanied by Colonel Mockler, Political Agent, went to Maskat in Her Majesty’s I. M. Ship Lawrence and interviewed the Sultan, who had made but feeble preparations to eject Sayyid Ibrahim himself, though he was extremely anxious that the British Government should employ active force to that end. He was, however, persuaded that mediation would, if successful, be better than force, and deputed his Wazeer Sayyid Saeed -to accompany Colonel Ross to Suw T eik. His Highness also agreed to restore to Ibrahim the allowance of $100 per mensem if he retired peaceably, on condition of holding aloof in the future from dissension and rebellion. At Suweik Colonels Ross and Mockler had an interview with Sayyid Ibrahim, who explained that his motive in seizing Suweik had been to relieve the inhabitants at their own request of the tyranny of Sayyid Turki’s people. Colonel boss replied that he did not consider Sayyid Ibrahim responsible for Sayyid Turki’s administration, and in view of the friendly relations between the Sultau and the British Government, the latter could not see with indifference any re bellious attempts against the authority of the former. He added, that if Sayyid Ibrahim would not withdraw peacefully, active interference from the British Governmeut would become necessary. Sayyid Ibrahim finding his position awkward replied that he was unaware that such strong support would be given to Sayyid Turki, and promised to withdraw from the situation. 840. The force with Sayyid Ibrahim on this occasion was seen to he very small, consisting of 200 or 300 men at most and his own following from Rostak. The Yal Sad tribe of the Batineh had invited him to come, hut their principal Shaikhs had afterwards drawn off. Sayyid Ibrahim wished to make conditions with the Resident before evacuating Suweik, but he was informed that he should treat with the Sultan’s Wazir; he was eventually permitted to leave the place on the evening of 12th July, and Suweik was again garrisoned by the Sultan’s troops, which had in the meanwhile arrived from Maskat. 841. The Government of India approved of Colonel Ross’ proceedings in this matter, and there is no doubt that the prompt demonstration of our policy had a beneficial effect, for news of the collapse of the Hinawi coalition was shortly afterwards received, and Shaikh Saleh, its chief promoter, with his usual fickleness, wrote to the Sultan with offers of co-operation against his enemies. Government of India, to Resident, Persian Golf, No. 1835-E., dated 8tli September 1887. (Extl. A, Nov. 1887, Nos. 25-31.) 842. Assault on Banians at Soor— On 25th July Her Majesty s Ship Ranger arrived at Maskat with two Banians on board. These persons com plained that the Awlad Kassib had carried off one of their community at Soor and severely beaten another, and could assign no reason for the outrage. Sayvid Turki, on the matter being represented to him, at once wrote to the Wali of Soor to enquire into the case and punish the offenders. Shaikhs Abdulla- bin-Salim and Muhammad-bin-Majid of the Beni-bu-Ali had however already of their own accord restored the kidnapped Banian and imprisoned five of the Awlad Kassib. 843. Intertribal disturbances and minor occurrences in 1887 — Minor matters are thus alluded to in the Maskat Administration Reports : — “ In February the S. S. Sultance was sent to Soliar with gunpowder and money, a raid by the Bedouins being reported by the Wali as impending. a Bear-Admiral Sir F. Richards, Commander-in-Chief, Indian Station, visited Maskat in April in Her Majesty's Ship Sphinx on his way up to the Persian Gulf, and called again inMay when returning. His Excellency also visited Maskat in Her Majesty's Ship Bacchante in November on his way from Aden to Bombay. “ In April an attack was made by Zaeed-bin-Khalifa on a section of the Dhowahir tribe at Bereymi for attempting to throw off their allegiance to him. The Sultan to prevent the Beni Yas from being established in power at Bereymi sent the Dhowahir assistance in the shape of money and ammunition, but unfortunately the Dar-as-Sala/n, which carried it, arrived too late at Sohar to thwart Zaeed in his object, aud he succeeded in carrying off two of the Dhowahir Shaikhs as prisoners to Ab^. Dhabbi. “ His Highess Sayyid Turki, who had lately suffered a good deal from one of his old complaints, left on l&amp;fch November for Gvvadur and returned on 2nd December having some what benefited by the change.” 844. Position of affairs on 1st January 1888.— The commencement of the year was marked by trouble at Dhofar, which distant possession had been a constant source of anxiety and expense to the Sultan. On this occasion the Akeed of the fori, on attempting to arrest a murderer, had been attacked by the inhabitants of the town and obliged to retire within the citadel. 845. Sayyid Turki at once despatched a force of 200 men in his steamer the Sultanee, under the command of his sons Sayyids Eeysal and Eahd to the Akeed’s rescue. On arrival, however, it was found that matteis had alreadv settled themselves and assumed a peaceful aspect. Five Shaikhs, ringleaders of the disloyal party, were seized aud brought eventually to Maskat for punish ment. 846. Continued absence of the “ Sultanee ” and despatch of Her Majesty’s Ship Turquoise” in search.— The Sullanee remained absent so long on the expedition mentioned in the previous paragmph that His Highness Sayyid Turki became exceedingly anxious regarding her fate and that°of his two sons who were on board. He accordingly requested the Political Ao-ent to be good enough to arrange that Her Majesty’s Ship Turquoise, which °was then in the harbour, might go in search of her. 847. Captain Brackenbury, in command of the Turquoise, kindly complied with this request. The Sultanee was found lying off Has Madraka without coals and without provisions. After affording the necessary assistance, Sayyids Eeysal and Eahd were taken on board the Turquoise and brought back to Maskat, where great rejoicings were held in honour of their safe return. Savyid Turki also wrote a very cordial letter of thanks for the timely help afforded him. 848. Political Agent —On 26th February Colonel Mockler proceeded to Bagdad on special duty, and Dr. Jayakar assumed charge of the Political Agency and Consulate. 849. Visit of His Highness the Sultan ef Zanzibar.— On the 4th March His Highness Sayyid Bargash-bin-Saeed, Sultan of Zanzibar, arrived at Maskat in his steamer the Nyanza with the intention of visiting the hot springs at Bosher, a town about 16 miles from Maskat, for the sake of his health. His Highness Sayyid Turki accompanied by his sons proceeded on hoard as soon as the Nyanza had anchored. Sayyid Bargash could not be induced to land at Maskat, but a salute of 21 guns was nevertheless fired in his honour by Sayyid Turki. The following day the Nyanza sailed for Gobra a small town a few miles north of Maskat, where Sayyid Bargash disembarked! Sayyid Turki paid his brother a second visit at Bosher, and appears in every way to have treated him with great respect and kindness, in return for which Sayyid Bargash made him a present of B50,000. After spending a week at Bosher, Sayyid Bargash returned to his vessel, when a salute of 101 guns was fired* in his honour, and on 17th March left for Zanzibar. His trip so far from doin&lt;&gt;* him good probably shortened his life, for he only survived his return to Zanzibar a few hours. 850. Removal of Sayyid Saeed-bin-Muhammad from the Dost of Wazeer.— On 5th May Sayyid Turki informed Dr. Jayakar by letter that he had dismissed Sayyid Saeed from the post of Wazeer, saying that Maskat was 194195 too small a town to be in need of one. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, on Resident, Persian Gulf, to the Poiiti- hearing of this, directed Dr. Jayakar to submit a '“Nofirac^bf^’t^'EueCA; f uI1 re P ort 0,1 the subject, and desired to be in- June 1888, Nos. 83-86. formed “ What arrangements have been made or are contemplated, providing for the interchange of verbal confidential communications hitherto so frequently passing through Sayyid Saeed.” 851. Dr. Jayakar reported that His Highness Sayyid Turki attributed his long continued ill-health to sorcery or magic, and suspected his Wazeer of exert ing some evil influence over him. The Wazeer, on the other hand, went in fear of his life, though Sayyid Turki declared he had no intention of harming him. The loss of Nezwa and the ill-feeling existing between the Sultan’s three sons were also attributed by Sayyid Turki to the intrigues of his Wazeer, and the feeling of bitterness and hatred had been growing in the Sultan’s mind for some time past. The report goes on to say that the relations became so strained that Sayyid Saeed was compelled to retire from Maskat. He left for the island of Kishm in a native boat. Sayyid Turki promised to appoint some confiden tial person to replace Sayyid Saeed. The following is the text of a message sent by Dr. Jayakar to the Sultan regarding Sayyid Saeed : — “ Sayyid Saeed informs me that Your Highness has taken a great dislike to him lately, and that he feai’s his life is in danger in consequence. Although I have assured Sayyid Saeed that his fear is groundless, and although I fully believe that Your Highness will not commit any rash act such as is apprehended by Sayyid Saeed, still I think it only right as a friend and a servant of Government to inform Your Highness, that should such an act be committed, Your Hig'hness's conduct will be looked upon with great displeasure both by Colonel Ross and the Government.” 852. Dr. Jayakar also offered to mediate in the matter, hut without success. 853- Bad health of the Sultan. —Sayyid Turki’s condition, tvhich had for some time been feeble, became critical in May, and on 15th of that month the following telegram was sent by Dr. Jayakar to the Resident— “ Sultan is dangerously ill, not expected to recover. If he dies, it is expected that there will be an immediate struggle for power between sons and other complications afterwards. What am I to do in regard to sons until further orders can be received from you.” 854. Colonel Ross replied by telegram :— “In event of fatal termination confine action to arranging safety British subjects and property. You should avoid interference on behalf of any aspirant.” 855. Colonel Ross himself arrived at Maskat shortly afterwards in Her Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Majesty’s Ship Kivgfishev, and had an interview Ma7i 0 8 f 88 India ’ No ' 166, dated 29th with the Sultan. In the course of a report to (Exti. a, June isss, Nos. 445-450.) Government regarding his visit, he remarked— “ His Highness expressed himself chiefly anxious for the safety and welfare of his eldest son Sayyid Muhammad in case of his own death occurring. His Highness said that the two younger sons would in that event combine against the eldest, and he was desirous of providing beforehand for the latter by sending him as Governor to Gwadur, and His Highness requested that Sayyid Muhammad might continue after His Highness's death to hold Gwadur indepen dently, supporting himself from its revenues. He remarked that Sayyid Muhammad would be content with this provision, and that Maskat (meaning Oman) would suffice for the younger sons. I might have told Sayyid Turki at once that the scheme was impracticable and one that I could not recommend the Government of India to entertain, but I perceived that His Highness's mind was very much bent on this project, and I apprehended that an unfavourable reply might affect his health.” 856. After a stay of two days Colonel Ross returned to Bushire, the Sultan’s health being no worse. 857. Death of Sayyid Turki and assumption of power by Sayyid Feysal. —The Sultan did not last long after Colonel Ross’ visit. He died on the 3rd June, his condition having slowly but surely gone from bad to worse. Dr. Jayakar reported as follows :— “ The late Sultan had been suffering from chyluria for many years, and although for a long Political Agent, to Resident, Persian time the disease was in abeyance, the last relapse, which Gulf, No. 177, dated 10th June 1888. proved to be a continuous and serious one, came on about a (Extl. A, July 1888, Nos. 387-403.) year ago. He never recovered from tliis attack, and about, the end of April, owing to the great weakness caused by the disease, he had to take to his bed.”196 858. Sayyid Feysal, the second son, at once assumed power and wrote to Dr. Jayakar, hoping that the friendship which existed between the British Government a?id his father might be maintained in regard to him. 859. Sayyid Turki’s funeral was attended a short distance by Dr. Jayakar and the Agency Office establishment. Her Majesty’s Ship Turquoise also fired a salute from 4-30 p.m. to sunset. The flags of the British and American Consulates and of Her Majesty’s Ship Turquoise were hoisted half-mast for four days. 860. On the Sultan’s death British Indian subjects were ordered to remove their valuables to vessels in harbour, and the marine Battalion Guard was posted in the Agency compound. All, however, passed off quietly and there was no disturbance whatever. Sayyid FeysaTs first act was to write to all the import ant Shaikhs, announcing his assumption of power, and to strengthen the garri sons of the passes leading into Maskat. Most of the Shaikhs replied in a spirit of loyalty, and even the treacherous Shaikh Saleh wrote in friendly terms. 861. Character of Sayyid Turki ,—Colonel Ross in his Annual Admin istration Report for 1888-89 thus describes Sayyid Turki’s character :— “ The death of Sayyid Turki is felt to be a misfortune to Oman; for although his rule was by no means vigorous, he was well skilled in managing Arabs, and usually mild and liberal. His loyalty to the British Government was sincere and unswerving. Whatever his vacillations in other matters, from this policy he never departed, viz.) full trust in and devotion to the British power. This well-known loyalty was recognised by Her Majesty conferring on His Highness in 1886 the Grand Cross of the Star of India, and at the same time the British Gov ernment undertook to afford him active support during his lifetime in case of insurrections and attacks on Maskat. This announcement ensured the maintenance of peace at Maskat so long as Sayyid Turki should continue to reign, and makes his loss the more felt. During his later years Sayyid Turki suffered much from ill-health, and his sufferings, impairing his mind and judgment, rendered him prone to superstition, and the painful suspicious arising therefrom embitteied his last days.” 862. Visit of Eesident in the Persian Gulf. —On hearing of Sayyid Turki’s death, Colonel Ross again visited Maskat and conveyed the condolences of Her Majesty and His Excellency the Viceroy to his family. 863. Zanzibar Subsidy. —In his report of this visit to Government Colo nel Ross said :— “ The question of the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy being of immediate importance, I No. 199, dated 20th June 1888. have submitted it,by telegram. Dr. Jayakar was much of (Kxtl. a, July 1888, Nos. 387-403.) opinion that Sayyid Feysal could not well carry on the.ad ministration of Maskat without this pecuniary aid, and it seems necessary lor British interests that the de facto Government should be strong enough to maintain good order in Maskat and Mattrah; 1 have therefore recommended payment of the monthly instalments to Sayyid Feysal.” 864. Return of Sayyid Saeed, ex-Wazeer, to Maskat.— Sayyid Saeed, who had been living at Bander Abbas, on hearing of Sayyid Turki’s death, at once returned to Maskat. On landing lie was met by Sayyid Fahad, who demanded in Sayyid Feysal’s name his reasons for returning without permission and ordered him to remain a prisoner in his own house till Sayyid Feysal’s pleasure were known His Highness decided that Sayyid Saeed’s presence in Maskat was inimical to the general peace and to the chances of friendly rela tions between himself and his brothers. He was accordingly banished once more from Maskat and retired to Bander Abbass, from which place he shortly afterwards wrote to the Resident, requesting that steps might be taken to pre vent the confiscation of his property in Maskat. 865. Colonel Ross in forwarding copy of Sayyid Saeed’s letter to the Poli tical Agent, said:— &lt;r I think that the writer has claims to our good offices in the way of preventing any confiscation of his property in Oman.” 866 Sayyid Feysal subsequently promised the Political Agent that no harm should befall Sayyid Saeed’s property as far as he was concerned. 867. Position of affairs a month after Sayyid Turki’s death.—Dr. Jayakar reported as follows to the Resident just a month after the death of Sayyid Turki:—197 rf Notwithstanding the general anticipation that the late Sultan’s death would he a signal Political Agent, to Resident, Persian f° r {l lising in favour of one of the aspirants, Savyid Abdul Gulf, No. 198, dated 1st July 18S8. Azeez, it is not a little surprising to note that the course of (Kxtl. A, Aug. 18S8, Nos. 91-105.) political affairs has been even smoother since that sad event than before it.” 86S. He attributed this chiefly to Government’s declared policy of 1885- 86 {vide paragraph 770 et seq.) for the insurrectionists were still uncertain whether Government would maintain this policy or not, 869. Sayyids Abdul Azeez and Ibrahim-bin-Keis write requesting to be informed of the policy of Government towards Sayyid Fey sal.— Sayyids Abdul Azeez and ibrahim-bin-Keis wished to put an end to this un certainty, and wrote asking whether the British Government would support Sayyid Feysal in ihe same manner as his father. Colonel Ross, in a letter to Sayyid Abdul Azeez, wrote in the following guarded terms :— “ The interests of Government are chiefly concerned with the maintenance of tranquillity and prosperity of the people under rulers of their own choice, and it would be in accordance with my instructions to co-operate in any manner in my power to promote these objects.” 870. Political Agent. —Colonel Mockler resumed charge of the Political Agency and Consulate on 6th July. 871. Proposal to levy “Zekat” on produce from interior.— About the middle of July Sayyid Beysal proposed to levy “Zekat” or a tax on pro duce arriving at the coast from the interior. The proposal however was vetoed by the Political Agent as being contrary to treaty stipulations. 872. Capture of Awabee by Sayyid Ibrahim and advance on Eps- tak by Sayyid Feysal-bin-Turki. —The Maskat Administration Reports give the following detailed account of Sayyid Ibrahim’s first act of hostility since the late Sultan’s death and of the retaliatory expedition undertaken by His Highness Sayyid Feysal in person against Rostak, Sayyid Ibrahim’s strong hold, which, as will be seen, turned out a complete fiasco:— u News had been received that Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis was on the point of starting to seize Awabee. Sayyid Feysal wrote to the Ibriyeen to defend Awabee and to the Waliof Nakhl to give any assistance in his power. 873. “The Ibriyeen, however, had been gained over by Ibrahim-bin-Keis and remained aloof from the struggle. Awabee fell on 2nd September alter a stout resistance, iu which the sou of the Akeed, Ali-bin-Seif El Ibree, was killed. 874. “On hearing of this, Sayyid Feysal determined on an expedition against Rostak, the stronghold of Sayyid Ibrahim, and wrote to the tribes to assemble at Burkah. War material was despatched in the Dar-as-Salain under Sayyid Hamad bin Nasir and an escort of Arabs to reinforce the garrison at Burkah. Sayyid Ibrahim had. written by this time to explain his seizure of Awabee. He stated that the inhabitants had asked him to expel the Governor for his oppression towards them, and as he considered Awahee to be one of his own forts, he had acceded. It seems that Awabee had originally been held in his interests by the Ibriyeen, who had afterwards delivered it over to the late Sultan. 875. “On the 18th September, accordingly, His Highness started for Burkah in his steamer the Sulta?iee, accompanied by his brother Sayyid Muhammad, Shaikh Tahuoon-bin- Za’eed-bin-Khalifah of Abu-Dhabbi and all the principal Al-bu-Sa’eedees of Maskat, except Sayyids Hilal aud Muhammad-bin-Azan. 876. “The expedition, however, proved a failure. Almost from the first there was defec tion in Sayyid Feysal’s army, the Chiefs with him preferring to try and arrange a peace between him and Sayyid Ibrahim to fighting. Want of money to pay the troops further operated to this end. It appears that on landing at Burkah, His Highness proceeded to Waseyl near Rostak, where the people of the surrounding country tendered their submission to him. A fight took place between the two forces, which resulted in Sayyid Feysal establishing himself in the Mizarse bastion, after which he proceeded to shell the fort of Rostak. The \ai Sad tribe had in the meantime risen and were attacking Sayyid Feysal’s line of communications with the sea. This led to a request that Her Majesty’s Ship Turquoise might be sent to the Batineh Coast to make a counter-demonstration, which, however, was not acceded to. 877. “ The Sultan’s army now became completely disaffected, refusing to fight any longer, and Sayyid Feysal was compelled to make peace. His Highness returned to Maskat on 17th October, after a fruitless absence of a month, and Awabee remained in the hands of Sayyid Ibrahim, to whom also hopes appear to have been held out for the renewal of the subsidyenjoyed by him during Sayyid Turin’s lifetime. In December the Yal Sad, who rose against Sayyid Feysal during the Kostak expedition, sent messengers to Maskat to ask pardon for their action. His Highness accepted the apology and pardoned the tribe.” 878. Character of His Highness Sayyid Feysal.—The following was Colonel Mockler’s opinion of Sayyid Fey sal’s character at this early period of his rule :—/ “ I^gret to say that little reliance can be placed on anything Sayyid Feysal says. He is at^pt^sent entirely in the hands of his writers and one or two Banians connected with the litical Agent, to Resident, Persian customs, who play upon his vanity and youth. He rarely , No - 500-A. 1, dated 4th Nov- moves outside the palace precincts himself, and his staff ‘’ u , 1S88 ’ of writers and other intimates care for nothing except what (hxtl. A, Jan. 1889, Nos. 31-32.) they can get out of him.” 879. Inter-tribal disturbances and minor events in 1888.— Minor events are noted as follows in the Administration Reports of the Maskat Agency : - “ In April an affray took place between the Hikman and Yal Bede tribes near Barkah. regarding an old boundary dispute, in which six lives were lost. Peace was speedily restored between the two tribes by a deputation sent from Maskat by His Highness the Sultan. “ A demonstration was also made by Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir at the head of 500 men against Manh, but the fort being well guarded, the expedition failed, and Shaikh Hilal returned to Nezwa without having attained any political object. “ Reports from Sohar stated that the Shahook and Nakbieen tribes, whilst on their way to attack the forts of Dibba and Kore, Fakhan, were opposed by the Sharkieen and Sultan-bin- Muhammad; the encounter resulting in the death of 13 men of the Sharkieen. “ In July four Banians arrived from Barkah with a complaint that they had been assaulted by a party of the Beni Jabir whilst drawing water at Barkah. The case was represented to His Highness, and an enquiry resulted iu the imprisonment at Maskat of the ringleaders of the offending party. ‘ f Fighting again occurred at Barkah between the Yal Bede and Hikman tribes in which 6 men on each side were killed. A tight also took place in the Wades Ghafir and Sahtan between the Ghafiri tribes, Meyayihah and Ibriyeen, in which some 50 men were killed and an equal number taken prisoners. Peace was restored by the mediation of Sayyid Ibrahim-bin- Keis of Rostak. Repoits were received in Maskat during the month (December) of a contemplated rising of the Nejdean tribes against Oman. The expedition was to be conducted by Ibn Rasheed in conjunction with Sheikh Jasira-bin-Thani of El Bidaa and to be on a larger scale than any thing hitherto attempted. Nothing however occurred to disturb the general tranquillity of the province.” J Buseire, The 15th December 1889. (Sd.) W.

The death of His Highness Sayyid Turki had fortunately not been followed by disturbances of any kind. Sultan Sayyid Feysal, the second son of His Highness Sayyid Turki, bad maintained firm bold over Maskat, and the Political Agent reported that there were no rumours afloat of any contemplated movements. Exti. b, Feb. 1889 , 881- Settlement of the question of the alienation of real property Nos. 26 - 33 . * n Khojah Fort at Mattrah.— A question had arisen at the end of the previous year regarding the sale of a small plot of land by His Highness the Sultan in the Khojah Fort at Mattrah. The case was looked upon as an important one because it involved a principle in which the whole Khojah community were directly interested. As regards the claim of the Khojahs to the plot in question the Political Agent wrote as follows :— Extl. B, Feb. 1899, Nos. 26-33, vide tNo. 27. ' ' “ From an enquiry I have made with the oldest residents of the Khojah Fort, it appears to me that a wall was built round the Khojah quarter so as to give it the necessary defensive protection and appearance of a fort in the reign of the Imam Sayyid Ahmad-bin-Saud, the founder of the Al-bu-Saudee-dynasty, who ruled between 1744 and 1783 A.L&gt;. with the consent and permission of that ruler; that before that period it contained in addition to Khojah houses several others belonging to members of other Indian communities, which were evidently purchased at the time of the erection of the wall from their owners by the Khojah Jamah or individual members, so as to make it exclusively a Khojah fort, or quarter; that the conditions requiring the necessity of a protective or defensive wall, namely, the danger of an attack from the interior in the absence of a wall to the town of Mattrah itself and the piratical tendency of the Jowasim having passed away, the fort wall has been gradually, since the days of Sayyid Saud-bin-Sultan, built upon, so that it has now entirely lost its fortified appearance although the quarter still remains exclusively a Khojah one; and that since its conversion into a purely Khojah quarter no ruler of Maskat has alleged a claim to any vacant piece of ground within the enclosure or disputed the right of ownership of the Khojah Jamah to any such J piece.” “ His Highness Sayyid Feysal based his claim to the piece of ground on the fact that his father, the late Sayyid Turki, had attempted to sell it about a year before his death. It appears, however, that the late Sultan relinquished his idea of selling it, on its being represented that he had no right to the land in question.” 882. His Highness Sayyid Feysal after some correspondence wrote to the Political Agent as follows :— “ We have to inform you that we have given up all contention in the matter of the piece of ground in the Khojah Fort out of respect and regard for the British Government.” 883. Navigation of the Sur creek—Sayyid Badr-bin-Saif reported that the Beni-bu-Ali of Aikeh had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Highness’s officers and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in all local matters.

Rumoured movement of Sayyid Abdul Aziz against the Ger mans in East Africa and suggested reconciliation with the Sultan of Maskat. —On the 7th January the Political Resi- nv 3, dated Businre, 7th Janu- ^ en j. submitted to the Government of India copies of correspondence that had passed between Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali and Jumah-bin-Saeed on the one hand and the Sultan, Sayyid Feysal, on the other. The Shaikhs in their letters put forward two propositions : Firstly, that the Sultan should despatch his uncle, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, to the East Coast of Africa against the Germans. Secondly, that the Sultan should make a peaceful settlement with his uncle. The Shaikhs suggested that “ the officers of the British Government ” might be consulted in the matter. (Cf. also paras. 888-891.) Extl. A, Feb. 1889, Nos. 81.-97, vide No. 94. 885. Refusal of His Highness to move against German East Africa- —The Sultan gave explicit replies on both points. As regards the expedition to East Africa, he wrote:— “ We do rot see any way to entertain that proposal at all.”w*« E Ko, A 8 i V 07 b J®« 89 ' 886. Conditions of reconciliation with Sayyid Abdul Aziz pro- His Highness the Sultan-— With reference to the proposed recon- [is Highness wrote :— “ As to the proposals regarding making peace between ourselves and our uncle Abdul Aziz what you advise we accept and do not dislike it, but we are of opinion that the peace between us will not remain permanent and continuous while he lives in Oman * * . . * *• *. But if he accepts the condition of removing from Oman to India under the supervision of the Oreat Government, he will get a subsidy from us, on this condition only through the medium of the (English) Government, and without that condition he will never get it from us. ’ The attempt at reconciliation ended in failure.

Secret E., May 1889, Nos. 544-547, vide No. 546. 889. Colonel Euan Smith in his letter to Lord Salisbury, dated Zanzibar, 26th January, wrote as follows :— “ At His Highness’s request I made enquiries regarding this from the Government of India and received a reply that the report was not true. The Sultan has also summoned thirty-one of the principal IVIaskari Arabs and they have denied any knowledge of the matter. To-day, however, the Prime Minister of the Sultan of Maskat, who has been here for some months on a mission from his master, called upon me to take leave before his return to Maskat. He in formed me that the report was certainly true, that the matter had been talked of before he left Maskat some months ago, and that the Maskari Arabs had sent some sort of invitation to Sayyid Abdul Aziz who had promised to remit the whole of the clove tax should he be successful.^ Exti. a, July 1889, Iq his report to the Government of India on the subject the Political Nos. 17M79, otde No. 176 .

And so far as I have been able to ascertain Sayyid Abdul Aziz has 1889^° ll0 ’ 16til May other views and never harboured the project himself though possibly it may have been suggested to him. It is a priori improbable that a man of Sayyid Abdul Aziz's experience would risk almost certain capture and imprisonment on such a veuture. ' Sayyid Feysal, the de facto Sultan of Maskat, has not hitherto appointed any Wazir or Minister, and I would suggest a reference to Her Majesty's Agent at Zanzibar to ascertain who the person alluded to is.' 891.

Visit of the Persian Governor of Kishm to Maskat—On 17th June Shaikh Hassan-hin-Abdullah, the Persian Governor of Kishm, visited Maskat with the object of establishing an agency there for the reception of all salt, etc., exported from his district. He wanted to compel all persons trading thence to convey their salt to a particular batian of Maskat, the latter of course paying for the privilege of being sole consignee. . He failed however in his negotiations. Exti. a, Aug. 1889 , 896.

Designs of Sayyid Abdul fAziz against Maskat.— On 17 th July a messenger from Sayyid Abdul Aziz arrived at Maskat with letters for the Resident and the Political Agent. In these he stated that he was about to march against Maskat, and that he had been joined by Peysal-bin-Mahmud and Ibrahim-bin-Kais, and asked for the support of the Government. He in formed the Political Agent he would duly warn him when ready for the attack. The Resident did not reply to his letter. Extl. A, Sept. 1889, Ijos. 141-146, vide / r^o. 143. J 898.

The close of July, however, saw some development of Sayyid Abdul Aziz's plots. Following closely in his letters to the Resident and the Political Agent he commenced his advance on the. capital. 900. The Political Agent' wrote the following report “ Sayyid Abdul Aziz left Semail with his force on or about the 29th ultimo (July), with the intention of advancing against Maskat. On the 30th July the Kahza Pass was attacked by ▲ the euemy ; but the defenders, 600 in number, heat them off. No regular attempt seems to have ^ been made via the Ak Pass. After his reverse at the Kahza, Sayyid Abdul Aziz fell back on Samad *****. It is stated that his force is broken up * * * * . There was some excitement at the near approach of Sayyid Abdul Aziz at Mattrah, hut no feeling of alarm was expressed in Maskat/” 901. His Highness sent an intimation of his victory to the Political Resident. In replying Colonel Ross wrote : ‘'The success will, I have no doubt, strengthen Your Highness’s Government, and, I hope, tend to a permanent state of tranquillity in Oman.” ( Cf* also paras. 892 and 909-913.)

Uaskat vessels at Calcutta.—On 3rd September a letter was forwarded from 201fek His Highness Sayyid Feysal saying that the masters of Maskat vessels, which proceeded every year to Calcutta, had been laying complaints before him that their Khallassis were used to desert them at Calcutta and that these desertions caused great difficulties. No. 194, dated Eushire, 18th September 1889. 903. The Political Agent was instructed to inform His Highness that masters of Maskat vessels should, on des ertions occurring, apply to the Magistrates of Calcutta and in such cases as the laws of British India provide for, they would get redress. Exti. a, Feb. 1890, 904.

In September information was received that seven fresh African slaves had been imported to Lingah from Soor * * * The Maskat Agency Report says— “ There were no seizures of slave dhows during tbe year. The number of fugitive slaves that sought freedom at the Consulate during the year was 51, of whom 35 have been liberated under treaty stipulations of 1873 and 16 were dismissed.” 907. Intertribal disturbances and minor occurrences in 1889— Tribal differences are thus noted in the Administration Report and Political Diaries :— Ibth March .—A letter has been received from Rashid bin Aziz giving the news that Sulaiman bin Saifar Riyamee having attacked the Awamir at Hadeirah had to retreat with a loss of 6 killed and 18 wounded. The loss on the part of the Awamir is reported to be only 4 killed and 6 wounded. ^ 18th May .—News was received of a fight at Soor between the Beni bu Ali and the Jenibeh. Cause of quarrel unknown. Three of the Beni bu Ali reported killed and 6 wounded. 12th September .—News has been received of a raid having been committed on the Al Saad tribe probably by the Beni Gfhafir who are reported to have carried away 30 camels and wounded one of the men of the former tribe. u 24th December .—* * * . The Political Agent reported an affray having taken place in the Dahireh between the Beni Kalban and the Naim on the one side and the Beni Ali on the other, in consequence of the latter having some time back waylaid a party of the Beni Kalban and killed 8 of them. Although no reliable information could be obtained as regards the actual severity of the fight, or the numbers of the killed and wounded, the result of the fight seems to have been decidedly against the Beni Ali.” 908. Position of affairs on 1st January 1890.— The year 1889 had been marked by another attempt against Maskat on the part of Sayyid Abdul Aziz. And though this had been unsuccessful his restless attitude continued to disturb the public mind. And rumours were rife of further disturbances in the near future. ExtL A, Feb. 1890, 909. Hostile designs of Sayyid Abdul Aziz. —The movements of Sayyid 170182 .

Next day came a story that Hamud bin Said was besieging Mattrah. The Sultan made and personally superintended the arrangements for the defence of Maskat. The leading native merchants of the place requested the Political Agent to take measures for their protection. The Hindus at Mattrah were warned that they should repair to Maskat, and the Khojahs ivho preferred to remain in their fort were furnished with British flags. 910. The story that Mattrah was besieged proved untrue, but this only partially allayed the alarm. The shops remained closed and the Hindus removed their property to Maskat. The roads were closed and all trade was at a standstill. On 20th January, the Sultan received information that Sayyid Abdul Aziz had got through the Wadi Sakhan in the Beni Ruaheh country, and had arrived at Fanjah, and that next day he had been joined by Shaikh Hamud-bin-Said and the sons of the late Imam Azan, and that the day follow ing they had arrived at Sib. 911. On the 26th His Highness Sayyid Feysal and Sayyid Fahad sailed for Sib on board the Sultanee with the idea of advancing on it by land and sea, Sayyid Fahad being dropped en route at Al Wateyah. But Sayyid Abdul Aziz did not await their arrival and the Sultan returned to Maskat. On the 31st Sayyid Fahad reported his arrival at Falaj and that Sayyid Abdul Aziz had moved further west. 912. Early next month Sayyid Fahad sent word that all was quiet on the Batinah Coast and that Abdul Aziz and Shaikh Hamud were at Rostak. News was brought the same day that Sayyid Abdul Aziz was sick with fever. 913. By March Sayyid Abdul Aziz had apparently abandoned all designs against the Sultan. For on the 7th of that month His Highness received a report that he intended going to Abu Dthabi, and on the 31st Sayyid Abdul .Aziz w r rote to Shaikh Saleh bin Ali to say he was about to pay a visit to Zaid bin Khalifah of that place. A week later the Minister called on the Political A gent to say that all was now quiet in Oman. (Cf. also paras. 892 and 956-960.) Extl. A, A up. 1890, Nos. 84-*8, vide No. 85. Extl.

British protection to Portuguese subjects in Maskat and the entertainment of aliens in Government Offices —The Political Agent reported on the 23rd February that two Portuguese subjects were regis tered in the Consulate as protected subjects on the same footing as subjects of the Native States as detailed in Aitchison’s Treaties, Volume VII, pages 83-81. And he asked for information whether there were any agreements with the Portuguese Government to the effect and by what rule the subjects of the latter power were given the advantages of British protection in foreign ports. He further requested information regarding the entertainment of Goanese subjects in Government offices. 915. The Political Resident replied :— “ I know of no regulations under which Natives of Goa are entitled to registration as subjects of a protected State. I think the protection extended to them in foreign territory is from usage and from the fact that they are Christians and subjects of a power which has no consular or other representatives in these parts, and in absence of special arrangements they naturally look to us for protection, and their claim to this and our right to extend pro tection when considered desirable has never that I know been questioned/* Exti a Aue 1890 . 916.

But I am to observe that such Goanese as are subjects of Portugal do not come within the scope of the agreement with the Sultan of Maskat in regard to jurisdiction over the subjects of Native Indian States, and that if in the absence of any representatives of Portu guese authority protection is claimed by subjects of that power it can only be extended as a matter of comity and cannot be insisted on as a matter of right if called in question by a competent authority.

Terrible storm at Maskat.— The Political Agent in his report in June on the subject gave the following details:— “A severe cyclone accompanied with heavy and continuous rain, occurred here and No. 161, dated Maskat, 16th June all along the coast from Soor to Suwaik on the 4th and 5th 1820. instant. It commenced first about midnight of the 4th, but early in the morning of the 5th there was a lull in the wind which was principally from the north-east, although the rain poured dowu in torrents. At about 10-30 a.m. on the 5th tbe breeze freshened up again and a very disastrous storm, which lasted till about midnight, swept over the place. The quantity of rain which was registered at the Civil Hospital from the commencement of the storm to the end, a period of about 24 hours, was 11 inches and 24 cents. Mattrah being open to the north-east wind the fury of the storm was principally expended there, and several buglows, badaus and zaeemas were washed ashore and wrecked/’ * * 921. The disastrous effects of the storm were unfortunately not confined only to these two towns, but extended riy;ht into the interior as far as the Semaeel valley on the one side and the Wadi Beni Gafir on the other * * * */’ 922. u The Sultan * * * computes the number of deaths due directly to the effects of this storm to be about 727, but I am inclined to be of opinion that it is under the mark, as there are several places from which no report has yet been received/’ 923. “ The damage done to the property which in Oman consists principally of date trees, is considered enormous, as several thousands of trees are reported to have been uprooted and carried away by the flo &gt;ds * * *.

Besides Maskat and Mattrah, the whole of the Batineli had been affected. The statement shows that 109,500 date-trees were destroyed involving a loss of $1,525,000. 926. After pointing out that date-trees constitute the principal wealth of the country the Political Agent continued :— “The total loss, however, shown in the statement barely represents the actual loss to the country, to estimate which the price of the average products of these tre-s, namely, $871,875 for tbe next 15 years, the time that will probably be required to substitute new trees in the place of those that have been already lost, h is to be added to it. The loss of shipping which 201 /v- 1 .

The letter concluded : — “ I have succeeded in tracing in an old manuscript an account of only one similar storm which occurred here on the night of the 4th of Jemadee-al- (A. D. 865, 2nd May.)

The country round Simayil, Keika, Bidbid, on to Sohar was completely flooded and the last town itself was nearly destroyed by the inundation of the AVadi Sailan.” 928 Invitation of His Highness the Sultan to the Family of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to live at Maskat—On the 27th June the Political Agent wrote as follows: — E\tl.

Outline of events determining the recognition of His High ness Sayyid Fey sal. —The assumption of power by His Highness Sayyid Exti. a, Sept, isse, Feysal, the second son of the late Sultan, had been unmarked by any of the dis turbances which it was anticipated might arise from the aspirations of rival claimants to the Sultanate. This extraordinary tranquillity was attributed by the Political Agent to the declared policy of the Government of India to the late Sultan and the ignorance of possible pretenders to the throne as to how far this policy would be continued with regard to the present Ruler. Shortly after the death of Sayyid Turki, Sayyids Abdul Aziz and Ibrahim-bin-Keis wrote to the Resident to enquire whether Savvid Feysal would enjoy the same support from the British Government as Snyyid Turki had done. And Colonel Ross replied that it would be in accordance with his instructions to co-operate in any manner in his power for the mainten ance of tranquillity and the prosperity of the people. 940. The only serious movement against Sultan Sayyid Feysal made during 1888 was Sayyid Ibrahim’s seizure of Awabee. But Sayyid Fey sal’s position at Maskat was not seriously shaken by the loss, and in December one of the tribes, the Yal Saad, that had risen against him, came in and asked for pardon for their share in the transaction. Exti. a, Feb. 1889 , 941. On the 25th December 18^8 the Resident received a telegram from t)irf^Noa 5 58 6 &amp; 59 Calcutta enquiring whether he considered the chance of a dynastic struggle had ended. To this Colonel Ross replied that it did not appear to him that Sayyid Fey sal’s position had been affected by the Rostak affairs, and he was of opinion that the chances of a dynastic struggle were too indefinite to make further delay expedient. Exti. A, July 1889, Nos. 1-7, vide No. 2. 942. On the 15th April 1889 Colonel Ross received the following mes sage :— Confidential telegram 'from Foreign to Resident, dated Simla, 15th April 1889 . “ Secretary of State agrees to formal recognition of Sayyid Feysal. Do you still think this desirable, and, if so, uould you attac h any warning or conditions ? 943. The Resident replied that the recognition was desirable but without condition s^ and that, if authorised, he would proceed to Maskat, wherei should the situatiou be still unchanged, he would convey the Viceroy’s message with the usual ceremonies. Exti. a, July 1889, 944 This proposal was sanctioned, but on proceeding to Maskat Colonel ^°N08.'3.6. Confidential telegram from Foreign, l l °ss found that circumstances had arisen which dated Simla, 2 oih April 1889 . rendered it expedient to defer the formal recogni- Letter No. 103 , from Resident, to tion of His Highness Sayyid Feysal as Sultan. Foreign, dated 30 th May i8»9. jj e a pp re hended a serious rising of Hinawi tribes of the Sharkiyeh and a coalition of Sayyid Abdul Aziz and Sayyid Ibrahim-bin- Rais against the Sultan. The Hinawi tribes had been raising money by special taxes, and there seemed good reason to fear a serious attack might be made after the fast of Ramadhan upon His Highness Sayyid Feysal.y- Nos. 128-142, vide February 1890 No. 129. The Kesident wrote :— , Extl. A, July 1889, In view of this by no means improbable occurrence, it did not appear to me opportune Nos. 1-7, vide No. 6. to convey to Sayyid Feysal the formal recognition of the Government of India.” 945. The matter was therefore postponed, and shortly after the despatch of his letter, Colonel Ross’ prediction of a rising against Sultan Sayyid Feysal was verified. In July of the same year, 1889, Sayyid Abdul Aziz commenced a movement against Maskat. He was, however, repulsed at the Kahza Pass and compelled to retire discomfited. Another attempt was made in January of Exti. a, July 1890 , No. 69, dated Maskat, 23rd the present year (1890), but, like the previous February 1890. one ^ en( j ec [ j n failure. However, Sayyid Abdul Aziz Was still able to be troublesome, and the Political Agent in his letter of the 23rd February pointed out why difficulties might be anticipated :— • f&lt; The relations between the opposite factions comprised in the various Hinawi and Ghafiri tribes throughout the country are so strained at present that serious disturbances may breakout at any moment. This will give Sayyid Abdul Aziz a fresh chance, and, I presume, successive risings may be looked forward to as a matter of course as long as he remains alive.” • 946. Major Yate reviewed the claims of the various descendants of the first Imam, Ahmad-bin-Said, left alive in Oman. And the question of succession appeared to be narrowed down not only to the descendants of Sayyid Said, but to two individuals, Sayyid Abdul Aziz and Sayyid Feysal, the defacto Sultan. The former seemed to the Political Agent to be too much ‘of an autocrat to be a general favourite. “ Though almost without doubt the best fitted by education &amp;nd ability to succeed his late brother, he seems to have failed so far to gain the attachment of the people by his own personal qualities, and he has not the money.to purchase their adherence.” Major Yate gave his impression of the prevailing popular opinion upon the question of the choice of a Ruler :~ “ The main aim and object of the Chiefs and people is to m aintain a division of power so ns to prevent any one man becoming strong enough to tax them all with impunity, and yet at the same time to retain in their hands a lever sulliciently powerful to force out money for them selves when opportunity offers.” 947. Taking the whole of the circumstances into consideration, he arrived at the following determination :— u I think we mav reasonably conclude that the majority have no wish to disturb the present regime, and therefore that in recognising Sayyid Feysal we shall be giving effect to the wishes of the chiefs and people of the country.” 948. Another reason adduced for the advisability of recognising Sayyid Feysal was the large vested interests of British subjects, Hindoo and Khojah, in the coast towns, where they had property at stake to the value of many lakhs of rupees. “ Sayyid Feysal has now been in power for the last year and nine months * * * “ * an( j so f ar as I arn aware he has throughout done his best to meet the wishes of the British Government and he appears to promise to be able and willing to fulfil all the conditions we require * * *•’ 949. Colonel Ross concurred in the opinion that the time had arrived for the Resident’.

In reply to Colonel lloss’ felicitations and good wishes His Highness replied:— 1 “ I request you to convey to His Excellency the Viceroy the expression of my respectful acknowledgments for the gratifying message you have conveyed and to intimate my inten tion to maintain to the full the same relations as existed with the British Crovernment in the time of my father and to act up to all the engagements undertaken by my father and prede cessor in the Government of Maskat.

On the 31st June Sayyid Abdul Aziz wrote to Colonel Boss stating that he had arrived in Bombay, that an officer of Government had met him, and thai he intended proceeding to Poona to wait upon the Governor. At an interview with H. E. the Governor at Poona, Sayyid Abdul Aziz requested leave to proceed to Simla and that he might have an audience with H. E. the Viceroy. This was found to be impracticable as His Excellency was just leaving Simla on a tour through the Native States. 958. In his letter of 15th September 1890 to the address of H. E. the Viceroy, Sayyid Abdul Aziz wrote— “ The representation I wish to make to Your Excellency is very simple and short.

The suit for compensation filed in the case by the Nakhuda of the Jeneibee, the Arab Aweissee stink by the Simla, was heard by the Acting Poli tical Agent. He found that the collision was entirely due to the carelessness of the Nakhuda in not carrying a light on a dark night and also in allowing passengers to take charge of .the helm, while he was himself asleep. 972. The case was dismissed. But Surgeon-Major Jayakar represented the now destitute condition of the passengers of the Jeneibee, their Nakhuda, and crew to the compassionate consideration of the British India Steam N avi gation Company, and recommended that Rs. 1,000 be granted by the Company to the sufferers. 973. The Agents at Maskat replied that “ the Company reject on principle Surgeon-Major Jayakar’s suggestion for compensation* to the sufferers by the negligence of the Nakhuda.” 974- Slave Trade- —The Administration Reports of the Persian Gulf Political Residency and Maskat Political Agency contain the following entries on the subject: — “ The traffic in raw slaves mentioned in last year’s report continue in unabated vigour and numerous importations into the Persian and Arabian ports are believed to have taken place. &lt;( A circular letter was addressed to the Trucial Chiefs reminding them of their engage ment in this respect; as usual, the Beni Jabar and other Bedouin tribes on the Batineh Coast were the principal offenders. “ In May Her Majesty’s Ship Cossack brought for adjudication the case of a dhow captured by her near Ras-Gameilah and destroyed after her crew had fired on the ship’s boats; the dhow was condemned. “ In September, twenty-five African slaves arrived at Maskat in the British India Steamer Kistnu from Karachi in charge of some Arabs. They were, after enquiry by the Acting Political Agent, liberated with the assent of the Sultan and sent to Bombay ; their release, however, called forth strong remonstrance from Shaikh Salcli-biu-A!i to His Highness Sayyid Fey sal. “During this month the Resident at Bushire made a representation to the Political Agent regarding the wholesale importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf from Soor and the British Coast. “ During the year thirty-two fugitive slaves taking refuge at this Consulate were Creed under the Treaty of 1878.” 975. The following entries in the Maskat Political Diary are illustrative of the difficulties which have to be encountered in dealing with the question of the slave trade :— “28th October .—I paid an official visit to His Highness’the Sultan and took the oppor tunity of communicating to him the purport of the reports from the Residency Agents at Liugah and Shargah regarding the wholesale importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf Ports from Soor and the Batineh. “ 2nd December .—His Highness Seyyid Feysal, accompanied by his brothers Seyyid Muhammad and Seyyid Fehd, visited the Political Agent. Among other subjects touched on,. His Highness enquired whether it were true that the’ Germans had proclaimed that slaves might be bought and sold in their territory on the East African coast, remarking that if it were true, their doing so would draw to them the hearts of all the Arabs.” 976- Intertribal disturbances and minor events in 1890.— Minor events are noted as follows in the Administration Report and the Political Diaries of the Maskat Agency:— “ 12th January .—It is reported that.Hamud has raided 400 sheep, the property of Salim- bin-Hasan, Rahbiyeh, from near Kahza.” “ 7th February .—News received that a kafilah of 40 camels, in charge of some of the Al Wahibah, el Habus, and el Duhaha on its way to Akk Pass had been attacked in the Wadi Semail by the Rahabieen in retaliation for the loss of the 400 sheep carried off by Shaikh Hamud-al-Jahafi.

His Highness is despatching Sayyid Nasir-bin-Muhammad to Semail to endeavour to recover the plundered property.' 977- Position of Affairs on 1st January 1891. —The withdrawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to India removed the chief disturbing factor in Oman politics. It had freed Maskat from the former interminable rumours of attack, and exercised a beneficent effect upon trade by strengthening the feeling of security to life and property. But the close of 1890 had brought fresh troubles. A caravan of the Sharkiyeh had been plundered by tribes of the Semail valley. And inattention to the consequent quarrels at their outset gave rise to con siderable complications before the matter was. ultimately settled. 978. The state of the Sharkiyeh and the stagnation of trade in Mattrah and Maskat. —His Highness the Sultan had unfortunately not exerted himself to effect a settlement in the case of the.plunder of Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali’s kafilah in the Semail valley by the Yaarabeh, and Beni Jabir. (Cy. last entry in para. 976.) In December 1890 and January 1891 the disturbances caused by the contending parties reacted seriously on the mer cantile communities of Oman. In a memorandum on the subject, dated 22nd February, the Political Agent reviews the situation :— “The unsettled condition of the country and the consequent insecurity of the roads has had a corresponding effect on the trade of Maskat and Mattrah, for whilst, on the one hand, all trade communications with the interior have for the present closed, on the other hand, the difficulties in recovering outstandings and dues have in a proportionate ratio considerably in creased, * * * the trade with the Sharkiyeh has entirely ceased. The same thing has now * * * occurred to the trade with the Semail valley, while the trade with the Batineh, always fitful at this time of the year, has now become more so owing to the disturbed condition of the country.' It was pointed out that the British traders were the principal losers, and that if the situation did not improve, many would have to close business. The memorandum continues: — “ His Highness the Sultan, whose friendly influence at the time might have prevented the intertribal rupture, has from the beginning taken little or no interest in such matters and has quietly allowed the authority of dictating terms of peace which rightly belonged to him to pass away from his hands ^ * * . In acting as he has done, he has not only shewn his incapacity to grapple with the question of intertribal quarrels, but also a great disregard for the interests of trade which depends mainly on the welfare of the country.' J Exti a Jui 1891 979 . As late as the 19th April things had improved but little. The x nob.’ 298 - 328 , ’ Political Agent received on that date a long confidential letter from Messrs. vide No. 315, 211J ToTvelle &amp; Co., of Maskat, complaining of the commercial deadlock and request ing that the matter might be duly represented to the Government of India. 980. The Resident in forwarding the correspondence pointed out_ that although political causes had no doubt contributed largely to the decline in the prosperity of Maskat, yet the merchants se6med to owe some of their existing difficulties to miscalculation of the situation by ordering gooc s as usual when there was little or no sale for them. He added Extl.

The Political Agent wrote :— « The only object such boats can have in carrying the French flag and papers must be to cover unlawful traffic, viz., slaves.” Secret fc., June 1891, On the 14th March the Political Agent forwarded a nominal roll, furnished N-i85-20i ; Hig Highness Sayyid Feysal, of thirteen masters (Nakhudah) of Sur boats 212Secret E., June 1891, Nos. 185-201, vide No. 194.

On 5th April the Political Agent again wrote:— .“I have just been informed that during' the past year most of tbe Sur boats have obtained French flags not as formerly from Madagascar but from the French authorities at Obokh * . * ,and that the Nakhudahs were told to go there by the French Consul at Aden.' 989.

Seyyid Feysal proposed to address to the President of the French Republic regarding the granting of flags by the representatives of that nation to His Highness’s subjects, and also the copy of a letter from His Highness, soliciting the advice of the Government of India as to what action he could safely take to uphold his jurisdiction in his own waters over such of his sub jects as had obtained French flags. The Political Agent wrote :— “ His Highness remarked that if they and their boats enn be covered by tbe French flag in his territorial waters, tbe French flag may some day be held to cover their bouses and pro perty on land.' In a letter of the same date the Political Agent reported that eight of the principal Shaikhs of the Jenebah of Sur had stated to him that they had got their French papers from the French Consul at Aden and not from Obokh, and that they had paid a fee of R40 for each paper.

The matter will be reported to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the information of Her Majesty’s Government who have already been addressed. In the meantime it seems undesirable that the Sultan should send a protest direct to the French Government, but Colonel Mockler should not prohibit him from doing so. Our action in the matter should be confined to advice.’’ 992. His Highness tbe Sultan accepted the advice given him, not to address the French Government on the subject. Secret e., Dec. i89i, 993. On the 2nd November the Political Resident reported that two Sur boats under French colours, and said to have on board 25 to 30 slaves each, had passed Bushire. 'While recent information was to the effect that as many as 50 such boats with slaves on board were bound for the same port. Eighteen dhows of Sur under French colours had put in to Lingah and several native boats flying the same flag deposited. their papers with the French Consular ^ Agent at Basrah. But nothing had been ascertained either by the British . Consul at Basrah or the Vice-Consul at Muhammarah regarding the alleged traffic in slaves. This letter concluded the correspondence on the subject for 1891. ( Cf. a\so para. 1028.) ^994.

The fire, I believe, (was) certainly the handiwork of the HoWamid section of the Howasinah in enmity to the head Shaikh of the Howasinah (Muhammad bin Nasir) who belongs to another section (Sowalim), and that they were incited to do the deed by Sayyid Hamad bin Nasir, Mali of Sohar, within whose jurisdiction Khaburah until lately has been ; also that the Shaikh of the HoWamid personally told His Highness Sayyid Feysal that they would burn the Bazaar of Khaburah unless he adjudged to them half the rent of the shops which had hitherto been received by Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir, that Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir on hearing this doubled the guard of the bazaar, but was told by His Highness Sayyid Feysal that there was no fear as he would arrange matters between the Howasinah sections. “ At present I am inclined to believe that His Highness Sayyid Feysal is not only dis- tinctly responsible for the loss of property belonging to the British merchants of Khaburah but did greatly himself contribute to bring about the burning of the bazaar.'215 Evti. a, July 1891 , In a letter from Kahtan bin Yaarab, Wali of Khaburah, to His Highness Si n!) 8 308 .’ Sayyid Eeysal, dated 26th February, the following passage occurs :— “It was found by the Howasinah and the merchants and the peop 1 ^ of the town and by me also that it had been committed by the How amid, and the merchants have determined to go to lour Highness * # “ Some of their goods also which were not burnt were stolen by the people of the town * * 1002. In another letter of the same date, the Wali of Khaburah wrote to His Highness, stating that on his return to the town he set to work to collect the goods plundered from the British subjects, and that finally every thing they could gather together had been put into a house. The letter continued : — Kxtl.

A representative of the Local Government was present at the Panchayat. The award of this Panchayat, which placed the losses of the sufferers by the fire at $12,739, was communicated to His Highness the Sultan. 1004. His Highness acknowledged the communication saying— “ Although we have grounds for discussing the matter, we give it up in agreeing with the wishes of the Great Government who have in view nothing but what is good. ” In view of the low state of the Exchequer, His Highness urged that the utmost he could afford towards discharging the amount was the payment of $1,000 per mensem out of the Zanzibar subsidy commencing from the year 1892. 1005. The Resident recommended the adoption of the plan proposed by His Highness for the payment of the compensation agreed upon.

The Habus having stolen property belonging to the Rahabiin and the latter being unable to obtain compensation, the Gafri had united against the Hinawi tribes with a view to closing the trade routes from Sharkiyeh. The result was naturally injurious to the trade of Maskat. The Sultan promptly despatched an official to negotiate between the contending tribes but with no apparent result. Exti. a, April 1893, 1025. The situation remained unaltered until the close of the year. On t-^No 1 32 ^4th December the Political Agent wrote:— “ The Sultan has taken no steps as yet towards carrying out his intention of visiting the Semail in person ) meanwhile the Wali whom he deputed to arrange matters between the Hinawi and Ghafri tribes has returned to Maskat, his mission having effected nothing.” (Cf. paros. 978-982.) 1026- Sale of the Customs Farm at Maskat.— The period of the annual contract for customs having expired, the Sultan, on 22nd November, gave the new contract to a company for $115,000.
