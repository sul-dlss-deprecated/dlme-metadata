TEHRAN to ASTARABAD. Distance 241 miles. 25 Stages. Authority and date. —Ouseley, 1811 ; Holmes, 1844 ; Napier, 1874; Picot, 1894; Douglas, , 1906; Maclean, 1889; Sykes, 1893; Fortescue, 1920. Epitome .—This route is divided into three sections (a) Tehran to Amul, (&amp;) Amul to Bandar-i-Gaz. (c) Bandar-i-Gaz to Astarabad. (Note. Section (b) is very little used beyond Barfarush. In wet weather the road east of Barfarush across the Mazandaran plain becomes atrocious and travellers from Tehran to Astarahad prefer the Tehran-Meshed road to Siiahrud and thence cross the mountains to Bandar-i-Gaz.) * (a) General .—This is known as the Lari]an road and is the main route from Tehran into Mazandaran, and is the route usually followed by cavarans going from Tehran to Amul, the chief rice producing district in Mazandaran, or to Barfarush, the commercial capital of the province, and its trading station of Meshed-i-Sar, except in mid-winter, when the longer but easier route via Damavand and Piruzkuh is preferred, vide Later 1 Route No. I {h). There is another road to Tehran from Amul via Galieh Nashal, Arjumand or Lazur, Naveh and Ah—total distance about 144 miles. This road is, however, seldom or never used by caravans, and part of the country it traverses is little inhabited except in the summer months. ^ The road was made by the Austrian Engineer-General Gasteiger Khan ; it is practicable for Ford vans and carts to the point where it leaves the Damavand road [Lateral Route No. I (h) in stage 2 j and after that for mule transport only. Supplies .—There are many populous villages in Larijan in stages 3 and 4 above the defile of Haraz, and this district should be able to maintain a force of 2,000 men and 800 animals for some weeks after the harvest. Owing to the large consumption2 Route No. I— contd. of barley by local animals, rice would have to be mixed with barley for more than about 200 animals. The position of Larijan on the chief trade route, and midway between Khar, Varanln and Ma :andarSn, facilitates the provision of supplies from without. , Stages 4 (Barjah) and 5 (Parusp) are caravansarais which only, keep supplies for muleteers, but there are villages situated within 4 miles of them, whence supplies can be fetched. ^ Transport. Larijan is the chief mule owning district in the Elburn Mules are said to number at least 5000, 800 to 900 of them belonging to the village of Naunal. Water .—Supply plentiful. Physical obstacles .—-The Imamzadeh Hashim pass in sta °'0 3 is difficult. The stages along the valley of the rlaraz river, 3 to 5, are liable to be blocked by landslips, and are dangerous in winter and early spring. 8 Remarks.—The defile in stage 4 could easily be defended against a force advancing from the north. Ihs total distance to Meshed-i-Sar by this route is 145A miles in 8 stages, as compared with 163£ miles in 10 stages by Lateral Route No. I (h) via Firuzkuh, which is however easier A Iternalive routes.—From Tehran to Palur. This is not much used by caravans, but is 7-| miles shorter than the main route. (b) General .—The route follows the line of Shah ’Abbas’ ancient causeway, originally a highway with a paved surface 20 feet wide, now so broken up that the road generally runs by the side of it. This road has deservedly the worst reputation and is a by-word even in Mazandaran. In wet weather, which may occur at any season, it becomes a morass, especially in stage 9 from Barfarush to Sari which frequently becomes prac tically impassable for animals. Suitable for mule and pony transport. Stage 11 is passable for field artillery. The vabd a sturdy little pony, is the transport animal of the district and can travel better through the mud of the plain than the mule which excels in the hills. Animals from the plateau of Persia* suffer from sores and swellings of the legs. All the rivers are bridged except the Talar (stage 8 ), which is unfordable when in hood. The making of a good cart-road would be a work of some labour, as it would have to be well raised above the swamps and stone is only obtainable from the hills. &gt;Route No. l—contd. Wood abundant. Water supply from streams is plentiful but liable to surface pollution. Supplies .—In Arnul, Barfarush and Sari supplies are plentiful. Rice is obtainable throughout Mazandaran in great quantities. During the temperate season fish, sheep, dairy produce and vegetables are abundant, and 1,000 men should be supplied at all stages at 2 days’ notice. Fiour might be deficient and require fetching from the towns as the Mazandaranis are rice-eaters. Wheat is imported from hill districts to the south ; a little also is grown in the lowlands, but this is unwholesome and causes dizziness and sickness to persons not accustomed to it. From April to October when flocks and herds are grazing in the highland pastures, supplies are rather scarce. Animal rations are plentiful but indifferent. Rice and rice straw are poor substitutes for animals accustomed to barley and bhoosa, and the straw is unpalatable to them. Many animals at first refuse to eat it and rapidly lose condition. Barley is fetched from the hills and is scarce except in the towns. Lowland grown barley is of poor quality. A Persian telegraph line runs from Barfarush to Galugah, Astarabad and Shahrud. Alternatives .—Between stages 7 and 9, a road can be followed along the beach. (e) General .—Road much cut up by unbridged canals, and is very difficult for guns. In dry weather, which can never be counted on, a roadway could easily be made. Plenty of wood available. In wet weather the road is exceedingly difficult. Horses for posting are kept up. Supplies and water at Kurd Mahalleh. No drinking water in summer at Bandar-i-Gaz. This is an important route, as it connects the landing place of Bandar-i-Gaz (the nearest point on the Caspian) with Astarabad and the valuable strategical point, Shahrud. Professor Zolotareff in his “ Military-Geographical account of the frontier of Russia,” 1903, refers to Bandar-i-Gaz—Shahrud as practicable for guns. There used to be a Russian Naval station, with a good harbour at Ashurada Island, 7 miles north of Bandar-i-Gaz. The latter consists of a few houses and shops, and has a pier, 350 paces long and 8 feet wide. Boats drawing several feet can lie against the sea end. Would be a good landing place for troops. There used to be an agent of the Caucasus Mercury Navigation4 Route No. I— contd. Company here and a telegraph office, also a customs-house and two caravansarais. In summer drinking water has to be fetched from Kurd Mahalleh. Climate .—Throughout Sections ( 6 ) and (c) the summer climate is hot, excessively humid and malarial. June, July and August are the worst months. Ho. of stage i Tehran by the Shimran gate and goes straight across the plain passing the Doshan Tappeh mound on the right hand at 5 miles and rising gently to Surkh Hissar (10 houses) at 11 miles. To the right off the road are a country house and garden belonging to the Shah. To the left a good track leads through several villages to Qulhak, about 10 miles. Several villages are situated to the left (N.), aloncr the Shimran slopes, but the plain is barren. It is traversed by innumerable qanats. ^ From Surkh Hissar the road climbs steadily up a barren water course to low sand and rubble hills at 13J miles, whence it aoes down hill to a stonebridge of 4 arches over the Jajarud stream which is easily fordable unless in flood. The valley is mile wide commanded by low hills. There is a toll house 100 yards and big caravansarais | mile beyond the bridge. They provide barley and fodder, but other supplies must be fetched from Kamard (150 houses), 3 miles distant to the N.-E. There are no villages in Ja.arud valley within some miles of the bridge. and total distance. Details. 1 JAJARUD .. 17 m. Pack animals 7 hrs. 17 TO. General direction E.- N-E.

General direction N.- * E. Gradual , ascent 53 to. to the pass of Imarm zadeh Hashim at about 5 miles. Steep and rocky pathway, but Persian mules have no difficulty in carrying loads over it. Elevation 8,700 feet. This pass is closed in winter for a fort night or so. There is a caravansarai on the crest. Thence into the Palur valley. For Palur, vide Alternative Routes Nos. 1 and 2. The pass can also be reached by a longer road via Damavand village and Masha. At 9J miles the road passes Palur caravansarais and small willow trees by a stream (good water and camping ground in summer, but no village or sup plies), and at 10 miles crosses the Ear by a bridge. From 10J to 12J miles the road is paved with big stones and full of holes. To 18J miles it winds tortuously round gullies and over shoulders of hill on slopes leading up to Mount Damavand, and is liable to scouring and landslips in spring. (A branch track descends very steeply to Ask, about 900 houses and the principal village of Lari jam. It is a summer resort known for its sulphur baths, but semi-deserted in winter when people go down to Amul. It is congested in a narrow space on the bank of the Haraz, surrounded by cliffs and affords no room for a camp. There is a single arch bridge over the Haraz of 22 / span.) The main route keeps up along the mountain side to Rahnah (bazaar and supplies), 2 miles above Ask. There is a good camping ground in terraced meadows by a brook* mile beyond Rahnah. The valley of Larijan is a wide basin, at the bottom of which the river Haraz runs through a narrow cleft of rock, bordered by mountains, in which are numerous side valleys with large villages. Supplies for several hundred men and animals could be collected in this district. The road is broad through this stage, but the surface is very rough over the Imamzadeh Hashim ridge and beyond Palur.6 Route No. I—contd. 4 BAlJAN -• 15 m. General direction N.-N.-E. 0 g m . From Rahnah is a 3 miles’ descent, steep in parts, down a good track to the left bank of the Haraz, which has now emerged from its ravines, where it meets the branch track via Ask, h miles below a stone bridge. The river is swift, rocky and difficult to ford. At 5 miles pass a side valley from the left with a view of Damavand, at miles cross the river by a bridge and at 6 miles recross by another bridge to the left bank below a cleft Between two big rocks, where the road is built up above the river, which has become a torrent. The road makes a slight ascent to'Wahna and then continues the descent, reaching the river bank opposite to the thickly populated valley of Amirieh to which a track branches off across a single span brick bridge. The villages hereabouts are surrounded by fine vine yards and orchards and the contrast between the rugged moun tains and exceptional fertility is striking. The valley is open but has a steep drop. The surface of the road is excellent to 9f- miles where it enters the narrow gorge of the Haraz. The. narrowest point of the defile is 30 yards and the average width is 50 yards. The road, which was built in 1878, is cut in the cliff above the left bank of the river past a bas-relief and is paved with stones. The old road, traces of which are still to be seen, ran along the rocky precipices at a height of 200 '. The gorge is about 1 mile in length and at the exit from it into a narrow barren valley the road crosses a stone bridge to the right bank and keeps on that side to Baijan, passing two strips of cultivation but no villages. At Baljan are several caravansarais with supplies for ordinary caravans, but no village, and the valley widens out a little. The surface of the road from the defile to Baijan is rough. This defile marks the transition between the yailaq, or summer highland quarters, of Larijan, and the qishldq, or lowlands. The difference in temperature is very marked and the valley below it is very hot in summer. It is a strong natural defile, about 1 mile in length and is the only easy and direct entrance on the northern side to I.arijan. The road through it could be immediately destroyed by blasting.t Route No. I— contd. 5 PARUSP .. .. 23f m. General direction slightly E. of N. 91^m. Road follows the right bank of the river as far as Mahmudabad one mile below Baijan, and then crosses to the left bank. At 4| miles the caves of Kuhrud which are often made a halting place by caravans. Ther e is a bridge standing high and dry under which the present road passes. 400 or 500 travellers sometimes take shelter there. The village of Kuhrud, 100 houses, lies behind a hill to the right. The valley is narrow ; slopes precipitous, rocky and destitute of vegetation, till last 2 or 3 miles of the stage ; summits almost inaccessible. Rocks, slate, limestone and black and white marble. Occasional indications of coal, with limestone strata below and clay above : trap very frequent, forming entire spurs. The descent for the stage is 2,700 feet. Prom Baijan to a tea shop at 41- miles is fair, but from 4| to 7J miles becomes very rocky and tedious. {Note. Another estimate makes the distance 10 miles, not 7J). At ;7f miles ford the Panjab river, where Lateral Route No. I {p) joins and then cross Baraz, by a stone bridge. More caves, used as shelters, in valley of Punjab, and a village not visible from road. Then along right bank of Haraz, by the large village of ’Aliabad, which gives its name to the Haraz bridge, at 81- miles, to Kaluband, a halting place for caravans, 11 miles. Accommodation in caves, no supplies. Ford the small Hardariid steam, and at 17| miles cross to left bank by bridge at Lash. The Haraz river is joined by the Nur from the W. and- then flows due E. as fai as the toll-house of Siabushi (on the right bank), where it turns N. again. Lateral Route No. I {p) comes in here. Parusp (left bank) is a roadside station, with a house belonging to the Governor of the district, and a bath built for his use. There is public accommodation in the shape of dark caves cut in an old gravel bank of river. No supplies procurable, except barley. 6 AMfjL .. ..19 m. General direction N. Road for first 6 miles 1 1 0|-m. N. along bank, 50 to ^0 feet above stream, slopes becoming gradually more wooded and less pfepipitous, as valley descends. Thence, still following left bank of Haraz, road passes over firm grand turf. Valley open with fine park-like scenery to 12 miles. Thence to 14 or8 Route No. I—contd. 15 miles road is deep and heavy in forest of alder, oak, and elm, which fills valley of Haraz, and rises to 4,000 feet or 5,000 feet up mountain slopes. At 14 miles cross* canal by stone bridge, and pass village of Alam-Sar, 8 houses. The new road from Tehran and Damavand, followed so far, here falls into the old track. Thence to Amul the track runs N. beside the Haraz, over undulating country well cultivated with rice. Canals numerous but shallow, and fields slightly fenced. The Haraz has a good sound gravelly bed and is fordable everywhere, except after spring floods. Country descends to within 5 or 6 miles of Amul. Canals make it difficult to cross. The banks of river are high and well-wooded. Amul has a summer popu lation of 5,000 or less, and about 8,000 in winter. The summer climate and mosquitoes are particularly bad owing to its posi tion in the centre of a big rice producing district, and the inha bitants migrate to the highlands of Larljan. Xur Amin Hukarram is the influential land owner of the district. Amul is much decayed, and has only been partially rebuilt after a destructive fire and is more like a large village than a town. The streets are narrow and bad, and the bazaars small. Sup plies are less plentiful than at Barfarush or Sari. Wheat can be imported from Larijan, but owing to the large number of local animals Larijan has little surplus of barley. Wheat and barley can also be fetched from the Kujur district. About 200 British other ranks, 500 Indian other ranks and 600 animals could be maintained. The Haraz is spanned by a fine stone bridge of 12 arches. An attempt was made many years ago by Haji Muhammad Hasan, a merchant, to develop Mahmudabad at the mouth of river about 12 miles due N. of Amul as a P ort -_ He built warehouses and a light railway from Mah mudabad to Amul.

Two miles from Barfarush cross the Babul river by a fine wide stone bridge of 9 arches (Pul-i-Muhammad Hasan Khan). In 1920 it had fallen to disrepair and was in a precarious condition. Stream, deep and muddy with quicksands ; fords every 2 or 3 miles, but after heavy rain unfordable. Bank steep and wooded.

Summer climate is worse than Sari, but less bad than Amul. Excellent camping ground, 1 square mile in extent, on grass meadow at Ahmad Kulah, 4 miles N. near Meshed-i- Sar road. In 1920. the town was in a very depressed condition owing to cessation of trade with Russia on which its prosperity depended. Population is mercantile and peaceful and keeps aloof from political intrigues, which centre round Sari.

Wherever thei e have been water-courses there have been originally bridges, which in most places are now destroyed, and it is in these parts that the causeway is so broken up. During this march it is in much better condition than between ’All a bad and Barfarush. It is of different width in different places, but generally about 20 feet, with a ditch on each side.10 Route No. I— contd. After passing the Siah R':d, turn off into forest, and, having crossed several large patches of rice swamp arrive at village of Afrakut, and 3 miles further on come to Aratah. Continuing march over a beautiful smooth turf along the foot of hills, pass village of SurkI Kaleh. Some distance further on, at 2 miles from Sari, again fall in with the causeway along which continue to the city, altogether about 3 farsakhs distant from ’Allahad. Causeway is here about 20 feet wide and in good condition ; it is not paved as before, but has the appearance of a good English country road. Sari is situated in a flat plain on the left bank of the river Tejen, bounded by mountains to the N.-E. and S.-W. Population in 1920 estimated at 10,000 in summer, 11,000 in winter. Sari is a residential and not a commercial'town, and is usually the administrative capital of Mazandatan. Chief land- owner is Sardar Jaid. Summer climate is less unhealthy than in most parts of Ala 'and a ran plain. Supplies throughout year for 5,000 British other ranks, 1,500 Indian other lanks and 600 animals. Wheat and barley are imported from the hill district of Iiazar J arib up the Tejen valley. Transport is scarcer than at Barfarush or Amul as little carrying trade passes through Sari. Water from db-ambdr, which are kept in good repair, and filled by open canals from Tejen, so water is liable to surface pollution. Camping ground in Bagh-i-Shah, or at Ali Bagh, 3 miles N. by a fine large spring, whence drinkino' water is fetched to Sari. The road from Barfarush to Sari is a byword for badness even in Mazandaran, where all roads become more or less execrable when wet. In dry weather the surface is largely rough sunbaked mud and in wet weather animals flo'indef girth-deep in the morass and are sometimes drovmed. In fact after heavy rain the road is considered practically impassable. In many parts also it follows narrow sloping embankments between reservoirs, which are slippery and dangerous when wet. , -Ato alternative route from Barfarush to Ashraf goes to the sea coast at Meshed-i-Sar, 12 miles [see Lateral Route I (A)] and then foiled it , ^ Paiahabad, [see Alternative Stage (3)] the mouth of the Tejen, 14 miles from Sari and connected with it by a fair route.

There are usually lllat camps dotted all over the valley. . There are tracks down both sides of the stream, which is fordable everywhere. The valley of the Lar, though partly stony and quite uncultivated and treeless, has tracts of meadow here and there, sufficient to support 1,000 good mares, besides a great number of flocks of sheep and goats during the summer. It is, however, quite deserted during the winter, and has no fixed population. The families of goatherds and shepherds import their bread-stuff from their winter homes of Varamin, etc. Yurt-i-Khan Lar Khan is one of the best of the many encamping grounds which this valley provides. Lofty cone of Damavand dominates the valley. iVofe.—From here to Damavand is 12 miles. Time, 4 hours. Road follows the Lar river through more or less grassy land for 7 miles, crossins the river itself and a tributary of white sulphurous water which joins it on left bank. This tributary, rises at a remarkable sulphur spring known as Div Anab or “ Devil’s Watermill.” At 7 miles from Yurt-i-Khan Lar Khan the Lar valley is contracted by the lava flow which,formerly issuing from Damavand and impinging on much contorted limestone rocks, dammed it up, forming a large lake. A stream, the Dali Chai, coming from the W. slope of the extinct volcano, joins the main river at this point, viz., where it enters a deep gorge which it has cut through the igneous and limestone rocks. Road to Ask follows the river, but that for Damavand keeps to right from the confluence or the Ab-i-Safid, i.e., 3 2 miles from Yurt-i- Khan Lar Khan, and, passing through the mountains, after 5 miles the main road from Tehran to Amul is reached : these 5 miles are rough from here. Turn* ing S.-W. it ascends for 4 miles up to Imamzadeh Hashim, whence it descends along the ridge of the mountains in a zigzag to Damavand in a S.-S.E. direction, Damavand is more of a town than a village, having a Governor and a population numbering about 5,000, and its neighbourhood is well-cultivated. Sheep and fruit are plentiful, but the local crops of wheat and barley are insufficient for the population, who import their requirements fronj .Varamin. 4 PALfjR (7,020') .. 12 m.

Below this is a wide, open, grassy space, marshy in places. At 3 miles the palichai river is crossed. Below this the hills close in on the river, which runs through a gorge. From here there are two paths to Palur ; one which has crossed a low ridge from SiahRoute No. I— contd. Pa!as on the S, and the other on the N. of the river. The nor thern path passes over easy slopes and offers no difficulty for mules. Hills treeless and bare; cultivation in patches. The track keeps along the left bank of the river and above it to 13 miles, where it descends to river level and crosses to the right bank by a stone bridge. The road is said to be a fair mule track. Palur practically marks the limit of the Lar valley, and is the name given to some cultivation on the slopes of the valley of Imamzadeh Hashim, only worked during the summer months from Bahnah, at' other times untenanted. No supplies are available. No village ; grazing plentiful in summer. It is a place of some importance commanding four valleys-— (1) The northern along which the Lar drainage flows to the sea. (2) The southern or valley of Imamzadeh Hashim, leading to the town of Damavand and the plains of Varamin. (3) The western, leading to the Lar pastures. (4) The eastern, leading to FIruzkuh, commonly known as the Ghazan Chai valley. * Alternative Stage 2. ! TEHRAN to PALUR via LAVASAN and LAR. Distance 49 miles. 3 stages.

The road lies south of continuous sand dunes, and traverses thorny jungle to the Slahrudbar, about 3 miles from Mahmudabad. Thence it goes along the' beach to the Tufanga where there is a fishery. It next crosses the Ahlameh and the Shilit, which latter has 2 mahalhhs, the upper on the left bank with about 50 houses, and the lower on the right with 30 houses. The boundary between Amul and Barfarush is then reached. The path from this point is green and pleasant and bordered with undergrowth as far as the mahallehs of Surkhrud, which are divided by a stream of the same name and consist of about 150 houses. The Surkhrud is 4 D paces in breadth. After leaving Surkhriid a muddy extent of thick jungle, varied by divers green spots, is traversed. Wizreh mahalleh (10 or 15 houses) is passed to the left and the Shlreh Rad is reached. After crossing this stream the path goes along the beach to I arikinar, at which place there is a ferry across the river. Farikinar numbers 200 huts, of which 30 are used as shops, and is situated on the left bank of a broad stream, sometimes called after the village and occasionally styled the Haraz, of which it appears to be a branch.

The first mahalleh of Meshed-i- Sar, which is a very scattered and straggling place, is on the left bank of the Babul and is called Safi Mahalleh; Meshed-i- Sar has 500 houses, a T, 0., a P. 0, large customs house and concrete wharf for river boats and a fishery station. It is a considerable trading centre for export of rice and cotton, etc., to Russia and import of Russian goods for Tehran by Main Route No. I. The Babfd flows from the Safid Kuh, and large quantities of fish are caught in it. The river, which is very broad (200 paces), is crossed in a ferry boat—a lengthy operation. Leaving Meshed-i-Sar, the road goes E.-N.-E, through scattered jungle. To the left sand hills hide the sea from view : to the right there is a spacious murdab where vast numbers of waterfowl are caught, extending from an imdmzadeh just outside Meshed-i- Sar to the river Mlrrud, a distance of 3 miles. Pass the old mouth of the Babul and reach Mirrud, which is deep, but not broad ; it is crossed by a ferry. On the right bank above the ferry is the mahalleh of Baghlrtangeh (20 to 25 houses).

Damgkan ... 4,farsakhs.Route No. II—contd. The road .—The road may be described as generally desert with, a more or less gravelly track. Cultivation exists around every village and town, and wherever there is cultivation, the road is cut up badly by the water used for irrigation purposes being taken across it. The track passes through the bed of a stream in a gbrge, varying in width from 50 yards to half a mile, in stage 3. The only mountainous parts are in stage 7. Water-courses and river-beds cause delay to heavy wheeled traffic in April and May—that is, during the spring floods, when the snow melts on the mountains—in the first 8 miles of stage 2 , from Khatunabad to Sharifabad ; also in the first 3 farsaJchs of stage 4 from Qishlaq to ’ Allabad on the carriage road. The road is never repaired. At present a new “ motor road ” is in course of construction between Tehran and Samnan and is to be carried on to Meshed. A Belgian engineer was in 1907 in charge of the work, which is being financed by a Persian company. About 500 men were employed in digging ditches on both sides of the road and in slightly “ barrelling ” its centre. The new road is 9 Persian zars wide (approximately 30£ feet). The ditches are from 2 to 8 feet deep, according to locality and to the quantity of water they are likely to carry. It was said that other working parties were soon to start work on the surface of the road and to build bridges and culverts. The contract price for laying out and digging the ditches was krans 1,500 per farsakh. Climate.—Caravans generally travel at night all the year round, but there is no necessity for this from September to June. Between the 1st of June and the middle of September the heat on the bare plains is excessive, but many groups of pilgrims, mounted on their own animals, force their way through in the day-time. Snow often falls at Ahuan, stage 7, from November to May, but rarely blocks the road. Supplies. Supplies along the road are generally sufficient for the ordinary traffic. At outlying stations they are liable to be scarce in spring. The collection of large supplies would always be difficult, except immediately after the harvest ( 1 ) in the Varamin District22 Route No. ll—contd. which extends 80 miles east of Tehran, and (2) in the neighbour hood of Damghan. “ Supplies ” in the text must be understood to mean bread mast (curds), Persian cheese, eggs, barley, hay and chopped straw only. ^ Milk is procurable in spring only and consists of cow’s, sheep s and goat’s milk mixed. Ordinary butter is not procur able,^ but boiled butter for cooking known as raughan is avail able m every town. The places where meat is procurable are noted in the text Water.- The water is rather brackish throughout, and is particularly bad in stages 3, 4, 5 and 6 , being inclined to cause dysentery. It imparts a bitter taste to soup, porridge, etc., and will not make cocoa. Water for any number of animals is obtainable at every stage. Mahlcs or ponds are formed at places where running water is not always available. ^ Grazing. Grazing for camels may be said to be good through- cut Muleteers’ animals are also taken out to graze, when the cultivated area surrounding the village is not too extensive, i arge nocks of sheep and goats graze all along the road. There is no grass, and all animals feed on the tender tops of the brush wood and the sparse weeds which grow between. Fuel. Charcoal in small quantities is generally procurable at every stage, and in larger quantities in the towns. Wood is STtages^dg ! 1 -Pitifulthroughout, especially Transport.—F&amp;ck animal transport is being rapidly supersed draw^lT light ’ s P™g&gt;ess EusJn wagon mail W 7 r i 10rSe f abreas V s used for the conveyance of the mails, and also for pilgrims and other travellers of limited means who are travelling “ post.” The same kind of vehicle is u“ed foi Reverr| 1VeyanCe ° f ° rdmary mercii andise, on the top of which several passengers are generally perched.

Caravans generally start between 8 p.m. and midnight, arriv ing at the next stage between sunrise and 9 a.m. If the neigh bourhood is suitable, the animals are taken out to graze during the day. The allowance of barley for mules and horses is from 6 d to 10 or even 12 lbs. per diem, according to the age and size of the animal and the work it has to perform. They are fed with barley twice daily, morning and evening, and if not grazing, are kept supplied with chopped straw and a very small proportion of hay. Under the heading of “ Transport,” in the text, the post horses are not included. There are from 12 to 14 horses kept at each post-station, and these animals are generally in good, hard condition, and used for both riding and driving. It should be noted that in the spring it is difficult or impossible to hire mules in Persia, as it is the custom for muleteers to take their animals into the mountains (on this road towards Mazan- daran) where there is splendid grazing, and to keep them there for from one to two months. Camel caravans do not keep to the same stages as mules, but unload anywhere in the desert where there is good grazing. Camels invariably travel at night. When grazing is poor, they are fed on chopped straw and on a stiff dough made from barley flour. Physical obstacles .—There are no physical obstacles which are not overcome daily, both by lightly laden carriages and by heavily laden waggons. It is usual, however, for 2 or 3 heavily laden waggons to travel together, so that they may help each other over difficult places, such as those referred to under the heading The road. Alternative stages .—(Stage 1.) The alternative stage is via Shah ’Abdul ’Azim, in a southerly direction, thence to the east, jbining the road described in the text at Jub-i-Fariad, about 5 miles west of Khatiinabad. This route is generally?- followed by pilgrim caravans for religious purposes, there being a shrine at Shah ’Abdul ’Azim. Heavily laden waggons also prefer this route, as it avoids the low pass on the post-road. Muleteers and waggon ers often make Shah ’Abdul ’Azim the first stage of the journey. The disadvantage of the alternative stage is that it is 4 miles longer, and the track is considerably cut up by water-courses. %24 Boutb No. II— contd. Stages 1 and 2 . —There is also an alternative track, now used almost exclusively by camels, between Tehran and Aivan-i- Kaif. Stage, 4. —The route described in the text, from the 8 th to the 11 th mile, is considered impassable for wheeled traffic, but the Assistant Superintendent, Telegraphs, continually takes a small four-wheeled waggon this way, detailing men to assist in difficult places. Instead of turning east to the conspicuous village of Aradan at the 8 th mile, wheeled traffic continues towards the north-east to the poor village of ’Aliabad ; thence the road skirts the foot of the mountains in an easterly direction for 2 or 3 miles; then, pursuing a more southerly course, crosses the plain and joins the road described in the text at the 11 th mile. East of ’Aliabad the track is firm, but is crossed by numerous torrent beds. Stage 7 . Samnan to Ahuan. Wheeled traffic leaves the road described in the text about 5 miles east of Samnan, the roads branching near a conspicuous brick-built entrance to what is referred to locally as an ab-ambur . It is actually the entrance to a series of about 90 steps leading down to a qandt. The caravan route here turns in a northerly direction, the telegraph line following the same route. The waggon road continues in an easterly direction for about 2 miles, until clear of a projecting spur of the mountains, then turns north, running parallel to the caravan road, which it rejoins between the two tea-houses, both known as Chash Giran, at 16 miles. The waggon road is exceedingly heavy going, the road being the bed of a torrent— vide text for particulars of another road, which could easily be made practicable for vehicles. Stages for froops.—Alternative halting places, with their resources, are pointed out in the text. Miscellaneous. —The branch telegraph lines are : ( 1 ) That from Samnan to Flruzkuh which is always in bad repair and workable only in very dry weather. This road is quite safe for even small caravans, but individuals are occasionally held up by bands consisting of 3 or 4 men indifferently armed.Rcutb No. IT — contd. No. of stage and total distance. Details. 1 KHATJNABAD .. 18 m. Leaving Tehran by '■ the Dulab or Meshed 18m. Gate, the road follows a south-easterly direction through the cultivation belonging to the prosperous village of Dulab, which is left on the north at one mile. At 4 miles, small caravansarai and tea-house known as ’AH Kashi. A qcinat passes underneath this sarai, whence good water is drawn by a bucket and rope, or the water may be reached by descend ing some 10 or 12 steps. The water comes to the surface at the village of Ashraiabad about a mile south of the road. The route now begins to ascend the pass or gardaneh. On the south, well up on the side of the hill, the Parsis’ white “ Tower of Silence ” is conspicuous, and on the north the open valley shows the Shah’s Palace of Dushan Tappeh standing on the top of a solitary hill, about 2 miles distant. The track, which up to now has been alluvial, now becomes firm and gravelly, and remains so for the next 8 miles. A few hundred yards up the hill, the track is crossed by a much used road from the stone quarries near the village of Miskarabad in the hills to the north-east, running past the south front of the small sarai referred to above, to the Shah ’Abdul ’Azlm Gate of Tehran. Large quantities of stone in irregular pieces are usually stacked near the sarai. Half a mile up the hillside on the quarry road (not the main road), another tea-house is passed, which has a good db-ambdr underneath it. The Tehran-Meshed telegraph line follows the main road. The highest point is reached at 6 miles, whence a last view of Tehran may be had ; the road then slopes towards the east between the hills. At 7J miles the hills on the south cease, and an uninterrupted view of the Varamin plain is obtained. A small enclosure and tea-house known as Chashmeh-i-Zalu (the leech spring) is passed on the bare hillside at 10 miles. In watering animals at the tiny stream which crosses the road care must be taken to avoid the leeches which are abundant hers26 Route No. II — contd. _ The village of Muhammadabad, which is on the alternative road via Shah ’Abdul ’Azlm, will be noticed at the foot of the slope towards the south, whilst numerous villages are visible beyond this, and cultivation appears to be general. This district is part of that under the Governor of Varamin, from which place a large proportion of the wheat, barley, hay and straw, required for Tehran, is drawn. The road descends the eastern slope, curving towards the north to avoid some deep water-worn clefts. At 13 miles level ground is reached, and'here the road via Shah ’Abdul ’Azlm joins, and the track becomes alluvial, rendering the ground very heavy going after rain for vehicles. At 16 mile the tea-house of Daqalan is passed, and the road for the next 2 miles is frequently inundated by water taken across it for irrigation purposes. After 18 miles, generally through a slough of mud, turn off to the right to the brick sarai of Khatunabad, with a village of about 50 houses behind it. S Supplies .—Are always rather scarce here. Water .—From an db-ambar for drinking purposes ; animals are watered at a stream on the south side of the sarai. Fuel .—Scarce and dear. Grazing. —Towards the north on the hillsides, good. Livestock. —From 300 to 400 head of cattle, and about 500 sheep and goats. The village taxes in 1906 amounted to 300 khanvdrs of wheat, 300 kharicdrs of barley, and 6,000 krdns cash, but the villagers were unable to pay 60 kharicdrs of the wheat. The above is considered as one-half of the produce of the village. There is a second and smaller sarai, built of mud, on the north side of the road, just beyond the turning towards the brick sarai. 2 AIVlN-I-KAIF .. 28 m. General direction east for 8 miles, then south - east. Road bad in wet weather for 8 miles, after that good. At 1£ miles pass on the north village of Mamazan. Track alluvial. Difficult for vehicles where irrigation water crosses road. On south of road pass the villages of Guheh and Palisht. At 3 miles reach the torrent bed known as the Rudkhaneh- i-Alhak. This is really a branch of the Jajarud. When in floodRoute No. II—contd. it is about 250 yards across, and the current is swift but shallow. Heavy wheeled traffic is sometimes stopped here for a day or two during the spring floods, which occur in April or May. From this point up to Sharifabad, 5 miles, the road is cut up badly by water-courses and torrent and river-beds, by which this branch of the Jajarud discharges itself on to the Varamin plain. The going is so difficult that frequently waggons, and sometimes muleteers, make only 2 farsakhs this stage, that is from Khatuna- bad to Sharifabad. The thin wheels of the waggons sink deeply into every water-course, and have to be dug out by spades carried for this purpose by every waggoner. These remarks must be understood to apply in their full force to the spring, when water is plentiful. The difficulties diminish as the summer advances, and in the autumn practically cease to exist. At 4 miles, the small village and large sarai of Alhak, on the north, are passed. The village has now no habitable houses, and the sarai is frequently without a tenant. In 1907 4 men were living there, paying the following taxes to the owner of the place. For the sarai, krdns 420 ; for the mill, krdns 1,000 ; and for the trees, kra,ns 580, total krdns 2,000. About a mile north of Alhak is the village of Kabud-i-Gumbaz which was formerly a post-station. At 6 miles the prosperous village of Khusru on the south, about half a mile off the road. It possesses a mud-built sarai of medium size. Sharifabad, 8 miles. A fairly large mud-built sarai, having only 4 or 5 rooms for travellers ; other accommodation is obtain able in the village. Supples. —Plentiful. Livestock .—About 500 cattle and 1,200 sheep. Water. —Plentiful, several large streams running near and through the village. Grazing .—On the banks of the streams good, on the plains very fair. FrteL—Brushwood plentiful. Wood scarce. Transport .—-The villagers possess about 20 donkeys, but no other beasts of burden. Leaving Sharifabad towards the south east, the track is gravelly and hard, so that no difficulty is ex perienced in crossing the 2 or 3 streams encountered at 2 miles, where the road curves towards the north to avoid a marshy28 Route No. Il—contd. depression. At the end of the curve the village of AfarTn is seen towards the south, distant about a mile. At 16 miles, the village of Kaleh Umr on the south with an avenue of trees leading from the road to the village. A large tea-house is established on the road-side, where a fine qand! of slightly brackish water rises to the surface. Thence the road is firm and flat up to 26 miles, where the ruins of the ancient town of Aivan-i-Kaif are passed. Here the caravantrackturnsslightiy to the north whilst the only practi cable road for vehicles keeps to the southerly track. The zsaravan track passing to the north of the ruins, which, it should be noted, are level with the ground, arrives at the village of Aivan-i-Kaif by narrow and tortuous lanes, full of deep mud-holes. The village is built on both banks of the river; the only bridge consists of 2 or 3 tree trunks. A ruined masonry bridge exists a little way up the stream. The post-house and telegraph office are on the west bank, and the sarai and a few shops are on the east bank. The river varies from a mere trickle in summer and autumn to a strong torrent after rain and in the flood season. It must be forded. t . 'P 16 wa ggon road passes south of the ruins and near an old brick sarai which is never used by travellers, and in which a few tribesmen have taken up their residence. Continuing in the same general direction the road passes south of the enclosed plots of cultivation, and, bearing to the north as it approaches the river, crosses it just south of the village.

At 8 miles enter the defile known as the Darreh-i- Aivan-i-Kaif. Just outside the entrance to this defile, the road dips into a hollo w and crosses an insignificant stream by means of a small makeshift bridge. This stream contains comparatively fresh water, the last that is met with on this stage. The water in the ravine is intensely salt. In the defile, the road crosses and recrosses the stream many times and in places the only practicable road for vehicles is in its bed. Duringheavy floods the stream is rapid and deep. Portions of the road are continually being swept away by it. At 10 miles the defile opens on to a small plain, where stands a small tea-house with 2 or 3 spare rooms for travellers and stables. A large db-ambdr has lately been built here, but the water is salt. Cultivation is attempted, but is not successful owing to the saline nature of the soil. At 12 miles the ravine opens on to the Qishlaq plain, the road turning abruptly to the E. as soon as the defile is left. Two or three patches of soft, salt soil delay vehicles at 14 miles. At 18 miles the village of Husainabad, distant about one mile to the S., is passed, and at 19 miles Deh-i-Nau. Qishlaq is reached at 20 miles, generally through sloughs of mud caused by the over flow of irrigation water. This is a prosperous village of about 100 houses. Wheat, barley, hay, cotton, opium and a little rice are grown. Supplies.—Good. Mutton sometimes on sale, and goat’s flesh always obtainable. Water .—Plentiful and good, from a large stream on the E. side of the village. Livestock .—About 2,000 sheep and goats and 100 cattle.

Road good between ‘ — and beyond river-beds. 88 w. General direction N.-E for 8 miles, then E. At the east end of the village cross a bridge over the stream ; the road lies through cultivation, which extends on both sides as far as the eye can reach. To the N. the village of Karind, distant about 2 miles, in the midst of cultivation. Many streams cross the road, and at 6 miles several shingly torrent beds. The caravan road now turns abruptly to the E. towards the conspicuous village of Aradan, which is built partly on a high artificial mound. The waggon road proceeds N.-E. to ’Allabad, as shown in the epitome. _At 8 miles, after passing through a lane full of mudholes, Aradan is reached. Here there is a telegraph station. From an agricultural point of view the surrounding district is a rich one. Corn is despatched to Tehran on one side and to Samnan on the other. Supplies .—Are good, especially at harvest time. Livestock .—Two thousand sheep and goats, 120 cattle. Water .—Several good streams. Grazing .—None in immediate neighbourhood, except after harvest. Fuel .—Brushwood plentiful. A little charcoal. Transport .—Fifteen horses, 40 donkeys, 4 or 5 camels. Leaving Araian towards the E. several streams are crossed, some of them spanned by indifferently constructed bridges. At 9 miles, pass on the N. the small village known as Kaleh Khurabeh, behind which are several patches of rice cultivation. The large artificial mound of Padeh, with the village nestliim around its base, is passed on the S. of the road, atlO miles. Up to this point the road has been through cultivated country. Now leaving the cultivation of Padeh, from the point of junction with the waggon road at 11 miles, a stretch of 4 miles of saltRoute No. ll~contd. clay is entered on. Beyond this there is a gentle rise and firm track all the way to Deh Namak. which can be seen on the horizon when leaving Aradan. At 18 miles, a small brackish stream crosses the road, with a tea-shop beside it. Deh Namak is a small village, huddled in a depression at the foot of a large artificial mound, on the top of which the village originally stood. There is a good brick ■surai, and also accom* modation in the square in front of the sarai for a large number of pilgrims and animals. A large upper room built over the tea-house is available for travellers. The length of the waggon road is about 24 miles. Supplies .—Sufficient for ordinary demands. Livestock .—‘One thousand five hundred goats, 500 sheen and 60 cattle. Water. —Plentiful, from a stream on east of sarai. The water is not particularly salt to the taste, but is extremely hard, and must contain a lot of lime. It will not mix with cocoa, and imparts a bitter taste to soup, porridge, etc. Grazing. —Fair. Fuel .—Brushwood only. Transport.—T wenty five donkeys, 10 horses, 3 or 4 camels. LASJIRD .. ., 28 in. Road good. General direction east. m - ’Abdulabad, the half* stage, may be seen on the eastern horizon, when leaving Deh Namak. Road hard and stony; slight descent through cultivation for two miles, then across desert. The track considerably cut up by small beds of streams. After 4 miles a gentle ascent. At 13 miles deep ravine capped by a ruined watch tower. The sides ol the ravine are not steep. ’Abdulabad, 16 miles, consists of a tea-house, and old, partly ruined sarai, now used as a post change house, and a large garden full of pomegranate trees. There is a good stream of hard, brackish water. Scanty supplies available. 1 Grazing. —Good. Livestock. One hundred sheep and goats. Cattle 10. Gazelle plentiful here m winter. Road continues E. over stony undulating plain, with slight descent for 4 miles, then fairly level track with good going for32 Route No. II— contd. vehicles. In this depression, -when there is no wind, a small fly or gnat exists in swarms. It is extremely irritating to both maxi and beast, but apparently, no evil effects follow the bite. At 21 miles reach the first of three small bridges, within a short distance of each other, over deep narrow gullies. At 24 miles the track dips into easy ravines, which carry water only in flood time. A ruined watch tower on the S. of the road, which now turns abruptly towards the N. At 25 miles, small building on the E., and at 28 miles a large building on the same side. Here wheeled traffic deflects to the right, to avoid narrow defiles in the hills. Mule track becomes narrow, skirting the hillside, and, after passing a mill situated on the side of a deep ravine, enters a very narrow defile in low chalk hills. Indian file only is practicable here for about 500 yards, after which emerge from hills on the Lasjird plain. The waggon road rejoins the mule track as the hills are left. Thence through cultivated plain to Lasjird, marked by a ruined village on an artificial mound. As at Aradan, Padeh and Deh Namak, the village has been rebuilt at the foot of the mound. There are also many gardens, mostly planted with pomegranates. The sarai is well-built. Latrines are provided outside where is also a capacious ab- ambdr. Supplies. Are always adequate for the ordinary traffic but are dear. Livestock. Large flocks of sheep and goats, about 4,000 at a rough estimate, cattle 150. Water.— Fot : drinking purposes plentiful, but quality the same as at Deh Narnak. Animals are generally watered by buckets from the db-ambdr, but water from a stream passing through the village is also available. Grazing. -Pair for horses and mules, good for camels, S. of the village. Good on the hills. L'uel .—Brushwood and a little fruit wood.

Through •i ■. cultivation for one mile, then road sweeps to N. to avoid a salt marshy depression.Route No. II— contd. The track Just here is bad after rain. At 3 miles the depression is left and road becomes undulating and stony. At 4 miles, small stream from N. with tea-house at road side, hence a gentle rise to Surkheh, 8 miles. This village possesses two scirais of fair capacity. Supplies. —Plentiful; there are two bread shops, quite an unusual feature in small villages in Persia. Water .—From ab-ambars and streams. Livestock .—Three thousand sheep and goats, 150 cattle. Fuel .—Brushwood and a little fruit wood. Transport .—Horses 10 , donkeys 100. Grazing. —Good. There is a shoeing-smith here. On leaving Surkheh there is a gentle rise for one mile over undulating ground, and then a long slope down towards Samnan, which is plainly discernible. The track is firm and the country desert. At 19 miles, a small enclosure with tea-house by road side. Water is drawn from a ganat. At 19J miles a cons picuous brick-built ab-ambdr which is broken and empty. At 20 miles, the road bifurcates, the caravan road continuing E. towards the southern end of the town, whilst the waggon road turns N. towards its northern extremity. The latter road is here described. Track is very rough and stony, and intersected by water-courses. At 22 miles, the outer limit of Samnan cultivation is reached, and the road crosses a wide shingly torrent-bed, which in flood time is full of shallow water. The telegraph line, which crosses the torrent-bed a little above the road, is that from Samnan to Firuzkah. A stream of good fresh water is crossed by a masonry bridge, the road turning more to the E. and skirting the enclosed gardens which lie to the S. At 23 miles, another stream of good water, and at 23-£ miles yet another, with a mill by the side of the road. Thence accross a plain which resembles a large drill square, leaving on the N. an old sarai which is now being used for preparing cotton for export. Crossing another stream, and passing between some walled gardens, we emerge on to a large square, the western end of which forms the burial ground. It is partly bounded on the N. by a large disused sarai, on the S. by the walls of th.e Ark, or Gover nor’s palace, and on the E. by some gardens between which th&lt;* road continues towards the E. C70GSB »34 Boitte No. W-rontd. Turning sharply towards the S., in the direction of the town, the two sdrais are on the traveller's right. A road about 12 feet wide between walled gardens leads to the town gate. Large wooden gates, which are never shut, guard the entrance to the narrow streets of the town. Here there is a telegraph office and post office, a very fair bazar, and a handsome mosque. There are many blacksmith’s and shoeing-smith’s shops. The best horse-shoes procurable on this road, and probably the best in Persia, are obtained here. The people of Samnan speak a dialect among themselves but all who have dealings with travellers speak Persian as well. aS' applies. —-Precarious. The cultivation around the town is insufficient to supply its wants and large quantities of wheat and barley are brought here from Aradan and Damghan. Rice is generally procurable. Goat’s flesh is the only meat on sale. Livestock .—Five thousand or 0,000 sheep and goats. Cows 100 . Water .—Plentiful and good from ab-ambar and streams. Orazinq. —Pair, some 2 or 3 miles N. Fuel. —-Brushwood, fruit wood and charcoal, fairly abundant.

Road good for 12 miles, then hilly and rough After passing between enclosed gardens for a short distance, emerge on to a large bare plain with gentle descent for 4 miles. Near the brick-built entrance to steps leading down to a qandt, the road bifurcates. The waggon road continues E whilst the caravan road turns N. in the same direction as the telegraph line. The caravan road is here described. At 9 miles, well up on the slope, a small tea-house by the a roadside. Water from a qandt may be obtained at the foot of a chalky hillock, about f mile W. of the road, opposite this tea houseRoute No. ll ~ contd . 1 Continuing N. -N.-E., at 12 miles the track becomes stony and enters hills. Here the road again bifurcates. That to the left or W., is a new road, which, with small amount of labour, could be made practicable for wheeled traffic, thus enabling the diffi cult road&gt; now followed by waggons* to be avoided. ° The ordinary caravan route continues straight through a narrow track in the hills, where Indian file is necessary. ° At 14 miles, the westerly track, above referred to, rejoins the road on the slope down to the small *arai and tea-house known as Chash Giran. There is a small qandt, with a pool for watering animals, about 60 yards S. of the track, in the ravine. h Road undulating, ascending slowly. At 15 mites the waggon road from E. rejoins just below a second tea-house, also known as Chash Giran. Here there is a large qandt, with a deep and spacious pool for watering animals, also the ruins of a former village or sarai, and an old brick kiln beside which there is good camping-ground. Supplies. —Ml. Livestock .—Two hundred sheep and goats. Ascent continues, becoming steeper; at 17 miles nice plot of cultivation with trees and large pond. The highest point is reached at 22 mites, where a few small juniper trees may be seen growing on the mountains towards the M Thence the road leads across a plain in a more easterly direction towards the sarai and post-house. There is also a partly-ruined sarai built entirely of stone. Ahuan is the highest point on the Meshed’ toad. Its altitude is 6,540 feet. Snow may be looked for from November to April. The district is also subject to a stronv and very cold wind in the winter months. Supplies.—Axe often inadequate for the ordinary traffic and occasionally the sarai has no tenant, and nothin^ at all is procurable. Livestock.—In Summer large flocks of sheep and goats graze in the vicinity. Water .—A very small stream from S. runs into a pond in front of the sarai. 1 There are two ponds at the back of the sarai on the slona towards the N. 1 G-razing. —Good. Fuel.

At 2 £ miles tiny stream and pool of water behind a tea-house at the foot of a low hill, on the top of which the road takes a more easterly direction. There is also a small stream and a pond on the other side of the hill. After this there is no more water near the road on this stage. Track lies between low hills and is undulating, until at 10 miles the hills are left behind, and the remainder of the stage is open plain, thickly covered with brushwood and wild almond. At 12 miles the village of Ab Kuri about 3 miles S. of the road, where water is procurable from a small qandt, and there is a utall or pond for watering animals. This is the only place where a camp is possible on this stage. There are 3 villages in a line with Ab*Kari. At 16 miles small tea-house by the road-side, for which water is brought from the village referred to. Long gentle descent to river-bed at 21 miles. Water is only found here immediately after rain. At 27^ miles, large stream of water from a qandt crosses the road from N. to S. A small enclosed village with avenue of trees about 1 ^ miles to N., and a new sarai and tea-house, with domed roof, by the roadside. This place is also the post-house. Gusheh has a small well-built sarai with an db-ambdr and two or three shops, and the old chapdrkhdneh opposite it. d he stream of water above-mentioned was opened up about (1904). By its means the land S. of the sarai is being rapidly brought into cultivation. J . Supplies.—Are now adequate for ordinary traffic and ar® increasing yearly.

Many walled gardens on both sides of the road, their chief produce being pistachio nuts. At 18 miles a line of qanats crosses the road ; water may be obtained by following up the slip away on the right. A gentle rise over soil, at first°soft and spongy, but after a mile gravelly and firm. The two old minar* of Damghan are now visible, and the town itself is sighted at 2 miles, whence the road descends gently. The best site for a camp is about one and a half miles from the town. Nearer the town the ground, though apparently suitable for a camp, is really a very extensive, ancient graveyard. On the right near to the entrance to the town there is a iiew mud-built sarai, then a shallow stream over which a bridge is thrown. A sharp turn to the left leads to the large brick sarai and a turn to the right leads through the bazar to the town. The ancient city of Damghan the birthplace of Fath ’All Shah, stands in the middle of the' modem town. It is now in ruins, possessing but 2 or 3 habitable houses. Its moat in wet weather fills with w ater. Supplies in harvest time are plentiful, but large quantities of grain are exported, leaving the town almost denuded. The surrounding district is very productive. Wheat, barley, lucerne, cotton and opium are grown.

Leaving Damghan by the only road, viz., that through the bazar, proceed along a wind ing lane through cultivated land, on which part of the ancient city of Dainghan once stood. Two loopholed mud towers guard the road here, and there are two others where the gates formerly stood in the line of the city walls. Water is allowed to overflow on to the road inside the walls, making it difficult for wheeled traffic. Outside the walls several small streams and much mud to be got over, until the torrent bed is reached at three-quarters of a niile. When in flood, the torrent is about fifty yards wide and it is sometimes strong enough to stop the traffic, but only for a few hours. At two miles higher ground is reached and going is easier. At two and a half miles a stream crosses the road with one tree beside it. There is now cultiva tion on both sides of the road. The village of Hajiabad on the N. is passed at 4 miles with tea house, db-ambar, and small garden by the road-side. At 6 miles pass through the ruins of village, the road making a curve to the S, After rain the ground here is very soft, and the over flow of the irrigation water increases the difficulty. At 8 miles, lines of qandts cross the road, and at 10 miles a hut by roadside on a line of qandts, Mihmandflst village is reached at 12 miles.

Epitome. General. This is the main route between Isfahan and Tehran. 13 a cart road always fit for heavy lorries except for short periods in winter after rain or snow. ^ The old chavar service between Isfahan and Qum has now for y post, and the riding horses have been aken off the road. The journey from Isfahan to Tehran can be performed m from 3^ to 4 days.64 Boute No. V— contd. Road. —The road can conveniently be divided into 3 sections ; (a) Isfahan to Kashan, stage 11. (b) Kashan to Qum, stage 16. (c) Qum to Tehran, stage 22. (&amp;) This section is identical with the old post road. The road is not made, but has been partially cleared of stones. It must be very heavy in parts after rain, especially in stage 13 where some shur is crossed, and in stages 11 and 12 , where heavy sand is met with in places. The .first 12 miles is good going, and lies over gravelly plain. The Persian Transport Company holds the concessions for a road from Isfahan to Qum embracing this section and the previous one. (c) is a made road, bridged throughout, and constructed under a concession to the Imperial Bank of Persia ; it was first opened to traffic in 1890 and has since been transferred to the Persian Transport Company, who now keep it up and collect tolls on it. The mails are carried in fourgons by private contract with the Post Office. The contractors also take passengers with the mails, and supply carriages for the journey. This is also the part of the post road from Kermanshah to Tehran. Supplies. —-At each of the stages there is a rest-house, where ordinary supplies for travellers can be obtained. Supplies scarce except at Natanz, Qum, and Kizarak. Water, —Good; and scarce at some stages in (a) and (fc). Grazing .-—Is scanty ; all the horses at the various stages were being fed on broken straw (locally kah). Camels would be able to find food as large numbers may be seen browsing in the neighbourhood of Kallabad and Muhammadieh. Fuel .—Very scarce apparently, for the inhabitants seem to use a large quantity of the small brushwood, which is plentiful, but almost useless as fuel owing to the rapidity with which it is burnt up ; beyond the few plane and poplar trees in the villages themselves there would appear to be no growth. Transport .—A few draught horses are kept at each stage. During the winter large numbers of camels may be obtained, of a very good stamp, short-legged and strong ; in the summer theRoute No. V—contd. caravan traffic is apparently carried on almost entirely on mules and camels cannot be obtained at all.

Kashan is a large irregularly built town with high walls of mud which are flanked by buttresses, generally in ruins. On the b. side these walls are surrounded by a ditch, and the whole is fa ling to pieces. The trade and manufactures are considerable consisting of carpets, copper utensils and silks, and the water- supply is good, being drawn from a few wells, and from three ! r ° m / in ~ a well - kn °™ garden and palace third f t . mile s-one from Nasrabad and the ird from the hil s Kashan contains a telegraph office, a large building ma walled garden outside the Darvazeh-i-Daulat, and several caravansarais.

The village walls are flanked by towers, and the houses are loopholed for musketry. These villages are built in an irrigated valley running N., 20° E. and S., 20° W., and bounded on the W. by a high and bold range of hills, running off into a more rounded and lower range towards the S. end of the valley. The latter is divided diagonally by a ndld, 20 feet or 30 feet wide, and difficult to cross, which irrigates the fields and supplies the villages with water.

Road passes along left margin of the lake, which is 7,000 feet above the sea, and such water as may remain in it or the stream is liable to be frozen. To the left at S miles the valley is closed by a dam, forming a fine sheet of water in the spring. If this band were to burst, Kashin and surrounding country would be inundated. Road enters and follows a ndld ; high mountains on the right, and a less elevated, flat-toppej ridge along which infantry might march o i the leffc. At 15 miles reach Gabarabad, a small caravansarai. The road is in places rocky, and runs along the left bank of a deep ravine to a small plateau, commanding the pass, on which the caravanserai is built. The water at the bottom of the ndld is good, but leaves a thick white deposit on the bank. _ The n descend gradually to Darreh -i-Duzdan pass and at 1 / miles pass a small fortified village at the exit: thence over bad, stony ground.

At 5 miles the track is joined by a road from Murtchekhur, Tarkh, and Kasheh. Further on the small village of Kaleh-i-Hamzeh lies to the E. of the road. At 7 miles one reaches the ruins of an old caravansarai, said to have been built by Shah ’Abbas, behind which a small stream runs its rapid course eastwards.

General .—The most important trade route in Persia. The road has been built by a Russian company with the financial support of the Russian Government In May 1912, the Russians employed a section of an auto mobile company, consisting of 4 motor lorries and one light car, from Enzell to Kazvin, in carrying supplies, ammunition, and78 Route No. VI — contd. passengers. The light ear was” driven also “from Kazvin to Tehran. Hoad .—The road is metalled throughout and bridged. Passability .—The road is passable throughout for Ford vans, A. T. carts, field guns, and L. A. M. cars provided that the Qafilan Kuh Pass (stage 18) can be negotiated. Loaded Ford vans require at least 30 men each to haul them over ; a L. A. M. bar for the northern slope required 50 men. A. T. carts with loads weighing 5 maunds or less could probably negotiate the pass with their normal two mules. Field guns would have to be double horsed. The surface over the Qafilan Kuh Pass is fairly even but the gradient is extremely steep with some difficult turns. The N. side is more difficult than the S. The section from the Qafilan Kuh Pass to Haji Agha (stage 22) is difficult but passable for all the above mentioned types of transport. In stage 23 the Shibli Pass is quite easy compared with the Qafilan Kuh Pass. The Zinjan Rud was fordable everywhere on 19th July 1918. In wet weather, stage 9 and stages 12 to 17 inclusive, may be impassable. As far as Zinjan the surface of the road is usually hard and level except when leading between cultivation, and for a few dips into nullahs in stages 9 and 13. The gradients are usually easy. As far as Gajin (stage 22, mile 7), the road has a river running parallel to it on the southern side, usually about mile distant. Owing to the stiffness of the hills and large stretches of stony surface between stage 17 and stage 24 particular attention should be paid to spare parts, especially to spare clutch bands and tubes. At mile 6 , mile 10, and mile 11 in stage 9, mile 8 , stage 10, mile 4J, stage 12 there is a choice of roads ; that is, the road forks and rejoins later on. In each case the northerly branch should be taken by wheeled transport. At mile 4f, stage 10 all arms should follow the N. branch. From Karveh (stage 9, mile 17J) to Zinjan (stage 13, mile 16) a parallel road runs on the S. side of the river. Water .—Good and plentiful throughout the route. It is conveniently situated for troops on the march. Supplies .—At stages marked P. H. there is a post-house, where accommodation for travellers and meagre supplies—79 Route No, Yl—contd. usually only fowls, eggs, etc.—are procurable. The post-houses are substantially built of burnt brick, and have good rooms, partially furnished, and a patch of garden in front. The other stages are merely places for changing horses. From Tehran to Kazvln ( 6 ), although there is but little to be obtained at the post- houses,the road traverses a rich plain, producing wheat and ariey, and containing many villages. A large force would have to make previous arrangements for supplies throughout this toute. Good and plentiful except at the following places :— ( 1 ) Amirdbdd. Stage 11 , mile 15.

Tactical. —The road from Zinjan (stage 13, mile 16) to Mianeh (stage 18, mile 15) is hidden by the higher ground at the sides of the valley. Thus enemy troops could get on to the road without being seen. The top of the mountain above Kara Tappeh (5 miles S. of Zinjan), overlooks the whole of the plain and would make an excellent observation post. The peak of the hills W. of Zinjan (elevation 8,000 feet) is also an exceedingly valuable observation post and topographical point for the valley from the Zinjan Pud and Kizil Uzun as far as Qafilan Ktih. The top of the Qafilan Kuh would make an excellent obser vation post. From Yangija (stage 14, mile 14) to Kikbeh (stage 15, mile 9) the nature of the ground would easily allow the construction of defences against enemy forces moving in the direction of Zinjan (stage 13, mile 16). Alternative Stage. There is an alternative stage between Mianeh (stasre 18, mile 15) and Suma (stage 19, mile 18) which goes via Aunlik, distance 24 miles. The stage is passable for Ford vans, A. T. carts, and field guns with difficulty, and in some places with extraordinary difficulty.82 Route No. VI — contd. 5 KAVANDEH (P.H.) 15} m. General direction N.-W.

The road branches W. by S. from84 Route No. VI — contd. S. side, with some of its gardens to the N. At mile 8 the road turns sharply to the N. for a better crossing of a dry stony ndld. (A branch goes straight on across a stream and the ndld.) Wheeled transport should take the N. road. The two roads rejoin at mile 9 at the village of Chinad (population 1,000). A track direct to KazvTn through a pass in the low hills to the N.-E. joins the road at the stony nullah. A branch of this track crosses the road earlier to Aznau. At mile 11 Abhar (population 4,000) is left 1| miles to the S. of the road. This is a large village with a bazar and blue domed masjid. A track leads W.-S.-W. from Abhar over the hills which are some 5 miles S. of the road. The hills to the N. are some 6 miles away. There are small hamlets among the foothills to the N. At mile 15J Khurram Darreh (population 1,500) is reached. It adjoins the S. side of the road. At Abhar river comes close in to the road and is dammed above the village. The river banks are very thickly treed with poplars, sufficient for extensive bridging or building. Water .—Everywhere along the route from irrigation channels.

At mile 3 the road crosses a dry nullah. The read then goes N.-N.-W. to Nas rabad, mile 5, a small village (population 100) on the road itself in the desert. The road continues in a N.-N.- w. direction to a coffee house (mile 8 ) on the N. of the road, and the large village of Sain Kaleh, J mile to the S. of the road, the gardens of which extend to the road. Here the road fromRoute No. VI- contd. Ziabad (stage 1 , mile 11 ) joins in, while a branch of it still con- tmues along the S. bank of the Abhar river passing J mile S. of Am; ra bad at mile 15. There is also a short cut which follows the telegraph line from Haiyeh to Sain Kaleh coffeehouse. At mile 8 the road crosses a dry nullah. The country after mile 8 becomes less cultivated. From mile 8 to mile 15 the road runs A.-W . passing Pisadktr and a well-wooded garden 1 mile to the b. and a swamp J mile square on the S. of the road. At mile 11 the road crosses another dry nullah.

The road over the plain would probably be impassable in wet weather. At mile 3 a deep g-anai is crossed by a stone culvert brido-e 12 teet wide and 14 feet long, very strongly built up. The bridge is passable for the heaviest motors. At mile 4|, on reach ing the top of a slight rise, the road is seen to fork, the S. branch ' xrt j i ani ^ h ’ whi ch is conspicuous by its blue dome of Shah Khudaband. This track, which is followed by the tele graph line and is liable to be mistaken for the main road, is not passable for wheeled transport, and all arms should take the N branch which is the main road to Zinjan. On the S. bracnh after86 Route No. \l-~contd. crossing seven very badly bridged irrigation cuts, Husainabad is passed at mile 5|-; Sultanieh (population about 1,500) is situated at mile 8 , on the N. side of a marsh 60 feet wide, which is crossed by a very narrow uneven stone causeway. ,, s ^PP lies are fairly plentiful. At Sultanieh the road along the S. bank of the Abhar river joins the southern track. On leaving Sultanieh, the road continues and the S. branch of the mam road goes off in the direction of Kalla. The track becomes much worse as it leads on to Kalla, a small village at mile 9. A track from Kalla,_ recognisable by a mound on the N.-E. side, leads across the plain and swamp to Kara Bulaq at mile ISA. ihe N. branch or mam road passes Similvar, a small village N. of the road.

Zinjan (population 24,000) has a post house, cara- vunsarai and ludo-Turopean telegraph office. It is the centre of a productive district. The town is built on high ground and is surrounded by gardens. It is shut in by high hills on the E. and W. between which lies a plain, 6 miles long, watered by the river, which has gardens on both banks. The snow falls very heavily at Zinjan. Water .—Very plentiful everywhere. Supplies. Should be plentiful for a small force after the harvest, and fruit very plentiful. Fuel .—Trees along the Zinjan Rud.

The road is 208J m. in very good condition and is passable for L. A. M. cars. Ford vans, A. T. carts, and field guns. In wet w'eather the road will be impassable. The road follows the valley of the Zinjan Rud and is good to mile 5 except for one place (mile 24) where the road passes over a ledge about 20 feet above the river bed with only just enough room for a car to pass. At mile 5 is the very small village of Kushgan (50 houses). There is good grazing here and also river water, A large area is under cultivation,—barley and wheat (3-6-18). There are many trees. At mile 54 fnd mile 7 -|- river runs close below the road as before. These places need revetting as the road suiface is being eaten away by the erosion of the river. Repairs could easily be effected and were urgently needed in August 1918. At mile 84 is the village of Nazlmabad (15 houses). Good grazing can to obtained. There is a tea-house on the road side. The road is good to Yangija. At mile Hi Chivad village is passed 1| mile to the S. of the road. It appears to have good cultivation. At mile 12 the Shirimsagli river is crossed. It is 15 feet wide, 2 feet deep with a stony bottom difficult for cars. After crossing the river there are Ivo steep gradients of 1 in 25. To the N. is undulating country with90 Supplies. —Bread (small quantities), meat and bhoosa. Crops of rice, wheat, barley and lucerne stretch over many acres along the river. The harvest here normally commences about the end of June. -F'weZ.—Plentiful. Grazing.—Good at Aghamazar, and a little at Tazehkand (mile 15). Camping ground. —N. W. of village. 17 JAMALABAD .. 12 m. General direction N. The road is in very good 255J m. condition and passable for L. A. M. cars, Ford vans, A. T. carts, and field guns. In wet weather the road will be impassable. The best place for cars to operate between Zinjan and Jama’abad would be in this stage as they could leave the road and operate to a depth of two to three miles on either side of the road. The road keeps near the river to mile 1 and then bears away from it, the river going westward. The road is undulating and is intersected by numerous dry river beds leading S. of the Kizil Uzun Chai. At mile 3 there is an up gradient of 1 in 7 for 50 yards. There is no water en route until a spring is reached at Nauruzabad (mile 7J). At Nauruzabad (20 houses) meat can be obtained but no grazing. There is a caravansarai and also a good enclosed camping ground. The road descends at mile 11 for 100 yards, gradient 1 in 8 . Jamalabad (50 houses) is reached at mile 12 . It is a suitable halting place and a good place for replenishing supplies. There is a caravansarai. Gardens stretch along the river bank. IF ater. —Good water from spring and wells. Supplies. —Good crops. Small amount of bread, meat, hay and bhoosa. Fuel. —Plentiful. Grazing. —Good. Camping ground. —There is a good camping ground N. of the village. 18 MIANEH (Mir ANU) 15 m. General direction N.- W. 2701- m. The road is passable for A. T. carts and field guns but owing to the steep gradients on the road, A. T. carts should only carry half loads and field guns would require spare teams to assist at these places. 1 ord vans and L. A. M. cars cannot possiblyRoute No. Yl—contd. get up the steep ascents under their own power and unless their brakes were m the best of order it would be extremely dangerous foi them to attempt the descents. Before reaching the Qafilan KQh Pass there are 3 bad gra dients, namely:— ° ( 1 ) Immediately after leaving Jamalabad there is a very s.eep descent for about 150 yards which only a loaded Ford van in reahy good order could climb. ( 2 ) and (3) There are two similar but more difficult gradients at the Katuruchhan pass about mile 2 . The road over this pass goes straight up and straight down the ridge without any attempt at any grading. J 1 The Qafilan Kuh Pass has 7 very steep gradients, 2 on the JN. side and 5 on the S. side varying from 1 in 7 or 8 to 1 in 18 or 20. The X. side is the steeper and drops more quickly. Ad these places are very serious obstacles to motor traffic and cannot be negotiated by cars unless they are hauled up by men or animals. Loaded Ford vans and L. A. M. cars have to be kern T 8 1 50 men respectively. On October 29th, IdlJ, a fully loaded Ford tourer was hauled over by 3 bullocks. xhe Qafila i Kuh Pass is said to have been negotiated with out, hauling by Crossley tenders. The pass is reported to be open to wheeled traffic throughout tneyear even when the snowfalls, as the snow does not lie long. I tie road is difficult to negotiate during the rainy season in the early spring. The road could be graded so as to make it passable for motors running under their own power. The road suface to mile 5 is gravelly and good, except for the 3 gradients mentioned above At mile J there is a culvert winch has been repaired, at the bottom of gradient m mention ed above. At mile 1 the ascent of the Katurchhan Pass com- mences with a gradient of about 1 in 10 or 12 , for 200 yards, followed by a descent [gradient (3) above] to mile 2i; the gra dient near the top being 1 in 12 to 15. m .*l e t ! 3e .

This river92 Route No. VI. — contd. ■was fordable on 15-6-18 and has a stony bottom. At mile 5 it is crossed by a 3-arch bridge, which is built of brick with a stone base to each pier. The roadway has a cambered surface, 30 feet wide and is paved Avith stone. The arches are 40 feet long by 50 feet high except the centre one, which is 60 feet high. Both piers jut out 10 feet beyond the level of the bridge, and are hollowed out to form two small arches. The thickness of the piers is 15 feet. The parapet is 1 foot 6 inches high. AH cars should water up at the bridge. After crossing the bridge, the road winds uphill to mile 8 . Rests for cars are being cut in the side ; 30 men per car and ropes are required. The gradients are steep at mile 7. After mile 8 the road leads doAvn the N. side o f the Qafilan Kuh Pass with steep gradients and two or three hair pin bends. Great care should be exercised in the descent. The surface is fair. The slope is 1 in 5 in three places. There is a sanjfarash, or causeAvay over the highest part of the pass, which, however, has apparently not been used for many years. The road is bordered on either side by high mountains. At mile 10 the surface of the road becomes level. At mile 12 the Karangu Ohai is crossed by a 23-arch brick bridge Avith square stone piers. The bridge is 300 yards long, Avith a roadway 30 feet wide paved with stones. The parapet is tAVo feet high. The arches are approximately the same size, 21 feet long and 18 feet high, the piers being 12 feet thick. The river channel is 40 yards across and has a stony bottom and is fordable (15-6-18). From mile 12 , the road in places is muddy on account of some small streams and irrigation channels. It needs repair to make a good motor road. Trees and cultivation border the S. side of the road. At mile 15 Mlaneh (population 1,000) is reached. Tnere are 50 shops in the bazaar. M'aneh has tAvo caravanrarais and also a telegraph office of the Indo-European telegraph line.

Except for the passage of the river bed at mile 2 £ the road is passable for armoured cars and Ford vans although both would need pushing twice between mile 10 and mile 18 and at Suma, mile 18. The road follows the telegraph line and to mile 2 is good through extensive cultivation. At mile 2 the road divides into a track for mules ana aroad for cars.the latter travelling due W. to mile 2£ to the bed of the Mianeh Chai, the former following the telegraph line, joining the river bed at mile 3|. An alternative road detailed ater to Suma, urn Aunlik, fit, but difficult, for Ford vans, leaves the mam road at mile 2 and goes in a N.-W. direction. The main road winds along the river bed to mile 10 where a Persian Guard House is reached. The road crosses and recrosses the Mianeh Chai many times. The stream is 20 yards wide and is muddy. It was fordable by all vehicles on 1-7-18 The bed of the stream is 100 yards to 300 yards wide and ‘stony. It is enclosed on both sides by high ground 30 feet to 100 feet above the surface of the bed. There is some cultivation on both banks A party travelling up the bed would not be visible from the surrounding country. The village of Karakul is passed to the FT. of the road at mile 8 . This village lies J mile off the road up a stream bed. There are trees, cultivation, stream water ana good grazing. There is a guard house at mile 91 Here the road makes a detour to the N. side of the mule track which leads N.-W. over a steep hill impassable for carts. The cart road travels up a dry stream bed. At mile 10 the village of Akchah Qishlaq (60 houses) is passed. The village is °now deserted (1-7-18) and is only occupied in winter. There is no water. At mile 11 the cart road and mule track rejoin. The road surface is undulating, the valleys being | mile to 1 mile apart. At mile 12 there is an awkward descent for 300 yards. It is reported that it is possible to avoid this by following the river bed due W. from the guard house (mile 9 |), rejoining the mam road near a ruined rest house at mile 13. At mile 13 there is another awkward descent for 150 yards with difficult turns into a stream bed. At mile 17J there is a similar descent At mile 18 the village of Suma (150 houses) is mile to the E. of the94 Route No. VI— contd. road.

T. carts, and field guns with difficulty. Several bridges over small irrigation channels require repairing before heavy cars can cross. Great care should be taken in crossing what appear to be hard bottomed irrigation channels, as an empty Talbot lorry was bogged for a considerable time (7-9-18). There is a difficult valley at Khojah Gayas, mile 3. The road here descends sharply through the village and then goes up the W. side of the valley over a stony ascent of 1 in 6 for 200 yards. A new road could be made with winding gradients up the hill side (50 men in 3 days) Khojah Gayas (200 houses) has three caravansarais. There are trees and extensive cultivation along the valley, a good stream and spring water. A track goes off from here to Maragheh via Dugan and Dukhargan. The bridge, before entering Turko- mancbai, needs repairing. At mile 6 is the village of Turkoman- chaT (250 houses). There is good stream and spring water. Turkomanchai could support one battalion of infantry and regi ment of cavalry for two weeks (15-6-18). The country near Turkomanchai and along the valley is fertile ; wheat and barley are grown. From mile 6 two roads lead up the W. side of Turkomanchai valley, joining at mile 6 |. The S. road is the better. A difficult stream bed is crossed 200 yards N.-W. of Turkomanchai. At mile 8 there is a muddy passage needing ten 12 foot planks to build up a culvert for armoured cars to pass without difficulty. At mile 9^ the village of Gharib Dust (150 houses) is passed \ mile N. of the road. Water. —Four springs, also very good water from stream. Supplies. —Extensive cultivation.

One of the steepest hills out of the river is here met with. The gradient in some places is about one in 4 or 5. A considerable number of natives will be required to take up heavy cars. At mile 2 , the road is liable to be muddy and requires revetting. From here to Gajin the road is very hilly but the surface is very good and cars can climb the hills with a little assistance. At mile 7 the village of 0ajin (70 houses) lies f mile N. of the road. It has a post house. Here is water from a stream. Supplies are small until the harvest and fuel is scarce. At Ga jin there is a sharp hill with a loose stony surface which needs clearing and which would take 50 men 2 or 3 hours. The road into HajI Agha is covered with loose stones. This also needs clearing. Hap Agha (mile 2 2 1-) is a large village situated in a fine plain. There is a post house. Wafer .—Plentiful from stream (2-7-18).

This stage was traversed by an armoured car on 6-7-18. From mile 0, the road is practically level as far as the Shibll Pass, mile 8 , but it is covered with loose stones which could be easily removed. The Shibli Pass as compared with the Qafilan Kuh Pass (stage 18, mile 9) is exceptionally good, and the ascent and descent were made at night without lights (6-7-18). One or two alterations are necessary, particularlj’on the Tabriz side where it is necessary to cut three rests to render the ascent easy. Shibll village is passed on the N. side of the pass at mile 12 . From here to the village of Kizilja Maidan, mile 14, the road is covered with loose stones and needs clearing, otherwise it is quite good. From Kizilja Maidan to Basminj the road continues to be very stony and the country becomes rolling hills again. Basminj, mile 18, and Naaratabad, mile 19f, are practically the same village, adjoining one another the road going through both.

Good load over 3o5| m. plain. Road first leads west-ward through outskirts of town to the Aji Chai river,'which is crossed by a fine, old brick bridge of 16 arches. The Russians in 1905, instead of building a new bridge over Aji Chai, made alterations to the old one to adapt it to proposed motor car service. A road_branches off here N.-N.-E. to Kara DSgh. Thence across the Aji Chai plain N.-W., skirting the low hills which lie back on the right hand side, 2 or 3 miles distant. On the left is a broad and well-cultivated plain dotted with villages extending to Lake Urumieh. At 11| miles cross small stream, spanned formerly by a stone bridge now fallen into disuse. Crossing easjn except at times of flood. Breadth of water-20 feet; depth 1 foot in November. A small guard of horsemen is maintained here. Sahalan is surrounded by cultivation. 28 SUElAN .. .. II m. Ger.eral direction N.- — W. Road continues 396f m. over flat country, prac tically level, the rise being inappreciable. Sufian is a small village of 400 houses with many large gardens. It is watered by the Si a van river, an uncertain and brackish source of supply. Picot gives Tabriz to Sudan as one stage, but it is 20 miles long. 27 MARAND .. .. 17 m. General directionN,- (SjOoO'). W. Road begins a 4l3f m. long rise over good ground to the plateau lying off the Mashu Dagh and the Kara Dagh. Leaving Sufian the caravan road follows the line of the Siavan river in a N.-W. direction for 4 miles, rising gradually by an open valley, enclosed by rounded,, clay ridges, to the Siavan pasturages. Here road bifurcates, one branch going to the N.-W., the other bending W. ; the latter is the easier and that taken by caravans. The former is more direct and along it the Indo- European telegraph is laid. Caravan route continues by the Siavan pasturage, and then rises gradually to the plateau, en closed by massive peaks of the Mashu Dagh on the W., by lower hills on the E. At 10 miles pass a fine, old, ruined caravansarai cm; sb ' ' : H98 Route No. VI— conic?. Bnd the village of Yam, 30 houses. Shortly after, the watershed is crossed at an elevation of 5,350 feet. Thence the descent is fairly easy to Marand, 16 miles. Road passes throughout over sand and shingle, and is fit for wheeled traffic in fine weather. Marand is a small town with a fair ba~ar. Roughly 3,000 houses. Rich gardens and plantations; surrounding plain well cultivated. Village occupies an important position in angle formed by the Mashu Dagh and Kara Dagh ranges, but is commanded by hills on every side. Marand is the seat of the Governor. 28 ZAL or AIRANDIBIL 23 m. General direction N.-W. Enter on 436§ m. (1006) completed por tion of the Russian concession road. Road curves to mountain on E. At 4£ miles cross the Zilbir Chal. River general^ ilows between steep bants about 50 yards in breadth. In November it held about 10 feet of water, a few inches in depth. Pass through the upper valley of Zilbir Chai, and emerge at 8 J miles abreast of Akuvna village. Road now inclines westward away from the mountains. Here enter a rich and well-cultivated plateau, 3 to 6 miles in breadth and evtending to Zal. It is enclosed by the high mountains of Kara Dagh on the E., on the W. by fife easy sloping clay hills which divide it from the valley of the Zilbir Chal. The caravan road keeps to the western, the telegraph and carrying road to the eastern and longer part of the valley. At 10 J miles cross the Zunus Chai. At 11J miles cross the Kina Tepu, a mountain stream. At I2f miles the caravan road is joined by the telegraph and carriage road. At 17 miles a ruined ':araramarat of Shah 'Abbas is passed. At 18|- miles the large village of Zunus, S.-E,. high up on the hillside, 1,000 houses. The Zunus Chai takes its rise here. At 21 £ miles the village of Kara BHacf 50 houses, E.-S.-E.; Harzan, 200 houses E. ; Galangaia, S. Zal village lies 1 mile off the road to W. Supplies fairly plentiful. This is generally made the hailing place for caravans. Another account gives distance from Marand to Zal as 19 miles-, and Zal to Julfa as 25 miles. Airan- dibil is described as an immense collection of hovels. 29 J-TIiFA .. .. 1 J 5 m. General direction N. (2 &gt; 65C A ) At 2 fi miles leave the Zal plateau, which has 4512 m.100 /Route No. VI— contd. from tile right to the left bank. Wooden stages of a temporary nature exist at either end of the hawsers. A steep ramp on the Russian side gives access to the landing stage. Three fords exist above ami below the ferry. One is at the first bend | miles below the ferry. Access from both banks easy. Ford, 100 yards broad ; length up and down, 100 yards, depth 3 feet ; bottom firm, of sand and shingle, giving an excellent passage; open during the summer and early autumn, difficult and danger ous at other times. This ford is well known and is marked by a number of heavy mill stones obtained from a quarry in the nemhboprhood. The second is about 150 yards below the ferry. River banks slope easily ; good, sandy bottom, depth about 3 to 3 £ feet; open summer and autumn, when it is used f or camel transport; dangerous at other times. The third ford is at the village of Julfa, about 31 miles above the ferry, at a point where the river divides into three channels. The crossing is exceptionally easy, and is closed only during spring floo&amp;s and winter freshets. The Russians have built a bridge across the Aras river, fit to take a railway, and have (1912) connected the station at Julia (Russian) with this bridge by earthworks, for the railway to Tabriz. The soil is impregnated with saline matter, and no village has sprung up, the nearest being old Julfa mentioned above. There are customs houses, a good rest-house and sarai on the Persian bank, and two telegraph offices, one of the Persian Government, and one, transmitting, of the Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Company. Cossack sentries are posted over all the fords, and a passport is necessary when crossing the fron tier. The road onwards on the Russian side is an excellent one, with a carriage service to Erivan. The Russian Railway to Erivan was opened in December 1902, and the Erivan-Julfa section was opened to traffic in August 1905. Tabriz is uow connected by rail with Tiflis. N. B .—There is a route along the river bank, from .Tulfa to ’Arab vid Kizil Vang. To Kizil Vang it is impossible, except for horsemen, and is at all tiipes uncertain owing to the dangers of slips caused by the heavy rain, or the Veai'ng ^u-ay oi the bank at the foot of the cliffs. From Kizii Vang westwards to Aiab it lies across a plain, and is generally open and easy.102 Route No. VI— contd. Safar Khwaja, is a sihall village ; water plentiful. There is said to be a shorter and more difficult road between these places. 4 HUS AIN AB AD .. 19 m. Road is good over the sandy plains, on 53 which are scattered some mud villages and mounds.

From MIANEH to SUMA via AUNLIK. Distance 24 miles. 1 stage. The road is passable for Ford vans, A. T. carts, and field guns with difficulty and in some places with extraordinary difficulty. Water is scarce on the first run from Mlaneh to Aunlik. The prevailing wind is a following one. Cars will require a good deal of water for filling up radiators. The return journey is not.so .difficult, as. it is possible to accelerate on the descending grades. The road leaves the main road at stage 11, mile 2 , and goes in N.-N.-W. direction over undulating country. At mile 5 a deviation is made, which at the moment is sandy (7-9-18) but preferable to the old road. At mile 7 and mile 8 , respectively, there are two difficult valleys, the gradients of which could easily be improved by making a detour of4 mile. At mile 9 a deviation is made where the cars will require assist ance up the hill to the- village of Aunlik. Water should be takenRoute No. VI~contd. at this viiia^a At mile 10, the village of Aunhk (100 houses) is passed. It is surrounded by good gardens with apricot trees! The harvest is now m progress (1-7-18). Water, 3 days a week, flows through the village. On the other days it is brought from the Ur Chai, 1 mile to the N. of the village. Grazing is good. The road on leaving Aunlik turns W. by S. ; it winds as it passes over some hills. The surface is good until the river bed at Birin] is reached. There are several awkward turns with a narrow passage way. At mile 13 is the village of Birini (50 houses) on the river Bulandarik. Native assistance is required pi !'. 1 , t ie J;, arS t irough the villa ge which is built on the slope ot a hill. The general direction of the road becomes W. and is undulating. Cars need pushing. At Suma, mile 24, the road rejoins the mam road. Note on stages Tabriz to Gajin (24-22) at the beginning of March 1919. ■ i On March 1 st— 8 th a four-horsed, four-wheeled cart got through from Mianeh to Tabriz with great difficulty. For per- hianent Ford car traffic about one month’s work by 500 men could make a fairly good road for the summer and autumn (Mav- JNovember): after this the surface is too muddy for permanent traffic .hough a single car could always be got through except m February and March. Drinking JfM/er.—Plentiful and good now throughout the route except at Yusufabad, where the supply is from wells. Water always drinkable. Sufficient for 400 men and 300 ani- Camping Ground .—-From December to March most of the ground (owing to the latitude and altitude) is under snow. rorn April to November, however, camping grounds are to be round almost anywhere. Climate.—-Know and wind from December to March. In March and April the road begins to dry, and April— November the climate is temperate.I 106 Route No. VI — contd. Vf ; From TABRIZ to KIZILJl MAIDAN. See main report. Road on this date was worse owing to heavy fall of snow for two days. This made the descent into the valley of the Barash Chal slippery and awkward : Ford cars here would need skid chains and also would have to be pushed (if coming up the hill towards Tabriz). Otherwise surface held well after the snow. In the Basminj bazaar a mixture of mud, slush and snow was in places 2 feet deep. This section for | mile through, and in the neighbourhood of Basminj, is badly in need of re-metalling. From KIZILJA MAIDAN to IIAjI AGHA. See main report. Ao^.—Inhabitants say there is another road from Kizilja Maidan to Yusufabai which avoids the Shibli Pass: it leaves the main road at or near the Post House called Saidabad or Gadaingya and goes S. of the main road passing through a village called Kandor ; detour is longer but gradient easier than those of the Shiblx Pass. Road leads up pass, being very muddy and thick with mixed slime and snow at the start. For Shibli Pass see main report. Ford cars going to Mlaneh could get up the pass with a fatigue party of 10 men (obtainable from Shibli village) to push each car. Fhe surface of the E. side of the pass is now passable for Ford oars but appears lixely to be eaten away by the erosion of the deep stream which flows S. of the road’s course. Pass Gurugel Lake, 200 yards N. of road. Lake is 800 yards across and now covered with snow and thin ice ; will not support any traffic. Road then leads through well-defined valley: surface snow-covered for iirst 4 miles : then for last 4 miles very muddy, with thick clinging surface, making marching fo ' infantry very slow and difficult. A F'ord van could get through but at an average of two miles per hour, halts being continually made to scrape off the mud.

( 1 ) Taking the left road, make a circular detour crossing a river (one of the tribu taries of the Uzun Chai). Ford is one foot deep and 15 yards wide: approaches muddy but bottom pebbly and firm. Road here is muddy and passable for Ford vans with great difficulty. Road in Karazakhun village is muddy and narrow : just wide enough for one Ford to pass. _ (2) Taking the direct road surface is fair ‘ V ° Ashrafabad and E. of it: here is a grassy swamp difficult from December to April. From April to December this route is passable for Ford vans with ease. From Karazakhun branch road leads S. skirting side of a biH .- then rejoins main road and telegraph wires. From here to Iikmadash road is passable for all traffic with great difficulty owing to the sticky and clinging mud. From April to Decem ber the road is good and passable for all arms: the rest of the year surface is always muddy. A Ford could get through with constant pushing and cleaning at an average rate of 2 miles per hour, counting stops. In the vicinity of the road large quantities of lucerne are grown in the ffin-mg and cut m September. Ground is very fertile and its wheat and barley crops noted. From TIKMADASH to GATIN'. First rejoin main road from village : then general direction v\ •-fe.-W. : surface of road so sticky and muddy as to be nearly impassable for all transport. Mules made 2 miles per hour through it: now impassable for Ford vans. Surface is now however at its worst and from April onwards becomes passable for armoured cars and Ford vans. General direction W.-S.-W. : road leads over a series of undulations varying from 1 to 2 miles across : at the bottom of 18 a Jr a ,w° d Stream flowin S S - into th e M'aneh Chai Jey. After that going is on snow at present and better: otherwise as before very sticky, thick and slippery. Road bifurcates, the Gajm branch leading A. of main road.108 ROUTE NO. VII. Feom TEHRAN to HAMAD AN. Distance 204\ miles. 13 stages. Authorities and dates .—Captain Trott, December 1918 j annotated by Captain Fortescie, 1921. Epitome. 1. General .—General direction W.-S.-W. The road is pass able for Army Transport carts and field guns during the dry season. Carts require to be manhandled. At mile 5 and mile 9 in stage 10, 60 pounder and heavier guns could only be got along with difficulty, and would probably take longer than by the Kazvln road. The road is not passable for Ford van convoys, though it could be made so without difficulty. A single Ford van carrying four ten-foot beams could negotiate the road with careful driving. The only steep gradient is in stage 9 at mile 5 , and this could be avoided by making a detour {vide detailed report), and there is no pass of any considerable height on the road. The country beyond Nubaran, stage 7 , however, is elevated and during severe winters {e.q., 1920-21) is under deep snow from December to March. In spring during the thaw this part of the route is quite impassable for wheels and only passable for pack animals with difficulty, as the ground all be- comes waterlogged and so% and several floodbeds, notably the Kudknaneh-i-Shur the principal obstacles passed—are with out bridges In wet weather also the alluvial plains between lehran and Robat Karin, stages 1-2, around Faizabad in Zarand, stage 3, and between Zarraq (or Zarreh) and Girkhlar, stages 10 and 11 , become very muddy and these portions would require metalling before the road would be fit for constant motor or wheeled traffic. . This is th e dire t cross country route from Tehran to Hamad an, is shorter than the main metalled road via Kazvin, and is considerably used by camel convoys especially in dry weather. In s «mmer their route is approximately the same as that taken by the iersian Telegraph Administration’s telegraph line fromRoute No. \H~contd. wLt' h tv®;”fCe*°3?fb“f »*«• *)• I' SvefTtat^ t r-T' aDd U, p' ’ ^ ges 4 ^ Asiabegto Nubaran, are said to be imrass quently treated ^ Sea£ ° n&gt; and the detour b y Saveh is conse- quently treated as the mam route. Wheeled traffic from Tehran to Hamadan always travels via azvm, but the Persian postal service of fourgons from Tehran to Qum owing to some dispute with Messrs.

Saveh, lying in a fertile will- watered plain, is the principal town on the road. It has110 Route No. VII — contd. large stock of grain, grass, straw, vegetables, fruit, cattle and sheep. The valley of the Mazdakan Chai in stage 6 is fertile, and Nubaran (stage 7) is a large place and produces supplies of all kinds. Beyond Nubaran in stages 8 and 9 (Dukhan and Dah Davan) supplies are scanty as far as stages 10-11, where villages are numerous in a rich alluvial plain. 4. Transport. —The Baghdadi Shahsavan tribe near Saveh, stage 4, own great numbers of camels, and at Saveh about 100 mules and 300 donkeys also could be obtained at any time. A few camels and mules may occasionally be hired at Nubaran (stage 7). 5. Fuel. —Wood is only available from artificial plantations of poplars and fruit trees around villages and is consequently rather scarce. The stock of dry wood is small in most villages. At Dukhan, stage 8 , and Dah Davan, stage 9, very few or no trees are grown. Dried dung is used in some villages to eke out the supply of wood. 6 . Grazing. —Nil for horses except a little at Robat Kar'm, stage 2 , and at Nubaran, stage 6 , in spring. It is plentiful for camels at all stages except 1 {vide detailed report). 7. Obstacles. — (a) The R'ldkhaneh-i-Shur (or Rud-i-SIr'r) in stage 3 , which was fordable easily in December 1916 and without much difficulty at the end of February 1921, becomes impassable for carts in March and April, but animals, especially camels, can usually cross. The bed is firm and consists of stones and gravel. The main channel in December 1918 was 10 yards wide and 2' deep. &lt;&amp;) In stage 9 at mile 5 there is an ascent of 1 in 10 for 200 yards, where carts have to be unloaded and man handled and again at mile 9 j up another incline of 1 in 5 for 30 yards. (c) Sections of the route difficult in winter or wet weather are mentioned in 1 , general, above. The worst sec tion for snow is Nubaran (stage 7) to Dah Davan (stage 9) but snow lies all the way to Ramadan. At end of February 1921 there was a path about 12 ' wide of snow trodden fairly hard by pack animals with several feet of soft snow on either side. In parts where112 Route No.. VII—cowfoZ.

The Baghdadi Shahsavan tribe (Turk!) migrate to the hills between Saveh and Hamadan in summer and occasionally pilfer from convoys. In 1920 gendarmerie posts were established along the road. The most influential people are Haji Salar-i-Shuja’, of the Baghdadi tribe, who lives near Saveh, and Amir Nasir. head of the c ans of Khalaj, who owns houses at Chamaum [see Alter native Stage 2 ] and Saveh, but usually resides in Tehran. 11 . Climate. —Stages 1 to 4, Tehran to Saveh, are hot and glaring in summer and water is scarce, but pleasant in winter. Stages 7 to 13, Nubaran to Hamadan, are severe in winter but temperate in summer. Robat Karim, stage 2, is said to be malarial in summer. 12 . Alternative Routes.—From Saveh (stage 4) via Sultanabad to Hamadan. This is longer than via Nubaran, but a good road and less likely to be blocked by snow in winter. It is reported to be fit for carts all the way, and for motors from Sultanabad. 13.

Formerly a fort, it is now ruined and deserted. The walls, 25 feet high, are of stone and loopholed The size of sarai is 90 yards square. No water is available. Three miles i s a small winter village of about seven houses. I he country here has a bad reputation for robbers but in there was a gendarme post. The road now bears S.-W by W., des cending gently for one mile to bed of the Rud-i-Shur Several parts of the road are uneven and difficult for carts. Cross the Rud-i-Shur, which was swift but easily fordable m December 1918. The'bottom is stony. The main channel was 10 yards wide and 2 feet deep. It is said to be impassable in wet weather and is full of snow water at end of February and early March. At this season the mails are carried over on horseback or camel and transferred to another postal cart, which meets them on the opposite bank. The water is always salty, and unfit even for animals On the W. side of river is a small tea-shop, the water for which is brought from Robat Karim. There is unlimited space for camping ground. The main river bed is about 1,100 yards wide between sandhills. Thence road ascends to plain. From mile 9|- barren desert stretches till mile 13J, where the remains of a square fort stand. No water is available. Continue over undulating desert plateau of stone and gravel, wtr'ch can be crossed by camels in every direction. At mile 17£ the road forks, and the road to Asia beg continues beside the telegraph wires', see Alternative Stage 1. The main route inclfnes to the left and crosses a ridge overlooking the dreary basin of Zarand, with numerous lines of qanats leading to the villages, which only cover a small part of its area. The rest is treeless and uncultivated. The summer heat is great and water is all more or less brackish. Pik is the nearest village, and a fair size, but is situated a mile or two away to the left of the direct road. It is the first village passed since leaving Robat Karim. Robat Karim to Saveh, 54 miles, can be done in two days by mounted men but infantry can halt at Pik, leaving a short second stage, about 7| miles to Faizabad, but a long third stage118 Route No. VII— contd. large caravdnsarais. There are many tanks' for storage of water in summer. The supply is from numerous qanctts and from canals off the Mazdakan Chai, which flows E of the town. The- former are perennial, but during summer the river water only belongs to Saveh for 5 days out of 15, and duriiig the remaining 10 days it is diverted for irrigation by villages upstream and little or no water reaches Saveh. Supplies were abundant in December 1918; cotton, wheat, barley, melons and pomegranates. Fuel is fairly plentiful. Camping grounds are sufficient for a division N. of the city. The vicinity of the Alai qandt is suitable as the water is good. The village of Nur’All Beg (80 houses), 4 miles W.-N.-W. of Saveh,. has good water and camping grounds. Haji Salar-i-Sh uja’ and Amir Naslr are the two most influential personalities. The former is a Baghdadi ShahsavSn tribesman, suspicious of foreign ers and disinclined to be friendly. The latter is well-educated and intelligent and less unreliable than most Persians. In 1920 he was very friendly to the British and an/i-Russian.

Water is obtainable from a good stream, said to be perennial. There is room to water 50 animals at a time. Four hundred trees and 6,400 lbs. dry wood are available as, fuel. Barley, wheat, and maize are grown in small quantities. Camping ground for one brigade of infantry is available. Two roads lead out of the village, one to the N., the other down hilt to W. The former is passable for pack animals, the latter is fit for carts. At first it is tortuous and difficult, leading down' hill for 20 yards with a gradient of 1 in 5. This would prove difficult for Ford cars to negotiate and they would require to be unloaded and driven with care. Road passes over a mill stream with good water just outside Qaitaniehq thence through cultivation to village of Imamzadeh, built round a shrine, at mile 64. Road crosses a trunk bridge, 8 feet wide, over a water-course. It can take Ford vans, 18 pounder guns and Army Transport carts. Near by is a good camping ground for two battalions of infantry and one squadron of cavalry. Thence road traverses undulating desert with sparse scrub. At- mile 10,4 reach Jamshldabad, a village of 12 houses and some ruins. A few acres of wheat and barley and 20 fruit trees grow round village.

Note .—The valley up which the road runs from Saveh to Kargabad consists of wide and open slopes of gravel traversed by several tracks. In February 1921 the direct caravan route from Saveh to Qaitanieh kept well to the west and out of sight of the Mazdakan Chili, and the necessity of fording the river was avoided. ~ This road was fit for carts. It does not pass any villages between Paveh and Qaitanieh, a distance of nearly 20 miles, and caravans make Qaitanieh stage 5, and Xu bar an stage 6. i ng over open country but no difficult gradients are met.

Epitome. The road Qasr-i-Shirln (Persian frontier) to Kamadftb (270 miles) is a perfectly graded motor road, with 12 // metal (S' sole 4' metal), and you can do 40 miles an hour on much of it in any weather except snow. From Hamadan to Enzeli on the Caspian via, Razvin (the Russian road) the road is magnificently graded, but except where it passes through the rock and shale of the Elburz Moun tains has metal without sole. Kazvin to Tehran (90 miles) is the same, but flat. This route is better considered in 4 sections : {a) Baghdad to Kermanshah. {b) Kermanshah to Hamadan. (c) Hamadan to Kazvln. (d) Kazviii to Kazlan (Enzeli),138 Route No. VIII — contd. (a) This is the main caravan and trade route between Mesopo tamia and Persia. It is a road quite passable for wheels in dry weather, but in wet weather, unless the season is an exceptional ly mild one, the road becomes very heavy and in places a regular quagmire. The complete journey is performed in 20 days by camels, and in 14 days by horses and mules. Mules, ponies, and donkeys are the usual transport animals, camels only being used in the summer and not after the rains have set in. As far as Khanikin on the Persian border the road lies over rich alluvial soil, which in many places is subject to inundation. After one inch of rain the whole country becomes so boggy as to be almost impassable. From November to April the road is impassable for camels ov/ing to the rain and snow. A Persian Company was formed in 1905 to put and keep the road in repair. It is now in very fairly good order and quite passable for wheeled traffic, though very rough in places. The range of low hills over which the road passes to Khanikin would offer no obstacle whatever to the construction of a railway. There is a regular carriage service for pilgrims between Baghdad and Shahraban. Between Shahraban and Khanikin stony ranges crop up across the road. As far as Qasr-i-Shirin (stage 7) there are practically no physical obstacles, with the exception of the extremely heavy state the road gets into after rain and the numbers of irrigation channels which have to be crossed. The boat-bridge over the Diala river in stage 2 would require to be improved. It is only fit for the passage of light vehicks, unhorsed and man-handled over, and in its present state is unfit for the passage of guns or heavy vehicles. During heavy floods the boat-bridge is often open for several days at a time. The pass over the Jabal Hamrin in stage 5 is narrow but passable for cars drawn by 4 horses abreast. At the pass in stage 9 guns would have to be double horsed in certain places. The first three miles of stage 10 are stony and exceedingly rough, and the remainder of the stage along the valley is heavy and swampy after rain and passes over frequent streams. In Januan^ and February the cold is considerable and water °ften freezes. During July, August and September the heat is140 Route No. VIII — oonid. These are available in the following numbers 1. Baghdad 2. Baquba S. Shahrabin 4. Khanikiu 15 (about 6 wagons for heavy loads also available). 10 (5 in Baquba, 5 on right bank of PU14). 8 3 Animals are changed half-way on all the stages. As the arabanas leave each place early in the morning there is no question of connecting at the different places. If a pas senger wishes to do a through run arrangements for animals would have to be made beforehand. The hire for a whole arabdnd from Baghdad to Khanikln is about £5 Turkish. Postal service .—There is a bi-weekly postal service from Baghdad to Khanikin which connects with the Persian service at Khanikln. The mails are sent as far as Shahraban by ara bdnd and thence by rider. They take 24 hours to reach Khani- kin. Mules .—The hire of these animals varies exceedingly accord ing to the amount of traffic—-a majidie a stage is a good average. Alternative Stages .— From Kizil Robat (stage 5) to Pai-Ta ] (stage 9). Practicable only for lightly laden mules and for donkeys. From Khanikin (stage 6 ) to Sar-i-Pul (stage 8 ) via ImSra Hasan. Passable only for mules and donkeys throughout its length. From Harunabad (stage 12) to Maidasht (stage 14). This route, with the detour mentioned in the text for guns, would appear to be the best to be followed by wheeled vehicles. From Harunabad (stage 12) to Kermanshah. This is a good road for pack animals, but would not be passable throughout for wheeled artillery. In winter it would be very heavy going. From Salarabad (stage 13) to Kermanshah. This route would be impassable to guns. {b) This is the old post road, and the line followed by the Tehrau-Khanikln telegraph. The road runs through mountainous country, but is passable for motor lorries, Ford vans, field artillery, A. T. carts, and L. A. M. cars, except in winter, November to March (inclusive). The surface is, generally speaking, good throughout, except during ?tage 8 , which is liable to be deep in mud in w-et weather.Route No. VIII -oontd. Vanous short sections are temporarily difficult (July 1918) owing to metalling being at present undertaken. The road over the Asadabad Pass has been realigned, and consequently the pass is now a less serious obstacle than formerly, but is difficult m wet weather. It is closed for wheels by snow for long periods in February and March, and often for days for pack animals. I he worst part of the road all along is through the villages, being the worst of all through Kangavar. From Kangavar to Hama- dan there is an alternative route via Farisvah which is passable for Ford vans, field guns, and L. A. M cars, and is only blocked by snow just east of Hamadan very occasionally and for not more than a few days at a time. H ater. Is good and plentiful at each stage. Supplies.- In normal times supplies of all kinds are plentiful, but, owing to various forces which have been operating in the* country, supplies are now scarce. Wheat and barley may be obtained at Kangavar and Asadabad. There is no difficulty as regards meat. J Fodder. Barley and bhoosa are plentiful in normal times. Fuel. Fuel is fairly plentiful at Hamadan. Grazing.—For camels and cattle only obtainable in sprint? (mid-Febraary to mid-May). ^ ° Obstacles.—In stage 8 the Dinavar River was formerly spanned by the Bisitun Bridge, which has been destroyed. A new arch to the bridge is under construction (July 1918) The present crossing is by a good causeway 200 yards downstream of the bridge. The going on the causeway is heavy for cars (July 1918). A fold 250 yards downstream of the remains of the Bisitun Bridge is passable for motors when the river is not in flood. The passes are liable to be closed bv snow, and the road where it lies in the valleys, becomes boggy during wet weather’ especially the last 12 miles into Asadabad (stage 10 ). Camping Ground.—Good with unlimited space at each stage Communications.—Many routes radiate both from Kerman- shah and^Hamadan. Kermdnshdh is connected by road with : (a) Baghdad p ass able for Ford vans, field artillery, A. T. carts, L. A.

Climate. Kermdnshdh .-—The climate is mild in summer, but very cold in winter. Rain falls from November to April (both inclusive) except in January and February, when it is usually replaced by snow. ' J Hamaddn .—Being situated on a plain 6,000 feet above sea level, it has an almost ideal climate, though intensely cold in winter. Snow remains on the mountains for 10 months in the year. There are yearly outbreaks of fever and cholera. General. The road is good, metalled, and passable through out for all arms, including motor lorries and L. A. M. cars. It is °P en fo l ^ traffi 1 c . at a11 seasons, except that the Sultan Bulaq Pass (Stage 26). which has an elevation of about 7,500 feet and is the highest point on the route, is sometimes closed by sno^v for a day or two in winter ; it is however easily cleared. There was no snow on the Sultan Bulaq Pass during winter, 1916-17, but there was 10 feet of snow on it at the end of Match, 1918, and Ford vans had to be pushed up the gradient on account of snow on 25-2-18. I he width oi the roadway throughout the route is 20 feet, of which 15 feet is metalled. .. . Is scarce as f ar as Kazvln, but between this and Kazian it is plentiful at each stage.Route No. VIIL -contd.

Communications.—-At stage 22 (Ak Bulaq) the Hamadan- Zinjan road takes off m a northerly direction. It is not passable throughout for wheeled traffic, but is so f .r nfantry, cavalry, and pack transport. At stage 27 (Ab-i-Garm) a road leads east to Tehran ; it is fit for transport. At stage 28 (Nahavand) a track fit for pack leads north to Yuzbashi CEal which is the 13th stage on the main road to Kazian. The distance from Nahavand to Yuzbashi Chal is 35 miles as against 73 by the main road via Kazvin. In winter, however this route is impassable on account of deep snow. At stage 29 (Siahdahan) the main road, unmetalled, to Zinian takes off in a v*esterly direction. It is at present (August 1918) fit for field guns, A. T. carts, and Ford vans, and is being improved. 6 At stage 31 (KazyTn). {a) The main road to Tehran runs in a b.-E. direction. Fit for all arms and motor lorries at all seasons.

For the first 3 miles the road is a broad level track over a plain of alluvial soil showing frequent signs of flood. At 9 miles an irrigation channel is crossed by a rickety wood and stone bridge of twelve feet roadway, width 12 feet, depth below bank 3 feet. There are a few crops near here. At 11 miles the road runs past a walled sarai and a quarter of a mile further on a second irrigation channel, similar to the first, is crossed. On the other side of the channel the postal staging station is reached. From here an irrigation channel runs parallel to the road to 12 miles, thence diverging N. At 16i miles the road crosses a line of mounds running N.-E. and S.-W indicating a former large canal. The road from here agnin shows signs of flood till, at 18 miles, Khan Bani Sa’ad is reached. This is a village with two sarais, one of which is 100 yards square of massive brick, in which there is accommodation for 300 men and horses.

At 12. miles, the right bank of the Diala’ river is reached, a sluggish stream, 60 yards wide with deep cut banks. There are gardens, dates, and poplar trees on either hand. The road now runs up the river bank, the ground being cut up by natural water channels running down to the river. At 12| miles a small sarai is passed to the left of the road and the Diala river is crossed by a swimming bridge which is unfit for guns, consisting of 11 boats (with 2 spare for increasing the span when the water rises) over which a 12-feet road-way is laid. It is a rickety structure, quite serviceable for pack transport,’ but unfit for any wheeled vehicles except very light ones. The pontoons are in good condition; a very slight repair (materials for which are obtainable on the spot) would put the roadway into condition for the passage of guns. Guffahs are obtainable by which large quantities of stores could be quickly transported across the river : Guffahs will hold from 4 to 20 persons with a corresponding weight of stores. The approaches on both sides are soft and likely to be slippery after rain. The banks of the river are perpendicular, the right being 15 feet and the left 30 feet above the level of the water. The road now runs in an easterly direction through high walled gardens, and at 13 miles enters Bakuba where there is a telegraph and a post office. There is a good camping ground to be found anywhere outside the town. The road throughout is good and passable to all arms with the exception of the Diala bridge. No camels.

At 3 miles, crossing an irrigation channel, C70GSB 2 k146 Route No. VIII — contd. the road turns into a north-easterly direction which is main tained to the end of the march. The road here is a broad and level track over an alluvial plain. To the N.-W. lie numerous villages, and the ground is low and in parts marshy, and cut up by frequent irrigation channels in some of which is water. To the east is a bare plain stretching to a distant range of low hills, on which there are a few hamlets visible; the plain is green with camel thorn and patches of grass. At 12 miles there is cultivation on either side and large villages four miles to the N.-W. At 16 miles is a caravansirai of Abu Jisra, in which there is accommodation for some 200 men and horses. This is not a usual halting place for caravans which generally go right through. There is plenty of room for camping close by. The road is good and passable to all arms in dry weather, some of the canals would require ramping and some of them are crossed by rickety bridges. In wet weather, the worst part of the road is the last mile. Water .—Good but muddy from canals. Fuel. —Scarce. Fodder .—Good grazing. Supplies .—Could be collected from the neighbouring villages.

On the right is a deep high-banked irrigation canal. Numerous irrigation channels cross the road which is somewhat confined with banked canals on either side ; this applies to the whole stage. At 6 miles the road passes between the high walled caravans'irai, 100 yards square, of the village of Jallali, where there are gardens and date palms. Emerging from the village the road crosses a canal, 30 feet broad, running swiftly S.-E; the bridge consists of one 12 -foot arch of stone, strong, and in good repair. At 10 miles Shahraban is reached, where there fs a telegraph office and post office, several caravansarais, and a roofed bazar. There are walled gardens and date groves. No camels.

Irrigation channels cross the road and there are signs of flood in places. At 1 mile two canals are crossed in succession by bridges of strong masonry ; the road is now gravelly over un dulating country. At 6 miles, bare low hills are entered, the road, a broad stony track, ascending some 150 feet gently to a kulal. The descent is similar to 7^ miles, when, emerging from the hills, the road crosses the stony plains to 11 miles. From this point another range is traversed to 14 miles, when a level plain of alluvial soil commences, bounded on all sides by low hills. There are villages some three miles to the north-west, with flocks and wheat fields. At 17| miles a low gravel ridge is crossed and Khanikin comes in sight.

The road, which is now a broad track, level in some places, and up and down rounded spurs in others, skirts at 5 miles a bend of the Hulvan river, and ascends gradually over spurs of hills to the north, mostly over loose stones and shingle. At 10 miles there is a stream of poor water. From 13 miles onwards, streams of good water are crossed. At 15 miles the road ascends a small hutal overlooking the Sar-i-Pul valley to which a descent is made over hard and good going. At 18 miles, the course of a large irrigation channel is followed. At 18| miles, an irrigation stream with a broad gravelly bed is •crossed, and at 20 miles Sari-Pul is reached, which is a dirty and ruinous village above the right bank of the Hulvan river. The valley is mainly abandoned in winter at which time sup plies would be very scarce.

At 3 miles the valley widens, and the hills recede, are lower, and have fewer trees. The road enters and crosses frequently the stream which drains the valley. At 6 miles it emerges on to a grassy plateau, which gradually expands into a cultivated valley, three miles wide. At 74 miles is the village of Sari-Mil consisting of a few huts. A side road from here runs over the hills northwards to Gavarra. The route now skirts the base of the hills to the north of the valley, and streams are crossed frequently. At 8 £ and 1 B£ miles, respectively, are the villages of Halateh and Harir on the left of the road. At 12 miles is a domed imwz. About this point the divide is passed where water flows east and west. At 14 miles the gardens of Kafmd are reached. The road is now of rough laid boulders between garden walls. The lower part of Karind is passed through at 15 miles, and half a mile further on open ground beyond is leached; here there is plenty of room for camping and a large sarai in bad repair.

At the bifurcation on the pass the right hand track should be taken as it is slightly shorter. A small stream rises here. Leav ing the pass the track, at first rough, descends gradually and passing over undulations reaches the broad plain of Maldasht at 8 miles. The plain is watered by many streams, at the cross ings of which the road is very deep and heavy. There is a considerable amount of cultivation, many sheep and numerous huts of nomad Kurds on the plain. At 12 miles, the Ab-i-Mark, a stream 15 yards wide, with a firm bottom and 2 feet of154 Route No. VIII — contd. water in summer, is crossed, the gradients in and out being easy. On the other side of the stream is the village of Maldasht, which possesses a large and massive sarai with accommodation for 250 men and horses. The village consists of some 60 huts. There is unlimited room for camping. The road is good and passable for all arms. Maldasht is usually used by caravans as the only halting place between Harunabad and Kermanshah. Water. —Abundant.

At 6 miles the road becomes stony, crossing a stream, and gently ascends a gradually narrowing valley which is well cultivated. At 8 miles some hillocks are ascended to the pass called Ainal Kush, the road being narrow and stony in parts. The summit is reached at miles (5,500'). Thence there is a gentle descent of 200 feet to a cultivated valley, two miles broad. A Tcdrez stream here follows the road, and for the remainder of the stage water is plentiful. At 13 miles the ascent of a low range of hills is commenced, and the pass over them is crossed at 14J miles. Thence there is a gradual descent to the plain, and Kermanshah is reached at 18 miles.

From Kermanshah to mile 16J the road runs over reddish clay, after which to mile 21 it leads over hard gravelly soil. Its direction is E. to the Kara Su River, thence E. by N. to Bisitun. Water is found en route from the Kara, Su River and also from smaller streams. The campingRoute No. Ylll—contd. ground at Kcrmanshah is to the N. of the town. The road gradually descends into a plain until the Kara Su Payer is reached at mile 5 where it is crossed by means of a large stone liidge of six arches fit for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries. The road then ascends and skirts the foot of the lofty mountains of Behistan, keeping them about 2 miles to the N. At mile 7 there is a walled 5 village to the N. of the road, and at mile 9 a larger village situated on a low hill to the S. of the road. At mile 13 the remains of marble walls and columns are to be seen. At mile 16£ is the village of Savarud. At mile 17| the village of Hajiabad is pass, ed. From mile 13 to mile 20 the road undulates over the lower spurs of the hills and gradually descends for the last mile to the camping ground, which is rather confined owing to the ground being intersected by numerous streams, all of which are tribut aries of the Gamasiab River. Bisit ti n is a miserable village of 400 houses with a good water supply from an excellent spring under the Bisitun Pock. The supply is unlimited. It would be a bad halting place in summer as there is no shade. Bhoosa and firewood were obtainable 20th April 1918. 17 SAHNEH .. 20 T m. General direction E.- ‘ N.-E. Inthis stage the .65 m. pitch of the culxerts is very steep and long-bodied lorries have difficulty and are liable to get stuck. The road gradually rises from mile 6 to mile 15, with a long steep ascent to the head of the Kagavah Shikan Pass, which is no obstacle. W ater is plentiful from the Gamasiab. On leaving Bisit'n, a big sarai is passed on the E. of the road. The road runs close along the bottom of the eastern face of the rock of Bisitun. At mile Si the River Dinavar is reached (a tributary of the GamasTab), the bridge over which is known as the Bisitun Bridge. It is built of brick with 4 arches, with a total span of 63 yards. The Turks damaged the crown of the second arch from the right bank on its upstream side. On 25th March _. 18, the remaining portion of the roadway on this arch, which is 3 yards in span, was only 2 ft. 6 in. wide. This remaining portion has a bad oblique crack, but a new pillar is beinc built in the centre of the broken arch (2-8-18). The normal width of the roadway is 7 yards. The present crossing is by a good causeway J0 ° P ards downstream of the bridge. The going on the cause156 Route No. VIII — contd. way is heavy for cars (July 1918). There is a ford 250 yards downstream, the greatest depth of which, on 2oth March 1918, was 3 feet, the width of the deepest channel being about 25 yards, after which it shelves off to a few inches only. Pack animals could not cross with loads on that date owing to considerable current. It was dry on 31st July 1918. Except in flood time, the river is fordable at this point for motors. Motors forded the river here in January, February and March 1918. A raft suitable for Ford vans was finished in April 1918. The road from mile 11 to mile 3 is heavy going along the valley and over cultivated ground. The road keeps to the W. side of a low hill , since the road round the E. side of the hill, although shorter, is not so suitable for wheels. In wet weather the going is very heavy from mile 1J to mile 5, being deep in mud, especially just after leaving Bisitun Bridge and again at mile 4£. At mile 2 the road goes through the small village of Nadirabad. At mile 3^, a three-arched masonry bridge in very good repair (fit for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries) with a 5J yards road way, spans two small streams. At mile 5 is another bridge (fit for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries) over a small stream called the Zarbad, running down from a village of that name lying to the N. of the road. From mile 5 to mile 8 £ the road is good. At mile 6 J, S. of the road, there is a small scattered village on artificial mounds, at the foot of which are poplar tree*. At • mile 7£the road again approaches theGamasiab keeping it to the S. At mile 9 there are tAvo culverts in good repair and fit for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries. All these bridges and culverts (mile 2 to mile 9) require hand rails or wing walls. At mile 10J the River Gamasiab again approaches the road on the S. which now passes under a high precipitous hill on the N. of the road, called Shamrun. At mile 11 the road passes Samaghan. At mile 12 another culvert is crossed; it is also in good repair and fit for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries. Cross spur of low rocky hills by the Kagavah Shikan Pass at mile 16J. The pass is easy. From mile 17-| the road descends acrossthe valley to Sahneh. The roadthroughthe village is very difficult for cars. There is good and ample camping space on the bank of the stream N. E. of Sahneh. Sahneh is a small but flourishing village, situated in a well-watered and cultivated valley, among gardens and plantations, at the foot of a range ofBoute No. VIII — contd. precipitous hills, in which are some ancient caves and sculptures. Sahneh is remarkable for its walnut and mulberry trees. Water is plentiful. Potatoes are grown here. 18 KANG A VAR .. 18 J m. General direction E. • The road is good through- 2831 m. out. For the first 8 miles the surface is slightly undulating and ascends gently to the foot of the pass. Water is good and plentiful from numerous streams. Several insignificant streams have to be forded. At mile 31- there is a defile; the hills to the N. are close to the road and those to the S. are about 1 mile distant. At mile 41 a small spring of fresh water is passed on the S. of the road. At mile 5 the foot of the hills is reached, and at mile SJ a village called Bidsurkh is passed to the S. of the road. On the N. side of the road there is an excellent spring of clear water— unlimited supply. Thence there is a gradual descent down a valley. At mile 61 a high artificial mound is passed, at the foot of which are some stone ruins. Here a fine stream crosses the road from the N. gushing out from a spring in the hillside. This is no obstacle to traffic. At mile 7f a village in a dell under rocky hills is passed about 1 mile to the S. of the road. At mile 81 the top of the Tang-i-Lulan (6,76(b) is reached. Motors must take the more northerly of the two tracks leading over the pass. The pass presents no great difficulties except in wet weather. During the last two miles of the ascent the road is over soft ground which becomes very heavy in wet weather. The last 1 mile is very steep as also is the descent. Both these gradients are very difficult for fully loaded Ford vans, but not so difficult for lorries. A diversion is necessary, which could easily be made. At mile 10 a small walled fort in the valley is passed 2 miles to the S. of the road. At mile 15J the road leads over two broad watercourses running from N. to S. At mile 16 a small river known as the Kabutar Lana is crossed by a fine five-arched brick bridge in good repair, and fit for L. A. M. cars and heavy lorries. The roadway is 4 yards wide. On 28th March 1918 this river was 5 yards wide, shallow and spanned by two of the five arches. In the next J mile the road passes over two culverts in good repair. At mile 17J there is a ford over a small stream, after which there is a steep ascent and several rough places on entering the next village. At mile 18-£ where the153 Route Xo. VIII— contd. suburbs of Kangavar begin there is a sharp right-handed turn over a small masonry bridge (fit for L. A. M. cars and heavy lorries). The camping ground is among fields E. of Kangavar. On a hill overlooking the town are the extensive brick ruins of a fortress. The district is very fertile and contains a large number of villages. Water is abundant. There are several caravan- sarais, which are usually very dirty, and a telegraph office in the town. Population about 5,000. From Kangavar there is an alternative route to Hamadan via Farisvah, Zamanabad, and Alfout, normally passable for L. A. M. cars (see Alternative Stage 1). 19 ASADABAD .. 24 rn. General direction N.- N.-E. The road is good 3071- m. almost throughout in dry weather. It leads over alluvial soil except between the 5 th and 6 th miles, where it is rather stony. The last 12 miles into Asadabad are liable to be marshy. Water is good and plentiful from numerous small streams. At mile 4|- a low ridge is crossed quite easily, the road des cending into a valley. At mile 5 the road crosses a broad rocky ridge. At mile 6 |- is a ford across a small stream called Sar-i-Ab- i-Kharra. At mile 8 a stream is passed to the S. which flows down to a village S.-E. of the road called Deh-i-Mush. At mile 10 Bifuneh village is passed about 2 miles to the N.-W. of the road. At mile 12 J there is a deep pool of stagnant water, bad and saline, called Sujahgur, which is crossed by the fine 4 -areh brick bridge of Pul Shekhna in good repair—fit for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries. _ It is a good landmark. There is a spring 200 yards S. of the bridge. The supply of water from the spring is very limit ed—a bucket can be filled in 10 minutes. At mile 12f a mound is passed to the N. of the road, close by which rises a small stream. From mile 13 to mile 15 the road is bad. At mile 14 the road passes through the large village of Vadarabad, the S.-E. portion of which is surrounded by a ruined mud wall. At mile 15 there is a large village to the' N. At mile 19 the road passes through the village of Deh Buzan, where there is a spring of good water supplying the canals in the vicinity of the road all the way to Asadabad.

At mile 4A a village is passed some distance to the S. of the road. At mile 5 there is a ford over a small stream. At mile 6 a stream is crossed by means of a small burnt brick and rough stone bridge, passable for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries. The bridge is 18 feet long, 9 feet wide, and the surface is very rough. It has one arch (width between piers 5 feet) and there is no parapet; the approaches are fair. The stream is not flowing at present (18th April 1918), but is normally fordable when running. At about mile 7 several villages and ancient ruins (partly of marble) lie on each side of the road. At mile 9 road crosses another fordable stream by means of a bridge (passable for L. A. M. cars and motor lorries), built of burnt brick and rough stones. It has one arch, width between the piers being 18 feet. The total length of the bridge is 20 feet, width 12 feet, surface good. There is no parapet.

From mile 13 to Bijar several small bridges are necessary, but the road is fairly good, passing liasanabad 1£ miles to the east of the road. The road down the pass into Bijar is good. Bijar is curiously situated in a hollow, surrounded by barren peaks rising at several points to about 1,000 feet. It has no defences, except a weak wall enclosed by large gardens. The 5,000 or 6,000 inhabitants are occupied chiefly in agriculture. The high elevation of its site entails the disadvantages of a rigorous winter and a scanty water supply. In winter snow sometimes blocks all the roads and isolates Bijar. W ater. —Scanty. Fuel. —Scarce.

A branch of the alternative route from Alvand Mull, stage 7, mile 7£, comes in here from the S.-W. (See Alternative Stage 1, stage 1, mile 15.) Two tracks lead from here, the direct one up the ravine N. of Panje Bala being a very186 Route No. X— contd. Bteep climb impossible for anything but pack animals. The other track leads up the valley to the W. and is a more gradual rise, but the path is bad and strewn with large boulders. This path from the top of the ascent leads along a fairly level ridge and open plateau to Jafarabad, mile 12, where those two tracks again join. There is a stream down each defile : the W. one is good water and there are trees and vineyards on the hill slopes. There is very little water in the N. stream and it is bad, though the supply might be increased by a little digging. From the edge of the plateau the N. road leads across the level to Kush- makan at mile 8. The alternative route from A1 and QulT, stage 7, mile 7| , joins here from the S.-E. A stream is crossed at mile 8, immediately after which the road leads round the E. side of the village of Kushmakan where there is a poplar plantation, Jafarabad, a ruined village, is reached at mile 12. Here there is a hill and also a ridge that could be held, but water is only obtainable from the river and villages, and the position can be walked round without any difficulty. The position might be held to delay an enemy but not for more. The hill of Kuh-i Kara Towara, 6 miles to she W. is very conspicuous. Kizil Bulaq is reached at mile 16?. Here there is no cultivation, but large numbers of sheep, cattle and donkeys were seen (July, 1918). There are 100 houses at Kizil Bulaq, but they were all deserted with the exception of 10.

Here a watershed is reached which affords a good position except for lack of water and flanks that can be turned by a very wide movement. From here Sabil, at mile 6, and the road half-way to Sam Kaleh can be seen.

The stream passes on through a small rocky defile about | mile from the road. Hie road descends by a steep gradient, which might be im proved, to a valley running N. and S., which widens to nearly a , 6 on the X. and closes to a rocky to on the S. The vi ages of Ala Sakai and Aminabad are visible, the latter being188 Route No. X— contd. situated miles to the N. of the road among the fields. At mile the road crosses the River Saruk means of a 3-arched bridge, the arches being 21, 28 and 21 feet in span. The road way over the bridge is 15 feet wide and is roughly paved with stones. Sbone balustrades flank the bridges. The gradient of the roadway is easy. The bed of the river is stony, 100 feet wide, with water 8 inches deep, in a channel 20 feet wide on 8th August 1918. On leaving the bridge the road rises straight up the W. face of the valley for more than a mile. The gradient is steep throughout and very st?ep as the summit is reached. The road could be better graded. There is a good spring two-thirds of the way up. From the top the road descends for 300 yards and then rises for 1 mile -where there is a good position for defence. The village and gardens of Chugli are seen 1| miles to the W.-N.- W. The road descends steeply for 1 mile (the gradient being difficult to rectify) and crosses a stream from Chugli; thence rise up the W. face of the valley by the most westerly of three tracks, other two tracks leading to Chugli.

The road is . ’ passable for nack animals only On leaving Sanjud, the track is bad though the surface is soft and improvable. The gradient is rather steep but not improvable. The track runs N. by E. for 1 mile down a defile where it joins a valley running E. and W. with a river 20 feet broad and 18 inches deep (July 1918). The road crosses the river by a single-span stone bridge. The roadway is 20' feet wide and paved with stone. The road then keeps on the S side of the river and at mile 3 enters a defile 6 miles long A position, strong in itself, could be taken up here, but with the left flank exposed. Transport here proceeded by the river bed for 100 yards as the track by the hillside was bad for pack ani mals (2-8-18). The track here would need some blasting in order to improve it. At mile 4 the track leaves the River Qfirah Chai and passes the village of Kizil KabI (25 houses). From this point the country becomes more rolling as the road passes over the lower parts of the spurs from the high hills on the N. At mile 8 are the stream and village of Koijek, about 20 houses. A position could be taken up here, overlooking the Sain Kaleh plain. From Koijek the road descends in a W.-N.-W.direction on to the plain at mile 9 over which it winds to Sain Kaleh. The- Qurah Chai River is about 1 mile .to the S. of the road. On the N. side of the road are scattered low hillocks and broken ground. The surface of the road from mile 9 to mile 15 is level and good.' A small plantation with a spring is passed to the N. of the road just before reaching Sain Kaleh, at mile 15. Sain Kaleh is a small village of 100 houses. The fort stands on a high natural mound and is strongly built, but is without water.

In Avinter and spring, the valley of the Jaghatu is extensively inundated; communication is carried on betAA'een the villages on either bank by boats. At such times the road on the hill- skirt becomes difficult, but never impassable. But little snow falls in the valley itself. The high plateaux about Mahi Bulaq are covered with snow for tivo or three months, and impassable o en lor several days. Caravans pass over the snow when hard- eneffi the gradients being everywhere easy. The villages of the Atsnar district are small, for the most part mere hamlets. They number about 100 in all, Avith an average of 20 houses, giving a population of 10,000 souls. There are also about 200 tents of nomads. The villagers are Kurds and Turks Avith a few Afshars, to which tribes also the Khan belongs.

He makes the following remarks on these stages:— Tabriz to'Ou.gan or Ganddn .—Striking S.-W. from Tabriz, this route skirts the western spurs of Sahand as far as the town of Gugan, 34J miles. To right of the road extends level plain, stretching to the foot of a high range known as the Kuh Gaunnui, distant 25 to 30 miles, and to the shore of Lake Urumieh, Gfigan lying about 3£ miles from the lake shore. There are few villages within the mountain ous tract dominated by the Sahand peak, and the pasturage is poor. The plain is fertile, but somewhat scantily watered, the small streams flowing from Sahand being almost entirely consumed in the irrigation of the vineyards and orchaids. The large villages, 'Khusrushah (1,000 houses), Ukhiji (300 houses), Mamaqan (500 houses), Dehkhvarqa (800 houses) and Gandan (1,000 houses), having in all 8,600 houses, representing a population of 18,000, do not grow corn sufficitnt for their own consumption. This apparently has long been the condition of agricul ture in the district, but of late years a large demand for dried fruits for foreign export has stimulated the production of fruits, and rendered the villagers even more than formerly dependent on external supplies of grain. Probably not more than an average of a month's supply per family would be found in the villages at any time of the year, and in summer much less. This also would be available only at a very high price or by prompt requisition. Forage would be even more difficult to procure on the spot iu large quantities.

The first is a madejoad as far as Rudisar, connecting the towns of Resht Rauijan, Langarud and R'idisar, and is the only easy lateral means of communication inland across the Gilan plain. ‘ n ,, e /^ ater .P art of it traverses a raised causeway through paddy fields with innumerable plank bridges over irrigation canals, except in the vicinity of Lahljan, where the country is more open and dry. It is passable for Ford vans as far as Hashtabad, stage 1, where they are stopped by the Safid Rud, the largest river m Northern Persia, which is crossed by a ferry but can be forded during the low-water season (for detailed description -vv stage 2 below), and for Army Transport carts to hangarod, stage 3, or if culverts were repaired to Rudisar, stave \ , j ng ’ however &gt; t0 the obstacle of the Safid Rud little wheeled traffic uses the road E. of the river. The surface generally is fair in dry weather, but requires frequent repairs, as much of it is soft and sandy. The second section is an unmade sandy track close to the sea along the beach and sandhills, used by the local villagers and lias little traffic except in the more populous rice-producing areas and is only passable for ponies or mules. . V le san&lt; ^ 18 in parts soft and rather heavy going, but is infinitely better than the mud and swamp which make inland tracks in Gilan and Mazandaran so execrable. I he only obstacles along this route are the innumerable rivers and streams which must be crossed. As far as Langarud they are bridged with the exception of the oafTd Rod. Between Langarud and Rudisar irrigation ditches are crossed by culverts, but the bigger watercourses have only foot-bridges (passable for animals) and the Shalman is not bridged. E. of Rudisar, with few exceptions, e.g., the foot-bridge over the Sarpul stream, stage 5, a ferry-boat over the Pul-i-Rud, in stage 5, and foot bridges over the Gazafrud, stage 5, which in 1920 was in bad216 Route No. 2 — contd. repair and unfit for animals, and the Nishtarud in stage 7 and the Namak&amp;brad in stage 8, ferry-boats or bridges do not exist and the mouth of a small river must be forded about every mile or less. This constant fording is wearisome but usually not difficult. The streams are of two kinds. (1) Streams rising in the mountains. (2) Mur dab, or marsh streams, rising in the foot-hills with in a fe w miles of the coast. The streams from the mountains have a rapid fall and have formed wide stony watercourses, some of these exceding £ mile in width. Their water, however, is diverted for irrigation and normally they are almost dry, and, except the Pul-i-Rud, which is always a big river in spring, they become unfordable only during spates caused by sudden deluges of rain in the mountains, when in a few hours they may become huge torrents, which as rapidly subside. None of these mountain streams are bridged. The principal are :— Safid Bud. (Stage 2). —Big ferry boats. The crossing is described in stage 2 below. Shalmdn. (Stage 3).- —Small boat for passengers only. In October 1919 water was 8' wide and T deep. In May it was swollen but fordable. PuUi-Rud. (Stage 5).—-The water is diverted for irrigation, but this river is particularly liable to sudden floods and in May and June it is swollen into a big river by melting snov r water, and becomes unfordable or fordable with difficulty. Ferry 7 -boats. Chalkarud (Stage 6.) Chashmeh Glleh or Seh Hazdr or Mazdr. (Stage 6). —Brings down a lot of snow w 7 ater in May and June, but it is largely diverted for irrigation and normally is fordable, Snow water comes down later than in Pul-i-Rud owing to the greater height of the ranges draining into it. Izdrid, near Nishtd (Stage 7). —A minor stream. SarddbrZd (Stage 8). —A minor stream with a wide gravel bed and easily fordable. Chains (Stage 5).—A considerable stream and sometimes unfordable for 2 or 3 days at a time from melting snow water in April and May.217 Boute Ko. 2— contd. » Tte Myrdabs, or marsh streams, are .sluggish and not liable to flooas like the mountain streams.

Drinking 11 nfer.—Supply is unlimited throughout from streams. It is liable to surface pollution. .J! 16 stri P of lowlands between the Caspian and the hills is thickly populated, and villages are,numerous all along the route especially on the deltas formed by the mountain streams where’ the strip is broader and water for irrigation of rice fields is abundant. Iisn is obtainable all along the coast. Rice is grown in great quantifies on all the deltas formed by the rivers flowing rom Ihe mountains. Wheat and barley are not grown on these lowlands and nee is the staple diet of men and animals. The change of diet to rice and rice straw disagrees w th animals from the plateaux of 1 ersia. A small stock of wheat and barley is available at the bazaar at Khurramabad (in Tunakabun) in stage ’ Pui : elsewhere wheat and barley are scarce and must be im ported from the hill districts S. of the road, the most productive being Dailiman (around headwaters of the Pul-i-Rrd), Do Hazar (a tributary of the Seh Bazar in Tunakabun, 1 stage from Khurramabad), ee Kazvin-Salambar-Shahsavar, Lateral Route Ro. VI (3)], Kalardasht and Kujur. Sheep and dairy produce are abundant from October to Fay, but during the summer all flocks and herds are drawn away in to ilie highlands. Vegetables are farily plentiful. For supplies at A mill see Route Xo. I.218 Route No. 2— -contd. Transport ,—Ponies are the transport animals used in the lowlands and are owned by the villagers for local use in consider able numbers. It is, however, difficult to obtain them on hire. Mules come down all the trade routes from Tehran and Kazvin to the Caspian coast. Fuel, —Supply unlimited throughout. Grazing, —Ail open ground near the coast is grass covered. Grazing is best in spring and autumn. In winter all the herds are down in the lowlands and the grass is cropped very close. Communications,-^-AW routes from Tehran and Kazvm to the Caspian strike this route. Telegraph. —Persian telegraph administration single line on wooden poles R-sht—Lahijan—Langarud—Rudisar—Khurram- &amp;bad (in Tunakabun). Telephone also as far as Rudisar, with a connection also at Rashtabad, stage 1. Climate. —Temperate, healthy and pleasant October to May; June, July and August are hot and relaxing. A sea breeze usually tempers the heat near the beach, which is fa irly free fr in the mosquitoes which swarm in the belt of rice cultivation between the coast and the foot-hills. Tactical. —E. of R'disar most of this route is commanded from the sea, which affords a much easier and a quicker means of communication. Inland tracks through jungle and rice ewamps do exist, but are abominable. Alternative Stages. —Villages are numerous either on the coast or else hidden away in the jungle within a mile or two of it and stages can be shortened if preferred. ITo. of stage and total distance.

It runs along a causeway with a sandy surface, passing rice swamps and many straggling hamlets. K ch-i- Tsfahan at 14 miles with a main street and bazaar 200 yards long is the only place of any size. The country is well wooded with hedges o£ bramble, hazel wood and alder. It is level to the220 Route No. 2— cortfd. u pointed and the slope on each side is very steep. The river bed is shingle and sand between high, steep banks. Depth of water in October 1919 and May 1920 did not exceed 2' and was easily fordable. At Bazkia Qurab shrine, 8 miles, the road from Siahkal joins, see KazvTn-Daiiiman-Lahljan, Lateral Route No. VIII (?), The woods have now given place to open common land with brambles and fern and there is no rice cultivation. At 9 miles the road fords a stream which flows down to Langarud. The watercourse was 60' wide, but water was only 10' wide and 6' deep in October and again in May. A bridge was being con- etructed in 1920. From the ford the road makes an easy ascent to Lahijan. Lanijan, population about 11,000, formerly the principal town of Gilan, but now eclipsed by the commercial expansion of Resht, is a quiet old residential country town with well-built red brick houses, prettily situated near wooded hills. It is on a slope with gravelly soil and the summer climate is much drier and healthier than in other Gllan towns. The town has 0 oarwanasariis and 3 bazaars with 300 shops. Silk, tea, cigarettes* tobacco, rice and oranges are the chief produce. Transpo't .—A good deal of poney transport is seen on the Resht-Lahijan road and a few mules come via Siahkal; 300 or 400 local ponies might be collected at 5 days’ notice but with difficulty. Vehicles are few and mostly private carriages. Good water from wells. Telegraph and telephone. Camping ground on Sabzi Maidan E. of the town, level and grass covered ; measures 570 yards by 250. * 3 LANGARUD .. 11 m. General direction -— S.-S.-E. The road 39 m. continues good for 21 miles until it comes under wooded hills with stony blocks on their slopes to the right. Their height is at iirst about 300' and further on increases to about 800' above the road. Lower down to the left are jungle, ricefields and mulberry plantations, intermixed with occasional tilamldrs (silk granaries) and houses. The road along the base of these hills deteriorates; large stones protrude and the wooden culverts are narrow. The ditches, however, are small and timber is abundant.

Langarud is surrounded by trees and rice swamps and the summer climate is abominable. Water is plentiful from river or wells but both are considered unwholesome, and good dunking water is fetched from Llehkuh (on the Lahijan road). From IIay to September, when the surrounding rieefields are flooded round Maidan Wlthln the town is the only dry camping r CT)ISAR .. ..8 m. General direction E.-N.-E. The road at first runs nearly E. and is raised above the ricefields. The shrine of Dubararan is passed on the left and a little further on that of Safid Astaneh on the right. The last village belonging to Langarud is ivikalayeh: its houses are all thatched, and evidently belongs to cultivators in easy circumstances. At 2J miles at Rarlaslr is a wmoden foot-bridge (for men and animals), ET long, built cn 4 trestles over a creek. In October 1919 it only contained a trickle of water, and a carriage forded it with ease. At 4 miles is the Shalman, also called the Lalehrud, with a gravelly water course 60 yards wide. In October water w^as 10' wide and 1' deep. In spring it was fordable for animals without swimming and passengers crossed by boat222 Route No. 2.— contd. Lateral Rente No. VTII (r) from Ka vm via Amlish joins here. The road, after crossing the Shalman, takes first a N. and then a N.-E. direction. A short distance further cross the Baliseh, which joins the Shalman, by a brick bridge ; this stream marks the boundary of the Ranikuh district. At Mianpushteh, 6 miles, a foot-bridge for men and animals crosses a deep still stream 15' wide and 1 V deep between high banks. Vehicles ford. Ford vans would probably be unable to ford these 3 streams of Darlasar, Shalman and Mlanpushteh. The Darlasar and Mianpushteh could easily be bridged, but the Shalman becomes a big swift stream in spring. In parts of this stage the road does not exceed 10' in width. The surface is sandy; many wooden culverts are in bad condition and narrow and a carriage crosses them with difficulty. Timber is plentiful and they could be quickly repaired and the road made passable for carts with ease. From Mianpushteh the road goes E.-S.-E.; then S.-E. At the entrance to Rudisar the Kiahrud, a sluggish stream 80' wide, 2'deep, between banks 11' high, is crossed by a very lofty pointed brick bridge of 2 arches, SJ bricks thick. The roadway is 12' wide. Rudisar is a large village with a bazaar, population 2,500 to 3,000, about 1 mile from the sea, and rice is collected for export. Telegraph anrl telephone. Water plentiful from stream and wells but of indifferent quality. Camping ground is unlimited along sandhills and in meadows.* In summer proximity to the sea is desirable to escape mosquitoes. 5 AB-I-GARM .. 26 m. General direction S.-E. 73 Beyond Rudisar the road becomes a natural track worn by animals and is never used by wheels. It might be cleared and made passable to the Caspian without much difficulty but the beach would be extremely heavy going. At h| miles from Rudisar the road crosses the Sarpul stream to a village of the same name. The stream is slow flow- ing in October it was 60 wide and 1' deep—and is crossed by foot-bridge for men. Animals ford. The road is open, sandy and good across common land with some box and lailaki bushes. At KiskI Mahalleh, 3h miles, it turns half left to the Caspian where its direction changes from N.-E. to E.-S.-E. and223 Route No. 2—contd. Jt runs along the beach, or in places along a strip of sand turf and bushes between the shore and the jungle or ricefields. Ihe scenery along the Caspian is usually of the same character and soon becomes monotonous. The coast line stretches in a series of shallow indentations without a break. A narrow strip of sand is bordered on one side by the sea, on the other by a level a luvial belt of varying width, sometimes wooded and sometimes cleared for rice cultivation, especially at the deltas formed bv rivers from the mountains where the belt is widest and water is available for irrigation, backed by forest-clad hdls ascendina to the^ bare ridges of the Elburz Mountains. The surface of the beach varies, and in some parts it is firm and m others very soft. Its hardness or softness seem to depend on he width and slope, the wider and more leyel sections pro bably being submerged during storms and beaten hard by the waves. In the soft sections animals sometimes sink knee-deep crossing some of the brooks, but there are no quicksands. T) -. The _ I)astk,:i,a an:1 5 sraa b streams are passed and then the Pui-i-Rud is reached. This river issues from the the Soman Kuh. It has a very wide stony bed which holds little water in autumn, but brings down a big flood in April and May, when it is er tssed by a ferry-boat, and is considered the most'formid able river along this coast after the Saf d Rod. It has also a bad reputation for sudden spates. Near its mouth there is a sturgeon fishery station, numerous villages am} much rice cultivation. This is the end of the Gilan plain and to the E. the hills approach the coast. About 2 miles from Pul-i-Rud cross the Gazafrud near a big village of the same name. It is a deep marsh stream. In 1919-20 a ft o-bridge over it was unsafe for animals. In October and Maythev could just ford without swimming. Next to the Pul i-Rud this is the biggest stream forded along this route (excepting of course sudden spates which may render quite small streams impassable). Past the large village of Nau 1 eh, which has 2 mosques ; then cross the Lazarjan and a little further is the Ab-i-Khushkeh Rud; the latter stream can be broad in spring and fordable only at RazI Mahalleh. The next streams to be crossed are the CJshian, a few other brooks, and then the Achadrud, also known as the Khushkalat. The mountains at this part descend to w'thin 2 miles of the coast, and the river, though at times almost dry, when in spate, stops224 Route No. 2— contd. traffic. A bit of jungle and the Chashmeh-i-Malikjuh have now to be traversed before Chabuksar and its stream are reached at 16 miles. The sand is very soft here. Then comes the Mandeh Rad, whi:;h is a large stream, and the Surkhanl. The road now rounds the Sakhtsar hills, a prominent spur of which, called Safid Tamlsheh, reaches very nearly to the water’s edge and forms the boundary between Gllan and Tunakabun in Mazandaran, and then bends inland away from the coast S.-S.- E. through boxwood to the village of Darlapushteh, about 30 houses, with a mosque and shrine, and many rice fields and mulberry plantations. The track ceases to be sandy and tra verses a causeway constructed by Sipah Salar through rice cultivation, passing several villages with orange groves. The surface is firm and good and a welcome change from the soft sand. Ab-i-Garm is a village about 4 miles from the sea with 6 large hot springs, besides many smaller ones. Its bathing tank and waters attract numerous visitors.. Rudisar to Ab-i-Garm is a long stage but is not difficult for mounted men and is generally done in a day by Persians. Pack animals take 10 hours with halts. Infantry can break it by halting at one of the villages passed en route; e.g., Gazafr d or Darlapushteh. At Chabuksar supplies are scarce. There are doubtless other villages in the jungle, which would be known to a guide but they are not v sible from the coast. An alternative route follows the coast instead of turning inland to Ab-i-Garm, but the sand is here very soft and heavy. 6 KHURRAMABAD .. 14 m. The Sipah Salar’s road continues to 87 m. Khurramabad and in 1920 was in excellent condition. An alternative route branches off from it about 3 miles from Ab-i-Garm, and leads to the beach, which it follows to Shahsavar [see Kazvin-Salambar-Shahsavar, Lateral Route No. VI (6)], at 16 miles, after passing Saiyid Mahalleh village with extensive mulberry plantations and kitchen gardens, the Chalkarud with a bed of 150 yards broad near its mouth, the Shirr lid and a few other minor streams. This coast route is a couple of miles shorter than the inland route via Khurramabad, but the softness of the sand in traverse makes it more tiring, except in summer when a sea breeze tempers the heat and keeps pff mosquitoes. f22o Route No. 2—contd. are bridged and the ChalkarIs To^dirir Akr 11 ^ M Stream * ^ ^ (S miles.

The road now, though lying close to the sea, passes through a jungle of box trees. miles from ’Abbasabad the Kharrek R d is crossed—a very winding and sluggish stream. On its right bank is the village of Jamshldabad. From here there- are 2 roads, one along the beach and the other through the jungle, meeting on the beach at 2 miles from Jamshidabad. No other villages are passed on the coast, but Kalarabad (25 houses) is 1| miles inland by a good track. The following rivers, amongst others, are forded in the day’s march: the Pala-geh R'-d, the Narnakabdr id (bridged), the boundary between Tunakabun and Kalaristaq, the Nau- ibd, the Hacheh Rod, the Sardabrud from Kalardasht, near the mouth of which there is a Russian fishery station, and 2 miles beyond it the Chalus. The two last named are mountain streams and subject to floods. The dial's s the largest river between Pul-i-ri d and Haraz and marks the boundary between Kalaristaq and Kujur. Salmon are trapped at the mouth, and it is the most productive of the Caspian salmon .rivers after - the Chashmeh Gileh at Shahsavar. Near these rivers the hills recede to a distance of 4 miles from the sea, and this district of Kalaristaq is all irrigated and cultivated. Many villages. Abrang, 1 mile from sea and midway between Sardabrud and dial is, is the largest and most prosperous and a good halting place. The Tehran-Chal r s route.

Ziegler &amp; Co., who are engaged in the carpet-weaving industry. The carpets are made in .the villages and town of Sultanabad. The country round is fertile and produces average crops of cereals ; vines flourish. Supplies are procurable; transport scarce and must be collected from villages; donkeys are much used by the villagers.— {Gazetteer.)

The n w road leaves Sultanabad round the town, which obviates any going through the bazaar. From Sultanabad to Navarzin, mile 13, road is excellent. From Navarzin to Surakh the road is in good order. At 4J miles the village of Marsiziran is passed on the left. Here two roads branch off to Hamadan ; that on the left leading over the hills, and that on the right skirting the hills and remaining on the edge of the plain.

Road at first 244J m. runs S.-W. for 4 miles through boggy ground, and is very heavy in wet weather. At U miles the ruins of a large village are passed. On the right is a canal 5 feet broad leading from the river. At 24 miles two small aqueducts are crossed. At 4 miles the river is crossed by a ruined masonry bridge, which consisted formerly of nine arches, three of which have fallen away, and have been (1904) roughly repaired with wooden beams. Carriages must be led across. The river is easily fordable in July. The main stream is only 6 to 6 feet broad. This bridge was formerly protected by two small mud forts, now uninhabited. Road then goes W.-N.-W., crossing a large plain for the best part of the stage. It is heavy going in wet weather, especially the part near the river. At 8 miles is the village Dehchal, close to the road on the right. There are 50 houses, 50 yoke of oxen and 700 sheep. Yearly produce 1,300 kharwdrs of grain. At 10^ miles is the small village of Kuhran. At 13 miles there is cultivation on the‘right and grazing on the left, where are several large flocks of sheep. At 16 miles is the village of ’AJitutal, consisting of 50 houses. There are 1,500 sheep here. The yearly produce is 900 kharwdrs of grain. Near here were some Zand nomads from the direction of Qum, said to number 1,500 tents. Horses are changed at ’Alitutal. Road then goes N.-N.-W. At 17 miles a marshy lake is reached, where large numbers of cattle are seen grazing. The lake is skirted till its end is reached at 19 miles. There is cultivation on both sides of the road. At 20 miles is a large village, Kurd Khurd, containing a fort, 400 houses, 2 qandts, and 4,000 sheep. Yearly produce is 1,500 kharwdrs of grain. Mdlidt is 1,500 tumdns cash. At 23 miles the road gradually ascends. The soil is a light clay, and crops are good and wild flowers in abundance ; water is obtainable from an open qandt.

Epitome. this road may conveniently be divided into two sections : That lying within the Kermanshah jurisdiction to the head of the Harsin valley at the Gashur pass in stage 3. IT—That in Luristan from the Gashur -pass to Khurram- abad. I.—Is inhabited almost throughout in settled villages. The best time for the passage of this section is from June to the end of August -vide Supplies below. In winter the passage of troops would be less easy owing to the snow from December to Febru ary, but the route is practicable throughout the year. Cavalrv could reach Harsin (stage 2) in one march from the Kermanshah plain if necessary. Infantry could, if desired, shorten the stages by halting on the Kermanshah plain (stage 1), 5 miles short of Hajiabad (stage 2), at Chahr (stage 3), and Harsin The road is passable for all arms as far as Tamarq at the head of the Harsin valley. From there to the Gashur pass, 3 m., requires widening and improving for the passage of artillery. I he gradients are not steep. IL—The second section contains no settled village from the Gashur pass to the centre of the Alishtar plain ; nor from Alislnar to Kliurramabad. It is, with the exception of the Ahshtar, entirely deserted from the beginning of October to May. From December to February or March the road is under deep snow ; it must therefore be considered a summer road, tmversable onty from the 15th May to October. The passage of infantry without cavalry would be difficult as the supplies have to be collected from a wide area as a rule, and the flocks and herds required would have to be driven in.

From KERMANSHAH to SHAH TAKHT. Distance 475\ miles. 2 3 stages. Authorities and date.—Yicot, 1894; Bailward, 1905 ; Cruickshank, 1918 ; Mesopotamian Ex peditionary Force, 1918. R .1; , • &gt; Epitome. This route can be divided into four parts —- (a) Kermanshah to Senna, h (&amp;) Senna to Sakiz.Route No. §—contd. (c) Sakiz to Khoi. (d) Khoi to Shah Takht. (a) Epitome.—The route is passable throughout for infantry cavaJry, and pack transport, except between the middfe of November and the end of April, during which period it is habie to become impassabie on account of rain or snow. Kara Su (stage 1) and a canal at stage 2, mile 74, are both always impassable for any type of wheels. If these two obstacles were bridged and the alternative, route taken (see etails below), then with the route in its present condition (July n ^ S !? gi ® m ° t0r ca . r couid be 8 ot through with great diffi- caltj for the first 374 miles as far as Kamiaraa (stage 3). Much ramping and filling in would be necessary for even temporary motor convoy traffic. ^ ^ Surface. Consists of soft surface cracked soil for the first 2b miles (to Warelah) which, when wet, renders the goin^ very heavy for infantry, cavalry, and pack transport and°quite impossible for wheels. After Warelah the surface becomes xiard and well-drained. Water Supply. —Plentiful and good throughout. Supplies.— \. Bhoosa and grain are obtainable at all the larger villages en route by giving notice. Meat is obtainable at Asauleh (stage 4). 2. The valley of the Razavar (in stage 1), that of Gavara (especially near Asauleh), and that of the Qishlaq are fertile m wheat and barley. 3. Apricot gardens are abundant, especially at Kamiaran (stage 3), Asauleh (stage 4), an d Bagh - i - £ erhauz-i- Gu rizeh (stage Fuel. Obtainable at all stages. (Notice should be given.) _ Grazi ng. Was good, though scattered, at all stages in July 1918, except at Samaran (stage u), where it v as poor. Obstacles.—I . The rivers Kara Su, Razava Kharbalan, Gavara, and Qishlaq are liable to become unfordable from mid- Kocember to end of Api il, an 1 are believed to be invariably so in March and April, while the snow is melting. 2. I he canal with its overflow and the stream, both at stage 1, mile 13J require single-span bridges for wheeled traffic. 3. The canal at mile 74 of stage 2 requires a single-span bridge lor wheeled traffic.252 Route No. 6— contd . fl.The road throughout is broken by nullahs and small streams flowing into the main rivers. 5. Irrigation cuts cross the track at intervals throughout the route. Additional Work Necessary .—From Kermanshah to Kam- iaran (stage 3) the route could be made fit for field artillery, ^rmy transport carts, and Ford vans (excluding a bridge over the Kara Su) by one company of Sappers and Miners and one Pioneer battalion in one month. From Karmaran (stage 4) to the Qisblaq river (stage 6), about 40 miles of mountain road would have to be made prac tically ab initio for wheeled traffic, and it is estimated that this would take three companies of Sappers and Miners and two Pioneer battalions at least one year. The present track between these points is in many places dangerous for loaded pack animals and led horses. From the point where the route crosses to the left bank of the Qishlaq river (mile 10, stage 6) up to Senna (stage 7) the route could be made passable for field artillery, army transport carts, and Ford vans by one company of Sappers and Miners and one Pioneer battalion in one month. Camping ground .—Sufficient for one brigade throughout. Alternative Route .—An alternative route to Jafarabad (which is the only possible one for wheels) leads off immediately after fording the Kara Su at stage 1, mile 7J. The route runs along the west bank of the Razavar river, and is perfectly flat throughout, but the soft broken soil over which it passes is likely to become very boggy during and for 40 hours after heavy rain. Daring the flood season (mid-November to mid-April) the fords are impassable. The route was passable for feld artillery, army transport carts and Ford vans on 13th August 1918. If this route be folloAved the end of the stage is reached at Jafar abad (mile 15J), where the alternative route joins the main road. Rain and Floods .—The effects of rain and floods are •— {i) To increase the volume of the stream and fill the nullahs sometimes to overflowing, rendering them impass able for wheeled traffic and possibly also for pack. (it) lo make the first 26 miles of the route (which consists of soft broken soil) very heavy, rendering it impass able for wdieeled traffic and very difficult for pack.253 Route No. 6~contd. (b) This is the main caravan mute between Senna and Safeiz Owing to the unsettled state of the country, it has been liS£ used of late between Divan D'arreh and Sakiz. In its present condition it is suitable for camels and could very easily (except at the Karakhareh Pass) be made practicable for wheeled trans port and guns. Water .—Plentiful and good throughout. Fuel.—Wood is procurable at all stages. Cow dung is also much used as fuel and is plentiful. Fodder. Good grazing in spring and early summer. Chop ped straw and hay in fair quantities could be reckoned on at other times of the year. . Su VV lies.~B&amp;r\ey, wheat, meat and ghi would be available in fair quantities at all halting places. Alternative stages. A track known as the winter road bet. ween Senna and Husamabad. This is used when after heavy falls of snow the Karakhaieh Pass is impracticable. According to native information it is- practically level, avoiding all high ground, and would with a little trouble be passable by artillery. It is a trifle longer than the summer road and the heat along it is said to be excessive in summer. (c) From Sakiz to Sauj Biilaq the road is passable for Ford vans with difficulty. The remainder of the- mad is passable for Ford vans, field guns, and A. T'. carts. General.—The route is probably passable for all arms. On the whole the track is good, though very undulating and ’ hilly in parts, while the stages near Lake Urumleh are intersected by natural and artificial watercourses, which are liable to floods in spring. From Sakiz to Sauj Bulaq the road was graded and made fit for motors by the Russians. The first 4 miles are in good condition, but, as the road has not been regularly used for wheeled traffic for over 18 months, it is certain that the in habitants will have cut irrigation channels across it in many places, and that crossings over streams, etc., will have fallen into disrepair. Probably carts and singl ? cars could get along, but work would be required to make the road fit for regular M. T. traffic. From Sauj Bulaq to Dilman the road is excellent for motors.254 Route No. 6— contd. The route from Urumieh to Khol vii Alternative Stage 4 is passable for all arms. In August 1908 a concession was granted to Iqbal-us- Sultaneh and Haji Shaja Pasha Khan, Makul, for a road from Shah Takht on the Perso-Russian frontier to Urumieh via Khol. The concession gave the road for 70 years to the above Persians or their heirs, on condition they did not transfer their concession to a foreign subject. After that, the road to lapse to the State. The road was to be at least 9 yards broad in the hills and 111 yards in the plains, and to be finished by 1909.” Climate .—Climate appears temperate in summer, but severe in winter, when military operations would be either impractic able or very limited. It is however sufficiently mild to admit of abundant cultivation and fruit trees of all hinds, and seveio enough to prevent extensile operations in winter. In the Urumieh district showers commence at the end of September and continue about a fortnight; then there is a dry spell for 4 or 5 weeks, after which more showers fall just before the snow commences. Snow falls from the middle of December to the middle of March. It is showery to the end of May after the thaw in March. ^ Snow lies on Urumieh plain in January. Supplies. Supplies appear very plentiful in the latter stages on the very fertile Sulduz and Urumieh plains, with numerous flocks and herds. Elsewhere they would be limited. Forage. As with supplies ; very limited, if any, in early stages : later more plentiful. J &amp; Fuel. Fuel in varying quantities obtainable along most of the route; largely manure, but also to some extent the castor- oil plant and barren apricot trees are used for the purpose Ifafer.—Water is very plentiful, chiefly from springs and streams, and m some places from artificial reservoirs. Transport.—-A. heavy type of country cart is met with in stages near UrumTeh, drawn by buffaloes ; also numbers of i/dbus, and near Urumieh itself strings of pack donkeys. The extent to which animals would be available for military purposes could, however, only be determined by very careful estimation on the spot. Physical obstacles.—Tha neighbourhood of Lake UrumTeh, especially the bulduz plain, is very marshy in wet weather and flood time, and would be almost impassable for transportRotTTE No. 6— contd. Several streams with bridges of from 3 to 14 arches are Massed and axe only fordable when water is low.

The route loq m. leaves the main Baah- dad-Hamadan route at a point half-way between the two most northeriy police towers on the north edge of Kermanshah town. Striking off N.-W. through a flat treeless valley, four small irri- gation cuts have to be forded ; these would have to be filled in or bridged for regular M. T. traffic (time required—40 man-hours) but could be negotiated with diffietdty- by a single car. J ' At mile 1 the road crosses a nullah three feet deep and 20&lt; feet wide with gently sloping sides, passable with difficulty for a single car; dry in July 1918. For regular M. T. traffic a nine culvert or fresh bridge would be necessary (time required—50 man-hours).256 Route No. 6 — contd. At mile 2 a nullah ia crossed ; it is three feet deep and 10 feet wide, passable with difficulty for a single car, but requires a ramp for regular motor traffic (time required 20 man-hours). Dry in July 1918. At mile 3£ a footpath strikes off N.-W. to Umarmil, a village £ mile to the west of the road. At mile 3£ two irrigation cuts are crossed, 4 feet wide by 6 inches deep, with soft bottoms. Fresh bridges would be required for regular M. T. traffic (50 man-hours). Stone for these is obtainable at Umarmil. The village of Umarmil is passed at mile 3f, stand ing l mile west of the road at the S.-E. extremity of an isolated hill, which rises 400 feet above the level of the valley. The population of Umarmil was approximately 2,000 in July 1918 ; the inhabitants are mostly cultivators. At mile 5f- the village of Sarab Khushkeh is passed, con sisting of one coffee-house on the road, a group of a dozen huts £ mile E. of the road, and a similar number W. of the road. In July 1918 there was a population of about 100. Thence the road leads N. and at mile 7} meets the S. bank of the Kara Su at right angles. From this point the ford strikes diagonally across the river in a N.-E. direction from shelving bank to shelv ing bank. In early July 1918 the depth was 3 feet and width 35 yards ; the right bank has a slope of 1 in 20, and the left bank one of 1 in 10. The ford has a bottom of hard sand and fine gravel and as a general rule is passable for infantry, cavalry and pack transport only, except in March and April, when it is liable to be unfordable even for these. In dry weather between the end of July and early November it may be passable for a single car. In early July 1918 the banks were 20 feet above water-level; these became vertical up and downstream of the ford. The average width of the river at this point is ap proximately 90 yards and there is a good camping ground on N. bank. After crossing the Kara Su the road continues in a N.-E. direction towards the S. -E. end of an isolated hill which has an altitude of 5,852 feet. At mile 10£ the road swings round to the westward to avoid a marsh, circling back to the front of the. isolated hill and following its S.-W. slopes to the village of Hujjajabad at mile 12|. At this point the route lies through the edge of a marsh formed by the flooding of canals ; the cross ing in early July 1918 was 80 yards long by 2J to 3 feet deep.257 / and 10 equiies ■tonra), •■W. to nile 3| ip, with regular .able at stand- solated The i918; l In ice the ara Sh ronaly shek- width Thank id foe ayalry in it is 'tween ifora above a m of is ap- Tonnd times which round mtof igeof rough cross deep, Route Ko.

At mile J the track 041 m. turns N.-E by N. and follows the E. bank of a stream to mile If where it crosses the sream by means of a ford 25 feet wide and 1 foot deep (early July 1918). At this point a path fit for pack, which has followed the W. bank of the river from Asauleh, joins the main route. At mile 2 the village of Haltushan to the E. of the track is passed and the village of Najafabad becomes visible 3 miles to the W. The path now swings S.-E. up to mile 3 where it turns N. over a very rocky and steep spur, with a down gradient of 1 in 7 for 100 yards. At mile 3J the route leads across the bed of a torrent 30 yards wide with many channels (7th August 1918), flowing down from the N.-N.-W. across the road. The Gavarad river flowing from the E. is reached at mile 6 where the road turns N.; the road conforms with the river and lies along its left (W.) bank. The village of Gaushan is situated on the E. bank at mile At mile 7J the path in some places is only 6 inches wide and dangerous even for led animals. The path continues very rough and difficult to mile 8f where it turns to the W. out of the river bed to a cliff. There is a very steep ascent for f mile to the top of the bluff which forms the cliff. The path now improves and at mile 9| turns N.-W. up the side of a hill with a gradient of 1 in 8 to a bluff 500 feet high (over looking the river), which it climbs at a gradient of 1 in 4. From mile 10 to mile 11 the track leads away from the river, returning steeply to the bank at mile 11. At mile 11J the path crosses another bluff 300 feet above the river with a down gradient of 1 in 7 for 100 yards. From mile 12 the route crosses a spur to mile 12J where the village of Skanna is seen 100 yards up the valley to E.-N.-E. The Gavarad is crossed at mile 13 by a ford 20 yards wide by 2 feet deep (early July 1918). The bed of the ri ver is pebbly and the banks easy. The village of Fark-i-Sulai- man lies on the E. bank-, and the route passes through this262 Route No. 6— contd. the path runs along a canal fringed with poplars and willows to the W. of the route, and at mile 3| passes a flat topped hill 200 feet high situated on the W. of the track. At mile 4 a small poplar grove on the W. of the route affords good grazing ; good water is obtainable here from the canal. The village of Hasanabad lying 4 miles to the westward becomes clearly visible at mile 5 and at mile 6the route leads through the deserted village of Deh Kaisar (consisting of 12 huts), to mile 7 where there is an apricot orchard with willow trees known as Bagh- i-Serhauz-i-Gurizeh on a hill | mile E. of the road. From here the track leads along the edge of a spur with cultivation to the W. of it to mile 8, where the Qishlaq river was easily forded in July 1918. The village of Naryan is passed to the W. of the path at mile 12. Senna is reached at mile 12. Senna is a very old tcwn encircled by a mud wall and situat ed in the midst of an open cultivated valley with abundant water. The town is surrounded by gardens and orchards and a canal runs through it. The climate is healthy. The population is about 32,000. There are numerous places well supplied with water on the surrounding hills wdiere troops could conveniently be encamped in summer. 8 HUSAINABAD .. 21 m.

At about 3 m. the valley is crossed and a ravine entered, the direc tion now being N. At about 4 m. the track emerges from the ravine on to a tongue of high ground. Here a path crosses the track leading from Akbarabad, a village seen in a valley about 2 m. W., to Bakhalabad about 2 m. E. From the high ground the track once more descends to the valley and continues up it for some 6 m The valley, which has a fair sized stream running down it in a S. direction, is extensively cultivated as far as Kherkheh, a small village of some 40 houses which is passed at about 7 m. Beyond this village the valley is little more than a ravine, at first running in a direction slightly E. of N. and veer ing round to due N. The track emerges from it at 10 m. on to an extensive undulating plateau which stretches away to the Jirabad Mts. to the E. and is intersected by a deep vallev to the W. beyond which a,re the Baianchu Mts. The country on both sides is practicaole for all arms, but would be heavy in wet weather. Here a track crosses the route leading from Taji Kran on the E. to Ahmadabad to the W.

General.—This, route forms the best and most natural approach to Iraq from the Central Persian plateau, but considerable previous preparation would be required before the road could be made passable for all arms. The section Halabia-SulaimSnleh is believed to be pass able for wheels. It is reported that motors could go between July and December. In February 1918 snow lay to a dejjth of 1 foot on portions of the road. Climate.—The climate is on the whole temperate, and permits the cultivation of quantities of fruit of all kinds. The snow in winter is nowhere very severe, and the heat in summer is also not excessive. • Supplies —Large flocks of sheep and goats, and herds of cattle are met with en route in most of the stages. Quantities of dairy produce are also brought into Sulaimanieh by Kurdish women. Cultivation is not very extensive, but fruit of all kinds is plentiful. .Route No. %—contd. Forage. Luxuriant pasture is to be found in most ol the fertile valleys through which the route runs, but the supnly of grain is limited.

The construction of a cart-road, if undertaken, would encounter con siderable difficulty between Halabja and the Sirvan (stages 6 and 7), where hill-cutting would be heavy for a few miles. The road between Halabja and Pawah is now (1914)'unfit for loaded mules in several places : Captain Wilson lost a mule on the ascent from the Sirvan (stage 5).

From a^more or less level forest track it becomes a hill path ascending the face of a precipitous narrow and thickly wooded spur by steep, 'short and acute-angled zigzags. ; The total iength of the zigzag ascent is 6 m. and the height to which it reaches is about 5,000 feet, making the summit of the / ascent some 7,500 feet above Astarabad. / 99 Af \ e L PaS / ing Efh^-i-Quziuq (21J m.) and Buland lufafoh &lt;-(22 m ) the forest becomes thin and scattered, and at one m. from the summit of the pass it ceases altogether.303 Route No. I (d)—contd. At the summit of the Quzluq Pass (26 m.) the road emerges on to a plateau of rolling grass-covered and stony downs. Looking back from here a fine and extensive view is obtained of the Turkoman plain, in which the Gurgan and Atrak rivers can distinctly be seen, while in the middle distance and foreground spread the northern slopes of the Elburz mountains, covered with forests, which are now left behind and exchanged henceforth for the normal barren and rugged Persian landscape. The plateau is about 1 m. wide with a range of hills on either side running back S.-W. as if to meet the ends of the Shah Kuh Mountain, an imposing wall of snow-covered rock some 13,000 feet high, running due E. and W. about 10 m. away. The road is fairly level and follows more or less the centre of the plateau, direction being S. ; at 13 m. it passes a flat grassy valley on the W. and turns S.-E. towards a saddle-backed and sparsely wooded hill, about a mile away. The ascent of this hill and the much greater descent on the southern side is known as the Jilin Bilin Pass. Jilin Bilin Pass .—At 31 m. the summit of the Jilin Bilin Pass is reached. The ascent is about 1 m. in length and the gradient not very steep, but sufficiently so to reduce the marching speed of infantry to 2 m. per hour. The descent is abrupt and steep by a hill path, which leads into a valley about 1,000 feet below, running E. and W. and parallel to the Shah Kuh Mountain. The descent is about 1| m. in length. At the foot of the pass the road turns due E. and follows the valley into which the path has descended. The valley is about £ m. broad, and through it runs the Tangeh stream flowing W. to E.; on either side of the valley are rocky hills, barren except for a few scattered fir trees and thorn bushes. The road is very rough and stony. Haft Chasmeh.—At 371 m. is a collection of small springs immediately on the right of the road, the locality being named Haft Chasmeh. At 39 m. the valley forks into two, one valley continuing E., the other going E.-S.-E. The road follows the latter, and begins an ascent which leads to the foot of the Vishvinu Pass. Up to this point there has been a limited amount of cultiva tion in the valley; this now ceases until the Vishvinu Pass has been crossed. i. • • a9304 Route No. I {d) — contd. Vishvinu Pass .—At 40 m. the road turns to a little E. of S., and the Vishvinu Pass commences. The ascent is steep but fairly straight for half a mile, at which point the summit of the pass is reached. This is the highest point attained on the journey, being about 8,500 feet, and it completes the crossing of the Elburz mountains • the remainder of the route leads downhill to Shahrud. The descent of the pass is very steep and rough by a path down the face of a razor-backed spur, into a narrow valley running E. to a little E. of S., flanked by rugged barren hills. ° The total length of the descent is about 24 m. the first mile being the steepest. ’’ The descent culminates in the bed of the Utgar stream the general line of which the road follows for the rest of the journey • in many places the road is actually the stream bed. J ' Task.—At 45 m. Tash is passed about £ m. E. of the road which continues down the valley to a collection of caravansanns, known as Taj ar, at 49. m. Here the vaUey begins to broaden out; the hills around are barren except for small bushes and scrub. At 49J m. there comes into view a long snow-crowned rockv mountain called Mount Mojum. At 50 m. the road turns E. and enters a broad plain covered with scrub and stones, with practically no cultivation. This plain is enclosed on the soufh- ern side by a lazor-backed hill known as Mount Van which gradually joins up with Mount Mojum. T J e s ' rfa ce of the road here is rough and stony, but is pass- and tactor J^iot passable for heavy lorries ‘—a 1 ' ***« a- From here the hills on the N. side of the road which are XtorpZi^' away to the N., 1 g^vhlg -d is E. and .nc“ p 7 p ^randTiU 0 ow“ ^ 1 “• * **308 2?ote .—Passes closed by snow, December, January and February.309 *s6 s s3 £-3? i -j '£i! *el ;5P flfcSP /.S&lt; *5' to p . .2„ : » 5 ; 5'3 0if Route ISTo. I {d)—contd. {c)^Outstanding Physical Features .—Between Astarafcad and Shahrud there are three outstanding physical features, i.e., the Quzluq Pass, the Jilin Bilin Pass, and the Vishvinu Pass. These passes are normally closed by snow during December, January and February. 1. The Quzluq Pass .—Is not a pass in the ordinary sense of the word. *What is known as the Quzluq Pass is only the first section, from the Astarabad side, of a pass 66 miles long by which the crossing of the Elburz Mountains between Astarabad and Shahrud is effected. 'W hat the Quzluq Pass achieves is merely the ascent of the northern face of the mountains. This ascent is effected by a zigzag path up the face of a steep narrow isolated spur, the total length of the zigzag being about 6 m., the ascent from the foot of the pass being about 5,000 feet. At Gardan-i-Quzluq, the foot of the Quzluq spur, the pass commences. It is a path, in some places cut, but in most merely worn, in the face of the hill. The gradient is exceedingly steep, the path for the most part only about 2 feet wide, and the surface very rough, varying from loose soil to large boulders and rocks. On an average each zigzag is about 40 yards long, and forms a sharp angle with the ones below and above it. For the first 1-| m. the ascent is through thick forest. The slopes of the side of the spur are sheer, and divergence from the path by equipped troops with a view to attacking may be considered an impossibility. At ! | m. two houses and a caravansarai are passed, the whole being known as Robat-i-Quzluq, and £ m. further up lies Buland Sufalieh where there is an open grassy plateau 250 yards by 60 yards forming an excellent camping ground and a good defensive position. There are springs of good clean water at Robat-i-Quzluq and Buland Sufalieh. From Buland Sufalieh the trees become much thinner, and 3 m. above it cease altogether. About 1 m. from the summit there is a stretch of | a mile where the path is practically level, after v/hich a miserable tea house and stable are reached named Dimiloh, where there is a310 \ Koute No. I (d)—contd. good spring and from where J m. of as steep a gradient as any of the previous ones leads to the summit of the pass. Here the road flattens out on a plateau of rolling grassy downs, strewn with stones of all sizes. Looking north, a magnificent view is obtained. To troops carrying full equipment the march would be most trying and exhausting, and it is doubtful if as much as 1J m. per hour marching speed would be obtained. The gradient the whole way is very steep, the only flat stretch being the i m. of level path about ^ m. below the summit of the pass. The pass is dealt with from a tactical point of view in para graph 14. 2. The Jilin Bilin Pass .—The road leads over a ridge of low hills enclosing the southern end of the plateau traversed after completing the ascent of the Quzluq. The distance from the summit of the Quzluq to the northern foot of the Jilin Bilin Pass is 4 m. The ascent on the northern side is one m. long ; the gradient would reduce marching speed of infantry to 2 m. per hour ; the surface of the road is rough and stony, but passable up to the summit of the pass for field guns, Ford vans and carts. The general direction is S.-S.-E. The road is fairly straight until m. from the summit, where it zig zags. On either side are low sparsely wooded hills, and to the S.-W. are the Shah Kuh moun- ^ tains. The descent is very steep by a zig zag path between one and two feet wide ; the surface is rough'and in many places loose ; it is impassable for wheeled transport. In some places the pass has been revetted by natives with brushwood and scrub. About £ m. from the foot of the pass the path turns due E. (along the valley seen from the summit), and the gradient becomes more gradual. The descent is flanked by steep barren hills, and faced by a rocky ridge which forme the southern side of the valley into which the path leads. The total length of the descent is 14 m. 3. The VisJwinu Pass.—Completes the task of crossing the Elburz Mountains. Its general direction is S.-S.-E. It chmbsRoute No. I (d) — contd. out of the valley entered by the Jilin Bilin Pass over a ridge of barren hills into the Tash valley. From its summit commences the downhill journey which leads out of the mountains to Shah- rud. The ascent is about £ m. long and is straight except for one zigzag. The surface of the road is rough, stony, and impassable for wheels ; the gradient is steep enough to reduce marching speed of infantry to 2 m. per hour. The descent is very rough and steep by a narrow zigzag path along the sides and face of a razor-edged spur. The total length of the descent is about 2£ m., the first m. being the steepest. The pass ends in the bed of the stream in the valley, along which the road continues to Tash, about 3 m. away. On either side of the descent signs of coal are manifest on the hills and near the edges of the path itself. The route from Astarabad to Shahrud does not pass through any particularly unhealthy locality. (d) Possible halting places in cases of stages exceeding 18 m .—• There is only one stage exceeding 18 m., the 5th and the last one, from Tash to Shahrud. Possible intermediate halting places in this stage are :—(a) Amirieh, 15 m. from Tash, and (6) Tajar, 18 m. from Shahrud. (a) Could be used as an intermediate halting place when pro ceeding from Tash to Shahrud, and (&amp;) when marching from Shahrud to Tash. Details regarding water and camping grounds in these two places are given in paragraphs 2 and 9. 2. Drinking water .—Drinking water throughout the route is plentiful for men and animals. The quality is good. At a rough estimate, the quantity is sufficient to supply an infantry brigade operating on the road at any season. For human con sumption the water is from springs. For animals between 6 m. from Astarabad and the summit of the Quzluq Pass, mainly from springs and streams, by bucket. From the summit of Quzluq Pass to Shahrud, direct from streams. The supply is permanent, and always drinkable. At one of the stages the water is brackish. No gear beyond buckets is necessary for the Watering pf nimals. .. . .3r2 Eoute No. I (d)—contd. Water is least plentiful at Buland Sufalleh, where there is one spring onlyk There is, however, another spring | m. further, down the Quduq Pass at Robat-i-Quzluq. Animals could be watered. direct from the latter spring. 3. Supplies .—-Throughout the route supplies are not plenti ful nor easily obtainable. Exclusive of Shahrud and Astarabad supplies are only obtainable at (a) Khairat (11 m. from Astarabad-), (b) Varah springs, 30 m. from Astarabad, and (c) Tash. ,. , ... .. s,' ri ' &gt; At (re) they have to be sent for to villages out in the forest, anything up to 4 m. away, and at (b) they have to be sent for to Shah Kirh village, about 8 m. distant. Should the local inhabitants be hostile, collection of supplies at'these places would be consequently a matter of difficulty. At all three above mentioned places the following supplies are available :—- r, Rice, atta, barley, oats, dhal, straw, sheep and goats. Potatoes and vegetables are not generally available, and sugar can practically never be procured ; cattle are scarce. Of the supplies shown as available, 3 days’ supply for 1 Indian battalion and 200 animals could be collected at anv of the three places mentioned within two days provided the inhabitants were friendly. Exclusive of Astarabad and Shahrud there are no bazaars where stores, etc., can be procured. At Astarabad and Shahrud sufficient supplies of all kinds can be obtained to maintain an infantry brigade and 000 animals indefinitely. 4. 7Va?wporif.-rr,OdMection of local transport from September to March is difficult, as it is then scattered about the mountain paths carrying loads. In the spring, however, the villagers con centrate their animals, and use them until the beginning of autumn for agricultural work. It is probable that in 3 day's the following approximate numbers of ponies and mules could be collected, provided the inhabitants were friendly and the local officials assisted . ■ -&gt; ■ At Astarabad .. .. .. At Khairat (from outlying village i) At. Task At Shahrud ., Ponies and mules. 600 100 100 ' 600Route No. I (d) ~contd. These figures may be taken as low estimates. All would be pack animals. No vehicles are available anywhere except at iShahrud, where four or five post fourgons might be obtained. 5. Fuel. Between Astarabad and Buland Sufalieh, wood from the forest is unlimited and of very fair quality. Between Buland Sufalieh and Shahrud fuel is unobtainable in any quantity. 6. Grazing .—Grazing for horses and cattle on the route is scarce except between Astarabad and Buland Sufalieh, where it is available from mid-March to mid-June. Between these two places and during the months mentioned there is : probably sufficient grazing for 600 animals., The grass is of good quality. 7. Obstacles .—The only obstacles met with between Astara- bafi arid Shahrud are the three passes already mentioned, and also the heavy ground between Astarabad and Gardan-i-Quzluq (20 miles). To minimize the obstruction presented by these passes and make them fit for wheeled transport would necessitate the employment of skilled labour, as the tracks would have to be entirely regraded ; the expense and labour involved would be prohibitive. ^ The heavy going referred to above occurs where the road goes through the forest to the foot of Qrizluq Pass. The worst places could be improved by using logs of wood from the forest, but as this would work out at about 6 m. of road to be done, doing only the Worst places, it would take considerable time and labour to accomplish. This “ heavy going ” is not permanent; it occurs only after heavy rain. When after such rain the ground has dried up, the going is not difficult for men or animals. 8. Additional Work necessary .-—No extra work is required to snake the route passable for details as shown in 1 (a). See table under paragraph 1 (h) for other work necessary. 9. Camping graand—Throughout t)jfe route camping grourids are'numerous for a force of about 1,000 men and 500 animals. At Astarabad, Khairat, Varah Springs (30 m. front Astarabad) and Shahrud, there are camping grounds sufficient for an infantry or cavalry brigade. Between Varah Springs exclusive and Shahrud inclusive the camping grounds are stony. None of the camping .grounds are314 Route No. I (d) — contd. normally subject to floods, except one situated 3| m. from Astarabad, which is liable to flood in the winter. Details of camping grounds are given in the stages in which they occur. 10. Communications. —Very few routes join and none cross the route from Astarabad to Shahrud by the Quzluq Pass. The main routes joining are :— (1) Road to Shah Kuh village, which, passing through this village, rejoins the main road at 1 m. S. of Tash. This is an alternative route to Shahrud, avoiding the Jilin Bilin and Vishvinu Passes. It is 20 m. longer than the route by these passes : it is passable for infantry and pack transport only. (2) Path from southern foot of Jilin Bilin Pass climbing over a ridge of rocky hills to Tash, thereby avoiding the Vishvinu Pass. This path is said to be very rough and steep, and to be traversed by pack animals only with considerable difficulty : it is a worse road than the Vishvinu Pass. (3) From Amlrieh (or Kazateh', to Bustam (4 m.) ; the road goes over Bustam plain and is said to be fit for wheeled transport. Telegraph. —-There is a telegraph office at Astarabad, Tash and Shahrud. 11. Inhabitants. —Between Astarabad and Shahrud by the Quzluq road the neighbourhood is very thinly populated, and habitations are few and far between. What inhabitants there are are Persians ; in April 1920 their attitude was friendly. 12. Climate. —In the Astarabad-Gardan-i-Quzluq section the climate is roughly as follows :— Summer .—-June, July, August, half September. Very hot with damp heat; hot wind from Turkoman plain. Generally unhealthy and relaxing. B Autumn.—¥LdM September, October, half November. Mild and pleasant, much r|dn. Winter. —Half November, December, January, February. Very cold and damp. Spring .—March, April, May. Mild, pleasant and healthy. In the Gardan-i-Quzlu —Shahrud Section. Summer .—Warm but never unpleasantly hot. Autumn. —Cold. Winter. —Intensely cold with biting winds and heavy snow.Route No. I (d)—contd. Spring .—Mild with cold nights. 13. Rain and Floods .—Heavy rain is likely to occur during the autumn (see above). The section of the road chiefly affected by this is that running through the forest, i.e., Astarabad to Gardan-i - Quzluq. Heavy rain makes this section of the road in most places a quagmire, and, although it remains passable for men and animals, it can only be traversed by them with great difficulty and dis comfort and at a much reduced rate of marching, probably about 2 m. per hour. The soil for the remainder of the road is more gravelly and consequently not so seriously affected by rain. Normally no section of the road becomes flooded. 14. Taotical .—To oppose an enemy advancing from Astarabad on Shahrud via the Quzluq Pass there are three positions. They are as under :—• (1) The Quzluq Pass. (2) The Jilin Bilin Pass. (3) The Vishvinu Pass. There are no positions between Astarabad and Robat-i- Quzluq suitable for defence, and once driven from Astarabad, a force would have to withdraw to the Quzluq Pass, without making another stand, should that be the line of retreat selected. (i) The Quzluq Pass .—The Quzluq Pass is naturally im mensely strong. In depth the position is 4| m. At its broadest part (the summit of the pass) it has a front of 1| m. The attackers have only one line of attack which is via the pass itself. Divergence by an attacking force into the precipitous forest- covered hills on either flank could only lead to disorganization, insuperable supply difficulties, and exhaustion. Probably the best way to hold the position would be piquets from Robat-i-Quzluq inclusive echeloned up the pass to the sum mit where the main position would be. For the defence there are countless well concealed mountain-gun positions, both in and well in advance of the main position, together with unlimited facilities for extensive and good observation, while the attackers would find it hard, if not impossible, to bring any guns into action during their attack on Robat-i-Quzluq. Their facilities for observation would be practically nil.316 Route No. I (d) — contd. Owing to the zigzag nature of the pass it can be subjected by the defence to enfilade and cross fire practically the whole way from Robat-i-Quzluq to the summit. The position is of such strength that it should be impossible for any force operating in this vicinity—and therefore equipped with mountain artillery only—to break through and capture the summit of the pass if opposed by a determined defence. The Quzluq position could be turned by an advance through Ziarat, or by advancing via Katid, Fidarisk and Zaramgul. The Ziarat road runs on an average 9 m. W. of the Quzluq, and is reported to be even more difficult. The Fidarisk route entails a very long detour. To protect Shahrud from an attack from the Astarabad direction all three routes would have to be held. The following force should be sufficient to hold the Quzluq Pass position 2 Battalions, Infantry. 2 Sections, Machine Gun Company. 1 Mountain Battery. The above is estimated to be the maximum force required. (u) The Jilin Bilin —unlike the Quzluq—is not a strong defensive position ; it forms, however, a good rearguard position, some 8 m. in rear of the Quzluq. It is commanded by hills on both flanks from 1,500 to 1,600 yards away. The field of fire is sufficiently good to make the enemy deploy out to these hills rather than push home a frontal attack. The communications in rear of the position are bad, consist ing of the narrow steep pass ; good gun positions for a rearguard fight are numerous, and observation is good throughout. lor the attackers good gun positions are many, observation good, but communications in rear are bad and difficult, the only Tine of Communication being by the Quzluq Pass. The best line of attack is probably to deploy in to the hills and drive in the defenders’ right (the weaker) flank, at the same time holding the centre and left. (m) The Vishvinu position .—The Vishvinu position is similar to that at Jilin Bilin. It is a good rearguard but not a strong defensive position. Communications, both lateral and in rear, are bad. While holding this postion detachments would have to be placed on the short cuts from the foot of the Jilin Bilin Pass and Sotu Robar to Tash (see Stage 4).-Route No. I (d).—contd. Between the Vishvinu and Shahrud there sive or rearguard positions. are no good defen- 5 m n ay ’ however ’ reasonably be taken that with the capture of the Quzluq position the fall of Shahrud is assured, and it is doubt- ful it a force which has lost consecutively the Quzluq, Jilin Bilin * « • 1115 P os ! tlons would be morally or numerically capable ot ottering any serious resistance on the open and exposed ground existing between Tash and Shahrud. t 15- A }ternatwe Alternative routes from Astarabad to Shahrud are (?,) from Astarabad through Zlarat and Shah Kuh This road joins the Quzluq road 1 m. S. of Tash, (ii) from Astarabad through Nau Deh, Fidarisk, Zaramgul, Abr, and Bustam. (1) The first route is about 8 m. shorter than the road viat\\Q Quzluq Pass ; it is very rough and comprises a continuous series of ascents and descents until Duab is reached, where the road joins with that from Quzluq. Supplies of rice, atta, barley, oats, straw, dhall, sheep and goats are available at Shah Kuh and Ziarat in limited quantities, but no reliable information is obtain able as to the amount available at Ziarat. (For Shah Kuh see paragraph 3, Supplies, above.) Drinking water plentiful from springs. Ko reliable information was obtainable regarding camping grounds, but they are likely to be few on this route. . This road ^ more difficult than the Quzluq road and is impassable for everything except men and pack animals. (2) The route via Fidarisk is not normally used by local inhabitants on account of its length ; it is about 20 m. longer than the Quzluq route and very little reliable information about it was obtainable. It was, however, generally reported to be easy, with only one pass between Zaramgul and Abr. The opinion of the Govern or and Russian Officers in Astarabad was that a force advancing from the N. to attack Shahrud would use this road. The road is probably fit for field guns at least as far aa Fidarisk. Camping grounds are said to be numerous and water plenti* ful, and it is said that a greater quantity of supplies is obtainable on this than on the Quzluq road.318 Route No. I (d) — contd* No. of stage and total distance. Details. 1 KlfAfl’AT . .. 11m. Leaving Astarabad ll rn. by the Bustam or Shahrud Gate, the road turns E. parallel to the mountains, and crossing open fields for J of a mile and a small stream, it enters a jungle of thick thorn and sparsely scattered trees. At 1 m. a cutting, at its deepest about 10 feet, takes the road down to a stream 9 feet wide and 3 inches deep, which is almost always dry. At 2 m. there is a dilapidated road guard house, where the road descends to 3J m. by a gradual gradient into a valley. About i m. from the S. side of the road is the edge of the forests at the foot of the Elburz Mountains, while N. of the road the ground descends gradually to the Sahara plain, on which Turkoman encampments and villages can distinctly be seen. At 2f m. about 100 yards S. of the road is a clear spring bubbling out of the ground. Good water all the year round. Combined with other smaller springs in the vicinity this should give sufficient water for men and animals of an infantry brigade. Animals water direct from stream formed by the spring. At .31 m. the thorns cease, and a line of canals is crossed. These canals are about 20 feet deep, with a shaft about 15 inches in diameter. Getting water from them in any quantity without pumps would be a difficult, laborious and lengthy process. Ovsineh village—about 100 houses—is m. N. of this point, the red tiled roofs of the houses being just visible through the trees surrounding it. At 3f m. there is a stream and small tea house, the locality being named Pul Ghalaman. The stream is crossed by a culvert of stone, which requires repair. [See paragraph 6 (1) below.] The surface of the road up to this point is rough, being broken ,up by mud patches and inundations made by small streams, flo wing in the winter. A. T. carts, Ford vans and field guns would experience no difficulty in negotiating the road up to this point in dry weather. In wet weather it would probably be impassable for Ford vans.Route No. I (d)—contd. From Pul Ghalaman to 4 m. the road passes between thorn fences enclosing cultivated fields ; its surface is smooth. The village of Nasrabad at 4 m. is situated J m. N. of the road, which now enters dense thorn, and becomes narrow with an uneven surface. Infantry would have to march in file and cut thorn bushes from the sides of the road to make it broad enough for field guns and cars. At 41 m. the thorn ends, and the road passes through open fields on the N. of the route, and wooded foothills on the S. of it, the woods coming down to within m. of the road. At m. 6 a copse is entered and a stream crossed. This copse is the beginning of the forest through which the road runs to the Quzluq Pass. The stream is 3 feet wide and about 1 foot deep, and is for the next 12 m. crossed and recrossed several times. Here it is bridged by a small wooden culvert which requires repair [see paragraph 6 (2) below]. In its present state it is temporarily passable for field guns. A path leading to Nasrabad joins the road here; there ia a road guard house at the junction. The road for the rest of the stage is bordered by thick jungle and forest, and except for a few glades and clearings, observation seldom exceeds 10 yards on either side. At 6] m. the road turns S-E. and the surface is very rough, being for the most part composed of dried mud. It descends into and crosses the bed of the Robar stream v/hich is 18 feet wide with banks 10 feet high, through which the road penetrates by cuttings. It was dry in April, 1920. At 6§ m. a stream is forded ; it was 4 feet wide and 6 inches deep in April. The right bank of the Robar stream is then reached. The river bed is sunk 30 feet with sheer banks. At 7 m. a spring of clear water crosses the road from the forest. Good water all the year round. Sufficient for 1 battalion with animals. At m. a stream 6 feet wide and 6 inches deep (in April) has to be forded. The ford has a stony bottom and forms no obstacle. At 7f m. a stream 2 feet wide and 3 inches deep (in April) is forded. At 8 m. the road becomes covered with pebbles of all sizes and at 8£ xru large boulders are encountered which would have320 Route No. I (d) — contd. to be removed to allow wheels to pass. 3 [See paragraph 6 below.] At 8.| m. the road is crossed by a track leading to the N.- E. to Jelen, a village of about 50 houses 4 m. distant, and to the S. to bfaumur, a village of 45 houses about 2 m. distant. At 9 m. the road goes through a clearing and crosses the dry bed of a stream—no obstacle. At 9[ m. there is a very stony patch requiring work to make it tit for wheels. [See paragraph 6 (5) below.] At 10J m. the road enters a long, narrow and grassy glade, which in turn leads into an open meadow, and thence into a second narrow glade. This forms an excellent camping place for an infantry or cavalry brigade. Along either side of the meadow at 11 m. runs a good stream. The water from these is good but muddy in March, April and May on account of snow water. Their flow is perennial. Supply is sufficient for an infantry or cavalry brigade. Animals are watered by buckets or direct from the stream in a few places. There is a road guard house here. The locality is known as Khairat. 1. Drinking Water. —Good drinking water is plentiful at frequent intervals during the stage. All streams and springs are perennial (except those specially noted). The main streams and springs in this stage are {a) 2f m., (b) 7 m., and (c) 11 m.—Khairat. 2. Supplies. —As far as 6 m. from Astarabad the following supplies in a normal year can be obtained all the year round in sufficient quantities to maintain an infantry or cavalry brigade indefinitely, provided the inhabitants are friendly :—Wheat, barley/oats, straw, flour, salt, dhal, fruit, butter, firewood, sheep and goats, potatoes and onions. Sugar is scarce and very expensive (5 Krdns per pound in April, 1920). Between 6 m, and Khairat no supplies are obtainable on the road. At Khairat itself no supplies are available, but they can be obtained by sending out to villages up to 4 m. distant in the forest. The same items are obtainable from these outlying villages as enumerated for Astarabad. With the active assistance of the local inhabitants, probably sufficient for an infantry brigade for one week could be collected in three days.Route No. I(d).~contd. 3. Transport -—Pony and mule transport is available each S e v 3,o^ U l: 300 ?

The locality is named Jo vseyalleh. At 5J m. a large open meadow named Garm-Ab-Dasht is reached. 2 The name is taken on account of a spring running on the S. side of the meadow. This spring is icy cold in summer and hot in winter. There is camping space here for 2 battalions. From 6-£ to 61m. the road is very stony and requires work to make it passable for wheels [see paragraph 7 (g) below]. At 6! m. the road descends into a small ravine £ m. long. The road In re travels almost level with the Dehaneh stream. It is too narrow for guns [see paragraph 7 {h) below]. The country now begins to assume a more rugged appearance. On the N.-E.

Here the road turns a little W. of S. with a gradient sufficient to reduce the marching speed of infantry to 2J m per hour and it becomes merely a collection of large stones and boulders, and is quite impassable for wheels for the rest of the stage. At 9 m. is a glen, faced by the foot of a huge forest-covered spur, and on the face of it is seen a path, climbing at a very steep angle into the trees. This is the commencement of the Quzluq Pass. The locality is known as Gardan-i-Quzluq . The ascent of the pass then begins. The gradient is exceed ingly steep, and the path zigs zags at sharp angles about every 40 j’-ards.

Passability .—From the summit of the pass to Varah the road is fairly level, and, though stony, it is in its present state passable for field guns, Ford vans and carts. 1. General .—Although this stage is only 8 m. long, it is a very trying march, owing to the steepness and roughness of the Quzluq Pass. The path ascends by zig-zags, the total distance from the foot of the pass to the summit being 6 m. Looking back (N.) from the summit, a splendid view is obtained of the Sahara or Turkoman plain, over a foreground of forest-covered snow-capped mountains. The Gurgan and Atrak rivers can distinctly be seen through field glasses. Looking S. the foreground contains a plateau of rolling treeless downs, with a range of thinly wooded hills on either side running back S.-W. to meet the ends of the imposing snow- covered Shah Kuh mountain, about 13,000 feet, which runs almost due E. and W. On leaving Buland Sufalieh the zig zag up the face of the Quzluq spur continues. The path is narrow and rocky, and the gradient very steep. Trees on either side of the path cease, and328 Route No. I (d )— contd. on the neighbouring spurs and hills become thinner. The forest zone now ends. At SJ m. there is a small dilapidated tea house and stable and near by a spring of good clear water. This locality is known as Dimiloh. At 4 m. the summit of the pass is reached, and the road becomes a broad track running between downs covered with grass and stones. At m. is a caravansarai named Robat-i-Safid. Here a good spring exists, which flows alongside the road for 1^ m. At Robat-i-Safid and along the road as far as the conclusion of the stage there exist numerous camping places on an average large enough for a battalion. . At 8 mile \ arah Springs are reached, and the plateau of downs through which the road has been passing S.-S.-E. ends in a grassy valley running a little W. of S. Due S. about 8 miles distant is the rocky snow-covered Shah Kuh mountain. Varah Springs known to the local inhabitants as li Varah,” or Varah Chashmeh ” is merely a collection of springs about 200 yards off the road to the W. Although at first sight it appeal’s that there are unlimited and ideal camping grounds in this place, examination shows that most of the ground is very damp owing to the existence of innumerable springs. There is however a good grassy camping ground sufficient for 1 battalion. At Varah Springs the road is joined by a path which goes S. to the village of Shah Kuh about 40 houses—8 m. away. Shahrud can be reached from here via Shah Kuh but going that way is 20 m. longer than by the Jilin Bilin Pass. There are no inhabitants at Varah Springs. 2. Drinking water. Of good quality and in unlimited quanti ty is availableAt Dimiloh, Robat-i-Safid, and Varah at all seasons. 3. Supplies.So supplies are available in this stage. They are obtainable in limited quantities at Shah Kuh, 8 m. from aiai . Proba,b]y from Shah Kuh sufficient barley, oats, straw, w eat, flour (coarse), dhal, and sheep or goats to last a battalion (Indian) for 3 days could be collected in one day. Potatoes, onions, sugar, and fruit are normally not obtainable 4. Transport. Apart from Shah Kuh where possibly about 50 ponies might be collected no transport is obtainable in this stage. 5. Pwe/.—None obtainable.Route No. I {d)—contd. camping grounds are under snow in December, January, and T ebruary, and possibly later. 8. 6 ommiimcaiions .—The single telegraph line follows the road throughout the stage. Except at Varah, where the Shah ivuh road joins, no other routes connect. Dimi!. '^ iafr ^' anls ' ;N°ne except about 5 persons (in April) at 10. CTfmate.—Summer pleasantly warm.

Would make the section from the summit of the pass to Varah impassable for Ford vans, but it would remain passable for field guns and carts. . Tactical. The Quzluq Pass is dealt with from a tactical point of view in the Epitome. pack transport only. Immediately on leaving Varah the road begins the ascent of the Jilin Bilin Pass. The ascent is fairly straight, except for a zig zag about a quarter of a mile from the summit of the pass. The total ascent on the northern side is 1 m. in length. The road as far as the summit is passable for field guns, Ford cars and A. T. carts. The gradient is steep and wheeled transport should carry only f normal load when ascending it. Marching speed of infantry would be reduced to about 2|- m. per hour. At 1 m., the summit of the pass is reached, and the descent begins down the side of the rugged hill on which grow a few scat tered fir trees. The, path by which the descent is made is very narrow, winding and steep; it is absolutely impassable for 4 TA8H 15 m. Except where other- 45 TO. wise mentioned, this stage is passable for330 Route No. 1(d) — contd. wheeled transport owing to the steepness of the gradient and the narrowness of the pass, the surface of which is composed of loose soil and rocks. The bearing of the descent is approximately S.; from the summit is seen the bottom of a valley running E. and W. at right angles to the descent. A few patches of cultivation are to be seen in the small section of the valley which is visible, about 1,000 feet below. At 2J m. the path turns E. parallel to the Shah Kuh Moun tain which is now invisible, and at 2| m. it enters the valley, in which a stream runs named the Tangeh; this stream flows from E. to W. in a stony bed and averaged about 9 feet wide by 6 inches deep in April. The water in April was muddy on account of melted snow ; it contains water at all seasons of the year. The road continues in the valley on the right bank of the stream for the remainder of the stage : it is fairly level, very rough and stony, and passable for pack only. At the point where the pass enters the valley, a track leads in a westerly direction to Shah Ivuh village, 6 m. distant, and another in a southerly direction crosses the ridge of hills forming the southern side of the valley, to Tash. This latter track is exceedingly rough and steep, and is a short cut to Tash used by predestrians and^ not normally by pack transport, though it is passable for pack animals with diffipulty. The distance to Tash by this short cut from the foot of the Jilin Bilin Pass is about 8 m. There is a caravansarai where the pass enters the valley. At 3J m. a caravansarai is situated on the left of the' road, and at 4 m. there is a scattered village of about 20 houses named Sotu Robar. A mountain path takes off from here over the hills to Tash, only passable for pack with difficulty. The Tangeh is forded here and again a -J- m. further on ; the fords have stony bottoms and present no obstacle. Up to 5 m. the valley is about 1 m. wide; but at 5 m. it narrows to a width of m. At 7 m. by a short ascent and descent a spur is crossed, the gradients affording no obstacle, and at 7|m. Haft Chashmeh is reached. This is a collection of small springs on a stretch of grass; the water here is good all the year round and sufficient for one battalion. No camping ground is available as the ground is waterlogged.Route No. J(d)—contd. At 8 m. there is a caravansarai, and the valley opens out into a cup about 1 mile in diameter. At 9 m. the road fords the stream, and turning E.-S.-E. commences the ascent which leads to the foot of the Vishvinu Pass. Up to here there has been a very limited amount of culti vation in the valley : this now ceases altogether. At 10 m. the road swings a little E. of S. and the Vishvinu Pass commences. After ascending for m. by a steep gradient the summit is reached. This is the highest point attained during the march from Astarabad to Shahrud, being 8,600 feet above sea level. From the summit can be seen a valley, narrow and running approximately S.-E., flanked on both sides by steep, rugged, barren hills. The descent is very steep by means of a narrow path covered with loose soil and stones, winding sharply down the face of a razor-edged spur. The total length of the descent is about 21 m., the first mile being very steep, the remaining 1| more gradual. - he descent concluded, the road continues in the bottom of the valley, in which there is a stream named the Utgar, of similar dimensions to the Tangeh. The road in the valley is frequently merely the stream bed ; it fords the stream innumer able times. At 14 m. a track branches off to the E leading to Upper Tash, about 1|- m. distant. At 15 m. Tash is reached, on the E. side of the road, a village of about 150 houses, divided into two parts—Upper and Lower Tash, Upper Tash is about f- m. E.-N.-E. of Lower Tash. Lower lash contains the telegraph office but no shops ; it is connected to Upper Tash, where there are 3 small shops, by a path across the fields. 1. Drinking water .—Water plentiful throughout the route except during March, April and May when the Utgar and Tangeh streams are very muddy from melting snow. There is always good water at Haft Chasmeh. At Tash there is sufficient good water all the year round for one battalion. 2. Supplies .—Available at Tash. Rice, flour, barley, wheat, oats, dhal, potatoes. Probably in one day sufficient of these might be collected for one battalion for 3 days. Sheep and goats are available only in very small numbers. Sugar not obtainable.332 Route No. I {d) — contd. Almonds and raisins obtainable, as are also grapes, the latter only during July, August and part of September. 3. Transport. —During the summer months about 150 ponies might be collected in 2 days. In winter months about 50 in 6 days. 4. Fuel. —None available. From the summit of the Vishvinu Pass to Tash there are many places near the road where signs of coal are very evident. About 4 m. E. of Tash there are some small coal mines made by the Russians some years ago, and now disused. 4. Grazing. —Nil. 5. Camping Grounds. —There is only one camping ground in this stage, and that is at Tash, where there is room for one battalion, in open spaces S. and W. of the lower village. The ■camp would have to be scattered. The ground is stony. 6. Climate. —Winter intensely cold. Spring, days cool, nights •cold. Summer, day warm and very frequently a strong wind blows, enveloping the place in dust. Autumn, day cold, night very cold. 7. Rain. —Heavy and continuous rain makes the Vishvinu Pass impassable. The road is closed by snow during December, January and February. 8. Tactical. —Vishvinu Pass is dealt with tactically in the Epitome. 5 SHAHRUD .. 21m. 66 66 m. On leaving Tash the general direction is S.-E. The road is very rough and stony and continues down the valley. . ^t | m. Duab is reached, a caravansarai and about 5 houses situated at the junction of a valley running W. to E. with the valley down which leads the Shahrud road. ^Here this road is joined by the one leading from Astarabad via Ziarat and Shah Kwh. At 24 m. the hills of the valley close in to a small defile ehrough which both the road and a stream pass. The hills on tither side at this point are of red earth and rock, and are barren except for a little scrub and a few fir trees. At 4 m. Ta jar is reached. Here there are three caravansarais each about £ m. apart, and each standing in a small grove ofRoute No. I (d) — contd. willow and poplar trees. Camping space is sufficient here for 2 battalions. Water is obtained from a spring near the centre caravansarai, and also from the stream when not muddy from snow water. No supplies are obtainable. The valley now begins to broa den out. Leaving Tajar the road crosses the bed of the stream diagonal ly, ascending out of it by a gradual gradient on to a broad spur. Here a range of rocky snow-capped mountains comes into view to the S.-W. about 10 m. distant. The highest in the range is named Mount Mojum. At 4-v,- m. two caravansarai-s are passed ; one named Garov is in ruins and was demolished by a flood m 1918 or 1919. At 5 m. the descent of the S. side of the spur which was ascended after leaving Tajar commences ; ahead is seen a broad very sparsely cultivated plain, enclosed on the southern side by a long low ridge of rock, named Mount Van. At this point the road becomes passable for wheels as shewn in Epitome, paragraph l (b). At 5-| m. a road takes off to the E. leading to Nikarbend a village of about 50 houses, 8 m. distant. At 9 m. a small domed stone shelter is passed. At 1QJ m. a track leaves the Shahrud road crosses the stream, now about 100 yards to the right of the road, and continue, W. leading to the village of Moium, about 10 m. distant. The Shahrud road here turns E. At 11 m. a cluster of about 10 houses in a grove of trees £ m. S. of the road is passed : this village is named Ghaleh. At 12 m. Muhammadabad is reached'—a caravansarai and half a dozen houses in a small grove of poplars and willows. There is here an excellent stream of spring water 3 feet wide and 8 inches deep in April, flowing swiftly into canals made close to the road. The source of this spring is said to be about 2 m. S. of Muhammadafcad in the hills. Here the hills on the N. side of the road begin falling away to the N.-E. From Muhammadabad the road continues E. and at 14|- m. a large grove of trees is passed, within a walled garden. A fine stream of clear water flows all the year round past this point into t e Bustam plain, which itself begins here. At this point the stream which has accompanied the road down the334 Route No. I(d)—contd. valley from the foot of the Vishvinu Pass has been diverted from its bed for irrigation purposes, and it flows across the road in a N.-E. direction. At 15 mile the tea house of Kalateh is reached, \ m. N. of the road, a big walled garden and house, known as Amirieh. Prom here a road branches off to Bustam, about 4 m. distant E.-N.-E. The carriage road to Shahrud also commences here running between two rows of trees. This road was constructed by Amir Nizam about 30 years ago. The surface is fairly smooth and gravelly. It is passable for motor cars and light lorries in dry weather, though it would probably not be so after rain. After heavy rain it would become very sticky, but would be passable for field guns and A. T. carts. The old road continues a little S. of E. along the left bank of the bed of the stream. Its surface is very rough and stony. To the N.-E. is an open plain, hemmed in by low hills. The plain is fertile, and dotted with numerous villages surrounded by trees. It is known as the plain of Bustam. On the right of the road is the bed of the stream (dry in April), about 300 yards wide, and a ridge of barren hills about m. distant. This ridge runs E. and W. and 5 m. further on the old road crosses it, while the carriage road passes through a gap about 1 m. to the E. of the old road. Where the old road crosses is known as Nad Shakan. The carriage road continues towards a gap in the ridge of At 21 m. the walls of the most northern gardens are reached and by a turn to the right a broad avenue is entered leading to the hills ahead, and at 18 m. the trees of Bustam come distinctly into view. Three m. distant to the N.-E. from there, through the gap in the hills in front, are obtained glimpses of the trees of Shahrud. At 20 J m. a road branches off to Bustam, and the carriage road ends in the bed of the stream which continues through the break in the hills into and beyond Shahrud.Route No. l{d).~concld. onions, and sheep and goats are obtainable in sufficient quantities brigade ^ rG&lt;1Uiremont ' 3 indefinitely of at least an infantry Transport.

General. —General dire tion E. to Flruzkuh, thence N. £out 0 PtiOnOf This is the most easterly, easiest and least interesting of the routes from Tehran across the Elburz to Mazandaran and is the natural line for the construction of a metalled road to give direct access to the fertile plain of Mazandaran. See paragraph ( 5 ). It is passable throughout for cavalry, infantry, mountain artillery, pack mules and donkeys, for Ford vans to Damavand, stage 2, from 1st May to 30th November, and for camels to Duab in stage 7 ; see paragraph ( 6 ). With the exception of the Kazvin-Manjil road, which drops down from the edge of the plateau to Manjil valley and plain of Gilan, it is the only route crossing the mountains by a low and well defined pass of less than 7,000', seldom blocked by snow for more than 7 days, instead of ascending an elevated ridge of 9 , 000 ' to 10 , 000 ' liable to be blocked for several weeks.

Remarks. —Some work was done on these two stages to make the road carriageable and toll houses were built by the Persian Postal Administration in 1919. It is used by motors in dry weather, but sharp turns and short but steep ascents and descents make driving difficult. The surface .—Is gravelly and hard as far as Jajarud, stage 1. Of stage 2 to Damavand a few sections have been metalled, but for the most part little has been attempted beyond the collection of loose stones and digging of ditches on either side. Beyond Rudahind the surface is soft earth and becomes very heavy when wet. On 12th March snow was lying on both sides of the road on the Asp Char pass and it was too soft and miry for a motor to pass. Gradients .—The descent to the JajarHd is fairly steep, and a loaded Ford comes up this hill with difficulty. The ascent beyond Jajarld is easy. The gradients of the Asp Char pass are gentle on both sides. 2 Damavand Remarks .—■ Duab Cavalry, Infantry, (middle of Mountain Artillery, stage 7). Camels, Pack mules, ponies and donkeys. Surface .—To the top of the Dalchai pass, stage 4, is stony in parts but generally good. At this point the road narrows into an ordinary hill track, but the surface continues very fair. Other ascents and descents as far as Namrud in stage 5 are stony but nowhere bad. From Namrud to the summit of Firuzkuh pass the surface is excellent and horses can trot over most of it. N. of the pass it deteriorates and becomes rocky. Gradients .—As far as the pass (stage 6) none are steep except in the Dalchai section, and these are short and not severe.Route No. I (h)~contd. Surface —Below Taleh, in stage 7, stonfes and gravel give place to soft earth trodden into a series of ridges and depressions filled with mud and water. Stage 8 through the forest is strewn with great boulders and holes. These two stages are bad for any except Persian animals and are impassable for camels. Prom Shirgah to the coast, stages 9 and 10, is flat and smooth in dry weather but very boggy in wet. Gradients .-—None worthy of mention. \rf aciI i tie - S for Apodiag from irrigation ditches exist in stages 9 and 10 over the Mazandaran plain where the road can be made a quagmire.

Instate 7 above Duab a cutting along the hillside could be destroyed. ° The Asp Char pass in stage 2, the DallChal pass in stage 4, the Firu/.kuh pass in stage 6 are all between 6,GOO' and 7,000'. Ihe gradients are gentle up wide sloping valleys and are all easily crossed. In winter the cold is severe and they may be closed by snow for a few days in December, January and February. The Dali Chal stream flows down a deep and narrow defile and is the only striking physical feature on the Tehran side of the watershed. (c) Outstanding physical features. For the most part the route traverses a series of singularly uninteresting plateaux. N. of the watershed the scenery changes and the barrenness of the plateau gives place to verdure and vegetation. The narrow valley winds tortuously between lofty cliff and mountain and the view down it is everywhere limited to a short distance. Stages 8, 9, and 10 are unhealthy from 1st May to 30th August. Stage 2. Jajar id to Damavand, can be divided in two stages (d) inierme by halting at Bumahind 11|- or Riidahind 144 m. Stage diate haltin e 7, ’Abbasabad to Zirab, can be broken by a halt at TJleh, 13 m. places - Stage 9, Shirgah to Barfarfish, can be broken by a halt at ’Allabad, 10 m. 2. Drinking water .—Practically unlimited from, springs for men, and streams and rivers for animals with the exception of Ammabad, stage 4, where the supply is scanty, and a party ol more than 40 men and animals should halt at Dali Chai At344 Route No. I (h, — contd. Barfar'ish and Meshed-i-Sar, stages 9 and 10, diinking water for men is drawn from wells. No special gear for drawing water is necessary. Supplies ,—Supplies of wheat, barley, bhoosa, sheep and rice are scarcer than along other routes. Vegetables are scarce except in stages 9 and 10, and tea and sugar should be carried throughout. At Ammabad, stage 4, no supplies are obtainable, and at Dali Chal, the alternative stage, supplies for not more than 30 men and animals could be collected at 24 hours’ notice. The camvansarais in stage 1 and tea shops in stages 6 and 7 can only provide barley and fodder for mule convoys, and other supplies must be fetched from villages within 4 m. of the road. The district of Savad Kuh, between the F’ruzkuh pass and Shlrgah (stage 8), contains numerous large villages, but they are hidden from the road among the steep wooded hills to the W. Supplies for 100 men and animals could be brought down by a foraging party, sent one day in advance. In June and July, before the harvest, grain stocks run very low in these mountain villages. _ From Shirgah to the coast rice, vegetables, sheep and all dairy prouuce are abundant in autumn, winter and spring. In summer the flocks move up to the highland pastures and sup plies, except rice and vegetables, are less plentiful. Bread is scarce, as the Mazandaranfs are rice eaters, and the wheat grown in the lowlands is unwholesome and causes dizzi ness and sickness to persons not inured to it. Barley ?s of poor quality and not always obtainable as local animals are mostly rice fed, and barley bhoosr is unobtainable except in Barfarush. Unchopped rice straw, which is the local substitute, is unpala- taok to animals unaccustomed to it, and lacks nourishment. At Barfarush sufficient supplies are obtainable to maintain at least one infantry brigade indefinitely, and 1,000 animals, as further supplies of barley and bhoosa can be fetched from the hills as required. Transport.-^Pome's, are as, if not more, numerous than mules along this route. In autumn and spring convoys total- ng o0 to 100 animals are met daily throughout. In winter t ey mostly carry rice and charcoal from the lowlands for store in ighland villages N. of the passes, and in summer work from here on to Tehran.

They stumble over the rocks and holes, and the mud causes sores and swellings of the legs. Their feet and legs must be washed in clean water at the end of each stage, dried and greased The inferior quality of their rations and change of diet cause them to lose condition. Fuel. -Dry wood and some charcoal are obtainable at all villages. N. of the watershed charcoal is prepared and the suppiy of mel from the forest is unlimited. Grazing. Is excellent on the Firjzkuh plateau, stage 5, and supports very large herds from 15th April to 30th July. In stages 6 to 8 grazing is not found near the road, but from 15th April to 30th September it is good on the hills above. Tnrough stages 0 and 10 the country is always green and in winter the herds are driven down from the hills to graze along the coast. The grass is cropped very close and the animals are thm. It begins to grow quickly in March, and in April and May grazing is almost unlimited, but its quality is inferior to that of the highland pastures. This grazing lasts throughout the summer but climatic conditions and insect pests disagree with animals and local herds are all sent to the hills.346 Rotue No. I (h)—contd. Obstacles. —With the exception of the climatic conditions no formidable obstacles are encountered, as the passes and defiles are not difficult. Additional Work necessary .—No additional A\ r ork is necessary for the arms and transport detailed in paragraph (6). Stages 3 and 4 from Damavand to the top of the Dali Chal pass, 19 m. could be made passable for A. T. carts by 1,000 men working for four days. From the Dali Chal pass to Amlnabad, a distance of 8£ m., is one of the most difficult sections of the route and could not be made passable for wheels without much labour and engineering work. l 1 iom Amlnabad to the summit of the FIrfizkuh pass, a distance of 24£ m., could be made passable for A. T. carts between 1st April and 15th November by 1,000 men working for a fortnight. N. of the pass could not be made passable for whee’s except by the construction of a metalled road. This route is the easiest line for the construction of a metalled road and railway from Tehran to Mazandaran. The passes are low and the gradients easy and such a road would be more permanent than via Larljan (Main Route No. I), a route subject to landslips and scouring from the slopes of Damavand between Palur and Rahnah. To the summit of the Flruzkuh pass the only engineering difficulties encountered would be between Dali Cha! pass and AmTnabad. From Flruzkuh pass to ’Allabad the obstacles are considerable but less so than along the Kazvln-Manjil-Resht route. From Allabad to the coast, across a swampy plain with no solid fou dation and no stone, would also be a difficult section. For the foundation of the Shah Abbas causeway charcoal was employed as a substitute. Camping grounds. —Would suffice at all stages for 1,000 men and 500 animals, but damage might be caused to standing crops between March and July. At stages 1, 2, 3 and 5 very ia±ge areas are available. The Fmizkuh plateau especially affords numerous excellent sites in summer.Route No. I {h)~~contd. Communications .—- 1.

Savad Kuh, see stages 6 and 7, contains numerous villages but sitiiated at a distance from the road, and owing to the mountainous nature of the district they are difficult of access. In winter a considerable proportion of the population goes down to Mazandaran from all the hill districts, especiallv Flruz kuh. In the Mazandaran plain from Shirgah, stage 8, villages are numerous. Barfarush is the commercial centre of Mazandaran and contains about 30,000 inhabitants. Owing to the stagna tion of trade with Russia since 19:18 the population in 1920 was reckoned to have decreased by 20 per cent. A Turk! tribe, named Hadavand, live in the Varamln-Damavalid district in winter and migrate to Far in summer, when nomad encamp ments also come with flocks from Varamin to the Flruzkuh plateau.348 Route No. 1(A).- contd. The shepherd and, cowherd portion of the population of Mjizandaran is migratory, visiting the lowland and highland pastures according to the season. The hill men, kvln, or yailaqi, are strong and robust, but the plainmen, qishldqi, are sallow, under-sized, timid and suspicious of strangers. In March 1920 the people were not hostile, but were less ready to help than along other routes. Climate. —1. From Tehran to ’Abbasabad, stage 6, the climate of the Persian plateau prevails. The seasons are roughly :— Spring, half March, April, May, hal' June. Mild with cold nights. Healthy and pleasant. Hot sun makes midday marching trying in May. Rain falls at intervals and becomes heavier on nearing the watershed. Summer. —Half June, July, August. Warm but fresh. The sun is very powerful. No rain. Autumn. —September, October, half November. Resembles spring but is more bracing. Midday sun is strong until 7th October. Winter. Half November, December, January, half March. Very cold with biting winds and snow. Beyond the Jajarud valley, stage 1, as far as stage 6 the country is high, and, although in winter the cold is not so intense as on the elevated ridges traversed by the Elburz routes this road continues bleak and exposed for a much longer distance, and winter travelling along it between 1st December and 15th March is most severe. I he summer sun is powerful and glare on the plains trying, but the air is fresh. 6 2- Abbdsdbdd to Meshed-i-Sdr. —The capricious climate of the Caspian provinces prevails. Rain followed by cold may come at any season but the rainfall is less than in GTlan, and the climate generally healthier. The contrast in physique between Mazandarams who migrate to the hills in summer and those who stay m the plains is eloquent testimony to the unhealthiness of the latter at that season. The seasons are roughly :— Spring. —March, April’, May. Mild, fresh, and delightful until May, when it becomes ener- va mg. Heavy rain falls at intervals of a week or ten days followed by hne sunny weather. JRoute No. I (h)~contd. Summer .—June, July, August. . ^ ot exc ept after rain, which brings a damp cold.

During half March, April, and May, half September, October and half November the climate is propitious for travelling throughout this route, but the changes of climate between the lowland and the highland section bring out fever in many Persians and Indians. Rain and Floods .—Rain makes stages 9 and 10 very heavy going and occasionally impassable. The rice fields are flooded from May to mid-September and make movement off the road impossible. Tactical. From Dali Chai Pass to Aminabad are some strong positions. A force holding the heights above the defiles N. of Firuzkuh pass possesses a series of strong defensive positions against an enemy from the N.

Be yond Shamsabad for £ mile the surface is soft and boggy when wet. At 8 miles pass the caravansarai at Asulak. The village of Asulak (15 houses) lies £ mile S. to the right of the road.° At 10 miles pass Ab-i-Anjilak tea shop. At 11£ miles is a slight descent to a tea shop among trees on the bank of a stream and a toll gate behind it. The village of Bumahind is 1 mile upstream and provides a good camping ground and supplies. A short gradual rise from the valley is followed by another gentle drop to the Rudahind toll gate and stream at 14| miles. There is no village here but supplies could be fetched from ’Ah, at the head of the valley. This long stage can be con veniently divided into 2 by halting at Bumahind or Rudahind. The route for the Imamzadeh Hashim pass and Haraz valley of Larljan branches off to_the left between Bumahind and Ruda hind and goes through Ah. At 19 miles by Chinar teashop a more direct mule track to Firuzkuh via GiliardjSOO houses) continues N. over a hill, meet ing the loop road via Damavand 3J miles beyond Damavand. The cart road goes to Damavand, bends N.-E. up a valley and rises by very easy gradients to the Asp Char pass at 22J miles. The town lies in a hollow and the road makes an easy descent down to it. This cart road from Tehran to Damavand was completed in 1919. Beyond Jajarud it contains very little stone and would quickly be cut up by heavy traffic. From Rudahind it becomes very heavy after rain. On 12th March snow was lying on both sides of it; the Asp Char pass and the surface was too soft and muddy for a motor to pass.

From the W. is the direct route from Chinar tea-shop via Giliard. The road crosses the plain and on nearing the hills is cut up by some watercourses. At 9 miles is Aineh Varzan. It is a poor village and the fruit trees which are the chief asset in this area appear neglected. The inhabitants are not disposed to welcome strangers, and supplies for more than 25 men and animals would be obtained with difficulty. There is a spring of good water but it is suffi cient for only a small area of cultivation close below the village and the plain remains waterless and barren.

In late spring and summer when the rice fields are fiooded the remains of a Shah Abbas stone causeway must be followed. At other seasons in dry weather it is better to go through the fields. These side tracks constantly change, as the inhabitants construct their fences to suit their cultivation, regardless of any right of way. At 10 miles is ’Aliabad, a straggling village which is the centre of a fertile district and has a busy market-day. The road to Sari branches off E. from here. It is swampy in parts but less so than the Barfarush-Sarl route which becomes impassable in wet weather. At 12 miles cross the Talar river by an easy ford and continue through woods and rice fields. 10 MESHED-I-SAR •. 9 m, There is a choice of routes ; the easterly 171 m . one through Ahmad Kulah is only 7 miles but is swampy in wet weather. Near Ahmad Kulah is an open meadow one square mile in extent which would be an excellent aerodrome or camping round within 4 miles of Barfarush. The better route is 9 miles, following the right bank of the Babul river, which is 100 yards wide and 2 feet deep in spring, but dwindles to a small stream in summer. It flows down a gravel bed between high banks and its water wifi not reach the level of the surrounding land for irrigation. A stony pavement has been constructed for about 3 miles from Barfarush and a good earth track continues to Meshed-i- Sar, passing several large villages. There was much traffic along this road before the collapse of trade with Russia. ROUTE NO, I(i), From FlRUZKUH to CHASHMEH-I-’ALl. Distance 100 miles. 7 stages.

Vl (w)]* General Direction N.-N.-E. General .—This is the shortest route from Tehran to the Cas pian, but difficult and passable only in summer, when next to Main Route No. I vid Larijan it is the most used of all trans- Elburz routes and like it gives access to the W. of Mazandaran. From Tehran it crosses the Jajarud valley at Lashkarak, climbs over the Afcheh ridge, 10,000' (closed by snow from December to April) to the plateau of Ear, the Qau ridge, 11,000 (closed by snow from December to May), from Lar to the Nur valley, the Quruq, 9,000' (closed in winter), or the Kalarzamin, 8,600' (open in winter), from Nur to Kujur, whence it descends a ravine to the Caspian Coast. The gradients are all severe, the surface, except across the open grassy plateau of Lar and the plain of Kujur, indifferent to bad, and for 5 miles in stage 6 the descent is very steep and an awful maze of boulders. Scrub on the hills begins on the N. side of the Nur ridge in stage 5, but the plain of Kujiir is bare. The forest commences a few miles N. of Kujur in stage 6. and the qishld’ (lowlands) in the middle of this stage. Horseflies and mosquitoes, however, are not bad here and comparative immunity from them makes this route preferable to others; e.g., Lateral Route No. I (m) down the Chalus valley, in summer, where lowlying qiskldq aro traversed for longer distances and insect pests swarm. Supplies .—Scarce at Bastak, stage 3. «336 Boute No. 1(1) — -conld. Supplies for 200 men and animals could be obtained at Bala- deh, stage 4, and at Kujiir, at 24 hours’ notice; 1,500 men and 800 animals could be supplied at Kujiir for some weeks after the harvest from the numerous villages in the Kujur and Pul valleys, supplemented if necessary, from Kalardasht to the W. Fruits and vegetables are plentiful at Baladeh in summer; elsewhere only melons, marrows and cucumbers. In the Caspian, lowlands only rice is cultivated and the inhabitants fetch wheat for their own requirements from Kujur. A party of more than 20 men should carry flour with them, also barley if required, as local animals are rice fed. Transport. —Some 3,000 mules are said to work along this route in summer as far as Baladeh, whence they take various routes. They come from villages of hair and Kujur, e.g., Baladeh, Yalu, Yush, Kujur, each of which is said to own 200 or more mules. Grazing. —Grazing is good in Lar in stage 3 in May and June, when there is also a little grazing in stages 5 and 6. Climate. —Baladeh is semi-deserted in winter. Kujar is milder but resembles the Persian plateau in climate, and despite its proximity to the Caspian has few showers of rain in summer Communications. —1.

At foot of descent is the Jajarud river, at 10 miles, on the right bank of which is the small village of Lashkarak, where the Shah has a shooting-box. River is some 20 yards broad, and flows S. -E. to plain of Varamim It is spanned here by a stone bridge. Lashkarak might be made the halting-place for this stage.

Thence 2 miles of very steep ascent to the head of the pass, elevation 10,000 feet. The road is over rock and is very bad in places. It is practicable only for mules. From the top a descent of 1,500' leads to a stream called the' Hushkarud, a tributary of the Lar. The track zigzags down a rocky hillside, steep in many parts, but easy compared with the S. side of the pass. At the foot of the hills at 61 miles there is a small caravcinsarai called Shurhak; and at 7 miles the stream is reached. Here a track turns off eastward down the Hushkarud, reaching the main valley 7 miles farther on. The road into Mazandaian crosses the stream and, keeping to the N., goes over a low spur and then descends into an open grassy valley, sloping down to the main stream which is reached at 12' miles. Crossing the stream, the track keeps up the left bank and at 14 miles reaches the small caravansarai of Bastak, where barley and fodder for mules are obtainable. There are generally several lllat camps in the neighbourhood during the summer months, whence milk, sheep and goats can be obtained. 4 BALADEH .. .. 27 m. General direction X. (6,800'.)

Cne day’s supplies should be available at 24 hours notice for 60 men and animals at V alatru, -stage 2, and for 30 men and animals at Nisind, stage 3. In June and early July, before the harvest, atta and barley are very scarce. _ There are no other villages near these stages and further supplies would have to be fetched from distances of 10 to 20 miles. The Pul district in stage 4 is vefy productive and supplies should be available for 1,000 men and 600 animals at 2 days’ notice, reduced to 200 men and animals just before the harvest. In stage 5 no supplies are available and requirements must be carried or'-collected previously, if large, from Kalardasht, 8 miles W. or if for not more than 100 men and 100 animals from Sena, 2 miles W. on the way to Kalardasht.

From Lashkarak turn N. up the Jajarud passing the hamlet-of Hajiabad at 15 miles, Ushan (20 houses) at 17 miles to Pasham (50 houses), (marked Fashand on degree, sheet 9-M) where a tributary from the N.-W. joins the main Jajarud valley. The only steep gradient is the Quchak. The surface is fair to good throughout and camels can work up the Jajarud as far as Garmabdar Lateral Route No. I (») branches N.-W. up a side valley to Ahar from Ushan. Ffom Qulhak an alternative route goes to Shahabad and crosses the Talharz ridge, 3,300' above Qulhak and 1,800' above the Jajarud valley, to Hajiabad. The saving of about 4 miles in distance by cutting across this ridge does not compen sate for the extra climb involved, but Talharz is a fine view point for the whole of the Tehran plain. 2“ VALATRU • - .. 19 m.

During low water several of them are avoided by going a few yards along the bed of the stream. It emerges by D5rud (10 houses) at 8 miles, and passes Darbandisar tea-shop at 10 miles. Darbandisar village, 7,900', (60 houses) is opposite to it on the hillside above the left bank. The track is stony until it leaves the valley and climbs by easy zigzags to Dizin ridge 9,000'. The descent to the Laura valley is rather longer, not difficult, and the track then follows the stream to Valatru, 7,600'. The surface is average except for the bad section between Mlgun and Darbandisar. The stage can be divided by halting at Darbandisar. 3 NISIMD .. ., 19 m.

It turns from N.-W. to N.-E. up this ravine and at 2| miles climbs a rocky staircase over a spur, beyond which it is cut into the steep slopes Until the ravine widens by Varingru village (10 houses) at 4 miles. The valley bends E. at 6 miles and the track goes TO Sid i e valle - y and cIimbs fairly steeply to Sutak ridge, 10,400 , at 10 miles. It traverses an open exposed ridge to 12 miles, and makes a^steepish descent to 14 miles into an open valley under Shahzadeh Kuh, a big mass of rock on the right, which after Damavand and Takht-i-Sulaiman is the most pro minent peak in the Elburz. The stream is one of the sources of the Xur river and the track goes beside it down to Xisind, 8,300', a poor and dirty village o 50 houses near the junction of the two narrow barren valleys, one from the S. followed by the route from Varingru, one from re W. up which lies a track to Kamarbun and Duna [see Com munications (c) above]. Eastwards, down the valley, a track passes Valameh (4 miles ?) to Yush and Baladeh, the principal Villages of Nur [see Communications (&amp;)].Route No. l{m)—Gontd. The surface throughout is average, and is worst between 2 and 4 miles. Varingru is the only intermediate village. 4 KINJ ... .. 15l m. General direction N. The track goes down 72 rft, the Nur valley for 1| miles and then turns N. and climbs steeply over, loose gravel for 1*£).00 ' to Kurdu ridge, 9,800'', at 4 miles. The view N. over green slopes and woods affords a striking contrast to the desolation of the Nur valley on the S. The descent is long and steady and the surface good. The bare hillsides give place to grass and bushes, and stunted trees begin at 6£ miles; and the track enters a valley leading to Mikhsaz (350 houses), 5,500', built on the right slope above the valley at 9 miles.. One mile S, of Mikhsaz the valley forks, the branch from the S.-W. traversed by the track to Kurdu, the branch from the S.-E. by the track to Baladeh via Nijkuh, Valameh, Uz (50 houses), and Yiish [see Communications {d)\. [Lateral Route No. I (o). At 10 miles the valley expands and is very fertile. It is joined by a brook from Zanus (90 houses and large supplies), on the route to Kamarbun and Duna, If' miles distant. Munj- [8 houses) is on the left bank just above, and Khushal (20 houses), just below the junction. At 12 miles Kiya Kala (60 b.ouses) is on the left bank of the stream, opposite to Largan (150 houses),. 1J miles distant from the stream at the foot of a hill. Kinj (loO houses) is 2 miles below Kiya Kala. Below Kiya Kala the valley changes from a sloping basin with crops and fields along the stream to a level plateau adjoin ing at its northern end the Pul plain on the E., 2 to 3 miles wide and highly cultivated, through which the stream has cut a nar row, steep channel. The whole district is called Pul and com prises about 20 prosperous villages, of which Pul (400 houses) is the largest- The houses, as in Kalardasht and other highland districts of the Caspian provinces, are two-storeyed, built of logs of wocd covered with a layer of plaster, and have high pitched roofs of wooden tiles. They are more roomy and airy than the mud huts of the plateau. The villages are surrounded by huge walnut and plane trees, and the landscape of these picturesque villages-, and fertile valleys between green wooded mountains is of great beauty.376 tloUTE No. I (m)—contd. 5 HASANABAD .. 16| m.

PUL-I-ZUGHAL belbw Kinj the Mlkhsaz gi i stream is joined at 3,400' near Arsinkirud by a brook and track from Pul miles distant, and changes its direction from N. to N.-W. _ From Arsinkirud a track crosses the hills to the coast. It is more direct but the route along the valley is easier. The valley has become deep and wooded with small trees. The track keeps several hundred feet up on the hillside to the left above^the river, until it drops gradually to the Chittin stream, 2,600', at 5J miles. After a short ascent it continues along the slopes to a small plateau, 2,600', at 8 miles. Dasht Nazir (15 houses) with rice cultivation is situated about a mile to the left but is , hidden. Beyond Dasht Nazir is Firuzabad (150 houses). At this point the river makes a northerly bend, appearing to enter a gorge, and the track bears off to the left through moie open country, making a steep descent from the plateau at 2,600 to a stream at 2,150', from which it climbs to 2,o00 and drops to a brook at 2,250' at 9| miles. From 2,250' it climbs in a westerly direction up a steep ridge to 3,450' at 11| miles. The descent is at first gradual and then becomes steep through pine woods with protruding roots across the track to Hasanabad (10 houses), 1,100', at 16-|- miles, J mile from the left bank of the Pul river, which is deep, narrow, and overgrown. The track crosses rice fields to a wooden bridge over it and follows the valley down to its junction with the Chains at Pul-i- Zughal, 800', Lateral Route No. I (n). The Chalus is narrow, but swift and rocky and difficult to ford. No supplies are obtainable from theteashop, which is desert ed in summer, and supplies must be fetched from Sena (30 houses, 3 miles) or Kalanau on the road to Kalardasht. The surface through most of this stage is excellent. The total drop is nearly 3,000', and the ascents and descents of side- valleys and the ridge above Hasanabad should be avoided owing to the mosquitoes bred in the rice cultivation, and Pul-i- Zughal, which has no rice, is preferable. 6 ABRANG .. .. 17 to. ,&lt;?ee Lateral Route — ; —_ ' No. 1 («), Stage T. 108 £ m.ROUTE NO.

General. —General direction N.-N.-W. With the exception of Lateral Route No. I (i) via Nur and Kujur, this is the shortest route from Tehran to the Caspian. It is a summer route, but lies along valleys and is much easier. It goes across to the rice-producing districts of Kalaris- taq and Tunakabun and is a good deal used by mules carrying rice and charcoal to Tehran. It is the same as Lateral Route No. I (to) {q.v.) to tjshan up the Jajarud valley. It then turns N.-W. up a side valley by Ahar, stage 1, to the Aharbashm ridge, the watershed between the Jajarud and Laura [i.e., Karaj) basins, and descends to Shahr- istanak, stage2. It lies along the Laura valley to Gachisar, stage 3, and then crosses Kandavan ridge, 10,200', in stage 4, and strikes the upper valleys which form the Chalus. It crosses to the E. side of the valley at VaHabad, stage 4, and keeps above the steep slopes above the Chalus gorge until it descends by the Hazar Cham (1,000 windings) in stage 5 to the river and follows it to the coast. Vegetation begins 3 miles N. of Kandavan, and big forest N. of Pul-i-Zughal in stage 6. Gradients. —The ascent and descent of A) arbashm in stage 2 are easy. The approach to Kandavan from both sides is a steady ascent along valleys and the watershed is only 1,600' on the S., 1,000* on the N. above them ; the zigzags are steep but the climb is shorter and easier than over ridges crossed by other routes. The Hazar Cham descent is very steep. The track throughout averages 10' in width, and the surface generally is fair for an Elburz route (though rough enough378 Koute No. I (n).~cont'd. judged by any ordinary standard), and over Kandavan good and free from stones. It is boulder-strewn near Valla ad, stage 4^ and the Hazar Cham is very s,tony. Stone paving in stage 6 makes this forest section less bad then along some routes. The road from Kandavan to the sea was constructed by the Austrian Engineer Gasteiger for Nasir-ud-Din Shah, whose favourite hunting grounds were in this direction, and it is still called the ‘ Khiaban-i-SbahT ’ (the “ royal road ”), but since his death it has been neglected and fallen into ruin, the sections that have suffered most being the Hazar Cham and the stone paving {sangfarsh) in stage 6. Aharbashm remains open except during the severest weather; but Kandavan is usually closed by snow from December to April. In summer the forest in the last stage is infested with large horseflies (Persians usually take animals through at night to escape them), and mosquitoes breed in myriads in the lowland belt of rice cultivation between the foot-hills and the sea. Men and animals are tormented by these pests and a journey along this stage between June and September is a never-to-be forgotten experience. Supplies. Milages in the Jajarud, Shahristanak and Gachisar valleys, stages 1 and 2, are numerous but small. Shahrista nak comprises more than 1G0 houses, but few others amount to 50. In winter many of the inhabitants emigrate to the Caspian lowlands. I rom the watershed to the sea villages are few and far between, and beyond Valiabad, stage 3, they are almost deserted in summer, when the inhabitants take their flocks and herds to graze in the highlands and escape from the heat and the insect pests. In the villages in stages 1 to 4, sheep, eggs, mast, cheese* walnuts, hay and bhoosa are plentiful, but sheep may have to be fetched from grazing grounds in the mountains. Vegetables are scarce with the exception of marrows and cucumbers in summer; cherries mid-June to mid-July, apricots mid-July to August $ and plums in September are obtainable in some villages. Rice is obtainable everywhere and from stage 3 onwards is t e staple diet of the country. Wheat and barley can be obtain ed after the harvest, which is reaped in July, but the crops pro- uced in these mountain valleys are insufficient for the needs ox the villagers throughout the year, and they supplement them379 «%tlie ■li, whose it is still the stone ; weather, ember to sted with at night e lowland ea.

Tea, sugar and salt should he Carried. The average village can provide one day’s supplies for 25 men and 30 animals, though it would be advisable to send a messenger one day ahead to have bread baked. Before the harvest flour and barley are so scarce that is is advisable to take them from Tehran. In July 1920 a party of 50 gendarmes with 20 horses at Shahristanak experienced great difficulty in local requisitioning of flour and barley for their requirements for one Week in the Laura valley. For stages 5 and 6 supplies can conveniently be fetched from Kalardasht, see Lateral Route No. VI (b). Trrmsporh—Three or 4 convoys of 15 to 20 mules daily are Usually met on a day’s march. Many return empty from Teh ran to Mazandaran. Their loads average 170 to 200 lbs. Foreign animals can travel along this road, but they are not suited to the country, and do not know how to pick their way Over difficult ground like the Persians. The descent of Hazar Cham and the cobble pavement of stage 4 are a trial to them, and they cannot carry such heavy loads. Climate ;-—Stages 1—3 resemble the Persian plateau, but owing to their elevation they are colder in winter and more tem perate in summer. The midday shade temperature in the valleys early in August averages 70° to 80° according to the alti tude. After the descent of the Hftzar Cham in stage 4, the nights are still cool but the sun is hot by day. The average maximum summer shade temperature does not exceed 80°. The transition from Yailaq. summer quarters, to Qishldq, winter quarters, is most pronounced below the Pul-i-Zughal in stage 6, where the dense forest is hot and close in summer and insect pests begin. In stages 4 to 6 rain may fall at any season but is very variable; e.g., in 1919 there was no rain from mid-June to mid-August and the vegetation was drooping from drought, whereas in 1920 much rain fell throughout this season. Rain even in summer causes a damp cold. In Summer tents are unnecessary as there is shade at every stage and in case of rain a small party can obtain accommodation iii Villages.

At 3 miles past Tgil, and at 4| miles reach Ahar, surrounded by cornfields and trees ; chdrv&amp;ddrs (muleteers) usually make Ahar stage 1 from Tehran as the road is good. Mounted men can reach Shahristanak from Tehran in one day, but this is too long a march for pack animals, which might, however, be sent by Imamzadeh Daod. Alternative Stage 2. From Ahar the road continues for 2 miles upstream through cultivation ; then zigzags up a somewhat steep hill, crosses a small plateau, and thence by a gentle gradient reaches the Ahar- bashm Pass, 9,300', the watershed between the Jajarud and Karaj basins. Thirteen hundred feet above stands a ruined dome, called the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar. From Aharbashm the road winds down to Shahristanak, passing Gilin in the distance, where Nasir-ud-DIn Shah built a shooting-box, now (1920) in disrepair. Near it is a waterfall coming from the Tochal peak. Shahristanak, 7,400', is a large but poor village with more than 100 houses and a good deal of cultivation around on both sides of the stream, which is about 15' wide and 1' deep. Plenty of good camping ground on level fields. The summer climate is rather trying owing to extreme variation between the hot sunny days and cold nights with heavy dew Shahristanak is the biggest place in the Laura valley and has a gendarme post. The Governor of the district lives at Kand and rarely visits it. Alternative Stages 1 and 2 join here. 3 GACHISAR .. 17 m. An easy march along river valleys. Pack 51 m. animals 8 hours excluding halts. The road goes down the right side of the valley through a good deal of cultivation to Sarak (12 houses) at 5 miles. So far the road is good and fairly free from stones. Below Sarak the valley narrows' and is shut in by precipitous peaks. Cultivation ceases and the track follows the stony river bed to the junction Avith the main Laura valley from Gachisar at 6 | miles. This river is SAvift and deep and unfordable when flood ed with melting snow Avater from March to June, but by July it dwindles to a clear stream about 65' wide and 1' deep. The road improves and turns N. up the valley along the left bank; J mile above the junction is a pole bridge crossed by a track up the valley from Karaj bridge; see Alternative Stage 3, which here joins the main route. At 8-£ miles are teashop and lucerneRoute No. I (n)—contd r fields of Tang-i-Kasil surrounded by cliffs. Kasil village is a mile or two distant up a side-valley to the right. At 10 miles is the hamlet of Madanak, where the valley opens out a little, and hence to Gachisar there are considerable strips of cultiva tion. The principal villages are Hasan Ikdar (25 houses) on the right bank opposite to the road, where a track crosses a pole bridge to it, at 13J miles; Malikvalls (20 houses) also on the right bank and reached by a pole bridge at 14J miles ; fair camping grounds at each of these villages; and at Nisa (30 houses) on the left bank opposite Malikvalis about £ mile to the right of and above the road. At the back of this village on a plateau about 300' above the river is an ideal camping ground with good spring water, some shade and a splendid view of the valley. Nasir-ud-Dln Shah used to stay here when travelling to and from Kalardasht. The summer climate is very tempe rate, much more equable than at Shahristanak, and this is one of the best sites in the Elburz, S. of the watershed, for a summer camp and sanatorium. At 15J miles pass Khushkak (15 houses) perched on a plateau above the left bank of the river at the junction of a large tributary from Azadbar. No room for a camp here. At 16 miles the road crosses to the right bank by a pole bridge. The place is called Shahpul, after a brick bridge built by Nasir-ud-Din Shah, but destroyed by a flood a few years ago. Lateral Route No. VIII(5) branches off here via Azadbar to Talaghan, and Kazvin is 4 or 5 marches distant in this direction. The road skirts cultivation on the right bank to Gachisar (20 houses). Camping ground on field before village is reached. This is an easy stage with no consi derable gradients. The surface is fair but stony in parts, especially below Sarak. 4 VALlA BAD .. 16 m. Pack animals 7 • (7,200'.) hours excluding halts. 67 m. The river bends at right angles to the E., and the track turns up a barren side- valley. The ascent, trending W., is gradual, and going is good over gravel to a teashop at 3 miles at the foot of the Gardaneh- i-Kandavan. The road makes 13 zigzags up the mountain side, is steep at the turns but on the whole the gradient is fair, free from stones and not difficult for pack animals. The ascent from the teashop is 1,600' to the ridge at 6 miles and takes l| hours.Rotue No. I (n )— conld. The summit is flat. Elevation 10,200'. On the N. side there is a steep but not difficult descent of 1,000' to a teashop in a valley with good drinking water from a stream, which rises b mile above The track is good and gradually drops down th^ right side of the valley. At 9 miles it forks; the N.-E. (right hand) branch leads to Duna andNur, Lateral Route No VIII (s) The road follows the N.-W. branch down to the stream’ which it crosses, and rises over a shoulder of hill, where vegetation and small oak trees begin, and a splendid view suddenly expands over the immense gorge of the Ghalus bordered by impassable forest- clad ranges. The soil here changes from gravel to clav and must be heavy after rain. Steep descent of 2 miles to Allamhl at 12 miles a village of ten houses on the left bank of the Chalus where a tributary from the W. meets it. The track crosses over a stone bridge to the right bank at 14 miles. The river is small but has a very rocky bed. From the bridge is a steep rise over a bare hill to \'a!]abad. These last two miles are a wearisome climb over boulders. Indifferent camping ground in fields b mile short of the village of Valiabad situated £ mile above track Supplies are not easily procurable owing to the suspicious nature of the inhabitants, who require money in advance. Advisable to collect beforehand. In winter people migrate to the sea- coast. The inhospitality of this village was also remarked by the Political Officer, Kazvin, who travelled along this road in 1920 The surface generally is fair in this stage, but the ascents and descents make it a trying march. 5 TUVIR .. .. 18 to.

One mile from Valiabad the slopes become wooded and charcoal is prepared for Tehra^. The descent of Hazar Cham (road of 1,000 windings) commences here and continues for 7 miles. It is a 10-foot road constructed some 60 years ago by Gasteiger for Nasir-ud-Din Shah, and at 3 miles there is a tunnel cut through a ridge of rock with a marble tablet to his memory The road has not been kept up and the surface is loose stone and rock. It follows a sinuous course hundreds of feet above the right bank of the Chalus. The mountains rise abruptly384 Koute No. I (ft)— contd. to 10,000' and 11,000'and the cliff and forest scenery resembles Norway. From 5f miles to 8 miles the road is extremely steep and wind ing and when the stones are slippery after rain must be severe for pack animals. At 8 miles it reaches the teashop of Hazar Cham on river bank at 3,400'. This is closed in summer. At any season supplies, with the probable exception of fodder, would be very scarce here and there is no village of any size in the Chalus valley nearer than Tuvlr. Good water from a brook. At 8J miles cross to the left bank by a pole bridge, and at 9 miles pass small rice fields on the right bank, likewise deserted in summer. At 10 miles recross the Chalus by a pole bridge to the right bank. A stream from Talaghan flowing S.-W. to N.- E. meets the Chalus on the left bank just below the bridge. This junction is named Duzdabun, but there is no teashop or village. For routes to Talaghan up the valley see Communications (d) in the Epitome. The Talaghan stream is slightly larger than the Chalus and below Duzdabun the combined river has a con siderable volume of water and owing to its steep boulder-strewn course it is practically unfordable even in summer. At 13 miles recross by a pole bridge to the left bank and at 131 miles at the junction of a large valley from the W. are the teashop and two houses of Makaru. There is a good shady camping ground below bridge at 13 miles on the right bank opposite Makaru, but supplies have to be fetched from Tuvir, 4|- miles distant. If a halt is made here the journey from Valiabad to the Caspian is divided into 3 equal stages. At 18 miles is Tuvlr village, 800' above river and 400' above road. Teashop and camping ground are on the roadside. For the last 8 miles from the foot of the Hazar Cham the descent down the valley is very gradual.

Farahzad, at the foot of the hills, is 7 miles m. across the Shimran slopes via Aivin from Qulkhak and about the same distance from Tehran. Chdrvdddrs usually come here overnight and make an early start for Shahristanak next morning. From Farahzad the road goes N. up a barren narrow valley to Yungazar teashop at 12 miles, and a little beyond it climbs steeply tb a ridge 1,000 / above the valley at 14 miles. The ascent then becomes gentle and is followed by a longish descent to Imamzadeh Baud in a valley which drains down to Kand. Imamzadeh Baud is a shrine which attracts a number of pilgrims, but very scanty supplies and no accommodation are available. So far the road is excellent. 2 SHAHRISTANAK. .. 11 m. The road goes up the valley and then after 27 m. another steep climb of about 1,000' reaches a ridge to the left of it at 2 miles.

Alternative Stage 3. From TEHRAN to junction of the SHAHRIS- TANAK and GACH1SAR valleys in stage 3, via the KARAJ valley. Distance 30 miles. 2 stages. This route avoids crossing a ridgb to Laura (upper Karaj basin) and ascends the valley gradually to Kandavan, the only obstacle between Karaj and the Caspian, but it traverses defiles and rocky ledges, difficult even for Persian animals, and the surface is' very^ bad. In summer the valley is rather hot, and in winter during severe weather, when the passes are snow-bound, it is the only route open to Laura. Varian, a large village of about 100 houses, is half-way.

Path is narrow throughout and indifferent in parts, also rocky, but nowhere difficult. It leaves Baladeh by side streets and descends to the left bank of the Nur river at one-third of a mile; then makes a detour round some gardens over an abominable pavement of boulders to the foot of a cliff and then drops again to the river at a camping ground and meadow. Below the meadow it passes through a gorge along the stony bed of the river which it twice fords (the river was 20' deep with a firm gravel bottom) and then rises gently to the small village of Zardikamar (25 houses), 250' above the left bank at 2 miles. For use v/hen the river is in flood an alternative track through the gorge is built up the cliff side and climbs steeply to a narrow rock cleft some 70' above the river, only just wide enough to admit a loaded pack animal to pass. Below Zardikamar the valley widens to 4 mile. It is mostly shingle and rank grass, and is devoid of cultivation. The moun tains on both sides are extremely-bleak and savage. The track is on slope of hill at varying heights to 5 miles where it crosses a wooden bridge to the right bank at I)avilat (20 houses with gar dens). Half mile above Davilat on the right bank is a highly cultivated side-valley with villages whence supplies could be fetched.

The valley narrows to 200 yards and is very desolate. The river is swift and boulder-strewn. At 11 m. pass a small strip of cultivation on the right bank. Takor (left bank) stands 200' back from river and 100' above it. Contains 50 houses with gardens, which produce fine Victoria plums and greengages in autumn. It is the home of the Baha family. Nizam-ul-Mamalek, a cousin of Abdul Baha, is usually governor of Nur and keeps_open house to all travellers. The route to Amul follows the Nur valley through the village of Tataristaq at 12 m., where jungle commences, down to its junction with the Haraz (about 20 miles), which it is said to cross by a bridge at Siabushi (Main Route I, stage 5). From Takor a fair mule track goes N.-E. to the lowlands of Nur, N.-W. of Amul. It crosses the Lamand ridge, about 9,600', and descends by fairly easy gradients to Rudbarak (30 houses) at the head of a valley, draining down to the Caspian. The second stage lies down this valley, which soon becomes a forest-clad ravine past Vaz to Jurband where the stream leaves the hills, and jungle paths lead to’Abdulabad, Dar Kaleh (winter residences of Mu’azid-ul-Mamalek and Nizam-ul-Mamalek, the principal landowners of Nur) and other villages. The track is indifferent to bad. In 2 places it follows the river bed between high cliffs, and in spring is only passable in early morning before the snow v/ater comes down and makes the stream too big and deep. 2 NAMARISTAQ .. 13 m.

The hills on the left are bare and liable to sudden devastating storms, one of which had occurred in August 1919. Tiny watercourses ordinarily dry had become torrents, and the cultivated land had either been washed down into the river or covered with deposit of boulders and d6bris.

H. Arbuthnot, July 1905. Epitome. General .—Stages 1 to 5, a little travelled route, and one avoided by caravans owing to frequent robberies in stage 4. At stage 5, the most westerly of three alternative roads between Qum and Isfahan is struck; but, although its surface and gra dients are the best of the three, it is not used by caravans owing to its long stages and general insecurity. The road. —To stage 5 could be easily made suitable for wheeled artillery and transport; its remaining stages are quit* suitable in their present condition. Sykes travelled by motor to Tehran from Isfahan vi&amp; Hashti j$n in May 1917 and found the going good. C70aSB ‘ 2 p482 Route No. V(e.)— contd. Supplies .—The quantity available varies considerably. At stages 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 sufficient for a battalion with transport forone day. Stages 2, 5, 6 for 50 men and 200 animals for one day. The last three stages being the Isfahan plain, abundant supplies of wheat, barley, tobacco and fruit in season, besides live stock, could be collected for considerable,body of troops and for a considerable period. Water.—-1$, abundant for all practical purposes, and good at stages 1, 3, 4&gt; 5, and 10. It is good though limited at stage 2, while at stages 6 and 7 the running water is brackish and polluted., though a few wells provide fairly drinkable water. Transport.—A certain number of mules, probably 200, would be available at Sultana bad. During the intermediate stages there is little or none beyond animals in use for agricultural purposes, until stage 8 is reached. From here onwards to Isfahan a large supply of mules would be found immediately available to probable number of 2,000, besides perhaps 200 camels. In a month or more large numbers of mules and further camels to a limit of perhaps 5,000 and 500, respectively, could be collected from the villages in the Isfahan plateau and the Chehar Mahal. Physical obstacles .—None to'speak of. The direct road from Sultanabad to Isfahan is via Khumal and Deh Hak, 1671 miles in 8 stages {see Minor Route No. 4). No. of stage ' and total distance.

At 5 miles a track branches S.-E. to Hasanabad and Bagdadari. At 64 miles some vineyards are passed. At 9 miles the track leaves the Isfahan road {via Gili), and continues nearly due E. to the village of Amunabad at 14 miles. Thence slightly N. of E. the road passes through low hills, and at 18 miles enters the plain with a slope down from a rocky range which flaiiks it to the N.-E., and under the brow of which is situated the extensive village of Andijan, a prosperous locality of some 2,500Koute No. V(e). — conid. inhabitants, with considerable carpet industry-—some 2,000 or 3,000 are produced yearly. Supplies fair; water ’ in abundance. 2 CHINAR ,. .. 10 m. General direction S.- ' (6,020). E. The road is 31 _ a gradual ascent to the end of the plain, 3 miles, with a steepish ascent to the top of the pass, 6,900 feet at 4 miles. The descent is less pronounced. The road now passes through a stony desolate country always descending in switchbacks, till the village of Chinar is reached. A small village of about 600 inhabitants; supplies limited; water good. 3 BUTTON .. *• 14 m. General direction E. *■' (5,600'). The track crosses , the plain to the foot of the lulls, which it enters at 1| miles, then winds through them with a gradual ascent to 4 miles, when it enters a gorge. A track leaves it at 5 miles going N., which should be carefully avoided. The track, now pointing N.-E., climbs one or two small ascents, and finally crosses a gardan about 6,800 feet at 8 miles, from which the village of Buzjun is visible due E. across an intervening sea of hills, over which the road passes with but slight changes in elevation, though always descending, and after a first descent of some 400 feet. Buzjun is a prosperous village of some 1,200 inhabitants. Caravans and travellers are cons* tantly being looted between this village and Mahallat. and, though these misdeeds are attributed to bands of Lurs from the Bakh- tiari, country, it seems much more likely that the robbers are drawn from the immediate neighbourhood. Supplies and water abundant. 4 4 MAHALLAT .. 16 m. After crossing the (5,830'). narrow valley j n 61 m. which Buzjun is situated, the track ascends the hills sharply due E., mostly through a water-course, until the top of the ridge is reached at 3 miles Thence it continues a switchback ascent to 5 miles, elevation about 6,500 feet, whence it descends and enters at’ 6 miles a deep gorge (the Tang-i-Safid), some 500 feet wide. Direction 2f2484 Route No. V(e).— contd. now S.-E. At 10 miles it passes out of the gorge and, pointing E., follows the contour of the hills which are left at 13 miles, and descends into the plain in which the several villages known as Mahallat are situated. The first of these is Deh-i-Bala at 15 miles. Passing through it and its many gardens, the Kaleh and birthplace of the Agha Khan family is reached at 2 miles beyond, while still 1 mile farther is Deh-i-Pam. The total number of inhabitants is estimated at some 20,000. A range of high moun tains, 10,000 feet to 12,000 feet, bound the plain closely to the N., and at a distance of some 5 miles to the E., and S.-E. with outlets N.-E. towards Qum, and E. to the Naizar road towards Isfahan. The district is well-cultivated, with extensive gardens and water from several sources in abundance. The water of the Ab-i-Mark is the best drinking water. 5 HASHTIJAN .. 24 m. General direction E.- (6,010') S.-E. Leaving the 85 m. Deh-i-Pain from the N.-E., the track has a gentle slope downwards through rough and mostly uncultivated ground to the river Ab-i-Nimavar, which is crossed at 5 miles by a stone bridge without parapets, and a little farther on again by a temporary bridge; then N.-E. past the village of Kimavar, the property of the Zil-es-Sultan, at 7 miles. Thence a slight and gradual descent in an easterly direction through uncultivated stony ground, though the track itself is good, skirting the mountains of which the highest point is the Kuh-i-Usur (about 12,000 feet). On turning this, the track is S.-E. through wild, rolling country until the village of Hashtijan is reached at 24 miles, hidden away in the hills. A small village of 400 inhabitants. Supplies ample, water plentiful, the best for drinking purposes being that from the qanat at about 300 yards to the N.-E. of the village.

A long, 131 m. steady, gradual pull uphill for the first 12 miles to top of the first ridge, thence still ascending over more broken ground to 16 miles, elevation about 6,600 feet. The road then, after several ascents and descents, winds through a valley with a marshy swamp and ascending leaves it at 24 miles. Then a gradual descent into abroad, un cultivated plain, the road trending S. by S.-W,, and reaching the outlying gardens of Mehmeh at 36 miles and the village at 38- miles, 2,500 inhabitants. Water and supplies good. 8 MuRCHEKHuR •. 34 m. General direction S.- (5,500'). E. The road passes 165 m. along, a succession of some 8 villages to the right; the direction for the first 10 miles is almost due S. with a gradual ascent. The top of the ridge, about 6,700 feet, is reached at 12 miles, then trending S.-E. a long-drawn col is traversed, culminating in the ascent of another ridge, 6,200 feet, at 22 miles. The descent (direction S.-E. by E.) is at first abrupt, but soon becomes very gradual, and is con tinuous until the outskirts of the townships of Murchekhr (400 inhabitants) is reached.

From this point the track enters the hills and becomes extremely stony. After crossing a deep, dry ndld, which runs N.*E. reach the fair sized village of Karim Dasht. Supplies and water good ; also a small sarai. Road passable for all arms. Carriages are sometimes sent by this route to Isfahan, although the route is very rough. There is a rise of 550 feet from Kashan, where the climate is detestable. 2 ANDIJAN (HINJAN) 20|- m. The road at first (^SoO'h consists of a series of 32| m. rises and falls across low, rolling hills. At 1J miles and at 2J miles pass tracks Tun ing W. to Nasrabad and Tutmareh, both stated to be some 6 miles nearer the great range. At 4-|- miles the village of Shah- dehan, 2 miles E. and lying in more open country ; thence a steady rise to Robat-i-Sang at 11| miles, just short of which Shujabad lies to the E. miles from the road. Kasban terri tory is quitted, the boundary being at 5J miles. Robat-i-Sang possesses a tumble-down sarai and a hauz of good water. A few supplies can also be got, as this is the usual stage when the journey from Natanz to Kashan is accomplished in two days. Leaving the sarai, the track makes for the snow-clad range of Kuh-i-Kargiz. At 11 miles Jireh and Chilguia, some 2J miles to the E. and Vash, 16 miles to the W.

After a long but easy ascent, the watershed (5,855 feet) i's reached at 9|- miles, with a sweet spring just below its- northern slope. From this summit there is a beautiful view across the fertile valleys of Natanz, orchards commencing immediately below the crest. Passing down a river-bed, shaded by trees on both sides, at 12 miles pass through the ba~ar of Xatanz, which is of similar size to that of Zarand and Bafq.

The small Turk! speaking tribe of Rashvand, totalling about 150 families at Badasht, Duzdaksar, Mahmudabad, Shutur Khan, Madan, Haranak, Safidar, and Avaj in Alamut, stage 3, is the only tribe along this route. Persian is spoken as far as Salambar pass, and is understood by this tribe. From Salambar to the coast a Mazandarani dialect prevails but Persian is gen erally understood. The Tunakabunis are timid, sallow, unhealthy looking people in striking contrast to the robust hill men. In November 1919 the attitude of the inhabitants was every where friendly. In the event of any military operations it would be neutral. A desire to be left in peace and escape being looted, to conceal their transport and only to part with their scanty supplies at high prices (except perhaps in July imme diately after the harvest) and to stand well with the winning side, would be their prevailing sentiment. 12. Climate. —Every variety of climate is encountered, es pecially between the elevated ridge of Salambar and the steam ing vapour bath of the Caspian coast. The climatic divisions are I. Kazvin. Spring (21st March to 15th June)\s pleasant and healthy with cold nights and fresh sunny days. Heavy rain falls at intervals of 7 or 14 days. The change from spring to summer occurs very quickly between 20th May and mid June. Summer (15th June to 30th August) is somewhat unhealthy. It is very dry and dusty with a powerful sun. The difference between sun and shade temperature sometimes exceeds 30°. The shade temperature for a few days in July reaches a maxi mum of about 105. An obstinate type of malaria occurs, but is not very prevalent. Autumn (1st September to 15th November) resembles spring and is bracing, but the difference between day and night tem- parature is greater. Winter (15th November to 20th March) is cold and healthy. Rain showers commence in November and snow falls at inter vals of 10 or 14 days in December, January and February, and in some years lies on the ground for 4 or 5 weeks usually in Janu ary. The sun thaws it by day and it becomes soft and slushy. Spells of hard frost occur and the thermometer may drop to zero. The total rainfall averages about 10 inches.Route No. VI (b): — -contd. 2. Shdhrud and Alamut valleys .'—-As far as Badasht these are qishldq (lowlands) ; the climate resembles that of Kazvln but is much warmer. Spring commences 3 weeks earlier and autumn 3 weeks later. In summer the heat is excessive and no rain falls to relieve it. Rice is cultivated in Alamut, not to a great extent but suffi cient to breed mosquitoes and the valley is unhealthy in summer below Khushkidasht. October to April, inclusive, are healthy and pleasant. Lightfallsof snow occur as far down as Badasht, but do not lie. The rainfall, principally in spring, is a little heavier than in Kazvin. 3. KhushIHdasht to Gdvbdr .—This section comprises different degrees of yaildq or highland summer quarters, varying accord ing to the elevation above sea level, and culminating at the Salambar ridge which is arctic from December to end of March. Below Maran a change of climate commences ; below Saribalan this is accentuated and the transition is made from the dry cli mate of the Persian plateau to the humid relaxing climate of the Caspian coast. The summer climate of the upper forest levels, i.e., to near Gavbar, is delightful. The breeze from the Caspian keeps the atmosphere slightly damp and the sun is much less powerful than on the plateau. 4. Gdvbdr to the Caspian coast—This section comprises vary ing degrees of qishldj culminating in the notoriously insalu brious and malarial Tunakabun plain. In summer the presence of horse flies in the forest are the first and most unpleasant symptom of the transition. In the winter snow does not usually fall below the Do.Hazar junction. Rain falls at all seasons, but chiefly in autumn, winter and spring. The annual fall probably averages 40 inches, being a little less than that of Gllan and more than that of Mazandaran. The climate of the Tunakabun plain is very capricious and not divided into clearly defined natural seasons. A spell of sunny weather makes the winter hot, and rain even in mid summer brings cold. The humidity from May to September, when the ricefields are flooded, is excessive and permeates every thing.524 Eoute No. VI (b) — contd. Subject to this reservation the seasons are roughly :— Spring. 20th February to 14th May.—Heavy rains at intervals of a few days followed by periods of bright sun. Mosquitoes have not appeared, and the climate is pleasant and healthy until mid April, when, although still cool, it becomes relaxing. Summer. 15th May to 15th September .—An excessively steamy and relaxing heat, except after rain when the damp cold which ensues is equally trying. Autumn. 15th September to 30th November .—Humidity and mosquitoes diminish and cease and the climate becomes cooler and very pleasant. Winter. 1st December to 19th February .—Is mild and wet, resembling the south of England. Frost is unusual, but heavy falls of snow are not unknown. The Tunakabun climate may be summed up as pleasant and healthy though slightly relaxing from 1st October to 30th April, poisonously unhealthy, malarial, and enervating from 15th May to 30th August, the intermediate months being transitional between these 2 periods. The only seasons therefore when the climate is comparatively equable through the whole route are 20th March to end of April, and in October and November. c The changes of climate from qishldq to yaildq and vice versa bring out fever in many Indians and Persians. 13. Rain and Floods. —Rain, with the exception of very occasional storms in spring and early summer, would never interfere with the movement of troops or transport. In the forest it is unpleasant but not a hindrance. Flood water from melting snows renders the Shahrud and Alamut rivers unford- able from 1st March to 30th June, when Alternative Routes 1 and 2 must be selected. The Seh Hazar is bridged and its floods are no obstacles. The water from these rivers never reaches the road. The Tunakabun plain is covered with the dry stubble of the ricefields from October to April, and, unless flooded intention ally, can be traversed throughout by men and animals. From May to September the flelds are under irrigation and the whole becomes an impassable swamp, and can only be traversed b}' the causeways leading from village to village.Koute No. VI (b) — contd. 14. Tactical. —The Alamut gorge above Garmarud, stage 4, affords impregnable defensive positions against any force ad vancing from the sea. The cliffs are unscaleable except by the road, and the positions could only be turned by detours, see paragraph 15, sections 5 and 6, which are closed by snow from December to May, and could be held by small parties in summer. The narrow winding Seh Hazar defiles from Saribalan to Gavbar, stage 6, afford strong natural defensive positions against any force from the N. In the guerilla warfare practised by small bands of Persians requiring no communications or trans port, these could be turned by detours up the steep forest-clad mountain sides ; but such undertaking would be most hazardous, if not impossible, for an organised force. For alternative routes via Kalardasht to avoid these, see paragraph 15, section 6. 15. Alternative Routes. For whole route .— 1. Westerly. The next mule route to the W. from Kazvin to the Caspian coast is via Anbu bridge, Gavanehkul bridge, Laspu and down the Pul-i-Rud valley to the coast where it joins Minor Route No. 2 about 5 miles E. of Rudlsar and 33 miles W. of Khurramabad. Total distance from Kazvin to Khurramabad approximately 125 miles. The road over Gavanehkul and down the Pul-i- Rud valley is said to be very bad. 2. Easterly.—From Kazvin along the Tehran road to Hissar, 12 mileg, via the Angar pass to the Talaghan valley at Kalarud, 35 miles, up this valley to Joistan, 65 miles (?), or direct to Joistan from Qishlaq on the Tehran road. From Joistan {a) up the northern branch of the river by Parechan and via Hasarchal pass (closed by snow from November to June) to Kalardasht, 105 miles (?), and Khurramabad, 140 miles. . This is a circuitous detour by bad mountain mule tracks.

Darkuh is one stage from Arud, and Darkuh to Kalardasht or to Nishta is a second stage. The high ridges crossed by these 3 routes are all closed by snow from December to May. 7. From Kaldrdasht to Khurramdbdd.—See “ Routes from Kalardasht to the Caspian coast ” [wide Lateral Route No. 2 (3)]. From Abrang, between the Sardabrud and Chalus rivers to Khurramabad is stages along or near the coast. The first stage may be made to Kalarabad (25 houses), 1J miles inland and off the road, or ’Abbasabad (30 houses) or Passandeh (Nishta Rod) (40 houses), both on the coast. In the first 5 stages any of the village^ near the road can be selected for a halt. 16. Alternative.—This route can be divided into 6 stages instead of 7 stages if the first halt is made at Simiyar. Kazvin to Simiyar, 21f miles, is not difficult for mounted men, but it is a long stage for infantry. Khushkidasht, 48 miles from Kazvin, 21 miles from Karin- deh Chal, stage 2, has good supplies and camping ground, and might be selected instead of Shahrak, 39 miles, stage 3. , The only advantage of halting here instead of Shahrak would be to shorten the 4th stage to Garmarud to 8 miles before the arduous 5th stage over Salambar. Stage 6 can be made either at Maghzilat or Gavbar. The Tunakabun plain is all cultivated and any village can be selected for a halt. The grass square in Khurramabad and the turf along the coast are the best camping grounds. Notes —a. Tentage is unnecessary for a party of not more than 30 men on the march as accommodation can be obtained.528 Route No. VI (b) — contd.

Return J mile towards Rashtagan, then cross the stream and go E. through vineyards. The track then rises over open undulat ing country and drops to the next valley at 2 miles where it is joined by a path up the valley from Ashnistan, The surface so far is excellent. Follow up the stream to 3 miles and then go N.-E. up an easy gradient along a good track to the top of the ridge (7,500' ?) at 6 miles. To the S. lies the Kazvin plain, and to the N. the Shahrud valley (the bottom of which is out of sight), with the main mountain barrier rising on the far side. An open view is obtained over Alamut to the east, but the Talaghan river breaks through a gorge from the S.E. and its course cannot be distinguished. Salambar is N. W. of the head of the Alamut valley and the lofty jagged peaks N.-E. are the Takht-i-Sulaiman. These are on the far side of the Darijan valley (see below) and the highest in this part of the range, elevation 14,500' ?. Their summits are visible from Kazvin in an N.-E. direction. The track makes an easy descent to N.-E. working round the top of the basin530 Route No. VI (b).- — contd. Alternative Route 1. The spring floods fill the water course and close this passage. At 6| miles opposite to some sheep pens named Ghurda , the valley expands, and the path which has hitherto been stony, con tinues to improve to Badasht (60 houses) at 10 miles. Badasht is on the right bank and the path crosses a pole bridge to it. It is a well to do village with rice, wheat and barley cultivation, at the junction of the stream from Muallim Kalaleh (4 miles N. vide Alternative Route 1) with the Alamut river. It is just within the district of Rudbar, which extends from here for 30 miles down the Alamut and Shahrud rivers and comprises some 100 villages which are much more prosperous than the 66 villages of Alamut upstream from Badasht. Rudbar and Alamut are both under the Kazvin Governorship. The track now keeps to the right bank and is good except in places where the hillside comes close to the river. It passes Bagh Kalaleh (15 houses) at 9J miles, and lower and upper Shuristan, two poor villages of 10 houses each, all on the left bank, to Shahrak (15 houses, but prosperous) at the entrance to the side valley of Andaj. 5 miles N. up this valley is the large village of Kuchanan (100 houses) from which supplies could be collected. A ule track starts up this valley, turns E. through Khush- kichal and passes over to Do Hazar (vide paragraph 15, section 4 above and stage 7 below). The Badasht-Shahrak section of the valley has considerable cultivation, chiefly rice, and additional supplies can conveniently be fetched from Muallim Kalaieh. From Shahrak upwards, more especially above Khushkidasht (see below), the villages are very poor as mentioned in remarks on supplies. This main route through the Alamut valley is good and suit able for horses as well as ponies and mules. A pony will trot over most of it above Badasht and a sowar can ride from the junction of the Alamut and Talaghan rivers to Garmarud in 6 hours. From it tracks branch up to the larger villages which are situated, not by the river where there is little arable land, but up the side valleys and on small plateaux in the hills. Lateral communications between these villages, along the hillside and parallel to the valley road, are very bad.

They state from its highest point are seen the Caspian, Damavand and Alvand (behind Hamadan), and they reckon Elburz to be second in height only to Damavand. From Salambar however the Takht-i-Sulaiman appears considerably the loftiest. From Garmarad to the Caspian the road has been remade by Sipah Salar and his sons to give access to their estates in Tunakabun. Tolls are taken and it is kept in good repair. 5 MARAN • • 15 m. Pack animals 6J hours. General direc- 71 tion N.-E. The track enters a gorge behind Garmarud and is built on the cliff- side above the stream, but, except during flood, it is easier to follow the watercourse. At | mile it commences to climb out of the gorge by a series of sharp zigzags and to miles it is extremely steep, but 6 feet wide and in good repair. The village of Avanak can be seen below. From 2J to 5 miles it is a fairly stiff climb along a bouldery mountain side with views of grim precipices at the head of Alamut. In this section well sited sangars could command long stretches of the track below, and would be very difficult to turn owing to the precipi tous ground. Stone shoots could also probably be arranged and in one place the track is cut into a cliff and could be blasted down in 2 or 3 hours. Artillery could give no help. These positions can be turned in summer by alternative routes, vide paragraph 15, section 4 from Shahrak to Do Hazar and paragraph 15, section 5 for alternative routes from Alamut to Salambar. For alternative routes from Alamut via Kalardasht to Tunakabun see paragraph 1, section 6 (a). At 5 miles cross a ravine with a very steep ascent, after which the path has passed above the edge of the gorge and rises gradually over open moorland. At 61.- miles is Pichabun (5 houses) with large sheep pens. There is very rich grazing ground here in summer. At miles a path joins from the S.

See paragraph 10, section (3). On the summit of the Salambar ridge at 9 miles is a caravan' sarai with accommodation for 40 men and 20 mules built by Amir Asad, son of Sipah Salar, to afford shelter during the winter storms. These are much dreaded and overwhelm travellers caught in them. The .Maran valley (N.-E.) lies below, but Maran itself is hidden. The Takht-i-Sulaiman (east) is very fine and rugged. The country is still devoid of vegetation and owing to a bend in the N. the forest lower down the valley is out of sight. From Salambar the ridge runs first S.-E. and then E. to a mountain named Kargis, which commands a view over Tunakabun. 3 miles E.-S.-E. of this peak it bifurcates, one branch leading S.-W. up to Elburz and the other N.-E. up to Takht-i-Sulaiman, whence the main ridge goes E., but one branch, about 13,000 feet high, runs due N. for 4 miles forming the eastern end of the horseshoe round the valleys which unite under Mian Rud. The height of these ridges nowhere drops below 10,000 feet they rise precipitously from the valleys but the summit is usually rounded and not acute. From the caravansarai descend by easy gradients to Salam' bar village (8 hovels with very meagre supplies) at 12 miles. The road now enters a narrow valley between low but steep hills, which it follows to Maran (60 houses) about 100 feet above the left bank of the stream with cultivation around it, but no trees. From Maran an easy track crosses a spur of hills in an easterly direction to Sirn (15 houses), Shahristan (20 houses) and Darljan (50 houses) at 3 miles in the Mian Rud valley. Maran and these villages own about 100 mules. Mian Rud (8,000 ?) is a summer residence of Sipah Salar, I mile above Dari jam under Takht-i-Sulaiman. From here two tracks lead to Hasan Kif in Kalardasht. See paragraph 15, section 6 (6). A fair track goes S. to Joistan in upper Talaghan and thence to Gachisar, upper Karaj valley. See paragraph 15, section 2 .534 Route No. YI(6).- — contd. 6 GlVBlR .. 18 in. General direction N. 89 m. Below Maran the track makes a short climb to circumvent a cliff of shale, and then a very steep zigzag descent to the stream at 2 miles, which it follows to the junction of the Maran and Mian Rud valleys at 3 miles. These together form the Seh Ilazar, a clear water torrent and easily fordable except in spring. The valley now bends from N.-E. to N. Some scrub grows on the hills but no trees as yet. The track is excellent and goes along the hillside above the left bank passing under Yuj (12 houses) at 4J miles. Below Yuj it crosses the river by a bridge and rises 250 feet to Qazi Mahalleh (20 houses) on a spur above a small tributary from the E. at 5 miles. These are poor villages and raise scanty crops on the steep hillsides. There is no level ground for a camp. The mountains on the west side of the valley from here on- wrrds are clad with stunted jungle. The valley is dominated by the peaks of Garmadar and Shah Kuk to the N.-W., but is very open as far as Saribalan tea shop at 8 miles. The river has a rapid fall but the track keeps up on the hill A mile above on the crest to the right is Arad (30 houses) by which a difficult summer path leads via Darkuk to Kalardasht and to Nishta, see paragraph 15, section 6 (c). Northwards the range on the E. of Seh Hazar is impassable for animals, and Kalardasht is only accessible via Khurramabad from which it is 2| stages distant. The main route into Kalar dasht is from the E. via the PQl-i-Zughal in Chaliis valley. Below Saribalan the track goes down to the river and the natural features undergo a sudden transformation. Steep forest clad mountains hem in the valley, allowing no space for cultiva tion and in many places only a narrow passage for the river to wind between them. Ascents and descents are very numerous, but they are neither long nor very severe. The total drop from Saribalan to Gavbar is about 3,000'. The track is 5 to 6' wide, in places cut into cliff, but is good and remarkably free from stones. It crosses and recrosses 14 times by narrow cantilever wooden bridges. These were in goodRoute Nov VI (b).—eontcL condition, bnt in case of need could easily be reconstructed. The average width of the river is 25 / ; it is very rapid but fordable except when in flood. In the 8 miles below Saribalan there are several places where the road could be so far destroyed with explosives in a few hours as to req uire several days before it could be made passable for mules. Even without explosives much damage could be very quickly done, the path being walled up on its outer edge in many places. From Saribalan to Gavbar, but especially in these upper 8 miles, a few men fighting a rear guard action could cause great delay. There are numerous good positions for such a force, all of which could be turned but not without considerable- trouble. Below Gavbar the valley is straight without any posi tions, and the slopes on either side are not very steep, though covered with forest with thick undergrowth, which is not how ever generally an obstacle to progress. There are several tea-shops and huts of charcoal burners by the roadside but no supplies are procurable until Maghzilat is reached at 16 miles. It is on the left bank, and | mile above, on the hillside, is Khanlan (20 households in summer and 5 in winter).. Maghzilat and Gavbar contain 25 to 30 : wooden huts on open meadows, 1 mile long and \ mile broad on the river bank, which in summer afford good grazing, and people come up from Tunakabun with their cattle to escape from the heat and mosqui toes. In winter these settlements, are deserted: except for a couple of tea-shops. . At Gavbar is a bungalow built by Amir Asad as a- Halfway bouse between Khurramabad and Mian Rud. The wooden huts are roomy and accommodation could be found for 150 men. Barley and in winter all supplies must be fetched from- Khanian, or if a large quantity is required from Bo Hazar (see below). 7 SHAHSAVAR ... 21 to.. Pack animals 8 hours; General direction 110 w. N. Hills and valley arc thickly wooded but the-trees are-smaller and the undergrowth less dense than in Chalfls valley. The descent is very gradual, but the road is bad and 4 miles beyond Gavbar it becomes strewn with boulders and full of holes,536 Route No. VI (&amp;).— contd. Sections of stone-pavement sang far sh were in good repair, but progress over this pavement is always slow and tedious. The track crosses the river for the 5th time at 5J miles, beyond which it keeps to the left bank. At 6J is a wooden bridge over the Do Hazar river which flows from the S.-W. forming with the Seh Hazar an angle of 60° in which is Chaldarreh, a hamlet of 8 houses. The branch track from Shahrak via Sialan {vide above) comes down the Do Hazar valley, passing between 10 and 14 miles above the junc tion some 25 fertile villages which produce large crops of wheat and barley. This valley is usually filled with mist. The Do Hazar was 25' wide, swift but fordable and held slightly more water than the Seh Hazar. In flood season the Seh Hazar is the larger. Below the junction these rivers form a considerable torrent named Shir Kudkhaneh, 50' to 60' wide and difficult to ford in any season. Near Kashku its name changes to Mazar. Between 64 miles and lOJ miles are no villages but some teashops, the largest being Dirazulat at 7|- miles where tolls are taken. Beside each teashop a salmon weir and trap is built across the river. Below Dirazulat the track improves slightly, but boulders prevent a pony from trotting. At 104 miles cross to the right bank and at 11 miles turn E. along a stone pavement up a gentle rise out of the Mazar valley and down to a ford at 4| miles over the Valamrud, a tributary of the Mazar flowing down a shallow valley from the S.-E. This watercourse is wide and rocky but-normally holds little water. It is liable to big storm floods, which rise and fall very suddenly. At 124 miles it comes under the Ghalleh Gardan ridge on the right bank through which water is taken by a tunnel for irrigation. The road rises 150 feet to the summit. Below is spread out the highly cultivated plain of Tunakabun, about 7 miles in width and sloping gently from the hills to the sea, in every direction dotted with thatched villages surrounded by orange gardens and rice fields. Coppices and trees remain, but the forest which covers the hills, has been cleared from the plain. From Ghalleh Gardan is a steep zigzag down a stone pave ment passing the tea garden of Manzarieh on the left to Bala- deh (25 houses) at 13f miles.Route No. VI (6).— contd. From here to the coast the road is good and for the most part follows a causeway through rice cultivation. If the culverts over ditches were widened it would be passable for carts, but none are obtainable locally and they would soon cut up its unmetalled surface. At 161 mdes is Khurramabad (40 houses), the capital of Tunakabun and residence of local landowner's and merchants, who have fine houses around a large grass square, which is an excellent camping ground and could be used as an aerodrome. The largest of these residences belongs to Sipah Salar, the biggest landowner in the Province, and is situated in a park planted with cypress and all sorts of orange trees. The cultivators live in the adjacent villages and not in Khurramabad. The climate is abominable in summer and the inhabitants migrate if possible to the hills, otherwise to the coast at Shahsa- var which is healthier and for this reason has been selected by the Governor as his Headquarters. From Khurramabad a mule track branches off to the N.-jE. through Ab-i-Garm, 14 miles, reaching the coast at 24 miles, between Shahsavar and Rudisar. This route is 2 or 3 miles longer than the coast route but better going in dry weather as the surface is firm, whereas the soft sand of the shore is most tiring. The smaller streams _ are bridged but the main watercourses must be forded. It is a causeway through woods and rice fields and, owing to horseflies and mosquitoes, should be avoided in summer. It passes many villages. This road was constructed by Sipah Salar. The road reaches the coast at 19| miles and turns W. over sandy downs by the village of Mamsalnafcad (20 houses) to Chashmeh Gileh river, which it .crosses alopg a sandbar at the mouth and enters Shahsavar. 6 miles from the sea, the Mazar on leaving the hills divides into the two branches. The western branch £ mile beyond Shahsavar is the old channel and retains the name of Mazar, but has become a rivulet and the main stream is qow Chashmeh Gileh. The river bed is J mile wide, but holds little water as most of it has been diverted and absorbed in irriga tion, the fate of all rivers along this coast. It becomes unford- able for a day or two at a time during floods after storms in the hills.538 Route No. VI (6).— contd. Chashmeh Glleh is the most productive of the Caspian salmon rivers, and the fish are caught in great numbers in a trap 400 yards above the sea. Shahsavar contains a park, the property of Sipah Salar and now the Governor s residence, offices of Tumaniantz and of Customs. It is the port of Tunakabun for export of rice and oranges, and the coasting steamers plying between Baku Enzelf and Astarabad call here. The open beach which runs without a break along the sou thern shore of the Caspian from Enzeli to Ashurada affords no shelter, and the anchorage is J mile out to sea.

Cross this valley and pass Dikin (70 houses) on the hillside above it at 7 miles, and Muallim Kalaieh at 11 miles, and con tinue across undulating country in a S. Easterly direction and make a short descent to Shahrak. Dikin is the property of Sipah Sa'ar. Four fertile villages Astalbar, Muallim Kalaieh, Anadeh, and Shams Kalaieh are grouped in a shallow undulating valley and contain about 250 houses. They belong to Amir Asad who has a summer residence at Zavardasht and winter one at Muallim Ka 1 aieh. The country hereabouts slopes gradually down from the mountains to the ridge above the Shahrud and the soil is very rich and free from stones. The greater part of the cultivation is unirrigated but large crops are produced and supplies for 300 men and animals could be obtained for an indefinite period with out difficulty.

It has a fair surface of earth and gravel passable for Ford vans, but soft when wet. The ascent from a nullah before entering the gardens of Ashnistan and the lane through the gardens are narrow.' Beyond Ashnistan the country is undulating and the road deteriorates, but Fords can go as far as a deep nuliah at 13 miles. This is the limit for any wheeled traffic and the road becomes a pack animal track leading N.-E. up a narrow valley. At 15 tniles is a point where it could easily be destroyed by blasting. It crosses the stream and makes a short steep ascent to Vers (45 houses) at the foot of the hills dividing the Kazvln plain from the Shahrud valley. There is no good camping ground, the valley being too narrow and the level ground above it treeless and exposed but good accommodation can be found in the village. 2 CHALA .. 12 m.

From 2£ miles it is steep, but above it rises gradually along the open hdlside to the watershed at 5 miles. This is flat topped and the road drops gently to a caravansarai at 5| miles. Snow is drifted by the wind and blocks the last 2 J miles in winter. 2. The v inter track follows the main stream under Vers slightly N. of E. up a deep sheltered valley. At 4f miles it rises fairly steeply out of the valley to the summit at 6£ miles and meets (1) at 7 miles at the caravansarai, which can accom modate 30 men and 16 mules.

The surface is fair but the gradient is extremely severe and passable only for animals of the country. They march from Chala to Shireh Kuh in 2 hours. Shireh Kuh can be reached in one stage from Vers but no supplies a,re obtainable. At the end of spring it becomes infested with flies and after the middle of May a furnace. . ^ 0 .. From Kalarud (marked Kyamrud on Degree Sheet 8 L) to Shireh Kuh, a distance of 12 miles, the Talaghan river has flowed through a gorge. At Shireh Kuh this has widened to i mile and affords space for cultivation on the left bank. Mules can go to Talaghan by a path along the slopes above the left bank, but the direct and good route from Kazvm to Kalarud is via Hissar (12 miles along the Tehran road), Shakar- nab and Angar pass, total distance 35 miles. From KaJarud a good mule track leads through Talaghan over the Asalak ridge (10 000 ?) to Azadbar and Gachisar in the Laura (Le.^ upper Karaj) valley—see route report from Tehran to Caspian via Chalus valley. [See Lateral Route No. I (»).] From Shireh Kuh (1) during the low water season follow the valley down on the left bank and meet the track from Simiyaf just above the junction with the Alamut valley at 5| miles. _ _ (2) Opposite to Shireh Kuh on the right bank is the precipi tous knife edge ridge from Mount Elburz.

(c) Geographical.---Tl\e valley of the Zinjan Rud, 5,346 feet above sea level at Zinjan, running N.-W., is separated from the valley of the Kizil Uzun, running S.-E. to Manjil (1 030 feet a ! )OV ? bj t ! ie high range of mountains, Kuh Auguran, about 10,000 feet above sea level at its highest points At Zinj an the two rivers are only about 30 miles apart. The Zinjan Rud near Zinjan is a small stream fordable at any point, with a high range of mountains within 1 mile on its left bank and the Kuh Anguran range about 4 miles from its right ank. The Kuh Anguran range rises very steeply about 2,500 feet on the S.-W. slope and then drops almost as steeply t’ooO feet on the N.-E. slope, on which it is split into numerous ridges bv deep gorges (running N.-E.) in places as much as 3,000 feet deep whose sides are very nearly precipitous. The Khanchai and ChS streams run m two such gorges, and the route reported on runs along the ridge between these. Most of the range is stony and barren but there are a few villages at the foot of these gorges, with a little cultivation round them. On the top of the ridge is a plateau about half a mile broad, also cultivated in places, with a track on top, said to be used by the tribes immigrating to the hills in summer The range is crossed by many tracks, said to be much worse than that reported on, with the exception of that crossing the Ak Gaduk pass about 10 miles N.-W. of it—the main route used by trans port engaged in the carrying trade between Zinjan and Gllan— and said to be similar. All are very narrow and the gradients are such as to make them impassable for anythin* but nark transport. ° The Kizil Uzun valley from Vanisar to Manjil is at most four miles broad and narrows at Imamzadeh Qasim and again at 2j2548 TIoute No. VI (d) contd. Man] 1 to a deep gorge. It is bounded by ranges of high moun tains on either side. The river is very rapid, but is fordable at most places. It rises very rapidly immediately after ram and becomes temporarily unfordable, and is untordable between March and June, when the snow on the hills melts. The valley is very hot and unhealthy during the summer months. There are many villages and it is fertile within 10 miles of the junction of the Khanchai stream with the Kizil Uzun. but thence to Manjll there is little cultivation and there are few villages. , ] Halting places .—Halting places are suggested as under:— 1. Ziiijan town to Zakir . . 2. Zakir to Khanchat 3. Khaachm to Snrkha Diza 4. Surkha Diza to Gilivan 5. Gilivan to Iron Bridge, Manjll 16 miles. 71 miles. 18| miles. 11 miles. 17 miles. at n Stage (3) proved too arduous for Government 1st line transport mules. r fhe'-eareto be used it would be advisable to do this march in 2 days halting the Irst dav at Chaftan, 9 miles from Khanchai. In this case the second day a march be lengthened a little by camping at one of the_numerous vi lages close to me function of the Khanchai stream with the Kizil L’zun. Ahz, 3 as Km or las Km ni asherda With Persian pack transport however the stage Khfinchai-burkhil Dili I better as it saves a day and the camping ground at Chaftan is very steep. 2. Water .—There is little difficulty as regards drinking ivater en route. The main sources are as under :— Zinjan river . . Ample for a division. Zakir stream .. Ample for a brigade. Ivhanchai stream Ditto. Chaftan stream .. Ditto. Kizil Uzun River. Muddy but good and ample for any In addition there are springs sufficient for a battalion 4 miles from Zinjan and at Badamistan, and streams sufficient for a battalion at Badamistan, Kumshaku, Gilivan, Meramahad and Vachman, except at Gilivan where water would be sufficient for half a battalion only from June to October. No special watering gear is necessary for men or animals. 3. Supplies. —Barley, bhoosa and hay sufficient for the tarasport of a battalion can be obtained at all camping places .and other villages en route. Flour can be obtained sufficient for aRoute Ko. VI. ^Ooritd. battalion for 3 days at Surkha- Ca/.i, Aliz, Tashvin and Tash* vin-i-Dilagherca. Above can be obtained within one hour. Fresh meat sufficient for a brigade can be obtained at all villages within 4 hours. (Animals are sent to the hills to graze in the day-time and normally return at sun-set, except in the Kizil Uzun valley from June to October when all flocks are away in the stimmer highland pastures and 12 to 24 hours would be required to fetch them.) Vegetables and fruit are plentiful in the Zinjan valley, but otherwise scarce except in season. (In October onions and pome granates sufficient for a battalion can be obtained in most vil lages, where fruit growing is the principal industry, in the Kizil Uzun valley. There are no bazaars en rente. See Appendix A.) 4. Transport. -A considerable amount of mule transport works along the Ak Gaduk route from Zinjan to Guam There is very little other transport en route, and only very few boats on the Kizil Uzun river. (For approximate numbers and locality of animals, see Appendix A.) 5. Fuel. —Wood sufficient for a. battalion can be obtained at all villages e.n route. (See Appendix A.) 6. Grazing .—From April to July there is good grazing every where except in the Kizil Uzun valley which is very barren at ail seasons and only affords scanty grazing for sheep and camels. In other months very little and only along the banks of the rivers and streams. 7. Obstacles. —The range Kuh Anguran forms a difficult obstacle always but especially during the months February to June and July when torrents cross the tracks. These however are infrequent and caused by sudden rainstorms and cloud bursts in the hills and only make the track impassable for a few hours. Snow is said to improve the route [see paragraph 1 (fc)]. The KhanchaT stream can be forded at any time. The Kizil Uzun River cannot be forded between the months of March and June, but Persians are said to swim their animals across, and to get their loads across by ferry-—so it is presumed a force could do similarly. Boats are very scarce, bad, and small. There is one at each of the following villages-—Hindi Kandi, Gilivan and Meramabad. The Russians had a bridge (planks placed across chains) about 1 mile below Gilivan, where the river is about 40 yards across, and the banks at low water 3 feet high550 Koute No. YI (d) — contd. The “ take-off’ 5 boards still remain and a similar bridge or a flying bridge could easily be placed there. 8. Additional work necessary. —The route from Zinjan to Zakir could be made passable for all arms by one company of Sappers and Miners in two days, and for lorries in a further 3 days. From Zakir to Surkha Diza enormous labour would be required to make the track passable for A. T. carts. [See Appendix A (a) on Russian road to Surkha Diza from Zinjan, via Zarlan and KhSnchai.] From Surkha Diza to Manjil, in addition to the building of a bridge below Gilivan (see paragraph 7) little labour is required to make the Russian motor road passable for all arms. A company of Sappers and Miners could accomplish this in one week, and make it passable for motor lorries in a further week. 9. Camping grounds.—Good camping grounds sufficient for a battalion can be found at all halting places except Khanchai and Chaftan, where camps would be straggling as the ground slopes very steeply. None are liable to be flooded. 10. Communications. — {a) Neighbouring routes are:— (1) Main Tabriz-Zinjan-Kazvin road. (2) Track from Zinjan to Gilivan (where it joins route reported on) via Taham, Ak Gaduk pass, Aiye and Yanisar, where it fords the Kizil Uzun and runs down its left bank. (See paragraph 15.) (3) Russian motor road from Surkha Diza to Manjil. (See Appendix A.) (4) Russian road from Zinjan to Surkha Diza via Zarlan and Khanchai. 5. Track from Hindi Kandi to Manjil via right bank of Kizil Uzun, fording the Shahrud about k mile S. of Manjil Iron Bridge. (See paragraph 15.) (6) Track from Mianeh down the left bank of Kizil Uzun, joining route reported on at Gilivan. (This was reported on by Captain Fortescue and Lieutenant Lancaster, June 1920.) In addition tracks branch from the route as follows:— (1) From 3 miles short of Zakir, a track runs through the small village of Gianu, across the hills, and rejoins the , . route 1 mile beyond Zakir,Route No. VI (d)—contd. ’(2) From 1 mile short of Zakir a track continues W. through the village of Askami. . • . (3) From 1J miles beyond Zakir a track runs N.-E. across the Imam Gaduk Pass to the village of Imam. (4) From 1 mile beyond Khanchai, a track continues close above the bed of the Khanchai gorge, through Badamistan, 2 miles and on to Surkha Diza. This is passable for pack transport to 1 mile beyond Badam istan, but is said to be dangerous and impassable for pack transport beyond. (5) From 2 miles short of Chaftan a track continues down. the N.-W. slope of the ridge, through the small village of. : Zakar (one house) and circles upwards through the village of Baba-Muraz (3 houses) and rejoins the route about 1 mile beyond Chaftan. From this track another track runs to Vanisar (impassable to any form of transport). ' (6) From 300 yards short of Surkha Diza and again from the ford across the Khanchai stream opposite Tashvin, tracks run to Vanisar on the right bank of the Kizil Uzun, about 4 miles above the junction of Khancl^ai stream with the Kizil Uzun. (7) From J mile short of Kumshaku, a fair track runs S..-E. through the village of Chamlagh (20 houses) to the village of Tashir (50 houses) (landmark of “ Unclean Tower”), thence turns S.-E. along the foot of the hills. (8) From the river side portion of Gilivan, track runs through Gilivan into the hills. (9) From Vachman a track runs N. into the hills. (10) From Manjil Iron Bridge a track runs to the village of ’Aliabad and the main road runs N.-E. to Resht. (b) The route runs along the Tabriz-Tehran telegraph line as far as Dizeh, and does not rejoin a telegraph line till Manjil. The Russians probably had a telegraph line to Surkha Diza along their motor road as there are still a few telegraph poles and lengths of wire lying along the route. 11. Population—The route is very thinly populated except close to the confluence of the Khanchai stream with the Kizil Uzun, where the valley.is! fertile and there are villages every | mile552 Route No. VI (d) — contd. (For male adult population of villages en route, see Ap pendix A.) From Zinjan to Gilivan the people are Turkish speaking and are very friendly, especially since the advance of the Bolsheviks and the consequent approach of the Persian Cossacks, whom they fear and detest almost as much. The refugees fleeing from Resht to Zinjan have spread dreadful tales of the ravages of both. (In October the whole population of Gilivan had fled to the hills.) From Gilivan to Manjil villages are very few and are deserted except during the months of November to March. They are owned by Kurdish tribes, who depart to the hills as soon as the snows melt. 12. Climate. —(a) Zmjdn River Valleij : May-October.—Warm and pleasant, little rain. November-February.—Cold. Snow and frost. March-April.—Cool and rainy. (6) Kuh Angurdn Mountains : May-October.—Cool and pleasant. Little rain. November-February.—-Very cold. Deep snow. March-April.—Cold and rainy. (c) Kizil Uzun Valley: May-August.—Very hot. September-October.—Cool. Little rain. March-April.—Warm and rainy. 13. Snow, rain and floods .— (a) The snow melting in March and April, and heavy rains affect the route in its 3 stages as under:— (1) Zinjan River Valley—streams as much as 2 feet deep cross the roads and tracks but do not render them impassable. (2) Kuh Anguran Mountains—torrents race down the nullahs and cross the tracks; these however are of only a few hours’ duration and only render the track tempo rarily impassable. (3) Kizil Uzun Valley—(1) The river becomes unfordable from March to June. (2) The rise of the river puts part of the track under water, but never sufficiently to render it impassable. (3) Torrents race down from the mountains (see above). After rain at any time theRoute No. VI (d) — contd. Kizil Uzun rises rapidly but normally becomes fordable again within 12 hours. (5) Snow lies deep in the mountains and blocks up their valleys, but as this freezes hard it is said to make the route easier as the bed of the Khanchai gorge can then be used as a track. 14. Tactical. — (a) A line across the ridge between the Khanchai and Chal gorges at any point could easily be held against superior forces advancing in either direction, from Zinjan or Manjil. An especially good position would be along the stream which runs into the Khanchai stream just above Bada- mistan. (b) The Kizil Uzun Valley could similarly be held by a line stretching across the valley, on both banks. Especially favour able positions are at ’ Allabad Cham, Imamzadeh Qasim and Hind ZamTn. . 15. Alternative routes .—Alternative routes are :— (1) Main road Zinjan-Kazvln-Manjll. (2) Track from Zinjan to Gilivan via Ak Gaduk Pass. See paragraph 10 (2). This is said to be very similar to the track reported on. The ford at Vanisar is said to be more difficult than that at Hindi Kandi. (3) Track from 1 mile short of Zakir, via Askand, across the mountains and joining the main Kazvin-Manjil road at the Brick Bridge, Loshan. This is said to be a very difficult track. (4) Track from Hindi Kandi to Manjil along the right bank of the Kizil Uzun, fording the Shahrud half a mile S. of Manjil. This is said to be a dangerous track, im passable except to infantry without transport (Russians are said to have lost 6 men and horses who fell over the precipice). 16. Alternative stages.—{a) See paragraph 1 [d). (6) From Zinjan, if temporarily held up by a rise of the river, a halt could be made at Hindi Kandi or Geitu, and if necessary again at ’Allabad Cham, 5 miles short of Manjil Iron Bridge. At the former 2 places, supplies could be obtained as at Zakir—- ’Aliabad Cham is little more than a tea-shop, but barley, bhoosa and wood sufficient for a battalion with transport could be obtained.554 Route No. VI (d)—contd. Similarly from Manjil, if a long time were spent crossing the river, Tashvln would be a good place to halt and the 3rd day’s march would then be to Chaftan. No. of stage and total distance. Details. ZAKIR .14 m. 14 m. General direction E. The road to Dlzeh is the main road to Kaz- vln, unmetalled but of fairly good surface, and passable for all arms and motor lorries at all times. It passes a good spring (3 miles) and through the village of Sian (4 miles). From Dizeh the track branches off N.-E. towards the Kuh Anguran, runs W. just S. of the village of Glanu (through which a smaller track runs) and skirts the hills for two miles, when it forks ; the one branch continues W. round the hills through Askand, while the route runs N.-E. 'across the foot-hills to Zakir. To just short of Gianu the track is fair but crossed by four nullahs, which could be flooded to two feet deep. It is passable for all arms and could be made passable for lorries with little labour. From Gianu the track is narrow and difficult in places, rounding a spur, and could be similarly flooded in two places ; passable for pack transport only, but could be made passable for all arms and lorries with little labour. Gradients are not more than i except where the track crosses nullahs, when they may be i. Good camping ground for a battalion above the village on the stream. Supplies wood, meat, hay, flour and barley sufficient fora battalion. Good fruit and vegetables in season. 2 KHANCHAl .. 71 m. General direction N.- 9 9 ± E.

Supplies as at Zakir. 3 SURKHADlZA .. 13J m. General direction N.- E. The track is good 35 m. for 1 mile. Then track forks—the lower track, running close above the bed of the gorge to Surkha DTza, is fair to Badamistan, thence very steep and dangerous, and impassable to any form of transport. The upper track rises at about £ to the top of the ridge between the Khanchai and Chal gorges, and crossing the ridge at about 8,500 feet above sea-level, above the village of Badamis tan (3,000 feet below), it commences to drop rapidly at about running for 3-| miles on the N.-W. slope of the ridge—very narrow and boulder strewn. Here it forks again; one track continues round the N.-W. slope, and, forming a circle of about 4 miles, drops through the valley of Zakar, and, rising through the village of Baba-Muraz, rejoins the main track about 1J miles from where it left it. (From this track a path, impassable to any form of transport, branches down to Vanisar.) The main track crosses to the S.-E. slope of the ridge and runs through a deserted village and down the re-entrant in which runs the Chaftan stream to Chaftan. Surface fair, gradient f. (If Government mules are used it is advisable to camp above Chaftan.) Thence the track runs steep down 5,000 feet in 4 miles over a long spur, where the surface is very bad and is sometimes naked, jagged rock. The gradient is in places as much as 4. This portion of the track would be quite impassable for camels, if it were wet or slippery. At the foot of the spur the track forks; one part runs N. to Vanisar (5 miles), the other E. to the village of Surkha Dlza on the Khanchai stream, 4 miles from its junction with the Kizil Uzun. Good camping ground below the village. (Above the village the sides of the stream are very steep and it is difficult to reach the water.) Supplies as at Zakir—in addition sufficient flour for a battalion. - ■ ■ ' ’ &gt;’556 Route No. VI {d) — contd. 4 GILT VAN .. .. \\ m. General direction S.- 46 m,. E. The route follows the old Russian motor road throgh the village of Aliz (2| miles) and fords the Khanehai stream (always fordable) just opposite the village of Tashvin on its right bank and about 1 mile from its junction with the Kizil Uzim. Thence the route continues through Tashvin-i-Dila- gherda to | mile short of Kumshaku where the Russian motoivroad turns inland to avoid a difficult re-entrant, while the route continues along the bank of the Kizil Uzun, through the village of Kumshaku and Quarghulichan to the ford (2J feet deep on 29th October 1920) just below Hindi Kandi. “Here the river is said to be fordable at any time except immediately after rain and during the months of March to June, when a small boat is used as a ferry. There is a further recognized ford 5 miles f urther down stream (2|- feet on 2nd November 1920) below Geitu, where the Russian brid“ge used to be. At both the water is normally two to three feet deep. (N. B. —(1) The Hindi Kandi ford is said to be the best in the river for 40 miles above Manjll. (2) At the Geitu ford the river is only 40 yards across, the take-off boards of the old Russian bridge are still in position, and this would be an excellent spot to place a flying-bridge provided a very strong rope were used.) After fording the Kizil Uzun the route continues close to the left bank of the river to the river side portion of Gilivan. Throughout this stage the surface is fairly good and gradients are easy. There are good camping grounds sufficient for a battalion and water can be had either from the Kizil Uzun or the small Gihvan stream. Supplies as at Zakir. 5 MANJIL (Ikon Bridge) 17 m. General direction E. 63 steep spur about 1 mile from Gilivan. Thence on to Shah Maidan a piece of flat ground T| miles in length and 1 mile in depth {i.e., from the river to the hills). Here the Russian mouor road used to cross from the right bank, but there is now no bridge. The track however runs closer to the river than the motor road and crosses a second spur, thence across a smaller mmdav to the village of Meramabad (Kurdish and deserted 63 m. The track runs close to the river, crossing oneKoute No. YT (d) — contd. except from November to March). Here the river turns sharp S. for 2 miles and then 3 miles N.-E. The hills on both sides close right down to the river, which here runs through a narrow gorge. The Russian motor road keeps close to the river, passing the ruins Imamzadeh Qasim, but the track cuts straight across the curve, rising first J, thence through the Kurdish village of Vaehman and the stream beyond it, and drops down again to rejoin the motor road opposite the village of Qasimabad (on the right bank). Thence the track keeps close to the river and coincides with the Russian motor road, except when the latter circles round re-entrants. For the last 3 miles to the Iron Bridge, Marijll, the road is cut out of the side of the hills, which slope very steeply down the river. Throughout the march the surface is very good, but gradients very steep where the track crosses re entrants or nullahs. These render it impassable to anything but pack transport. Torrents in the nullahs would render the track difficult but not impassable. APPENDIX A. Russian Roads. ( a ) Zinjdn to Surkha Dnzd via Zarldn and Khdnchdl. In 1917 the Russians had under construction a road as above.. The road is passable for A. T. carts and Fords from Zinjan to Zarlan at the foot of the Kuh Anguran range, 7 miles N.-E. of Zinjan. Thence it is little more than a track, 3 feet broad and at present boulder strewn. It is impassable even to pack transport at many places, where it is crossed by stream or torrent beds, as blasting operations had not been completed. The line however is well chosen, gradients are very easy, about T V, but so as to secure this it zigzags and doubles very frequently—it must be twice the length of the track in use. It is probable that the Russians intended to make this a motor road. The line is roughly :— Zinjan, N.-E. across the plain to Zarlan; E. across the mountains, down a re-entrant and on to the track reported on 2 miles short of KhanchaT, thence it coincides with the track to 1 mile beyond Khanchai, where it continues along the KhanchaT gorge to within £ mile of Badamistan. where it circles N,-W. round a spur and558 Route No. VI {d)—conG 1 d. rejoins the main track, with which it coincides to the top of the ridge. Thence it keeps at a higher level, and running E., where the main track runs to Chaftan, it doubles andjzigzags down the Khanchal gorge and round a spur to Surkha Dlza. (6) Su kha Dizd to Manjil. Till 1917 the Russians used this as a motor road, crossing the Kizil Uzun by a bridge (planks placed on chains) £ mile below Geitu. This road is considerably longer than the track in use, as it circles round all spurs and up and. down re-entrants in order to ensure easy gradients (about ^ )- It is in good order with the exception that it is covered with stones in many places, and has been ploughed over at Aliz, Geitu, and Vachman. It has been carried away in about 15 places by torrents coming down the nullah beds. The line is roughly the same as that of the track in use, with which it very nearly coincides from Surkha Dazi to i a mile short of Kumshaku and from ’ AHabad Cham to Manjil. This road could be made passable for all arms, by rebuilding the bridge and one week’s work by a S. and M. Company, and for lorries bv a further week’s work. ROUTE NO. VI (e). From RESET to ZINJAN. Distance 108 mites. 6 stages. Authority. —Lieutenant-Colonel Smyth, D.S.O., from in formation supplied by Ardebil Otryad of Cossack Division who returned by this route in October 1920. General direction. —W. is dfZm 7% T TlliS / 0Ute iS 0nly 8uitab]e for P ack animals. It is difficult m places for even pack animals, on account of the steepness and roughness of the going. The numerous riversand streams also make it difficult, as many of them are un- fordable in winter. In summer it would be easier, and mountain guns could be taken, also perhaps the light field guns usually called mountain guns in these parts. No. 1 stage, Resht to Fumen, is passable for carts in moderate- lv good weather. The road is metalled and good enough for carts up to Zaidak at 44 miles, except for several rivers which would be impassable after rain, and in winter generally. The road passes through the jungle. The country is damp and unhealthy, with large amount of undergrowth. Supplies —Are scanty, and only enough for small parties. Water is abundant and of fairly good quality. Transport.—A. certain number of pack animals available. Boats available for crossing most of the rivers. FmcL—A bundant. Camping grounds .—Except at Darram, stage 4, where a brigade coidd camp, poor, in and round about the villages, and only suitable for small parties; jungle and rough ground combine to make it difficult to find extensive camping grounds. This does not matter much, as no large force is ever likely to march by this route. Climate. In the forest country extending as far as the watershed above Masuleh, stage 4, the rainfall exceeds 50 inches in year, and rain may occur at any season. In summer the lowlands of this region are hot, steamy and malarial. In winter the road is very difficult on account of swollen rivers, deep mud, etc. Beyond the watershed the climate is dry and presents the ordinary features of the Persian plateau. The'distriet of Tarum, i.e. Kizil Tzun valley, is lowdying and intensely hot from June to September. It is difficult in places even for them on account of the steep ness and roughness of the going. It is, however, much used by local mules and donkeys as the principal trade route between Gilan and Zinjan. The numerous rivers and streams also make it difficult in winter and spring, but, with the exceptions of the Passikhan and Juma Bazar roads, stage 1, and the Kizil Uzunin stage 5, floods which render them unfordable are only of a few hours’ duration. Transport .—A considerable number of mules and donkeys are engaged on the carrying trade in transit along this route. Boats available for crossing most of the rivers. There is a ferryRoute No. VI (e)—could. 2 MAKLAVAN ... 16 m. General direction W. ■ft Good metalled road as m ' before on leaving Rumen. Streams bridged, but at 1 | miles stream with broken bridge, which would make road difficult (or impossible according to amount of water) for carts until bridge mended. * At 4 miles Lulemon village, 400 houses, supplies as before On leaving Lulemon, Lulemon river has to be crossed :100 yards wide, 1 J feet to 6 feet deep according to amount of water in stream. Passable by all arms anywhere in summer or dry wea ther. Even in winter or flood time there are fords known to tl e local people by which horsemen and perhaps carts with difficulty could pass. Road good as before. Many small streams all bridged, passable by all arms. At 8 miles Zaideh village, 150 houses, good supplies. Zaidel, belongs to a sister of Kuchik Khan. After leaving Zaideh the road is bad, unmetalled heavy mud in rain time or winter, not passable for wheels. It is nearly always raining here. ^ At 12 mile Mahalleh village, small place, poor supplies On leaving Mahalleh road continues as before not suitable for wheels. At 16 miles Maklavan village, 150 houses, some supplies. 3 MASULEH .. .. 16 m. General direction W.- * 4 ro On leaving f ’ J . , Maklavan the road is fairly level, but unmetalled, rough and muddy. Three stream*- are crossed; they are bridged with wooden bridges. In good weather carts could go as far as Mahalleh Talish village at 4 miles, 100 houses, some supplies. Mahalleh Talish is the last village in the plains before reaching the mountains. After leaving Mahalleh Talish (the Talish are a branch of the Shahsavans, so Mahalleh Talish means “Small tillage of the Talish tribe”) the ground begins to slope up to the moun tains ; for the next 2 miles the going is very bad, a sea of mud generally, then come 2 miles of better going, passable for carts but with difficulty owing to the increasing steepness of the gradient. At 8 miles the road enters the mountains, and becomes very bad, less than 2 feet wide in places, occasionally so steep C70GSB * 0562 Route No. VI (e)— contd. that it is cist in steps like a ladder. In these places it is not possible to ride, but mules can pass, and horses can be led. Road continues like this to 16 miles where Masuleh is reached. Masuleh is a large village, almost a town. Supplies fairly plentiful; practically nothing grown locally; the people live by hiring out mules, and also carry in supplies for local sale : Wheat and barley from Khalkhal, rice from Talish, sugar, oil, etc., from Zinjan. Masuleh is an important military position, as it is the junction of three roads :—N. to Khalkhal, E. to Resht, W. to Tarum. It is a good position for defence and dominates the approaches to these roads. Room could be found for a force of at least 1,000 men there. Water good. Mule transport procurable. 4 TARKM .. •• 16 m.

Annotated by Fortescue, 1920. Epitome. General. This is a route which was formerly regularly used by camel and mule caravans except in snowy weather when the Kizil Uzun ravine, stage 4, becomes too dangerous. In 1920,574 Route No. VI (Ji) — contd. however, the districts of Khalkhal, N. of the Kizil Uzun, were in a chronic state of disorder owing to the incursions of Shahsavan and Shatranlu tribesmen, the Pardalis bridge over the Kizil Uzun had been breached some years previously to hinder them from crossing the river, and owing to the prevailing insecurity the route had been abandoned. The Kizil Uzun cuts through the plateau of Khalkhal in such a deep and difficult ravine that this route, and also the trade route via Hirabad and the Shahrud valley to Zinjan, which had like wise been abandoned owing to insecurity, is of little military importance and the strategic line of approach into Persia from the N. lies along the Tabriz-Mianeh-Zinjan road. The route is passable throughout for mules and camels, though stage 4 (see below) is difficult for the latter. Stage &amp; has some steep gradients but the Russians are said to have brought carts as far as stage 3 on the edge of the plateau N. of the Kizil Uzun. From the edge of the plateau S. of the Kizil Uzun the road crosses undulating country to Zinjan and in the dry season, from May to November, it is probably passable for A. T. carts, at any rate beyond Kara Bulaq, stage 4. In winter snow lies for two or three months on these highlands, and the ground is soft and sodden during the thaw. The construction of a road for wheeled traffic across the Kizil Uzun gorge would be a great undertaking. Supplies .—The condition of the villages in stages 1 to 3 is not known, but in stages 4 and 5 the country-side was so devastated by the famine and sickness of 1917-18 and by the depredations of raiders from across the river that many villages were deserted, and those that survived Were so ruined and impoverished that scarcely any supplies were available and a force of 50 men and animals would have experienced difficulty in living on the country. Total distance .—Distances are given in hours. 6 hrs. Passing the citadel of Ardabil, now some times used as a State'Route No. YI (A) — contd. prison, the road crosses the Buluk Su by a stone bridge at the small village of Dashkashan, leads left-handed past a circular lake (Shurl Gul) and gradually ascends over undulating country, which falls away N.-E. to the plain and is intersected by partly ■dry watercourses. The ground is everywhere cultivated ; a few villages, Sardab, Alaschandi, etc., are passed to the right. The wide valley of the Kara Su is reached after a ride of nearly 6 hours. On the eastern heights of the valley is the village of Mihmandust, and after another hour’s march reach Kuraim, which consists of 200 houses and is situated on the left bank of the river. Height above sea estimated at about 4,500 feet. 2 JANDCHAI .. 5 hrs. The road goes steeply up the E bank of the 11 hrs. Kara Su.. After T| hours’ march pass a narrow valley and a small village, and, after another steep ascent, soon reach the pass (about 5,700 feet) over the watershed between the drainage areas of the Aras and the Kizil Uzun. The descent to the village of Sanava (about 100 houses) is made through pastures with grazing cattle and fields, which have been made wherever the ground permits. The fields in the valley are well irrigated by canals. The fertile district of Khalkhal begins here. After another hour and a quarter halt at Jandchai in a side valley. 3 ABVAR .. .. 5 hrs. The road leads over (5,300'). low hills to the village 16 hrs. of Biz, and then through a deep ravine past another village on to an undulating plateau, from the highest point of which an extensive view is obtained. This march took 8 hours. 4 KARA BULAQ .. Beyond Abvar the road drops off the } irS ' edge of the plateau above the Kizil Uzun ravine and descends for If hours by a winding path down a steep cliff, a drop of 2,200 feet. In the narrow valley flows the Kizil Uzun, rapid and about 45 yards wide. It is spanned by the Pardalls bridge which resembles the Oafilan Kuh bridge on the Mianeh-Zinjan road and G arched high in the centre above 60' above the river. It is built of stone and brick with 6 arches and is 70 paces along. The 2 central spans.576 Route No. VI (h) — contd. which are the largest and one of which, except during abnormal floods, takes the whole river, which is contracted in a narrow and deep channel, have been destroyed by the KhalkhalTs and one support damaged. The breach could be repaired by building up the support and throwing across a pole bridge. The river is fordable at several places when low but otherwise must be crossed by rather a difficult ford at Maman (about 3 miles upstream). From the bridge the track ascends the opposite cliff, 2,600' high, by zigzags. The narrow path leading close along precipices is somewhat dangerous, especially when two caravans meet, and there is barely room for 2 laden pack animals to pass. When covered with snow the passage of the ravine is too difficult to be attempted. After the top is reached the road runs over an undulating cultivated plateau, still slightly uphill for some time, till the watershed between the Kizil Uzun and its tributary, the Zinjan Rud, here almost parallel to it, is crossed. Thence a gentle descent to Kara Bulaq (100 houses). 5 The distance from 6 Kara Bulaq to Zinjan, 7 _ is about 49 miles • ZIKJAN .. 49 along a good road m. over undulating coun try with no considerable gradients. Akkhaneh is passed at 2 m. This is the largest village of the Kaghuzkunan district of Khal- khal, a long narrow strip, running along the S. of the Kizil Uzun from near Jamalabad on the MTaneh-Zinjan road eastwards to Tarum. Akkhaneh was a flourishing place of about 500 houses, but is now reduced to about 120 and is surrounded by ruins. Beyond Akkhaneh for about 20 miles the road passes few inhabited places. Khairabad (30 houses) is off the road to the right (about 10 miles from Kara Bulaq). It belongs to Salar Majid, and the inhabitants are thieving and inhospitable. Barundeh, at 11 miles, also to the right of the road, is a wretched pile of ruins with only about 8 households remaining. No other in habited villages are passed until about 20 miles, where the road has reached the dreary open basin of the Zinjan Bud. From here there is a choice of routes ; one to the left goes along the edge of the hills bounding this basin and passed several small villages, where side valleys debouch from the hills and provide water for irrigation.Route No. VI (h)~concld.

From MANJIL to MIANEH via KIZIL UZUN Valley. Distance 144 miles. 8 stages. Authorities and dto—Lieutenant Lancaster, l 2nd Gurkha Rifles ; Captain L. S. Fortescue,- June 1920.. Epitome. I. A. General Description .-—The valley of the Kizil TJzun runs in a general direction N.-W. from Manpl to point where Qivi ChaT River joins it. There it changes direction almost due W. until Qafilan Kilh mountains are reached. It then turns off in a southerly direction through a gorge. The height of the river- hed above sea-level is 1,050 feet at Manjil, 1,800 feet at Ubar, 2,500 at Kimahil, 3,600 feet atMlaneh. From this it is seen that the river is a rapid one. _ From Manjil to Shahrud valley at Khasareh, the_ Kizil XJzun valley is bounded by high mountains, Amlakash Kuh and Masuleh Krh of Gilan to the N., and by the hills Alvan Kuh and Angur Kuh of Zinjan to S. Masuleh Kuh continues X. from Khasareh, and this range and the Akdagh mountains form the eastern and western boundaries for the Shahrud valley. Akdagh is a high mountain of about 10,000 feet, and sends- out off-shoots and spurs to Kizil Uzrn River. From near Shahrud to near Chalian, the Kizil Uzunis in a deep gorge,, 3 to 4 miles wide, with high plateaux on each side 4,00#1 582 Route No. VI (/r)— contd. to 6,000 feet above sea level. To reach the river, from either side of the plateaux, a steep descent has to be made of 2,500 to 3,000 feet in 1| to 2| miles. These descents are precipitous and difficult. No path follows the course of the river, and only per sons on foot would be able to follow the river-bed and this with dfficulty. The recognised paths are all up on the plateau, some 4 to 6 miles from the river. Above Chalian the valley opens out. To the N. and N.-W- small broken hills gradually fall away towards Mianeh, until the country becomes almost flat and very little higher than the level of the river-bed. To the S. and S.-E. the precipitous character of the gorge continues. There are no recognised chdrvdddr routes following the line of the Kizil Uzun Valley. Tracks lead from village to village practicable only for pack transport, and for camels with ease in Tarum, with* difficulty elsewhere. The whole country between Manjil and Mianeh is passable for infantry, cavalry, mountain artillery and pack transport; but the highlands are under deep snow from Januarv to March. J The Kizil Uzun is usually fordable except from January to June. J B. (i) Manjil-Darram. —-The road is good with no steep gradients, passable for mules and camels, and for first 4 miles for carts. Deep dried-up water channels, which cross the road frequently, might be conyerted into serious obstacles. (n) Darram-Barandak .—The road is passable for mules, and possibly for camels with difficulty in summer, but would be closed by snow from January to March. The road ascends from Darram to Khasareh, then descends 1,000 feet to bed of Shah- rud whence it gradually ascends to pass leading to Barandak. (in) Barandak-Qibleh Buldq. —In summer the road is pas sable for mules, and for camels with great difficulty. In winter it is probably closed by snow from January to March From the plateau to Nimahil the descent has a gradient of about 1 in ;■ , V x ,, S ^!' f c Ce of thls P art is bad and stony. From Nimahil to Mibleh Bulaq there is an ascent of I in 6 until Gizmeh whence the ascent becomes more gradual till Qibleh Bula i is reached at 7,000 feet The road is most difficult.Route No. VI (a)— contd. (iv) Qibleh Buldq-Mmneh.—The road is passable for mules and camels throughout, and for carts as far as Akkand. From January to March it is closed by snow. On the plateau the road is good, but after Ahmadabad it is rough until its junction with the main Zinjan-Tabrlz road. C. From Manjll to Darram the country is bare and devoid of cultivation except in the neighbourhood of the villages. After Darram there are signs of more vegetation, and the plateau generally presents an appearance of rolling downs. The gorge throughout is steep and broken by rocky ravines, and devoid of grass or cultivation. Owing to the heat and to the presence of sand-flies and mos quitoes, the Manjil-Darram valley, the region of Nimahil in the Kizil Uzun gorge, and the Jamalabad district are unhealthy in summer. D. Intermediate Halting-places. —The journey Ubar-Baran- dak might be done in 3 stages, viz .—- 1. Ubar-Barram .. .. ..18 miles. 2. Darram-Khasareh .. .. .. 10 miles. 3. Khasareh-Barandak .. .. .. 10 miles. The journey Akkand to Mlaneh might be made in 2 days, viz .—• (a) 1. Akkand-Ushar vii Maman ford .. 20 miles. 2. Ushar-Mianeh to left bank .. .. 10 miles. (b) 1. Akkand-Jamalabad .. ..13 miles. 2. Jamalabad-Mlaneh .. .. 12 miles. 2. Drinking Water .—Good drinking water can be obtained from the numerous streams throughout the route for the whole year except between July and November, when the supply is iikely to diminish to some extent. In winter this supply is sufficient for 5,000 men and 1,000 animals. There are abundant springs of drinking water, which, however, are liable to become dry during years of exceptionally light rainfall. No special gear is necessary for the watering of animals except buckets and troughs at springs. 3. Supplies .—Except at Mianeh, where supplies for a mixed force of 5,000 are available, the remainder of the country is incapable of sustaining a force of more than 200 men. Owing to the suspicious inhospitable nature of the villagers, it would584 Route No, VI (£)— contd. probably be necessary to commandeer supplies. In the Tarum district available supplies might be obtained through the Gov ernors of Upper and Lower Tarum. These officials live at Banari and Altunkush, and control 110 and 65 villages respec tively. Supplies are less scarce in the Upper than the Lower Tarum district. Owing to local disorders, the question of obtain ing supplies in the Khalkhal district is particularly difficult. In the N. Khalkhal area a force of 200 men might sustain itself locally by extensive commandeering, but in the S. a force of 50 men would have difficulty in doin^ so. 4. Transport .-—Pack transport, mules and donkeys, working along the Gilan-Zinjan routes pass Ubar and Darrang but except in these localities the collection of any considerable transport on this route may be regarded as wholly impracticable. Six or seven small boats used for the crossing of the Kizil Uzun are available between Manjil and Darram. Upstream of Darram none are available. 5. Fuel .—Fuel in large quantities is available nowhere along the route, as the villagers grow only sufficient poplar trees to provide for their own consumption/ They import charcoal for their own needs from Gi’an. 6. Grazing .—There is no grazing for animals between Manjil and Darram. From Darram to Qivi grazing is plentiful on the plateaux above the Kizil Uzun between the months of April and July. 7. Obstacles .'—The road presents no obstacles to men or pack mule transport except during the winter months when it is blocked by snow. To make the road passable for wheel transport, it would have to be entirely re-graded and re-made. The Kizil Uzun is fordable for men and animals as stated in I. A. 8. Additional Work Necessary .—The question of road-making in the Kizil Uzun Valley requires expert opinion. The con struction of a route fit for any wheeled transport above Darram would be very difficult and costly. 9. Camping Grounds .—Camping grounds for a force of 5,000 men and 1,000 animals can be found everywhere along the route. Snow in winter would make camping difficult and unpleasant in the highlands.Route No. YI (£)— contd. 10. Communications .—- (a) Road. —There are numerous tracks crossing this route into Gilan and Azarbaljan. Of these the principal i. Track from Manjillron Bridge in mountains to ’Ahabad and looping back into main Kazvin-Resht road at Rudbar. ii. Regular mule track from Zinjan into Gilan crossing Kizil Uzun at Vanisar Ferry to TJbar. Hi. Main camel and mule track Zinjan into Gilan, crossing river at Chavarzak to Darram. Camels can go eight miles beyond Darram. _ iv. Mule track from Khasareh to Ardabil via Shanrud valley. Said to be passable for carts in certain sections between Hirabad and Ardabil. v.

The people of the Tamm district are, on the whole, friendly, but unwilling to afford assistance. The right bank of the Kizil Uzun is more thick y populated than the left. The Khalkhal district was formerly thickly populated, but has recently suffered much at the hands of raiders from the N., and through sickness and famine. The villagers of Barandak and Khaiial ad are hostile, but the remainder are probably friendly but suspicious of strangers. There are a few Sunni villages in KhalkbaL 12.

(c) Midneh Region.— Summer : Hot and unhealthy. Winter : Cold with snow. la. J.ains and Floods. —In the plateau region between Janu ary and March snow would render the country towards Akkand and Hisha’in almost impracticable for any kind of transport. Deep water channels, caused by occasional cloud bursts, intersect tracks between Manjil and Darram. They are nor mally dry. 14. Tactical, (i) The Kizil Uzun Valley forms a great natural barrier between Azarbaijan and Gilan, and the rest of Persia. This barrier is composed of three sections, viz .— Eastern : High mountains with difficult passes into Gilan bordering the Kizil Uzun on the E. from Manjil to the Shahrud Valley in Khalkhal. Central: Gorge of KizilUzun River from Shahrud valley to Chalian through Khalkhal. Western : Qaffian Kuh ridge and broken hills near Mianeh. (n.) For an enemy advancing from the N., these combined form a very serious obstacle, and only three lines of advance are open, viz. — (a) Main Tabriz-Zinjan road. (b) Tiack Ardabil-Zinjan via Maman ford near Pardalis Bridge. (c) Track Ardabil-Zinjan and Manjil via Shahrud Valley, crossing Kizil Uzun at Darram. (a) is known. W ^ paragraph 10 (a) r. This road being passable for pack transport only, precludes the idea of a large force rely in cr on it for their only L. of C. } ° (c) Vide paragraph 10 (a) iv. The same remarks apply to this as to route (b). * 1 •' The natural obstacles to be surmounted, combined with the rr,r Stl0r : ° f SUppli , eS and ex P° sed L- °f C., Suld deter the boldest and most pushing commander from attempting an advance m force by Route (b) or (c).Route No. VI {k)—contd. A guerrila force, however, of 200 to 300 men can always move from Gllan into Tamm, living on the country. So also could a similar force from Ardabil, but in this case they would have to come to terms with the Shahsavans. {Hi.) The following positions would be of great importance in opposing an advance of an enemy from the N. along these three routes—- (а) The Qa'ilan Kuh position. (б) The fords at Challan, Maman, Mmdajlm, Mazreh Gizvan, Darram, Tashvish, Shah Maidan and Pardalis Bridge. Each of these should be watched by a few men, keeping a mobile reserve at say Kara Bulaq and Taham. A few men could keep back 100 at all of these places, so difficult are the ascents from the Kizil Uzun. In the case of a guerilla force from Gllan attempting to enter Tarum, the occupation of the following villages would be of value : Ubdr, at bottom of pass leading to Shaft, and a village of 200 houses, good water and supplies for 200 men : Darram, on main Zinjan-Gilan route via Masuleh with w r ater and supplies for 150 men, situated on a hill 50 to 70 feet above surrounding country : Qilivdn, 18 miles from Manjll with poor water and supplies, 80 houses. The occupation of these villages would prevent the enemy from crossing the Kizil Uzun, and possibly deter him from coming into Tarum at all. All these villages are on the left bank of the river. Occupation of villages on the other bank would have little or no effect. {iv.) Spurs consisting of series of low hills running down to Kizil Uzun at Fort Imamzadeh Qasim, about 10 miles from Manjll, would make a good defensive position on the left bank for a force defending Manjil valley against an enemy attempting to force his wmy to Manjil via valley of Kizil Uzun. (U) The L. of C. of a force defending the Kizil Uzun valley would probably be :— Zinjan to Qafilan Kuh. Main road, carts and motors. Zinjan to Kara Bulaq. Pack transport. Carts after a little work on road. Zinjan to Taham. Pack transport. Manjil to Kazvin. Main road. Manjil to Darram. Pack transport.588 Route'N o. VI (/ )— contd. There are numerous easy summer tracks leading all ovet the triangle Zinjan-Kajal-Qafilan Kuh Bridge. With the exception of the regular routes via Taham, tracks from Zinjan to Kizil Uzun are said to be very difficult. 15. Alternative Routes .—A. Barandak^to Mianeh in 4 stages—- 1. Garhaz .. .. .. .. 16 miles. 2. Qabagh .. .. .. .. 16 miles. 3. Hishavar .. .. .. .. 16 miles. 4. Mianeh .. .. .. .. 24 miles. This route is 16 miles longer than the main route, and is fit for pack transport, but is said to be a little difficult between Hishavar and Mianeh, where it leads over a pass about 6,500 feet. Country is mostly bare and desolate, and has suffered much from depredations by the Shahsavans. Supplies and fodder are scarce throughout except at Garhaz where they are available in moderate quantities. Water is plentiful throughout. B. Another alternative route from Manjil to Mianeh is via Darram and Zinjan and thence by the main Ka vin-Tabriz road. This route is 27 miles longer than the main route, and is probably the easiest from Manjil to Mianeh. Supplies and trans port are more easily obtainable locally. 16.

The road leaves Manjil at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The surface is hard throughout, but it is much broken by deep wide dried-up water channels. There are no long gradients. Up to mile 4 the road is passable for A. T. carts, after which it is only a pack track. At mile 13 is the hamlet and ferry of Shah Maidan. There is no water en route except from the river, which is thick with silt until autumn, and one small well. Gibran is a village of 80 houses. Water is available from a spring. Supplies are-scarce.2 UBAR ^Ioute No. YI (£)— contd. . . 18 TO. 35 to. General direction N.-W. The road is stony and indifferent^ and fit only for pack transport. It passes through ravines and small broken hills, and is only a track from village to village. The following villages are passed— Zaitardbdd, 130 houses ; at 10 miles: Kcihriz, 50 houses ; at 12 miles: and Qciriicho/i, 60 houses; at 12 miles. Water is obtainable from small clear streams at all villages en route. Ubar is 3 miles from the Kizil Uzun. There is alerry in the vicinity opposite Vanisar. At Ubar, 200 houses, there are supplies for 200 men, and water is available from a big spring. 3 BAKARl ..28 m. 4 VtJ flbm # General direction N.-W. The road leaves Ubar at an altitude of 2,400 feet, and rises to 4,500 at Banari. Camels can travel •without difficulty to Darram, beyond which it is a mule track. It is rather stony, and crosses numerous water channels. The surrounding country is deserted, the only village passed being Darram (50 houses) at mile 18, where there is a ferry, good water, and supplies for 100 to 150 men. Several small clear streams are passed eri route. Scanty supplies are available at Banari, which lies 2 or 3 miles off the road up in the hills. 4 BAB ANDAK .. 15 to. i o /ro. _ , General direction N.-N.-W.

At mile 6, road crosses the Shahrud, which is 20 feet wide and 10 inches deep in June. The road then ascends a side valley.. The country is deserted and no villages are passed. Barandak is a village of 200 houses in a fertile, well- watered valley under the Akdagh, with good water and supplies for 200 men. The inhabitants are unfriendly to foreigners. They have hitherto defended themselves against Shahsavans and Barandak is almost the only prosperous village left in Khalkhal.Route No. VI {k) — concld. General direction N.-W. The road is a good one over grassy plateau, gradually descending to main Kazvm-Tabriz road, which is followed into Mianeh. If desired, this march may be done in 2 stages :— 1. Akkhaneh-Jamalabad. 2. Jamaiabad-Mianeh. Between Akkhaneh and the main Kazvin-Tabrxz road no sup« plies nor water are available, except at Ushar, 3 miles E.-N.-E. of Qafilan Kuh Bridge, which has a good spring. ROUTE NO. VI(0. From BILEH SAVAR to KAZYIN via ARDABIL, Authority and date .—Professor Zolotareff, 1903. Epitome. General .—This route may be_ regarded as suitable for the movement of a small force, and, as far as Ardabil, practicable only for mountain artillery. Professor Zolotareff in his “ Mili tary Geographical Account of the Frontiers of Russia,” published bv direction of the Russian Directorate of Military Schools and Colleges, 1903, mentions the existence of this road from Bileh Savar to Kazvin via Ardabil. Bileh Savar lies on the Perso- Russian frontier, some 55 miles S.-W. of Baku. The first section, Bileh Savar to Ardabil, crossing the Kara Dagh range, is 80 miles bv map. Many routes connect at Ardabil, the most important* being the lateral communication Tabriz-Ardabil- Astara [Lateral Route No. VI(m). The second section, Aradbil to Kazvin, is fit for field artillery and 175 miles in a straight line, by map. (As the line of this road is not known, this section is not shown on the Index Map.) Comparing the line of operations from Julfa (Main Route No. VI) with 'that starting from Bileh Savar, we see that the former is a direct continuation of the routes from Kars, Alexan- dropol and Erivan, passes dthrough Tabriz, and undoubtedly forms the best line for an advance, but it lies at a considerable distance from the Caspian Sea, which it approaches only at592 Route No. VI (?)— contd. Kazvlu . the Ardabll route starts from the province of Bahfi, traverses only the extreme eastern portion of Azarbaijan. does not touch Tabriz and is a worse road. It, however, lies near the Caspian (the distance being only from 40 to 50 miles). De Morgan says that communication in the Kaia Dagh range is interrupted in winter by snow. ROUTE NO. VI (m).

This is not a regular caravan route, and only small supplies are obtainable from the villages. Water-supply good. No. of stage anil total distance. * 20 Details. 1 KHWAJA .. 20 m. N.-E. On quitting ■ Tabriz, the road for 20 m. about 1 mile runs along the right bank of the Busmieh river, and then ascending approaches the hills to N.-E. of the city. At 6 miles reach the summit of the ascent, which is stony, and in some places ex ceedingly steep. The descent is shorter and less steep than the ascent, and leads into a fine, cultivated valley. The road level and free from stones. The village of Khwaja contains about 60 or 70 houses. Holmes travelled via Burinj (6 miles), and men tions passing village of Ghainband, of some 20 houses, about 12 miles, situated on left, at foot of hills; he also crossed a brackish but drinkable rivulet. Both accounts mention the Aji Chal, a fordable salt river. Holmes calls the country barren.Route No. Yl (m)~^contd. 2 KUZl or KIZlL .. 20 m. N.-E.

Afterwards gently undulating ground, a range of snowy mountains bearing S.-S.-E. The road level and passable for carriages. Holmes crossed a stream several times, and came across a rivulet, the waters of which were said to be fresh and good. He only saw one village, Shahsavar, about 18 miles from Khwaj a. ahAr 65 m. 2o m. N.-E. The road gradually descends from Kizil Kapan • 11 , AXCCJJCl'JLJ. into a valley. At 3 miles, a ruined caravansarai marks the bey In ning of a gentle ascent about 1 mile in length, by the side of a small stream ; the descent for 3 miles is more abrupt. A ruined caravansarai stands at the foot of the pass. One mile beyond the road turns to the E., and follows the course of the Ahar river on its right bank. A range of hills to the N. sprinkled with snow. The road after clearing the pass is excellent, being hard, level and free from stones. Much cultivation. Wheat and barley on both sides of the river. Half a mile before reaching Ahar, ford the river, and ascend a slight rise to the village. MacGregor makes this march only 20 miles. 4 QISHLAQ .. 10 m. S. 80° E. At 4 miles the road crosses tire 75 m - stream of Ahar (ford able), and continues on its S. bank. From 4 miles to 10 miles a rich tract of country occurs, called Savalan Shami, about 6 miles in length and 4 in breadth, covered with cultivation except in the vicinity of the river, which is reserved for pasturage. A range of mountains called Shaivak, distant about 8 miles to the N. of the road. At 9 miles past villages of 'Tivilehand Tazeh hand both on opposite bank of Ahar, latter containing 20 or 30 houses’ Crossing tne Ahar, the road passes over a succession of ridges and ravines, which descend to the river from the Khashka ranges C7 °GSB ' 2m594: Route No. VI (m) — contd. distant about 4 miles on the right, and crosses several small streams. Qishlaq is a village built on a small eminence, one side of which forms a precipice overhanging the river and contains about 30 houses. 5 SAUJ BULAQ .. 14 m. A small village to the left of the road, situa- 89 m. ted on the pinnacle of an isolated hill, at the foot of which flows the Ahar stream. It is surrounded by a wall, and contains about 20 poor huts. Soon after passing Qishlaq, the road again crosses to left bank. At this point the valley becomes narrow, varying from 100 to 300 yards. The hills which have hitherto presented smooth and rounded summits now exhibit a more rugged outline. The road winds round their sides, which, sometimes nearly meeting at the base, leave only a narrow chasm for the stream, here so confined as to become a foaming torrent. 6 YANGIJA .. 9 m. S. 80° E. For the first 4 miles, the road is 98 m. uneven and stony, over hills on the right bank of the stream. At 4 miles the road quits the river which flows to the N.-E. to join the Kara Su. At 7 miles pass the village of Mizar, containing about 20 houses situated on the spur of a hill to the right. After leaving the river the road leads over undulating ground sloping to the N., and richly cultivated with wheat and rice.— (Todd.) Holmes, who halted at Mizam, which is evidently the Mizar of Todd, appe^s to have travelled by the left bank of the Ahar as far as the 'villa :es of Ghaindangi and Kalabashi. He there crossed the river, and, after continuing a few miles along its right bank, came, in about 2 miles, over undulating ground covered with dwarf oaks and shrubs, to Mizam. 7 NASHRC’BAD .. 13 m.

ROUTE NO. VI (w). From ENZELl to ASTARl. »tt*V . jnoo Distance 88 miles. ‘ stages. Authority and date.—Tiott, February 1919. Epitome. 1. Passabilily .—The road is at present simply a series of mule tracks running parallel to the sea shore at an average distance of not more than 500 yards from the sea. It is not passable for lorries or heavy guns. At present it is not passable for Ford nans as the rivers Shafarud,Naukandeh and Vatigan are deep enough to cause water to flood the carburettor. The inhabitants say that from May to January thesi?^ of these rivers decreases con siderably and the road would then be passable for Ford vans with difficulty. In this case a few places need ramping and bushes need cutting away as noted in the detailed report. A. T. Carts could now get through with difficulty, doing not more than 10 miles per day. Inhabitants say that the road is occasionally closed in the spring after heavy rain, as the rivers swell and make even the passage of mules and horses impossible. This never lasts (they say) for more than 6 days at a time. Mules and horses and troops can get through always with the above exception. 16J m. . i U^m.

Two lines are Russian : these are destroyed especially near Enzell and Sangachin. One single line is used by the Lionosoff Fisheries : and two belong to the Persian Telegraph Company and are very much in need o £ repair. Poles have in many places fallen down. There i s a branch line leading off from Shafarud in the direction of Panel. A telegraph station is at Shafarud : it is now working. 4. Supplies. —AH convoys going along this road must take barley with them from En/Mi. Straw can be bought at most places on the road but it is very inferior. There are small bazaar's at various places on the road but rice and wood are the only things procurable in large quantities. The former can be found in large quantities at Kapurchal and Shafarud : the latter almost anywhere, especially at Tularud and near Khatbesara. Apples and pears are also to be got in small quantities especially at Karghanrud. The forest contains a large number of pig i ducks are also plentiful. Cattle are plentiful but only a few sheep. 5. Water —-Is drinkable everywhere but should 'be boiled. That from the Altaian river is said by the inhabitants.to be in digestible although they drink it; with boiling it is quite good. That from the Shafarud river is also slightly brackish. 6. Camping Grounds —Are very extensive at. the mouths of the various rivers and especially at Tula ud. 7. General. —The climate in summer time is very unhealthy, the shore districts being infested with mosquitoes and, sand flies all the inhabitants except Custom officials and the fishermen migrate 10—20 miles into the interior'.among the foothills for thd summer from May to September.598 Rotue No. YI (n) — contct. 8. Railways.—At Tularud, near Galabin and from Batageh to Astara are light railways (2 feet i inch gauge). 9. .Ft'^/im'es.—Fishing stations of Lionosoff are to be found all along the shore. 10. Transport.—A few small flat-bottomed boats are owned by fishermen on the Enzeli Lagoon ; also large boats, all at Astara. No mules or donkeys are ordinarily obtainable on the route. Big boats up to 50 tons are said to be able to stand in close to the shore near the River Hevik’s mouth and also near Tularud. 11. Fv r i —Ls plentiful everywhere. 12. Qradn/j —ds everywhere plentiful and good for horses and cattle. No grazing for camels, which are seldom (if ever) Seen on the route. 13. Additional tvork necessary. —To make a metalled road would be a difficult and lengthy task as there are no stones. Many bridges would also have to be built over the various streams, nearly all of which are said to be perennial. . 14. Communications.—Foot paths lead all over the jungle. The road leading inland to Khalkhal and Haru from Siahchal is mentioned in the detailed report. 15. Alternative Routes. —Mr. C. Jereme of the Astara Customs says there is another road which skirts the foothills further inland, about 20 miles inland in some places. 16. Transport Hire. —Persian mules are the only kind of transport used by the inhabitants : their hire is very dear owing to the scarcity of barley. Eighteen to 20 Krans a day is the minimum rate per mule usually paid. No. of stage I and total | Details, dsunoe. , * 10 1 SANGACHIN .. 10 m.

Epitome. 1. General. —(a) Brief description of route .—Route is best considered in two parts, viz., (1) Astara-Ardabil and (2) Arda- bil-Tabiiz. (1) Astaia-Ardabil is a metalled chaussee built by a Persian engineer about nine years ago. It is not now' properly looked606 Route No. VI {jp) — contd. after although a company still collects tolls from caravans. The surface is paved with very large stones making the going very load. It was originally intended to build the road through Nuna- karan but, owing to difficulties with the owner of that village, it was taken through Arpatappeh instead, making the gradients much worse and taking the road over the summit of the Has! Amir mountain instead of round it. Road is now passable for horses, mules, camels and A. T. carts, the last named with difficulty on the top of the Hasi Amir pass. Now impassable for motor cars and heavy lorries. (2) Ardabil-Tabriz is only a mule track with a few bridges constructed 100—200 years ago :• road is unmetalled. Passable now for horses, mules, camels and (if the Imam Chal route be taken) for A. T. carts with difficulty from May—December.. Now impassable for motors, cars, and heavy lorries. (b) Passable between — Astara-Hairan for heavy lorries, motor cars and A. T. carts. Hairan-Arpatappeh. A. T. carts with great difficulty, camels and mules. Arpatappeh-Ardabll. Motor cars, A. T. carts (not lorries). Ardabil-Nir. Motor cars and A. T. carts (not lorries). Nir-Suyun. Mules and horses (not carts now). (The Imam Chai route is said to be passable for.carriages and A. T. carts from May—December). Passable between— Suyun-Kurdkandi. Motor cars and A. T. carts (not lorries). Kurdkandi-Shibli. Camels, mules and horses ; from May—- December will be passable for Ford vans and A. T. carts. Shibli-Tabriz. Motor cars and A. T. carts (not lorries). The road could easily be made impassable between Kham- bula [I and Varid by blowing up or demolishing with hatchets, etc., the two wooden bridges mentioned below. In this case, however, there is another road on the N. Russian side of the Astara Chal and this could be used instead. There are no facilities for making the road impassable by flooding : and to demolish the bridges between Ardabil and Tabriz would only make the road impas sable for two or three days at a time, during March or April when the river happens to be in flood.Route No, VI (p)— contd. (c) Passes, etc .—Four difficult passes are met with, as noted below :— viz. : The Hasi Amir, the Sayln, the Gumbahan and the Shibli. The last named is the highest and is covered with snow from December to March : but the large amount of caravan traffic along the Tabriz-Mianeh road usually keeps the surface open for mules and camels. The Sayln pass is often difficult with drifted snow from February—March but never actually impassable. The alternative Imam Chai route, while passable for carts in summer, is more difficult and dangerous from January—April on account of snow drifts. The route starts in an unhealthy neighbourhood, as the Caspian littoral is infected with mosquitoes from April—Novem ber, and fever is then very common. Bugs and vermin are also plentiful at Yarld. (cl) Possible intermediate halting 'places .-—In the stages taken between Sarab and Duzduzan it is possible to halt at Chirlu or Behraman. . Between Ardabil and Nir, the best places are Almas and Shah Bula p Between KurdkandT and ShibF, the only place is Arishtanab. Between Shibli and Tabriz is Kizilja Maidan. miles.

Sufficient for 1 brigade of infantry and 300 animals. Supply said to be permament and always drinkable. Between Kir and Sarab there is not very much water. 3. Supplies.—Large quantities of grain cannot now be found on this route, as the Turks took away all they could from the district Tabriz-Ardabil (inclusive) last autumn. At Ardabil and Sarab are still small stocks of barley, wheat and straw. Grass (the local product known as yugi) can be bought in small quantities at all the villages : there is no straw or hay at all at Duzduzan nor barley at Kizilja Maidan : at this last place there are hardly any supplies left. After the harvest there should be large stores of grain at Ardabil and Sarab. Astara has large stocks of good rice. Sheep and cattle are plentiful at Ardabil; at Sarab and Ardabil are small quantities of fruit: vegetables can not be found in large quantities. Bazaars at Ardabil and Sarab. 4. Local Transport. —Kone except at Ardabil, where mules and camels are sometimes available ; probably not more than 200 mules and 800 camels could be got at one time. 5. Fuel. —-Plentiful at Astara : between Hairan and Ardabil very little: at Ardabil plentiful, and at Sarab, Kurdkandl- and Arishtanab. Very scarce from Arishtanab to Saidabad, 6. Grazing. — {a) Horses and cattle : now none except a little in the vicinity of Astara : said to be some at Ardabil, Shamasbl, Arishtanab and Kizilja Maidan from June to December. (6) Camels.. —Good grazing from The HasI Amir pass to Arda bil and also from Sarab-Kurdkandl; continues all the year round. 7. Obstacles. —Snow drifts at HasI Amir and Sayln passes : also heavy mud near Shibll-Sayln Pass which has a very difficult surface. See detailed report. 8. Additional work necessary. —To keep the'HasI Am trip ass clear would require 50 coolies constantly engaged under supervi sion. For motor lorries a new chaussee would have to be cut with easier gradients and through. Nunakaran. From Ardabil to Tabriz a chaussee would have to be made for permanent passage of motor cars and field guns. Metalling for the road surface Is plentiful except between Suyun and Gumbahan. To make a passable road for cars over the Savin and Gumbahan passes would take 6 months’ work.Route No. YI (p)—contd. 9. Camping grounds. —See detailed report. Two battalions could be marched through the road without difficulty with regard to camping grounds. 10. Communications. —Ardabil is the centre of several routes, S. into Khalkhal and N. up to the Russian frontier and Moghan and Bilasvar : considerable trade takes place along these routes, quantities of sheep especially being sent towards the frontier. All are mule tracks. Sarab has also a route which crosses the Buzgush range to the S. and goes to Mianeh : track is somewhat difficult. The main Tabriz-Mianeh-Zinjan road joins near Shibli, No railways: no navigable rivers or canals. Single telegraph line from Astara-Ardabil now working : owned by Persian company : telephone is on the line at Baharistan. Single telegraph line from Ardabil to Sarab : office now working at Sarab : this line after Sarab goes S. over the Buzgush Mountains to ; MTaneh via Vatigan. 11. Rain and Floods. —Rivers are swollen in March and April but route is never closed. Vicinity of Sarab is very muddy in these months, making passage of motor cars and A. T. carts difficult but not impossible. 14. Tactical.—There are no strong natural positions. The ridge of the Shibli Pass could be held easily against an enemy attacking Tabriz from the S. : and if the Hasi Amir Pass were held an enemy based on Astara would have considerable difficulty in advancing to Ardabil. 12. Alternative routes. —From Nir to Suyun there is an alternative course to the S. via Imam Chai: the gradients here are easier than those of Savin but in the winter from Decem ber to April the route is considered dangerous owing to drifted snow.

The road passes over many culverts over small ditches; culverts are of wood planking laid, transversely across four long beams laid in the direction of the road’s length: all would bear a Peerless lorry. At U miles come to village Khoshkadana : a small village of 15 houses ; many rice fields and unlimited camping grounds near the Astara Chai. At 2 m. Batgesara : 90 houses, 12 shops, 2 mills for grinding rice, good camping grounds. At 4 miles cross over wooden bridge over a deep ravine 20' below. Bridge* is of wood planks, support ed by struts from the perpendicular sides of the ravine : breadth 1 8 yards and length is 5 yards : this would be a serious obstacle if destroyed, as it easily could be. Just before getting to Bibandi road slopes up for 100 yards and then down over a similar slope. At 5 miles Bibandi: a village of 10 houses with a Customs House and a tea shop. Road leads in general direction of S.-W.; surface uneven with large stones. At 4 mile from Bibandi pa^s over stone bridge over a ravine 40' deep ; roadway is 4 yards wide. The ravine is nearly built over with stones there being only a small arch left at the bo.tom, 4 yards long by 12 ft. high. At 1 mile pass small village of Kasnbi, 8 houses. At 3 miles the road is beginning to rise and the Zastava or toll gate of Kholtobarin is passed. At 8 miles k ha ubulaqi, 30 houses, 2 tea shops; very good water from Asta a C ai which is here a mountain torrent. Camp ing ground very limited : not more than 2 platoons infantry could be camped here. Stone bridge : passable for lorries and heavy guns. Road now begins the long ascent of the Hasi Amir Pass : road winds along the sides of the mountains sloping down into the valley of the Astara Cha r . At J mile a wooden culvert with a board missing in the centre ; needs repairs. Then over winding road to bridge over the Meshind river. Bridge is of transverse planking, 15 yards long by 5 wide, supported on trestles of wood spanning ravine, bottom of whicfris 30' below. Parapet of 3 rails 3' high. Bridge is passable tor lorries, heavy guns and all lighter traffic.Route No. Vl{ T )—contd. Bridge is passable for lorries and heavy guns. At 11 miles Baharistan. General direction S. by W. Road winds uphill to the Agha Chal which joins the main river at 2J miles. Road in places is very bad owing to big stones and earth having fallen on the road from the precipitous sides of the hill. Agha Chal is crossed by a wood bridge 10 high, 7 wide and 5' long, composed of transverse planking supported by struts fixed to the sides of the valley. Then a stiff ascent over zig-zag into Varid. Ascents are slopes of with the corner of the zig-zag verjr sharp and awkward. At 4-2 miles passover newly made stone bridge* (one arch) in good repair; width 5 yards, length 6 yards, height 30 feet: no parapet. At 16 miles Varid, a collection of thirty houses. One butcher s shop and three tea shops. Would accommodate k company of infantry in billets ; rooms and houses very dirty. Water from wells needs boiling. No supplies except a little bread. 2 ARPATAPPEH .. 111 m. General direction W. ' 9 ‘ hy S. Road follows f winding chanssee up hill: surface still paved with big stones but passable for Ford vans. At 1 * 4 miles cross stone bridge of one arch, well-built and new ; ravine which is bridged is 15 feet below with a small stream of good water at bottom. The arch is 5 yards long and bridge is 8 yards wide : no parapet. At 12|- miles Hairan, now a collection of the burnt-out re mains of 60 houses scattered somewhat widely apart. Here is good camping ground on slopes of hill for 1 battalion infantry. Up gradient over zig-zag chaussee as before,* country now becomes barren, with few trees : only bushes. Gradients have sharp sudden turns : and the gradients are in some places J, Everywhere the going over the uneven surface is difficult and there is also a strong gusty wind which blows towards the sea down the road from the W : this makes the going for Ford cars difficult and even dangerous as the sides of the hill are precipi tous and the road has no parapet. At 3 miles from Hairan the road has fallen away to leave just room for a Ford car’s wheels. Then pass three well-built stone culverts. At 4| miles from ♦Biiijge of stone is passable for lorries and heavy guns. 2js2612 Koute No. VI(jo) — contd. Hairan road divides : right fork is longer but better: both unite at 5 miles. Here falls of snow lie by the side of the road leaving oniy enough room for a mule or horse to pass : light bullock carts also get through. At 7| miles the HasI Amir Pass is a chaussee made some ten years ago by a Persian engineer : it appears badly designed, as the gradients are very steep and the road is paved with large stones. The road is also taken over the steepest part of the hill : a course further to the S. through Nunakaran would not in volve such steep ascents. The whole road wants cleaning as dropping earth from the steep hillside keeps on silting up the sur face. In places water courses have been worn in the metalling owdng to flood streams. A strong wind equal in force to a gale blows very often towards the sea and it is not uncommon for pack animals to be blown over the unprotected cliff. Wind is said to be especially violent from November to April, but does not blow every day. Down over zig-zag for 1 mile to small tea shop which would accommodate 1 section infantry and 10 horses : this is known as the Khanagavi Suffix. Then on in general direction W, by S. over good surface to Arpatappeh. At 11| miles Arpatappeh : 15 houses with good bala Tcld^eh or rest house with 7 rooms : village would billet 1 company in fantry and 20 horses. Water from 2 springs is good and perennial, 20 cows : no sheep ; soil is fertile; would produce onions and potatoes but at present none are planted. Mutton when wanted is brought from neighbouring village of Khanagavi, two mlfies off. 3 3 AEDABlL .. 16J m Hoad good: general direction W.-S.-W. At 44 m. 2 miles road bifur cates : right fork goes through Salah and is the better road as it has been metalled: left fork goes through Jigakandi (2^ miles from Arpatappeh) and is the shorter. At Jigakandi are 12-15 houses and a river, now muddy but not brackish : both unite again at Khanazar. The country is flat and open. The bridge at Salah is passable for motor lorries and heavy guns. At Salah. there is a river, breadth 10 yards, mossed byRoute No. Nl{ V )—contd. a well-built stone bridge : 2 arches, stone good condition, 8 yards broad roadway, arch 7 feet above water : length of arch 12 feet, piers 5 feet broad. Salah grows a little wheat and barley and has 25 houses : no other supplies : has a rest house built by the Kussians to hold | company with stables adjoining for 30 horses. At 5 miles pass Khanazar. Road open and surface good s has been metalled some years ago : passes over 3 brick culverts which need repair especially at ?- mile before getting to Navadeh. The culverts are now passable for Ford vans and field guns. At 7 miles Navadeh, 50 houses and a customs post: small area under cultivation : open camping ground for | company near the river 200 yards W. of village. Roadjfood an ^ open. At 2d miles from Navadeh pass small village Tazehkand, i mile S. of road : also passover 3 culverts over ditches, all in need of repair : they appear certain to collapse in a year if nothing is done to them. At 3 miles bridge over the Gudi ChaT, a muddy stream which is now fordable with ease : bridge has 2 arches of brick, arches 6 feet high, length of arch 3 yards, breadth of road 5 yards, 1 foot parapet, in fair repair ; passable for Ford vans and 18-pdr. guns. At 101 miles Gilandov, 40 houses and wheat and barley culti vation. Bridge is passable for motor lorries and heavy guns. At 5 miles from Gilandov pass a large bridge over the Gilandov ChaT, stone, 4 arches, 5 yards broad, each arch 4 yards long, height of arch 12' above the river bed: river now 20—30 yards wide, muddy and fordable : bridge passable for lorries and heavy guns. Thence road into Ardabll is broad and good, general direction being W.-S.-W. Town is on the Bolaghli ChaT, the water of which needs boiling' as it is very muddy but other wise drinkable. Camping ground for 2 brigades along the rivet valley. At 16|- miles ArdabTl, a large town, capital of Ardabll Province : Governor’s name AmTr-es-Sultaneh. Said to have 70—80,000 inhabitants and 12,000 houses. Principal exports are wheat and barley and building stone to Astara : also meat (sheep on hoof) to Moghan and Bilasvar on the Russian frontier : imports sugar and oil from Baku and Russia. Also a large quantity of raisins and all dried fruits come from Maragheh, UrumTeh and Tabriz districts : and much of this is exported to Astara. and Baku.614 Route No. VI(2')— contd. 4 KlR .. .. 23 m. Leaving citadel, road first travels N. and N.- 67 m. W. and then turns through the muddy streets of the town skirting the bazaars, and then emerges to general direction of W.-S.-W. Road starts broad and good, not metalled. At 2 miles reach the Shamasbi Bridge near which the going is broken and bad : two culverts broken and road is overflowed by muddy streamlets. Bridge is over the Bolaghll Chai: of brick, with stone bases to the piers, which are crumbling a little. Length over all 40 yards, width 3| yards, parapet 3 feet, 5 arches, each arch 4 yards long, and 15 feet high, piers of stone, base IJ yards thick ; in fair condition, stone paved, will carry 18-pdr. guns and Fo d vans. River is no obstacle except in flood (March—April) : stony bottom, 1 foot deep, 20—30 yards wide : rapid flowing. Water is drinkable. Thence into village ; road near the village is very muddy. At 4| miles Shamasbi, a big village of 200 houses, not much cultivation; 500 trees affording good camping ground near the river: camping ground sufficient for 2 battalions infantry. Bridge passable for Ford vans, 18-pdr. guns and A. T. carts. Road leads in general direction S.-W. by W. : at 11 miles from Shamasbi road is very muddy ; after this the road leads up a shallow ravine passable for Ford cars. At 2 miles from Shamasbi village of Haji Salim Qishlaq, 800 yards N.-E. of road. Haji Salim Qishlaq has a few trees. Good camping ground for 2 companies infantry. At 4 miles road bifurcates. S. branch leading to the Yurchi tribe villages and eventually to Haru. N. branch leads over broken ground and immediately outside the Almas coffee house is a culvert of rotting wood just too narrow for a Ford car : with two 8' planks a Ford car could be got over this. At 8| miles Almas village lies 500 yards S. of road : 1 spring, 60 houses, 12 of which only are occupied : no supplies : coffee house on road. Road leads (direction W.) over bridge over the same river as previous bridge : this bridge is length 28 vards, of brick, stone paved: width 4 yards; 4 arches, each 12' high, parapet 1' 6' but in bad condition. Bridge near Almas is passable for Ford vans, 18-pdr. guns and A. T. carts.Route No. YI(p)— contd. River bed 20—25 yards, now fordable everyAvhere: large stones on bottom. Road then leads parallel to river bed : at 2 miles going is very muddy and broken ; at 4 miles small bridge of rotting planks over the Ak Galaeh streamlet. This bridge is of no use except for foot passengers : the streamlet could easily be crossed by Ford vans and 18-pdr. guns with half an hour’s ramp ing by two men. Going now becomes very stony. At 6 miles cross small river Viandeh by ford passable for 18-pdr. guns and Ford vans : then ascent of | for 100 yards out of the bed of the river ; stony surface needs clearing. Then on and pas? over three streamlets all passable in the same way as the last: and at 9 miles cross a fourth and come to a difficult zig-zag ascent of ) for 50 yards out of the stream bed : an easier way round could be easily made by a detour 100 yards to the N. At 18 miles Shah Bui a y 600 yards S. of main road, has 30 houses, a few trees, good river water: suitable camping place for 2 companies of infantry. Road surface stony but passable for Ford vans and 18-pdr. guns. The road in the village of Nir is very bad and dirty.

There-is a stone -causeway leading up to the bridge on either side : now crumbling: length of arch is 6 yards, height 18 feet : thickness of piers 2^—3 yards, parapet 2 feet: bridge in fair condition. Bridge over p Aghlaga.n‘Cha' is passable for Ford vans. 18-pdr. guns and A. T. carts. 300 yards further on road bifurcates ; left branch leads through Imam Cha’; this route is longer and in winter more dangerous but in summer, when the snow has dis appeared, it is said to be passable for carts. Taking the right branch, come to stony ground : whole surface is covered over wirh616 Route No. VI(p)— contd. large stones making going extremely difficult especially for loaded mules. This piece is impassable for all wheeled transport. One incline of ^ for 600 yards is very stony and, being covered with drifted snow and ice, is very slippery and bad for animals feet. At 5| miles another difficult incline with small coffee shop at top : slope yg, very rough surface. Then ascend over gradual slope over frozen snow to sarai. At 8 miles Shah ’Abbas Sarai ; a well-built erection of squared stone : now contains tea shop : would accommodate 12 horses and 25 men, very crowded. All the district is covered with snow, feet to 4 feet thick. General direction S.-W. Going bad over melting snow: inclines not so steep nor so stony as the other side of the pass : gradually descend into valley in which the village of Ziri lies. Ziri is a small village, nearly all in ruins: 20 houses 600 yards S. of road. In this vicinity road surface becomes very muddy and thick: at § mile beyond Ziri, 800 yards N. of the road is the village Kalian, 50 houses, water from a spring ; possible stopping place for small force but no suitable camping ground; force would have to be billetted. At 7 miles pass over narrow neck of country between two small hills and then descend over ravine valley into Suyun. Road bifurcates 7 miles before village : S. branch follows telegraph poles on into Sarab : N. branch goes to village. This portion (from Nlr-Suyun) is impassable for-all wheeled transport. Suyun, 110 houses: 150 trees; water from a streamlet is rather muddy but drinkable ; 2,000 sheep ; mast, milk, and chickens in plenty : camping ground suitable for 1 brigade of infantry in ground S. of village. 6 6 SARAB .. .. 10 m.

Stream is now 4 yards wide and 3 inches deep : said to be no obstacle even in flood. Road then leads over soft alluvial surface with a large area under culti vation. In first 4 miles cross 3 muddy streamlets, one at 2 miles (opposite village of Gilakava) being especially muddy. Ford vans would here require two 10 foot planks. Road then leads on over good surface rising to small neck at 7 miles; then down to Chirlu, 9 miles. Ch:rlu : 30 houses; water is brought from the Aji Chal almost 1 mile to the S. Village lies 200 yards S. of road : small amount of cultivation; f mile N. is the village of Khatfmabad: 50 houses. Road leads on in general direction W.-S.-W. At 7 miles cross a large flood bed which leads down into the Aji Chal bed from village of Khatunabad : crossing is muddy. Thence read undulates and at 4 miles crosses the main channel of the Aji618 Route No. VIQ»)— contd. Chat. River is here 25 yards tvide, 1 foot deep, pebbly bottom. Ford in floods is said to lie impassable sometimes for a week at a time : caravans can then make a detour via Augan (2 miles S. of ford) where there is a bridge. Thence road good. The valley of the Aji Chai is not very broad and does not look as though it would be a very serious obstacle even in flood. At 15 miles Behraman, about 30 men (formerly much more) '• little cultivation and no supplies. Water from wells is drinkable, i mile S. is the twin village of Gosha! Gumbaz, also nearly ruined, about 20 men. Road leads in general direction W. over good surface with no obstacles : a few gentle up and down gradients. At 7 miles a spring known as Shirln Bula \: a very poor spring, nearly dry. At 24 miles Duzduzan, formerly had 300 houses : now only 50. Yearly crop is 200 k ’tarwars of wheat and barley combined. 500—600 sheep: 40—50 cows and oxen. Water from wells is drinkable, though a little saltish. No straw obtainable for animals. Camping ground in vicinity of village for 2 battalions. 8 8 KURDKANDI .. 9 m. General direction W. • Road good ; surface 128 m. . level : but in wet wea ther going would be very muddy. At 1 mile come to a wooden bridge across a muddy water-course; bridge is 5 yards long, consisting of planks reposing on two tree trunks : just wide enough to take a Ford van : bridge needs repair, being now passable for 18-pdr. guns and unloaded Ford vans but liable to break soon. Water-course is simply a muddy ditch, said to dry up in summer. At 1 mile from Kurdkandi road goes over small de pression in ground making ascents and descents somewhat awkward : these need levelling involving two days’ work for party of 20 men. Otherwise road surface very good and flat. This section is now passable for 18-pdr. guns and Ford vans. Kurdkandi, 150houses: 300—400 cows: about 70 sheep: yearly harvest 350 k'virwdrs of wheat and barley combined : at present probably 100 k^arwdrsin stock. No vegetables. Water good from 1 perennial spring. Ground is fertile ; large area appears to be under cultivation and there are 300 poplar trees. Camping grounds for 1 brigade in the ground S.-W of the village.619 Route No. Vl(p)-~contd. 9 SHIBLl „. ». 19| m. General direction W.* ‘ S.-W. Road at first 147^ m. leads over bridge in village over muddy ditch: bridge is at end of village and is made of two tree trunks with transverse planks : two yards wide : sur face raised 3 feet above general ground level, length 5 yards : this would not bear a Ford van without strengthening. Ditch is said to dry up in summer : a Ford could be got across by means of two strong 8 foot planks. Then on over winding course : at 8 miles road crosses a deep nullah with a passage which requires ramping for carts. Ditch is now dry though bottom is muddy : 12 feet relative depth; could be crossed by a bridge 15 yards long. To ramp would take 10 men 3 hours. Otherwise surface of road is flat but muddy. At 2^ miles cross river Gujan Chal by a ford : E. side of approach to ford is over a low bank 4 feet high : this needs ramping for carts, taking 5 men 1 hour. Ford is stony, firm bottom ; two main streams, each 14 yards across and 1 foot deep, easily crossed. River is now swelling for flood but inhabitants say it is never unfordable : whole flood bed is 130 yards wide. Then pass village Gala, 500 yards S. of road. Gala, 70—80 houses and a few trees : camping ground possible near here for one battalion : village has no supplies. Then gentle up-gradient; surface good till 6| miles where road follows up a watercourse 20—30 yards wide, very sticky and difficult for mules. A road outside and parallel to this nullah could easily be made. Road emerges into thick mud : at 7| miles leave village of Gumbahan 1 mile S.-E. Gumbahan village has 25 houses, situated in barren valley country, water from spring : good and drinkable. Gumbahan caravansarai could accommodate 20 horses and 1 company infantry: water from muddy stream requires boiling. Tea house beside the sarai. Road leads up-hill over general direction W. by S. : gradients difficult up the course of a stream bed : here a road requires cutting as there are several difficult places and awkward twists for carts. Steepest gradient f. Approximately 1 mile of ground needs to be cut: would take party of 30 men 5 days. At 1 mile from the Gumbahan sarai top the Gumbahan Pass : village of Arishtanab visible on a bearing of 285° (Magnetic). Road then leads down over winding course, at one place being620 Route No. VI(^)— contd. 8 feet wide only and crumbling away by erosion of the torrent 30 feet below. This needs revetting with stones or some other means, and the sides of the hill need cutting away. At 1 mile from top leads down difficult twisty gradient of £ for 300 yards : for a permanent road another course would have to be cut. Then cross a ridge by an up-gradient again of | for 200 yards : then down into stream bed again. This ridge could be avoided by cutting a road 300 yards more to the N. following approxi mately the course of the stream. Road surface here muddy. At 12 J miles Arishtanab ; originally had 130 houses but now only 80 are occupied : yearly crop of wheat and barley combined given as 150 kKarwar* ; 80 cows : 300 sheep : good mast and milk : small stock of onions : 12 shops : few trees (about 100).

At 5£ miles meet road from Mlaneh to Tabriz, Main Route No. VI; then on up the winding ascent to Shibll Pass; reach top at 6J miles. Ascent is winding and very muddy but with pushing and careful driving Ford cars and 18-pdr. guns could be got up it. The descent is worse than the ascent : turns are very sharp and gradient : at 7 miles a bridge (1 arch) of stone over a deep water channel. Bridge is stone paved, 6 yards wide, one side beginning to fall away; channel below is 20 feet deep and contains muddy water but dry in summer. Pass now covered in snow. At 101- miles Shibll, 30 houses, 50 cows, small supply of onions&gt; 200 sheep, no stocks of grain beyond immediate requirements up to what harvest produces. Water from wells: drinkable.

At 17 miles there are several springs of good water, surrounded sfonvt 1 luX ™\g ras f- Th e track is good but somewhat y in places. At 17| miles the road crosses a small rounded ridge on the crest of which, commanding the road, are the rains of an old square fort, known as the Kaleh Dabrul Khan, the outline of which is now visible ; the river runs in a bed, 400 yards wide, a J of a mile to the eastward. On the right bank are some gypsum and chalky cliffs overhanging the water and on the left gravelly cliffs 80 to 100' high. From here the road descends a short steep slope, over an easy track amongst con glomerate boulders opening out to view the Vurgatch valley; i a mile broad, bordered to the.S.-E. by a steep range of the same name. At 18 miles at the foot of the incline the Gulail Mulishi stream is crossed, 10 yards broad and 2' deep, coming from the Kuh-i-Kaleh-i-Baghdad to the S.-E. Its waters are brackish and undrinkable. Above this point the river water is sweet. The hills on either side are quite bare. At 20£ miles some ruins, known as Kala Shaikhana, are passed close to the nver at the foot of a, low spur from the right. The valley here narrows to 400 yards. At 21 miles the road descends a sandy stone ledge crossing the valley by a rocky rough descent for 50 yards ; by clearing some of the rough places a good cart road could be made. At the foot of the descent another valley opens out, 600 yards wide. The border hills become more precipitous and rugged and gradually increase in height as we ascend. The river-bed is now 80 to 100 yards wide and is a deep rapid torrent^636 Koute No. YlII(d).~contd. It runs between cliffs of white limestone 25 to 30' high, and the bed is filled with reeds and oleander shrubs. At 21 \ miles the ruins of the old bridge of Pul-i-Surufsha is passed, the greater part of which has been swept away. At 22J miles the Gangir river is forded again about a £ of a mile above the old bridge; the river is 30 yards broad and 2| feet deep with a rapid stream over a gravelly bed, making a difficult ford. A steep cliff comes close to the left bank and necessitates this ford being made. At 23| miles the road is a rough narrow track closely overhanging the bank. The valley is 300 to 400 yards wide and the river winds from side to side of it. Several steep nari'ow valleys parallel to each other come in on the left bank. The ridges on either bank become higher and more rugged as the road ascends. At 24} miles the road is running up a narrow valley by a narrow track over lar’ge stones and round some jagged spurs from the hills to the N.-W. At 24} miles the river is skirted, flowing in a deep bed bordered by cliffs, lOO' high. In the valley there is splendid grass and a few patches of Indian corn are cultivated. At 25} miles the Gangir is forded for the third time. The ford is 30 yards wide and 2' deep, with a gravelly bottom and easily shelving banks. The track is stony and little used. At 254 miles the encamping ground on the river bank is reached. There are no villages to be seen in the neighbourhood. This is a camping ground for the Karind Turks in the summer.

The road leads 41} m. up the valley crossing several ravines and clay undulations covered with rich grass. At f mile the river is bordered by cliffs, 40' high of white chalky rock and conglomerate. At 1 mile the road descends steeply through an opening in the cliff into the river-bed. This avoids a spur which juts out from the right. The track in the river-bed is rough and obstructed by oleander bushes and reeds, along the foot of the cliffs. The valley is 300 yards wide, bordered by steep bare ridges 400 to OOO' high, the river flowing along the western side. A little cutting in theRoute No. Ylll{d)~contd. soft shale of the hillside would enable the road to be carried round the spur. At miles the road ascends a small gravelly ravine out of the river-bed and reaches a grassy terrace which borders it, and then runs round the foot of several spurs, the extremities of the range forming the Tulvar-i-Khuda range, a series of rocky impassable ridges running parallel to each other, and rising 2,000 to 3,000' above the valley. At 2.[ miles the river is running in a deep bed 40 to 50 yards wide bordered by gravelly cliffs, 80' high; the valley is 200 to 300 yards wide and is formed of a series of flat grassy terraces at the foot of the hills on either bank. The road keeps along the terrace on the left bank. The rock is a hard grey lime stone. At miles the road runs round the foot of a steep rocky spur which abuts here on the stream. This is the extremity of the highest ridge of the Tuivar-i-Khuda. The track is stony but easy. At 3J- miles are the ruins of a bridge called the Dukhtar-i-Kurd. A few wild figs are to be seen on the hillside, and good grass covers the slopes. At 4J miles the road runs through the Diz Giran valley, by a broad and easy track along the terrace running by the N. side of the valley underneath a rocky cliff, 100' high. The valley here is | of a mile broad, and the border hills are very rugged and steep. At 5 miles the valley is a J of a mile wide, and the road is good with a very gradual ascent. On the right bank are steep cliffs. At 6 miles the valley widens from one to one and a half miles, the river winding down the centre. It is six miles long running in an E.-K.-E. direc tion. On either side are low shaley spurs from the steep ranges further back, with numerous small valleys and streamlets which flow into the river. The upper portion of the valley is known as the Ziarat and the lower as the Diz Giran valley. At 7f miles an undulating valley is entered half a mile broad bounded on the S.-W. by one of the ridges of the Tulvar-i-Khuda range ; a few shrubs and fig trees are to be seen. At 7£ miles a steep rocky spur is passed, the prolongation of a ridge from the S.-E. which here juts across the valley and causes the river to make a sharp bend ; the end of the ridge forms a steep cliff overhanging the river-bed. The track ascends a side valley for a short distance and then turns up over the ridge following a steep ascent for 300 yards, by a series of short zigzags. At638 Route No. YIII{d)—contd. miles the road descends into the river valley and again reaches a wide grassy terrace overlooking the river-bed. A cutting in the soft shale round the extremity of the ridge would make this into a good cart road. At‘9| miles the hills on the left bank overhang the river, the strata forming nearly vertical sheets. ^ For 500 yards the track, a one to two foot ledge takes advantage of the broken parts of these strata. In places it has been helped by revetments of bushes and stones. The river is not fordable here or this bad portion might be avoided The rock is soft shale and a cutting could be made with little difficulty. At 10J miles the valley makes a bend to the N - E., and river forces its way through a gorge, known as the iang-i-bhutur-Gardan. The passage is only 30 to 40 yards wide bordered by steep limestone cliffs 150' high, at the bottom of which rushes a foaming torrent. The road is a broad track closely overlooking the cliff along the left bank. Ihe remains of an old bridge and some buildings, said to have been a Customs bar, are situated in the pass. The river gorge is f of a mile long and after that the valley again widens. At 11 4 miles the track descends by a series of easy zigzags into the river-bed, and the river is forded, for the fourth feme, by a ford 40 yards wide and 2' deep, over a rough rocky bed m a rapid stream; the approaches on either bank traokT .

The road follows a broad track up the centre of the valley inclining towards the N -E and gradually ascending. There are several small springs in the hillsides, and the water-supply is good and abundant. The border hills are of a white limestone. On the W. of the plain is a curious isolated hill called the Kaleh-i-Markara, the top of the hill being crowned by a cliff 60' high, and the ruins of an old fort. At If miles the road winds round the foot of a spur from the range to the E., here called the Bagh Kuh. The soil is a hard gravelly earth, with large stones and boulders ; the lower slopes are dotted with shrubs and stunted ilex and oaks. At 3 miles the road turns up through the Tang-i-Kushk, and ascends a gentle slope up a valley, in which the track is good with a few scattered stones. The Gilan Kuh is a steep rocky ridge bounding the valley to the N.-W. and lies immediately to the left. The pass is a deep gap between this and the Bagh Kuh, both ridges ending in terraced bluffs overlooking the road. At the foot of the pass, at 3f miles, the gradient is 5°, and the valley is 60 to 80 yards broad with a small stream. There is now a gradual ascent up the valley bordered in places by cliffs 30 to 40' high. The road is stony but fairly easy going, winding among the trees and boulders. At 4f miles a craggy cliff, 400' high, overhangs the road 200 yards to the left; this is end of the the Gilan Kuh. At 4f miles there is a short ascent for 30 yards by a series of short zigzags over loose stones and between trees. This continues to the summit of the pass. The ascent is gradual the whole of the way, and if the track was cleared of some of the boulders and the gradient lessened for some of the way near the summit by zigzags, a good cart road could be made. It is passable for artillery in its present condition. At 5 miles the summit of the pass is reached at an elevation of 1,875' above the Cham-i-Surkh plain. Immediately below to the N.-E. lies a deep narrow valley running downRoute No. VIII(VZ) — contd. towards the Gangir. The road from the summit keeps along that side of this valley and is rough and narrow ; in places is only an 8' to a 5' ledge. The soil is rich clay covered with grass. To the left is the Gilan Kuh ending ip a series of terraced bluffs. Several ravines run towards the valley to the right, and the opposite slope is thickly wooded, with some steep limestone cliffs near the summit. At 7 miles the route lies down a series of sharp zigzags over loose jagged stones fallen from the cliffs above. The dry bed of a stream in the valley is reached after about 200 yards of difficult going. At miles the road takes a sharp bend through the lower pass, also known as the Tang-i-Kushk. The pass is a rift in the mountain range, from 30 to 40 yards wide, the total length being 1,300 yards, bordered by precipitous cliffs of grey limestone, the strata of which run nearly horizontally. The road is rough and stony, but some parts have been im proved by laying down branches with earth and stones on top, but in the spring a torrent sweeps down the centre. It is level throughout and for the last 300 yards the track lies in the dry bed of the torrent. There are several caves at the northern mouth of the pass. At 74 miles the road opens out into a narrow valley with steep stony sides on either hand. At 8 miles the road emerges into the Mindar valley, running N.-W. in the direction of Gilan, and S,-E« in the direction of Zarneh. It is here miles wide and gently sloping up from the centre in a series of rounded grassy ridges dotted with fine trees like an English park. The road bifurcates here, one branch running down to Gilan and Qasr-i-Shirin. At 9f miles the road is a broad track over light gravelly soil. At 10| miles the summit of a ^ on g gradual ascent is reached. This ridge forms the watershed of the Gilan and /j&amp;rneh valleys. At 11 miles the road passes several ruins and scattered stones marking the site of a place called Karan. The trees gradually disappear as the descent is made and the Zarneh plain itself is quite bare. At 20i miles the camping ground near the ruins of old Zarneh is reached. Supplies may be procurable from nomads. 4 GIIAH MlnA C AMP .. I3J m. General direction N.- E.

At 4f miles S rums of the vdlage of Zarneh are passed on a Jge tumulus n the plain, a few of the houses still being standing, but mostly in rums. The country is deserted except by the Kalhiir Kurd nomads who come here in*the summer months and retire to the plains of Zuhab for the winter. The tnmulus on which Zarneh stands is 200 yards in diameter, and rises 100' out of the plain Just N. of it lies a large spring called toe Chashmeh-i-Zarneh from whieh a large stream of excellent water issues. The plain grows good grass. The nomads send men, directly the snow is off the ground, to sow patches of Indian corn which they reap when they arrive later on.- I\umerous other smaller springs are passed and water is abund ant at all times of the year. At the southern end of the nlain is Manisht Kuh. At 5f miles Zarneh plain is left and the road turns up through a pass in the ridge bordering it on the E The pass is 30 to 40' wide bordered by steep grassy slopes dotted with a few trees and topped by steep rugged cliffs The track is level, but the going is rough owing to loose stones which might easily be cleared away. At 164 miles the pass widens to 200 yards but the going is still rough over loose stones; the cliffs to the left are 400' high • the road follows the dry bed of a stream. -At 7£ miles the’pass again narrows to 90 yards with steep slopes on either hand where tne track is nearly level and the going less stony At 8 miles the valley opens out into a small grassy basin 200 yards broad, in which there are a few stunted trees. At 8J miles the road emerges into a small grassy valley a 4 of a mile broad bordered on the N. by a steep ridge called the Gumlr Kuh, impassable on this side because of sheets of vertical limetone strata. The valley runs up 2 miles in aN.-W. direc tion and is well wooded. C70GSB 2 pRoute No. Vlll{d)—wntd. The road leads diagonally across the valley. To the S. lie the undulating table land and hills of Asimabad, or Asinan- abad, where are the extensive ruins of an ancient city. A long gradual slope rises from here to the flat summit of Manisht Kuh. At 10 miles, the head of the valley is reached, and the road turns E. up a stony rough ascent for 400 yards through trees. The track is much obstructed bv large‘ stones A 4 of a mile further on the track is rough, skirting a small craggy ravine to the right. This rough ascent could be made easier by carrying the road a wider sweep to the S. and bridging the ravine or filling it in. At lOf miles there is a sharp ascent by a series of zig-zags in the craggy hillsides for 2 -0 yards, and the track is much obstructed by over hanging trees which catch in the mule loads. At 114 miles the summit of the col is reached and the road proceeds along the ridge by a broad track.

A side-valley bounded by rounded hills stretches away to the left for about a mile. All this ridge is fertile soil growing rich grass, but without a single inhabitant. The numerous ruins passed testify to former prosperity. The road now enters a craggy valley bor dered by cliffs of grey limestone down which runs the Karind river, or the Ab-i-Karind.

Prom this latter pass down the Jalalvand valley there is a continuous descent, the first £ mile of which is very steep, but afterwards a steady gradual decline. The pathway from the Tang-i- Khartibeg to the can.ping ground on the Ab-i-Yazman is good and clear and not stony. Mules did the journey without much difficulty, only two falling in the passes. There are about 200 huts in the vicinity of the camping ground. The Ab-i-Yazman is about 50' broad at the camping ground, and had only 1 ' of water in August: stony bed. Water. —None till the Ab-i-Yazman is met. PweZ.—Obtainable. Supplies. Crops of rice, wheat, barley, dhal (mung) and Indian corn in Jalalvand.652 Route No. VIII (f )—contd. 4 HULAILAN 61 hre. A track the whole way suitable for pack transport only. The first 2 or 3 miles the road is very narrow and greatly cut up by irrigation cuts. After coming out of the Jalalvand valley it passes over easy undulating ground, and is a good open track but owing to constant nalas it is rendered impassable for wheeled transport In the first 2 m. the Ab-i-Yazrman has to be ° ross d S P *t the first point the bed of the river is about 100 yards across’, the stream 15 yards ; at the second P^t thn stream is about 20 yards across, and has more force °f water. At the first place of crossing there is T of water and at the second nearly 2' At both places the bed of the river is very stony ; nevertheless it forms no serious obstacle. After entering the plain of Hulailan the road is a broad, clear, and level track as far as SeRiver Saidmarreh Kara Su. This river has to be crossed iust before reaching Imamzadeh-i-Shah Muhammad. At the time of crossing the water was up to, and over, the animals bellies, the streL being about 30 to 40 yards aeross. A fairly swift-running river, stony bottom, low banks. Rilleh Kan is the name given to the boundary between the Jalalvand and Hulailan countries. There is no mark to identify it.

For the 3 m. 5 5 TARHAIN .. pp to the Tang-i-Mi- , vajan (5,500 / ), the pathway is difficult, being a steady climb the whole way, at times almost impassable. From this pass almost as far as the Tang-i-Kalan Daran (6,000') the road is a good open track and passable for all transport; ground slightly undulating. There are a few deserted huts, where water has run out. The 1 ang- - Kalan Daran itself appears impassable for transport, but cara vans go across without any mishap. This pass would require good deal of blasting and preparation to make it of practical use. From this pass, the point marked 5,150 on map, there is a track on a steady decline, only fit for mules and don keys. From this point to Tarhan the track broadens and is good tor all transport.

Epitome. General .—An alternative route, the more direct one to Buru- jird being through Kai avand [Lateral Route No. IN (e), 63 m. in 4 stages]. The latter, however, runs immediately below tie lofty mountains of Luristan, and caravans become an easy prey to predatory Lurs, who are able to regain their fastnesses without fear of interference. The road, as far as Hamilabad (2nd stage), is a good track* well bridged and suitable for carriages. In its later stages labour would be required to be expended in widening the track and improving the gradients to make it fit for carriages. Supplies —Available on the spot, at the intermediate stages limited, and they should not be counted on to suffice for more than 200 men and 500 animals for one day, except at Ushta^rinan, where double that number could be supplied. At Kangavar supplies would be available for a brigade with transport ; while Burujird could doubtless sustain a division for a certain period at least. It may be noted that the road passes through one of the most fertile regions in Persia ; and large quantities of wheat, barley, rice and other food stubs, besides live-stock, could be collected in their season. Water —Is abundant for all practical purposes and of excel lent quality. Transport .—Probable number of mules available on the spot at Burujird 1,000 ; and within two months a total of 3,000 or 4,000 might be collected from Luristan, if communications with that province be open. Another 250 mules would be found amongst the other stages, including Kangavar.Route No. VIII (i) — contd.

Sawyer (winter 1890) makes Kangavar to Parasiab 21 m. and says the Bagrabad /eutal could be avoided by a detour, and Parasiab reached on an almost level line at about 5,120'. In building a railway or cart road, it would hardly be worth while to avoid the hital, which could be easily cut through or reached at low inclines by huggihg the mud hillocks to the N.; Parasiab would seem to be an obligatbry point, as from it exists the best line to reach the central plateau. 2 HAMlLABAl&gt; .. 10 to.

Sultanabad is the chief town, where a Hakim (a sub-governor) resides. This town is plainly visible from Ahingaran, bearing 160°, and only 18 m. off. The country is said to be all under cultivation, and the numerous qandts certainly bear evidence of the fact. The district of Faharan is bounded on the N. by a low range of mudBoute No. VIII (/)— contd . hills, two peaks of which, 30 m. distance, are conspicuous ; the conical one (not the highest) is called Kuh-i-Tafrish, and is a good landmark.

Epitome, General direction TST. With certain provisos as under, the road is passable for Ford vans, Army Transport carts, and field guns throughout from Hamadan to Zinjan, provided that the alternative route via Sultanleh is taken. From Bulamaji to Zinjan the road is passable for pack animals only. In wet weather the surface is very soft and muddy in a few places, especially between Ak Tappeh (stage 3, mile 5) and Jurmach (stage 3, mile 20). There is also a swampy valley at mile 9|, stage 7, which would be impassable in wet weather. Ford vans—The road would be passable for Ford vans as far as Bulamaji (stage 7, mile 20), if they carried picks and shovels and also some planks and boards nailed together to help them over difficult culverts. L. A, M. cars .—In dry weather with the same bridging material as for Ford cars, L. A. M. cars could reach Kujur (stage 5, mile 19). Beyond this point the gradients are too steep. In wet weather, with bridging material, L. A. M. cars could reach Damakh (stage 4, mile 5) with difficulty. Field guns .—Field guns could reach Bulamaji (stage 7, mile 20 ), but bridging material would be required.

At mile 71 the Kara Chai is spanned by a stone and burnt brick bridge tit for all arms up to armoured cars and motor lorries. It consists of 3 bays, one span being 18 / and two spans 12' each. The piers are 12' thick. This bridge is 27 yards long and 5 yards wide; it is cracked but capable of carrying up to 10 tons. The Kara Chai (shingle bottom) is dry in summer and contains only a little water in winter. Should the bridge be broken, the Kara Chai could be easilv made fordable for motors at all times with a little spade-work. At mile 11 is a tea house. Here the route leaves the main Hamadan-Kazvin road and runs almost due N. From this point the road is un metalled and liable to become very muddy in wet weather. Along the road there is good grazing and also good camping ground, but the usual scarcity of fuel. Latga lies i mile W. of the village of Ak Bulaq. 'The population of Latga is 2,000.

At mile 5J the road crosses a 7 -arched bridge over the Mazdaran river. The water is shallow (9th May 1918) and the bed muddy, and the banks sloping and low. The bridge, which is built of brick and mortar with a stone foundation, is 80 yards long, 15' wide, and 20' high. It is capable of carrying all arms. The river, when in flood, is liable to swamp the road for about 500 yards on each side of the bridge. At mile 9 is the large village of Mahajaran (population 4,000). The streets are in an exe crable state of repair, but straight, except for one bad left-handed turn near the entrance. In the middle of the village an irrigation canal is crossed by means of a stone culvert. Fuel is obtainable from willows and orchards. Stone, rafters, and doors are available in the village. The road from here to Kabutrahang (mile 22) has a good surface of fine gravel. Grazing is good for horses and camels. At mile 12J there is a canal 6 ' wide with steep banks and muddy bed.

A herd of about 200 head of cattle and also numerous donkeys were seen here (9th May 1918). Grazing is good and plentiful. The road continues W.-N.-W. and winds through cultivation (rice fields) until Kella is reached at mile 6 . Kella is a small village of 600 inhabitants. Water is good and plentiful, but there are no supplies and fuel is scarce. From mile 64 to mile 74 the road leads down a narrow dry watercourse, after which the going becomes very good, the surface of the road being of gravel. At mile 8 is the small village of Bizin (population 300). The road passes on the E. side of the village. Then there is a very steep climb for 50 yards of about 1 in 5, followed by a sharp turn to the W. on reaching the top. From here the road runs on a bear ing of 340° towards the W. end of a range of low-lying mountains. The going is good. There are many small hills to climb until Mahmud Khalach is reached at mile 15.

The surface of the road was very muddy owing to rain ( 9 th May 1918), At mile 10 the village of Sazun (20 houses) lies mileRoute No. VIII ( m )— contd . E. of the road. At mile 10J a ravine is crossed by a newly made culvert of stone ramps bridged by 10' poles, t There are slopes of 1 in 5 on each side at different angles. BetAveen n ile lO^ and mile 11 are many culverts and gradients of 1 in 10 . From mile 11 to mile 17 the going is good over a hard surface and downhill most of the way. Hissar (mile 17) is a large village (population 750). There are many fruit trees and much cultivation along the river banks. Water .—Good and unlimited. Supplies.—Xi\ (9th May 1918), but a good harvest would make some supplies available consisting of vegetables, rice, tea, sugar, and onions as in stage 2 . Fuel .—Plentiful as in stage 1. A road fit for pack animals only goes from Hissar to Bijar. Distance 44 miles. Water good, except between mile 12 and mile 24.

The road is undulating throughout this stage and is passable for all arms. The road passes round the foot of the Paighambar Dagh, nearly all the country being under cultiva tion. At mile 5 is the small village of Ghaidar with 100 houses. There are two good springs and grazing on the N. side of the village. Supplies are scarce. On leaving Ghaidar the road is broad and good. At mile 7! it passes a small Anllage. Zivar, | mile W. of the road. At mile 9! is a marshy valley. The road is slightly raised aboA-e the surface of the marsh for 50 yards. In wet weather this valley Avould be impassable. At mile 10 is the village of Mazidabad (60 houses) situated in a large hollow. In the village there are two narroAV culverts which would be difficult places for L. A. M. cars, and also a banked up portion of the road. With two days’ labour, av th wood from the villages, these places could be made passable for L. A. M. cars. There is good Avater from the river and from one spring, sufficient for one brigade. Wheat and lucerne are obtainable. There is also some grazing.

Ihe road is difficult m places even for pack animals as the track leads beside the stream on a steep ledge which is being eaten away by water trickling down the hill. At mile 3 the road^ passes on the W. of Chinguru 120 houses). Water can be obtained from a mountain stream and one spring. There are some ymes; also wheat, lucerne and grazing. From mile 3 to mile 4|r the road leads uphill, crossing several small stream beds, there being several steep gradients of 1 in 20. At mile 44 the road reaches the top of the pass. The chain of hills stretching E. and W. forms a well-defined watershed. From mfie 44 the road descends passing along a difficult ravine with a mountain torrent (mile 6 f). At mile 7 the road leads round the W. of the village Khm-ram Darreh (40 houses) and at mile 10 passes the684 Route No. VIII (m)—contd. village of Kurdanoh (20 houses). Here are willow and poplar trees. There is sufficient water supply for one regiment. At mile 14 the road passes through a narrow defile with a stony surface where it would be difficult to dig out a passage for cars. Rahmin or Rahmlnabad (mile 15|) is a small village of 50 houses. There are no supplies. There is a good water-supply for 1 brigade. At mile 17| is a narrow defile similar to that at mile 14. &amp; There are several difficult gradients at stream beds. At mile 18 is a deserted coffee-house near a stream, with a camp ing ground on the E. side of the road with good grazing and good stream water. At mile 20 the road reaches the crest line of the hills S. of Zinjan. From here there is a commanding, view of Zinjan, 24 miles away. There is a steep winding descent over a stony surface into the town. At the entrance to the town the road crosses a three-arched bridge over the Zinjan Rud. The bridge is 50 yards long, 8 yards broad, and is built of brick, the roadAvay being paved with large stones. The centre arch is 40 high, i3 yards long, and 9 yards broad. The other two arches are 35 / high and of the same length and breadth as the centre arch. The piers jut out 3 yards broader than the bridge on either side. Each pier has two arches, one above the other. The river in places is 40’ wide and 2' deep. At present it is fordable (29—31st May 1918). The bed is stony. The river is spanned by an exactly similar bridge 1 mile W. of the above, carrying a road to Bijar (passable for wheels with difficulty).

General direction N.-N.-E. to Sultanieh ; then N.-W. along the main Ka vin-Ziujan road. This road is reported asRoute No. VIII {m) — concld. practicable for cars. It is not worse than the road between Damakh and Hissar and is in most places better. One pass is crossed named the Khuarak Pass between Hissar and Sultani- eh. The pass has a steep descent and loaded vehicles need assistance. / This alternative route leaves the direct road at Mazidabad (stage 7, mile 10) and passes through Gavandarak, Nazarquli (here the road crosses the small Gahrud river), and Khuarak. Shubant is two miles W. of the road. ROUTE NO. VIII (w). From KAZVlN to QUM via SAVEH. This is the most direct route from Kazvin to Isfahan and was formerly much used for transport of merchandise to and from Russia. Since the cessation of Russian trade the Kazvin-Saveh section has been little frequented. In the autumn of 1915 the Russians used motor transport between Kazvin and Lalehkhan, the fourth stage, where they established a post. ' Saveh-Qam section is used by the Persian postal carts from Tehran to Qum. From Kazvin to Ismatabad, mile 30, was traversed by Major Edmonds, Political Officer, Kazvin, in April 1920 and he report ed on it as probably passable for all arms in summer and autumn, for infantry, cavalry and light carts in winter and spring except after rain/ At about mile 8 , a short distance beyond Mashaldar, it enters kavlr or salt plains and after rain is liable to become boggy and treacherous, but Ford vans can pass over it during the dry season if planks and spades are carried. The Rud-i-Shur, about mile 14, with 2 or 3 branches and other inner cuts, is crossed by timber and brushwood bridges. The principal obstacle, the Kharrud at about mile 20, is spanned'by a brick bridge in good repair. _ Beyond Ismatabad, where the road enters the hills, it is reported to be better going and the gradients easy. —*686 Route No. VIII (w) — contd.

From Kazvln this road goes up into the hills along the narrow valley above the reservoir. It is stony in parts, but the ascent is gradual except for the last mile up to Zirishk, which is situated on a plateau on the W. of the valley. Beyond the village the road rises over open country to the Zirishk ridge at about 1,500'. Just N. of the ridge it forks. The left hand branch via Falar (70 houses), 8 m. from Zirishk, leads down to Dehdusbab, pole bridge over the Shahrud, 11 m., and goes up the right bank to Shahristan, 15 m. This is a detour necessitated when the Shahrud is in flood. The direct road descends a valley to Sapuhin, keeps along the hillside and crosses a low ildge to the W. out of the valley, and descends to Fanfin.688 Route No. VIII (o) — contd.

The ridges crossed are comparatively low-- under 8 000—and they are usually not blocked by snow for more than a few^days. The route crosses the hills JST. of Kazvin by the Kamasar pass, about 7,500', and descends to the Shahrud at Anbu bridge at about 2,500', climbs over the undulating Turar ridge to the Chakarud valley (a branch of the Pul-i Rud) between 4,000' and 5,000', whence it crosses the Latakuh ridge at about 7,500' and makes a steep descent to the Shalman ravine which it follows to the Gilan plain past Amlish to the Langarud-Rudisar road. The gradients are mostly easy over undulating hills and the surface much better than the average and freer from stones. The descent from Latakuh to the Shalman ravine in stage 5 is the worst section. 6 The country is hilly but comparatively open except down the torest-ciad Shalman ravine N. of Latakuh. The highlands of an average height from 6,000' to 7,000' within the triangle Rahmatabad-Dailiman-AmaiTu are undulating, open and not wooded. They admit of free movement and many paths connect the different villages. They are, however, difficult of access from without and steep forest-clad approaches lead up to them from the lowlands, from the Safid Rud on the W. via the SiahRud ravine to Damash or Dailiman, from the Gilan plain on the N. via the Shimarud ravine, or via Amlish and the Shalman ravine, and on the S .they end in a scarp above the Shahrud valley. Sv/pplips.—In stages 1 to 3 supplies are average. Umam, stage 4, is in the fertile Dailiman area and supplies for 1,000 men and 600 animals could be collected at 3 days’ notice except in May and June before the harvest. A force of 500 men and 300 animals could probably be maintained locally for some weeks except before the harvest, when 100 men and 50 animals would be the maximum which could live on the country.

From m. 18 the track descends easily to Damash (30 houses) on a small plateau at the source of the Siah Rud, the summer residence’of the chiefs of Amarlu, and deserted in winter. Supplies for 20 men but no barley are obtainable. Water scarce en route, but excellent from big springs at Damash. 3 KILISHUMor .. 10 m. From Damash a DAILIMAN. track leads S.-E. to 40 m . Kilishum and another leads N.-E. via Asiabar (100 houses) to Dailiman. Both are good and about the same distance. Communications.—OthQY tracks from Damash are— (a) W. down to Siah Bud valley through Rahmatatad district to Tutkabun on the Safid Rud opposite to Rustamabad, about 25 m. A difficult track through forest. (b) S. to Jarindeh 8 m. along a good track. Steep ascent of about 1 m. to the ridge above Damash and then a steady gradual descent all the way to Jarindeh.699 ROUTE NO. VIII (s). From MANJIL to the HARAZ Valley (Main Route No. I, Stage 6), via SHAHRUD and NTJR Valleys. Distance miles. 14 stages. Epitome. This lateral route from W. to E. through the Elburz is not a trade route, but sections of it are used by a fair number of local chdrvdddrs (muleteers) and it is crossed by all the trans- Elburz routes from the plateau to the Caspian. Owing to the fDrmation of lateral valleys within the Elburz, which run parallel to the main ridges in an easterly and westerly direction until they turn N. and break through to the Caspian, this traverse through the heart of the mountain system does not entail so much switchback work as might be anticipated. The lateral valleys are in parts narrow and rocky, but have a dry climate and are free from jungle, as the ridge separating them from, the Caspian intercepts the moisture. N. of this ridge spurs run down from it between river gorges, and although sinuous they keep a fairly regular general direction from S. to N., the ridge resembling the spine and these offshoots the ribs. They are extremely precipitous and below 8,000' or 7,000' are clothed with forest, which increases in density as lower levels are reached, and constitute a most difficult forest and mountain region. The mule routes follow the ravines N. and S. and lateral com munication between them is practically impossible except in the lowlands near the Caspian coast —vide Minor Route No. 2. Forces based on the plateau towns of Kazvin and Tehran and holding the ridges against an enemy advancing up these ravines from the N. consequently have a fairly easy lateral line of communication on their rear—an advantage which is denied to their opponents. In the summer of 1920 Gendarmerie and Cossack detachments, posted to look out for Jangali-Bolshevik raiding parties, kept in touch with each other by this means. The route may be divided into 3 sections. Section J.—Manjil to Talaghan via Shahrud valley.700 Route No. VIII (s)— contd. Section 2.—Talaghan valley to Nur valley via Asalak ridge to Laura (upper Karaj valley) via Kandavan ridge. Lateral Route No. I (n), to Duna, via Turk'ubashm ridge to Lamar bun, via Balangibu ridge to the headwaters of the Nur. This section between the Shahrud and Nur river systems entails considerable climbing and in winter the ridges are mocked by snow. Section 3 .—Nur valley. Section 1 .— Stage 8 .. Garab Stages 1 to 3 are described in Lateral Route No. V ITT (r). The road goes along the slopes N. of the Shahrud, which between Fftrudbar and Anbu bridge flows through a gorge reported to be passable for pack animals with great difficulty. For Anbu bridge, see Lateral Route No. VIII (p), Kazvin to Langarud .—It is a solid one arch brick bridge 60' above the water in the centre, 50' span and 15' roadway. The top is considerably worn and the approaches on both sides are bad. Stages 4 and 5—the track follows the valley. There is a pole bridge at Dehdushab in stage 5, 12 m. above Anbu, 4 m. below Shahristan, crossed by Lateral Route No. \ III (p), Kazvin to Ru- disar, when the Shahrud is in flood and the Fanfin-Shahristan ford impassable. There is a pole bridge at Siahdasht (1 m. from. Hasanabad,) stage 5, 10 m. above Dehdushab. See Lateral Route No. VI (6), Kazvin to Shahsavar, Alternative Route 1. There are several villages in these stages mostly up side- valleys, especially that of the Nairn Rud, N. of Shahristan, and Stage 1 Stage 2 .. Jarindeh Route No. VIII (r) Stage T .. Kilishum..

(See Lateral Route No. VI (b), Kazvm to Shahsavar, Alternative Route 1.) In stage 6. above Hasanabad the valley -contracts to | m. in width between cliffs. The path goes up the stony water course which fills the whole valley, but when the Shahriid is in flood this becomes impassable, and a path along the hills must be taken from Slahdasht bridge, which descends at Shlreh Kuh, 6 m. up the valley from Slahdasht and just above the junc tion of the Alamut and Talaghan streams, which together form the Shahrud. The Shahrud becomes a wide turbid torrent from February to June. In some places, where it is split up into several channels, it is fordable with difficulty except during the height of the flood in April and May, when it can only be crossed by the Lcshan, Pariidbar, Anbu, Dehdushab and Siahdasht bridges. There are no boats. In July as soon as the snow has thawed off the high ranges it rapidly dwindles and in November is only about 35' wide and H' deep. The Talaghan stream is crossed by a pole bridge at Shireh Kuh. /See Lateral Route No. \ I (b). Alternative Route 2. Further progress along the Talaghan valley is barred by a gorge, and the track goes up into the hills above the left bank and comes down at Kalarud (25 houses), stage 6, just above the top end of the gorge. Stages 5 and 8 are village-to-village tracks and the least used of this route. In stage 7 the track follows the river past Ushan on the -opposite (right) bank, crosses a pole bridge, where the river comes out of a defile, and climbs steeply about f m. up to Mir (250 houses), the largest village in Talaghan and residence of local landowners and merchants. It is situated on a steep hill above the river. From this the road descends gradually through vineyards to the river, and then passes through a ravine for 2 m. It is built along the cliff and the surface is rocky. Above the ravine in the district of Talaghan the valley becomes more open and villages are numerous but poor. An alternative route from Hasanabad, stage 5, to Shahrak, stage 7, is via Mu’allim Kalaieh to Shahrak in Alarniit, and thence across the watershed between Alamut and Talaghan to Shahrak (in Talaghan),702 Route No. YIII (s)— n oncld. See Lateral Route No. VT (b), Kazvlnto Shahsavar, Communica tions and Alternative Route 1. This route is easier, especially when the rivers are unfordable, and supplies are plentiful. From Shahrah the road keeps up the valley past Joistan [see Lateral Route No. 2 (a), Joistan to Sardabrud via Kalardasht] to Garab (20 houses), stage 8, the last village in the valley. The Talaghan river, at any rate below Joistan, is unfordable from March to May, but it is narrow and crossed by pole bridges near all the principal villages. Many tracks from villages in the Kazvin-Tehran plain cross the hills to the Shahrud and Talaghan valleys. For some of the principal of them see Lateral Route No. VI (b), Kazvin to Shahsavar, Appendix A. Section 2 .— Stage 9 .. Azadbar .. .. ' Laura, Kuj ur and Stage 10 .. Duna .. .. ) N ur Districts.

Nisind or Valameh Beyond Garab the track ascends the valley and rises gra dually to the Asalak ridge, about 9,400', whence it makes an easy descent of 1,000' in 6 m. to Azadbar (60 houses) in an open valley. The gradients are easy and surface good. No villages are passed en route, but water is plentiful and there are several shepherds’ camps in summer. From Azadbar the track goes a short- distance through open cultivated land and then makes a steep ascent up the mountain N. of the stream and runs along the slopes above it, as far as the junction of the Azadbar stream with the Laura river from Gachisar, when it drops down several hundred feet to Shahpul bridge and meets Lateral Route No. I (n) in stage 3 (q.v.). The distance from Azadbar to Shahpul is 6 m. Road good. The valley is narrow and steep and contains no villages. From Shahpul follow Lateral Route No. I (n) past Gachisar—the stage can be conveniently divided into 2 by halting here—and over the Kandavan ridge to its bifurcation, 9 m. from Gachisar. Thence take the N.-E. branch to Duna, about 4 m. distant. From Duna the road is a switchback over the Turkubashm ridge to Kamarbun, and then over Balangibu ridge to NisindRoute No. VIII ( 5 )— concld. at the top of the iSTur valley, where Lateral Route No. I (m) crosses it. The distance from Kamarbun to Nisind is said to be 6 m. From Kamarbun another route crosses the Malakchashmeh ridge to Zanus and meets Lateral Route No. I (m) below Mlkhsaz, These passes remain open in autumn for some weeks longer than Siitak o'n Lateral Route No. I (m), After Sutak is closed, charvd- ddrs (muleteers) of Pul and Nur travel by this route to Tehran until they are finally snowed up for the winter. Supplies .—The Talaghan and Laura villages are poor and a force stationed in these valleys would require to fetch supplies from Kalardasht or via Tehran. The Luna valley contains 3 or 4 prosperous villages. Sheep are plentiful, especially at Azadbar, which has fine grazing from June to August, and flocks come up from Sauj Bulaq and surrounding districts. Stage 12. Baladeh ] Stage 13. Takor Stage 14.

T. carts and held guns in the dry season only, as there are two large rivers to be forded which are liable to be impassable from November to May, both inclusive. From Bijar to the ford at stage 1, mile 14, the road is 10 wide, thence it becomes a 12' road built by the Russians in 1916, but it re quires repairing in places (details later). In wet weather tne surface becomes soft and heavy with the exception of the last 25 miles where the road is fairly hard. Ramps require stone revet ments, as they are liable to crumble away, and, as at present, they require frequent attention. Small streams constantly carry down stones and block the road. Irrigation cuts are continually being opened up across the road. All ascents zigzag for easy gradients. Local labour is scarce. Stone for repairs is to hand in most places and is everywhere within reasonable carriage distance. Water. —Water is plentiful along the road with the exception of the 5 miles of plateau between Saidan (stage 1, mile 6J-) and Khurkhureh (stage 1,. mile 11|), between Zerrinalad (stage 5, mile 1!) and Koseler (stage 5, mile 8) and between Ajdahati (stage 6, mile 7|) and Zinjan (stage 6, mile Hi).

It is unbridged This is the most difficult stage in the whole route Immediately after leaving Bijar a track fit for pack animals branches off to the N. This should be avoided and the track leading to the right (i.e., N.-E.) followed. It leads across a valley with a stream of good water which is fordable at all seasons. At 1J mile the village of Takht is passed, situated to the W. of the road. From here the road leads Over a bare plateau to mile 4r\, where it drops into a shallow valley till mile 0 i w h e re the village of Saida is reached. These last two miles could be much improved for wheeled traffic without much labour. Water is good and plentiful at Saida. At mile 7 is a ravine, 40' deep &amp; with bad approaches, passable for the above men tioned arms and transport, but it requires further ramping and culverting to make it satisfactory. From this point the road leads over waterless undulating country till Khurkhureh village is reached at mile 11| on the E. of the road. At mile 12 a deep ravine which Would be improved by further ramping is reached and a deep and well ramped nald is crossed at mile 13. At mile 14 the road leads down steeply for 30' to the Kizil Uzun river, where (September 1918) there was a ford 20 yards wide with 2' of water. (In October 1918 it was 10 yards wide and l!'deep). The bed of the river is 180 yards in width. The road rises 20 feet from the river bed. Both banks require ex tensive ramping. On leaving the river bank the road again rises steeply, crossing an irrigation channel 8 ' wide^ and 2' deep which requires culverting. Bianu, a small village of 10 houses on the E. of the road, is passed at mile 14J. The road becomes excellent to mile 16, but at this point it had become obliterated for £ mile by cultivation, but is now passable (October 1918). The road leads down to the river bed which it follows for \ mile and then crosses to the opposite bank and up a gentle rise to Tutaghach at mile 17|.

The road is well engineered •and leads up a valley to mile 2J, then runs across the fiat to mile 4 J where it zigzags down a steep descent. (For infantry and pack transport there is a short cut Straight down the hillside.) From the foot of the hill the road passes over undulating country to Bairat Qishlaq at mile 6J, thence over a bare plateau to mile gl w hich would be marshy after rain. The road, which is well engineered, crosses a succession of ridges to Saksan, a village of about 100 houses mostly in ruins at mile 10J. Here a small stream with a shallow stony bottom is forded (20 yards wide in August 1918 and 10 yards wide and 1' deep in October 1918). One and quarter miles to the E. is Moghanlu, a village of about 100 houses, many of which are in ruins. Water. —plentiful. (October 1918.)

From Khandur to mile 6 the road ascends a hill, crossing a culvert, mile 5, which needs rebuilding. Be tween mile 61 and mile four culverts have been washed away and a car would be delayed for an hour or so digging ramps down to and out of the nalds. The road descends and winds down the narrow valley and then bends sharply to the S.-E. to the Kizil TJzun river which is crossed at mile 7 by means of a bridge of four arches fit for field guns. The arches are 30', 51', 66' and 51' wide, respectively. The bridge is built of brick on stone piers. A ramp leads up to the roadway at each720 Boute No. X (6)— contd. end, the road being 18' wide and 270' long. The gra dient is easy except for a stretch on to the bridge at the S.-W. end. The road then turns N’.*W. to mile 7J. Yangikand, a small village of 100 houses with an old fort in the centre, is passed at mile 10|. On leaving Yangikand an irrigation channel, which needs culverting, is crossed. The road then crosses a stream by means of a ford 15 yards wide and 2' deep (October 1918), Detours have to be made round two broken culverts at mile 11 and mile 11^. Just before reaching Tazehkand (W. the valley is wide and about 1,000 acres of wheat were under cul tivation in September 1918. Tazehkand (W.) is reached at mile 14|. From Tazehkand (W.) there is an alternative route to Khain (N.), stage 4, mile 13.

Detour had to be made round them (September 1918). At mile 3 there is a partially destroyed culvert, but it is still passable. Ankevin (a small village 1 mile away across the river) is passed at mile 4. At this point the road leaves the river. At mile 4| and mile 5 are two destroyed cul verts. They require rebuilding. A good deal of work was necessary (September 1918) before these streams could be crossed by a detour. The road ascends steeply to mile 7 on to a bare plateau 1| miles across, to the W. of which is the village of Kiziljak, deep in a ravine. From the N. edge of the plateau a track drops steeply down to the river. The motor road is wellRotue No* X (6)— zontd. engineered and zigzags down the slope. The river is erossed by a ford which only contained a few inches of water (September 1918). One mile further on a considerable stream which runs down from Hedt, 3 miles to the N., is crossed by a ford 10 yards wide and 2' deep (September 1918). The road continues over numerous irrigation cuts forT| miles. These streams were troublesome (September 1918), but were crossed by filling in with large stones which allow passage of the water. A plateau is then crossed. At mile 12| the alternative route through Khain (South) rejoins the main road. Khain (North) is reached at mile 13. Water .—Plentiful (August 1918).

Sakiz is about 5,100' above sea- level. Population .—At present about 10,000 in about 3,000 houses. Before the war the population was about 20,000, practically all Kurds. There are 300 to 400 Jews, but no Christians. The population of the town and the villages In the vicinity is of Sakizi Kurds.

This is a summer track for local use by Alamutls and 1 alaghanis fetching grain from Kalardasht, and not a through trade route from the plateau to the Caspian. After the har vest 30 to 40 mules in each direction pass over it daily. It crosses the Hasarchal ridge, the watershed between the T.alaghan and Sardabrud streams, at an elevation of over 11,500', probably the highest point in the Elburz crossed by a mule track, and is closed by snow from November to June. Irom Joistan it goes up a valley by Parechan, stage 1, climbs out of the valley and over some open country to the foot of the Hazar Cham (1,000 windings) of Tajaghan, by which it zigzags for 3,000' up to the Hasarchal ridge, close to the peaks of Takht-i-Sulaiman. N. of the ridge it drops 600' to the sources of the Sardabrud in the hollow of Hasarchal, and then follows the ravine past Khurramdasht teashop, stage 2, down to \ andarabun, 7,700', 10 m., where the Barjr ravine joins from the S.-W. The Sardabrud changes direction from N. to N.-E, and the valley becomes wooded. It continues narrow, winding and rocky to 18J m. and the track reaches Rudbarak (80 houses), the most southerly village of Kalardasht, at 20 m. and Hasan K f (70 houses), the residence of the chiefs of the Khwajavand tribe, at 22 m.

It is a pear-shaped basin with the stem to the E., about 7 m. long from E. to W. and 5 m. at its greatest breadth. It has a con siderable rainfall and also is irrigated throughout by theSar- dabrud and tributary brooks which traverse it from S.-W. to N.-E. . On leaving the Kalardasht plain at its N.-Eastern corner, the Sardabrud again enters a ravine from which it emerges on to the lowlands. Eor routes from Kalardasht to the Caspian see separate report. [Lateral Route No. 2(6).] Gradients.—The Hazar Cham of Talaghan is very steep and shortness of breath caused by the elevation makes the climb severe. Its surface is fair. Down the Sardabrud to Kalardasht the descent is steady and gradual and surface average. The worst gradients and surface are in stage 4 between Kalardasht and the lowlands. Supplies .—Several villages are passed in Talaghan, the largest of them being Dizan (100 houses) and Rarechan (80 houses), stage 1. The Sardabrud ravines from Hasarchal to Kalardasht, and again from Kalardasht to the lowlands contain no villages. To Khurramdasht teashop, stage 2, supplies must be brought from Kalardasht, stage 3, where 1,000 men and 600 animals could be supplied at 48 hours’ notice. Kalardasht should be able to main tain 1 300 men and 800 animals, reduced to 300 men and 200 animals before the harvest. Transport.—Charva ’ars met on this route are Talaghanis and Alamutls. In Kalardasht about 600 ponies (y&amp;bii) are used by peasantry for local work.

At 9 miles it descends to the river at 2,500', crosses a bridge, and keeps along the left bank to Ligani teashop (no village), 1,700', at 12 miles. This long march can be divided into 2 stages by halting here, but no supplies are available. At 14^ miles it fords the river, which is impassable in flood, crosses a low ridge and passes down through a cleft to a tributary, whence it makes a^steep ascent to a ridge at 2 400' at 164 miles. The surface from tne ford to the ridge is an abominable succession of rock and slough. From 2.400' it descends gradually to a side valley at 850' and rejoins the Sardabrud, which has flowed through a gorge, at 214 miles near Zuvad (10 houses), where the river leaves the hills, 34 miles from the coast at the mouth of the river, and a similar distance from* Chalus.

Supplies.—Vide notes at each stage; plentiful on the whole, but stages 1, 2 and 3 are over sparsely inhabited country, the inhabitants of which have little surplus grain. Plentiful at Senna, Panjvin and Sulaimanleh. Transport.—A few mules and donkeys available at Senna, Panjvin and Sulaimanieh, otherwise for practical purposes nil. The Girdalan River is fordable as a rule and would not be likely to cause difficulty except in spring for a few days. Alternative stages .—See end of route for alternative routes between Panivin and Sulaimanleh.

Details. 1 DU\ IZEH .. 12 m. The route leaves • Senna passing to the 12 m. R-W. of “Plum Pudding Hill ” which is situated N. of the town. The main ■street through Senna from the Hamadan road is very narrow, steep, and difficult for wheels, and a road is required skirting the N.-E. edge of the town to “ Plum Pudding Hill.” This would take one company of Sappers and Miners one week. The track goes in a N.-N.-W. direction to mile. At £ mile794 ' Route No. 6 (h) — contd. it crosses a ndld 3' wide and 2' deep, where a ramp or culvert is required if the road is to be used permanently by wheels. On the W. of the rqad there is a ndld varying from 20 feet to 6' wide and 20' to 6' deep. The road is over soft red soil and becomes very bad in wet weather. From mile | there are vineyards on the E. of the road. At m. 11 the road rises over few hills with low rounded hills and vineyards on the E. and W. The village of Kami's lies f mile to the W.-N.-W. of the road. The road continues to rise gently over soft red soil to m. 4 up to which point there is no obstacle for wheels. The road is 10 to 20' wide ^nd the going is excellent. At m. 4, at the top of the rise, the track goes through a narrow shaped defile worn in the shaly rock. An. A. T. card, field gun, or Ford van could pass this by a short but steep detour to the E. for 30 yards. From this point the track descends for 200 yards, then passes over level ground for 200 yards and then rises gently for 200 yards over a cdl, lower than the one at m. 4. There is a similar defile in the rock at this point, but it can be similarly avoided. From this point to m. 51 there is a gradual descent, the track being bumpy and rocky. Ford vans could find a way with difficulty. At mile 41 the track takes a W. N.-W. direction. At m. 5J it crosses a watercut 3' wide, 6' deep. The road then descends steeply for 40 yards to a small stream running E.-N. E to the Qishlaq River. The bed of the stream is 20' wide wRh hard bottom and easy approaches; the water was 6' wide and 3' deep on 6th August 1918. At this point the track ceases to be passable for wheels. It leads in a N. direction and is only a narrow rocky path rising over a spur. A track to Aranau goes off in a N.-N.-W- direction. See end of stage 1. At m. 6 the road tops a rise and the going is very rockv. The road then descends steeply to the bed of a stream at m. 61. This stream flows down from Aranan to the Qishlaq River. The. bed, is full of willows, and is 15 7 wide. It has a hard bottom and easy approaches. The water was 8 / wide and 6' deep on 6th August 1918. The road rises to m. 7 passing several steep, narrow, rocky stretches. At m. the road crosses a ridld 5 / wide, 4' deep with steep sides of dry, soft soil. On both sides of the ndld the road is narrow and steep. At m 7f the village of Sufiaa is passed | mile to the E. of the road, an the left bank of a steam Sowiw!

On the W. of the road there is a hill 200—300' high separating this valley from the Aranan valley. The going is good over soft red soil. At mile 8J the road crosses a stream 6 / wide with 3 of water on 6th August 1918. The S. approach is narrow and difficult. At this point a track strikes off almost due A. up the side of a ridge which lies to the E. of the road, i he road continues over good going in aN.-W. direction keeping along the foot of the ridge to mile 10 where it begins to ascend the ridge. The road crosses the top of the ridge and Duvizeh is reached at about m. 12. The track to Aranan from &gt;m. Stage 1. This track from where it leaves the main road at m. 5J ascends to m. 6 and becomes bad and narrow. At m. it descends steeply to a stream flowing in a S.-E. direction, and crosses it by means of a rough single-span bridge of poplar poles; 18' span, passable for infantry, cavalry, and pack animals all in file. The stream is 25' wide, with hard bottom and banks 15' high. The water was 10' wide and deep, on 6th August 1918. The track follows the bank of a stream to Aranan (60 houses) at m. 7]-. This valley is well wooded with willows, poplars, and other trees, and there are many vineyards. A footpath strikes E. by N. across the hills to Suf'an. Another footpath strikes N. by E. over the hills, rising steeply for 1 mile, then falling to join the Sufian—-Du Izeh route at about m. 9| The'track is passable for infantry, cavalry, and pack animals all in file. From Aranan a track runs up the valley in a W. direction over a high pass leading after about 14 miles on to the track Senna—Mahrabxan—Avruman. This track is passable for pack animals only. From Aranan a track goes in a N.-W. direction. Tt is passable for pack animals only and is said to lead to the village ■of Towah. 2 BARRA\TSHKAR . .. 16 m.

At 104 m, a side track diverges to Bartidar, reached at 12 m.—leaving Barudar to one side continue up main valley along a stream; at 14 m. reach the pass known as Kal-i- Yaqhb (Plowden—Wilson); a sudden rise of about 500'. Just before the top the path forks : adopting the path to the right, Darravishkar is reached at 16 m. If however it is- desired to go on to Jannvarreh keep to left. Darravishkar is owned by Shaikh ’Ala-ud-DIn brother of Shaikh Najm-ud-DIn Na ^sh- bandi of Avruman, 50 houses. Fuel .—Can be purchased. Fodder.—Good 'grazing in season.

At 5£ m. leave the Kaleh Jnq valley (which drains to Durud village on the Sirvan) and descend to the Jannvarreh (Katawat, Katavan) stream. At 7 m. pass a large ancient mound at a point where a side-valley joins in: these lands are owned by the Bani Ardalan family, and are known as Kaku Zikri Ag'ba. At 11 m. pass below a high hill with a fine tree just below the summit on the N. side, known as Paimaneh-i- Balulakeh. The lands below are known as Jannvarreh : there is no village there, but tents may be expected in the summer. On the opposite side of the valley (N.) stands KSh Sultan Ahmad, with an isolated peak of about 9,000'. There is said to be a small plateau on top. and a cave, in which a chief called- Sultan Ahmad was buried : game on the hill is said to be immune to rifle shots owing to a spell cast by Sultan Ahmad. At 15 m. the track leaves the valley, the volume of water which has in the meanwhile been increased by the addition of several fine steams from the N., and ascends a spur from the S. face of Kuh Sultan Ahmad, and thus reaches at 14jr m. the797 Route No. 6 (h)-—cOntd. now deserted village of Jalileh, situated in a valley at the foot of the S. face of this hill. Thence the track crosses a series of spurs, with steep ascents and descents, till, at 17J m., the village of Shaikh Attar is reached in a small valley at the E. foot of the Garan pass and of Kuh Harmalah. Camping graund.- —Ample. SSCwTI 1&gt;lentif, * h Fodder.—Good, grazing. Supplies .—Very scanty. 4 MARI VAN .. 21 m. General direction W. • by S. From Shaikh 66J m. Attar there are three possible routes to Marivan : one track (a) runs N. from Shaikh Attar up the stream on which this village stands. This is only a foot-track, but the shortest way. Another crosses a low spur N.-E. of the village and descends to a stream coming from the Garan pass. One route (6) crosses it almost at once and ascends the ixill to the Mian Taq valley and thence on over the Garan pass : this is the lower route of the two, but longer, and not in regular use. The third route (c) follows this stream to 3£ m. from Shaikh Attar and then ascends the hill steeply to the Garan pass (7,000') reached at 5 m. This is the best route. From the summit a good view is obtained of the Bakhan valley to the W. end of the hills. Kuh Harmalah (10,000') lies to the S. of the Garan pass, with the wooded Mian Taq valley at its foot. The descent on the W. side of the pass is steep and rather difficult. The foot is reached at 64 m.—from the Garan pass onwards to near Panjvin the hills are well wooded and the track runs easily along bottom of narrow valley of Cham-i-Garan. At 7-|m. village Bakhan is 1 m. S. of road, up a side valley; at 10 m. village Flainan 1 m. 8. of road, up a side valley. At 11m. village Bard-i-Safid is 4 m. N, up, a side valley. At 12 m. the Cham-i- Garan stream falls into the Girdalan stream, coming N.-W. from the Tanureh valley, in which are 12 villages or more, all under Marivan. The two streams unite at the foot of a pro minent cliff known as Kah-i-Girdalan. At 13 m. reach a bridge across the Girdalan stream, now passable only on foot, 3 brick arches : built by Amanullah Khan Buzurg, a former Vail of Senna. There is a good ford just below the bridge :Boute No. 6 (h) — contd. the riyer is normally easy to cross, but is,impassable for a short time after heavy rains, and when the snows are melting : the river must be crossed here. At 4 m. the track bifurcates : the ri'^ht hand track runs to Astrabad, reached at lb m.; the left hand track continues'to the Marvian plain. Taking the latter pass at 141 m. village Harkanah Kuzalah on left bank of river, 1 m. to S. 'and Kaleh Kachal. At 17 m. cross stream coming from Astrabad. At 21 m. reach Mari' an fort, 150 yds. square, deserted and in ruins ; five old dismantled bronze muzzle- loaders remain, four more are said to be buried under the d6bris.

Turn S.-E. and follow river, which has steep cliffs along its far bank. On this side is a shingly bed about J mile wide, and then a stretch of marsh of about quarter mile. In spring the river fills this wide bed. On the left is a succession of low spurs, terminating in the banks under which the road runs. Between these are ravines down Which streams flow to join the Zab. The valleys are marshy, which makes them difficult to ford although not deep, .but in spring it would be necessary to ford higher up. At 4f miles pass through Kharaju, a small Mangur village under the bank. Cross a small stream in a wide bed of stone and shingle, pass through Kingari at 6 miles, another small Mangur village under the bank, and turn up left.

At 12| miles a similar ford to the last over the Vazneh river or Charava Su, at a ruined and deserted village on its left bank. Easv going over a flat plain, gradually rising. At 15| miles cross a spur 2,300 feet high, then steep descent into a ravine and over a stream. On the opposite bank at 16|- miles is a small village under a mound, on a spur which runs out as a sort of peninsula, having ravines with steep banks on three sides. This village, Kala DIzeh used to be the seat of the qaim- maqdm. It is now known officially as Mamurat-al-Hamid or Mamurat Hamidieh. There are a few Government buildings which form a settlement near the village. The telegraph office is connected by wire with Keui Sanjaq but not with Persia. On the mound above the village is a fort, and barracks at its foot. The fort contains a magazine and one bronze 2|-inch gun Leave Kala Dizeh ; descend the bank by a muddy path to the mound.

To right is a mound on whichRoute No. 6 (k) — contd. are the remains of an old castle. The road here bends right, good going on a flat plateau for about f mile, then begin ascent of spur, whence a fertile valley opens to view below to the right. In this valley is Bashir, a large village through which the road from Sulaimanleh to the Pishdar plain passes. Wind by a narrow rocky path round the hillside. The Bashir Su is 700 or 800 feet below in a narrow gorge. Round ing the spur, the path goes N.-E. ascending the ravine of Bashir Su and still keeping above its right bank. At 5| mile arrive at Bakhlu with 30 houses, elevation 3,900 feet. Con tinue winding up the ravine, general direction N.-E. Turn up valley to left and commen-ce a steep ascent. Reach plateau at 5,200 feet, cross it and commence another long and steep ascent, the sides of the mountains being covered with oak. A little plateau is immediately below the pass. On the right is a spring. Reach top of pass, 6,950 feet, at 9£ miles ; in heavy snow a detour to the right is necessary from here. Even and gradual descent, following a stream on the right, by difficult and winding path. At 13|-miles village Kanamashka (of Malkari Kurds) on left.

At 17-| miles, leave the valley of the Beauran Su, which flows down a ravine to the S.-E. Cross a couple of spurs and rise to a flat plateau. This plateau is covered with ploughed fields and crossed by a lane, 8 feet wide, almost impassable owing to deep mud in very wet weather. At 19 miles track to Maraghan branches off to the right over the hills. Short rocky ascent to 5,700 feet, from which Sardasht is to be seen 1J miles distant, surrounded oil all sides except one by hills, which slope own N -E towards the valley of the Zain, a succession of fields and w 11-cultivated terraces, Sardasht being on the highest of them, separated from the mountains on the N.-W. by a deep ravine.

General. —This route would form a main line of advance into N.-W. Persia, from Eastern Turkey in Asia, but although practicable for military purposes would entail much labour in preparation and upkeep for the passage of large forces. The nature of the road varies greatly from good going over open level ground^ to steep ascents and descents through close and hilly country or marshy and swampy plains. Between Al- vatan and Kaplisan it is passable for Ford vans with difficulty.Route No. 6 (l) — contd. The section Jairan to Urumieh is passable for Ford vans. The remainder of the route is passable for pack animals only. Climate. —Snow blocks the passes on the route leading out from Rama during January and February, and military opera tions along the route would not be practicable in winter. Supplies.- —The Urumieh plain is very fertile and productive, but supplies elsewhere are limited. Forage. —Grain is fairly plentiful in all the cultivated districts but would be difficult to obtain in the hilly parts of the route, while grass is scarce in the hills, though probably easier to get in the plain. The Lahljan plain produces a considerable quantity of wheat and barley ; it is very rich in meadow land. All crops are cut and stacked towards the end of July. Earlier in the year large quantities of green grass and Jchasil would be obtainable. The valley could support a large force for a considerable time. Fuel.- —A certain amount of forest is met with in the hilly parts, as well as stunted oaks and low scrub which would do for firewood. Dried cowdung is the chief fuel of the plains. The oak forests suddenly stop about 2 miles S. of Tarkash, stage 3. JFater.—Spring water and streams are plentiful along most of the route. Transport. —Pack buffaloes, donkeys and yabus can be got on the later stages near Urumieh, but it is doubtful whether in great numbers, while in the hilly stages very little would prob ably be available. Physical obstacles. —In some stages the road is too steep for extensive traffic, and would require much labour to lessen the gradient. The Sulduz Chai, Lesser Zab and Mstan Su are all difficult to ford and would be impassable in flood time, and at such times the whole of the adjacent marshy land Avould be impracticable to qnimals. Alternative stages.—Alternative Stage 1 between Ranla and Alvatan (stage 2) makes a detour over 44 miles longer than the main route, and can be further varied by intermediate hill tracks.Route No. 6 (?)— contd.

Easy track along upper part of Plshdar plain. A track leads across the fields to right to Baliq, a small Mamash village under the right bank. At 3£ miles pass cultivation to the left; valley narrows gradually and track gets more difficult. River winds consider ably. At 6£ miles valley closes in. Descend into a stream valley by a winding stairway, partly artificial in the rocks, and cross a stream. Track becomes more difficult from here. Pass some old ruins, cut stone, on the left. Path is now, difficult, winding along the rocky hillside above the river, with short, though steep, ascents and descents. At 8£ miles ford a stream from the N.-E., and, leaving the river-bed, ascend the side of the valley of a tributary stream among rocks, and then among scrub oak.Elevation 2,900 feet. At 10 miles steep ascent from valley of river, over a debris of rocks. On the opposite tank is a small Mamash village amid sloping fields. The river is in a shingly bed from 150—200 yards wide, with steep crumbling banks of red sandstone. Track very stony but not otherwise difficult, keeping along the hillside above the right bank of the river. Ascend shaly hillside over a spur. Pass Gurushir. A Mamash (Bilbas) village lies across the stream to the right. The Vazneh Su emerges from a gorge and track ascends to the N. Above its left bank is the plateau of Shanla, well cultivated, with a few small villages and houses scattered on it. Above it are gentle slopes covered with oaks, rising to spurs from the summits of the Assus Dagh. At 14J miles aga n descend the steep cliff on the right bank of the stream. Ascend a steep ravine from the ma n valley of the Vazneh Su by an almost precipitous path.- The path generally keeps some 20 feet above the stream but is broken away in places, when the stream has to be waded through. This is the most difficult part of this route. On the right, near the summit, is a small plateau, known as Margan, elevation 5,600 feet, with fields and cultivated terraces, deserted in winter. Ascend by a rocky, steep path, winding up the left side of a valley. Reach a col, and cross a ridge known to the local Kurds as Daulatvar ; the summit of the ridge, elevation 6,300 feet, passed at 16'! miles, forming the frontier. Steep, stony descent. Cross a tributary of the Vazneh Su, then three parallel spurs, over which the road is a sandy track, 12 feet wide, good going, after which wind among rocks. The Vazneh plateau makes a rough figure of 8. Keep first along the E. side of the southern loop, and then along the W. side of the northern loop. Cross the head waters of the Vazneh river, now 15 yards wide and only a few inches deep, at 19| miles ; from this point it flows S.- E. At 21| miles cross the plain of Vazneh Yaila, about 11 miles wide, enclosed by hills with steep, rocky sides, having a narrow opening close by to the left of the road, through which the Vazneh Su flows. A track to Sardasht branches off to the right. Leave the Vazneh Yaila through a gap in the hills to the N. Stony path winding among rounded, bare hills covered with gavvan.

An easy track along the wooded spurs which jut down into the river, following the right bank until it opens out into the Lahijan plain. The chief difficulties here are the passage of a number of small tributaries, which flow in deep beds cut out of the soft soil, but this gets easier as the plain is reached. Forests of oaks mostly stunted. Track would require improving in places for wheels. At 11 miles pass Tarkash village, belonging to Baiz Agha of the Mangur. Tarkash is 12J m., and Lahijan 20 m.

A few hundred yards further on a path branches left-handed, this is a short cut (the main track leading down the valley). A good mule track. After passing over one or two spurs, the first of which forms the water shed between the Jildian and the Halos valleys, the mule track, dropping to the level of the valley, rises again running along the sides of small spurs and passing above the village of Sufian at about 4 miles. Beyond an elevated valley about 1 mile in extent is crossed, after which the path drops to the level of the main valley and rejoins the main track. The country now entered is pasture land (several encampments). At about 7 miles a large spring and a clump of trees, and beyond the trees the end of a long spur is passed, which divides the valley in two. Beyond the spur the track crosses the stream in the valley and runs down the N.-W. side of it. At about 8 miles the village of Chaparava on S.-E. of valley is passed and at about 11 miles the village of Nalos is reached. Before arriving at Nalos turn left-handed across the fields across two water channels—leaving to the W. a hillock with a graveyard on it—and over a low spur. Immediately below the spur on its N. side is a track leading W. and from this track a second track strikes across the valley with a bearing of about 330° to Ushnu (a large wood seen across the valley). The Jarratu Su (Gadar R.) is crossed at 12 miles. A stream about 30 yards broad with about IS' of water flowing E. in a gravelly bed about 180 yards wide.

(?enem?.—This route does not describe tbe main caravan route&gt; but a more easterly one, lying very largely over low and swampy ground. From Ushnu to Urumieh is said by Maunsell to be very easily passable for guns, though the detailed description of the route appears to be against this. The remainder of the route, from Sauj Bulagh to Ushnu is variable, partly light and partly muddy and marshy. , . . , ,, . Climate. —The climate on the low-lying plains is probably not healthy, though precise details are not given, and is on the whole temperate, judging from the great fertility of the country passed. Military operations would, however, be impossible in winter on a large scale. . Supplies.—Large flocks and herds are mentioned in most stages, and supplies of all kinds should be plentiful in the fertile and populous plains. ForUf/e.-—‘Grazing is on the whole fair everywhere, but gets withered and burnt on the hills in summer. Fuel— Fuel is only mentioned in stage 3, but trees are plenti ful along most of the route, and could be utilized for the pur pose. . A Water.—Water is everywhere obtainable from springs and streams. The water of the irrigation cuts is however said to be unhealthy. Transport.—A limited number of very clumsy country carts are used to bring corn from the fields to the villages, but never for longer distances or any other purpose. Mules, donkeys and yah as are met in caravans, horses are found with Kurdish encampments in summer, and camels were met with in stage 2. Physical obstacles.—In stage 3 a small portion of the route near Ushnu would require some preparation before guns could pass. The irrigation channels all along the low-lying country would offer a great impediment, and very large quantities of willow fascines would have to be collected from the villages for the passage of any considerable body of troops, to facilitate827 Route No. 6(o)-—contd, crossing. The chief large rivers passed are theJarratuSu and 'Barondiiiz Chai, the approaches to which are very swampy. AIterntfHve rrmf as.The best route between Ushnii and T T i iimTeh is somewhat W. of the present one, and forms the main caravan route. Ko particulars are given beyond its keeping much closer to the mountains, thereby avoiding the low-lying and swampy plains, and hence being far preferable for troops, though the route followed here would probably be better for the collection of supplies.

General direction w.” ' “ N.-W. Leave Saul' wt. Bulaq starting from left bank of small stream on the N. side of the town, and follow a broad track 30 feet wide, lined with low, mud walls, through gardens and orchards containing almost every description of fruit. Gradual ascent up valley of Sauj Bulaq to a smaller valley, which is about 100 to 150 yards wide at the top. Bass over a ridge, the road leading for a short distance over rough strata of white, friable limestone into a flat basin among the hills, forming the head of a cultivated valley running down towards Sulduz to the right. In the centre of this basin, at 4 miles, pass Beh-i-Minhara, a village of 100 houses, half a mile to the right. After crossing basin, pass a Small valley bordered by low hills, which branches off to the left, and follow broad track going up a narrow ravine bordered by bate, brown hills, passing a large spring of clear, cold water, which forms a stream. Top of ravine is 5,215 feet. Road now makes a gradual ascent, skirting round the head of a valley to the right, underneath a high, rounded hill, with a rocky summit to the left, up to summit of a ridge 5,470 feet, forming the water shed that divides S uj Bula i and Si Iduz. Descend to valley from 200 to 250 j^ards wide, with rounded hills on either side that look easy to cross. Grass during summer (e.g., in July) burnt up, Easy gradient down the valley, track 8 to 10 feet wide and well-worn, over slightly stony clay soil. Bass village of 30 houses, Bizakarim, 5,070 feet, at 10 miles, about828 Route No. 6(o)— contd. 300 yards to the right of the track. Valley here about a quarter of a mile Wide; several patches of cotton afe grown in the upper or drier portions of these valleys* with a Small stream flowing down towards the track. Valley widens to 1 mile, with bare, rounded hills on each side ; track goes down to deep bed of stream, and across into valley growing wheat and barley crops. Several flocks of sheep, cattle, and a large drove of mares and young horses seen grazing on the plain. At 13| miles pass through, village Mameshah (short for Muhammad Shah), with 300 houses situated on either bank of a small stream, along which are 3 water mills and several irrigation channels. Large vineyard and some fruit trees and poplars on the S. side of the village. About 15J miles pass village Saka II Mustapha, 4,500 feet, with 100 houses, situated about H miles to the right, and surrounded by some good poplar trees, with large orchard and vineyard. Road here descends valley, about 3 miles wide, to small village of 40 houses, about a quarter mile to the right near a vineyard. Leave the valley, crossing over a low, flat spur, and turn to the left into the Suiduz plain. Just before leaving valley pass two gaseous iron springs with a strong taste, and quantities of gas bubbling up in a circular basin about 4 feet in diameter, with little water. Broad and well-frequented track skirting the foot of the hills On the left, and about 20 to 30 feet above the plain, thus avoiding canals. Pass village of mud huts built about 1888. Cross a spur with another but larger gaseous spring, similar to the two already met with. Track now 10 to 12 feet wide undulates over some low spurs, on good firm gravel, skirting a small canal to the right. About 1 mile to the right pass Baginkaleh at 21 miles, a large village of some 300 houses in the plain, with an orchard and some poplars and willows round it. Cross opening of a re-entrant loop in the hills running up to the left, cultivated with wheat but not irrigated. The swamps and canals are best avoided by keep ing close under the hills. Skirt along a spur, and come to a Second re-e itrant running about a mile into the bills on the left, with the village of KhalTfeh, consisting of about 50 huts, near a spring at the head of a re-entrant. Some small ravines with streams come down the hill above the village. Swampy road, skirting the foot of the hills, leads over several small canals toKuzeh- Giraa, village of about 150 houses clustered round a fort, about 50 yards square, with mud walls, surrounded by large orchard andRoute No. 6(o)— contH,. vineyards. This plain, like that of Urumieh, grows numbers of trees and large varieties of fruit. A few clumsy country carts are to be met with, but are never used in the hills, and only for carrying corn from the fields to the villages. The only drinking water here is from irrigation channels, though it is stale and liable to give fever. The difference between the water of a running stream and an irrigation cut is very marked, and the former should always be chosen in preference where possible. 2 USHNtj • • .. 23 m. General direction of road is W.-N.-W. f 48£ r)i. Turn S. from a small village joining main road, which keeps along the foot of the hills, and pass round the foot of rocky spur from the left. Wheat is grown without irrigation on the hill side, and grass is also found when not burnt up by the heat, a hundred camels were seen here by Maunsell. At 2 miles come to Nagadeh in the centre of the plain to the N.-E., and about 4 miles distant, a large place of 500 houses situated round the foot of a large gravelly mound, 500 yards in diameter, with a command of 50 feet over the plain. There are some good two-storeyed houses in Nagadeh, and gardens and orchards to the N. side of it. Across the plain to the N., up to the low hills bounding it on that side, is about 8 miles. It extends to the Urumieh lake on the N.-E., and is thickly dotted with villages, orchards and cultivation. Cross opening of a re-entrant running up about 1 mile into the hill on the left, coming to Chianeh village and fort at 4| miles, lying about half a mile to the right of the road. Lateral Route No. 6(0 from Ranla to Urumieh crosses at about this point. The village has 300 well- built houses, and is situated in the centre of extensive orchards and culti ■ ation. To the S. of it is a large fort, rectangular in shape, 400 by 200 yards which is commended from some low spurs from the hills to the S., at about 2,000 yards range. Skirt the foot of some spurs bounding the E. side of a small re-entrant running up to the left. A good deal of trouble is caused in getting mules over swampy ground and irrigation cuts which cross the road here. There are a few small bridges of fascines and tree trunks, but most of the streams and channels have to be forded At 61- miles pass a large village of 250 houses called Gurnava, surrounded by extensive orchards and cultivation about half amile to the right. Soil of Sukhiz plain is much richer than thatRoute No. Q(o)—contd. of Ushna. Cross the re-entrant, and then over some small spurs from the hills on the left. Broad, easy track skirting a canal to the right, 10 feet wide, with 2 to 3 feet of water, then passing to the left of some irrigated crops, cross a re-entrant running 1 J miles up some low, rounded hills to the left, and through a small village of 30 huts. Ford a channel, pass through an orchard, and past a water-mill on a large canal which follows the lower contour of the hills, the track skirting their base. Turn sharp to the left, leaving border hills on the S. of plain, the elevation of which enables the track to avoid the rice fields and canals in the centre, straight up which comes a direct path from Nagadeh. Broad and easy track 8 to 10 feet wide over upper part of Sulduz plain, which ends near village of Darband at 11 miles, elevation 4,6-80 feet, with 50 houses close to the right. Pass through a sort of strait dividing the Ushnu from the Sulduz plain, here a mile wide, bordered on either side by low, bare undulations, and spurs from the ranges further in with the river running down the centre. At about 11J miles, or rather more pass through village Kunikaleh of 100 houses, with a mosque, and small orchard. About 12J miles pass village of 50 houses a quarter mile to the right, surrounded by a few trees and with a small mosque. Pass some low spurs from the ridge N.-E of Ushnu, which form a division between the Sulduz plain just passed and the Ushnu plain now commencing, and stand on left bank of river. About a quarter mile S. of and beyond the river is village Bishams at 13 miles, 150 huts w r ith a small mos que at the corner. Soil here is a good, rich loam overlying gravel. At about 14 miles pass village of 30 huts on the left. These villages are less thriving and smaller than those of the Baranduz plain. Inhabitants are all Kurds (Sunnis). Track over dry and firm, gravely ridge to a canal, 15 feet wide and 2 feet deep, crossed by a gravelly ford with steep approaches. Cross several irrigation cuts down to the ford of the Jarratu Su river. Very heavy going for baggage animals, and, with more water in’the river, would be almost impassable. Ford of Jarratu Su is at this point (in July) 30 yards wide and about 2 feet deep, running in a narrow, gravelly bed, with a very rapid current in places. For about 300 yards beyond the ford on the left bank, the track passes through deep swamp with tall reeds and sedge. Continue over very muddy road and across831 “Route No. 6 (o) —contd, several deep irrigation cuts, along head of plain drained by the Jarratu Su. About a quarter mile to the left on the other side of the river, pass a low, gravelly mound half a mile long, with a command of 60 feet above the plain. On it stands a ruined mud fort, 100 yards square, with walls about 15 feet high, forming a good point to command the passage across the plain. A village of 50 huts, Kirkhar, situated at the W. end of the mound, is passed at 17 miles. Road now swampy from leakage of irrigation canals ; pass another village of 100 houses a little farther on and about 1 mile to the right. At 18-| miles, pass by the N. of Khaltavar village, also with about 100 houses, surrounded by a small grove of willows and poplars. Most of these villages 'have watch towers built of sun dried bricks and about 30 feet high, as a precaution against Kurdish raids. Cross several muddy irrigation cuts, with good grass by their banks. Through village Kurishava, with 50 houses, at 20 miles. Fair amount of wheat is grown, and patches of hemp, cotton, sesame and castor-oil are extensively cultivated, as also tobacco, melons, and various vegetables close to villages. Soil is a light, gravelly clay, deteriorating towards the head of the Ushnu plain, which has few trees except the clumps near villages. At about 211 miles ford a small river coming from ravine to the N.-W., 50 feet wide and a foot deep, flowing in a wide, gravelly bed. Most of the water at this season is led away for irrigation. Road now leaves the open plain, and a side track branches off through the gardens of Ushnu. Rejoin road, which passes through orchards for the last half mile, reaching Ushnu at 23 miles. Ushnu is enclosed by gardens and orchards, and many drinking fountains are provided along the roads leading through them Fruit of almost every kind is grown in abundance. The principal water-supply is from a small stream from the hills to the A.-VV. and from springs. The town, which is about 3 miles long and 1 mile wide extending along the foot of the hills, has about 1,000 brick houses. 2 CHASIMLAR •. 31 m. General direction N.

Leaving the gardens behind, cross over and descend a low, gravelly832 Route No. 6 (o)— contd. spur, passing village ’ Aliava at about 3 miles, with 50 houses about half a mile to the left in the plain. It has a high watch tower and stands in a small patch of orchard. At the head of a wide re-entrant in the hills, about 1| miles to the left and well cultivated, lies the large village of Nabivan, in the centre of a large stretch of orchards and vineyards, one mile by two, lining the foot of the hills. Cross the end of the re-entrant, round a clay spur on the left, by a broad well-defined track. Half a mile to the right is Singan, a village of 50 houses with two large watch towers, which is passed at 6 miles. Ushnu plain now ends, and track enters a valley by an easy gradient. Road skirts the foot of the border hills along the right of the valley about 300 yards wide ; cross the dry gravelly bed of a stream to foot of slope, which is ascended by an easy clay track forming a ledge cut in the hillside, and winding up hill by a long series of zig-zags with gradients from | to |. The steepest portion of this stage, and the only one that would require much preparation to render it suitable for carts, now commences from the stream valley about 6,025 feet up to a wide, grassy plateau, which keeps about half mile to the right of it. Road skirts to the right of the stream along the plateau, which has good grass when not burnt up by the summer heat. Pass a ravine beyond the plateau with a large stream flowing down it, coming from a wide flat valley, 6 miles to the right, containing a few small villages. Pass the head of the valley, about 6,030 feet, cross a narrow ravine, 80 feet deep, with a steep descent and ascent, and follow an easy field track 10 to 15 feet wide, gradually ascending the watershed separating the Ushnu and Barandfxz plains, the highest point of the ridge being 6,185 feet, passed at 11 miles. Cross a small undulation, and follow a broad, easy track to small village of Bashirin with 80 wretched huts, about a quarter of a mile to the left. At about 13J miles reach large village of Aghabulaq, elevation 5,920 feet, with some 200 houses standing on a bare knoll, situated at the head of a fairly well-cultivated and irrigated, flat valley, from 1 mile to IJ miles broad, extending about 5 miles to westwards. At 14 miles pass Ainarumeh, a village of 20 small huts to the left, beyond it a large spring to the right. Good track over rich clay soil with occasional outcrops of limestone, at 5,735 feet.

Gradual descent by a good, broad track, over a good clay soil mixed with laterite, with volcanic trachyte rocks cropping up here and there in places, down to ford of small stream, cross it and follow it down the valley to an open, undulating moorland, quite bare of trees, and growing o-ood hay by the stream banks and in the valleys. It is bounded by high, rocky, bare hills on either side, those on the W. being the hio-hesG Pass the moorland at 20 miles, follow rough, rocky ledge for 300 yards alongside an irrigation cut, with a wide grassv valley running up to the right. At 20-’ miles pass Sangat, a village of 30 huts on a spur to the right. The valley is here about half a mile wide, with open, undulating hills on either side and is a favourite spot for Kurdish encampments in the summer. There are several patches of green grass in the valley and on the hill sides. A grassy valley, 600 to 800 yards wide, elevation 5,227 feet, runs up to the right in the direction of a high, rocky peak, about 4 miles distant. Also a long valley, a quarter mile wide .to the left, with a strong stream flowing down it. Pass round foot' of rocky spur projecting from the left, the track for 50 yards being in the bed of a stream ; elevation here 5,100 feet, and valley is from 300 to 400 yards wide with fairly steep sides. Valley then narrows to 100 or 150 yards, with rockv sides, and a fairly easy track, direction 48°. At about 23J miles turn sharp to the left in direction of 330°. Easy track, 10 to 12 feet broad, near stream ; alongside the latter grow young willow, stunted ash, elm, walnut and several kinds of shrubs, which are, how ever, lopped for firewood before they attain any height.’ Hay is also cut and gathered in for winter use. A valley opens into a cultivated basin half mile wide, near which a small cluster of 10 huts called Salani lies to the right at 25 miles. A little farther, cross a stream about 6 feet wide and 1 foot deep, flowing down a’ long, narrow valley to the left, with shrubs bordering the banks, and a small foot-bridge of fascines and tree trunks. The track is rough and stony, and the valley opens out to 400 or 500 yards, bordered by rounded hills. Long, narrow valley runs up to the left, and more sites or Kurdish encampments are passed. Plenty of good grazing is to be found on these hill slopes. At about 27 miles, valley again narrows to 150 or 100 yards, with steep, rugged C/OGSB ~ 3 b 3Route No. 6 (o)— contd. cliffs of limestone on either hand. Track is stony in places, but gradient easy. Track is now from 8 to 10 feet broad, rnwch used by mule and donkey caravans, and crosses the rnimlh of a narrow, rocky valley running N.-E. Large herds of sheep and cattle seen grazing on the hillside, where large numbers ■of Kurds from the villages camp out during the summer. In the centre of the valley pass Shaikhah, a village of 30 mud huts, at 28£ miles. The hills bordering the valley, which is narrow, are steep clay slopes rising as they get farther back. Small patches of cultivation are visible near the stream, and cotton and sesame are grown more on the high ground. The villages in the valley, which now gets wider, are much smaller and poorer than those of the plain farther on. Springs in the ravines on the hillsides are plentiful, and are marked by patches of green grass around them. At about 30 miles pass a 'collection of some 20 huts on the hillside, 200 yards to the left, near a spring and a clump of trees. Track is along a ledge 20 feet wide, in the hill sides, avoiding the irrigation channels to left bank of a stream. Crossover to the right bank, and at 31 miles reach Chasimlar, a • village of 50 huts in the centre of the valley, with a small orchard, growing apricots, and a vineyard, elevation 4,510 feet. 4 URUMlEH .. ., 27J m. General direction N. Follow bank of stream 107m. by a narrow track through swamp and rushes, going down the valley. The track greatly improves, but continues swampy in parts from the leakage of irrigation cuts, and goes along to the end of the valley down which the stream flows. The exit of the valley, which is quarter mile wide, is barred by a circular, flat-topped mound, 50 yards in diameter, on which are the ruins of some old buildings ; track leads on either side of it. In the plain, at the foot of the mound, is the large Mussulman village of Chucha, passed at 1| miles, with 200 houses mostly well built of sun-dried bricks. There is a small fort, 50 yards square, with mud walls, 20 feet high, built as a protection against Kurdish raids. For the next 24 miles, the track, now leaving the valley, makes for the foot of the low and bare range of hills, that bound the Baranduz plain on the S.-E, following the same stream from the valley *ome 5^ miles to Jundarll. At the foot of the hills, pass village of Tamatar at 4 miles on the right, with 150 houses, standing835 Route No. 6 {o)—contd. amongst orchards and vineyards. Population consists of a mixture of Mussulmans and Armenians. Several carts to be seen about here. Very easy going over a good, broad track down to village of Taluchan, consisting of 30 houses on the right bank of stream, occupied by Massalmans, with 150 more houses on the opposite side, which are Armenian and Nestorian. T ord the stream, which in summer flows in a shallow bed about , feet .^oad. The track, which is now broader, is lined with elms, willows and a few poplars, and continues along the same stream that passes Jundarll. The stream runs in a narrow, gravelly bed, lying from 10 to 15 feet below the level of the plain, t rack enters a narrow lane bordered with hedgerows of briars and vines, and on leaving the lane makes a sharp turn to the left, joining the main route which comes across the plain from the direction of Sulduz. At 7 miles again ford the stream, here 30 fe ?u tr!’ ° n the edge of which stands the village of Jundarll with 200 houses, surrounded by a mud wall some 20 feet high round three sides, with flanking towers at intervals, leaving the east side exposed. Pass through very enclosed country, wooded with chenar, poplar, ash, sycamore, elm, willow and several kinds of fruit trees. The road is from 15 to 20 feet wide, running between mud walls, 6 to 8 feet high, enclosing orchards and vineyards. Pass through village of Zavitch with 80 houses, mostly of sund-ried brick, and containing a mixed population of Mussulmans and Christians, chiefly the latter. Come to right bank of Baranduz Chai riyer, which makes a large bend from here to the N., with a foot-bridge about a quarter mile down the stream, made of poplar trunks resting on trestle piers. Lower down still, at Sadaru, is a masonry bridge. Track here makes a chord in an arc formed by the bend of the river, winds in and out between orchards and vineyards for about half a mile, then leaves the plain and follows the right bank of the river for about 500 yards down to the ford of the Baranduz Chai, about 40 yards broad and 2-| feet deep at this point. The stream is rapid, run ning over a gravelly bottom, with easy banks and approaches ; the river flows down the centre of the plain towards Urumieh Lake. Leave the river and pass Christian village of Dizartacheh at about 8J miles, with 200 houses mostly well built of sun- dried bricks. On the outstkirts is a mosque surrounded by a few Mussulman houses.

This mound is a good posi tion for a work defending the passage of the roads leading across tho plain. Two of the towers of the fort are much crumbled a wav, and the walls are out of repair. There is a gate on the S -W side, and the walls are 20 to 25 feet high. The road skirts round the foot of the mound, passing it at 9 miles, down to banks of a canal lined with poplars and willows. Canal is 15 feet wide and is crossed by a good bridge of logs and fascines, with a layer of earth on the top. Track is now 20 to 30 feet wide wdth a low mud wall on either side, enclosing extensive vineyards. Some carts to be seen drawn by four oxen harnessed m pairs. The y are only used to draw corn or produce from the fields to the village, and never to go into the town or beyond a shorfi distance in the plain. Cross another canal, about 15 feet wide and 3 feet deep, by a bridge similar to the last. Leave the main^ track which here makes a d tnvr through Saralan. At about 11 miles pass large village of Saralan with about 150 houses at the foot of the slope, and about three-quarters of a mile to the left. Track takes a bend to the N.-YV., and then at 13 miles passes throimh Karallar, situated on the edge of same canal as Saralan, the canal being 20 feet wide by 2 deep, with a ford across it. The ground off the track is all deep, clinging mud, and this ren ders a short cut across the bend of the ford quite impassable. The banks of the canal are lined wdth some good poplars, chenars and willows, and above on the hillsides are a few vineyards. There are some large rice fields in the plains lower down. Soil is a rich black loam, very fertile, and round the village were patches of Indian corn, potatoes, castor-oil, melon and cucum bers. Several large villages are dotted about the plain, specially in the direct'oa of the lake. Beyond Karallar the road divides into two, the main track and principal caravan route branching off northwards and leading direct to Urumleh over the hills, thus a Ambling Sar.

At 17J miles pass through Mussalmah village of Gatailu with 80 houses, surrounded by a small orchard, with some fine poplars, and a few small melon and vegetable gardens. Clover and lucerne (gaganja) are grown mixed together. Some fields of dhdJ are also seen. Track now lies through rice fields, and is continually intersected by numbers of small canals : this renders the way vphy difficult for mules and other animals which constantly sink knee deep into the soft clay and mud. Cross irrigation canal, which follows contour of adjoining hill, and join the more westerly, and main caravan route from Ushnu, which is rather shorter and lies at the foot of the border hills, ‘ thereby avoiding the irrigated ground of the plains traversed by this route. Elevation here 4,580 feet. Ascent towards Mount Sair now begins. Soil is a good clay and would grow wheat without irrigation. .The spurs here give a fine view of the Baran- duz plain. There is good grass on them, but it is much burnt up in summer. Mount the summit of a broad spur, from where the direct road to Urumieh strikes off. At 22 miles reach the American Mission House, elevation 5,160 feet, surrounded by a high mud wall, with flanking towers at the corners, and, cluster ing just outside it on the east, the village Sair with some 60 houses occupied by Protestant Christians. Water is obtained from two large springs higher up the hill. Mount Sair itself is a rounded hill, lying to the S.-W. of the village and some 2,000 feet above.it. Some green grass to be found on the upper slopes and cultivation all down the sides. Southern slope is steep and rocky, and several herds of sheep and cattle are to be seen on the hillsides.

At 5J miles a track comes in from the right rear, which comes direct from Habibabad, passing (Jumisheh 1 mile to the W. This is 1 mile shorter than the main route, and should be taken if it is not intended to stop at Qumisheh. Jahanabad lies about 1 mile to the W. from here. At 6 miles enter a valley with low rocky hills 1 mile to the right and 1£ miles to the left. Road excellent. At 9f miles hills on the right recede to 3 miles, and those on the left approach to J miles. Good grazing in this valley.

Very gradual ^ m - descent down a valley, 200 yards broad, the road at times following the bed of the torrent. This bed is occasionally flooded in a very rainy year, but it is said to run down in 24 hours. The sides are sloping, high and firm. At 3 miles valley opens out to 500 yards, with rocky peaks on either side, and a mountain track to Ardistan strikes off to the left, north-west. At 3f miles a road going to Zavareh is visible and at 3£ miles two peculiar rock pillars catch the eye in the range to the N.-W. They are 15 or 20 feet high and have the appearance of human figures.

The next ^ mile is somewhat rough and broken up and in its present state would be difficult for wheels, the ravine at one point being only 80 or 90 yards broad. At 5 miles cross a dry torrent-bed and at 5J miles ascend a rocky knoll, which culminates 250 yards farther on at height of some 1,650 feet above Ardistan. Over rocky knolls and diminutive hills ; at 5 J miles a track goes off to the right to Mashandi. At 6^- miles cross a dry torrent-bed, 90 yards by 2, and cross it again at /J miles, the intervening ground being undulating over low sandstone hills.

Leave Julfa, 14 m. the Armenian suburb of Isfahan, by the road on the S. bank of Zindeh Rud, in order to avoid the wretched way among the old graves and ruins of the suburbs on the N. bank. From the Great Shah Virdi bridge it is about f of a mile to the Pul-i-Chfibi which is however built of stone, and J mile more to the Khaju bridge, which, very beautifully built, spans the river on 21 arches. This bridge has a high pitch, but has a parapet and is passable for guns. The river may be crossed here or about 2 miles further on at the Sbahristanak bridge, at the north side of which stands a minaret among some ruins. From here the path leads in a northerly direction to join the main road in the ■neighbourhood of Khuras- kan (Khorasjun), Several small villages are passed on the way notably at 7 miles and 8 miles. These villages, two of which are called Khatnabad and Gavart, are watered entirely by the canal wduch flows from the Zindeh Rud. The road then'rises on a gravelly slope by a fairly good track to go through a small chain of lulls isolated from the larger mountains lying to the N. These hills would make a good defensive post for protecting Isfahan from the E. At 13] miles pass a vallev on the right of the road surrounded by a high mud wall; at m another large one lying some U .miles off to the right, and a third f miles to Ibe left.

Then over kavir, which becomes heavy after rain. At 10J miles leave the kavir tract and pass over firm ground. A raised footpath, with culverts through it, helps to di’ain the road into a ditch on the farther side of it. At I2J miles over kavir soil once more, which grows firmer as Sagzi is approached. Sagzi is a village flanked with round corner towers. Three hundred and fifty inhabitants ; crops of wheat, cotton, hemp, and castor oil; there is a good solidly built sarai.

Road ascends up a dry stream bed. At 3f mile up a narrow valley between low hills by a good road. At 4J m. pass a hamlet. At 6 mile pass the hamlet of Yazd. Then on up an ever narrowing valley, where snow sometimes lies. At 7 miles Faizabad. Road easy; ascends gently between hills. At Ilf- miles cross the Laghirak pass, about 625 feet above Faizabad. Summit of the pass lies about 150 yards from the low accessible hills on either side. Pass is usually said to be closed after 1st January owing to the heavy snow. Caravans can take a lower road. On descending down the valley, another valley branches off J mile right from this point, and the village in it is 600 yards to the right of the read.

From Laghirak 96 to. the road descends winding along between the hills, until it emerges at their foot on a glacis slope facing E. on which, some 4 miles from the last of the hills, is situated the large village of Bambiz. In the valleys between the hills a good many villages are passed, each provided with a small tower. Podar, the largest of these villages, situated about 7 miles from Laghirak, has a good-sized square fort. Most of the villages, we were told, are the property of inhabitants of Fain. The last of the hills passed before de bouching on the plain are of dark and fantastic form. One of them, by the side of the road, 4 miles from Bambiz, is a508 Route No. ~V(j)—contd.

Meshed-i-Sar [Lateral Route No. 1(A)] to the E., and Kazvln via Killshum, and Dailiman district to Langarud [Lateral Route No. ¥111(0)] to the W. Both of these as a rule remain open throughout the winter. The Salambar route comes third and is much better than the intermediate routes via Haraz valley (Main Route No. I), via Baladeh and Kujur [Lateral Route No. I(Z)] or Chalus [Lateral Route I(n)]. ■ It is a mule track through stony mountainous country with steep gradients and zigzags, unmetalled, but kept in fair repair in the more difficult sections where' it is frequently built up along rocky ledges,, or winds like a ribbon along precipitous hill sides. The surface is less bad than that of other Elburz routes. It is passable throughout for infantry, mountain artillery, pack mules and donkeys, for cavalry with difficulty and for Ford vans only for the first 7 miles, see paragraph (b) below. Beyond stage 1 it could not be made passable for wheeled and beyond stage 4 even for camel transport without excessive labour. ■ By Alternative Route 1 camels can reach stage 4 without difficulty.

Camels cannot accomplish this ascent without considerable risk, and below Saribalan, 79 miles, the forest track becomes too slippery for them. From 58J miles to Salambar ridge at 65 miles the ascent is steady and gradual. Descent to Maran, 71 miles, is steep but easy. Zigzag descent to 73 miles is precipitous.

RangenorthofKazvin.—These bills, which are the south ern boundary of the Shahrud valley, form a continuous ridge varying from 7,000' to 8,000' in height. They are brown and barren except for a few weeks in April and May but give rise to numerous small streams which cut narrow valleys and irrigate strips of cultivation where they debouch on to the Kazvln plain. On the Shahrud side the slopes are more fertile and produce unirrigated crops, and the valleys support a succession of small villages. The level of the Shahrud valley is considerably below that of the Kazvin plain and the last part of the descent down to it is steep along all routes. Paths over this range may be closed by snow storms in De cember, January, and February but normally only for a few days at a time. 2. Shahrud and Alamnt valleys.—Both rivers are unfordable from about 1st March to 15th June, the dates varying each year according to the accumulation of snow on the mountains and the early or late advent of spring. During this flood season Alterna tive Routes 1 or 2 must be taken. At normal low water level, the Shahrud is 35' wide and 1|' deep. The Shahrud valley is a wide sloping basin through the bottom of which the river cuts a deep clifl-bound passage from £ to 1 mile in width. It is filled by the stony water course and affords no room for cultivation, and the villages are located up the small side valleys. The Alamut valley, above the defile into which it contracts for 3 miles before joining the Shahrud, is more open, but the larger villages are similarly situated upon the hills. Outstanding physical features are— 1. Range of hills north of Kazvin. 2. Shahrud and Alamut valleys. (e) Out standing Physical Features.516 Route No. VI(6)— contd. These valleys are very hot in summer, and some ricefields in Alamut as far as Khushkidasht, 48 miles, produce mosquitoes and malaria. Behind Garmarud, stage 5, the Alamut valley contracts into a narrow cliff-bound gorge, out of which the road climbs by precipitous zigzags. 3. Elburz Ridge .—This ridge is the dividing line between the plateau of Persia and the Caspian provinces. To the S. of it the country is everywhere bare, while to the N. vegetation com mences a few hundred feet below the crest, small oak trees at 8,000' and forest between 7,000' and 6,000'. The summit of the ridge is remarkably uniform in height. It is not pierced by a pass and the route crosses over the top of it at Salambar. To the N. lies a tangled mass of mountain and valley and the Caspian is not visible. The winter gales and snowstorms from December to March along this ridge are very severe and dangerous, but the passa- bility and the impassability of routes across it depend, at this season, less on their elevation than on the formation of the land, the direction of the wind and the way in which these cause the snow to lie or to form deep and impassable drifts. The Salam bar route despite its elevation is usually kept open by local muleteers and seldom closed for more than 2 weeks at a time. They build cairns at short intervals and after each fresh fall of snow feel their way from cairn to cairn, thus for mi ng a hard and beaten track of frozen snow*. In spring when this commences to thraw and the surface becomes treacherous, they are obliged to dig a path through the drifts. 4. Seh Bazar Ravine .—Below Saribalan this is a narrow winding defile between rocky forest-clad mountains towering 4,000' to 5,000' above, and affording a narrow channel to the torrent which by reason of its swiftness is unfordable when in flood between 1st March and 1st July and must be crossed by numerous wooden bridges. Below its junction with the Do Hazar at 95J miles it is prac tically unfordable at all seasons. Below Gavbar, stage 6, (89 miles), mosquitoes, horse flies and the hot humid climate render the country poisonously un healthy from June 1st to September 15th. To escape the horse flies muleteers (chdrvddars) usually march by night in this season. These conditions are accentuated as lower levels areRoute No. VI(6)— contd. entered and reach a climax in the malarial rice swamps of Tuna- kabun, which owing to the intensity of the cultivation is the most unhealthy district along the whole of the south-eastern Caspian coast. From May to September when viewed from the Ghalleh Cardan ridge in stage 7, the plain is a huge swamp of ricefields, and the villages stand out as islands. 1. Intermediate halting places in stages exceeding 18 miles .— Stage 7 of 21 miles can be divided into 2 stages of 16-1 and 4| miles, respectively by halting at KhurramaLad. 2. Drinking water .—The supply is practically speaking un limited throughout the year at every stage, for men from excel lent springs and for animals from the streams and rivers. 3. Supplies .—Villages in Alamut, stages 3 and 4, are numerous but poor and only sufficient crops are produced for 4 or 5 months maintenance of the population, two-thirds of whom go to Tuna kabifn and work as labourers in rice fields from autumn to spring. Those who remain import rice for their needs. As a minimum estimate 30 to 40 men and 30 mules could be billeted for a night without previous arrangement in most villages of 30 houses, but for a party stationed in this valley grain would have to be fetch ed, rice from Tunakabun, wheat and barley from Rudbar. The group of fertile villages in the Muallim Kaialeh basin, 4 miles N. of the Badasht and Dikin, 3 miles W. of these, are just across the Rudbar boundary and serve as a granary for Alamut. Grain for larger parties than those suggested above could of course be obtained from Alamut villages, but only by ruthless requisitioning. In spring before the harvest the population live from hand to mouth and grain stocks are very low indeed and difficult to obtain even by requisitioning. Other supplies, sheep, mast, milk, butter, eggs, honey, and firewood are obtainable as in other Elburz villages. Tea, sugar and vegetables are scarce and expensive and should be carried. At Garmarud, stage 4, and Maran, stage 5, the villagers collect supplies to sell to the chdn dddrs who in winter may be delayed by snow blocking the Salambar ridge and could supply 50 men and 50 animals. Beyond Maran in the Seh Hazar valley in stages 6 and 7 the villages are few and small. In summer at Maghzilat and Gavbar, stage 6, supplies are obtainable for 30 men. Fodder is plentiful but at Gavbar518 Route No. VI(6) — contd. barley cannot be obtained for more than 10 animals. In winter no supplies are obtainable here except from the small villages of Khanian above Maghzilat. Below Khanlan no more villages are passed until the Tunakabun plain is entered in stage 7. The Do Hazar valley {vide stage 7) has considerable, and Kalardasht {vide paragraph 15, section 6 and remarks in stages 5 and 7) across the range E. of Seh Hazar, very large supplies. In the Tunakabun plain supplies, including vegetables, for men can be obtained in any quantity with the exception that rice would have to be substituted for bread for a party of more than about 50 men, until wheat could be fetched from Kalar dasht or Do Hazar. Animals of the country also are fed on rice and rice straw, a diet which disagrees with animals used to barley and bhoosa. These can be obtained by fetching from Do Hazar or Kalardasht. 4. Transport .—Persian mules are excellent and carry loads of 200 to 250 lbs., but this route is not too difficult for others less accustomed to mountain tracks. Some 1,000 mules are engaged in the carrying trade along it, taking loads of rice, charcoal, and oranges, from Tunakabun and raisins, tobacco, salt, walnuts, etc., from Kazvln. In winter they work principally between Tunakabun and Maran, where rice and charcoal are stored, and in summer when the lower forest levels are infested with horse flies and mosquitoes, between Maran and Kazvin. In spring and autumn they make through journeys. • ° From mid July to mid August the majority of mules are taken to the highlands to graze and the muleteers are busy harvesting. The muleteers on this road, who are natives of Alamut and Talaghan, Gazur Khan, Atan, and Khusakichal (near Gazer Khan), Balaruch (near Zavarak), Garmar d, and Avanak, are said each to own atlea,st 100 mules, and many other villages own from 10 to 40, but as they are usually absent on a joumev it is umvise to count on obtaining transport locally and it should be hired from Kazvin. Only a small party requiring not more than 6 mules experiences no difficulty in hiring them for 1 hmum each from stage to stage. The villagers, except professional chdrvd drs, dislike going more than one stage from their homes, and if re quired to go further will abscond at night unless watched.519 Route No. VI(&amp;)— contd* winter igesof 'illages &gt; lie rdasht and?) es, for n that f more Mr- on rice barley flazar ads of is less »ng it, kabun ™ter where lower itween irough taken sting. it and Gazer ssaid [from wise Ifrom mules from \ m, if re in case of a military expedition requiring transport all mule owners would almost certainly take fright and drive their mules into the mountains. Ponies, not mules, are used in Tunakabun by the peasantry for local work, and there are probably not less than 2,000 ponies within a radius of 7 miles from Khurramabad. They are not kept for hire and could only be obtained by requisitioning, and to prevent their concealment in the forest is most difficult. These ponies are superior to mules for work on the soft wet ground of the Caspian provinces but are much inferior to them on the mountains. No mules are obtainable in Tunakabun except those engaged in the carrying trade along this road. . 5 Puel Dry wood and charcoal is obtainable from all villages, and wood can be collected in unlimited quantity from the forest below Saribalan. Quality is good. , 6. Grazing. A—Excellent grazing is obtainable in Alamut as follows :—■ I On the slopes between Alamut and Talaghan, near Avaj, situated about 5 miles above Safidar (see stage 4) This pasture is considered the richest in Alamut, and maintains some 3,000 sheep, 200 mules, and 300 cows. Were the sheep removed it would be sufficient for at least 1,000 horses and camels. This is the only grazing ground suitable for camels as the slopes are gentle. Grazing season is from March to August. II. On the open moorland surrounding PTchabun, see stage. This pasture maintains some 1,000 sheep, 200 mules, 200 cows, and should suffice for 800 horses and mules were the sheep driven offi It is inaccessible for camels owing to the difficulty of approach from Gar- marud. „ , r, , i Grazing season is from 21st March to 30th September. III. Evatlr at the head of the Alamut valley. It is reached by a track of 4 miles from Narmlat, see stage 5, or a good track of some distance from Pichabun.

Additional Work necessary. —No extra work is required for this route as a mule track. To make it passable for wheels would be a prodigious engineering work, far surpassing the con struction of the Kazvm-Resht road in difficulty. Any improvement of the ascent from the Alamut gorge in stage 5 would also be extremely difficult as the road would re quire regrading. For the boulder- strewn forest sections of stage 7 stone paving or a metalled surface are the only solutions, both being most laborious. 9.

Inhabitants. —Villages of 20 to 60 houses cluster in the narrow vallej^s of the hills between the Kazvin plain and Shahru d, especially on the northern, i.e., Shahrud side. Alamut com prises some 66 villages, the largest being Atan, near Uazur Khan, 220 houses, Kuchanan, near Shahrak, 150 houses, Gazur Khan, 150 houses, Garmajud, 100 houses, Balaruch, near Zavarak, 100 houses, Virk near Zavarak 100 houses. The district of Rudbar, N.-W. of Alamut down the Shahrud valley, comprises about 100 villages, and is much more populous and fertile. Small and poor villages are grouped in the Maran and Mian Rud valleys, and near their junction where they form the Seh Hazar. Below Saribalan, stage 6, the Seh Hazar ravine affords no cultivable land and, with the exception of the village of Khanian, and of the summer settlements of Maghzilat and Gavbar, is only inhabited by nomadic shepherds. The Do Hazar valley supports some 25 and Kalardasht 30 prosperous villages. The Tunakabun plain possesses sufficient water from the Mazar river for the irrigation of its whole surface and is densely populated. The villages do not average more than 20 to 30 houses, but are very close together.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100025473238.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/12/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025473238.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/12/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'ROUTES IN PERSIA VOLUME II.
