'940 J Many thanks for your letter P.Z. 4163/1940, of the 26th July, regarding the Viceroy’s suggestion that a Pan-Islamic Conference might he convened to encourage Moslem feeling against Axis expansion in Mahommedan regions. 2. We concur in the views expressed in the second paragraph of your letter and agree that such a conference might do more harm than good. Apart from the problems connected with the assembling of the conference, there would be the difficulty of controlling its deliberations once it had met. We might well find that, instead of confining itself to the purpose for which it had been called, it might degenerate into an anti-British meeting, and that each delegation might vie with the others in putting foward claims for the indepence of its own particular country. Further, anyone disposed to criticise our /measures R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C.measures for the defence against Axis expansion of British territory inhabited by Moslems might take the m opportunity to voice his views at the Conference. Yours sincerely,i 94 o r 6 JUL Our Seere\pry is.f■ St-a^-^xias recently received a private telegram from the Viceroy in which he puts forward the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should consider whether they ought not to try to encourage and strengthen the obvious feeling among Moslems that Axis expansion in Mohammedan regions is against the interests of Islam, and possibly with that object in view take steps to promote somewhere a Pan- Islamic Conference which might voice these feelings. Lord Linlithgow expresses doubt whether India, which is a follower rather than a leader in Islamic activities, would be a suitable venue for such a Conference and suggests that possibly Cairo or somewhere in Egypt would be suitable. Our own view is that the idea of such a Conference bristles with so many difficulties, e.g. the * choice of venue, the selection of delegates, the topics for discussion, the convening authority, etc., that it is likely on the whole to do more harm than good, but we should be grateful if you would consider the suggestion and let us have your views. Lord Linlithgow's desire to encourage Moslem feeling against Axis/Axis expansion in Mphammedan regions is of course perfectly sound, and any propaganda in this direction would he all to the good; we understand however from the Ministry of Information that this is in fact already the main theme of their propaganda in Islamic countries, and there is probably little further to be done except to go on hammering it in.

R. reelCopy of telegram from Vicerdy to Secretary of State dated 14th July, 1940« 528 ^ sfv jk 1&lt;f/7/h \ls SECRET XXX 1369S* Private and personal* I know how familiar you are with the Middle East and your interest in Arabic countries* i have wondered once or twice whether it was worth suggesting that you might, consider whether His Majesty v s Government ought not to try to encourage and strengthen the obvious feeling among Moslems that Axis expansion in Mohamedan regions was against interests of Islam, and possibly even to consider practicability and desirability (as to which His Majesty-s Government are in a much better position to reach any conclusion than we can possibly be here) of promoting somewhere a Pan-Islamic conference which might voice these feelings* There are I think very obvious objections to choosing India which is a follower rather than a leader in Islam activities, but it is just conceivable that if you thought there was anything* in the idea at all it might be worth sounding Lampson as to whether Qairo or -Egypt might not be a useful venue. I seem to have seen recently a speech by Rector of AX Azhar University, in which he referred to Cairo as centre of Islam, though I am of course wall aware that Ibn Saud or the King of the Yemen would be likely to take a very different view of any such claim, and that full weight would have to be given to risk of any stressing of it giving rise to dissensions between various Islamic countries rather than promoting single front against Axis expansion, which we should be anxious to see.14 6130 16473 ( 4 ) In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. X t't' ■ and address —to any person by name, bvlt to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.VV. i m a Q THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to £ / f*~ X '. ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copy of the under-mentioned paper.

The visit of Emir 3a.oua to Palestine which occupied the attention of nationalist ieauers, was made tne occasion of manifestations and large crowds of Arabs flockea to see the **rab prince. There are two features which aeserve comment; It is clear that Haj Amin Hussein! aesirea to exploit these manifestations to show his power ana prestige to tne guest. It appears that the latter has been impressed with the belief that Haj Amin is tne only capable leader in Palestine. Haj Amin's efforts, have, of course, displeased other political factions. The Defence rarty in particular objected to the arrangements which were mostly left to Haj Amin, but they were unable to do anything, and although its leaders attended official and non-official receptions, they aid not cooperate with tne Arab Reception Committee. The Istiqlal Party, as such, has disappeared from tne scene ana had it not been for the visit of certain Syrians, no mention would have been made of it. The Youngmens* Executive were also not satisfied as tney believe tney were not ^iven sufficient cnance to show themselves or attract public attention. The ^rab public was gratified at tne receptions * accorded/ aaccoraea oy Government to an Arat prince ana appreciatea its good will in allowing tne gratis to snow tneir sympathies. Crowds were enthusiastic. The warm receptions at every place the jdnir visitea ana at every village ne passed, were impressive ana called to mine tne receptions accoraea to the late King i’eisal. Political speecnes were aeliverea at various places, pointing to Arab grievances ana tne alleged dangers threatening tne country, attacking Zionism, ana hoping i'or aeliveranee at tne hanas of the Wahabite potentate. It woulu appear tnat tne visit of Emir Saouu to Europe ana Palestine haa tne effect of airecting tne attention of the Arabs to Ibn Saouu ana tne peninsula, lifter the aeath ox Kin^ Eeisal, to whom tne politicians looked for leaaership, the Arabs were not certain as to which siae to turn; some suggested support to King Ghazi, while others rallied rouna Ibn Saoua. At present, however, the consensus of opinion is to rally under the banner of Ibn saoua who proves himself to be the strongest Arab ruler. The visit has also afforaea an opportunity to the politicians who gatnerea in Jerusalem from Palestine ana Syria to meet tne Emir, to exenange views on the political situation. Meetings took place at tne nouse of Nabih el Azmeh ana Cwni Abael Haul ana it is understood tnat one also took place at tne house of Haj Amin Husseini. These leaders aiscussea the state in Arab countries ana the policy which should be pursued by them in case a war breaxs out between Italy ana Abyssinia ana other European powers become involved. They agreed: (a) that Yemen, Hejaz ana Ir^q should remain neutral; (b) upon tne declaration of war, delegations of tne Istiqlal Party should be sent to these three Arab territories to ensure tnat the Governments remain neutral; (c) to renew efforts for holding an all-Arab Congress either in riejaz or Iraq.(u) to enaeavour to bring about an alliance between .arub Kings ana rrinces, (e) to ask; Emir saoua to inauce ills lather to open negotiations with France witn a view to tne appointment oi Emir Feisal to the lyrian throne, thus promoting Arab unity ana enabling nationalists in Syria to attain their aspirations ana cooperate with France on tne lines of the policy in Iraq; (1) to re-establish relations between Emir Abuullah anu the Istiqial so lon &amp; as tne former works for nrab independence ana unity; (g) to hold a meeting of Arab leaders either in Jerusalem or in Egypt upon tne first opportunity after tne declaration of war, in order that tnese decisions may be put into execution. It appears that *&gt;rab politicians are anxious that if Italy wages war against Abyssinia ana European powers become involved, they should exploit the situation in order to attain independence, rhcy argue uiiat such an emergency is the only opportunity for them to force the British Government to grant tneir aspirations ana they are careful not to forego the opportunities afforded in tne last world war or to repeat tne mistakes of trie late King Hussein. It is alleges that this was hintea to Emir 3aouu at private conversations.3B No. 1-6 (862/262/9;. HIS Majesty’s Minister.

Hathorn Hall, OFFICER ADMINISTERING THE GOVERNMENT. •TRANSLATION In the name of God the Almighty* At last, everyone knows of the miserable situation in Palestine and of its inhabitants the Moslems since the Great war, and the danger© which surround Palestine since the British Occupation. ith all this, and in view of the dangers, calamities and mis-haps to the inhabitants of this country we find it is our religious duty to call upon our Moslem Brethren, explaining to them in brief, the result of the present situation which is becoming worse day by day, and which foreshadows the worse results, if the Moslems in these countries do not take the necessary steps quickly to ask the help of their brethren in other regions* The British Government conquered Palestine (which is the Southern portion of Syria) and occupied it after the Great War as the French Government occupied the Northern portion of Syria* The inhabitants of Palestine before the days of the British Occupation varied from 660 to 700 thousand* of these about 60 thousand were Jews, 60 thousand Christians and the rest Moslems# In the Turkish reign the Jews had great ambitions to increase their numbers in Palestine and they also had certain religious ambitions in 'Masjid el Aksa rt , as well as political ambition to occupy Palestine which we shall explain further on* Certain Jewish leaders then tried to persuade the ottoman Sultans and the Turkish leading men to aid these ambitions, but they were unsuccessful* When the Great War was declared in 1914» the Turkish Government joined Germany, and the Jewish leaders thought it opportune to realise their hopes and ambitions to occupy Palestine and to make it a Jewish country and build therein a Jewish Kingdom* They approached the British Government and its Allies to whom they rendered \ somesome services and financial support and obtained a promise from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lord Balfour, as follows 'The Government of His Majesty the King, look with favour on the formation of a National Home for the Jews in Palestine and they will do their utmost to secure this, provided that this will not affect the religious and civil rights enjoyed by other communities which are not Jewish who live in Palestine at present, nor the rights or position which the Jews enjoy in other countries'. The Government of Great Britain had promised King Hussein (the then Sharif of Mecca) that if he joined in the Great War they would acknowledge the (Istiqlal) autonomy of the Arab countries and assist the Arabs to form their autonomic Kingdom. They came to an official agreement through their representative in Egypt sir Henry MacMahon. When the War ended in the victory of Great Britain and the Allies, the Jews and Arabs demanded the fulfilment of her promises to them. The Arabs failed to make Great Britain execute her promises but as to the Jews, they made Great Britain carry out her promise to them in the formation of a National Home in Palestine, and she made more than this which is more dangerous. The Jews are ambitious to have more than a National Home, they are anxious to estab lish a Jewish Kingdom in Palestine, to overwhelm this Arab Moslem country, to expel its inhabitants from it, and to re-construct the Temple of Solomon on the ruins of Masjid el Aksa, a thing which will arouse the surprise of the Arabs and Moslems who are scattered in the Moslem realms to a point of non belief, to hear these Jewish ambitions and to what extent they aim against the Moslems in this country and more so in their Holy Places; and that they are working hard to expel the Moslems from Palestine and to reconstructthe Temple of Solomon over the ruins of the Masjid el Akaa. But the facts are as we say* We do not merely say this, we have sufficient and clear proofs; we have illustrations and documents in respect of the Jewish ambitions, we have the words and sayings of their leaders and friends, which they publish in their papers, and books. These proofs are as followsi- v/hen certain Jewish leaders commenced propaganda among the Jews for the return to the land of 2ion (Palestine) and the construction of the Jewish Kingdom therein, they began to negotiate with the Great Powers to help them to realise this ambition, and in view of the difficulties in realising this scheme, the Powers offered to establish their National Home in other regions which are wider than Palestine and richer in soil, such as the Argentine in South America and Uganda in Africa. They were offered the Crimea (in Russia) but the religious ideas of the Jews and national ambitions inspired them to return to Palestine to gather round the (Temple) which was destroyed some two thousand years before, and in which place the Moslems had created the Masjid el Aksa, are the cause of their refusing all other places than Palestine in which to establish their National Home* Ambitions of the Jews to construct the Temple of Solomon over the ruins of Mas^id el Aksa. The proofs of the Jewish ambitions to construct their Temple over the ruins of Masjid el Sakhra el Musharafa (the Holy Rock) in the Masjid el Aksa, and to expel the \rabs from Palestine, and to form their Jewish Kingdom, are more than can be enumerated, but amongst them are the following: (1) The British Encyclopedia, printed in 1926, volumes 27 and 28, page 986 - 987 under the word 'Zionism”:- 'The Jews look for the redemption of Israel and the gatheringgathering of the nation in Palestine, and to re-fora the Jewish Kingdom, to reconstruct the Temple to restore the throne of David in Jerusalem for the second time under a King from the descendants of David etc* , etc* M (2) The Jewish Encyclopedia printed in English under the word M Zionism* and others, are many things which show that the Jews wish to return to Jerusalem in force, to conquer the enemies, to worship the Temple in the Masjid el Aksa and there to establish their Kingdom* (3) The words of one of the Jewish leaders Sir Alfred Mond in 1922 that M The day on which the Temple will be rebuilt is near* I shall dedicate the remaining days of my life to the construction of the Temple of Solomon in place of Masjid el Ak8a M * (4) The words of the Jewish leader Zinkwell - 'The Arabs should pull down their tents and return to the desert whence they came”* Also that which was published in the book of Mr* Bentwich, a Jewish professor, printed in London in 1919 which he called '♦Palestine the Jewish” its past, present and future* In page 103, his reference to the Wailing Wall (Si Biraq) which the Jews call the ailing Wall 'the Jew near the Wailing Wall is more imaginary than the Jew walking in the street* Neither this nor that shall renew the wailing all; but the sons of the coming generation shall take up this and believing that action is the real prayers, they will go to Jerusalem and live in it. They wait the resurrection of a new 'Forish* and a new 'Nahmia” to open the way and return the Holy place to Judaism”* Mr* BentwichMr, Bentwich explained the words (Holy Place) ' The Holy Place is on a Mountain, it is now known as Haram Es Sharif that is el Masjid el Aksa, &gt;f (6) The Jewish newspaper (roar Hayom) circulated in Jerusalem, published in its edition of 18th August, 1929 a speech delivered by Rabbi cook after the violent demonstration by the Jewish youths on 15,8,29 in which he said 'His great interest and happiness in this demonstration forbade him to take hie breakfast after his long fastings. The Jewish youths showed great national zeal and have uplifted the heads of all Jews in the world they proved that they are prepared to sacrifice their lives for their Holy Place (the Temple). (6) The words of Klawzner, a Jewish professor in the Hebrew University on the Mount of olitfes and the leader of a Jewish Society for the protection of the bailing .all which he wrote in the Palestine Weekly on 9.8.29. 'The Palestine Government does not fear the Jews because they do not desire slaughter, they throw no stones, they do not attack the Sheikhs or Moslem women when they go to Masjid el Jkea which is erected on the Sakhra (Rock) which is the Holy of Most Holies which belongs to us' . (7) Of the official documents one which is of great importance was sent by sir L« Boles who was the chief Administrator in Palestine and was sent to the leading authorities on 7th June, 1920 and which read - 'When it is acknowledged that the Minority (the Jews) has no way of ruling the majority (the Arabs) and the lands are not taken by force and when there will be no commercial preference, or inter ference with the religious rights or in the Holy Places,(soBiq '^X oH) benlfllQxa . iM m/c na y/oft ei 31 t : iXp.$.nsJO:^ &amp; ac :;1 so •il4 YXoH orlT* 1 . bod'fiXi/o^lo (mo^sI!

But the attitude of world Jewry since the decision of the Congress of St. Remo, and the appointment of Sir Herbert Samuel, has shown a warning as also the demand of Mr. Uehkin, the vice President of the Zionist Executive supported by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Cook and the Rabbinical Council in the Holy lands in their demand for “ the ,, c laim-at-She c.illMZ.. Tv all which is considered a Jewish property, and the whole area of the Temple inclusive.“ But this place which is known by Hi ram es Sharif comprising the Masjid el Aksa and the Dome of the Rock is worshipped by Moslems being the third Holy Rosque in the World. I forward with this letter of mine, a letter under separate cover which deals with this, but if this claim is published and is known, it would be sufficient at this moment when Moslem feeling is agitated to upset all the Moslem world”. (8) The Jerusalem Grand Mufti received a letter from the Chief Rabbi in Roumania as follows:- “To the Grand Mufti Jerusalem - In the name of the Everlasting God, I, the undersigned, Abraham Rosenbach, the Grand Mufti, residing at Rhartouni, at Treimi Street, No.30, Yokkina, Roumania, asks permission to inform your Eminence of the following King David bought through a contract the Mountain of Morea in Jerusalem from Arnon el Yabousi, and he donated this to the Everlasting God. I have proved this to the Secretary of the Palestine Government under number 36/4R7, Jerusalem. Therefore in the name of the Everlasting G-od I demand: To make the ArabsArabs permit the priests the sons of Aaron in this place where they shall celebrate the religious beliefs, so that the blessings of God asked in that place he heard throughout the world by Radio. After the Arabs permit this and with good intention, they will remain as its watchmen and by this the rights of ownership gained by King David are safe guarded as is mentioned in Isaim 24 - Written on 20th November, 1930, at 1 * hours, being the 28th day of the Jewish month in the year |591* Yours sincerely, (Signed) Abraham Rosenbach./ill these documents are a few of many which we possess and which show the Jewish ambitions to own the Maejid el Aksa and to reconstruct the Temple of -Solomon in its place after taking it from the Moslems. We forward with this memorandum several photographic illustrations which the Jews have secretly printed and distributed all over the world. Ihese show the Masjid el Sakhra el Mosharrafa (the oly Hock) the Jerusalem Mosques, the Mosque of Abraham in Hebron, as well as other Moslem Holy places which the Jews are ambitious to own. They have laid over the Dome of the Holy Rock, the Jewish Crown, the ten commandments and other Jewish b00 *® as wel1 as emblems of their Religion and beliefs as is shown in the illustration. Besides these illustrations we send you herewith other Jewish illustrations showing the Holy Hock and over it the Jewish emblem, the Wailing Wall and other Moslem Holy places which the Jews imagine ' l11 oecome their property when they take from the hand of the Moslems• Amongst these illustrations is the one which represents Theodore Hertzel the great Zionist leader standing facing the Holy filing Well (El Biraq) with a road open for the Jewish mobs towards the Masjid el Aksa; We also send you a copy of an appeal which the Masjid Committee for the protection of the Moslem Religious and ^oly places iformed several years ago for this purpose by certain Moslem notables and learned men in Jerusalem) issued when they saw the danger approaching. We also send you a copy of the report of the Defence Committee of the (Biraq) (Wailing 4all) formed in ; erusalem which contains ’'detailed’’detailed explanation about the Biraq (Wailing Wall) and the Jewish ambition to obtain this Moslem place as well as other Moslem Holy Places in Palestine'* ^ow that we have fully explained the ambitions of the Jews, their religious intention and political desires towards Palestine and the Moslem Holy Places, we are moved to explain the ways and methods ibey adopt to realise these desires which threaten the l^oslems in this country with the greatest of dangers• The Jews in the world number 16 millions but despite their small number they are scattered all over the world especially in the capitals of the European Powers, They have special methods and ways to make money and acquire wealth. This is not what it is intended to explain; but by their economical methods and knowledge of finance they have formed ban s and comznercial associations which control the economical world and have a great effect on world markets. There are many high Jewish houses v/hich give loans to Governments and Political men and from which they gain enormously* The Jews both before and after the Great War formed political societies which worked to acquire an realise their religious desires in J:lestine. These societies which proceed by special rules and regulations gather large sums of money from the Jews of the world. To these amounts are added the contributions made by wealthy Jews and great men in America, Prance and England as well as in other places. TheseThese sums are collected and spent on the purchase of lands in Palestine from which they dispossess the owners, the Arabs, and on these lands they construct the Jewish colonies in which the Jewish immigrants live. The Jewish immigration to Palestine and the dispossession of the lands from its owners, the Arabs, are the main foundations of the Jewish National Home, Since the British Occupation the Zionists have excelled at turning Arab Moslem Palestine into a Jewish land; firstly by immigration from Europe, America and other parts of the world; secondly by taking possession of the land from its poor owners, So much so that they have within a period of 16 years accomplished much which they could not have done had it not been for the disunity of the Moslems in other countries and their great negligence of the Palestine cause, Notwithstanding their small numbers and the great number of Moslems of the world the Jews have succeeded in greatly influencing the British policy, so as to carry out their ambitions in regard to their religious and national desires to Palestine, In the early days of occupation the Jews claimed fulfilment of the Balfour Declaration which says 'The Government of His Britannic Majesty views with favour the formation of a Jewish national Home in Palestine and will do their utmost to secure this; it being clearly understood that nothing will be done which will affect the religious and civil rights which other nations who are living in Palestine besides the Jews enjoy nor the rights of political4 / - 11 - bl political positions which the Jews enjoy in other countries”. This promise the Jews have widely circulated and intend it to mean that Palestine should become a Jewish country with all the full meanings of these two words. What has helped the Jews to confirm that is the inaptitude of the two Arabic and Moslem worlds in face of these calamities which befell the Arabs of Palestine, and the lack of interest from a religious point of view of Moslems and of the Arabs from a national point of view. The Jews have compelled Great Britain to act according to their dictates and to open wide the doors of Palestine for immigrants from all parts of the world especially during the last three years, 1350, 1351, 1352, 1353 which are 1932, 1933, 1934. The Jews numbered 46,000 at the British Occupation they now number 400,000 and every day steamships come to Palestine loaded with hundreds of Jews. Turing the last month alone 6180 Jews came authorised by the Government, excepting those who entered Palestine clandestinely. As to the lands, the Jews have begun to dispossess the Arabs of all means. They were helped in this by the money they have collected for this purpose, the poverty of the citizens, and the heavy taxes imposed on their lands. The area of lands owned by the Jews in Palestine before the war was ( ) and now it is ( ). They sweep over the lands in a dreadful way, and while this is going on one can see villages and fields- 12 - fields of the Arabs and Moslems transformed overnight to Jewish Colonies, after the Inhabitants thereof have been chased as has been the case in Klar^ lb In Anier , VSIadi el Hawareth and others of the lands and. fields which were inhabited by its owners and while the operation of (overwhelming Palestine) ie being carried out by the most dirty way, the British authorities refuse the demand of the people to stop the immigration and the sale of lands* The Jewish ambitions of the SJoelem Holy Placee and dispossession of the Arab lands, the supremacy of Policy and economics over Pileetine, have led to riots and sanguinary disturbances in which much blood and many lives were shed, and alestine has become a den of corruptions by the many Jewish immigrants who come in carrying with them the Bolahevic (communist) principles which are entirely contrary to the Laws of the bhamnedan eligion, and the Jewish Bolahovlcs in Palestine have formed a secret dangerous body which undertakes to spread communist prind ies and which works to make Arabs Bolaherlcs in this Poslem country* ■very time there was a riot or a revolution, the Government appointed comiitteen to investigate the cause and to formulate a scheme which will guarantee the non recurrence of such calamities. The reports of these com. ittees always contained important confessions such as 'The fear of the Arab majority for their future &amp;£s a nation and the attempt of the Jewish minority to rule are the principal reasons which lead to such disturbences'. The last of these comlttees, was that under the supremacy of ir 'Valter r haw' which come to Palestine inin consequence of the year f 30 Hegira or 1929 V/estem calendar. I’his coranittee remained for two months listening to the statements made by witnesses of both parties, Arab and Cews and of foreigners as well and the following is what was reported by this committee to the British Colonial Secretary and the British Parliament in March,1930. On page 125 of the copy (Arabic copy) it is said: ” e have been convinced by the facts which were laid before us, that the complaints which existed for a long time before the Feast of Forgiveness, 1928, helped the outbreak of the riots of August last. It is also our opinion that had it not been for these complaints, the said riots would have not taken place, or had it taken place it would have not actually reached the stage reached now, and to a certain extent we consider the political and economical complaints of the Arabs which have been explained to us during the investigations should be considered primary reasons for the riots of August last”. 127 of the said report tinder Immigration says:- 'It seems clear to us that the Arab position resulted from the combination of fear and anger which caused this danger, and this will result in future riots unless it is shown to them that these fears are mostly exaggerated, or it is proved to them that they are without foundation, and unless they are convinced that they will be protected against the supremacy of other nations or expulsion from their lands”. On-14- ^ 10 On page, 13? under --ration ^ it is said: ( fhe fir&amp;b witnesses claimed that the burden imposed on the tax payer in view of the state we have mentioned is caused by the entry of a great number of immigrants into the country at a time when the country is not ready to take them and in our opinion Sir John Campbell was right in what he said in his report that the crisis of 1927, 1928 resulted from the influx of immigrants who came to the country which were more than the country could absorb* M On^age ,147 of the repoi-t* see that the claims and pretentions sub mitted by the Zionists in regard to the future of the Jewish immigration into the country had to a certain extent given rise to fears in the minds of the Arabs' 1 . Onjpage 211 of the same report under 'Summary of results and comments'. 'This is an evidence which would not be refuted; that the Jewish authorities had infringed the immigration policy; a dangerous departure from the principles accepted by the Zionist Committee in 1922 which says that it is imperative to arrange immigra tion in accordance with the economical capacity of the country to absorb new immigrants'. Similarly, as the country cannot contain these immigrants so is the remaining portion of the land in the hands of the Arabs insufficient for its owners, nd the following is a proof which came in the said report on the question of lands. 'ItM It has been reported in detail how the Marj Ibn Amer lands have been purchased by the Jews, the area of which is more than 800,000 dunums and the number of the agriculturists who have been evicted is 700-800 as per the statement of the Jewish Expert, and 8,730 as per the statement of the Arabic Expert. It was also reported how the Jews bought the lands of Wadi el Hawareth, an area of 30,826 dunums, and how the agriculturists have been sent out by force (the Police) and the bewilderment of the tribe after losing their resiaence”. O n .page 162 of the same report . 'The fourth point and the last, which is the most important, is that the Palestine Government should consider the natural surplus of the actual number of people and the land available when they decide the number of new immigrants who are to be added to the agricultural population, even though methods of modern agriculture are used. The British administration have introduced improved health condition to such an extent that the number of deaths has lessened, and it is expected that due to the increase of births there will be an increase in the population in the next thirty years of 300,000 who will depend upon the land for living if no industries are found in the country'. On the same page it also says. 'A detailed investigation takes a long time, and until this investigation is completed, the Palestine Government may have to repeat the situation now found at Wadi el Haraweth and have to appeal to the Police to chase large numbers of agriculturists who have no other lands to which they can be transferred and settle. PreviouslyCtS) IV 16 . Previously the persons who were sent out of their land used to flock to neighbouring villages and we were told that even though this was possible four or five years ago it is not possible at the present time, as the absorptive capacity of the country has reached its limits. The real truth is that j there is no other land available to settle the I new immigrants on except that taken from the / present citizens’ 1 . On page 166 it is also said; ”V»e think that there is no doubt that the continuation or acceleration of this process means that there will be a large portion of the population discontented and without land. This is a fact full of danger to this country”. /here the report speaks of the 'Arab views on constitution” it explains the following: ”The Arab Nation in Palestine is united in its demand for a representative Government. It is possible that this unity may weaken but it is apt to be renewed when any disturbances take place which affect the public interest, and we believe, that the feelings of disgust amongst the Arabs, which is caused by their continual failure to acquire any portion of self Government, doubles the dangers and complications of the local administration and was a cause that helped the recent riots. It is a factor which should not be Ignored when taking any precautions to avoid the repetition of such disturbances in the future”. Then-17- n Then in the 13th Chapter the report explained the reasons for the riots and the following points in pages 198-199 are of great importance, 'On the other hand the Jewish iranigrants who came to Palestine after the War were more active and superior to the Jewish community in Palestine before the War, The Jewish immigrant is representative of a constructional tody which supports him and which in the opinion of the Arabs has unlimited funds. The Arabs foresee the possibility that later on these competitors will not be satisfied to share the country with them. These fears have become enhanced by the more extreme declarations published about the Zionist Policy and so that Arabs do think that the Jewish immigrant is not only a danger to their living, but they think he is that Lord who shall rule the country in the future. The fear of the Jew as an economical competitor has increased in two ways - (a) the campeign for the struggle for the national home has planted a fear in the minds of the Arabs; (b) Jewish enterprise and the results thereof and the entry of the Jews into the country has confirmed their first fears, and led them to believe that they shall finally be chased from their lands.Then the report discussee the difficulties inherent in the Mandate. It is acknowledged that the difficulties of that pact and the Balfour declara tion are the important factors in the Palestine complications and it referred to the publication of a clear explanation of the policy, confirmed by a declaration from the British Government that she is definitely willing to follow that policy. This will be of great help towards good government in the country. On the same page it is further stated:- M The Arabs in Palestine have a feeling of resentment at the present situation, as they have no means to cooperate directly with His Majesty’s Government, while the Jews in Palestine are permitted to do so directly through the power conferred upon the Zionist committee in the 4th article of the Mandate to cooperate direct with the Government of His Majesty'. After the Colonial Minister submitted the report of the Shaw Enquiry Commission to the British Parliament in March 1930, the British Government took the opinion of the members of the said Commission, and decided to publish a political communique to define clearly its policy in Palestine. This communiqw was put up as a VThite Paper which the Colonial Minister submitted to the British Parliament in Hovember, 1930. This paper was based on the report of the Shaw Commission of Enquiry and the report of Sir John Hope Simpson a British expert on immigration and settlement whom the British Government had delegated to investigate the Palestine complications. In the beginning of this White Paper are found the following passages in respect of the delegation of this British expertexpert and hie duties. 'The report of the Shaw Com dssion of inquiry has drawn attention to certain points of this problem, whicl the Government of His Majesty saw necessitated full and prompt investigation in view of the relation they have to future policy* It was therefore decided to delegate an expert investigator (Sir John Hope Simpson) to discuss with the High Comissioner land settlement, immigration, and economical development, and to report on these to His Majesty’s Government. In view of the importance of these subjects, and their relation one to another, it was recognised by His Majesty’s Government that it is impossible to prepare a statement of policy, before a detailed report on the Palestine situation is prepared which deals with these three subjects and which Sir John Simpson is qualified to furnish. Hi s Majesty’s Government have been repeatedly asked to issue a communique prior to his report, which will declare its future policy, but His Majesty’s Government, though realising the necessity of publication of this communique, find itself compelled to adhere to the decision to wait for the report of Sir John Simpson giving all the points on the difficulty of this problem and the necessity for investigating all facta before arriving at any definite results'. Sir John Simpson presented his report - after minute examination of the raleetine situation, from this report Hoslem-Arab public opinion in Palestine expected that the Government would respect their claims and ideas after perusing these reports of the British experts and Commissions of Enquiries, and that the Government would decide immediately uponupon a policy nearer to justice and impartiality and further from the policy of oppression ufoich was carried on in the past; hut no sooner had the report of the Shaw Commission of Enquiry been published than Jewish political bodies and their societies throughout the world refused to acknowledge it and protested strongly against it, and so also in the case of the report of the British expert Sir John Simpson. No sooner had the White Paper been published which contained the Government policy on the administration of Palestine, than the Jewish Agency and the Zionist Societies protested strongly against this policy threatening all sorts of threats. The Jewish papers and others bought by them began to attack the British Prime Minister Mr. MacDonald and Lord Passfield, the Colonial Minister in a particular form and the British Government in general accusing them of treachery. The Jewish paper Haaretz, the main organ of the Zionist Executive in Palestine published an article in which it asked world Jewry to unite and to extract the fatal poison from the White Paper. All which was written in the Jewish papers all over the world in English, German, French and Hebrew was on this subject. In consequence of this the English papers began to retreat before the attacks of the Jewish papers. The f, Daily News and Chronicle ’ 1 published a leader to the ©fleet that the British Government was very anxious at the way the Jews all over the world declared their animosity and therefore it was willing to publish a fresh communique explaining the contents of the White Paper. At that time, the Arab Executive Committee in ' alestine received a telegran from its secretary JamalJamal Kff. el Husseini, who was then in London to spread propaganda, dated 15th Jamdi el Thour 1349 ( 6 th Movemher, 1930) in which was said that the Zionists were stirring the Jews of the world against the British Government and the White Paper, and that he wa.-. afraid that the result of this campaign would he the retreat of the British Government. The Arah Executive called a meeting on the 8 th November, and decided that the President and members ol he said Executive should interview the High Commissioner drawing his attention to the feelings of the Executive towards the British Government's retreat from its policy as laid down in the White Paper and the new declaration of the Colonial Minister. They handed to His Excellency n telegram in the following text which they wired to the Colonial Minister and the leading English Journals! 'The Palestine Arabs are disquieted by the possibility of the retreat of the British Government in view of the propaganda which the Jews spread against the hite Paper which does not differ from the declarations made by Lord Churchill in 1982, except that the British Government has explained this time her intention to protect the Arabs and to correct the political errors. The retreat of the Government against the Jewish pressure is a good lesson to the Arabs, and, therefore, to avoid all apprehension which has increased in the minds of the Arabs from this false Jewish propaganda, the Arab Executive begs the BritishBritish Government to publish a communique which would do away with this apprehension and which would put an end to the Jewish tumults* (Signed) Moussa Kazim el Husseini. President of the Arab Execu - 4 ive* That which the Arabs feared would happen had actually taken place; for, notwithstanding the White Paper not securing a thing for the Arabs, political demands, and despite the fact that its contents were the desire of the British Government to amend its political errors and to follow a policy nearer to justice and partiality particularly in the case of immigration and lands, the British Government was compelled to adhere to the organised demands of the Jewish Societies, and the Prime Minister, Mr# McDonald, was compelled to send a letter to Pr# Veizman, the Zionist leader explaining the contents of the White Paper as being favourable to the Zionists.Mr. MacDonald published thie letter in London ana in Palestine on li.2#31., that is four months after the publication of the white paper, so that the Zionists had. succeeded in their efforts in this short period and compelled the British Government to refrain from its desires and to divert its policy to a form which is contrary to the realities. In order to express essential facts we hereunder narrate certain contents of the white paper, and after these we shall narrate the contents of the explanatory letter which plainly contradicted the contents of the white paper so that it may be possible to draw a comparison and get the required result. Ih-Section g of the white paper it is saifli 'In this case, it should be definitely understood that it is useless for the Jewish leaders on the one side, to demand of His Haje 8 ty f s Government to carry out its policy in connection with the immigration and lands for example in accordance with the desires of the different sects of the Zionist public opinion which is tne most stubborn, for by carrying out this, there is a complete ignoring of the duty required of the Mandatory Power towards the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, anc that duty is not of less importance. it is also useless from the other side for the Arab leaders to insist upon their demands to legislate a form of constitution to compel His Majesty’s Govern ment to secure the two points referred to above, which is impossible. His Majesty’s Government think that the reasons which led to the strain and anxiety between the two parties, is the forlorn hope which advisers have circulated(§&gt; circulated that efforts to frighten His M:jesty’s Government and oppress it will result in the end in it being compelled to follow a policy which is in favour of one side”. In Section (15) of the said paper it is said:- ”It is definitely possible to say at present that owing to the present means of agriculture adopted by the Arabs there are no lands in Palestine available for the settlement of the new immigrants except the different lands owned by the Jewish Executive. In the past severe comments were made in respect of the small area of 'miri” lands which have been laid out under the management of the Jewish /agriculturists. 't is a mistake to think that the Palestine Government own large areas of vacant land which it is possible to hand over to the Jews to develop, as these vacant lands owned by Government should not be considered. The Government claims large areas of land which are being actually made use of and ploughed and even though the ownership of these lands be considered to be that of Government, yet this ownership is disputed in many places, and it is not possible to put these under the management of the Jews to settle as they are being cultivated by Arab agriculturists. To find other lands for the Arab Agriculturists who have lost their land, to live upon is worse than finding the land for the Jewish colonisers, as this depends upon the development of the land which is now being worked.” In Section (16) of the said paper it is said: - ”It is seen from available reports, that the area of cultivable lands in Palestine, the Beersheba Zone isis excluded, is 6,544,000 dunums* These areas are much less than previous estimates in which it is calculated, according to official estimates, as 'between ten and eleven million dunums. While a family need of 130 dunums of land to live upon in a decent manner in the lands not irrigated, we find that if the available land in Palestine is divided (the lands in the hands of the Jews being excluded) amongst the present Arab cultiva tors, each family would have 90 dunums; and in order to be able to give each family of Arab cultivators 130 dunums of the land which is the standard, eight million dunums of cultivable lands are required; it is also been that amongst ’he Arab rural families which number 36, '30 families, there are 29.14' without lands, the number of families who ploughed and lost the lands before is not known. This is a point amongst others which it is not possible to ascertain, but it can possibly be ascertained by the census which will take place next year”. In Section (17) of the paper it is saids- f The state of the Arab Fellah requires much attention, and it is imperative to lay down a special policy foi land development to assist them. The inhabitants o \ the Jewish Colonies have every advantage which can be gained from Jewish funds, education, and organisation and it is to the credit of these colonists that these benefits have been used. But on the other hand when the Arab inhabitants are given these benefits which the Jewish colonists enjoy, they are bound to increase by the excess of births over deaths, while the lands upon which they live have decreased by one million dunums which have passed to the hands of the Jews'. InSection 18 it Is also said;- w The means 'by which the Jewish 'bodies claim that the results of colonisation were beneficial to their neighbours the Arabs refer to the colonies formed by the Pica Society before the colonisation was financed from the Palestine funds which is now the instrument of the Jewish Executive* The attempts that were made to confirm that the Zionist colonisation did not cause tenants of lands bought to join the section who own no lands has been proved to be unconvincing if not misleading.” In Section (80) it is said:- 'The Jewish leaders were very frame as to their policy and the Jewish Executive of the .Jewish labourers which has a great prestige in the Zionist policy has claimed that these restrictions were very necessary to secure the entry of the greatest possible number of Jewish immigrants, and to protect the living of the Jewish labourers so as not to lower it to the standard of that of the Arab labourer. No matter how logical were these pretensions from a definite national movement, it is necessary to say that they are not in conformity with the rulings of the 6 th Article of the Mandate which clearly demands of the Palestine G-overnraent that though facilit? ting the Jewish immigration and the settlement of the Jews in great number in the country there will be no infringement or prejudice to the rights of the other communities.' In Section (26) it is said in relation to inriigrati on: 'This investigation has revealed certain weaknesses in the present regulations, it has also proved that according to this regulation, many persons have entered who should not have had a visa on their passports, if all details —© 83 Oi r details in their respect were known* The Government does not administer active control on the irmigrants; this is shown hy the non-existence of precautions against the irregular issue of immigra tion certificates, and of the entry of undesirables. There is also a great number of travellers who enter the country as visitors for a limited period, and who remain in the country without permission. The number of those who entered in this way during the last three years is about 7,300 persons; in addition there is a great number who enter the country by evading the controlled boundaries. -dvery effort on the part of the Government to control immigration should be considered, especially the role played at present by the Jewish Labour Committee in relation to Jewish Immigration. The prestige of this committee is wide, and its deeds are manifold; it is an inrportant factor within the Zionist world movement. In the congress held at Zurich more than a quarter of the members who repres ented the Zionists whether in Palestine or abroad, were of those who belong to this association.” In Section_27 it is said on the same subiect:- r Aa to the relation of unemployment with immigration, there are many difficulties at present in view of the lack of sufficient means by which it is £&gt;ossible to estimate unemployment at any time. This is particularly true in relation to the Arabs, in view of the lack of statistics which could be depended upon, yet sufficient evidence existed to prove that unemployment amongst the Arabs had reached a dangerous limit, and that unemployment amongst the Jev/sJews was also an unsatisfactory feature* It may 'be said that it has been clearly proved that the preparation of the Labour Schedule should be decided upon when the number of unemployed in Palestine had been ascertained and confirmed, and His Majesty’s Government must carefully study a way to find a plan for this purpose.' In Section 28 of the same subject it is said:- 'The sixth article of the Mandate dictates that the rights of the other communities should not be prejudiced by Jewish immigration. It is clear that if Jewish immigration causes the loss of the necessary work on which the Arabs make their living, and if the state of Jewish unemployment tends to affect all the labourers in general, the Mandatory -ower should, in conformity with the Mandate, lessen or stop immigration, until the unemployed of the other party are given work. It is, therefore, observed in this connection, that His Majesty’s Government consider (by the investigations made in regard to immigration and unemployment) that the stoppage of immigration of labourers for the month of May last, was completely justified. It was claimed that the approval of the High Commissioner for the issue of immigration certificates as per the schedule of labourers, meant that there was room for immigrants of the class of labourers, and that His Majesty’s Government had been influenced by political considerations when she decided to stop the issue of these certificates. But this was not so, for when His Majesty’s Government decided to stop the issue of these certificates, she had in mind the opinions expressed in the report of the Shaw Commission of Enquiry that there was not enough land. andand that immigration should he strictly controlled. It has been realised that such matters should be investigated by an expert, but His Majesty’s Government felt that until such investigation had been carried out, no steps should be taken which might aggravate an economic situation which was the cause of anxiety in the opinion of the majority of the members of the Shaw Commission. Any decision taken for the entry of Jewish immigrants without considering these findings should be discouraged, not only from the point of view of the interest of Palestine in general, but in view of the interests of the Jewish Community also. So long as suspicion exists among the Arabs, (and this is undoubtedly so) that the economic crisis which they are now suffering is due to excessive Jewish immigration, and so long as there are reasons which may clearly prove that this fear is well founded, there can be little hope of improving the relations between the two nations. But it is on such improvement that the peace and prosperity of Palestine must depend in the future. In Section 29 w hich the fifth and the last of the White Paper it says:- n It seems from the situation discovered by a thorough investigation of the economical, political and communal factors, that Palestine is confronted by difficult circunistances in its development and it may be said that in the past Government has left the economical and communal forces to do their work without interference on her part. It is clear that it is impossible to continue this policy w . This section also contained the following;-'It is necessary that the two parties should agree to live together, and that each race should respect the necessities ancl demands of the other, therefore, Kis Majesty’s Government appeal to the Arabs to realise the situation and to do their utmost to reach to a state of prosperity for all. His Majesty’s Government also demands of the Jewish leaders to acknowledge the necessity of conceding certain points vhich have begun to rise in certain quarters in connection with the Jewish National Home.” Now that we have narrated certain passages of the White Paper, and certain passages of the report of the Shaw Commission of Enquiry which show to what extent the Arabs are oppressed in this country and how the authorities have dispossessed them of their lands, so that 30$ of the families who live on agriculture are without lands, and scattered, and the streams of the Jewish immigrants have caused a great danger to the country, and after the British Government, by the White i-aper, had shown its intention to amend its policy and to adjust partly its plans, we will narrate hereunder passages taken from the letter of Mr. McDonald to Dr, Weiman which are contradictory to the white paper. These passages show surrender to Jewish demands and permits them to increase immigration and appropriation of lands, after the British Govern ment was about to restrict this, We mention these passages, to show the influence ol Jews in British political circles, an influence which caused her to cancel to-day that v/hich she had executed yesterday. the iollov/ing is that which was contained in Mr McDonald’sMcDonald’s letter:-. Downing Street, No:10. Dear Dr. Weizman, ^ ishing to remove the misunderstandings in resj ect of the policy of* His Majesty’s Grovernment in Polestine, which has been confirmed in the White Paper published in October, 1930, and which has been the subject of discussion in the House of Commons on the 17th November, 1930, and wishing to refute certain remarks by the Jewish Executive in regard to the White Paper, I am pleased to send you the follow ing statement in respect of His Majesty’s Government’s position which I consider an explanation of the white paper on the subjects mentioned in this letter.” In Section 5 of the said letter it is said* 'Many comments were made on this paper which many aver contains prejudicial allegations against the rights of the Jewish Nation and the Jewish labour committees. His Majesty’s Government strongly deny that this is meant. It is acknowledged that the Jewish Agency has always cooperated with good will to execute the policy of the Mandate, and that the works undertaken by the Jewish nation in Palestine have had ueneficial results in the development of the country. His Majesty’s Government also acknowledges the valuable services that the labour committees, and the labourers render to Palestine and wishes to encourage them in every way.' 10 . of the said communique it said:- His Majesty’s Government wishes shortly to investigate the question of the 'Miri* lands and others that are available or that could be madeavailable to settle the Jews on in reference to the obligation of the Mandatory Government in the sixth article of the Mandate# This investigation will be thorough and it will deal with land in Palestine# While this investigation is being carried out, necessary facilities v/ill be given to enable all concerned Jews and Arabs to present all claims and evidence they wish”# In lection 15 of the said communiQue it is said: 'Over and above this it is not intended by the policy of His Majesty’s Government to prevent any Jews acquiring surplus lands; and the paper does not contain this prohibition nor is it intended to include this# All that the paper means is a temporary control on land transactions and their transfer, in such a manner as will not be prejudicial to the scheme for land development. His Majesty’s Government feel compelled to say that it is the only Government amongst those responsible for the administration of Palestine which has declared its wish to introduce in Palestine an active policy which it is believed will be beneficial to both Arabs and Jews'. In ectlon 14 of the communique it is said: 'The control of Immigration has some connection with this, and it should be made clear from the begin— ling that this control is not in any way a change in the previous policy and since 1920 when the original immigration ordinance came into being Government has published from time to time, orders to prevent illegal immigration and to facilitate legal immigrationfl In Section 15 it says; 'It may seem that His Majesty’s Government has intended to restrict the entry of other immigrants so long as their entry might cause unempi oyment of Ara * 8 . TheThe Government of Hie Majesty the King does not propose to follow this policy and has already said that in the organisation of the Jewish immigration the following principles should he adopted i.e. is necessary to assure that the immigrants should not be a burden on the citizens of Palestine on the whole and that these should not deprive any section of the present citizens from working. (The white paper for the year 1922)'. In Section 16 it is said: 'His Majesty’s Government do not intend to stop nor to restrict Jewish immigration of any class. The old system will continue from the point of view of approving the schedule of labourers. It will consider in each case the necessity of labourers for the works which depend on Jewish funds or constructed by the majority of Jewish capital end which are not commenced unless there are Jewish labourers. As to works which are financed by the Treasury, the clainsof the Jewish labourers to gain a portion of these in respect of the payments of taxes paid by Jews to the Treasury will be taken into account. As to other works the factors which have relation to the demand of labourers will be considered every time and amongst these will be the unemployment of Jews and Arabs* The immigrants for whom there is work other than casual will not be refused entry into the country on the grounds that the work available cannot be guaranteed for a fixed period'. In Section 17 it Is said: 'As to imnigration schedules at any time, the policy of the Jew sh Agency that in all the schemes and works which are undertaken or encouraged by the Jewish Agency, the Jews should principally be given the work should*9 po should be considered. His Majesty’s Government will not challenge in any way the right of the Jewish Agency by laying down this policy or supporting the principle of preferring the Jewish labourers by the Jewish Coimnittees, or to give works to the Jewish labourers as a right and principle which the Jewish Agency should support”. These official passages taken from the reports of Commissions of Knquiry and responsible departments of the British Government will prove to you how the Jews, who are a minority scattered all over the vorld and whose number does not exceed some ten million, were able to influence the British Government to a great extent and were able to get them to cancel all promises, while the Arab reports and their committees and experts were neglected. If the Jews, who are a minority, are able to influence the British Government to this extent and lead the British policy in the direction they wish and are able to compel the British Government to give up the Moslem religious and political rights for their satisfaction, it is not then strange and astonishing if the Arabs who are over 60 millions and the Moslems who are 400 millions are not able to influence British policy. The Arabs and Moslems did not benefit by the Geographical position of their country nor of their number, and therefore, they are not able to influence British policy as the Jews have done, who a are scattered nation with no Government and racial relations except that they are ambitious to get the Moslem Holy Places in Palestine. The% The Jews were able to concert one opinion well organised. They were able to rule the British Policy in the Palestine cause, they were able to cancel the White P;per while the Moslems did not have a yrablie opinion through the force and terror of which they are able to protect i alestine the Holy, which is the first of shrines and the third Holy Mosque against the dangers which threaten. As the Moslem world was quiet through seeing the dangers threatening this Holy country the Politicians of the West saw this quietness and executed the desires of the Zionists to apply their scheme to its widest views. There is nothing that prevents them doing this, so long as the Moslems act as if the case does not concern them and as if the Zionists are not doing their utmost to efface the name of the Moslem Priestine from the map of the Moslem World. Oh! Moslems. Remember that the country of Andalusia was for ages the glory of Moslem civilisation, and that the shade of Islam faded from it when they were separated and divided amongst themselves not assisting each other, and remember that Palestine in its present situation is a second Andalusia repeating its sorrowful scenes while you are watching and when not one of you had stretched his hand to save this Holy country nor uttered a word to encourage its people in their fatal struggle. Remember the sacred blood of the Moslems and their Holy spirits which they sacrificed for this Holy country from to the reign of Saladin the Ayyoubide and from that age to this day. Remember the religious, Historical and Holy importance this country has, and that Jerusalem is the first shrine to the Moslems, and that in it is the thirdthird Holy Mosque (El Maejid el Aksa) to which our Holy Prophet marched. This Holy Country, and the venerable Maejid el Aksa are now threatened with the worst of dangers, and the duty of the Moslems is to unite for the benefit of their religion and being. Remember ris Holy saying 'The believers are brothers'; and His saying 'The believers in their unity are like a body that looses one of its members and the other members unite to keep that body'; and His saying 'He who does not care for the welfare of Moslems is not. of them' and His saying 'The believer to the Believer is like one structure'. Each supports the other'* The duty of every Moslem who is a believer in God and his disciples is to help his Moslem brethren in Palestine who are faithful in their struggle, and patient in their tortures, Seex. to please God, and help to increase the respect of Islam in his first shrine. OhI Moslems. ibA. .oslems of Palestine are only guardians of the Holy Land and watchman over it, but the owners thereof are the Moslems all over the world on whom shall fall the pain of its loss, and the extinguishing thereof the light of Islam* Be it known to you that calamity is not only that of Palestine, but is the calamity of all Islams, and that the danger that threatens Palestine now threatens also the Arabian Peninsula especially Hedjaz the grotto of Islam, the source of his life air the loving hearts of all Moslems, The loss of Palestine0 ^ PeleBtine and MasJid el Aksa, and the quietness and negligence of the Moslems in this great calamity encourages the iiropean Powers to swallow the rest of the Hosier countries* Oh! Moslems - We describe to you the present situation in Palestine this Moslem country which interests you, not to arouse your feelings, but to inform you of the dreadful stage at which it has arrived so that you will help the Moslems of Palestine and share with them this treasure which they have carried for thirteen centuries and to which they were faithful for a long time* The cup is full to the brim so that the religious duty compels every Moslem individually and all the Moslem Governments and bodies collectively to do their utmost to save this Moslem country from danger before it is too late* number and the geographical position of their country are able to influence to a great extent the world policy and they should do so in their own interest* They can by an organised idea became feared and respected and are able to do this without drawing arms or declaring war but by peaceful means influence to a great extent every Kingdom. Any that does not resj^ect their words, nor help them they can punish by an economical boycott which is the best weapon. The internal problems of the European powers and their disputes compel them to take great heed of the Moslems. Why then, should not the Moslems profit by their great numbers and their force which is great and important. The Moslems in the world, by their great OhOhl Moslems - At the outbreak of the Great War when the Ottoman Government took the side of the Germans against the Allies who were in a great need of the aid of the Moslems, the British Government for her part and on behalf of 1 er Allies gave an official declaration to the Moslems of the world that the Moslem Lands shall not be touched and that the Hoslems shall be assured of their future; but these affirmations especially those in relation to Palestine have proved that they are not based in concrete facts, and the sanctuaries and Holy Places of the Moslems are suffering great dangers. Therefore, any new affirmation is not sufficient to safeguard the future of Islaras in Palestine, their lives and their right. This is not sufficient unless the Moslems of the world prove to British their desire and their intention to keep Palestine an Arabic and Moslem country and that no permission be granted to Jews or others to step upon the skull of Moslems in this oly Land. The Jewish five years* Scheme. OhJ Moslems. Did you hear the news of this dreadful scheme which the Zionist Jews called 'the five years scheme' and through which they are trying to overwhelm Palestine within five years. If you have the news of thi; dreadful scheme, what have you done to op; oee it and stop its execution? and if you have not heard of it, we will tell it to you: After that the fews have become one third of the Arab population in alestine and after they own one million dunums of land out of six. millions and o half of the cultivable lands, anc after t ey have seen% cf$ seen that the victory is for then after some ten years and especially during the last three or four years, they felt ambitious and began to think, of laying a scheme which implies greater efforts to occupy the Palestine lands. They will do this by throwing into Palestine within the next five years csome millions of Jewish immigrants from Germany, Middle and East of Euroi&gt;e, and from other regions of Asia, America and South Africa and they will spend during these years millions of pou.de to purchase the remaining portion of the lands now in the hands of the Arabs. The Journal called Finer Journal published in Austria has referred to this scheme. Another proof has been put before us last month which show that the Jews are doing their best to realise this scheme in that a delegation composed of Ben Gurion, leader of the Jewish Labour Party, and other Jewish leaders visited in September last Emir Shakib Arslan and Ihsan Bey el Jabri who composed the Syrian delegation in Geneva and spoke to them in connection with Palestine. They said that the Jews were working and intend to appropriate Palestine and that six million Jews shall enter it very soon whether the Arabs accept or refuse. The said Jewish delegates asked these two to force the Arabt to accept that scheme and to surrender thereto in return for financial help which the Jews will give. Oh I Moslems.

Moslem Supreme Council# Jerusalem* Telegraphic Address* 517* Telephone: 377 and 378. In tfie name of Qod the Merciful. God, the Almighty ordained for the Moslems their religion and urged them to cooperate together and to he brethren* He said in the Koran M Cooperate for good and virtue and not for sin and aggression”, and He also said \ ’’The Believers are Brethren”. His great prophet said ,f The relations of the believers to each other is like the body — if an organ is ailing the rest of the body becomes feverish”. He also said ’’The Believer to the Believer is like a structure, each part is supporting the other*. In obedience to the words of God and His Prophet and in consideration of the grave situation of the Moslems in this Arab Moslem Country (Palestine) which contains the first of the two Kublas and the third Holy shrine, which the Mosque of Aksa, the surroundings of which have been blessed by God when He said in the Koran ”Glory to God who took this Servant, by night, from the Mosque Haram to the Mosque of Aksa, the surroundings of which We have blessed*, it has become necessary to appeal to you exposing the true situation, the bare facts and the great danger which has befallen this sacred and blessed Moslem country, and to make the cries for help of the Moslems in Palestine reach your ears and those of your brethren Moslems Who are under your rule. In order to attain the object of submitting this letter to you and in order to make it easy for you to study(iCM [aO the situation, we considered it necessary to enclose with this letter a memorandum which describes, as far as possible, the bad situation of this Moslem country and the great danger that threatens the future of Islam and the Moslems in this country* It, also, states how the colonizing and the Jewish forces are jointly working for taking it from the hands of the Moslems and turning it into a Jewish country (God forbid) morally and materially and are removing from it every Moslem tint, also ejecting the inhabitants and making them scatter all over the world* The Moslems in Palestine for the last seventeen years and up till now have been and still are struggling to safeguard the sacred Moslem Places and to repulse the foreign as well as the Jewish people who covet them and will keep up their struggle to their last breath* In their capacity as trustees and faithful guards of these Sacred and Holy places they find it their duty, now that the danger is becoming greater and now that the enemy forces, which are equipped with science, money, cunning and arms, are increasing, to appeal to their brethren the Moslems in other countries and to expose to them the true situation and frankly tell them that Palestine which contains the Mosque of Aksa, the Dome of the Rock, the Burraq and the Tombs of the Martyrs and the companions of the Prophet, is about to fall a victim of prey to the enemy* The Moslems who are in everj part of the world and who number about four hundred millions, should open their eyes to the double danger which emanates from colonization and the Jews and which is surrounding the first Kubla and the third Mosque, and to hasten to save this sacred spot from the hands of the enemies of Islam* The slumber of the Moslems, their non-cooperation and their non unity have encouraged the enemies of Islam to Increase their coveting in the annihilation of Islam and in possessing the Moslem country.The Jews covet the whole of Palestine and wish to ;;iake it a Jewish state. Thejwish to take the Mosque of &gt;csa from Moslem hands and to destroy the Dome of the Hock in order to establish on the ruins thereof a new Temple to ( replace the old one which was destroyed* and not a stone * left of it, two thousand years ago. They are determined to attain their aim and are carrying out this determination with all their might. They succeeded so far in possessing about a quarter of Palestine and their number is half that of the Arab population. At the beginning of the Occupation their number was only one fifteenth of the whole population. They have made a programme for the complete Judaisation of Palestine within thensxt five years. If the Moslems do not hasten to resist these aims, and if they do not stand against this Zionist torrent which is sweeping every - * thing before it and the way of which is being prepared by the colonizing policy, all events shew that the fate of the Arab Moslem Palestine will be similar to that of Arab Abd&amp;lusJLa, the lost Moslem Paradise and which was lost owing to the neglect of the Moslems and their non cooperation and their non-unity against the enemies. We do not say this for the sake of stirring up the feelings * of the Moslems to make them enthusiastic, but we say it because it is the sad painful fact and because of our great apprehension for the fate of Islam in a spot considered among the most honourable sacred spots of Islam. We appeal to you in the name of God and Islam to hasten to the help of your patient brethren in Palestine who are struggling for the sake of God by their money and their souls and who are requesting aid and help in order to safeguard the eternal inheritance of Islamkn this country. A day may come in which every assistance and aid/ aid will be of no avail and the Moslems will repent their negligenoe to carry out their duty towards God. We believe that martyred Palestine will have fron your religious enthusiasm and your Islamic zeal a great effective means with the British Government* in the names of the Moslems* to cause it to refrain from this ( oppressing Zionist colonizing policy which is being observed in Palestine and which is detrimental to Islam and which is Judaising this sacred Moslem country, and to compel this policy to respect the wish of the Moslems* and to refrain from slighting four hundred million Moslems whose creed is being attacked and their sacred places being violated in order to give satisfaction to I an unjust body of Zionists who are raising fanaticism in the heart of world Jewry and enticing them to possess Palestine and to rebuild, on the ruins of the Dome of the Rock, Solomon’s Temple.

Extract from Periodical Appreciation Summary No.5/35 dated 13th February, 1935. Pan-Islamic Agitation . 1 . There are indications that the agitation on religious lines as a result of the Ulamas Conference will intensify and that individual action such as warnings on the part of Ulamas is quite possible. Copies of pamphlets endeavouring to show Jewish ambitions towards the Mosque of Aksa, and danger to the Islamic faith from the Zionist movement have been secretly distributed. Humours are circulated, that the Jews have asked that the Mosque should be ceded to them. Together with this are the renewed pan-Islamic campaign (led by M A1 Jamia al Islamia') and the intentior to send delegations to Hejaz to spread propaganda among Moslems respective countries. One of these delegations has been detailed by the newly established National Defence Party, under Ragheb Bey Nashashibi, to be headed by Sheikh Sleiman el Taji, a pan-Islamic firebrand. Three members of this delegation have already set out for the Hejaz. Taher el Fitiani, an emissary of Haj Amin Husseini has also left for Hejaz; he may not be aiming so much at spreading propaganda amongst the pilgrims as counteracting the activities of the delegation of the Nashashibis. Literature, such as the pamphlets alluded to above, and the M fatwas H issued, may be distributed in He t; az by these delegates. The intention of the 'young men' to convoke a general assembly and incidents such as that of Arab Zubeidat (although the effort to exploit it has so far failed) will help this agitation. The followers of Haj Amin Husseini claim that this religious campaign is noticeable and that land brokers are now careful to undertake their transactions secretly. Particulars/Particulars of intending sellers and of land broke' s ?re ■being collected throughout the country and in most individual cases the persons concerned were sent for by the Mufti and either remonstrated with, or made to take an oath on the Koran (it is even alleged, an oath for divorce). Temptation is, however, often too strong to dissuade certain land brokers, especially in places like Jaffa, where Arabs, particularly the Moslems, have considerably enriched themselves from land sales.P.z. 850/35.

It is probable that political activity will increase after the Eid el Pitr, but if the Municipal elections in Jerusalem are annulled by the Court efforts will again be concentrated on party politics. The decisi ons of the Arab Executive Committee have not been executed, but it is probable that propaganda in favour of Palestine will be conducted during the pilgrimage season in Hejaz. Sheikh Sleiman el Taji may be asked to visit the Hejaz by the Young Uen’s Congress for this purpose. The visit to Hejaz of Maulvi Mohd. Haim of India who is known for his work on behalf of the Palestine Arabs is also Although the national Defence Party has now been officially constituted, it has failed to snow any activity. The Mufti’s supporters are still engaged in thepreliminary arrangements for the organisation of their party.

I am directed hy the High Commissioner to refer to your confidential letter No.D.6226-N/33 of the 10th January 1934, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Besident at Hyderabad regarding the proposal by His Highness the Nizam to contribute an amount of one lakh of rupees towards the maintenance of the proposed Moslem University in Palestine, and to inform you that this proposal has been referred to the President of the Supreme^ Moslem Council who gratefully accepts the most generous offer which His Highness has made. 2. The President of the Supreme Moslem Council suggests that the proposed contribution should be used for the purchase of about 1,500 dunams of land in Zeita village in the Tulkarm sub-district, at an estimated cost prj.ce of £P. 6 per dunam including ^ .* expenses. A dunam is approximately 1,000 square metres. In the opinion of the Supreme Moslem Council this land is one of the best lands in Palestine for orange growing. It is masha'a, i.e. undivided land which can be purchased from the villagers. The estimated vlaue of a dunam in the neighbourhood at present is about £p. 20 , and the low price which is proposed for the purchase of the property under reference is obtainable only because the purchase will be made by the Wa(if, and the Waq.f will rent it to its present cultivators* The Supreme Moslem Council anticipate a rise in price should purchase be delayed. It/It would therefore he of advantage If the land could he purchased as soon as possible. 3. The Palestine Director of Lands considers that the price of £P. 5 per dunam is cheap provided that on partition the land purchased with the contribution can he formed into a compact block of orange growing land. The Supreme Moslem Council estimate that the rent obtainable from this Jand whilst planted with melons may fairly be assessed at 2 shillings per dunam; when it is turned into orange groves the estimated rent will be 260 mils per dunam for the first nine years and thereafter £P. 1.250 mils per dunam. 4. I am to enclose a copy of a draft Waafiyeh which has been prepared by the President of the Supreme Moslem Council for transmission to the Nizam*s Government for His Highness* consideration. It will be observed that the latter part of this ^aqfiyeh does not give effect to the intention expressed in the enclosure to your letter inasmuch as it makes no provision for the expenditure of the income from the Nizam's £lft on any other charitable purpose or for the withholding of the income. 5.

In compliance with His Highness* wish and in order to establish jofe his benevolent deed and to ensure permanent revenue which would guarantee the continuance of the project, the permanent office of the General Moslem Congress bought with the above mentioned monies a farm in Palestine, situated in Zeita village, Tulkarm Sub- District, Palestine, the area of which is about 1500 dunams and the boundaries of which are Waq.f lands at Ze i ta • This land would thereafter be called the Nizamiyeh Uthmaniyeh after His Highness* name, and he would declare that he has made this farm a Sahih Waqf for the University of Masjed Al Aqsa, Jerusalem.

A report received by the Nablus agitators to the effect that Moslem girls in a Protestant school in Nablus were asked to attend church on Sunday caused some feeling in Nablus which soon subsided.

TTl ug XLJ&amp;JZLIMjJl » Kftj Amin Hufiseinl has attributed the incomplete success of his mission to India to the following causes: (a) Alleged obstruction oy His : ajesty f 8 Government. He believes that the obstruction of the Government of India has been so great that the Viceroy has written to one of the Government Commissioners in an Indian province, who notified the local Hawab, that the success of the Islamic Congress was detrimental to the interests of Great Britain. One of the Indian princes refused to grant an Interview to Haj Amin unless it was through the British representative and when this was done, a letter of recommendation which Eaj Amin presented was handed over to the British representa tive. ^he Msam of Hyderabad who was expected to contribute one million rupees, did not offer more than 300 thousand rupees and this was after he had met the British represen tative and on condition that the money be sent through the British Government. Similarly Taher Seif el Pin, under influence of a British representative, did not contribute more than 15,000 rupees while he was expected to contribute half a million. (b) The opposition of Sh&amp;wfcat All, whose attitude towards Haj Amin is known. Haj AmIn was compelled to see £rs. Mohammed All and remonstrated with her for the attitude of Bhawkat All, saying: '’Is this the recompense of Palestine for ail it has done in honour of ; ©hammed Ali? rt All members of the family are reported to have blamed Shawkat All who was forced to change his attitude, but it was then too late. (c) Zionist propaganda through the English press._ — — — ^ M T k (4) The financial crisis- It is not expected that more than 80 thousand pounds ^ can be raised in India. In Iraq about 7 thousand pounds have been raised and in view of the death of Fcis&amp;l it is not expected that any progress can be Bade in Iraq. 13iere was a great differ ence in Iraq in the pro-Arab attitude before and after the death of Feisal; the new king lacks the personality which I his father had and is solely concerned in the affairs of Iraq. Eaj Amin, however, is reported to have discussed with Hashimi and Hurl el 3aid the question of amalgamation of Palestine and Trans-Jordan with Iraq, they being under one Mandate and having common commercial interests, l.e., the Iraq railway and the Iraq petrol line. They promised I to assist in this as far as is possible. It is reported that H&amp;j Amin, having witnessed the obstruction of his mission to India by Great Britain does not depend on a policy of friendship of His Majesty’s Government in so far as the Palestine case is concerned and he agrees with the leaders of the &amp;xecutive who declared their distrust and disappointment in the Govern ment. He believes that effort* should be wholly directed towards (a) immigration; (b) saie of lands; all money collected will be dedicated to this purpose, and (c) the boycott of foreign goods which should be properly organised. t+sf * j Jjj 1 ■ Despite all efforts made it has not been possible to ascertain the attitude of H&amp;j Amin towards the present policy of demonstrations in future. He has made no indications and expressed no opinion. He may still be studying the position# but it can be safely stated that the activities of Jamal el Husseinl, whose role in this policy is well known, cannot be without the consent of the Mufti and that the present delegates to the Moslem Supreme Council on the occasion of the return of the Mufti from India and the Mufti’s elslt to rural areas cannot be void of politics. &gt; r»„ or fvjt 'hj-S£ji£L» pm ^ 672 No* D.6226-^/33* From The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Tour Excellency, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter from the Hon'&amp;ie the Resident at Hyderabad No* 1663*0*, dated the 16th December 1933, with enclosure, and to request that the Government of India may kindly be favoured with Your Excellenoy f 8 views on the proposal* I have the honour to be, Tour Excellency v s most obedient servant, Sd/- W.K.

It is not expected that more than f'-V one hundred thousand pounds can he raised at the most. The incomplete success of the mission has been attributed by the Arab leaders mainly to obstruction of the mission by His Majesty's Government, the opposition of Shawkat Ali for well-known reasons, the present financial crisis and Zionist propaganda spread mainly through the English press. Although Haj Amin visited Persia and Afghanistan, where committees have been promised to be formed, it does not appear that he has achieved in either country any tangible success, while his efforts in Iraq were impeded by the death of Feisal. It is, however, believed by the Arabs that the moral effect of the visit paid to India is greater than the material benefit and that Indian Moslems have shown increased sympathy by recent acts of protest and that this is what is required to bring pressure on the British Government.QocrCrme t ° : Foritiau^.ht ( J .Z. fx^ i if « 3o ■ q ■ 33 iM ^ Bt-t^es, - General* It has haen reported triat His Hniinenoe the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem collected H3.2f750/- from Rs»300/- from the Ohief of Manawadar for the for the fortnight ending the 15th September 1933).

It is believed in Arab circles that the mission of the Wafd was obstructed by the Jews and by the British Government, but news from the delegation gives reason for hope and, for this reason, Haj Amin Husseim #vv^/ Xu, ^Polxce, Atix^dauad, olriows that a party of 26 persona, most* ly belonging to this Agency, intended to Join in a march fxo.ft trie oabarmati Ashram to rtac on the 6 th August last* They were, however, arrested under Section 55 of the Criminal Procedure Code and proceedings under section 109, Criminal Procedure Code, were to be launched against them. The District Superintendent of Pol ice also reported that some 300 to 400 persona f ion Kathiawar were expected to attempt to resume the march from the place where the previous batch had been arrested. As no further report has been received from Ahmednbad about this movement, it may be presumed that it has died out.

The Secretariat is solely concerned in publishing reports on visits, laying as a means of propaganda, emphasis on the formation of local committees and on the warm welcome with which the delegation is being received. No collection of funds has been effected yet and reports as to progress are conflicting. The anti-Mufti factions stress that the delegation has not succeeded in its mission, owing to the counter agitation of the Egyptian opponents, the absence of Tapatabai, and the disaffection of Shawkat Ali. These factions say that although several days have passed since the delegation visited Hyderabad, on which much hope was entertained, no news has been received. Whether this is because of the failure of negotiations or is due to Haj Amin’s reticence in such affairs, cannot yet be stated.3 * *«« mm ,,, v snding.. /r • 53 rv. /sis l ^3 Hyderabad - Arrangemente were made h Muaazam Jah and Princes Hilofar to sail for Europe on the 7th AugueX* The Princess will go to her mother at Hice while/the Sahihzada will go to St* Moritz for medical treatment* As at present proposed their stay will be for some two or/three months only* (Vide Resume* for the fortnight ending 31st July 1933). 2* The Grand Mufti of Jerusalam has recently visited Hyderabad and the Resident had a conversation with him on the 25th July, in the course of which he explained to him the objects of his mission.

Beports on the mission of the Palestine delegation to Iraq and India are not encouraging. Thaalihi, Bashid Bida, Tapatahai, Adel Arsalan and Muzghar have all been mentioned as possiblr members but have not joined the delegation for one reason or another, and the one member left in Iraq will be compelled to return as he will find himself unable to undertake the mission in the midst of an economic depression and the pre-occupation of Iraqians in national affairs. Expressions of sympathy are not lacking, but it is funds that are wanted. A report (which is not yet corroborated), alleges that Shawkat Ali is secretly obstructing the delegation in India and that King Peisal, contrary to what has been rumoured, is not favourably disposed towards the institution of the Caliphate as suggested by haj An in. The only other matter of pan-Islamic interest is the arrival in Palestine of Abdel Hai Kittaneh. The pro-Ivlufti faction have abstained from meeting him owing to the belief uhat he is a French propagandist, who supported the French policy towards the Berber tribes. andI and who is on his way to Syria to counteract the anti-French campaign. For party reasons, and following the advice of Mohamed Taftazani of Egypt, the anti- Mufti faction leaders welcomed the visitor during his short stay in Palestine; entertained him at the house of Fegheh Bey, and, in Acre accorded him a warn reception at which speeches were exchanged. x X XEXTRACT PROM PALESTINE POLICE SUMMARY No.16/33, DATED 2 nd JUNE 1933, (P.Z.3535/33). 1. The question of the reinstitution of the Caliphate will form an important subject of discussion between the Palestine Islamic Delegation to India and Nizam Haiderabad and other Indian Moslem princes. According to reports, Moulana Shawkat Ali, who visited • j Europe and Palestine, and preceded Haj Amin to India, is working in the interests of Nizam Haiderabad who aims at the reinstatement of Abdel Majid. Haj Amin Husseini expects, in return for his agreement, to obtain the financial and moral j support of the Nizam to the Islamic Congress and his schemes* It is rumoured that King Peisal has raised no objection, but that ex-King Ali insisted that the Caliphate should be vested in the Hashemite family. The attitude of other rulers interested in the Caliphate such a s Ibn Sioud, King Pouad and (at least for some time) Abbas Hilmi is not known. If the negotiations with Haj Amin succeed, the question will be raised at the forthcoming Islamic Congress whrh is due to be held, perhaps again in Jerusalem, towards the end of 1933. The followers of Haj Amin in Palestine have denied the report, but the anti-Mufti faction has found in it a means to decry the Islamic delegation, and Haj Amin Husseini.p.z.5567/~55- Criminal Investigation Dept., Headquarters, Police and Prisons, p.o.b. 85 ',, Jerusalem. Subject: Periodical Appreciation Summary no. 15 /35- Pan-Islamic Movement . 1 . The most important event during the period under review is the departure of the Islamic delegation to India and Iraq in order to raise funds for the proposed University of Masjid el Aqsa and to spread propaganda in favour of the Palestine Arab case and the purchase of lands for the benefit of the Arabs. Haj Amin is desirous of accomplishing the scheme for the Moslem University, which was decided upon at the Congress, before the second session is held. Another reason for his journey may be connected with the report (which has since been circulated) |j that the question of the Caliphate will be raised at the forthcoming session. The majority of Moslems received the news of the departure of the delegation with gratification, || and the hope has been expressed that the schemes of the Islamic Congress will materialize. leaders of the anti- Mufti faction, with whom are associated certain Eygptians who attended the I93I Congress, have commenced activity and caused telegrams to be sent to Indian leaders against the delegation. The Husseini faction, however, are confident that these activities will not effect the mission in view of the popularity of the members of the delegation. x x x x xp.z. 5007 /^. 50 /G/s.

S ubject : Periodical Appreciation Summary No. 14/33 • X X X X X X Moslem Affairs. 4 - As originally suggested by Haj Amin Husseini, it would appear that the second Islamic Congress will take place in Palestine, owing to its geographical position, its religious associations and its special political position, which, it has been stated, calls for Moslems sympathy more than any other country. It would appear that Shawkat Ali was more favourably disposed to the plans of Haj Amin Husseini than on the former occasion of his earlier visit; and it has been stated that he may visit Afghanistan, i before his return to Palestine, in order to discuss a suggestion that the brother of the Emir of Afghanistan should preside over the next Congress. The ’expected visit to India via Iraq at the head of the Palestine delegation of Haj Amin Husseini, in company of Tapatabai and Mohamed Ali Pasha, is expected to take place very shortly, x x x x x xMr .Walton . Haj Amin el Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem. He is the leading Arab in Palestine and generally the big noise in Moslem circles there. .His particular political party is fairly extreme and anti-Glovernment but he was whitewashed in the Shaw report on the 1929 disturbances. He is President of the Moslem Supreme Council, which controls the Moslem Courts and Wakfs. (Information derived from C.O. and P. k J.(S) 1737/31- flagged). He was the dominating personality, despite opposing factions, of the pan-Islamic Conference of 1931. In March 1932 his influence -was said to be rather on the decline and to some -extent to depend on the future of the Congress. (P.Z.2990/32). The 1931 Congress spent some time discussing the project for a Moslem University in Jerusalem and passed a resolution flagged at P. &amp; J.(S)179/32- enjoining the collection of funds etc.with a view to discussion of the educational side at the next Conference. The Muftis* present move seems to follow from this Resolution (cf.P.Z.5326/32) and there can be no doubt that Shaukat Ali,who is closely connected with the whole Conference, is concerned. We/We have had no information about this visit to India x other than P # &amp; J.(S) 564/33(attached) and P.Z.2931. I managed to elicit from the C.O. 7 without saying why I asked - that they had not official information either.

XXX XX X 2 . Pan-Islamic Movement. In regard to the pan-Islamic movement, no material progress has been made in the Moslem University scheme or the despatch of delegations, but attention is already concentrated on the second convention which it is proposed, to hold in the fall of this year, which Haj Amin desires in Jerusalem. Shawkat Ali since his arrival has been engaged in negotiations between Haj Amin and his opponents with a view to reconciling their views. He seems to be not opposed to the convention being held in Jerusalem but is desirous that better arrangements, and a more proportionate representation of the Moslem countries, are effected at the future Congress. The arfci- Mufti faction, as represented by Fakhri and Ragheb Bey Nashashibi and Ahmed el Khaldi, (Principal of the Government Arab College), have made their participation conditional on the change of the constitution of the Congress, and have required that Haj Amin should give an undertaking to this end, and, that, if he feils to carry out his undertaking, the Indian delegates should join the anti-Mufti faction delegates in withdrawing from the Congress. Shawkat Ali has been unable to effect any compromise; it is unlikely that Haj Amin will agree to co-operation with his opponents, while these, despite all their professions, will not agree to the Congress being held/held in Jerusalem; and in this they seem to he supported by the Egyptian delegates who attended the 193 1 Congress. While in Jerusalem, Shawkat Ali delivered two speeches. In his first speech at the Arab Club in Bethlehem he described the interest taken by the Arabs and Moslems in general in the Holy Land, and his own efforts on behalf of the people, and said that the most important task in Palestine at present was to secure the cooperation of all leaders. In his second speech at the Mosque of Omar during the Nebi Musa festivities, he exhorted the congregation not to sell their lands to Jews and pledgedr !$ / ^ copy- (E 1630/1838/65) THE RESIDENCY, P.Z.
