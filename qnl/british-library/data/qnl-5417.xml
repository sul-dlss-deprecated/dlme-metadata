Yfe have been thinking seriously of suggesting this for some [? gp. omitted]. '.Thereas the rest of Persia is covered by British consulates whose incumbents keep us fully informed of what happens in their districts, we have no one to report on Gilan and Mazanderan. Such information as we get is gleaned either secondhand or from occasional and hasty tours of this Embassy. The proximity of these provinces to Russia makes it more important now than ever that v/e should have observation post there. The opening of the Russian consulate in Shiraz gives us our opening. 3, Most urgent step is to obtain the Persian Government’s permission while they are still amenable. The question of an incumbent can be considered slightly more at leisure. Career man with knowledge of Persian and/or Russians would be best but until you can make a suitable man available v/e could for instance send Savory to carry on and leave Ramadan vacant temporarily. Although Ramadan is important Resht I consider is more so. May I ask the Persian Government for permission as proposed?

In August 1935 the Vice Consiilate at Resht was closed. No Vice Consul had been appointed there for over tfcee-years (P.Z.6207/33) and. various Vice - Consular duties had been performed by a Munshi (P. Z. 5438/35) • In March, 1936* the property was sold for Rials 59,750 (P.Z. 2246/36). Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, when His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in a despatch dated May 1935 (P.Z. 5488/35) in which he advised the closing of the Vice Consulate, says that 'the only arguments that I can think of in favour of re-appointing a Vice Consul are, firstly, that Resht is a convenient observation post for the watching of Soviet activities, and secondly that, owing to the personal interest taken in the Caspian Provinces by the Shah and with the construction of a railway to link them with Tehran, they are likely to assume a growing importance economically.' He goes on to say 'it is of course possible that with the pursuit of a more forward foreign policy by the Soviet Government it might prove desirable to re-open the post.' This situation has now arisen,and Sir Reader Bullard, the present Minister at Tehran, has recommended the establishment of a Career Consulate at Resht for the duration of the war. ( The total amount involved would certainly be in excess of £1000 - Consuls salary £800 to £1000, local allowance £100, Customs allowance on the scale approved for Persia,together with the office allowance (which in 1933 amounted to Rials 21,350 + (P.Z. 6207/33)). It is suggested, however, that the proposal might be accepted without reference to India. A draft to the Foreign Office concurring in the appointment is therefore submitted.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No.461 (K 9509/329/234) of the 3rd September regarding the sale of the consular property at Resht. 2. As I had reason to believe that the Imperial Bank of Iran might be interested in the property, I enquired of the Chief Manager of their Tehran office whether the Bank wished to buy it* The matter was referred to the Board in London and I have now been informed that they have decided tiiat they do not wish to acquire the property* 3. I have requested the Bank to act as Agents for the sale through their Resht Manager, and as a first step to obtain a valuation of the property. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter from the Manager of the Bank’s office there, from which it will be seen that the value set upon the property by an experienced local valuer is Rial HI 1 855. one hundred and eleven thousand, eight hurdred and fifty £l f 305. five (about one thousand three hundred and five pounds). Rls.40.000 . £470 . Rls.50.000 . £587/10/- . 4. No offers have as yet been received, and I understand that in the opinion of the Bank’s Resht Manager, while a buyer should be found easily enough at a price of from Rials forty thousand (four hundred and seventy pounds) to Rials fifty thousand (five hundred and eighty seven pounds and ten shillings), it is unlikely that in existing circumstances a better price will be obtained. It appears, therefore, that The Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc. The Foreign Office. little/little reliance can be placed upon the valuation obtained by Mr* Coffey. 5.

Confidential . w v ^ ^.British Legation, ► * Tehran. 4th May, 1935. Sir, The death of Samsam-ul-Kuttub, reported in my despatch No. 189 of the 1st May, raises as an immediate issue the question of the future of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Resht. The system in force for the past two years or so, whereby the post remained temporarily unfilled and the Munshi addressed periodical reports to His Majesty’s Legation, worked well enough; but whereas the system was a satisfactory one so long as the Munshi was an old and trusted Government servant, I am of opinion that it woula not now be possible to engage a new munshi who would be able to perform the same services. We therefore seem to be faced with the alternative of appointing a new Vice-Consul and re-opening the post, or of closing the post altogether. 3. After considerable thought I have reached the conclusion that the only sound policy is to close the f post and dispose of the property. The only arguments that I can think of in favour of re-appointing a Vice-Consul are, firstly, that Resht is a convenient observation post for the watching of Soviet activities, and secondly that, owing to the personal interest taken in the Caspian provinces by the Shah ana with the construction of a railway to link them with Tehran, they are likely to assume a growing importance economically./ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office. 9economically. 4* On the other hand I feel that, with the present trend of Soviet foreign policy, there is little or no justification for the maintenance of a career Consula* officer at Resht, if the main object in so doing is that he should study Soviet activities. It is, of course, possible tnat with the pursuit of a more forward foreign policy by the Soviet Government it might prove desirable to re-open the post, but in present circumstances I consider that results in this field would not justify the expense. 5. Nor do I think that at present the Caspian provinces have sufficient importance for it to be worth while maintaining a Consular officer at Resht on economic grounds. A revival of Irano-Soviet trade or the increase in the volume of business that should ensue when the railway has been completed may render necessary a modification of this view. But if it should later prove desirable to maintain a Consulate on the Caspian seaboard for economic reasons, then I think it will be found that Resht will be too far removed from the main stream of commerce and that there would be greater advantages in establishing a new post at, say, Bander-i-Shah. 6. For the present, however, I see no real need for a Consulate in the Caspian area and if the choice immediately before us is restricted, as I believe it to be, to the re-appointment of a Vice-Consul to Resht or the closing down of the post, I am drawn to the conclusion that the latter is the wiser course.

We have been in consultation with the Office of Works regarding the disposal of the consular property at Resht, and they inform us that they have only been able to obtain an offer of a small contribution (90 rials per month) from the Imperial Bank of Persia towards the upkeep of the property as a supplement to their former offer of 350 rials a month as rent, which is considered not sufficient to make % the offer an attractive proposition* We note from Mr* Mallets dispatch of 28th August that the premises are in a bad condition and as house property in Resht has a tendency to deteriorate rapidly, unless there is a real likelihood that this post will be reopened in the near future, it looks as though it would be best to dispose of the property as soon as possible. We should be glad to know whether in the circum stances the Foreign Office feel that the property might be disposed of. I’m afraid that we shall have to ask for a fairly early reply. The Office of Works have been negotiating with the Imperial Bank of Persia representatives on a rental basis, % and we cannot keep them dangling indefinitely. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) E.E* BRIDGES. R.

The Secretary of State proposes to accept the suggestions in paragraph 6 of Mr. Mallet’s despatch for effecting economies at the Vice-Consulate and, as will be observed, favours the acceptance of the proposal for leasing the consular property to the Imperial Bank of Persia. I am to ask for any observations that the Secretary of State for India may have to offer on the above points.

(K 10582/3790/234) 1933 _J ^fTtlCsii legation, Calhelc. 28th August, 1933. ^5 Sir, In accordance with the instructions contained in your despatch No. 265 of July 3rd (K 6093/3790/234), I have the honour to submit the ' following recommendations regarding expenditure on the Vice-Consulate at Hesht during the xime that it is closed. 2. The only substantial item of expenditure which has not already been eliminated, and which cannot in my opinion be eliminated, is the salary of the Munahi. 3. Gilan and Mazanderan form geographically a region entirely distinct from the rest of Persia, with different products and different industries. They are, moreover, owing to their heavy rainfall, the richest and most productive provinces in the country. Their natural advantages are being sedulously fostered ^y the present ?* - 1 Shah and his Government, and in all directions new i factories are ^eing built, new roads constructed, and new crops encouraged. Nesht and the lesser ports on the Caspian Sea are, moreover, the channel for a large part of the country's trade to and through the Soviet union. 4. The importance of the two provinces has been considered sufficiently great in the past for a Vice- Consul, and even a Consul, to be stationed at Nesht. Various factors, such as the increased facility of communi cation The Right Honourable Sir John Si.ion, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.6. communication with the capital, the need for economy and the fact that the direct participation of British capital in the enterprise of the Caspian littoral is not great, admittedly render such an appointment unnecessary for the time 'Heing. ■Rut the provinces are still of sufficient importance to render the retention of the Munshi indispensable. Apart from seeing to various matters of routine, the Munshi submits valuable commercial and general reports to the legation, and I hials 7 oq consider the payment of his salary (at present only seven hundred hials a month) and of the small incidental expenditure which his employment entails to be amply justified. 5. The following comparative table shows the savings on the office allowance at present being effected Office Allowance: Hials: Now paid: Hial s*. Saving Rials Munshi 8,400 8,400 Gatekeeper 1,980 1,980 - Three ferrashes. 5,940 1,980 3,960 Total wages: 16,520 12,560 5,960 Heating and lighting. 1,125 560 765 Telephone. 240 240 - Newspapers. 280 40 240 Conveyances. 75 - 75 Gratuities. 1,110 615 495 Sundries. 200 200 - Uniforms. 2,000 1,000 1,000 21,550. 14,815 6,555 This table also illustrates the nature of the expenditure and shows that the amount spent on items other than wages Hials is now the very low figure of itials two thousand four 2,455. hundred and fifty five per annum.6* The following economies might also he effected, and I either propose to put them into effect or suggest that your Department should do so. (a) the supply of all works of reference and periodicals from the United Kingdom should cease. (h) the separate supply of stationery should cease. His Majesty's Legation supplying from time to time such small requirements as the Munshi may have. (c) the disconnection of the telephone should ^e effected if, after the next memher of the Legation visits Keaht, the telephone is reported to he unnecessary. 7* beyond this point, I do not consider that further econo lies can ^e effected. A gatekeeper and office attendant is essential, and as the ferrash looks after the garden his employment is necessary in order to maintain the amenities and value of the property. It might he oossihle, however, to dispense with his services if the property were sold. So long as these two menials are retained, they must have new year gratuities and uniforms, hut these are very small items. A certain minimum of expenditure on heating and lighting is unavoidable, the telephone is usually considered an essential element in modern life (though it may nrove possible to dispense with a telephone in this case) and the Munshi must obviously he a^le to study the local press. 8. The remaining item of expenditure is the maintenance of the property. For facility of reference I give the following rough sketch plan of the premises:Roa^- The lane J± is wide enough for motor traffic and it would therefore he possible to dispose of the house and garden separately by making a new gate at X, and a raised approach on the inner side, the lane being a few feet higher than the garden (lane ^ is very long and narrow). For the house Rials and garden alone it has been estimated that eighty thousand 80 , 000 . Rials might be obtained, provided of course that His Majesty's Government were orepared - and let possible purchasers know that they were prepared - to await a good offer. 9. Another alternative would be to throw in the two garages, as this would undoubtedly add to the value of the property, but the cost of the necessary partition wall would probably outweigh the addition to the price. The same consideration would apply to the reconstruction of the officeso as to make it directly accessible from the road, as at present constructed it depends entirely on the yard for access and light, having a verandah and a number of doors on that side, and to reconstruct it would not he worth the trouble and expense• 10. a third alternative would he to share the entrance with the purchaser of the' house, either selling him the garages and the ground of the yard while retaining a right of way to the office, or else renting him the garages.. The second arrangement would nrobahly avoid complications. 11. The house is at present in fairly good condition as houses go in Besht. Mr. Saeed, the architect of the Imperial ^ank of Persia was recently so good as to inspect it in the course of a visit to Besht, and Mr. George is now obtaining estimates for some of the repairs which he recommended as necessary. Ordinarily the expenditure on raaintenance does not exceed three thousand rials. 13. .apart from the convenience of visiting members of the legation, who would generally prefer to comp in the Vice- Consulate rather than go even to what is one of the best hotels in Persia, the only argument in favour of retaining the house is the possibility of re-opening the post in a few years time. Houses, however, deteriorate quickly in Besht and were it not for the offer of the Imperial ^ank of Persia which I mention below, I should, therefore, feel constrained, much as I should like to retain it and its attractive garden, to recommend that it should be sold if a good offer could b e obtained. 13. I have, however, been asked by the Chief Manager of the Imperial ^ank of Persia whether the ^ank could lease thethe house for their accountant (the second in command of the branch) and I enclose a copy of his letter. Although the rent does not sound high, you will observe that it works out at over five per centum annually on the estimated value of the property. The ^ank would, I presume, accept the usual liability to leave the house in good and tenantable condition, although certain expenditure would still be incurred, it seems to me that the rent receivable would just make it worth while retaining the property against the possibility of future use, and I recommend that this should be done. 14. In any case, as the accountant will shortly need accommodation, I suggest that you should authorise me by tele gram to conclude a gentleman's agreement with the ^ank for the rent of the house for, say, one year, on the terms they offer. During this time the details of a lease can be worked out, if it is decided to adopt the policy of renting, or a purchaser can be sought, if it is decided to sell. As I do not suppose that a purchaser could be found under some months, the rent will in any case be so much profit. 15. So long as the Vice-Consulate is 'temporarily closed' in the Persian official view, I do not anticipate that any difficulty will arise over the employment of the Munshi, but if the authorities raise objections his employment will have to be reconsidered. 16. I propose to send a member of the Legation staff to tfesht during the course of the next month or two to make arrangements for the disposal of the archives, some of which are at present deposited with the Imperial ^ank of Persia, check the office furniture and generally inspect the prevailing arrangements.

I fear we are not in a position to pay a higher rent than the sum mentioned above, nor to incur any other expenditure, such as repairs, garden up-keep, etcetera.

Sir, In reply to your despatch No. 121 of March 27th, I have the honour to state that, in view of the uncertainty as to the future status of the post, no steps have hitherto been taken to effect economies at the Vice- Consulate at Resht 'beyond those already achieved 'by the fact that no Vice-Consul is in residence; the economies £600 . thus affected amount to some eight hundred pounds, including pay of Consul, allowances, etcetera. 2. Now, however, that Mr. Summerscale has 'been appointed Assistant Oriental Secretary (and, potentially temporary Vice-Consul at Resht), the future of the post is clearer, and I will investigate the possibility of making further economies. Before actually putting any economies into effect, however, I should be glad to learn definitely that there is no immediate intention of re-opening the post as a full Vice-Consulate. 3. I may add that I do not anticipate that any substantial economies can be effected. Apart from the personal salary and allowances of the Vice-Consul, the expenses of the post are not much more than about two £200 hundred pounds a year. This is largely accounted for by the maintenance of the house and the salary of the Munshi, who appears to me to be indisnensable and who is already complaining that his salary is inadequate.

Prima facie the F.O. proposals, which have been sanctioned by the Treasury subject to our concurrence, seem reasonable, but they represent a x considerable increase over the allowance fixed in 1924 (see page 5, para. 10 of the Vice-Consul’s report). The F.O. (or Treasury) have reduced the Vice-Consul's estimate, which the Minister Tehran approved, by Krans 50. For concurrence in the draft letter consulting the G. of I. or any observations.

With regard to the notes by Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Janes (now placed below the Draft), there is apparently no rule of procedure about consulting India before accepting a moiety of D. and C. Expenditure in Persia in the F.O. sphere, and our practice in this matter has varied. The position as between the Imperial Govt.,represented by the F.O. (and the Treasury), and the ”G. of I', represented by the Govt, in India and the S. of S. in London, is quite clear. The sanction of the other party is required (1) For any D. and C. Expenditure in Persia except i- Fresh expenditure on salaries up to an/an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at any one consulate; jq . Increased expenditure on contingencies except as regards an unusual itan exceeding £100, and iii . Increased expenditure on travelling. (2) For any addition to the office allowances and other contract grants of any Agency or. consulate in Persia, except temporary overdrafts not exceeding Rs.250 at any Agency or Consulate, such overdrafts being adjusted by debit against the contract grants sanctioned for the ensuing financial year. Ft any increase of expenditure not covered by the exceptions mentioned above, the F.O. have to obtain the concurrence of the S. of S, for I. while the G. of !• have to obtain the concurrence of the Imperial Government^though this is actually described in the regulations (now incorporated in the rules appended to the Central Audit K Resolution^ as the sanction of the S. of S. for 1. It would appear then that it is purely a matter X [rt Lx. &amp; P' r &gt; r Llr J. f of discretion whether the G. of I. should be consulted or hot ^ consulted by this office in cases of this kind. In the present case the F.G. were bound by the rules to obtain our concurrence for an increased office allowance at Resht. Although the increased amount,to be incurred by Indian revenues is small (about £13 more than last year, or £33 more than 1924), it might be as well to consult India as proposed, a|s neither this Department nor the A.G.’s Department can find any record of the fixing of the allowance in 1924. At any rate it can do no harm. ~7L k % Cvc *-*' Li . t-rJ ^ L ,P.Z. 1578/32. Draft Paper. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign St Political Dept., HEW DELHl-r Copy U/ F.O.

The amount actually expended has provided summer and winter unlfoms for the gatokeep®** and three ferrashes, with accessories such as ahoes end hats of local make, and winter overcoat®. Uniforms, shoes and hats are annually recurring charges, but the over coat# should last about three years on the average. 5. Schedule (4) f heating and lighting, has cost in the year ended 'ecember 31*t, 1931, rana 1 , 353.80 in all, made up of the following iterns:- Of flee firewood ► rane 880. Electric Light * 63.80 Charcoal for gatekeeper M 410.The amount of Krana 410 for charcoal Includes a sum of Krans ?S&gt;8 for charcoal purchased by my predecessor on the 19th Nov ember 1930 and passed through the accounts on Slarch 30th 1931. This Item really belongs to the twelve months ended December 31st 1930 and should therefore be subtracted from the figure of Krans 1,3^3.80 to arrive at the actual expenditure for the year 1931# which thus stands at Krans 1,125.80. 6. Newspaper subscriptions, schedule (5) of the office allowance, amounted to Krane 280 durlnsr the year 1931# com posed as follows:- subscription to Reaht newspaper’Parvarlsh* —^rs. 40. * Tehran * *?£e8Ba*er de Teheran' Krs.240. 280 . The subscription to the local newspaper ’Parvarlsh* has been maintained by the Vice-Consulate for many years, while the sub scription to the *Wessager de Teheran' is an Innovation which the Legation has long urged this Vice-Consulate to make lor the purpose of keeping properly Informed about the new laws and reculatlons :aade by the reraian Government which are pub lished in that Journal, 7. '’arrlsffe hire, schedule (6) of the office allowance, amounted to Krans 63 only In the year 1931. This amount will ftppear very moderate when X mention that the Governor of the Province lives at a considerable distance from the Vice- Consulate and that it costs Krans 12 to hire a carriage every time en official visit le made to him. 8. Schedule (7) of the office allowance, Nauru* gratui ties, absorbed Krans 660 in the year 1931. This amount will be exceeded in 1935? since it is the custom to pay the gatekeeper and ferr^snes one month's pay as a Nauru* gratuity, and they muet now be paid at Krans 165 each Instead of Krans 130 as last year. The sum I should propose therefore for Nauru* gratultleagratultle* is:- Munatil Krans ?QQ. Gatekeeper 165. 3 ferrashee ; Krs.165 ©aoh 495.

The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India,P1 WJW8B British Vice Consulate, No.38. P e s h t, June 12th, 1926. Sir, I beg leave to inform you that I have found myself greatly hampered at times by the want of proper maps of the eastern part of my consular district, i.e. of the Astarabad province. Several useful maps of Gilan are available here, and there is one map of Mazandaran, but for Astarabad I have only a copy which I myself made while I was on tour last year from a sketch map in the possession of the Director of Finance of that province. This only shows the villages in the immediate vicinity of Astarabad town. 2. In order that I may properly understand the reports received from the Astaratad Consular Agent and obtain a thorough grasp of the political and military situation there, it is essential that I should have at hand maps of the whole Astarabad province as far as the Russian frontier along the Atrik River and the border of the Khorasan province towards Eujnurd. 3. I am informed by the Military Attache that the maps which I should find useful are:- Meshed Sheet 1 : 1,000,000 Degree Sheets 15 K, 15 L, 15 N, 15 0, 15 P, 22 B, 22 F, 22 C, 22 G, and I beg leave to request you to be so good as to ask the Government of India to supply me with these maps for the use of this Vice Consulate.
