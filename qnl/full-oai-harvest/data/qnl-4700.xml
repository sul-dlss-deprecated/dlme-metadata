In a copy of a letter to the Government of India's External Affairs Department, dated 16 July 1945, a request is made by the Secretary to the Political Resident for two motorcycles (one with a sidecar) for the Agency. In a copy of a response from the Under-Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, dated 8 October 1945, the request is turned down and it is suggested that another cyclist should be deployed 'for such time as the work is heavy for two men'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Motorcycles</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bicycles</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
