B., dated 17th May, regarding Bahrein affairs, and to submit the further report called for in paragraph 8 thereof. 2. Before dealing with the questions of reform under consideration, I beg to offer some explanations regarding one or-t^o points which have^given Govern ment cause for remark, in the hope of removing misunderstanding if any exists. I regret in the first place that the digression in paragraph 4 of my letter of, I ith March as to the possibilities of Bahrein as a centre of British influence in. # • We did not say so. the Persian Gulf should have appeared C[urzon]. strikingly * irrelevent. With reference to the paragraphs preceding it, I would explain that while I knew there were considered to be objections to the modification of our attitude in regard to Bahrein, on the score of temporary political expediency, I did not realise that the suggested con • version of a partial into an effective protectorate over the islands was in itself distasteful to His Majesty's Government, and foreign to the policy which they are pursuing in the Persian Gulf. It was rather in my mind when I wrote that since I have been at Bushire, His Majesty's Prime Minister in a public speech circulated to the world by Reuter, referred to Bahrein as being virtually a British Protectorate or words to * No. 402 in Secret e ., March 1905, nos.s^q - that effect, and also that on 'j' 2 1 st January 422. last the Government of India expressed the opinion to the Secretary of State that the present opportunity seemed par ticularly favourable for proclaiming our Protectorate. I learn too from my record, that a little later, on 22nd February 1905 His Majesty's Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated to the Turkish Ambassador that it was a matter of common knowledge that ' the island (of Bahrein) and its natives are under British Protection and on the same page ^of the record I read that His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople informed the Sublime Porte categorically on 12th August 1835 that all Turkish claims to Bahrein ' which is under the protection of the Queen of England ' were totally inadmis sible. I now realise that at the time of addressing the Government of India -on nth March I did not adequately appreciate the width of the Gulf which diplo macy places between the interpretation of the expression ' under the protection of ' and ' under the protectorate of '. 3. Referring now to the question of the Bahrein Customs I have to regret too that my express reason for omitting mention of it, was not apparent to the Government of India as I thought it would be. I beg to explain it. In doing so I would first invite reference to the two telegrams marginally Foreign Department ^o. 85-E. b.. dated 6th noted. In the latter I expressed the no. 391 and 195in Jan uar y &gt;9os- opinion or the hope that even if the seiz- 1905,. No. 3®p'4^*. Resident's reply dated-^jth Ute of the Customs did not Constitute January 1905. part of his punishment, the thorough bring ing of Sheikh Esa to his bearings would cause him to accept his Political Agent's 'advice regarding to Customs when next it was offered, after a convenient inter val of time. Subsequently in the telegram which was repeated to me under Foreign Department No. 744-E. B., dated 18th February, the Secretary of State for India observed— • 'j ' If is not considered expedient by His Majesty's Government to sanction the measure which you proprose in connection with the occupation See Nos. 416 and 41 7 in Secret E., March 1905, the Custom House ; for Nos. 369-422. this reason that the connec tion of Sheikh Ali's lawlessness and hts uncle's inability to control 46 •I' SgjJSBB BW Sk wr —*■ him, with the Custms difficulties, is so remote. Suspicions injuri ous to our other interests in the Persian Gulf might be aroused thereby 4. I world next refer to paragraph 6 of my letter No. 123 of n th March. This was written immediately on conclusion of operations at Bahrein. I had doubts as to whether Government would consider that the measures taken were completed and sufficient, and had told Sheikh Esa so. My opinion that Sheikh Esa was hopeless as a Ruler had been strengthened, and I suggested to Govern ment that we should strike while the iron was hot and should inform Sheikh Ksa that we ' propose to make the following arrangements in which he is Expected to acquiesce.' The measures thus proposed by me were clearly put forward as a comple tion or continuance of the coercion, to be applied, I hoped, almost at once ; and i submit that in the face of the Secretary of State's dictum that the control ot the Customs should not be effected in immediate connection with the jecent- incidents, I could not properly have included a repetition of any proposal in that direction among the reforms which I recommended Government to impose upon Sheikh Esa forthwith. I thouajht in fact that it was now accepted that we^ must content ourselves with the hope that the desired changes in this connection would eventually be brought about by the personal influence over the Sheikh which Governments newly appointed Agent at Bahrein might be expected gradually to acquire. This reform of the Customs through British supervision is a paramount objec tive which neither the Political Agent nor I have for a moment lost sight of or ceased to discuss, but while I am personally hopeful, I cannot say that the latest Bahrein reports give cause for immediate encouragement. Captain Prideaux has his heart 'thoroughly in his work and is^ doing his utmost but he has a task before him which would have been a sufficiently dim- cult one even for a Political Officer possessing exceptional colloquial prohciency in Arabic ; and he has further had to contend with initial difficulties wh'.ch it is necessary that Government should know, and take into account. He has taken up Arabic since his appointment to Bahrein, but naturally cannot yet communicate with the Sheikh except through a third party, and this question of a medium of communication has, from the beginning been a dimcult one • -for the worthy old munshi of the Agency, on whom the duty should pro- parly fall, besides being a Shiah by religion, is in other respects not a persona with the Sheikh. This was fully realised, but suitable men are very dith- cult to cret and it was only recently that Captain Prideaux was able to obtain from India the services of a young man of good education and antecedents possessing a good knowledge of Arabic. It will be some little time however before he can become thoroughly versed in the work required of him. Apart from this Captain Prideaux was formerly, as the Government of India may remember, First Assistant in this Residency, and while holding that post, was sent on an important mission to Bahrein by Colonel Meade to remind t e Sheikh generally of his obligations and to put pressure on him with regard to several matters of which settlement was badly required. The recollection of his former visit on the above duty was perhaps in the first instance hardly the best recommendation for a new Political Agent to the Sheikh's confidences. While reiterating therefore that Captain Prideaux is working thoroughly, well and doing his utmost to further the policy of Government, I can but expect that some little time must elapse before he can hope to acquire, if indeed it is possible for any one to do so in the case of Sheikh Esa, that position of friendly and imperceptible domination which is the only kind of influence that can be really efficacious in a case of a long standing intractability like the present. .v &gt; i ' r- 46. Referring to paragraphs 7 and 8 of Foreign Departme-nt letter -mder reply, it will 1 think now be clear to Government that the proposal re^ardine a V azier was made on the supposition that Sheikh Esa would be compelled to accept him, and his appointment was not associated in any way with the question 0 ij 5 ! 01118 contr . ; anc ^ ^ concur with Government in thinking that the Sheikh would be no more likely to accept willingly a nominee of ours as his Vazier than as t e superintendent of his Customs. The difference that the two proiects presented to my mind was, that having regard to the views of His Majestv's Secretary of State in the telegram above quoted, the appointment of an Arab Vazier to keep order in Manamah had more close connection with Sheikh Ali's lawlessness and the inability of Sheikh Esa to control him, and lay the disinterest edness ot our motives open to less suspicion than did the assumption of British supervision or control over the Bahrein Customs. 7. Before giving a final answer to the three questions ■ (a) How the Sheikh may be expected to regard the different proposals for reform. r r (6) How far he is likely to prove amenable to the authoritative 'adTice and innuence of his Political Agent. (c) In what manner pressure should, if necessary, be applied. I would prefer to visit Bahrein again if possible. Unfortunately at oresem the port is plague-infected and to go there means 9 days' quarantine on return. Meanwhile I shall communicate with Captain Prideaux and act on the in structions conveyed to me in paragraphs (5) {d} and (c) and 9. No. 250, dated Bushire, the 4th June 1905. From—M ajor P. Z.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, No. 173, dated adth Ma, .905. a .T 1 ^ 'j 3 communication, with enclosure, addressed to me by the Political Agent at Bahrein on the subject of the Institution of Slavery as it exists within Sheikh Esa's jurisdiction. 2. In the course of his communication Captain-PrideauK alludes.to several items of correspondence on the records of this Residency, with regard to which I beg to supply in the enclosures to this letter, the necessary references or informa tion as follows :— ma) Alleged rendition of 270 slaves to their masters after the Zobara incident in 1895, {vide paragraph 7, Political Agent's letter). A precis of the Residency file on this subject is attached. Enclo sure 2. The information given by the Dowasir Sheikh is not accurate as will be seen. (3) Mr. Gaskin's letter to the Resident, No. 55 of 18th April 1903 {vide paragraph 8 of Political Agent's present letter). A copy of this was.forwarded to the Government of India with my predecessor's letter No. 70, dated 30th April 1903 ; and certain further papers in the same connection were subsequently received from the foreign Department under their endorsement No. 112- E. A., dated !2th January 1904. I beg reference to these papers. (c) Residency No. 535, dated 4th June 1900. Copies of correspondence are attached. (Enclosure 3). Captain Prideaux has gone fully in to the subject, and it is incumbent upon me to place his views on this important topic before Government without delay. In doing so however 1 have the honour to state that although there is no reason to doubt that there is much force in the Political Agent's observations and although his proposals are excellent in principle, I fear they amount to a counsel of perfection which is practically impossible of fulfilment under existing conditions, and further I cannot but consider that under any circumstances the present juncture is not a suitable one for making new departures of a drastic nature in the direction under advertence. The Government of India have clearly signified that they wish to make the best of Sheikh Esa. In that case except in regard to measures which it may be decided to impose upon him as an immediate consequence of his recent contu macy, with which questions of slave trade have had no connection, we need to- adopt a policy of /est in a lente in applying new reforms. Sheikh Esa is an old man, too old probably to change his spots to any great extent, and in the matter of the slave trade I doubt if much better results could be expected even from a new treaty, in his lifetime. 4. Even.* if the case were otherwise and if Government contemplated setting up a new Chief or declaring a Protectorate, a sweeping measure of reform in connection with the slave trade, though it might be a natural and proper corollary to the change in due course of time, would certainly not be ;he best method of heralding it in either in our own interests or in the ultimate interests of the people, whom we desire to benefit. [C334FD.] wm - . • 12 5. What we as a nation have done In these waters, for the best part 6t a century, in the direction of the suppression of slavery, may not—does not no doi'bt—represent the ideal of the Anti-Slavery Society or the Missionary element in the Persian Gulf, but one thing is I think undeniable and that is that having regard to the good which we habitually and unobtrusively do year after year in the direction of the manumission of slaves, and the odium which we voluntarily incur in doing it, no Power signatory to the Brussels Act can show a record which will in any way compare with ours. This being the case, I do not consider that we have the least reason as a nation to tax ourselves with neglect in respect of our obligations either under the laws of humanity or the Brussels Act. At the same time the picture drawn by Captain Prideaux certainly indicates that there is considerable room for improvement in the po^^^n at Bahrein. I hope to show, however, that with the means at present at our disposal we can place things on a better footing there without embarking on sweeping changes which would I believe rouse the feeling of the whole of the Gulf Arabs against us. Before making specific suggestions I beg leave to summarise Captain Prideaux's several proposals and to comment briefly upon them. - 6. He asks first— (i) That a definite conclusion should be arrived at as to what classes of negroes are to be supported in their application for freedom. At Maskat and elsewhere this point is quite clear. Any negro able to prove that he has been enslaved since the date of the local Slave Treaty, is considered entitled to freedom, if it is not proved that he is -an absconding debtor or a malefactor in other ways. This principle has never been relaxed and on this basis over 90 per cent, of slaves taking refuge within the Political Agent's jurisdiction are freed annually, with the. concurrence of the Sultan and ^with very little friction. At Bahrein, however, the question is more complicated in that the above principle does not appear to have been rigidly adhered to. As the case now stands, if we go back to the date of the Treaty of 1856 (not 1847 I think) the slaves who are entitled to freedom may, according tc? Captain Prideaux's estimate, be reckoned in thousands. If we are going to start on new lines, I should think 10 years would be a convenient limit; to go back beyond that would be to set ourselves a very formidable task. The Political Agent goes on to propose a new Treaty providing for— (11) The registration of all existing domestic born slaves and of others over certain age if this concession is considered desirable. Such a register might be Inaugurated and kept up under a British Protector ate, but I do not think it would be wise to attempt to bring it in under the regime of Sheikh Esa as at present existing. There would be a natural tendency to try and bring all slaves on to the register in the first instance and each case, if it had to be verified, would become an inconvenient element of contention between the Sheikh and his Political Agent. (ill) An efficient system of preventing the importation or re-enslaving of other negroes and Baluchls. Here Captain Prideaux seems somewhat to beg the main question. If any one could devise such a system, the slave trade would very soon die out. As the Government of India are aware, the Persian Government gives us no help in respect of Baluchis. As regards the African trade, the best and most productive deterrent is the organised patrolling of our Men-of-War at the recognisad* seasons both on the African and on the South Arabian Coast. This for some reason has, I believe, fallen a good deal into desuetude during the last decade, probably because other important work has kept His Majesty's ships fully employed. -fiv) The abolition among Muhammadan familie-s, of the power to sell domestic slaves from one family to another.Cases of gross or repeated ill-treatment are sometimes dealt with even when the slaves concerned are admittedly domestic, but except under an enlightened British protectorate of long standing I fear that any peremptory attempt to stamp out a custom which has the sanction of Islam would meet with determined opposition. 7. I now beg to offer some suggestions which may be held partially to meet the case. Hitherto we have been represented at Bahrein either by a native a^ent or by a junior gazetted officer. 0 It has been the custom for both of these to refer cases of manumission to the Residency. Now however that the status of our representative has been enhanced I see no reason why he should not be authored, as the Political-Agent |at Maskat is, to issue certificates himself after due inquiry and with the time limit suggested in the foregoing paragraph ; namely from 1895. At Maskat the procedure is for the Political Agent to record the evidence and then send the slave with the Agency Munshito the Sultan for such inquiry as the latter may desire to make. If he can produce proofs that the claim is not bona fide he does so, otherwise he has to acquiesce in the man being given a manumission paper. It has apparently not been usually the case to refe?to the Sheikh at Bahrein. I think that ordinarily the local ruler should be consulted, but then Sheikh Esa is not an ordinary character. I solicit the views of Government on this point. With his hands strengthened in the way I suggest and assisted by the personal influence which he should in time gain over the Sheikh of Bahrein our Political Agent will, I should hope, be able to keep him reasonably up to his obligations under his Slave Trade eligagements with us. % 8. Referring to paragraph 15 of the Political Agent's letter I am not sure that I follow h:s reasonins. If we wish to let the people of Bahrein know that we do not connect customs reform with new departures under the Slave Treaties, surely it would be fatal to the success of our policy to preface cur overtures in regard to the former question with drastic reforms in connection with the latter. ^ Once we have the customs under our direct or indirect control, or have a Vazior appointed by Government, we shall be in a much stronger'position to carry Jut such reforms. Until then I think we should proceed very cautiously and that the present requirements of the case can best be met in the way I have suggested. No. 173, dated Bahrein, the 26th May 1905. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux . Political Agent, Bahrein, T o—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. * I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Institution of Slavery as it exists in Bahrein. The manner in which the old-standing agreements in this connection are disregarded by the Chief and his subjects is in my opinion extremely unsatisfactory, and I think the time has come when we should at least take definite steps to ensure the due observance of his obligations by Sheikh Esa, even if we do not introduce into these islands the more desirable system which now exists in Zanzibar. 2. I attach in abbreviated form for ease of reference such extracts from existing agreements between the Government of India and past Rulers of Bahrein as are relevant to this question. Reading the paragraphs alone, and without taking into consideration the effect of our agreement with Persia, which is presumably intended to be analogous and which is certainly considered to be so by the people of Bahrein, one would perhaps infer that it is only in the case ot raw slaves, torn from their homes in Africa and other countries,'such as Balu chistan, that the measures for protection have been instituted. 3. In fact, however,-it has long been recognized by the people of Bahrein that there is great risk in purchasing new slaves even from the people of Katar^4 and Hasa for importation into Bahrein, and numbers of such slaves have annually been given refuge in this Agency and have subsequently been furnished with manumission papers signed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 4. Notwithstanding the recognition of this risk, the importation of fresh slaves continually proceeds, and the attitude of the Chief of Bahrein is absolutely indifferent if not passively hostile to our policy. The pearl-diver's profession is most deleterious to long life, and a middle-aged negro is hardly to be found in- Bahrein. It is moreover believed here that without constant additions of fresh blood the negro population of the islands will not take long to die out. 5. It is estimated that the number of slaves, born outside the Principalitv and later than 1847 A.D., who therefore are entitled to their freedom, may be reckoned in thousands, far the greater majority of these were born in Africa though a percentage, not inconsiderable, has been impDrted from Baluchistan. ^ The number of these men is said to exceed that of the local domestic-bom slaves ; this estimate therefore is not beyond the bounds of belief considering that the Arab pearling-boats, many of which carry.crews ot 60 men to the pearl^banks never include more than two or three so-called ' whites (Arabs) in each. 6. The most persistent importers of slaves are the Arab residents of Muhar- faq, the Sunni Syeds of Hed and the Dowasir tribesmen of Budey'a and Zallaq. It may be remembered that none of these Arabs were found in Bahrein before the advent of the 'Utub 120 years ago, and that a large number including the import ant tribe of the Dowasir only crossed over from the mainland 60 years ago. These people take no interest in agriculture, possess no gardens or live-stock (except slaves), confine themselves purely to the-pearling industry, and contri bute no revenue to the Ruler's finances. 7. I have had several talks with leading--members of the Dowasir on the slave question. They admic that the' conditions of the institution we^e as l describe until ten years ago, but say that at the tune of the Zobara incident in 1895 some verbal arrangement was made, of which I have no knowledge. At that time—they tell me—some 270 slaves of the ordinary imported class took refuge from Bahrein on board our gun-boats ; they were kept for five days while a reference was made to the Resident, Colonel \\ ilson, and tuen were all returned to their masters on the understanding that no fresh importations were to be permitted. 8. I can hardly believe the correctness of this story, and hope thai the true facts may be communicated to me for information. It may be tfcit the unexpected invasion of so many slaves at once was found to be embarrassing and that under special guarantees they were persuaded to go back of their own accord. My predecessor, Mr. Gaskin, too, may have been guided by this precedent in several recent cases when slaves have been returned to their masters. I think that when the slave seems incapable of properly fending for himself or to be a man of bad character it is not other than advantageous both to himself and the public that he should be treated as a child and compelled to remain under responsible restraint. In the majority of cases, however, I fear that it is prejudicial to our best interests and prestige to allow our written agreements to so subside into abeyance. The assertion that since 1895 no fresh slaves have been imported is of course untrue and can be disproved from our records of the numerous cases of manumitted slaves. In this connection, also, I beg to invite a reference to Mr. Gaskin's letter No. 55, dated the 18th April 1903, to which no answer was received, and also to the case of the importation of a boat-load of children from Sur (Oman) into Hed forming the subject of correspondence ending with your office letter No. 535, dated the 4th June 1900. I have been informed by the Revd. S, M. Zwemer that this latter case was a notorious one, and that all the offenders apparently got off scot free. 9 At the present time there are three slaves sheltered in the Agency on whose behalf I am about to apply to you in the ordinary course for manu mission certificates. O10. The strictly correct procedure, perhaps, when a slave has taken refuge, should be to apply to the Chief of Bahrein for the production of the master with a view to an enquiry being held into the circumstances of the alleged impor tation. This course, however, even in the days of the^ last three Native Agents has very rarely, if ever, been followed : partly, perhaps, because Sheikh Esa - never attempts to exert his authority over the outlying Arab strong-holds, and ^principally no doubt because the master himself as a rule follows up the fugitive in hot haste or at latest presents himself within a couple of days at tJie Agency. The sea-faring Arab is not the same business-like, often educa ted, and invariably tutored individual as the Persian slave-importer whom one -meets with in similar circumstances. In the first few sentences he will probably admit the truth of the slave's main allegations. He is then told in the fewest words that his man is entitled to his freedom and th^jrhe himself is fprtunate ^f he escapes punishment, and there the matter ends. In doubtful cases and even in those in which the law is on the master's sidej, the latter never objects to give a written bond, scarcely in fact worth the paper- oo which it is written, to the effect—that henceforth he will treat tue slave kindly and will subject himself to punishment if he fails, and then the unfortunate negro goes back apparently resigned to his fate. I fear, how ever, that the comparative ease with which cases in the past have been settled, will not long continue if the liberation of those slaves, who are really entitled to freedom, is seriously taken up as I think it should be. 11. I have questioned Sheikh Esa on the subject, more especially as to whether any preventive measures are in existence against the importation of newly purchased slaves. He replied that so far as he wp ^ aware he had adhered to the obligations impose^ upon him by treaties. He had 'always taken suitable action in the cases which were brought to his notice by British Officials, and once in the time of the Native Agent Haji Ahmed (who died about 1891 A.D,), and once again in the time of Mr. Gaskin he had of his own inititative given up ^ slaves to be manumitted. The latter case is stated to have been detected in Busaitin'(on Muharraq Island) but my office records contain no reference to it. It is possible that in these two isolated cases the Chief was prompted more by a wish to do injury to some objectionable person than by any sympathy for our policy. The Chief further stated that no special preventive measures had ever been maintained, but that every one knevv that the practice was foroidden Pnd that it could only be carried on at considerable personal risk. He left it to the British Government to arrange their own precautions. 12. In my humble opinion under these arrangements the traffic will never cease. So long as there is a demand for slaves in these parts, the export of them from Africa is surely bound to continue. Bahrein is the most convenient place in the Gulf where the next wedge on behalf of our policy can be inserted not only by reason of its political subordination to the Government of India, but also on account of its insular position and the small though populous area in which the inhabitants reside. 13. Personally I see no insuperable objections to introducing the Zanzibar ordinance at once, not only on the grounds that the existing conventions have proved to be inoperative, but also in the name of humanity which has I believe been the motive prompting us to exact the existing tenns and agreements from the various peoples of the Gulf. There is no strong reason why slaves should be the mainstay of the pearl fisheries, for a large number of Shiahs—the Baharina of Bahrein—are already engaged on their own account in the industry, and it ought not to be impossible for the Arab boat.-oWners to adapt themselves to the practice of employing freed men. Even now they usually hire negroes from other masters to complete their crews. There is no danger, too of the negroes developing into the lazy creatures found in the West Indies and other places blessed with a luxurious vegetation, as here to gain their food they will be compelled to toil, and whether on the pearl-banks or in the agriculture of the islands there is ample room for a com munity many times larger than that which at present exists. r C334FD14. If this sweeping proposal Is considered inopportune, I think that at any rate it is desirable that some definite conc'usion should be arrived at as to what classes of negroes are to be supported in their applications for freedom, and that proper measures should be taken to prevent the further influx of slaves into Bahrein. For these ends, I would recommend that a new agreement be taken from the Chiof arranging inter alia } («) for the registration of all existing domestic-born slaves in the islands and of others, over a certain age, if this concession is considered desirable ; and (b) for an efficient system of preventing the importation or re-enslaving of other negroes and Baluchis. I think also that the power to sell domestic slaves from one family to another should also be abolished. ^ 15. It will not be out of place here to mention that the fear of some action on the^e lines being instituted, as soon as the reformation of the Customs system shall be inaugurated, has always been one of the reasons for resistance displayed* by the Chief and his entourage to the proposal of the Government of India in connection with the Customs. I think it would be a good thing to show the people of Bahrein that&gt; while the Government of India j-till regard the slave question as seriously as of old, they do not wish in any way to allow it to be coupled with the other matter, and further that resistance in regard to the latter will be of no avail in a - matter, connected with which our world-famed policy is well understood.

Precis. In September 1895 some slaves owing to the presence of British Warships Residency Agent's letter No. 149, dated 30th m the harbour took the opportunity to September 1S95. apply for their freedom. A batch of six slaves apparently prior to the 24th September took refuge either at the Agency or on board H.M.S ' Pigeon,' and manumission papers from their respective owners were obtained through the Chief of Bahrein and copies were sent to the Bushire Residency, with a request for the usual-aKinumission papers signed by the Resident. In October two male and one female slaves also applied for freedom and Residency Agent's letter No. IS 2 i dated 8th Were dealt With Similarly, October 1895. . - On the closing of the pearling season in 1895, 31 slaves of both sexes took Residency Agent's letter Nj . ifio, dated 28th refuge at the Agency and, as usual, manu- October, page 13. mission papers were obtained for them from their owners through Sheikh Esa. Besides the above, three fugitive slaves from Katr took refuge at the Senior n tvai Officer's letter of 30th October Agency and the Commander of the '89s, pages 78 to 8a. «&lt; pig e on ' was asked to take them to Bushire as they could not be dealt with at Bahrein. When reporting the matter to the Resident the Commander suggested that it would save delay and expense if slaves from the mainfond could be released under Article 28 of the Brussels Have Trade Act when a man-of-war is present; later he reported that a large number of slaves w^re taking refuge at the Agency, and stated that he gathered from the Chiefs that most of the tribes possess considerable number of slaves who are exceedingly well treated, paid, clothed and fed and, entrusted with domestic arrangements, besides employed as pearl-divers, in fact treated more like paid servants then slaves ; that the immediate release of all would be a great hardship, liable to cause considerable discontent (as Arabs will not undertake menial work) and would also disorganise the pearling industry. He suggested that it would prevent discontent if emancipation were carried out by degrees. The Commander of the ' Pigeon' further reported that he was told by Mr. Gaskin that in consequence of the release of their slaves the Dowasir tribe con templated leaving the island ; and was similarly informed by the Chiefs uncle, who also explained that although up to date only three of the Dowasir slaves had been released all the remainder, perhaps 200, would apply for freedom. The Com mander impressed upon the uncle the foolishness of this step, laid stress on the benefits accruing from their residence in Bahrein and the disavantages met with on the mainland, and pointed out that before drastic measures were undertaken the Resident would fully consider the matter and that they should rely on the Resident's justice and judgment. The slaves referred to in the letter were not released but were allowed to ..... „ return to their owners after obtaining; a Vtde note in margin, pr .ge 84. . 1 1 • r 1 • r * written undertaking trom their owners for their future good treatment. The Resident in reply to the Commander of H. M. S. ' Pigeon ' re- Resideni's letter No. 587 17th November marked that it as not easy to come to 1895. pages 86 to 89. a decision as to any general practice to be followed in all cases, the position as it exists was complicated with several difficul ties, There was no undertaking on the part of Bahrein actually prohibiting slavery, the fact that importation was abjured 40 years ago should have resulted in existence of few domestic slaves, and the matter needed to be dealt with after iurther consideration. He stated in the meantime no wholesale manumission seemed expedient, or practically feasible, and the grant of freedom in cases of proved recent importation or of evident ill-treatment would meet all immediateJ . . 1 . L /j 8 requirements. He also remarked that he was not aware of any obstacle to fugitive slaves from the mainland on reaching one of His Majesty's ships being summarily freed according to the provisions of the Brussels Act. The Acting Residency Agent on nth November 1895, forwarded copies of Acting Residency Agent's letter No. 168 of tWO manumission papers glVCU by the 1 nh November 1905, pages 90and .I91. owners of slaves. He also reported that the masters of twelve others had refused to grant manumission papers and had threatened to leave the islands and that with a view to appease them it had been arranged with eight of the owners to give bonds binding themselves not to sell or give the slaves work beyond their abilities. The other four owners were absent irom Bahrein at the time. The Commander of the-ii-Pigeon ' reported on 24th November 1895, that he had been informed by the Acting Residency Agent that the Seyids of Hadd and Albu Felasa had launched their boats with the intention of leaving the island on account of the release of their slaves and the fear of punishment for refusing to give manumission papers and because of the taxes levied from them^ by Sheikh^Esa, and that he directed the Acting Residency Agent to induce Sheikh Esa to keep the people quiet till instructions were issued from the R'esi- dent, and that at that time 3 or 4 Albu Felasa boats had actually left, and that on receipt of Resident's letter No. 387 of 17th November 1895, he called the Chiefs together and explained to them that the release of all slaves was not contemp lated, but that any cases of fugitive slaves would be enquired into, and that recent importations and ill-treated slaves would be freed. He further reported that the tribesmen volunteered to give_ a written undertaking to Sheikh Esa that they will neither buy, sell or give away any slaves from that date; and that he informed them he would submit their offer to Resident j^and that the tribesmen further requested that cases-'of all ill-treatment or fugitive slaves might be enquired into by the She'kh and their manumission obtained- by him. The Resident approved of the Commander's action ; he observed that Resident 's er No. 621 of 14th December there would seem to be no objection to 1895, pages 101-102. the guarantee the heads^of tribes offer to give to Sheikh Esa, to abstain from all slave dealing and, if honestly carried out, would be a valuable gain to the cause of suppression of slavery, but that the suggestion that slave cases should be dealt with by Sheikh Esa, if intended to involve the exclusion of our intervention, could hardly be admitted. • In a letter dated ist December the Senior Naval Officer reported that -the tribes had settled down and hauled up Vtdt page 103. their boats again and that no more slaves have applied for freedom. (Enclosure 3.) P No. 69, dated, the 20th May 1900. From— J. C. G a SKIN , Esq., Political Assistant, Bahrein, To— C olonel C. A. K embal L, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that an African slave named Barood who took refuge at this Agency and subsequently returned to his master of his own accord on a guarantee for proper treatment in future, informed me on the 9th instant that slaves are occasionally imported into Hud, a village on the east coast of the lesser of the two Islands of Bahrein, and stated that either in January or February last, one named Saif bin Massabah brought a number of young raw slaves from the Pirate Coast and disposed of them to certain persons whom he named to me. I communicated the information to the Chief of Bahrein, and requested him to call upon these persons to produce the slaves and return them to his safe- custody until I received orders from you as to their disposal. The Chief informed me that he # caused them to appear before him and they all denied the truth of the allega'tion, and he promised* that if he traces any of the slaves he will secure them. But as the Chief, I believe, is inclined to screen |Vsubjects in such cases and may be anxious to avoid an exposure of the want of vigilance on his part, I appointed a day for these persons to appear examination by me in the presence of the Chief. I considered that if this course would prove nothing regarding the importation, it would however impress upon them the risks of future importations. They denied possessing raw slaves and all knowledge of such importations and were prepared to swear to the effect that those in their possession - were inherited by them and were domestic slaves. The people here are averse to giving information regarding slaves, being afraid of the Chief and the masters of the slaves doing them harm, I believe there are several raw slaves at Hud who may be traced if an offer of a small pre mium is secretly made for every bond fide case reported and the gratuity given may be paid out of a fine levied from the importer^pr masters. I think it would be useful as a check to direct the Chief of Bahrein to make public a notice to the effect that in future a fine of ^ igo will be imposed upon the owners for every slave imported, similar to the practice in force on the Pirate Coast when such cases come to the notice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

I have the honour to refer to my letter No. 191, dated the and June igoq with which I forwarded, by last mail, a translation of a letter from the Chief of Bahrein on the subject of his imaginary grievances. 2. Apart from the matter of the inaccuracy about the 'felling of the flag staff, ' I have tried on two occasions—first on the morning of the 2nd lune and once again subsequently-to convince the Chief that the ^ manPier in which he described his habit of rejecting sueh counsels of fhe Government of India as he tounr 3 unpleasmg would be likely to cause grave displeasure to Government 1 he last mail steamer stayed an unusually short time in this harbour and left *oon after mid-day. 1 was unable therefore to write more on this subject before the post closed. . 3-1 n j o y' k* g ; o report that with a view to getting the indiscreet letter recon^ sidered and if possible withdrawn, 1 worded my remonstrances in much stronger terms than (have used before—stronger even than those which you adonfed under orders from Government-though I do not think that 1 in any way exceeded the truth. 4. I reminded the Sheikh that in 1867 his uncle Mahomed bin Khalifa broke the terms of his agreement with Government, and in consequence the latter sent an expedition to punish him. They conquered the Islands and drove ^heikh Mahomed out. Subsequently, although they knew Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa (Sheikh Esa's father) to have also been in fault, they forgave him and made him Chief of Bahrein. 1 wo years later a rebellion broke out against Sheikh Ali which resulted in the latter's death, the flight of Sheikfl Esa and the assumption of the Chiefship by Mahomed bin Abdallah. The Government of India again sent an expedition here, defeated the sue- cessful rebels, brought Sheikh Esa back from Katar and installed him in the Chiefship. In 1873 Sheikh Esa offended the Government by his arbitrary con duct but subsequently made amends by apologizing and promising to consult and follow the advice of the British representatives in difficult questions in future Since then the Government have efficiently protected Sheikh Esa from the attacks of Nasir bin Mubarak and from interfering Turkish and Persian offiriak Generally, Sheikh Esa's attitude has been satisfactory, and when mistakes have been made he has not failed to submit to Government's orders. Recently how ever two cases have occurred in which Sheikh Esa has forgotten that it is his duty to accept the Resident's advice. A British force was sent here to exact compliance, and if he had shown resistance he would doubtless have been driven from Bahrein. -f He professed, however, to submit, and signed a written promise always future to fdlow the advice of Government. He also promised to use ' m t &amp; • f •-A 11 42 endeavours to effect Sheikh All's surrender and offered a large reward for his capture. I imagined, however, that Government would not be pleased at the fact of Sheikh Ali's being still at liberty when there was no doubt that the Chief could effect his capture, and 1 thought that the tone of his last letter would certainly add to their, displeasure. I further pointed out as I had often done before that if the case had been referred to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India a reply could hardly yet be expected. 5. The Chief replied that he liad been badly treated, that he*saw nothing objectionable in the tone of his letter and he expressly desired that I should not _ keep back the copy of it, which I had prepared to forward to you. 6. On the second occasion I suggested td the Chief that if he thought the written promise which had been extorted from him was unjust, would it not be better lor him to address Government separately on the subject and in a more conciliatory tone, stating the grounds for his view ? I also suggested that in such a letter he might express the hope that nothing In his letter of the 30th May would give offence. The Chief repeated that he could not agree with me that there was anything offensive in what he had written, and that if Governhietft considered that there was and called upon him for an explanation it woukl be - time enough then to give one. 7. At the moment of my taking leave the Chief relaxed his attitude to the extent of saying that he would consult his son Hamad further on the subject. As, however, Sheikh Hamad passed me on his way to Manama for a few days' stay, when I was going to Muharraq, and did this in spite of my having given the Chief previous notice of my intended visit, I do not think that any result will be apparent from this consultation when it does take place. 8. The explanation of the Chief's unreasonable attitude lies, doubtless, in the fact that he is being continually pestered bv Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed,^ who is supported by all the younger members of the family, with requests for permis sion to come back to Bahrein and threats tojnvolve the Chief in further trouble if'his case is not soon satisfactorily settled.* On Monday last, the 5th Instant, the Chief sent his son Hamad to me with an urgent message that he had received news from Katar that Sheikh Ali had made up his mind to return to Bahrein. I asked Sheikh Hamad whether Sheikh Ali was thinking of attacking Manama or of surrendering himself to the Chief. Sheikh Hamad replied that he did not think he intended to adopt either of these courses; he was tired of his uncomfortable exile in Katar and merely wished to live quietly and secretly in some out-of-the w r ay place in Bahrein. I told Sheikh Hamad that it was ^ood news that Sheikh Ali was contemplating a return to Bahrein, and if he could be induced to submit himself to the orders of Government such a conclusion would be most satisfactory. If he came without any such intention, it should not be at all difficult for the Chief to cut oif his retreat and to make him a prisoner. I added that if Sheikh Ali did return to Bahrein and succeeded in escaping again later, the Government of India would certainly take very serious notice of the matten Sheikh Hamad replied that ' Inshallah,' Sheikh Ali would not come. Sheikh Esa was doing his best to dissuade him, as nobody in Bahrein would be f«und willing to capture Sheikh Ali, and it was recognized that his coming here in safety would be injurious to the Chief's interests. 9. At the close of this interwiew the thought occurred to me that possibly Sheikh Ali had already landed in Bahrein. My Munshi conceived the same suspicion, and on the following day he was told by a respectable Arab that Sheikh All was actually at Jasera at the southern end of the island. I am trying to get confirmation of this report, but am inclined'to think that it is not correct as nothing, fresh has transpired durng the last two days.* • A liter demi-offlcial commuaicatioo states that the report referred to was found to bave no foundation* P.

'Lawrence' for the present, pending Government's decision as to their domicile, . 2. . For your information, I will now proceed to give ; a brief resume of the facts, as disclosed by telegrams which have passed between this office and the Government of India, since Sheikh Ali's surrender;~ On the 2nd. August, I informed' Government of the arrival here on H.Ti. S. 'Sphinx' of JSheikh Ali and party, and further,that if delay in decision as to. destination was likely, Muskat would be the best place for then to wait. Sheikh Ali and servants being allowed to go on shore, the four 'rowdies' being retained on board. Replying on the 7th. August, Foreign T)epartinent asked wiiab income ^heiich Ali would dispose of, and observed that it was understood that there was no question of this 'income ooing supplemented by Government; further, that his domicile - would depend on his income, and that he and his foiloxvers sh )ald await a decision at ..laskat or Bushire,as I should think best, some delay in making arrangements- being inevit- -able. i - H On the 10th. August, I informed Foreign 'Department «.t any contribution towards Sheikh Ali's maintenance waswas in my opinion unnecessary and had not been contenplat- ed-that when in Bahrein^he was understood to have enjoyed property and perquisites bringing in Es 15,000/- per annun&gt; but that with regard to landed property. Sheikh Esa held that his nephew was only the tenant for life; that the_ simplest plan would be to leave Sheikh Ali's property on trust with Sheikh Esa and call upon the latter to pay you, as Political Agent, a regular monthly allowance for trans mission to bhe exile, and that for this' purpose I consi- probably . . dered a sum of Es 300/- per month would A 3Uffice ; and that meanwhile I had some Es 5,000/- odd in cash ; which could be_ utilised; but that on this point I should like to consult youj[i»e.- as to the amount at which his monthly allowance might be fixed ). ' „ On 18th August, Foreign Department advised me that they were consulting the Bombay Government regarding cost of board and lodging for Sheikh Ali and party &gt; at Bombay and Aden respectively, in order to enable me to fix the amount of the requisite allowance. It was further observe'd^ that it seemed unnecessary and expensive to send the four surrendered 'rowdies' with Sheikh Ali; If considered ad- • visable, he might be permitted to select one or two coi5- panions, but as to the others and the six not yet surren- • dered, I was asked to submit proposals, in the event of my considering the Ultimatum sentences worthy of modification. In conclusion. Government observed that should Sheikh Ali send for his family, hereafter, it must be entirely at hi./ own expense, and asked to be informed of my recommendation regarding his brother Mahomed. I had already discussed the above points with Sheikh • • # Ali on his first arrival,and he then argued that as his brother and four culprits had spontaneously followed him, Arab tradition would not allow him to dismiss them,and he would prefer to bear their expenses. At a later inter- view, on explaining that I had no doubt that Sheikh Ali could be visited from time to time by his brother,- whilein exile, 'the latter elected 'to re'turn 'to Bahrein and after Ali's family affairs. As regards the four 'rowdiesJ I recommended Govern- ' ment on 22nd August &gt; to give them 6 months incarceration in ^ India^and then to set them free, when they might be sent back to Bahrein, the expenses of incarceration and return fare being debited to Sheikh Ali's account, should Govern ment so wish* 3# I now have the honour to invite an expression of your views regarding the care of Ali's property during his ab sence, and regarding the method to be employed in recover- ing his monthly allowance. As to the former, I do not think subject to hearing your views,that it would be expedient to take any course which would raiseawkward questions -o£ title in his absence. As regards the latter, it is I think advisable,that we should receive payment through Sheikh « Esa no matter by whom -the absentee's property is managed, but on this point I shall be glad to learn your views. *. * Also with regard to the remaining six truants from justice, do you recommend any definite terms being offer ed to them if they give themselves up, or that the matter • so far as they are concerned should be left wher0 it is?

From M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E. Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M. F raser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, 1 have the honour to forward copies of the letters marginally noted, addressed Political Agent, Bahrein, to Resident, Nos. 204 to me by the Political Agent, Bahrein, on a tS'ft e aP„miJai n A6. 9 „tBahrein, No. .006, receiving a copy of Foreign Department dated 16th July 1905. letter No. 1873-E. B., dated 17th May 1905. A copy of my reply to Government to the latter communication had not then reached him. My letter No. 781 to which he also refers, covered my written message of 7th June for delivery to the Sheikh. A copy of it was-forwarded to Government with my No. 259 of 1 ith June. 2. Now that the Government of India have at Bahrein a Political represent ative of some standing and experience, I take for granted that they would wish, especially at the present juncture when the affairs of Bahrein are sub judice, to be placed-ln possession of his views first hand in all Important matters, irrespective of the question whether the Resident can entirely endorse them or not. It is on this supposition that I submit his present communication for consideration. 3. After a careful scrutiny of his recommendations I am inclined to think that the Political Agent's zeal for reform has a tendency to carry him too fast and too far, and that his present proposals are mainly of a nature which is only compatible with a declared and effective British Protectorate. In their letter No. 1873-E. B. to which Captain Prideaux's present com munication (No. 204) refers, the Government of India explained to me with some emphasis that they had set their, face- against any such extreme measure as being altogether opposed to the policy of His Majesty's Government. They went on to express the view that they might reasonably hope that such other reforms as were necessary would be brought about by the gradually increasing personal influence of the Political Agent. The declaration of a Protectorate being out of the question, I fully concurred with the Government of India that as soon as coercive measures were held to have come to an end, our only course was to rely on the personal influence and friendly advice of our Political Agent to further our policy in other respects. When replying on this point in my letter No. 244, dated 14th June, I ventured to indicate the nature which that influence must in my opinion possess in order to have any chance of success. 4. Apart from such further reforms as this dominant influence may be able to bring about in the future, I doubt if there is any middle course open to us between the extreme ones of treating Bahrein {a) as a British Protectorate, and (^) as an independent principality. I grant that if King Log does not give satisfaction there is presumably nothing to prevent us from^ changing him for King Stork, but it seems to me that we cannot at one minute insist that the Ruler is an Independent sovereign and expect him to assume responsibility as such (as we did in connection with the Fracls-Times lawsuit arising out of the f&lt; Baluchistan ' seizure, vide the cor- Office,^nesp^tfh^No^V^ecre^iated^'-th 1 March respondence marginally noted), and at 1899 to Government of India and previous corre- another treat him like a petty Indian Raja spcndence. and intervene in his internal administration to the extent suggested by Captain Prideaux. Lest I should appear at all inconsistent in making these observations, I would reiterate here that the reforms advocated in my letter No. 123 ,dated 1 ith March 1505,.were proposed essentially as component items of our punitive mea sures against the Sheikh, at a time when I doubted whether Government would consider those already taken as sufficient. Since then several months have elapsed . H f ■ - j • -t 4• i * &gt; v • « A y ^1' but If any of these measures can In the opinion of Government still be forced the Sheikh before the Chapter is considered closed, so much the better. I gather however from the concluding sentence of paragraph 3, letter No. 1873^ above referred to, that this is probably not the case. 5. Until I know how far the Government of India concur in the views expressed above it seems of little use my entering into a detailed discussion regarding the several matters touched upon in the Political Agent's present com munications. Moreover his letter No. 204 covers so much ground that I feel it difficult to handle it satisfactorily in a single communication and therefore limit myself to such comment, in a separate memorandum, as it seems desirable to forward simultaneously with this letter. 6. I may mention however before concluding, with reference to paragraph 27 of the Political Agent's letter No. 204, that if the passage which I have enclosed in a red ink parenthesis be eliminated for the present, I see no objection to the Political Agent being authorised to make a communication to the Chief in the sense of the rest of the paragraph if the Government of India do not consider that this has not already been made fully clear to him in the ultimatum presented to him on 25th February 1905. * . Memorandum of comment upon details of Political Agent's letter No. 204, dated 24th June 1905. / Paragraphs 3 to 10. —Captain Prideaux here sets down not his own views but a statement of what he believes would be Sheikh' Esa's if the latter could pat them into shape. Paragraph //.—In his remarks regarding t*he Bahrein Customs the Political Agent writes 'the state of affairs here differs very greatly from that at Muscat' but he does not explain how it differs, and I find it difficult to agree with his conclusions in the last part of this paragraph, his allusion to the British National Debt seeming inappropriate. The cases of Bahrein and Muscat appear to me to be precisely the same. In neither case is there any national administration or national account. In both cases the Ruler administers the state as a private concern, for himself; he renders account to no one and, so far as my experience goes, keeps no account. There is nothing to prevent him if he chooses, so long as he gives his regular employes something on account occasionally, from spending his whole income for the year in the purchase of a large pearl or a private steam yacht. In both cases the Rulers have always been heavily In debt to some Banian usurer, usually the Customs farmer because he will lend easiest. We may call such a loan an advance on the Customs revenue, if we wish, and it Is true that as long as the ' farmer ' is not changed the debt may continue to be carried over with the addition of plentiful interest from one year to another, but the moment another Banian intervenes, or is brought in by the Sheikh, his draft on the last one becomes just as much a private debt as money borrowed from any other Shroff. The Sultan of Muscat up to the time I left was much hampered by, old debts of this kind. still paying off, and was Except that the Sheikh of Bahrein Is better off and spends a smaller por tion of his income on his Bedouin friends than does Seyyid Feisal, the two cases seem precisely parallel. Paragraph /5.--T0 ordain that all aggrieved persons should be considered to have a right of appeal to the Political Agent against the Sheikh would in my opinion be incompatible with the Sheikh's independence and the ordinance could only be worked under a full British Protectorate, internal as well as external. I am sure we should yery soon and very frequently be brought to an impasse if we attempled to institute such a doctrine under the existing regime.w &gt; | Paragraphs iy and 28. Reform of % Revenue Administration and institution of Record of Rights. —The remarks recorded in reference to paragraph 15 above apply to these reforms also except in so far as the Political Agent's influence can induce Sheikh Esa to improve the existing state of things of his own accord. Paragraph 18. The Bedouin scourge.—These Arab Chieftains cannot be expected quickly to change their ^ ancestral and traditional ideas of which the distribution of largesse to adherents is one of the most firmly rooted. Every one of them, be it the Sultan of Muscat or the Sheikh of Koweit, the Pirate Coast Chiefs or any other influential Chief in the Arabian Peninsula, likes to be thought a modern Haroun-al-Rashid and spends a large slice of his income in subsiding the Bedouins whom he believes to be friendly to him. Sheikh Esa's oft quoted reason is that these people whom he periodically entertains are tribesmen, or the relations of tribesmen, who were kind to him man^ years ago when he fell on troublous times and was an exile in Katr. By all means let the Political Agent do all he can to induce the Sheikh to keep these people away as much as pos sible, but here again it would be difficult to forbid them altogether nor would it seem advisable to issue an official prohibition without adequate means of enforc ing rt., i think the case could be met for the present by the police arrangements recommended for Manama being instituted. There would then be reasonable hope of keeping the Bedouins out of Manama or under control. Paragraph /p.—The Slavery question has already been treated in a sepa rate communication. Paragraph 23.— Awe is no doubt a good feeling for the Political Agent to inspire among tbe Sheikh's petty retainers, but in the case of Sheikh Esa himself the sentiment must be tempered by confidence if the result is to be satisfactory. Paragraph 24. —For a Vazier I recommend new blood altogether. Any member of the Sheikh's entourag'e would be handicapped by the influence of his friends and surroundings. Paragraph 22. —Sheikhs Hamed and Khalifa to be ordered to tour in India, the former for at least a year, and in the event of his refusal his recognition to be withdrawn and Khalifah recognised in his place. Having just made a pronouncement to Sheikh Hamed regarding his future conduct, we can hardly offer him an ultimatum in this sense in the absence of any further delinquency on his part. A less lengthy tour would I think be an excellent thing for him, but he would require to have an Indian or English offi cial with him and I fear that long before the year was out he would become an expensive white-elephant to the Government of India. The boy Khalifah on the other hand after being once lodged at school should give little further trouble. Paragraph 55.—The formation of a small police force of 50 men for the maintenance of order in the Manama Bazaar is a comparatively simple thing, but the maintenance of a small standing army of 300 men for protection purposes is a much more ambitious undertaking. I quite agree that the entertainment of such a force would be a more satisfactory means of keeping Bahrein free from attack than the annual waste of 56,000 rupees in subsidies, but the idea is opposed to Arab traditions and I fear that except under a new Chief or a Protec torate it is useless to think of it. Paragraph 2g. —Captain Prideaux's observations in this paragraph regard ing the administration of the Customs by Sheikh Esa himself are no doubt based on my written message to the Sheikh of June 7th of which a copy was forwarded to Government. The allusions to the Customs question included therein were simply made in order not to miss the opportunity afforded to me by Sheikh Esa of introducing the topic ; but while referring to the benefits which the Muscat Customs had derived from the withdrawal of the administrations from the Hindoo 'farmers', I was careful to safeguard my remarks by saying that the resumption of the Bahrein ' farm ' from the hands of the Banians would be a big undertaking and that Government would require very full guaran tees for the efficient conduct of the administration. Among these I would natural- m fi • ♦ \ # • • • • fi y • r • 4lv include selection and approval of the Superintendent chosen and the period ^ leal auditing of accounts. 1 gather from the Political Agent's paragraph under reference that he considers that Sheikh Esa apparently recognises our intervention in the case of injustice or outrage inflicted on persons whom we protect or are interested in, as being a natural proceeding ag^nst which he can bring forwad ^ no reasonable arguments, but that he places the Customs question in a ditfere category and suspects in our advances in connection therewith an attempt to en croach upon his sovereign rights. The Political Agent does not, however, teem to give sufficient weight to the fact : that the readjustment of the Customs Administration may be fairly included in the category of important and necessary reforms - with respect of which, if he pretends as he does to regard us as benevolent friends and not designing enemies, he is bound to listen to our friendly advice and in regard to which his frequent vacillation and exhibition of bad faith cannot be tolerated. Moreover, the importance to our trade and political interests of being in a posi tion to assure ourselves that the fiscal administration of Bahrein is reasonably efficient, and by means of it of being able to exercise some supervision and- con-^ trol over his finances generally, is just as paramount to ourselves as it is in the best interests of the Sheikh. No. 20^ dated Bahrein, the 24th June 1905. p rom —Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 781, dated the nth June 1905, and to refer also to letter No. 1873-E. B., dated the 1 7th May 1905, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign De partment to your address, a copy of which I have received from you in advance of the other papers referred to in the 2nd paragraph of your letter under reply. 2. The message in Arabic which I have received from you - for communica tion to the Chief of Bahrein was duly read out to Sheikh Isa by my Munshi in my presence at Muharraq on the afternoon of the 20th instant. Sheikh Hamad was present at the interview and on the conclusion of the conversation on the subject of your message, I delivered to him the warning from the Governmeot of India that their ultimate acquiescence in his succession would depend entirely on his satisfactory demeanour from this time forward. Sheikh Hamad acknowledged the message briefly with the remark that he hoped always to be favoured with the approbation of Government, and Sheikh Isa tried to make excuses for his son by taking upon himself the responsibility for all the latter's actions. With regard to your own written message Sheikh Isa gave me to understand that he still hoped the Government of India would be more merciful in their decision about Sheikh Ali ; He promised also not to trouble us further on the subject pending thj receipt of that decision. The proposal that Sheikh Khalifa should be sent to India was not mooted, as I did not consider the occasion to be suitable. 3. With regard to the observations contained in Mr. Eraser's letter No. 1873-E. B. of &amp; the 17th May 1905, and before I submit my specific replies I beg to lay before you the views held by the Chief of Bahrein, on the question of his position towards the Government of India, so far as I have been able to ascertain them from the disjointed and far from clear remarks he has let fall from time to time. 4. In 1861 a Convention was entered into between the Independent Ruler of • Bahrein and a representative of the British Government, in which it was arranged that so long as the former abstained from certain acts disapproved by the British Government, the latter would support the Chief of Bahrein against the aggres sions of the Chiefs and tribes of'the Persian Gulf.5- Subsequently, in the years 1873 to 1875 the Chief was very anxious to assert his claims to certain possessions outside of Bahrein, and he was repeatedly told that if he did not follow the advice of the Government of India to keep clear of all entanglements with the Turks, Wahabis, etc., on the mainland, the Govern ment at India would not protect him from the consequences of his acts. 6. In these two cases it seems that the feasibility of the Sheikh's throwing off the protection of the Indian Government was fully existent. 7. This position was, however, modified by the agreements of 1880 and 1802, under which the Chief bound himself not to enter into negotiations with any other Government than the British, not to accept the Agencies of such Governments and not to alienate any of his territories to foreigners without the consent of the British Government. On their part, the Government of India did not assume any fresh obligations, but the various occasions on which they have protected the Chief of Bahrein diplomatically against States other than the tribes of the Persian Gulf may be set off against the benefits conferred upon us under these Agreements. .8. As a corollary to these two Agreements which relate only to the Chief's foreign relations, the right of the Government of India to protect all foreigners in Bahrein was subsequently asserted and established. 9. In 1901, at the special request of Sheikh Isa, the Government of India consented to recognize Sheikh Hamed as the heir to the Chiefship, and this is the only recorded instance in which the Government have taken cognizance of a purely internal matter affecting the principality. 10. The Chief feels strongly that the alteration of his Customs System without his approval is an infringement of his internal sovereign rights which he must resist to the utmost extent of kis capability, and it is this feeling alone, I am convinced, which actuates him in his misguided attitude. The reasons which cause his advisers and associates to oppose the reform are various and purely selfish. 11. At this point I wiH venture to refer to the resources of Bahrein and the manner in which the proposition to reform the Customs originally arose. The Sheikh's follows:— f ... * « .. t present revenues are estimated—very roughly—to be as Rs. From Customs ... 1,50,000 )} Date gardens ... 1,00,000 » Pearling-boats ... ... ,,, 8,000 }i Judicial Fees (Khidmah) Succession Duties, etc. (at 10 percent.) ... ... 20,000 »» Town lands, shops and Khans 14,000 M Miscellaneous sources including Secret Ex tortions 8,000 Total Rs. 3,00,000 His expenses are Personal, including Body-guard's salaries Abnormal expenses imarriages, journeys, etc.) Family allowances Administration expenses ... Subsidies and presents to Bedouin 1,00,000 30,000 1,00,000 14,000 56,000 • c? - t J -T ' 'i . •' I » ft: •: 1- N * The income and expenditure are made closely to correspond. In bad years, retrenchments can undoubtedly be made by the cutting down of allowances and presents, and the fact that the Sheikh has received some two lakhs of Rupees in advances from the Customs-farmers bears no more heavily on him while his power to periodically sell the farm is uncontrolled than does the British National Debt on ourselves. The total of the Chief's private debts is insignificant—some Rs. 25,000, The state of affairs here, therefore, differs very greatly from that of Maskat. E12. With regard to the origin of the Customs reformation proposal, I only write from memory, as the records of this office commence from 1900, but if I am not mistaken^ the proposal was made on the Chiefs affirming, in his charact eristic insincere manner, that he could not afford some trifling expenditure—it was probably the enhancement of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed's allowance. The Maskat Customs question at that time was occupying much of Colonel Meade's attention, and the real position at Bahrein not being properly known, it was natural for him to suggest that the same reform should be introduced into Bahrein as into Maskat. . 13. I am most anxious that Government should not think that I have failed to realize the advantages that will accrue to the Chief of Bahrein by the introduction of the new system, and you are aware, I think that I have conti nuously done my best to make Sheikh Isa see the matter in the same light. At the same time with my increasing knowledge of affairs here I have lately been coming round to the opinion that there are two other reforms of immeasu- reably greater importance, which should be first introduced, and that while the Customs question is by no means to be forgotten it may conveniently for a little time be allowed to subside into the back grofind. • ^4. The two abuses, which I wish to see reformed, are (/) the cruelties inflicted upon the Sheikh's own subjects by the al-Khalifa family, the Magisterial and Revenue Officials and the Kazis, and {it) the objectionable welcome which is extended every summer to hordes of Bedouin who, coming from Hasa as^well as from Katar, are fed at the Sheikh's expense and in addition are permitted to commit a variety of crimes and to harass the townspeople of Manama without the slightest check. 15. The protection from foreign States which the Chief receives from us is_ neither more nor less, it seems to me, than that which the Government of India extend to the Native States in India. In the latter all persons have the privilege of appealing to the local Political Officer against acts of oppression, and I submit that the same right should exist here. My predecessor regulated his conduct more on the pattern of a consular officer in Persia than of an Indian Political Officer, and I have consequently hitherto refused to entertain the com plaints of Bahrein subjects, though such are constantly being presented to me. 16. The most common forms of oppression are the selling, over and over again, the same plots of ground by different servants of the Chief in the latter's * name, the arbitrary resumption of date-gardens on the deaths of the original cultivators, the flagrant and almost continual acts of injustice committed by the Kazis in succession cases, and the exercise of ' Sukhra ' which the Chief has himself formally repudiated in a letter to me. 1 7. Whilst these acts of tyranny are constantly recurring it seems incongruous that we should be endeavouring to add a lakh and a half annually to the Sheikh's income without any conditions as to the expenditure of the money, and I feel that a little unfettered supervision and an occasional investigation into alleged irregularities will have such an effect on the Chief's revenue that, taken into consideration with the present reduction of his income for the next 2^ years of a lakh per annum—the advance money which the Customs Farmers are no longer paying for renewals of the farm—he will soon find himself against his will compelled to turn to Government for pecuniary assistance —a step which he hasnever yet seriously taken—and then will come our opportunity to dictate terms, when we can press for the reform not only of the Customs bat also of the Land Revenue Administration, the income from which I am certain is capable of being not only doubled but multiplied many times over. 18. With regard to the Bedouin scourge, the scandal was first brought to the notice of Government in a letter from the Native News Agent at Bahrein to the address of the Political Resident on the 9th September 1889. Since those days I am informed that the annual invasion has rather increased than dimi nished. The Chief entertains a fatuous idea that in time of pressing danger, his kindness will be repaid by the tribesmen flocking to his assistance, but as all tne tribes of Hasa are nominally subject to the Turks—the nomads being subsidized and the partially-settled sections occasionally paying revenue—is'in more likely in my opinion that they would be found on the side of the Sheikh's aggres sors than of himself. On the one occasion when the value of the Bedouin's services might have been tested—in 1895, in connection with the threatened invasion of Bahrein by Nasir Lin Mubarak and Jasim bin Thani—the Sheikh preferred to appeal for the assistance of the Government of India. 19. The Slavery question is a third matter in which I think a different line of conduct is called for on the part of the Bahrein Authorities, and in which we may justifiably take stronger action than hitherto, but I have nothing to add to my representations on this subject, made in my letter No, 17J, dated the 26th May 1905, to which I respectfully invite a reference. 20. To return now to Mr. Eraser's letter No. 1873-E.B., I first beg to assure you that the effect of the recent demonstration, so far as the officials, the nobles and the unruly element of the population are concerned, has had the most desirable results, and there is little likelihood of a foreigner being again molested for some time to come, or of his failing to receive redress if unfortunately he should suffer anything at the hands of the Sheikh's subjects. The public, however, are aware that the Government of India's demands have not been complied with in full, and they are awaiting the issue with consi derable curiosity and interest. 21. The recommendations which you have submitted to Government regarding the appointment of a selected VVazir, the delegation to an Indian Officer of the task of evolving an efficient police force, and the education of Sheikh Khalifa in India are all matters, I believe, which you contemplated imposing upon the Chief as punishments or substituted demands in consequence of his failure to surrender Sheikh Ali. You recognized that the Chief would dislike each one of these measures quite as much as he dislikes the Customs proposal, placing all in the same category as interferences with his internal sovereign rights, but it was hoped that the Government of India and His Majesty's Secretary of State would see less objection on general political grounds in the acceptance of one or more of these suggestions than in the proposal (which was decisively negatived) to include in our Ultimatum the immediate reformation of the Customs. 22. Tne lightest of the 3 suggested demands is probably the third one, and as Sheikh Hamad is still the most likely successor to Sheikh Isa, I now venture to recommend that in consequence of the non-surrender of Sheikh AH, the Chief should be ordered to send both Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Khalifa to India for at least a year, to tour amongst the principal Native States as well as other places of importance under careful supervision. The retention of Khalifa for a longer period could perhaps be subsequently arranged, and if Sheikh Hamad refuses to comply with this demand I would recommend that his recognition as heir-apparent be formally annulled, and Khalifa be recognized in his place. It is possible th t the Chief may object to let his son and grandson go on the score of nis old age, but while 1 would not admit this excuse in the case of Sheikh Hamad, whose narrow-mindedness in my opinion can only be corrected by a course of foreign travel, we could attain almost the same good results that we desire in the case of8 - Khalifa If we simply provided him with a suitable native tutor (either Egyptian or Indian) as soon as he was recognized as heir to the Chiefship, and arranged for his making shorter tours later on or even after his accession. 23. As regards Mr. Eraser's references to myself and my position, I sincerely believe that my post is now regarded with a considerable increase of awe, judging by the attentions shown to me by the Bazaar-masters of both Manama and Muharraq, and other notabilities of the Islands. The Chief, too, has invariably listened to my remonstrances in the petty matters which I have had occasion to brings before him. I cannot however- -overlook the fact that Sheikh Isa and his family now entertain the deepest suspicion regarding the pacific system of penetration which they believe is to be inaugurated^by the reformatian of the Customs, and the fact that I was so closely connected with the coercive measures that have recently been adopted is, I fear, not one that tends to give them confidence in the genuineness of my friendship. It will be up-hill work to overcome this feeling, and in the meanwhile I hope the Government of India will not press for the introduction of re r orms which we cannot claim to be entitled to on explicit (i'.e., jtreaty) grounds. 24. With regard to the suggestion about a selected Wazir, the local candidate is a first-cousin of the present incumbent, and is at present styled Wazir to Sheikh Hamed. If this man accompanies Sheikh Hamed to India, it may perhaps later on be found that there is no great objection to his eventually succeeding to the post. 25. As to the re-organization of the Police force, it may perhaps be possible later on to convince the Chief that the permanent maintenance of such a force would be an infinitely greater source of strength than the wild Bedouin on whom he at present affects to rely, and that *if he had 200 or 300 disciplined men, to protect and reinforce the ordinary population of the Islands when threat ened with Bedouin attacks, he could easily do without the assistance of our men-of-war, 26. I do not advise that this matter be broached with the Chief, until aftec Government have decided in favour of forbidding the ingress of the Bedouin hordes to Bahrein, and only then after the Chief has himself raised the question as to how he is to protect his islands in the absence of his Bedouin. 27. Briefly to recapitulate the policy which I recommend, I think that the Chief should be firmly told that though hitherto the Government of India .have abstained from interfering in or noticing matters which concern only the Chief and his subjects, they cannot permit the protection which they give him to be used as a shelter from which he may tyrannize over and ill-treat his subjects without let or hindrance, as thereby an undesired stigma is liable to become attached to the Government's name. [The Political Agent therefore has been given orders to take notice of all cases of injustice by whomsoever and on whomsoever committed in Bahrein and to press for the offenders' punishment j besides this it is his duty to see that all Treaty obligations are rigorously obser- ed by the Chief's subjects] ; on their part, the Government, while of course maintaining their right to offer friendly advice for the increased welfare of the Chief and his subjects on every matter which comes before them, are quite ready to leave undiminished the internal sovereign rights of the Chief, where they do not involve the Government of India in dishonour. 28. If this policy is approved, I am confident that the Sheikh's faith in our bona fides will soon return, whilst at the same time I shall be given numerous opportunities of striking at his evil advisers, and exposing their misdeeds. When the opportunities for making money by illegal methods contract, the demands on all sides for increased allowances and salaries will arise, and .the Chief will at last find himself really pressed for money. W'ithin the next two years—that is, before the Bunniahs' customs contract expires—I anticipate that Sheikh Isa will feel the necessity for applying to Government earnestly for assistance. Iwould even recommend that we should exhibit no signs of eagerness to fall in with the Chief's wishes, and if we could then contrive to get the Land Revenue Administration reformed and a proper Record of Rights made up at the same time as we revise the Customs Administration, we should be conferring an in estimable boon upon the whole rural population and would be paving the way for an enormous immigration of the cultivating class from all parts of the Gulf. It is well known that in ancient times a very much larger portion of the main island was cultivated than at the present day, and I believe that bj means of artesian wells, the sub-terranean river which is said to come to the surface ac the northern end of Bahrein in the shape of innumerable springs, could probably be tapped almost all over the island. 29. It is inevitable, I suppose, if the contract system of the Customs Ad ministration is to be abolished, that the Chief should be allowed, if he still insists on it, to attempt the administration himself, but it is certain that when such a time comes not only will the revenue from this source diminish, but the unfortunate merchants of Bahrein will continually be harassed with all manner of troubles. The diminution of the Customs revenue of course will expedite the course of the Chief towards bankruptcy, but if he insists upon his right to renew the contract with the Hindus can we legitimately object, if the claim to independence in internal affairs is conceded? Under the present system we cannot urge that injustice is done to any individuals, for the only real sufferer is the Chief himself, and a large number of other influential persons undoubtedly profit as they are able to extort special concessions from the Farmers which they would not receive from a State-managed Department. Even, however, if we allow such a contention of the Chief's, I am hopeful that when the relations between himself and the Political Agent have become established on a more confidential footing, he will eventually allow himself to be persuaded to submit the desired application to Government.* No. 205, dated Bahrein, the 24th June 1905. From — C aptain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In my letter No. 133, dated the 22nd April 1905 I described the system under which mercantile disputes between parties of different nationalities are settled in Bahrein. I now have the honour to inform you that when the occasion arose a 1 L ., . « , _ . t . 1 t-j . . * T . few weeks ago for the assembly of a *Muqbil al Duker and Abdul Kanman bin idan. nc m* i . i • i n* J - ^ Mejhs to hear a case, to which a Hindu and a Baharani were parties, the two most influential Arab Merchants* of Manama whom I first summoned to the Court, excused themselves from sitting on the plea, that the decision of a Mejlis on which they had previously sat a few months ago had been over-ridden by the Chief of Bahrein and gross injustice had been perpetrated in consequence. 2, The case to which the merchants referred was convened by the Chief and assembled at the agency for the purpose of winding up the affairs of a lead ing Baharani Pearl-merchant, Syed Khalaf whose monetary difficulties and in debtedness to certain Persian Merchants had formed the subject of correspond ence between your office and that of the Bushire Karguzar for many years past, and who after getting his debts compounded and liabilities reduced on more than one occasion had at last died, leaving as has since been ascertained a considerable fortune for the benefit of his heirs. 3. The particulars of the case are given in the petition I have received from the widow of Syed Khalaf. and a translation of her statement is appended. It is only necessary to explain that no exception is taken to any of the proceedings of the Chief until after the time when the Mejlis had completed its work, the Per sian, Hindu and Baharani creditors had been paid and the two packages of pearls and ornaments valued at Rs. 57,000 and Rs. 3,000 had been respectively lodged with Ramoh (Pitamberdas) and Muqbil al Duker for temporary safe-custody. '1 heacts of oppression consist In the orders Issued by the Chief to summarily deliver up to his nominees the two packets held by Ramoh and Muqbil and in the fact that from that date the heirs have been unable to recover the values of the packets or even to ascertain for certain whether they have been received by the Chief from Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab and Syed Nasir or not. It is common ly believed that Sheikh Isa himself has realized the price of the pearls and the value of the ornaments and has converted the money to his own use, in consequen ce of his having failed to obtain his customary annual advance of money from the Customs Farmers, but I think it is possible that the two dishonest debtors of the estate have also profited in perhaps paying the Chief lesser sums than those which the Mejlis fixed upon the two packets. 4. As the late Syed Khalaf was a subject of the Chief of Bahrein, under the precedents in this office his h^irs would not ordinarily receive assistance from me, but in my letter No. 204 of to-day's date I have asked permission to take cogni zance of all such cases as this in the future. I am told by my advisers that this case of tyranny is rather an exceptional one, and that the Chief does not often rob the widow and the fatherless- in such open and extensive fashion, though his servants are less scrupulous than hrmselL: 5. The further consideration also attaches to this case that, when the verdict of the Mejlis was given from this Agency, it is humiliating to ourselves that any party to the case should be so grossly ill-treated. Popular opinion is strong on the subject, as is evinced by the action of the two merchants Muqbil and Abdul Rahman, and moreover if justice is not speedily given, I anticipate that consider able general inconvenience will result from the members of the Mejlis following the example of their two Arab leaders. 6. In these circumstances, I solicit ypur permission to take up this case against the Chief and the two debtors at once, without waiting for the decision of Government on the general principle involved. Translation of the Petition of Mussammat Shaha, daughter of Salman Bin Rajah, widow oj Syed Khalaf Bin Syed Isa, dated jolk Rahi althmi (13th of June igos) Bahrein. My husband, Syed Khalaf, died in my father's house (where I still live) on the 27th of the month of Safar, 1322 Hijri. He left no heirs to his property except myself and my two sons, Syed Saad and Syed Khalaf, and another son, Syed Isa, by a second wife who died before her husband. On my request my father and Syed Nasir, cousin of my husband, went to Muqbil AlDukher, and informed him that the house of the deceased Syed Khalaf was occupied by certain people, that it contained certain valuables, and that I was very much afraid lest these be removed unauthorizedly from the house. Muqbil found it advisable to lock up all such places where there were effects and to stamp the locks with the seal of the deceased. 3 or 4 days afterwards the Ban ians appeared before Mr. Gaskin and informed him of the affixing of locks and seals by Muqbil. Some days later Sheikh Isa Bin Ali thought of laving open the locks and sealed apartments, of seeing what valuables they contained,_ of taking out these and putting them in the custody of Ramoh Banian and taking receipt thereof. His orders were executed by the late Sharidah, his clerk {Note— and in the presence of the Agency Munshi Haji Abbas). Later on Sheikh Isa found that my deceased husband owed money to several people, and he with drew the pearls from the custody of Ramoh to be valued in the presence of ex perts. The following were present in the house of Ganga Ram on the occasion of the valuation of pearls :— 1. Muqbil AlDukher. 2. Mohammad Bin Abdal Wahab. 3. Syed Ulwi Bin Syed Jawwad. 4. Musaid Bin Khalifa. *5. Vishan Das, Banian. foThe pearls were valued and returned to the custody of Ramoh but Sheikh Isa took money in advance from Ramoh (Rs. 10,000) as his share of ' khidma' (judicial fee or succession duty) before the pearls were sold and the case decided. Syed Khalaf had other valuables mortgaged to the Banians through Syed Nasir, for Rs. 27,000 and also other pearls mortgaged to Ali Bin Nasir for Rs. 1,000. After some time Sheikh Isa Bin Ali Issued orders that the case be decided by an Ijlas composed of the following persons 1. Muqbil AlDukher. 2. Abdul Rahman Bin Idan. 3. Vishan Das, Banian. 4. Syed Ulwi Bin Syed Jawwad. 5.. Haji Hasan Bin Salman. '6. Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab. 7. Ramoh. 8. One representative from the house of Ganga Ram. The order was placed in the hands of Muqbil. The above sat as Judges and decided that one of the Banians should be deputed to take action regard ing all the valuables of the deceased, mortgaged or otherwise, and that all the valuables be collected together, and sold, and all liabilities of the deceased to be paid therefrom. Ramoh, Banian, offered to become responsible, and he col- lected together all the valuables mortgaged to the Banians and all others. These were then put to auction, and I heard that they fetched a price of Rs 1,05,000. All the purchasers except Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab, who purchased the greater portion of the pearls, paid for their purchases there and then, but this man said he had no money just then, and he would pay and take over'his share of the pearls a few days later. His share was therefore placed in the charge of Ramoh for the time being, with the explicit understanding that the pearls could be handed over to Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab only on the occasion of his paying up the value of his purchases. The Judges then paid to the following the sums against their names, in discharge of the liabilities of my husband :— Rs. 1. Banians and Ali Bin Nasir in liquidation of mortgages ... 28,000 2. Syed Sadiq ... ••• ••• ••• I0 » 000 3. Ramoh, in return for the sum he advanced to Sheikh Isa as ' khidma' 10,000 Total ... 48,000 Thus the balance left was ••• ••• ••• 57&gt; 000 Syed Khalaf had also a demand of Rs. 4,000 upon his cousin, Syed Nasir, for whom he paid this sum to the Banians. Syed Nasir had mortgaged certain ornaments to Banians for Rs. 4) ooC, an ^ ^ was on accoun ^ m y husband, the late Syed Khalaf, paid Rs. 4,000 to the Banians and himself got possession of Syed Nasir's ornaments. Later on my husband represented to Syed Nasir that the value of the ornaments mortgaged did not come up to Rs. 4000 (it is only 3,000) so he should offer something else to make up the deficiency. Syed Nasir gave over a house for this purpose. To decide this matter, Muqbil and his colleague judges broached the subject to ^yed Nasir. But Syed Nasir said that against this, he had a demand of greater value on thedeceased. But the judges refused to entertain his case in consequence of h\Q failure to substantiate his statement and the ornaments were forthwith deposited with Muqbil. Mohammad Bin Abdul Wahab, with an order from Sheikh Isa, called upon Ramoh to deliver up to him unconditionally the pearls of Syed Khalaf, that he purchased at auction, and that were deposited with Ramoh at the time. In the same manner Syed Nasir got an order from Sheikh Isa upon Muqbil, that he should deliver up to Syed Nasir the ornaments that were depositeil with him. Both these people took away the valuables without paying money for them. I hear that Sheikh Isa Bin All has appropriated to himself the whole of the proceeds of the pearls purchased by Mohammed Bin Abdul Wahab, while some also say that the money cemains with Mohammed Bin Abdul Wahab to fructify his pockets. Whoever be the person, it is certain that none of these has a right to take a benefit which belongs to others and that is a clear case of illegal misappropriation. I raised my voice of complaint and appeal to God against this cruel.oppres sion. And next I implore the kind assistance of the great and merciful and just British Government for a redress of the wrongs done to me. I am a poof widow and have small children. I have no means of livelihood, and my father himself, on whom I am dependant just now t is in straitened circumstances. I only want justice and claim my rights. My deceased husband, Syed Khalaf, had miscellaneous demands upon dif ferent people, and also he had inherited gardens, and ornaments and other things. All these are now in the hands of outsiders, and we that have the rights, are totally deprived of the benefits. I humbly beg the Government to take this-case also early into considera^ tion, and to so arrange matters that my Agent may be able to present himself at the same time as the defendants, before the court of justice of Sheikh Ahmed Bin Aarz (Shiah Kazi). As you can see, owing to plague, these days are full of danger for me, and I am very much afraid that some men may die who are now in the possession of our rights and so the miscellaneous thing® may altogether disappear beyond redemption. I am very anxious for an early settlement of this part of my claim. My Agent in this case is my father, Salman Bin Rajab. I have another claim with regard to the ornaments taken out of our house. These are different from those mortgaged by Syed Nasir to my husband, and they have not been included in the articles so far mentioned. I shall ever feel grateful and pray, etc., etc.j etc., SHAHA, widow of Syed Khalaf. Thumb Mark. No. , dated Bushire, the 15th July 1905. From — M ajor P. Z.

I have however referred both this case and the general question to the Government of India with whom the affairs of Bahrein are still sub judice, and as it does not appear that the widow s interests will suffer the more for the short delay involved, it will be advisable for you not to move further in the matter until they have had time to communicate their views. 3. Nevertheless if in the meanwhile the work of your office continues to be hampered by the refusal of persons to sit as assessors, I see no reason why you should not inform Sheikh Isa of the fact in a friendly way and in mentioning Syed Khalaf's affairs as the apparent cause suggest that he should go into_ the matter in case some injustice may prove to have been done; but as even this course will somewhat discount any further action that the Government of India may eventually sanction, it will be preferable that you should not resort to it unless it becomes a matter of urgency to do so. m f. • • i • • • • •f^zdmrn Z* No, 354, dated Bushire, the 23rd (received 31st) July 1905. ^ From — M ajor P.

With reference to your telegram of the 18th June 1905, which was forwar ded to me from Maskat by post, informing me that the Government of India concurred in the remarks contained in paragraph 3 of my letter No. 120, dated the nth April 1905, I have the honour to report that I informed Sheikh Esa accord ingly in due course and requested him to communicate the same to Sheikh Ali and to advise him to come in without delay. 2. The Chief replied that Sheikh Ali was unlikely to pay any attention to his advice and asked me to favour him with a letter from myself to the address of his nephew. 3. I enclose an English copy of the letter which I sent to the Chief for trans mission in compliance with this request, and also a translation of the reply which I have received from Sheikh Ali. 4. Sheikh Esa informs me that tnere is little doubt that Sheikh Ali is now ready to come in, and states that he is sending a boat over to Katr to fetch him. As soon as the fugitive arrives here, I shall report the fact to you, and in the meanwhile I venture to hops that the decision of the Government of India will be obtained as to where he should be conveyed by our man-of-war and as regards his subsequent disposal. 5. I recommend that the Government now insist on his residing in India for at least 3 years at his own expense, and after that time he be permitted to o-o anywhere he pleases so long as he keeps away from the Persian Gulf and Maskat, Basrah and Baghdad for another two years. He will then probably elect to go to Mecca and Egypt. Perhaps Rawalpindi would be the most suita ble place for Sheikh Ali to be located in during the first 3 years if our Politi cal Officer with the Afghan refugees could be requested to take him under supervision.

Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 237, dated the 15th July 1905, I have the honor to report that Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed with 4 of his servants who were sen tenced to expulsion from Bahrein returned and surrendered themselves to Sheikh Isa on the 18th instant. 2 I have impressed upon the Chief that he is absolutely responsible for their safe custody until they are taken over by one of our Government vessels, and Sheikh Isa replied that he recognized this fact. Sheikh Ali is staying with his brother Muhammad in Manama. 3. The 4 'hooligans'-' who have returned are Zaeed bin Saad, Zaeed bin Ferhan, Bakhit Nubi and Saad Kahtani. Of these the first two were amongst those who were flogged on the 4th December 1904, and the others were amongst the 6 additional men whose surrender was demanded on the 25th February 1905. The remainder who have not surrendered have left Sheikh Ali and are believed by him to have gone pearling in boats belonging to Katar. Sheikh Ali proposes to take the four, who have comeback, into exile with him, and trusts that when he returns to Bahrein they will be allowed to accompany him. I hope that you will recommend to Government the modification of these men's sentences accordingly, as they all have families in Bahrein, and their master will doubtless keep a stricter control over them in the future. 4. Now that the whole of our original demands are practically complied with before any alternatives have been presented to Sheikh Isa, it seems doubtful whether we should frame any more in connection with the past incidents. At the same time I think that much benefit will accrue from Sheikh Hamad's ob taining a better acquaintance of our power and methods by a year's visit to India, and I still therefore recommend that this course be pressed upon him on the ground of the desirability of his becoming better acquainted with the country that will in the future protect him in his rule over Bahrein.

' foreigners in the island, Major Cox made certain recommendations^: with a view to securing guarantees for the more satisfactory administration of affairs in the future. The measures which he proposed were :— (a) The appointment of a Wazir selected for him by the Government of ■India to carry on the government of Manama under the immediate guidance of the Political Agent. (b) The creation of a small police force under a native police officer of the Government of India. (c) The warning of the present Ruler's heir, Sheikh Hamed, that, in spite of the recognition given by the Government of India to his right to succeed, their ultimate acquiescence in his succession will depend entirely on his satis factory demeanour from this day forward. (d) The exercise by the Political Agent of his influence with Sheikh Esa, in order to prevail upon him to allow his grandson, Khalifa, to be sent to India for a time for education and training in view of the possibility of his eventual selection to succeed in place of Sheikh Hamed. In accordance with instructions^ the Political Agent has delivered the § Secret e ., August 1905, Nos. 523-563. warning suggested under (c). Major Cox's proposal as to (a) has also been sanctioned. 3. As regards the proposed appointment of a Wazir, Major Cox's attention was drawn to some of the difficulties which stood in the way of carrying out the suggestion, and he was reminded that the reform of the Customs adminis tration was still the first question to which the Political Agent should address himself. A further report was also called for, and in reply Major Cox sub mitted certain proposals by Captain Prideaux, which may be summarised as follows:— (a) That it would be better that, until the Political Agent has acquired adequate influence over the Sheikh, no steps whatever should be taken to || Secret A D g u .t 1605, No 8 . 523.563.

A reply, copy of which we have the * appendix a . honour to enclose,* has now been drafted - to Major Cox's letter, laying down what are considered in practice to be the approximate limits of the British Protectorate in Bahrein, so lar as it has yet been developed; the principles are also defined by which Captain ^ Prideaux should be guided in his relations towards the ruler of the island. As, however, the points dealt with in the draft letter involve the consideration of important questions of international law, and moreover bear indirectly on the general subject of the British position in the Persian Gulf, we are postponing its issue until His Majesty's Government have had an opportunity of considering it and of stating whether they approve of its terms. • We have the honour to be.

(Confidential.) {Draft of a proposed letter.) Prom The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA in the Foreign Department, To Major P. Z. COX, C.LE., POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Sir, I am dirocted to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 331 of 16th July and your telegram of 2nd August, on the subject of Bahrein affairs. 2. I am to convey to you the satisfaction of the Government of India at the surrender of Sheikh Ali. It is hoped that this event will remove a disturbing factor from the counsels of Sheikh Esa. 3. As regards the question of our future relations with Bahrein, you submit certain proposals by Captain Prideaux, which may be summarised as follows :— - {a) That it would be better that, until the Political Agent has acquired adequate influence over the Sheikh, no steps whatever should be taken to press on Sheikh Esa the proposals recommended originally in your letter No. 123 (Confidential) of 11th March last and referred to in this Department letter No. 1873 E.-B. of 17th May. {b) That the Political Agent should be authorised to intervene with direct instructions to the Chief in the following matters, namely,— (i) the oppression exercised by the A1 Khalifa family, the Magisterial and Revenue officials, and the Kazis; (ii) the extravagant entertainment of Bedouins; (Hi) reform of land revenue administration; {iv) legal disputes between the Sheikh and his subjects. Captain Prideaux appears to hope that, by consistently adopting this policy, the Political Agent will gradually be furnished with a status in the island independent of the Sheikh; that the Sheikh will thus be cowed into an attitude of general amenability to reasonable suggestions; and that the termination of the present system of exactions will result in so much loss of revenue to the Sheikh that he will, in his own interest, desire the reform of his Customs. 4. You concur in the advisability of adopting Captain Prideaux's first sug gestion ; but before submitting any definite opinion on his other proposals, you invite a pronouncement of the Government of India on the proposition that there is no middle course between the two policies of treating Bahrein (I) as a full British Protectorate; (2) as an independent principality.2 It is clear to the Government of India that such a middle course does exist; but before replying to your enquiry, I am to point out, with reference to your interpretation of a full British Protectorate as involving the right to intervene in the internal administration of Bahrein to the extent contem plated by Captain Prideaux, that there is no authority for the supposition that Great Britain would necessarily possess such a right, even were she formally to notify a British Protectorate over Bahrein to Eoreign Powers. This misconception is due to the assumption which has been made that the alternative to regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent Sovereign is to treat him like a petty Indian Baja. The analogy here introduced, although not without its uses as indicating the methods which, in the light of Indian experience, may successfully be employed in dealing with the Chief, must be regarded as misleading in several important respects. Por, even assuming that the measure of interference advocated by the Political Agent would be legitimate in an Indian Native State (a proposition which needs some reservations in the instance of such Chiefs as enjoy a full measure of internal autonomy), it must be borne in mind that in the case of Native States in India, the British Power is the sovereign, and not merely.the Pro tecting Power, and that, in the same degree as they have lost the majority' of the attributes of sovereignty as well as of independence, reciprocal rights and obligations have been created between them and the Government of India, which as yet have no exact counterpart in the relations of Great Britain to Bahrein. 5. The exact interpretation of a Protectorate is a general question of international law into which the Government of India see no necessity to enter on the present occasion. But, as regards the case of Bahrein, the facts appear to them to be sufficient to establish the following conclusions. They are of opinion that Great Britain is the Protecting Power of Bahrein, and that Bahrein is, therefore, in the present state of affairs, under the Protectorate of Great Britain in the following sense:— (i) The British Government, and they alone, as distinct from Turkey, Persia, or any other Power, control the foreign relation? of Bahrein. The Sheikh has bound himself not to enter into relations with any other Power. The British Government therefore undertake the protection of foreigners in Bahrein. (ii) The reciprocal aspect of this obligation is that Great Britain is bound to protect the islands from any external aggression or assault. (iii) Prom these circumstances it results that British influence and authority are and must be in the ascendant in Bahrein. Primarily this influence is political both in character and origin : and it gives Great Britain the right to claim that, in any matter to which she attaches high importance, her advice must be followed. The acceptance of British advice in such circum stances is the return paid by the State for the advantages which British protec tion confers. British rights in this respect were explicitly stated in the recent ultimatum which was presented by you to the Sheikh on the 24th Eebruary 1905 in compliance with instructions. Further, if British advice must be accepted, it follows that action in contravention of it, whether it takes the form of vacillation, of bad faith, or of open contumacy, cannot be tolerated, the Protecting Power being the judge of the manner in which it will prohibit, reprimand, or punish such action. (iv) The British paramountcy in Bahrein is commercial as well as political in character. This follows partly as a consequence of political predominance, but still more, in the case of Bahrein, from the undisputed commercial predominance of Great Britain in the islands and ports of the Persian Gulf. (v) The political position of Great Britain in Bahrein has given her not merely an interest, but a recognised right of interference in the succession. It was at the instance of the Sheikh himself that she recognised his eldest son. She holds herself at liberty to withdraw that recognition whenever—for good reasops—she may think it desirable, and to nominate another successor in his place. The exercise of this right is of course inconsistent with independ ent sovereignty : and it may be said to involve in a serise direct interference kwith the internal affairs of the State. It is understood that no such right is claimed in the case of any of the Trucial States on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and its frank admission by the Chief of Bahrein is the most explicit evidence yet supplied of the dimensions which the Protectorate has already assumed. (vi) The case of the Customs may be brought within the prerogative of the Protecting Power, under more than one of the above-named heads, according to the point of view from which it is regarded. Originally the appointment of a . British Customs officer was advocated by British Presidents in the Gulf as a mark of British authority. Then it was recommended in the interests of the Sheikh and the equilibrium of his finances. Pinally, it was urged in the interests of Sheikh Hamed, his son, whose future position our recognition of his claims to the succession required us to safeguard. Whichever of these views be adopted, the insistence of Great Britain upon the measure may be regarded as an illustration of the advice which, in virtue of her general controlling authority, she deems it necessary to give, and which the Sheikh is not at liberty permanently to disregard. 6. 'The above are, in the opinion of the Government of India, approximately the limits of our Protectorate, so far as it has as yet been developed. It follows from this that for none of the claims put forward by the Political Agent is there any justification, and that he should not attempt to apply interference or pressure in the various forms which he suggests with a view to forcing the Sheikh to adopt premature reforms, but that he should devote himself to the busi ness of acquiring the confidence of the ruler. Instructions in this sense should be given to Captain Prideaux, with a view to his building up a position which will enable him to tendei* advice for the gradual amelioration of the internal administration. The one point upon which the Government of India are com pelled at the present stage to 'offer authoritative advice is that of Customs reform, which, after the previous declarations made to Sheikh Esa on the subject, is not a matter which can be allowed to rest until the Chief chooses to take action. On this matter they are prepared to await your advice as to the manner in which, and the moment when, a communication should be made to Sheikh * Esa, and it will be for you to consider whether the best course would not be to have a frank explanation with the Chief, and to let him know that his dependence upon the British Government is not consistent with the permanent disregard of the advice so frequently tendered to him in this matter; advice which when thus seriously repeated, must be regarded as possessing the authoritative chrracter referred to in the ultimatum presented to him in February last.

Jn the opinion of His Majesty's Government, the time has not yet arrived for defining in strict terms the position of the Sheikh of Bahrein towards the protecting British Power; and the attributes of suzerainty set forth in the draft letter, both as regards the Native States of India and the State of Bahrein, are described in terms which cannot unreservedly bo accepted as correct. His Majesty's Govern ment, therefore, consider that, in the present circumstances, it will suffice that the Political authorities in the Persian Gulf should 'be instructed to act, as is proposed in the 6th paragraph of the draft letter, by steadily, and, as far as possible, unobtrusively, increasing their nfluenee and the confidence of the Sheikh in their advice and power to direct and control his external affairs. 8. With regard to the question of the management of the Customs, I observe that it is proposed further to consult the Resident in the Gulf as to the steps to be taken.

With reference to previous correspondence relative to the affairs of Bahrein, ending with my letter of the 11th May last, I am directed , by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to enclose, for the information of the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 178 (Secret), dated 14th September, and enclosures, on the subject. 2. Lord Lansdowne will see that, before issuing definite instructions for the future guidance of the Political Agent, the Government of India have submitted the draft of a letter embodying those instructions for the approval of His Majesty's Government. 3. The Secretary of State for India, as at present advised, is doubtful whether the time has yet arrived for defining in strict terms the position of the Chief of Bahrein towards the protecting British Govern ment, and the attributes of suzerainty set forth in the draft letter both in regard to the Native States of India and the State of Bahrein are described in terms which the Secretary of State for India cannot unreservedly accept as correct. In present circumstances, and in view of our recent authoritative interference in Bahrein, it seems to Mr. Brodrick sufficient that the Political authorities should be directed to act, as is proposed by the Government of India in paragraph 6 of their draft letter, by steadily, and, as far as possible, unobtrusively, increasing their influence and the confidence of the Sheikh in their advice and power to direct and control his external affairs. As regards the management of the Customs, it is observed that the Government of India will further consult the llesident in the Gulf, and, on the receipt of his reply, their specific recommendations can receive full consideration. 4.

About six years ago I vras in perfect a quietness,pleased vrith your RepresentativeA usages,disposing myself of the things of the Principality rrithput any interference,and all the natives were pleased v.dth me and my treating them. Merely between your State (whose power 'od save I) and me there was two agreements dated 19th Iluharram 1298 (cor responding to the 22nd December 1880)and 14th Bhaban 1309 (corresponding to the 13th I.Iarch 1892) ,by vrhich I had bound myself not to inter into negociations nor make treated of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said British Government^ and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British,to establish diplomatic or consula'r agencies or coaling depots in my territory,unless with the consent of the British Government. a But,as to the home matters,I was ruler as the Bahrein rulers my predecessors without difference,except that the British Government had here a Representative under whose jurisdiction your subjects was lain. But that agent was a~ Mussulman,knowing the exigences# of the religion of the Principality people and all the I.Iussulmans,between whom and him the relations were extremely easy. But,these six years ago,my tranquillity changed in trouble,and I became grieved with the vexations of your Representatives,and their lowering my situation without motive from me. 1. At first,your Representatives obliged me to inter dict the sale of arms,and I became deprived of this advan tage,! only,among the Arabs* Chiefs/ for it is a free trade elsewhere on all the Arabian coast. 2. Later the Mussulman representative here was replaced for an Lnglish one,who meddled, himself with the home matte and arrogated to himself the competency in what was no business of his,though he was ignorant of the religious TS i ; • i i . ■! j : 4 . i * e i mm V 11 \ • - I - * £ ^ * . L' r - « • b A &gt; s •. A. lav; and customs of 'the Hussulmans. Here is an example of vrhat resulted of that. , ' A German merchant evinced contempt for one of my family's princes,the Shaikh Ali,a son of my late brother Ahmad,and in some rray one of my sons,married rrith my daughter. Then three men of imr went in front of the Principality capital,for the sake of that German merchant,and staid there many days, threatening and preparing for battle rrith us. 3. Afterwards your Representatives asked me for delivering my son,the Shaikh Hamad,to them,and I,for my respect to Britain^ a delivered him to them; then they arrested him and kept him prisoner on board of one of the vessels. «» .....va 4. They seized upon the house of mine at which I had autho^ rized the Shaikh Ali to live ih, they possessed themselves of all his personal properties,horses,thoroughbred camels,house hold goods,utensils etc.; they carried all .that to Bushir©, Kuweit and l.Iuscat, except a part which burned. 5. As Shaikh Ali had fled for fear,your Representatives requested me to proclaim order to arrest him,and I did so,not wi11ingly but by forc e. 6. On account of the quarrel which had happened between the G-erman and the Ali's servants,your Representatives ordered and gathered a fine,and I must have got scourged violently the Shaikh Ali * s servants in presence of the Political Resident ofTjfe Peysian^and the Political Assistant at Bahrein. Accordingly that affair was a. settled one,when,at my amazement,happened the event aforesaid. 7. 'When Shaikh Ali surrendered,asking for indulgence from the gracious Imperial Government,he was arrested and he is yet a prisoner. 8. They threw down my flag mast,the signe of my rank. 9. After all that I wrote to your Representatives that they state to the gracious Government the vexations I had suffe/^ y ' but no reply reached me from them. Accordingly I try to move your pitj,and I request from you- justice and equity that-you r'estore me in my previous quietness and contentment, for it is the state that suit you as we 11 as u$ / and thereby your reputation will be retrieved among the people • - =:of these countries. * I wrote this in tvio copies,one of which I send to ih Vice-Poy of India, E. 11.

Cox, C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Bahrein, which has reached me just as I am leaving on tour. 2. The Government of India will remember that Rs. 300 was the amount which I first mentioned as sufficient as far as I could judge for Sheikh Ali's maintenance. The Government of Bombay however asked for double that sum, and it is indeed a good deal less than Sheikh Ali was drawing in Bahrein. 3. 1 doubt if the Government of India will consider it expedient to modify the figure at present agreed without further Information ; but I think Sheikh Ali - will be found hardly to require so much as Rs. 600 and I suggest that we should tell Sheikh Esa that he must pay that sum for the present but as time goes on we will see if any reduction is possible. From —captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 1390, dated the 23rd September 1905, I have the honor to report that I communicated to Sheikh Esa bin Ali at a personal interview the» Government of India's orders on the subject of the allowance required for Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and the arrangement made with respect to the four rowdies who have been sent to Hyderabad. 2. The Chief protested very strongly against the amount asked for from him, declaring that Sheikh Ali's whole income barely reached Rs. 600 per men sem, and since the latter's flight to Katar, he himself had been maintaining his nephew's families at an expenditure of Rs. 400 per mensem. He remarked that -if he contributed Rs. 300 monthly for Sheikh Ali's personal support he would be paying Rs. 100 out of his own pocket, but that he would not object to doing as much as this. ^ Finally he requested me to repeat in writing what I had said to him, in order that he might prepare a reply which could be forwarded to Government for consideration, and a translation of the letter I subsequently received from the Chief is attached to this report. 3. To obtain another Independent estimate of Sheikh All's income I have just asked the latter's brother Mahomed confidentially to inform me what he believes it to be, and Sheikh Mahomed in reply has put it at a fixed revenue from gardens and Customs Department of Rs. 8,000 per annum, plus the rent of his godowns and shops—probably Rs. 1,200 per annum, plus an addi tional Rs. 2,400 or Rs. 3,000 received irregularly from the Chief, apart from the other allowances in kind mentioned in the 9th paragraph of my letter No. 135, dated the 27th April 1905' This estimate does not differ very much from the one I first made. 4. In these circumstances I do not believe that the Chief will suffer any personal pecuniary loss if the remittance of Rs. 600 demanded of him monthly is insisted upon, but I am sure that he will never be able to see the reasonable ness of the demand, and I therefore hope that if possible the question may be further considered. Sheikh Esa himself informs me that he sees no reason why Sheikh Ali should be sent to reside in so expensive a place as Bombay with its many noval temptations for extravagance, and that if double the amount of • Rs. 600 were allotted to him there, he would still probably ask for more. 5. I think that it would be a mistake now to allow Sheikh Ali to live outside of India with a view to the lessening of his expenditure, but if he could be ordered to so&gt;-ne less expensive place than Bombay, such as Karachi or a quieter place in the interior of India, the change would give much satisfaction to the Chief and his shaken belief in our kind sentiments towards himself and his family would be appreciably restored.

Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein^ dated 6th Shd'ban ij2j {5th October /poj). I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated the 3rd Sha'ban 1323 and (to say) that I duly understand that you have, by the last mail, received a letter from the Resident, Persian Gulf, to the effect that the monthly allowance that the Government of Bombay have reported to be suitable for the proper maintenance of Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed and his servants will be Rs. 600 and that you desire that I should send this sum to you on the first day of every English month; that you will forward this to Bushire, and thence (it will go) to the Bombay Treasury at regular period. It is not hidden from you that the said Sheikh Ali has wives and children and servants, both male and female, and that I have been paying, for their main tenance and clothes, a very considerable amount, and that the income from the sources that I have allotted to him, do not come up to this expenditure, and~ yet to pay Rs. 600 every month for Sheikh Ali I I beg to say to you that my uncle, Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa, was of a higher rank and more renowned (a person) than Sheikh Ali, and when he (the former) was in exile under the charge of the British Government, a monthly allowance was fixed for him of less than this sum. I therefore request you to represent these circumstances to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. With my faith in the equity and justice of the British Government I believe that they will not be willing to see me taxed for what is not obligatory on me, and that they will pass orders for a less amount.No. 6 of 1906.

ANNEX. Petition from the 'Sheikh of Bahrein. (Translated from the Arabic). I lay open my complaint hereby to the gracious British Governments compassion. About six years ago I was in perfect quietness, pleased with your representatives' usages, disposing^my- _ _ beii of the things of the principality without any inter ference\ interference, and all the natives tvere pleased 'with me and my treating them. Merely between your State (whose power G-od save!) and me there was two agreements, dated 19th Muharram 1298 (corresponding to the 22nd December 1830) and 14th Shaban 1309 (corresponding to the 13th March 1892), by which I had bound myself not to enter into negociations nor make treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the said Britihh Government, and to refuse permission to' any other Govern ment than the British to establish diplomatic or Consular Agencies or coaling depots in my territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. But, as to the home matters, I was a ruler as the Bahrein rulers my predecessors without difference, except that the British Government had here a representative under whose jurisdiction your subjects was lain. But that Agent was a Mussulman, knowing the exigences of the reli gion of the principality people and all the Mussulmans, whom and him the relations were extremely easy. But,these six years ago, my tranquility changed in trouble, and I became grieved with the vexations of yoitr representatives, and their lowering my situation without motive from me. m 1. At first, your representatives obliged me to inter dict the sale of arms, and I became deprived of this ad vantage, I only, among the Arabs' Chiefs; for it is a free trade elsewhere on all the Arabian Coast. 2. Later the Mussulman representative here was replaced for an English one, who meddled himself with the home matters, and arrogated to himself the competency in what was no business of his, though he was ignorant of the re- - ligious law and customs of the Mussulmans. Here is an ex ample of what resulted of that. A German merchant evinced contempt for one of my family's princes, ohe Sheikh Ali, a son of my late-brother . • i •* . H * 4p MR r&gt; El Ahmad, and in some way one of my sons, married with my daughter. Then three men of war went m front of the Prin cipality capital, for the sa,ke of that German merchant, and stayed there many days, threatening and preparing for battle with us. 3. Afterwards your representatives asked me for deliver ing my son, the Sheikh Hamad, to them, and I, for my res pect to Britain, delivered him to them; then they arrested him and kept him prisoner on board one of the vessels. 4. They seized upon the house of mine at which I had au thorised the Sheikh Ali to live in;they possessed them selves of.all his personal properties, horses, thorough bred camels, household goods, utensils, etc. . they carried all that to Bushire, Koweit and Musca.t, except a part which burned. 5. As Sheikh Ali had fled for fear,, your. representatives requested me to proclaim order to arrest him, and I did so, not willingly but by force. 6. On account of the quarrel which had happened between the German and the Ali's servants, your representatives order ed and gathered a fine, and I must have got scourged vio- letktly the Sheikh Ali's servants in presence of the Poli tical Resident of the Persian Gulf, and the Political Assistant at Bahrein. Accordingly, that affair was a set- tied one, when, at my amazement, happened the event afore said. 7. When Sheikh Ali surrendered, asking for indulgence from the gracious Imperial (Government, he was arrested and is yet a prisoner. 8. They threw down my flag mast, the sign of my rank. 9. After all that I wrote to your representatives that 'ohey state to the gracious Government the vexations I had suffered; but no reply reached me from them. Accordingly, I try to move your pity, and I request from your justice and equity that you restore me in my HI h III! Hi ^ previous quietness and contentment; for it is the state - that r . • ■ ---'i kZ - - ■ -that suit you as well as us, and thereby your reputation will be retrieved among the people of these countries. I wrote this in two copies, one of which I send to the Viceroy of India, His Excellency Lord Minto, and the . other to the Secretary of State for India, His Excellency Mr: Brodrick.

Major, Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf.No. 2111-E,B. From R. E. HOLLAND. Esq., I.C.S., Assistant Secretary to the Oovemment of India, Foreign Department^ To /s ' M ajor P. Z. COX, C.I.E., Political Besident in the Ferstan Gulf, JBushire, Simla, the 22nd May 1906, S ir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 73, dated the 25th February 1906, on the subject of Sheikh Esa's memorial. 2. I am to request that you will now forward to the Sheikh a reply couched in the following terms The necessary references to communications made by yourself or your predecessors or by the Assistant Political Agent to the Sheikh should be inserted in the letter. ' The Government of India have received the memorial, dated October 2nd of ' 1905, which you addressed to the Viceroy and Governor-General, and have ' given it their careful consideration. You complain firstly that representatives ' of the British Government obliged you to interdict the sale of arms and that ' you were thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all the Arab Chiefs along ' the Arabian Coast. I am to remind you in the first place that in 1S95, when you ** were in danger of an attack by Sheikh Qasim bin Thani, you yourself restricted ' the importation of arms by granting a concession to your Vizier to import arms ' and ammunition subject to the express condition that arms were not to be sold , Reports appended to Lieutenant-Colonel Meade's ^ Bahrein Or On the neighboUling Arab letters No. 34., dated 16th May 1898, and No. (&gt;9, ** Coast. Your obiect in impOSinST this dated 21«t November 1898. ' j .' * i..i r restriction was to curtail as far as pos- ' sible the importation of arms which might be used against you, and your ' family. Shortly afterwards when you heard that the holders of the concession ' were evading the condition which prohibited sales to the inhabitants of Bahrein •'or on the Arab Coast, you ordered your Vizier to stop the importation altoge- ther. In pursuance of this policy you attached a large quantity of imported ' arms in January 1898 on your own initiative and without being prompted or ' advised to do so in any way by representatives of the British Government. ** In February 1898, the Resident at Bushire informed you of the desire of Lieutenant-Colonel Meade 's letter No. 7, dated 41 the Government of India to prohibit 23rd February 1898. a traffic in arms and you at once, and ' without any hesitation or protest, issued a notification announcing that you N- ' had resolved to assist the British and Persian Government in suppressing the ' trade in arms and ammunition between Bahrein, India and Persia. In April ' 1898, at the request of the Resident you issued, again without protest or ' objection of any kind, a revised notification prohibiting absolutely the impor- Lieutenant-Coionei Meade's letter No. 39, dated ' tation of arms and ammunition into, and soth May i898. exportation of the same from the ' Island of Bahrein, In this notification you referred to a previous notification' which tou had spontaneonsly issued in January 1896, forbidding the sale of ''arms and ammunition to your subjects. In view of these facts, the Goyem- ' ment of India are unable to understand on what grounds you now represent 14 that you were forced by British representatives to interdict the sale of arms. ' Further you are w T ell aware that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of ' the Crucial Coast have similarly prohibited the traffic in arms in their terri- ' tories, and your statement that you are deprived of an advantage enjoyed by ** all the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian Coast is therefore ineorrect. Finally ' I am to remind you that the people of Bahrein in general have no need for 'more arms than they possess, and that it is always open to you to procure the *' consent of the Government of India to import whatever arms you may 'yourself need for special reasons. It is to your own interest' that the ' importation of arms should be restricted, but apart from this the Government ' of India would not consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or •'modifying the agreement into which you have entered, since it is essential *• for the preservation of the public peaee that the traffic in arms along the •'Arabian Coast should be rigidly confined and limited. 'In the second place you complain that an English representative has 'been substituted for the former Mussalnrm representative of the British Gov- V ernment in your State and that, as a consequence of his interference in the ' internal admifiistration of the state, you were forced to arrest your relative 'Sheikh Ali and surrender him to the British authorities for an imaginary ' offence. In reply to this, I am to remind you that the political and commercial ' conditions in Bahrein have considerably altered of recent years and that in ' consequence it has become necessary for the'Government of India to have a ' more efficient representative, on whose advice you can more confidently rely. ' It is also well known to you th^t the great increase of trade enjoyed by the ' merchants of Bahrein is largely due to the presence of a British officer in ' your island. ' With regard to the case of Sheikh Ali, your nephew, you know that ' he was punished, because he rebelled against your orders and set at naught the •' commands of the British Government. I have already addressed you on this ' subject in my letter dated June 7th, 1905, and it is not necessary for me to say 'anything more with regard to the matter here. 'Next you represent that your flag mast was thrown down by the Enclosure to letter from the Political Rtsident, No. 'British authorities. Ihe Government 259, dated iitb June 1905. « 0 f i nc [i a cannot believe that you are •• actuated by serious motives in preferring this complaint after the Political Agent has given you a personal assurance, which you have accepted, to the «* effect that the flagstaff was not lowered, but was blown down in a heavy gale, ' Finally, the Government of India are unable to understand your allega- ' tion that you receive no reply to the representations which you prefer. 44 1, who am the representative of the Government of India in the Persian Gulf, ' have written to you m reply to your complaints explaining the policy of the ' Government of India and advising you for your good, while your Political •' Agent, Captain Prideaux, has constantly listened to your grievances and assisted ' you with his counsels. In this connection I am to remind you that it is the M duty of British representatives to communicate fully to Government the cir- ' oumstances and wishes of Chiefs to whom they are accredited, and that in view ' of this fact the Government of India can only consider your communications ' when received through the responsible officers w T ith whom you are in touch. ' It was therefore both unnecessary and incorrect for you to forward a copy of ' your petition to the Secretary of State for India through the medium of a ' commercial firm.' 4 I have the honour to be.

With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of Sheikh Ali 's Political Agent, Bahrein, to Political R„ld.nt e f le ' l 1 h:1Ve th . e h ,° n0Ur 'O forward a Copy in the Persian Gulf, No. 399, dated the 7th Septem- Ol the marginally noted report from ber I906 * Captain F. B. Prideaux, from which it will be seen that after all his protestations, including that in his Memorial to Govern ment, Sheikh Esa himself is now the obstacle of Sheikh Ali's return. It is difficult to keep one's patience with such a disingenuous old man. I was well aware that there was in reality no love lost between uncle and nephew but was hardly prepared for this volte face on the part of the former. If the Government of India have not already done so they will, I am sure, now realise what a thoroughly unsatisfactory character he is. 2. Had we control of the Customs and Sheikh Ali were made to sell his property in Manamaa and received a monthly allowance paid by the Political Agent, we might have let him return notwithstanding Sheikh Esa's inner feelings, but in the absence either of a guarantee from his relations or any hold over the purse strings which would supply him with money, I hardly feel it possible to recommend his return. 3. I can only suggest that the Government of India should inform him, or that I should be authorised to inform him, that Sheikh Esa is not able to offer any satisfactory scheme for his return, and that he must therefore make up his mind to remain where he is; but that if he prefers to live elsewhere in India than at Bombay there will be no objection. No. 399, dated Bahrein, the 7th September 1906. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, I .A., Political Agent, To— major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your letter of the 15th August 1906, I have had another conversation with Sheikh Esa about his nephew Sheikh Ali, and I informed him of course that you thought that our proposals connected with Ali's return to Bahrein would be accepted by Government when put definitely into shape. The Chief replied that he had been thinking more about the question, and had come to the conclusion that he did not want Ali back. He knew that Ali was absolutely disloyal and hostile towards himself; he had been in the habit of committing all sorts of irregularities in Manamaa, such as appropriating unauthorizedly to himself some of the Customs receipts and exercising arbitrarily the functions of a magistrate while at the same time levying the Court-fees (' khidma') for his own use; moreover it did not appear likely that the notables of Bahrein would consent to guarantee his future good behaviour. If therefore the Government of India were anxious to return Ali to Bahrein, he requested that they would negociate with him direct, for the Chief felt that if he himself wrote to Ali, the latter would misunderstand and misinterpret his action, and would jump to the conclusion that the Chief had some hidden ulterior motive such as the confiscation of his property, which he might be unable to effect in any other way, I then enquired whether in these circumstances the Chief was willing to pay Ali's Rs. 600 per mensem regularly saying that I knew that you were not prepared to recommend a reduction of the allowance. He said, yes, he would much prefer to pay the allowance, and he hoped that when Ali's 5 years were completed, the Government would then themselves give Ali a stern warning or,i. V i &gt; \ * better, take some personal guarantee from him to ensure his complete sub mission to his uncle. He added that Ali had been petitioning the Governrrent recently under the direction of the Bushire Malik-ut-Tujjar, who was a notorious mad man, and he hoped that Government would not take any notice ot his words. I then asked the Chief whether he thought that there was any objection to withdrawing Ali from Police surveillance in Bombay and allowing him to go and live w T here he liked in India, provided that he drew his allowance personally from a treasury. The Chief replied that he thought there was no danger whatever of Ali's trying to return to Bahrein without permission, and therefore he saw no objection to this action being taken. From an independent source I have recently heard that Sheikh Hamad has come round to the opinion of his father and has been openly expressing it to the effect that Ali was a mischievous character and that his room was better than ' his company. In these circumstances, I hope you will be able to recommend to Government that he should work out the full period of his banishment in India, but at the same time that he should be allowed to live where and how he likes. I am personally strongly of opinion that his coming back to Bahrein will now cause the ignorant public to believe that we recognise that we have been too harsh, and at the same time I feel very strongly that if we do not accom modate Sheikh Esa in these small matters, it is very up-hill work to get him back to a contented frame of mind. ym : 'C' r G.

From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—H. R.C. Dobbs, Esq., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. The Foreign Department will perhaps be receiving more petitions from Sheikh Ali or expecting to hear something from me respecting him, so I write to report progress. I had a long talk with him while passing through Bombay on my return from Simla. He was outwardly very submissive in his tone but very pressing in his .prayers to be allowed to return to Bahrein. Asked if he preferred to receive a monthly allowance through an Agent and to be allowed to go anywhere else he pleased, the Persian Gulf excepted, he replied in the negative saying that if he had to be anywhere away from Bahrein and his family, Bombay, would suit him as well as any place would. Asked if, supposing he were allowed to return to Bahrein before the expiry of his term of exile, he would be prepared to do so under certain very clear written conditions, he replied, ' What was the use of his subscribing to conditions when Government were in a position to impose any terms that they pleased upon him. ' I enquired into his allowances and am clearly of opinion that they are un' riecessarily large, but under the circumstances I fear any curtailment of them now would only give him a fresh cause for worrying the Bombay authorities and the Government of India with his importunities, and I do not feel justified in recommending it, in view of the possibility of his soon being allowed to return. Sheikh Ali frankly admitted that there was no love lost between him and his uncle and that in view of their past ancestral relations, feelings of sincere good will could never exist between them, but that he was ready to be guided by our wishes in all things. The man is an unpleasant and troublesome character, and I only take his protestations for what they are worth, but he has probably been taught a suffi cient lesson, and before leaving Bombay I came to the conclusion that instead of cutting down his allowances, it might be more convenient, if his wings could be first sufficiently clipped, to allow him to return to Bahrein. I talked the matter over with the Political Agent on our return journey and in the result asked him to discuss the question with the Sheikh on his return, and see if any satisfactory scheme could be outlined allowing for Sheikh Ali's return, on a basis, of (i) the previous sale of all his property, in Manama ; (ii) a stipulation that he should never be allowed to live in Manama but somewhere in the interior of the island or on the other island of Muharrag ; and finally (ill) a guarantee by the Sheikh for his good behaviour. The accompanying letters will show you what has since transpired. As soon as I can lay any definite proposal before Government I will do so officially, and merely send this to let you know what is going on. Captain Prideaux addressed me demi-officially, but as far as I am concerned there is no reason why these papers should not come on the record. ******* No. 326, dated the 28th July 1906. From— Captain F. B. Prideaux, I. A., Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. When I saw the Chief yesterday he suddenly made a reference to Sheikh Ali's petitions to Government, and asked whether any answer had yet been given to them.I told him that I did not think that Government would pay much considera tion to All's petitions, but that if some satisfactory arrangement could be come to with the Chief on the subject, it was possible that you would consent to advise Government to allow the detenu to return to Bahrein. I then explained to him your views. At this time we were sitting quite alone, only Mr. Hak being with me, and the Chief replied after drawing his chair closer to us, that he had no objection to Ali's coming back if the notables of Bahrein would give a written guarantee for his future good behaviour ! He denied however that Ali had any landed property of his own, saying that all the ' Amaras ' even which he had recently built were subject to the rules of the family and were ' Maniha,' by which he means ' returnable to the State ' and not ' Milkiyat ' the reason, untenable I am inclined to think, being that they had been built out of money supplied to Ali by his uncle at different times. Sheikh Hamad then came in and 1 the Chief at once considerably altered his tone. He said however at first that he did not see any need for himself to ejive us an agreement but I told him that without that Government certainly would not allow Ali to come back. He then said, very well, he would write to Ali and tell him to arrange for the guarantee to be given himself endorsed by the notables, and that then he would himself endorse the promise which Ali would give us. He stipulated that Ali should be allowed to live either in Rifaa or Muharrag, and with regard to the question of his landed ' Milkiyat ' he agreed after some discussion that Ali should appoint a Yakil who should lay before me all proofs that he could in this connection and that my decision on the subject should be binding on himself as well as Ali. If Ali's claims to &lt;f Milkiyat ' in Manamaa were to any extent es tablished he would himself pay AH the value in cash, and the properties would then be amalgamated in those of the State. I had of course insisted that it was absolutely necessary that the question of Ali's properties should be definitely settled before his return, as otherwise the friction would be unending, and the Chief quite saw the force of thist but he first proposed that the Kazi should decide between them. Mr. Hak informed me that Sheikh Jasim was now so hostile to Ali's brother Muhammad that people believe that he was also against Ali too now. So then I asked why Hamad could not decide the point. The Chief did not like this proposal but said in rather an apologetic tone that his love for Hamad was so mu^h greater than for Ali that he was really acting only in the former's interests throughout the matter. He then at once assented to my proposal that I should be allowed to adjudicate myself. I do not know how far you will think this arrangement suitable, but if we get a duplicate copy of the notables' guarantee and also an undertaking signed by Ali and the Chief, Ali being forbidden to reside in Manamaa or to administer or buy any properties in this town, I think the essentials of your requirements are obtained, and if we can also in the course of my inquiry settle the amount definitely ot Ali's future income, there seems to be a fair prospect of peace in the future at last. Dated the 15th August 1906, From— major P. Z. Cox, C .I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain F. B. Prideaux, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein. I sent you by last steamer a hurried acknowledgment of your letter No- 326, dated 29th July, but you will need something more substantial. I feel sure that the Government of India would wish us to settle provision ally the preliminary details of any arrangement providing for Sheikh Ali's return to Bahrein, and that you may safely proceed on the lines upon which you have started. Sheikh Esa s reply, that he had no objection to Sheikh Ali's return provided that the notables of Bahrein would give a written guarantee for his good be haviour is interesting. Of course Sheikh Esa should give it himself properly3 speaking, but his hesitation to do so and his stipulation above mentioned are an obvious confession of weakness on his part which it will be useful to have on record. It would necessarily be countersigned by him eventually. ! fear the chief difficulty will be with the exile himself who will no doubt endeavour to avoid parting with his property in Manamaa, but we must be firm on that important point, and I should think that Government would support us. For the rest, I think the position which you summarise in the last paragraph of your letter would meet all requirements, and I shall look forward to hearing from you that negotiations on these lines are progressing satisfactorily. ■ G.

In the circumstances reported by you the Government of India consider it inexpedient to permit Sheikh Ali to return to Bahrein at present. They have decided, therefore, in accordance with your suggestion, to inform him that Sheikh Esa is not able to offer any satisfactory scheme for his return to Bahrein and that he must make up his mind to remain in India.

In view of the Government of Bombay's opinion in the matter, the Government of India consider that it would be inadvisable to reduce the Sheikh^ allowance, and as Captain Prideaux has reported that Sheikh Esa is now willing to continue payment of the whole sum, there is no need to consider the question further at pre sent. 4. In his letter No: ?26 dated the 28th July 1^06, * Captain Prideaux stated that Sheikh Esa had assented to his proposal that he should-be allowed to aajucate on the ownership of the landed estates enjoyed by Sheikh Ali prior to his deportation from Bahrein. I am to say that, ' as Sheikh Ali is not to return to Bahrein at present, -there is no immediate need for settling the respective claims of the parties to the estates, but that 'Dhere is no it objection to Captain Prideaux acting as adjucator, if Sheikh a Esa still desires him to do so. 5.

V'ith reference to Sheikh Ali's petitions to the Governor-General in Council, forwarded with your letters Hos. 6952 arid 1998, dated TOth October 1905 and l^th ilarch 1906 respectively, I am to request that, with the per mission of His Excellency the Governor in Council, the petitioner may be informed that the Government of India have read with satisfaction the good report sent by the Government of Bombay regarding his behaviour during his stay in Bombay, but that they are unable to accede to his request for the remission of a portion of his punishment, since their decision was arrived at after full considera tion, and moreover Sheikh Esa is at present unable to offeroffer any satisfactory scheme which would insure the goo&lt; behaviour of Sheikh Ali in the event of his returning to Bahrein. It may further be intimated to him that the cir cumstances in which it was found necessary to remove him from Bahrein and to estreat his house and effects were explained to him fully before he left the Island and the (Government of India do not consider it necessary further to explain the action taken by them in the matter, r. In your lex/ter No. 4168, dated the 8th June 1906, the i Government of Bombay enquire whether the Government of India would be prepared to hold proceedings and issue warrants under Regulation III of 1818, for use if necessary against the Sheikh and his followers. In reply, I am to say that as there appears to be little likelihood that the Sheikh will endeavour to return to Bahrein without per mission, the Government of India do not consider it neces sary to issue warrants at present. The question may, how ever, be further considered if the police reports show that Sheikh Ali continues to be restless regarding his detention in Bombay. I have etc., (sd).

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department letter No. 1554-E.B., dated the 18th April 1906, regarding the allowance paid to Sbeikh Ali of Bahrein, I am directed to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following statement supplied by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, of the monthly expenses incurred by Sheikh Ali of Bahrein:— Rs.

I am to state that the Commissioner of Police reports that, with the exception of the item 'cost of food and miscellaneous expenses all the other items have been tested by an examination of the accounts kept by the Sheikh's Interpreter. The Commissioner adds that he is of opinion that Sheikh Ali does not appear to be living extravagantly ; and that, if he has, as he claims, a certain position to keep up, his present allowance cannot be reduced. His Excellency the Governor in Council has no material on which to judge whether the detenu should he allowed a carriage and a corresponding style of life. If he should, then His Excellency agrees with the Commissioner that the expendi ture is not extravagant. 3. I am at the same time to state, with reference to Foreign Department letter No. 1556-E.B., dated the 18th April 1906, that the Sheikh's behaviour •Aocompaniment to letter, dated the 20th April been satisfactory during his stay in 1906, addressod to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, and 1 am to attach a petition* to Bombay, copy enclosed. the address of His Excellency the Gover nor General in Council. Dated Bombay, the 20th April 1906. From— S heikh A li bin A hmad, To—The Commissioner of Police, Bombay. I have the honour to inform you that I am an Arab, inhabitant of Bahrein, and that I was brought to Bombay about six months ago under the orders of the Bombay Government. When I was brought to Bombay it was arranged that I should be paid rupees six hundred every month for my expenses. 1 was accordingly paid Ks. 600 for the first four months after my arrival in Bombay. For the fifth month I was paid Rs. 580 and for the last month I was paid Rs. 550 only. On inquiry I came to learn that the deduc tion was made for payment to my servants who were taken from Bahrein to Karachi. I say that the sum of Rs. 600 is not sufficient for all my expenses and it is very hard that any deduction should be made from that sum. 4Under the circumstances I shall feel obliged if you mil be good enough to make representations in the matter to the proper authorities. I hear that my servants at Karachi have been sent back to Bahrein. I say that ever since my arrival in Bombay I have been obedient to the orders of the authorities and I hope that the exile imposed upon me in this foreign laud will now cease. I say that I have been snatched away from my family and that it is not possible for me any longer to continue here far away from my wife and children. I say that I have made several representations to the Government on the subiect but to no effect. I have therefore to request you to bring this matter to the notice of the Government, and I shall feel highly obliged to you tor the same. I also beg to send you for your information a copy of a petition made by me some time ago to His Excellency the Viceroy.

I think Sheikh Esa's 'best plan will be to answer his nephew in terms which will close the door as far as poss ible to further correspondence between them on the subject He might say that he is glad to hear of Sheikh Ali's welfare, but feels that no useful object will be ac-hieved by a discussion between them of the length of his nephew's absence from Bahrein; a question which rests with the '-overnment of India, A reply in this form seems to me on the whole prefer able to the one which you suggest.

S'hiraz, 3: October Tour vemi-official of 24th August re Shaikh All bin Ahmed and Shaikh Mubarak has reached rae. The 'Sahib' referred to, is me, and not Knox.; but Mubarak has somewhat embroidered the purport of what was said to him. I spoke to him on the subject ivith a purpose,but explained that it was In strict confidence,which he has evidently ab used. He had approached me both in writing and conversation regarding the release of Shaikh Ali, at a time when our relations with 'hinf were (as they still are) very delicate and when it was of the utaiost importance that he should not misunder stand items of our policy in the treatment of the c Shaikhs and should not take alarm at action ta-ven in regard to them, and from it point a mo- ^ ral for himself, 'j-'he measures taken at Bahrein in 1905 did as you know F! «• 4 • • ifrom Knox's report give rise to a great deal of inconvenient comment at Xoweit at the time and Shaikh Mubarak was inclined to suggest that we had been somewhat hard on Shaikh Ali and that the Government of India might magnanimously let him come back. It seemed necessary therefore to explain to him that it was'not only the Gov ernment of India but the interests of Shaikh Ijsa which were concerned and that though it might be possible for us to recommend Covern- ment to let him return under suitable guaran- tees, those guarantees were not at present forthcoming. I particularly told him that I was treat ing him with confidence which I relied on him to respect and I thought that as he was the friend rather of Shaikh Lsa than of Shaikh Ali he would do so. Of course he has abused that confidence in telling Shaikh Ali what I said, and in an exaggerated form and I am sorry toI (® r l\\ r to think that his doing so should possibly increase the enmity between uncle and nephew. On the other hand there is no doubt about Shaikh Jusa 's feelings and I really do not see that we are called upon to encourage the latter to play the hypocrite while we take 9.11 the odium for the e^ile of his nephew.

I also mentioned that although the Government pardoned Ali 'bin Ahmed for his (oheikh Isa's) sake, he gave him more gardens in spite of Political Agent's putting in writing that he should not get any more gardens , as the more he gets the more people 'become under him and he increases his tyranny over them. sheikh Isa said that it was to his (Ali bin Ahmed's) son he gave the gardens, oheikh Isa told me to see Ali 'bin Ahmed with a view to give him warning and advice. Jheikh Isa also told Jheikh Mejibel loin ADduraftman Dekhair to the same effect. jo we hoth went to Ali 'bin Ahmed at Rafa and after telling him a'bout his cruelty to that man and giving him the necessary advice, he said he would not do such things in future and agreed with us that if he has any grieiiances against anybody he should put same 'before sheikh Isa.

At Bosaiba he is insisting people that they should supply him with 2 Itobas of Milk daily for his camels which he says are ill.

I think the uest course would be for you to hand the amount over to Sheilth Hsa with a reouest that he will be so good as to see oo the settlement of the claims of the British sub- jects and protigds against sheilth All. This will be pre- i enable t,o your having to supervise the distribution of the money yourself among the British creditors, which vnll seem to detract from the gracefulness of the rendi- tion.

After Complimenta, years ago Sir Percy - Cox reported to the Government of India that your Excellency in conaultation with him had arranged that Shaikh Ali bin Ahmad should receive from you date gardens worth Rs.82Q0/- per annum and Rs.^OO/- per mensem - the latter to be paid through the Agency. The Government of India forxsave Shaikh Ali entirely out of consideration for you, and on the following conditions, Firstly that he should not reside in Manama or make any claim to any property ~ in that town, or in the future attempt to obtain any property there. Secondly that he should spend his time on the estates granted to him by Vbur Excellency and behave himself suitably. I understand that the punishment meted out to Shaikh Ali by the Hovornment of India hai the desired effect and that for some years he obeyed your commands and behaved properly. Lately, I rsgret to learn he has been exercising tyranny and has been giving great trouble to the poor. This in itself is bad, but what makes worse is that he shows his ingratltude^to you who pleaded for him and the'High * - fOovernmont that for^avo him. I truntl that you will call him baforo you and: deal suitably with him so that I may report a^ain that he behaves himself beoominply to all people and with proper obedience to you.
