Imve in the x»st obtain ed undertakinge from the various Rulers of the /r^b Sheikhdoms of the Persian C’ulf (vis* the Sheikhs of Xdwoit, Bahrein, Qaiar and the . ruoial States) that they would prohibit the traffic of arms in. heir states and they have issued regulations accordingly prohibiting the import of arms and an unit ion of all kinds* As regaxvls military arms and anriunition, esur view, ^ich I gather you accept, is tho.t the pre-'.?ar restrictions should be rc-i posed forthwith* Tith regard, to the particular case of shotguns and shotgun ansnuniticn, we feel that these too ought to be covered by the res rictions. It is to be remembered tliat so far, at any rate, as Poweit is concerned if there is no c r.trol over the import of shotguns and shotgun cartridges a very lar e number will almost certainly be imported for re-export by smugglers to Iraq, Persia and Saudi Arabia. shot guns and shotgun ammunition can be used effectively in civil dist rbances and if any armed rising occurs in any of the countries mentioned and it is found that the rebels are largely armed v/ith weapons fund ammunition supplied by Great Britain vi/i b'cit, it will be ;ore than a little e- i^rassing to us ^ 'oho .se the ccntrol of the arms traffic as one of the inntija arguments to justify oui special ^sition in tine l^ersian Gulf.

No, 1191-3 Please refer to India Office Express Letter No. Ext^1139/47 y dated the 2nd June, 1947 regarding the export of arms and ammunition to Kuwait. 2. At first sight I do not consider that the relaxation of requirements in respect of shot guns and shot gun cartridges can he justified merely by the consideration mentioned by the Board of Trade. It has to be remembered that so far at any rate as Kuwait is concerned if there is no control over the import of shot guns and shot gun cartridges a very large number will almost certainly be P. imported for re-export by smugglers to Iraq, Persia and Saudi Arabia. So far as goods other than arms and ammunition are concerned I feel it is up to these countries to take proper preventive measures and that we have no responsibility for limiting imports to Kuwait. Shot guns and shot gun ammunition can however be nsed effectively in civil disturbances - and I feel that if any armed rising occurs in any of the three countries mentioned and it is found that the rebels are largely armed with weapons and ammunition supplied by Great Britain via Kuwait we, who use the control of the arms traffic as one of our main arguments to justify our special position in the Gulf, will look rather foolish. 3 . I may however have misjudged the position and if it is considered that there is no danger of the kind described to be apprehended from the uncontrolled import of shot guns and shot ammunition to Kuwait I shall only be too glad to see the control of such imports removed both to increase British trade and keep the Kuwait merchants happy.

With reference to your letter of th e 15th April about the export of shot gun cartridges to Kuwait, I am afraid that the pre-war practice of asking for a *No objection* certificate in respect of applications submitted to the Board for the export of arms and ammunition to Kuwait and Bahrein was inadvertently dropped early in the war, and has not been followed now for at least six years. There is no supply objection to unlimited exports of shot guns and shot gun cartridges, and it is for consideration whether in present circumstances it is necessary to revert to the pre-war practice in regard to these particular types of arms and ammunition. We are most anxious to avoid introducing any obstacle, however slight, in the way of such a lucrative export trade. There may be special considerations, e.g. of a political nature, which necessitate a reversion to pre-war practice, but we shall be glad if due weight can be given to our view before such a step is taken. As regards the export of military arms and ammunition and (for the moment at any rate) of explosives generally, werare guided by Coombes with a a ^ ^ . 1!-r£KK.Harrison, Esq., /whom India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.whom no doubt you will be able to make such arrangements as may be necessary to obtain your agreement or otherwise before export licences are granted. In the case of naval equipment * and aircraft and aircraft engines, we are guided by the Admiralty and the Ministry of Supply (Air 4B) respectively; but could, in the unlikely event of equipment of these kinds being exported to Bahrein or Kuwait, readily arrange for the India Office to be consulted before any export licence is granted. The control on the export of arms ammunition and aircraft is exercised under the provisions of the Export of G-oods (Control) Consolidation Order 1946, dated October 12th, 1946 (S.R.&amp; 0.1946 No.1661) issued by the Board of Trade under the powers conferred upon them by Section I of the Import, Export &amp; Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939. The particular passages in the Order v/hich specifically relate to arms etc. will be found under paragraph 3(d) and (e) and 9, and under Group 17 of the First Schedule.

The application is endorsed by I.C.I. Ltd as follows 'Sold by us to authorized and licensed dealers for. normal ca mp ergial sales mainly for sporting purposes' but no details of 4 the ultimate pur chasers or of the end use can be ascertained from the applicants. -■ The proposal seems at first sight quite trivial and harmless but on consideration we think it is curious enough to warrant bringing it tfc&gt; your notice. A Percussion cap is not lethal in itself and is used for mere noise-making (e.g» toy pistols etc) but generally speaking it functions as an initiating explosive for lethal caarges. . way percussion caps have an industrial or civilian x^lfeworks, Demolition, Blasting etc., but these uses can course, be of military or non-industrial character. However, in connection with cartridges as in the pre sent application, one percussion cap goes to one cartridge and from this anrle it appears that a substantial amount of ammunition is involved in the proposed export if the caps are to be used for the purpose to be inferred f om the description given in the application.We have no knowledge of any export to this consignee of any cartridge is themselves nor do we know of any cartridge making factory in KUWAIT. While 16&amp; calibre is a normal sporting type of ammunition, .303 is mainly military but can, of course, be used for sporting purposes with *303 rifles. On the other hand the sporting facilities in KUWAIT appear meagre whilst the arming of nat lifts or the re-export to neighbouring countries e.g. Palestine,Transjordan etc may be in volved. 1 In the circumstances it seems proper to refer th&amp; Wise to the political department concerned before the licence is approved.

The Political Resident subsequently telegraphed agreeing to this. In the circumstances, perhaps you would be good enough to send a further letter to Inperial Chemical Industries Ltd., telling them that the whole order for the 10,000 cartridges should stand after all.

Dear With reference to our conversation regarding the Bahrein Government’s enquiries for ammunition. The position is as follows: On 14th September Dalrymple Belgrave, in his capacity as Adviser to the Bahrein Government, wrote to the Soley Armament Go., Ltd. , stating that he had been instructed by H. H. the Ruler of Bahrein to enquire whether the Company could supply a further 400 rifles of similar pattern and type to those previously purchased, and 800,000 rounds of ammunition. The Soley Go. have asked the War Office v/hether the 800,000 rounds of S. A. A. from surplus War Office stocks can be sold to the firm to enable them to supply Bahrein. The War Office are willing to sell this amount to the Soley Co. provided it is resold to Bahrein. Before informing the Company to this effect we would like to know whether the India Office v/ould have any objection to the sale of this ammunition to Bahrein. 2. We are not concerned with the question of the rifles asked for, as Soleys have them in stock and presumably, if Bahrein decides to purchase, an export license will be applied for in the ordinary way. 3. I might add that in his letter of 14th September Dalrymple Belgrave asked whether Soleys could supply a small number of Bren guns, and for a quotation. J. P.

Reference your letter to Cawthorn, P.Z.4676/38 dated 6th July, 1938 and our telephone conversation on Saturday the 30th July. The following extract from a letter from Messrs. B.S.A. Guns, Ltd. indicates that a 'No objection' certificate of later date than the one quoted by the Political Resident to the Persian Gulf in his Express letter No.1160/9/17 dated the 21st June, 1938, has now been issued by the Political Agents in Bahrain to cover the purchase by Qatar of 225,000 rounds of ..303 ammunition instead of 22500. 'We have now received the order for the rifles and 225,000 rounds of ammunition. In view of the second paragraph of your letter we are holding up acceptance of the order for ammunition until we hear from you that we may accept the order. In this connection we have before us the 'No objection Certificate', issued by the Political Agents, Bahrain, on behalf of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. This Certificate is No.C/403 and dated the 20th June, 1938, and specifically mentions 225,000 Rounds of .303 ammunition. In view of the above perhaps you will kindly agree to the supply of 225,000 rounds and we shall be glad to hear from you on this point quickly to enable us to finally accept the order.' You agreed that under the circumstances there would be no objection from your point of view to Messrs. B.S.A. accepting this order.

Yours faithfully,Mr. GlaUson, iJtMsU fa M*/^ ^ ffa ^ tiTftt , Afo Import of Arms into the Arab States of the . » Persian Gulf. (Note: I have taken a copy of this for Bushire file). • C *■ rfvv • iti/+ You will remember we discussed this question yesterday. The position is that before the Shaikh of Bahrain, or any other Persian Gulf Shaikh, can buy arms or ammunition from India, or any other British possession, (and I supnose the same applies to this country), he must get a No Objection Certificate from me as Resident. But this safeguard is only in force because the Government of India Rules (and the Rules of the other British authorities concerned) lay down that arms and ammunition cannot be exported without this Certificate, i.e. there is nothing in our Treaties with Persian Gulf Rulers regarding a Certificate. If therefore any Ruler chose to import arms from a foreign country, e.g. Germany or Italy, this check of a certificate would not apply. We might not hear of the arrival of a consignment from a foreign country (e.g. Germany: the Hansa Line call regularly at the Persian Gulf ports) until after it had been landed, as the Shaikh concerned could order it privately. There is in our Treaties, however, a stipulation that arms and ammunition should only be imported lor the use of the Shaikh, and not for sale or re-export. If therefore the consignment was at all a large one we could take the line with the Shaikh concerned that his importation was obviously too large for his legitimate requirements. 2. In the case under consideration, 50,000 rounds of .303 for Bahrain. These are required for the Armed Police of the State (150 in number) and to the best of my recollection 1 sanctioned it at the time. 3. l rather think (in connection with para.2 above) that the Shaikhs are under the salutaiy impression that they have to get No Objection Certificates for all arms imports, whether/whether from foreign countries or otherwise, and we need not of course disillusion them, 4. As far as Qatar is concerned, the Shaikh has the right by his Treaty to import the large quantity of 500 Kvv. rifles for ammunition* The other aay, hot 1 /ever, when he wished to get rifles and ammunition (1'ipearmc which were of a bore (not *303)) which did not suit us, we informed him that he could not do this: (a) Because when H.M.G, promised him protection (in return for his giving the oil concession in the right quarter) it was stipulated that we expected from him n all reasonable assistance” in case of hostilities. (b) Because in the Arms clause of his Treaty it was laid down that the arms should be obtained from the Muscat Arms store, or other place approved of by H.M.G., and we did not approve of the quarter whence he proposed to get his German supplies.THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his &lt;s&amp;i the Secretary of ^ transmits herewith cor&gt;^^' of the under-mentioned paper. compliments to and, by direction the Secretary of State, Foreign Office, /f . 193/' Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure.

I hasten to make it clear that in applying to you for assistance in this case it was not the intention of the Company to introduce the principle of obtaining any future import licences into Bahrein through the medium of the India Office but that the usual and normal course wiril always be followed. It was only the urgency of the matter which led me to think that I might be able to invoke your aid on this particular occasion. I am personally gratified to learn that my belief in your willingness to assist the Company in its development of the oil resources of the Bahrein Islands was justified. More particularly is this so because the India Office is not really concerned in trans actions of this kind and it dealt with the matter in a prompt and gen erally a thoroughly satisfactory manner. The Company is indeed grate ful to the India Office for its help. M.
