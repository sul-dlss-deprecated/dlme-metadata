My dear Metcalfe, Subject Defence of the Persian Gulf &gt;iQ . in times of war. M yf !X/ ^ Could you please refer to my Express letter No. C/l45 of the 21st March 1^38 in which I gave the details of a rather serious agitation at Debai which had arisen recently against the deportation of two gun-runners, and against our policy of manumitting slaves who apply to us for manumission. The agitation against the latter proce dure, which has been in force for many years, came about owing to the large increase of such applications which have been made to us in the last few months. There is of course no question of our giving up our policy of manumission, but the last reports from Debai indicated that the situation was quieter. / 7S 2. This agitation, however, raises in a somewhat acute form the defence of the Trucial Coast section of the Air Route to India. (See paragraphs 23-24 of Note enclosed with my letter No.C/14 of 18th January). If in the present instance drastic action to quell the agitation has been necessary, or may still be necessary, such as preventing by a sloop the Debai pearling fleet going to sea, before we put such action into force we should have to consider the safety of the Imperial Airways flying boats, which, as you are aware, land some eight times or so a week at Debai for refuelling. As a reply to such action on our part the local malcontents might retaliate by shooting up a flying boat or two Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE., CSI., MVO., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, NEW DELHI.- 2 - two, (nothing is more helpless than a civil flying boat on the water), or render their landing difficult or impossible by anchoring dhows or small boats in the 'fairway.* Wtait applies to an agitation in time of peace applies still more to a situation which arise in time of war. I have already referred (see paragraphs 8(2) and 26(1) of my Note quotedabove) to the very effective use made by our enemies in the last War of capable agents at Bushire and Muscat. I see no reason to suppose that in the next war, (if it comes), our enemies will not try and employ the same means, only at Debai and Sharjah, say, instead of at Bushire. There is always an opposition party to every Shaikh on the Trucial Coast, and generally an opposition party in every Sheikhdom which is more or less hostile to us, and it would not be difficult for agents well supplied with funds, and operating from the Trucial Coast hinterland, to stij^up the local malcontents to interfere with the Air Route. 4. In so far as Debai is concerned, it s eems to me per sonally that from the defence point of view the Airways* station is particularly vulnerable. The alighting area is in a lagoon between which and the sea lies the town. The area is out of sight of the sea, and therefore even if a sloop were available for defence purposes, which apparently is not the case (see paragraph 2(2) of my Note), any effect ive action could be extremely difficult. The creeks at ei ther Umm al Qaiwain or Has al Khaimah would seem to be pre ferable from the defence aspect, and if these have not been definitely ruled out for Imperial Airways* Flying Boats I suggest that they be reconsidered. Imperial Airways have not yet committed themselves to Debai, and the persent temporary-3- temporary agreement with the Shaikh expires in July. 6 * 1 have discussed the above with Weightman who has visited Debai and who entirely concurs with my views. * I am sending copies of this letter to Seyoraur, Walton, Courtney and Poland.

Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Kuwait. Dated the 18th January 1938. Subject ; Defence of the Persian Gulf in the event of a major war. My dear Walton, You will remember that just before I left London I attended a Meeting of an Interdepartmental Committee v/hich discussed the subject of legislation for the Persian Gulf (i.e. the Arab side) in the event of a major war. In due course the recommendations of the Committee will doubtless take their final form, and our war legislation scheme can then be put away in a drawer ready to be pulled out when and if the emergency arises. 2. A cognate question which has been somewhat excercising my mind since my return is whether a similar scheme exists for the defence of the Gulf in the event of a major war, co-ordinating the activities of the Naval, Military, Royal Air Forcejand local Political Authorities ? If so I have not seen it, and presumably the co-operation of the Resident would be required to assist in the carrying out of the scheme. If a such a scheme does not exist then I suggest that the matter be laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence or whatever is the appropriate body, so that one may be drawn up. I quite realise that owing to the special conditions prevailing in the Gulf it may not be possible to draw in ad vance hard and fast plans such as is possible in other parts of the world where/ J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., The India Office, London*- 2 - ©;3 where we have importantstrategical interests. At the same time some sort of scheme is better than none, and I enclose a Note on which such a scheme might be based. Even if a scheme already exists perhaps this Note may be of use on certain points. jMetcalfe may like to give a copy of this letter and the Note to Army Headquarters). 3. There is one point in connection with my Note v/hich I wish to make perfectly clear . lou will see that in regard to the defence of certain areas in the Gulf I have asked: Is it intended to send troops ? Can arrangements be made against a possible attack from the air, or from the sea ? and so forth. Some of these questions may appear rather wild, and to answer themselves in the negative, but I have posed them deliberately in order to get definite decisions. In putting these questions therefore I do not for a minute mean to suggest that troops should be sent to any particular area, or that arrangements in that area against air or naval attack are imperative. These are questions which must be decided by higher authorities with due regard to the heavy respnsibi- lities which the Services, in the event of a major war, will have to meet in other areas. The object of my Note indeed is not to advocate the assumption of unnecessary defence commitments in the Gulf, but to try and ensure that we should avoid them. During the Great War I served as a Political officer in the Gulf, Iraq (Mesopotamia as it was then) and Persia, and looking back I cannot help feeling that ifin this part of the world we had planned a little more ahead in time of peace, we would in time ofWar have been saved many unnecessary and costly commitments e.g. in Persia. (See for instance paragraph 8 (2) of my Note). 4 /4. lou will see that in my Note 1 have included details which are of course perfectly well-known to you, as well as to Seymour, Metcalfe, Courtney and Poland.

(1) nushire . Sir Trenchard said that it seemed desirable to decide, in advance? what action we should taxe in the event of a major emergency, i.e. whether we should send reinforcements or evacuate. The Par Office representative thought that with heavy calls elsewhere it would be extremely difficult in the early stages to spare troops for Bushire. Colonel Banbury agreed with this view. The Arlmi 1 t.v/•2 / 2 . Admiralty and Air 5’orce representatives said tnat tney were not in favour of having any commitments at Bushire. Provisional conclusion. It was unnecessary to prepare __ / plans for sending armed forces to Bushire. (2) Ganoweh - M i shu n - G-ach Qaragnuli . This area is not included in the '^hadan' scheme and the forces scheduled for the defence of the Abadan area would not be large enough to include the Ganoweh area. Provisione . 1 Gonclusion . -i.s things stand at present it is unnecessary to prepare a scheme for the s Ganoweh area. (3) Lingah - Jasl: - Charbar . It was agreed that no importance need be attached to these places and that they could be abandoned in the event of an emergency. ( 4 ) Bandar Abba s. Here again it was agreed that we had no important interest to 'protect and that the place could be abandoned. ( 3 ) ^rab side of the Pers ian Gulf . .iir Trenchard Fowle emphasised the importance of protecting (a) present and future oil interests and (b) the air route. The -xir Ainistry representative said that responsibility for the defence of the whole of the Arab side of the Gulf rested on the A.O.C., Iraq,. It was generally agreed that the chief danger of attack would come from v/andering tribes and that it was unnecessary to provide against major intervention. Captain Edelston stated that the admiralty attached considerable importance to adequate measures being taken to prevent acts of sabotage./3 sabotage. (6) Koweit . The meeting was of opinion that consideration should be given t &gt; the question of keeping a reasonable store of arms, perhaps in Iraq in reserve and to the drawing up of a scheme for, the rapid expansion of the existing forces at the Sheikh's disposal. Sir Trenchard Fov/le did not think that the Sheikh would be prepared to give any financial assistance though no doubt he would be quite willing to cooperate in other ways. (7) Bahrei n. As Bahrein is an island the chief danger would come from the sea. _ Captain Edelston thought, however, that ft-was—un nkely that-enemy ships would geA- into -the- Persian Gulf and- that in any case there was already--in existence an-g,de.qaate- ochcffle for the- •&amp;nat ^tne V — WQll 1 (i-— Q ~h~l 43 -h n r\- ^a T.T-i -!-Vi Q -mr Q ■f‘ T&gt; O - r ma^a-geid to getr-into t4ie Culfh-^. The ^j.ir Ministry representative said that except for attack from Persia, Bahrein could be regarded as immune from air attack. The danger from such attack from Saudi Arabia was remote. This also applied to Hassawa. Sir Trenchard Powle said that from his point of view one question on which he would like an answer was whether any further land defences were/k. v/ere necessary. Captain Edelston said that shore batteries were not recommended by the Naval authorities and he did not think that they were necessary. Ihe Air Ministry and Jar Office representatives agreed. Major Mallaby said that in any case it was extremely unlikely that A.-, guns could be supplied for a very long time. Sir Trenchard Powle said he thought that it would be possible to raise locally a sufficient force to guard the aerodromes, oil fields, etc., but expert advice would be needed. A reserve stock of arms etc. might also be desirable and at Sir Trenchard Powle f s suggestion it was agreed to be desirable that an officer (perhaps deputed by the A.O.C., Iraq.) should be sent to Bahrein to investigate the position a.nd to formulate a scheme. Sir Trenchard Powle said that he thought that the Sheikh might be willing to help in the purchase of arms and provide storage facilities; he might also be willing to contribute towards the cost of the guards. (8) Qatar . It was agreed that in present circumstances no special defence measures were required though guards would be necessary to protect the oil field, if oil is discovered. It was agreed that the question of forming a local defence force would fall within the sphere of the A.O.C., Iraq. Sir Trenchard Powle said he did not think that the Ruler would be prepared to contribute anything. (9) Trucial Coast . The chief problem here was the defence of landing/5 . landing grounds etc. on the air route. Internal security measures would he required at Shargah and Debai and it was agreed that a scheme should be worked out between the Political Resident and the A.O.C., Iraq. (10) M usc at. Sir Trenchard Powle pointed out that during the Great \7ar we had sent a large force to help the Sultan to repel an attack from the Omanis of the interior; and he thought that a decision as to whether assistance should be given in the event of a similar attack during a future emergency should be arrived at. The Air Ministry representative said that under present circumstances they would like to see Muscat kept free from disorder. The !7ar Office representative pointed out that this might only be possible if troops were available and that what seemed required was to have a store of arms and ammunition available for use in an emergency. It was agreed that the question of forming a scheme, in cooperation with the Sultan, for the expansion of the local force in the event of an emergency should be considered and Sir Trenchard Powle suggested that a Service expert should be sent to Muscat for this purpose. In reply to Sir Trenchard Powle the Admiralty and Air Ministry representatives stated that there was no real danger of attack by sea or air and that it was unlikely that the Muscat coasts would be used for shelter by enemy craft. (Intld. ) C. 3 . 3. India Office 14th April, 1938flu SECRET. Mr, Peel . Re the informal interdepartmental meeting held on the 14th April on the subject of the defence of the Persian Gulf in the event of a major war. 2. I think the meeting was a very useful one and elicited a number of important opinions, subject of course to these opinions being confirmed by the various higher authorities concerned. 3. The most important provisional conclusions were the following general ones:- ^ 'V'? (a) (see para. 20 ( ^ of my Note enclosed with my letter No.C.14 of Office). 18th January last to the India That in the opinion of the Admiralty the contingency of a hostile cruise rye n»o ring-1 n c Gulf in time of war was so remote that it need not be considered. (This covered the possibility of a cruiser bombarding Muscat and also, subject to further investigation, the possibility of a cruiser or submarine using the Muscati coast between Has Musandum and Salala as a temporary base (see para. 28 of my Note)). The Admiralty considered, however, that a raider (disguised merchant vessel) or large submarine might attempt to enter the Gulf, but that such craft could be dealt with by the sloops of the Persian Gulf division. &gt;• (b) (see para, 2 (3) of my Note) That in the opinion of the Air Ministry the Gulf was so remote from the bases of our potential enemies that the possibility of air attack could9 be ruled out. The only exception to this was if hostile bases were established in Persia. 4. It followed from the above that in the opinion of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry no defences need be organised in the Gulf against naval or air attacks. This, combined with the decision not to send troops to either the Persian or Arab side of the Gulf (see paras 5 (d) and (e) and para. 6 below), clears the ground enormously and only leaves us with schemes of defence and internal security to be organised locally (see paras. 7 to 11 below). I had thought (vice para. 3 of my letter of 18th January) that some at least of the queries contained in my Note answered themselves in the negative, but it is a distinct advantage to have had those dealing with the possibilities of naval and air attack answered now by the competent authorities. As we all know problems assume a different aspect when considered quietly in peacetime from that which they take on in the stress of war. If, for instance, the problem of the defence of Bushire had been considered before the Great Mar at some such meeting as we have now had, it is difficult to believe that the mistake (in my opinion) would have been made of tying up a whole division there- to deal with Wassmuss and his Persian tribesmen. 5 . The other provisional conclusions were as follows:- (c) (see para. 7 of my Note). The Ganowen-Mi shun-Gach Q.aragnuli area was not included in the Abadan defence scheme, and it was doubtful whether it would be possible to draw up any scheme for its defence. (d) (see para. 8 of my Note). Bushire. It was agreed that no troops could be sent/3 . 8 ./ sent to Bushire to meet the threat of attack, and if this threat proved serious enough the only step was evacuation. (e) (see paras. 9 to 10 of my Bote). The other small Gulf ports . The same conclusion was come to as for Bushire. 6. To turn to the Arab side. The general conclusion come to was that in view of the heavy commitments v/hich would fall on our troops in other areas in a major war there would be none to spare to send to the Arab states. These included Muscat. 7. To consider the Arab States one by one. Koweit . (see paras. 16 to 17 of my Note). The suggestion made in para. 17 (3) of my Note to the effect that the Sheikh might be encouraged to assist in his own defence was generally approved of. I pointed out that owing to the recent finding of oil at Kov/eit, though in what quantities was not yet certain, the problem of Koweit defence was now both more important and more difficult as the oilfields, if these materialised, would be at some distance from the town and thus be open to sabotage by Bedouin, especially if in the meantime Ibn Saud's strong control had been removed by his death. I said I would be glad to have the assistance and expert advice of an officer for drawing up a scheme of local defence. The Air Ministry suggested that, since the Air Officer Commanding Iraq was responsible for the defence b 3 ^ land of the Arab side, such an officer might well be detailed by him subject of course to his views. This would suit me admirably.A • Bahrein . (see paras. 13 to 21 of my Note). Here of course, unlike at Eoweit, there is no oj-iestion of a land attack on Bahrein. On the other hand we have an oilfield and refinery which lend themselves to internal sabotage from enemy agents (see para. 21 (1) of my Note). The Admiralty representative emphasized that it was this kind of hostile activity of which the Admiralty were especially apprehensive. Here again I would be glad of the services of an officer from the Air Officer Commanding to assist in considering a scheme of internal security. I have no doubt whatever that the Bahrein letroleum Company would co-operate wholeheartedly in any such scheme. Qatar . (see para. 22 of my Note). If the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, desires any scheme of co-operation with the Sheikh to be considered I shall of course be very pleased to assist. At present the Petroleum Concessions Limited are merely carrying out exploratory drilling. If, however, they strike oil then the same problems of local defence for an oilfield will arise as at Koweit. fre T rucial Coast . (see paras. 23 to 24 of my Note). A scheme for the local defence of Sharjah was worked out some years ago by the Air Officer Commanding Iraq and myself. Perhaps this scheme might now be overhauled to see if it needs amendments. At the meeting the question of the local defence of Debai was also raised. This could likewise be gone into by the Air Officer Commanding and myself. 11* Musc at. (see paras. 25 to 27 of my Note). Tne Air Ministry representative gave the opinion that Muscat was of importance from the K.A.P. point of view since/since it was an i D. since it v/as an important station on the Aden-Muscat- Karachi route. With regard to considering a scheme of local defence against a possible incursion of the Omanis, it was suggested that the A.O.C. Iraq might detail an officer for this purpose. Naturally the co-operation of the Sultan would have to be secured but as such a scheme would be in his interest I do not anticipate difficulties in this direction. 12* Oil . (1) On this subject I cannot help feeling that the undoubted importance of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's oil supply at Abadan has perhaps somewhat overshadowed the importance both actual and potential of oil on the Arab coast. Looking into the future it is by no means fantastic to envisage a series of oilfields, each perhaps as large as the one at Bahrein, stretching from Koweit to Muscat. In this case the Arab coast would become one of the largest oil producing areas in the world, an area moreover - and this is the essential factor from the strategical point of view - under our control. The great disadvantage of course of the Abadan supply is that it lies in a foreign country by no means under our control. Even the present situation with a large oilfield at Bahrein ana at least fair prospects of two others at Koweit and Kasa (where oil has been found recently) is of considerable significance (A Hasa oilfield would be in Saudi territory, but since by reason of the geographical position of Hasa transport to the outer world could not be effected during a major war without our sanction, doubtless some arrangement as to pre-emption rights of purchase could be come to). (2) I emphasized at the meeting and in my Note (see para.14 (2)) a point which appears to me personally of great/gre at imp ortanc e. 6. In case of danger to the Abadan oil works a scheme would be put into effect for sending a force there to guard them. Before, however, this force can arrive and function a period must elapse. During this period it may be that no oil will be forthcoming and in any case, as I understand it, the scheme does not cover the protection of the 150 miles or so of pipe line from the oilfields to Abadan. It is possible, therefore, that in the event of a major war, for a time our only supply of oil from the Gulf will be from the Arab side. This contingency obviously greatly increases the importance of oil on that side and especially as things stand at present at Bahrein. Among other considerations it would seem essential that arrangements should be made with the Bahrein Petroleum Company for a supply of fuel up to naval and B.A.F. standards. At present sloojjs of the Persian Gulf division still have to go from their base at Bahrein to Abadan to obtain their fuel supply. I understand, however, that conversations are proceeding between the Admiralty and the Bahrein Petroleum Company on the subject of a local fuel supply. In this connection the following extract from a letter from Mr. Weightman, the Political Resident, Bahrein, who is acting as Political Resident, received by me to-day, is of interest 'There is a very strong pro-British feeling among the 'higher command at Bapco which has been even more noticeable lately since the arrival of Mr. Thornberg, their Vice President. He has, on various occasions, remarked that the Company realise that they depend entirely on British protection against any possible aggression and it seems that they are genuinely anxious to do what they can/7. can to help. An obvious diroction is in the supply of fuel for His Majesty's ships and B.A.F. and Imperial Airways aircraft at Bahrain, and I have the most definite assurances that they would produce the required fuel in a very short time if it were wanted. The hint has also been dropped to me that existing contracts need not be regarded as an insuperable bar. He tells me that it is by no means uncommon for one oil company to take over part of another's contract, and that Bapco would 'fix it' with A.I.O.C., with whom they are on excellent terms. There may, of course be a certain amount of American bluff about this, but I must confess I don't think there is very much. After all the amount of the fuel used by the sloops or by R.A.F. and Imperial Airways machines at Bahrain is not so very great, and as a purely business proposition I doubt if it would be attractive. On the other hand the advantages from our point of view seem fairly considerable. We should have a reserve source of oil supply for H.M. 7 s Forces in existence ready for war. In peace it means increased mobility for the sloops; it means a saving on R.A.F. supplies (which pay Bahrain customs); and it means the end of friction over Imperial Airways refund of customs.' I will be grateful if you would circulate this Rote to the Departments concerned. I am keeping a copy for my own reference. (Sgd.) T. C. Fowle. 19th April, 1938.P.Z.3128/1938 s^wr. S.40564. AIK MiKISTKY, m Adastral House, Kingsway, fo.C.2. 3rd May 1^38. Dear Peel, I have no comments to make on the minutes of the discussion which we had concerning the appropriate defence measures to be undertaken in the Persian Gulf. I do dot intend to send a complete copy of the minutes to the A.O.G. Iraq, and I think it will be sufficient to send him a resume of the Conclusions to which we agreed. I intend to inform him that the possibility of any commiCrnents (apart from the defence scheme of the Anglo- Iranian oil fields) on the eastern sideof the Persian Gulf is most remote. On the western side the threat of any attack from the sea or from the air is slight and we would not at present be justified in making any provision for fixed defences against sea or air attack. Our immediate aim should be to develop whatever local resources there are in order to offset the possibility of tribal attack from the landward side, and of sabotage both in the Bahrain oil fields and at those places which are staging points on the Iraq-India and Iraq-Aden air routes. I, also propose to tell the A.O.C. that we are asking him tosend an officer to assist in drawing up defence plans for Kuwait, Bahrain, Sharjah and muscat. It is obviously desirable that this officer’s visit to tie Gulf should take place after Sir Trenchsrd Fowls 1 s return. We will therefore tell the A.O.C. that he may expect in the course of time to te ar from the K.P.G. suggesting arrangements by which collaboration on drawing up defence plans for the places mentioned can best be achieved. Perhaps you will be good enough to inform Sir Trenchard Fowle of the action we propose to take. Yours sincerely, Sd. W.A.Coryton. R.T.Peel, Hsq., tt.C.

I am writing this In ranhor a hurry as I am off early Yours sincerely, sd. T*C.Fowle Captain A* Po' m ~ A riQAWith reference to your D.O. No, C/729 of 1st October, although I have not yet heard from the Commander-in-Chief whether he intends to carry out his original programme, I would like to offer the following remarks regarding the sug gestions contained in your letter. 2 . The proposed exercise is designed to finish when the 'enemy raider' has reached the longitude of 55°S (vicinity of Tunb Is.) and there is no time availabe for an investiga tion into how much damage she could do before being caught. 3. It would be quite possible from my point of view to issue a warning by W/T to the Political Officers on the Arab side of the Gulf that an 'Enemy Haider' had entered and was at large, but I would point out that this warning might reach them at any time during the 48 hours of the exercise and the time of receipt might not be an entirely suitable moment to exercise a 'black out' from the point of view of convenience to the local authorities, and local firms. 4. Apart from exercising com unications between myself and the political authorities, I do not think that there is much to be gained by combining this test with the proposed exercise. A trial of communications can of course be arranged at any time if desired. I suggest also that more value would be obtained from a test 'black out' if aircraft co operation were available to observe the effect. During the proposed exercise all available aircraft will be co-operating with the forces at the entrance to the Gulf. 5. There is one point in connection with communications which I think is worth consideration, and that is that Bah rain Radio does not normally keep a constant watch by day and closes down at night. In the event of war there would almost certainly be none of H.M. Ships at Bahrain and all W/T messages would have to go through Bahrain Radio. I do not/-not know whether any increase of staff is contemplated in an emergency in order to enable a constant watch to be kept day and night, but I should consider it essential. 6 . In conclusion I am quite prepared to co-operate to the extent of issuing the necessary warning at the end of the exercise if you still wish me to do so, in which case I would inform you of the limiting dates when I know them.authorities ptvVkvm looaX iefenes of the 3r*fe itatoo« 1 *44ad setts eoie^oxito on the Oefonee of Kuasit* l sent an short loaf* to -^Xand on the End u^ust# Out ittstruotod itX&amp;htmmn she was to aet for »e as ^oXitioaX Kosident to to the Air Officer Commanding follow sqt letter up with oasssutt feat tens from hls^jfiTin^ hie w!ewe an the local defence of Bahrain* 3»tar* the fruotal Coast* and &gt;iuee*t» this eightaan did wery thorougiOy in hie letters if#»*q/e02» dated the 4th August iP3g t 0/6X2* datsd the 8th August X05d* 3/dl&amp;* dated ths dth august i960* and q/528* dated the 9th uagust 6« fhi the l&amp;tfc aeptemher &gt;eightaaan* who in the aeaaUae had tahes up the question ef local defence at Bahrain in lie most tatsortent aspect • protection of the Jil ?Xeld and refinery, telegraphed to the Air Officer Cemmand%ng referring to hie ( foightaas^s) letter of 4tn /uigaat* isformlng hix that the Bahrain PotroleuMi CSttpany had prepared their plans and wee# anxious at out ettaining o&lt;*ui paisa t require at a«ce.

Price and Jope-Slade are here at the moment and things are going on very well. We are all convinced that the main necessity is to form a local volunteer corps and that will be the main item in Price’s appreciation. He is going to recommend the posting of a permanent adjutant here who will also be able to tour to Kuwait, Tatar (if development there necessitates it), Sharjah and Muscat. V.e know that we shall get 40 or 60 volunteers from the Oil Camp without the least difficulty, and if the thing is run properly the numbers ought to increase rapidly. 3. The procedure, unless you have any objection, is that Price will prepare his appreciation end show it to the Air Officer commanding for preliminary approval when he gets back to Hab ani- yah. He will then send a copy to me for any additions or comments necessary and I will submit these to you. Price seems to be a first rate xellox; and as the Bahrain Petroleum Company have put in a greet deal of eally good work on preparing a new scheme of protection, with which Price is greatly impressed, I think we ought to have something quite useful to send to you before long. 4. I told the Shaikhs this morning that Price is here and they were tremendously interested and said th?t they wanted to co-operate to the utmost of their ability. From what Price says we may even be able to get them some T, ren .guns before long. 6. I am going down to Sharjah via ater with Price tomorrow, returning by Imperial Airways on Wednesday morning.

Persian Gulf Defence My dear Fowle, It is understood that the defence schemes for the Arab States of the Gulf now under preparation by the Air Officer Commanding Iraq will, after they have been vetted by the Air Ministry, be brought before a Committee of Imperial Defence sub-Committee, on which the India Office are represented. We shall want, at that stage, to know whether the Government of India and the Indian G-eneral Staff, have any views on the schemes which should be put before the sub-Committee,4nd therefore, to avoid any unnecessary delay, we think they should have an opportunity of seeing the draft schemes as soon as they are ready, and sending their comments to us. You will no doubt receive a copy of the schemes from the lir Officer Commanding Iraq, and the Air Ministry would raise no objection to your sending a copy to India, provided that you do so demi-officially and that it is clearly understood by all concerned that the schemes as submitted by the Air Officer Commanding are only provisional and are subject to the examination and approval of the Air Ministry. ill you kindly proceed accordingly.

Sir, I have the honour to say that I have been instructed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to reply to the questionnaire attached to your letter No. E.I. 3041/3 dated the 13th December 1938 addressed to the Political Resident, as further elucidated in your telegram No. 0352 dated the 25th February 1939. 2. I attach to this letter replies to each part of the questionnaire, based on returns submitted, by tne )irector of Customs. The essential commodities listed have o en selected with strict reference to local requirements and omit such items as animals for slaughter which are normally brought into Bahrain by local craft. They omit also all materials required for the maintenance or expansion of the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany 1 s Field and Refinery, partly because extensive stores are maintained here and partly because such imports as might be necessary would, in the event of a world war, presumaoly be imported in tankers. 3. In regard to item (d) in the questionnaire I regret that I have insufficient technical knowledge to estimate the total registered tonnage required to supply the needs of the community./-61 ) 'A D - 2 - community* Allowing for war time conditions I assume that the monthly cargo tonnage would be roughly 1300, though I venture to submit the suggestion that if circumstances so required the whole of this tonnage could be carried in empty tankers return ing from India. This however would involve setting up some purchasing organisation at Bombay or Karachi. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to the Staff Officer (Intelligence), Colombo, (No. C/189) and to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf (No. C/190).

In connection with the appreciation concerning SHARJAH and HTBAI, paragraph 30 (c) and 31, the Honourable Political Resident has requested that an officer should proceed to SHARJAH to examine the question of water and food supplies should a force arrive from INDIA. You are to proceed to SHARJAH at your earliest ~ f convenience to look into the question of local fool resources and A ~ render a report. It can be taken that a self-contained platoon v might consist of 1 British officer and 30 Indian other ranks while a Company might include 2 British officers and 150 Indian other ranks. The water situation is known at these Headquarters. It is known that the condenser plant in SHARJAH Fort can produce at least 240 gallons per day in emergency. This is sufficient to carry on with even if the wells were cut off, whicn would be unlikely if a force of one company were available, since a force of this strength could probably provide escorts for water parties to and from the wells. 4 # in connection with paras. 11 and 22 of the above Appreciation you are also to proceed to KHOH QGVAI to carry out a recon iaissance and report on its suitability as an alternative to DIB.AI in emergency. 5 # With reference to the QATAR Appreciation, paras. 12 and 20 , you are to proceed to the oil fields area to select a possible landing ground.

FO'/'AY# 3 # As a result of these discussions it v/as agreed that KHOR QUtfAI is quite suitable as an alighting area for nodera flying boats of types similar to the Imperial /airways 'Empire” flying boats. Under certain circumstances this alighting area might be diffi&lt;rult for old type flying boats such as the A.A.F. “Singapore” tyoo. This would occur when there was a swell and no r/ind, but Commander RLLISOU did not consider that these conditions would prevail very frequently. 4.

W.R.Hay* Deputy Secretary to the Government of India* tCopy of a note by the Chief of the General Staff in India on the subject of the Defence schemes prepared by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the Arab Gulf States* The General Staff have the following comments to offer *- (a) That the potential military commitment mi ht be lessened if the Rulers concerned could be induced to tighten up all possible legal and executive measures to deal with'individual agitators within their borders, and to improve the standard of their local forces, increasing their strength, when practicable, on the outbreak of war# (b) That any reinforcement to the Gulf area from India must be found from within the troops that have, in consulta tion with the War Office, been allocated to External Defence# In view of the commitments which are at present envisaged for these troops, it appears likely that the acceptance of this additional liability would necessitate an increase in the strength of these forces# In accordance with the recomwendations of the Jhatfield Committee this would require the consent of both His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India# ^ (c) That while we are at present prepared to accept (subject to certain reservations which will be mentioned here after) the strength suggested for reinforcements to be sent from India, we must insure against the possibility of having to rescue, in emergency, small inadequate detachments* It will, therefore, be necessary*, as soon as His Majesty*s Goveriment have decided the recommenda tions they propose to accept, for a further reconnais sance to be carried out both to guard against this risk and to prepare the necessary administrative plans# (d) That the size of the force recommended for despatch to the SHARJAH K)RT -DIBAI area requires further considera tion. A platoon for the static defence of the Fort Itself may be adequate, but it is thought that such a small force might be insufficient to afford the necessary protection, in the event of serious trouble, to the landing ground# Similarly the isolated and somewhat exposed position of DIBAI may need for its protection forces somewhat stronger than are now recommended# j (e) That the task in KUWAIT does not seem suitable for infantry who could do little more than assist in the defence of the Town and/or its water supply# T e essential requirements here seem to be early intellig ence and the power to take the initiative against raiders. This is a task for aircraft and mooile forces, and it is suggested that an armoured cavalry regiment could be used with advantage provided it is possible to get its vehicles ashore.SECRET M 1 *' No.C/325. in the Persian Gulf f Can^), SHIRAZ.
