GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. The Right H on'ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Fort William, the 10th March 1904. In the course of our recent examination of problems connected with the Persian Gulf, the question of the pearl-fisheries that have so long existed there has come under our notice. Important questions, both of policy and international law, are involved; and although none ol these has fortunately hitherto assumed an acute shape, it seems to us desirable that the matter should be considered now, in order that we may know how to act should any sudden expected development occur. We, therefore, address you on the subject. — 2. The approximate limits of the pearling grounds in the neighbourhood of tli/Arab littoral are indicated on the enclosed copy of a chart of the O# In addition to those marked, there are also shoals in the neighbourhood ^ of Kharak Island and at other points along the Persian coast, which are rejdarly exploited and frequently yield considerable returns. We are immediately concerned, however, only with those lying on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Along this coast lie the territories of the several Trucial Chiefs, the peninsula of El Katr, the island of Bahrein, the Turkish province of El I Hassa, and the domains of the Sheikh of Koweit. The pearl banks appear from time immemorial to have been open, without distinction, to the Arabs of the entire littoral; and though there are no definite inter-tribal limits, the external boundaries of the fisheries are well known. Intrusion is resented ; the principal [Hffiiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common pro pertv and that no Chief has, therefore, the right to grant any concession ^Kutside parties; and believing as they do that the shallower waters are IBpendent on the deeper for their supply of shells, their objections relate not to interference on the shoals which are habitually fished by their dependents, but' alsC to the exploitation of the deeper waters beyond. [ 3 His Majesty's Government are aware of the clos^ relations which exist between the Arabs of this coast and the Indian Government. Since 1843 we have held from the Trucial Chiefs agreements to refrain from any breach of the peace at sea, and in 1892 the Sheikhs concluded fresh compacts binding themselves not to enter into anv agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the ^Kish Government; not to consent, except with the permission of the British (lOvernment, to the residence within their territories ol the Agent of any other State • and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give occupation of any portion of their territories, save to the British Government. In respect of El Katr we have at present no formal Conventions. We have declined, however, to recognise Turkish pretensions on the peninsula, and the leading Chief has on more than one occasion approached our officers in the Gulf with a request that he may be admitted t^closer relations with the Indian Government. Bahrein has lor long been to all intents and purposes, a British protectorate ; while in the case of Koweit, though the Turks have laid claim to certain ill-dehntd rights of sovereignty we have always asserted that the Sheikh enjoys a Targe measure ■ practical independence, and His Majesty^ Government have promised him Hfcr o-ood offices. The maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gult is anobject which for more than a century past we have steadily kept in view in our dealings with the Arab tribes. To secure this object we have prohibit the use of armed boats by the Chiefs, and have taken upon ourselves the dut of policing all these waters. A necessary corollary of this policy is that t Chiefs cannot themselves adopt forcible measures for the preservation of th monopoly in connection with the pearl-fisheries. It is clear, therefore, tt we on our part owe to them an obligation to defend their rights so far as th can reasonably be substantiated. This duty carries with it incidentally t advantage that, if our right to police the pearl banks is recognised, a large ai of the Gulf becomes at once practically British waters. 4. In the past we have on more than one occasion intervened to preve the intrusion of foreigners. In 1863 a British steamer appeared in the Gulf v\ trained divers and scientific appliances, but the steps which were at once taken bj the Resident, with the approval of the Bombay Government, sufficed to frustrate the attempted encroachment. In 1874, and again in 1890, His Majesty's Government, on the advice of the Government of India, declined to counte nance proposals made by British companies to exploit the fisheries. In 1894 support was refused to an application by a British subject to the Persian Government for pearling concessions in the Gulf. In 1899, in connection with the alleged grant of certain privileges to two Europeans by the Persian Government, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh was informed by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran that no contract could be recognised which would have the effect of interfering with the rights exercised by Chiefs under British protection In 1901 Sir Nicolas O'Conor, hearing of a project which was under the considera tion of the Porte to tax the fisheries, acquainted Tewfik Pasha with the objections which Her late Majesty's Government saw to any action which would interfere with the prescriptive rights of our protected tribes. In 1902 our local officers declined to countenance the project of a British Indian subject, who proposed to obtain facilities for pearling in Abu Dhabi waters. Finally, in 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that two Frenchmen, named Oumas, and Castelin, had arrived in Bahrein with the intention of prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief refused to entertain their proposal, and subsequently the strangers left the neighbourhood, one for Turkish Arabia, and the other for Jiurope, where it was believed that he intended to engage a professional diver. He has, however, not yet re-appeared. In connection with the last-mentioned case, we have informed our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that we entirely approve Sheikh Esa's attitude, and that, in the ev* nt of either of these Frenchmen returning to Bahrein, the Chief should refuse to render assistance of any description ; that any other Chief who may be similarly approached should return a similar response; and that the Government of India should at once be informed of any renewal of the project or of any like attempt. We enclose, for your information, a copy of the recent correspondence on this subject. 5, We have thus succeeded, hitherto, in staving off outside interference. We recognise, however, that our position in the matter is in certain respects difficult, and that in the future the same success may not attend measures which in the past have sufficed to attain our object. The question involves considerations, firstly, of private, and, secondly, of international law. Our i ights in restraining foreign interference are, it appears to us, at any rate commensurate with those of the Arab tribes concerned, since these have agreed to leave the protection of their interests in our hands; and the question which we may hereafter be called upon to answer, whether in defending a civil suit in a British Court or in meeting an international claim, must be the same, namely, the extent of the rights and jurisdiction possessed by the Arab Chiefs. The chart which we enclose shows that the pear] banks extend to considerable distances from the mainland or from any island. Within the 3-mile limit it seems evident that no difficulty need be encountered, and that the rights over the pearl banks and the jurisdiction required to assert those rights are indisputable. Beyond this zon \ however, the case is less clear. We understand that it has become an uncontested principle of modern international law that the sea, as a general rule, cannot be subjected to 'appropriation. At the same time we believe that it is admitted that portions of the sea may*be affected by proprietary rights on the part of the States whose territories' ft adjoins, and that such rights have 'been moreQ especially recocnised in the case of fisheries, to which the inhabitants of a neighbouring State have established a claim through immemorial exercise of the right of fishing. There can be no doubt that the rights of which they now claim the exclusive enjoyment have been exercised by the Arabs of these coasts from time immemorial; and we consider, therefore, that the fact of these fisheries being in part outside the limits of territorial waters need not necessarily constitute a conclusive bar to the claim. In the pearl- fisheries of Ceylon we have a precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction beyond the 3-mile limit under the Colonial Act of 1811, which authorises the seizure and condemnation of any boat found within the limits of, or hovering near, the pearl banks extending from 6 to 21 miles from the coast; and it may be observed that, in the recent Behring Sea Arbitration, the United States of America cited the Ceylon precedent as justifying their exercise of possession in, and control over, se;il-fisheries beyond the zone of territorial waters as ordinarily recognised by international law. It is also worth noting that the above contention is supported by the authority of the Swiss publicist, Vattel, who in his ' Droit des Gens ' remarked, in discussing the question as far back as the 'eighteenth century, 44 Qui doutera que les pecheries de perles de Bahrein et de Ceylon ne puissent l^gitimement tomber en propriete?' 5 We believe, therefore, that our claim to exclude all foreign pearling vessels from the limits of the fisheries at present worked by the tribes within our protectorate might, if challenged, be defended with a reasonable chance of success. 6. There remains, however, the case of foreign exploitation of deep waters outside the sphere in which we believe that it may be shown that immemorial usage and occupation have conferred prescriptive rights. In this still wider area we doubt whether we possess claims in support of which we could appeal to any law or international practice, and we fear that possible detriment to the pearl banks in which we hold prescriptive rights would furnish no valid ground for objecting to legitimate foreign enterprise outside the sphere of Arab occupation ; but by authorising the Chiefs to abstain from all intercourse with such inter lopers and to utilise the powers which they possess of interdicting the importa tion of foreign diving appliances, of refusing to lend any assistance in men, boais or in any other form, or, if necessary in the last-^esort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories, we might succeed in putting such serious impediments in the way of such enterprises as would discourage outsiders from engaging in them. 7. The question is fortunately not one in which we are at present called upon to decide as to the exact nature of the rights or the precise limits of the jurisdiction which the several Chiefs possess, and which we, as the Paramount Power, are bound to assert and maintain on their behalf; but in view of the possibility of further attempts, whether by British companies or by foreign capitalists, we think it advisable to be prepared in advance. We shall, therefore, be glad to know whether His Majesty's Government concur in the views above set forth, and to receive any instructions which it may be deemed advisable to issue for the guidance of our local officers in the event of renewed adventures of a more determined character. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON. KITCHENER. T. RALEIGH. E. E.-G. LAW. E. R. ELLES. A. 'T. ARUNDEL.

(0ctober 19&gt;) CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. No. 1. Foreign Office to the Law Offieo-s of the Crown. Foreign Office, October 19, 1904. Gentlemen, \, w 1 have the honour to transmit to you herewith, by direction of the JJ arc l ues s of Lansdowne, the papers noted in the accompanying list relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the ng its enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries. /a 11 W l 1 } ^ ob ® erv ° d from tlle Ill dia Office letter of the 30th June ( nnex A) that the Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty s Government to the fact that by the steps they have consistently taken or more than a century to maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, thev aye deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be substantiated atl0n t0 defend t]ll0se rights 11180 far ^ tlie ^ cai1 reasonably[ 8 ] They cite instances in the past in which they have successfully intervened to prevent the intrusion both of foreigners by diplomatic means aud of British subjects. They recognise, however, that the position is difficult, both in regard to British subjects and from the point of view of international law. They there fore desire to ascertain the extent to which they may be authorised to intervene, should the necessity arise. The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1. The pearl fishery banks lie oflf the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts (Annex B) enclosed with the Government of India's letter, from Um-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty's Government have identical Agreements (Annex 0) with the Arab Ciiiefs of llaz-ul-Kliaimah, Um-ul-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi, and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The territory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian Coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar Agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty's Government. North of Bahrein, the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty's Government. 2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to be found* and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in these waters. 4. {a) Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the 3-mile territorial limit. (li) Some of the banks extend from within the 3-mile limit outwards for several miles. (c) Some of the banks are entirely outside the 3-mile limit. In all those cases the? tribes have exercised an exclusive and concurrent right of fishing for pearls. 5. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the banks, having no appliances for deep-wnter fishing. It is apprehended that dredging for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks; and it is desired, if possible, to prevent dredging in such deep waters. 6. The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on (1) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly ; and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf in maintaining that monopoly. It is conceived that some precise' delegation of authority to the British Government to act on behalf of the tribes in this matter would be necessary. It must be added that none of the tribes have any judicial system or Courts of Law for dealing with trespassers or trespassing boats. ' A collection of confidential correspondence respecting the* Ceylon Pearl Fisheries, which took place in 1891-1892 (Annex D), and copies of the Argument (Annex E) and Counter-Case (Annex E) of Her late Majesty's Government in the Behring Sea Arbitration (certain passages in which are specially marked) are inclosed herewith for your information. I am to request that you wil- take the papers transmitted herewith into your consideration, and that you will favour Lord Lansdowne with your opinion :— 1. As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the 3-mile territorial limit: 2. As to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. I have, etc., (Sd.) ELDON GORST. G. I. # C. P. O.-J^o. 2748 F. D. -1-112.1901-40—P. M.

Your Excellency will see that the Law Officers of the Crown have no doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as may justly be considered territorial. Outside territorial waters, they are inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof; but they consider that the point is not free from doubt. In regard to the deeper waters, they are of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. 4. In these circumstances, I agree with the general conclusion at which the Law Officers of the Crown have arrived, viz., that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods. I have the honour to be, / My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Brodrick. S. 5.Enclosure No. 1. India Ofrioe to Foreign Office. ENCLOSURES. Sir, India Office, 30th June 1904;. I am directed hy Mr. Secretary Brodrick to forward, to be laid before the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of a letter from the Govern ment of India in the Secret Department, No. 63, dated 10th March 1904, on the subject of the policy to be pursued in order to prevent any interference by foreign enterprise with the rights enjoyed by the tribes under our protection in the pearl fisheries on tlie Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. The attention of the Government of India has agnin been called to the question by the proceedings of two Frenchmen who visited Bahrein in K!03. with the intention o!' prospecting the pearl fisheries round the island The Chief of Bahrain refused to entertain their proposals, but it is reported that they are taking steps to procure from Europe the- means of conducting fishing operations. No immediate action is necessary, but; having regard to the serious nature of the situation' which would arise if interlopers commenced fishing operations on pearl banks in respect of which the tribes would look to us to defend their monopoly, the Government of India request the opinion of His Majesty's Government on the policy to be pursued in the event of such a contingency arising. The question oi policy, as the Government of India indicate, is governed by that of the extent of the legal powers of intervention against foreign intrusion possessed by the British Government in virtue of their agreements with the tribes. The result of these agreements, under which the use of armed boats by the Ch efs is prohibited, has been to impose on us the responsibility for the maintenance of order in these waters, and the obligation to defend, so far as they can reasonably be substantiated, the rights of the tribes in the fisheries* A report by the Legal Adviser to this Office on the questions of law raised in the Government of India's Despatch is enclosed, and Mr. Brodrick would suggest that the matter should b^ submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown with a view to ascertain the extent to which the Government of India might be authorised to intervene against interlopers, whether foreigners or British subjects, should the necessity arise. There can be no question, in Mr. Brodrick's opinion, of tho - ~ extreme desirability of securing to the tribes in the future the monopoly which they have hitherto enjoyed. The material facts may be stated as follows : — 1. Tho pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Govern ment of India's Despatch, from Umm-ui-Kawain to near the head of the Gult. His Majesty's Government has agreements wiih the Arab Chiefs of Ras-al-Khaimah, Umm-al-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, D.-hai, Abu Drhabi and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs have practically sur.-endeied their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The question of making a similar agreement with the Sheikh of El Katr is now under the consideration of His Majesty's Government. North of * Bahrein the sovereignty over the western shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territories of the Sheikh of Koweit, whose special relations with His Majesty's Government are known to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.C7 2. Apparently nil the tribes fish for joearls wlierever they are to be found, and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Oniy members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in the waters. 4i.—(«) Portions ol' some of the pearl hanks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. (b) Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile territorial limit outwards for several miles. (c) Some of the pearl banks are entirely outside the three-mile territorial Jimit. Tn all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive right for fishing for pearls. 5. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off tlie banks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that divinsr for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks, and it is desired, if possible, to prevent * dredging in such deep waters. G. The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on (1) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly, and (2) the power-of the British Government to act on their behalf.. It is conceived that some precise delegation of authority to the British .Government to act on hehalf of the tribes in this matter would be necessary. 7. Ti;e Law Officers would probably advise as to 'the legal rights of the tribes within and also without the three-mile territorial limit, and as to the nature and extent of the delegation to be obtained, and further as to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Annex. Report by the Legal Adviser to the India Office, dated 12th April 1904. Two distinct questions are raised in the Despatch of the Government of India. 1. First, there is the question whether the British Government is in a position to assert and vindicate the rights possessed by the Chiefs over the waters which adjoin their territories. This, it seems to me, is a question of fact. If it is correct to say that the Chiefs have all agreed to leave the protection of their interests in the hands of the British Government, then the existence or non-existence of a treaty defining ' their relations or imposing on the Government the obligation of affording that protection does not seem to mo material. So long as an/ act done by officers of the Government can be proved to have been done under the authority of the Chiefs whose territory may be concerned, then those officers have, I think, a complete defence (see Carr v. Times, 1902, A.C. 176). Nor do I think that any foreign fetate could complain of such an act, provided of course that it was an act which, if done by the Chief himself, would not have transgr ssed the rules of International'law. 2. As regards the extent of the jurisdiction of a State beyond the limits of its own shores, I do not think I can do better than cite the opinion of the Law Officers of the Government of India in the case of- r the Mergui pearl fisheries, that jopinion having been approved by the r Law Officers of the Crown. They wrote as follows: ' We are of ' opinion that the British Government possesses territorial jurisdiction ' over the sea within a belt or zone of three miles from the shores of* the mainland of the provinces of Zeh, Tavoy, Mergui, and Tenasserira, &lt;c and of tlie islands appertaining thereto, including the Mergui u Archipelngo; as also over all bays, gulfs, and estuaries inter fauces 44 terrce, whether of such mainland or islands, but no further.' While adoptinir the opinion as correct, the Law Officers of the Crown add, with reference to the Australian and Ceylon fisheries : ' The Australian 44 Pearl Fishery Acts are limited in their operation to British subjects, il and we assume that, in the case of the peirl fisheries in the Mergui ' Archipelago, there lias not been, as in the case of the Ceylon fisheries, ' an immemorial claim to the pearl-oyster fishery beyond the usual ' territorial waters asserted by successive rulers and acquiesced in.' {See Revenue, Statistics, and Commerce Papers, 1893, December.) This opinion, it is to be observed, was given after the publication of the award in the B^hring Sea Arbitration, which took pla'je in August of the s une year. In that arbin ation a claim similar to that susr'jrcsted in i ■ o ' the sixth paragraph of the? Despatch was put forward on behalf of the United States ; it was met bv strong arguments on behalf of the British 7 • O O Government, {see Chapter V1IT. of British Case and Argument, p. 36), and was negatived by the award. With regard to the Ceylon precedent, which among others was relied on by the United States in support of their claim to a right of some sort extending beyond the three-mile limit, it is pointed out in the argument that tiiese fisheries ' have been 44 treated from time immemorial by the successive rulers of the Island 44 as subjects of property and jurisdiction, and have been so regarded 44 with the acquiescence of all other nations.' The Ceylon case thus stated is. in fact, one which illustr.ites the proposition that a portion of the high sea may be appropriated by dint of actual occupation in the same way as land may be so occupied. If a similar assertion of owner ship and acquiescence could be proved with regard to the fisheries in the Persian Gulf outside the three-mile limit, I think those fisheries would be taken to be included within the territory of the State to which they are contiguous. Otherwise, the three-mile limit must prevail, for that is the rule which a State is supposed to adopt in the absence of express notice that a larger extent; is claimed (see Hall on International Law, p. 154). In order to apply the above principles to the cise of any particular fishing ground (for I presume there are distinct fishing grounds), it may be necessary to institute a more detailed inquiry than has already been made, so that it may be decided whether in that particular case it is expedient to assert a claim by right of occupation larger than that which the ordinary rule would justify.

I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. G odley. Eoreign Office. Annex. • • • • Pearl Eisheries in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum. The Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty's Government in the annexed letter to the fact that by the steps they have consistently taken for more than a century to maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the coast of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be under an obligation to defend those rights in so far as they can reasonably be substantiated. They cite instances in the past in which they have have successfully intervened to prevent the intrusion both of foreigners, by diplomatic means, and of British subjects. They recognise, however, that the position is difficult, both in regard to British subjects and from the point of view of international law. They therefore desire to ascertain the extent to which they may be authorised to intervene, should the necessity arise.4 The material fa'jts may he stated as follows :— 1. The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and otl' the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts enclosed with the Government of India's letter, from Um-ul- Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty's Government has identical agreements Avitli the Arab Chiefs of Ras -ul -Khaimah, Uin-ul- Kawain, Ajman, Sliargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi and Balirein, by which the Chiefs have praclically surrendered their foreign relations into the hanils of the British Government. The territory of these Cliiefs comprises the Arabian const of the Gulf off which the pearl bunks lie up to the island of Bahrein, w f ith the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now r under the consideration of His Majesty's Government. North of Bahrein the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gnlf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty's Government. 2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to be found ; and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in these waters. 4. [a) Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. {b) Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile limit outwards for several miles. (&lt;?) Some of the banks are entirely outside the three-mile limit. In all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive and concurrent right of fishing for pearls. o. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters off the banks, having no appliances for deep water fishing.

Foreign Office, Gentlemen, igth October 1904. I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, by direction of the Marquess of Lansdowne, the papers noted in the accompanying list, relative to the question of the steps to be taken to pr vent foreign inter fere nee Avitli the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast oi' the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries. ^ It will be observed, from the India Office letter of the 30th June (Annex AV that the Government of India have called the attention of His Majesty's Government to the fact that, by the steps they have con sistently taken for mo«e than a century t &gt; maintain the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf, they have deprived the Arab Chiefs on the eoa5;t of the means of forcibly protecting their interests in the pearl fisheries, and that they therefore feel themselves to be under an obli&lt;ration to def.'iid those li-hts in so fnr as they can reasonably be substantiated. J hey cite instances in the past in which they have successfully intervened to prevent the intrusion both of foreigners, by diplomatic means, and of British subjects. They recognise, however, that the position is difficult, both in regard to British subjects and from the point of view of international law. They, therefore, desire to ascertain the extent to which they may be authorised to intervene, should the necessity arise. The material facts may be stated as follows :— 1. The pearl fishery banks lie off the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, and off the coast of Bahrein. They extend, as shown on the charts (Annex B), inclosed with the Government of India's letter, from Um-ul-Kawain to near the head of the Gulf. His Majesty's Govern ment have identical agreements (Annex C) with the Arab Chiefs of Eas-ul-Khaimah. Um-ul-Kawain, Ajman, Shargah, Debai, Abu Dthabi, and Bahrein, by which the Chiefs.have practically surrendered their foreign relations into the hands of the British Government. The terri tory of these Chiefs comprises the Arabian coast of the Gulf off which the pearl banks lie up to the island of Bahrein, with the exception of the promontory of El Katr, with whose Chief the question of making a similar agreement is now under the consideration of His Majesty's Government. North of Bahrein, the sovereignty over the Arabian shore of the Gulf belongs to the Sultan of Turkey, with the exception of the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, who has special relations with His Majesty's Government. 2. Apparently all the tribes fish for pearls wherever they are to be found, and no tribe has exercised a right excluding the other tribes from any part of the fishery. 3. Only members of the tribes have hitherto fished for pearls in these waters. Portions of some of the pearl banks lie within the three-mile territorial limit. Some of the banks extend from within the three-mile limit outwards for several miles. (c) Some of the banks are entirely outside the three-mile limit. In all these cases the tribes have exercised an exclusive and concurrent right of fishing for pearls. 5. The tribes have not fished for pearls in the deep waters o(f the banks, having no appliances for deep water fishing. It is apprehended that dredging for pearls in such deep waters would materially injure the pearl fishery on the banks ; and it is desired, if possible, to prevent, dredging in such deep waters. 6. The action to be taken for the protection of the pearl fishery would appear to depend on (1) the legal right of the tribes to a monopoly; 1 /A / ( V and (2) the power of the British Government to act on their behalf in maintaining that monopoly. It is conceived that some precise delega tion of authority to the British Government to act on behalf oL ? the tribes in Ibis matter would he necessary. It must be added that none of the tribes have any judicial system or courts of law for dealing with trespassers or trespassing boats.

I am to request that you will take the papers transmitted herewith into your consideration, and that you will favour Lord Lansdowne with your opinion— (1) As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the three-mile territorial limit.

We were honoured with your Lordship's commands, signified in Sir Eldon Gorst's letter of the 19th October last, transmitting to us the accompanying papers, relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign interference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries, and requesting us to favour your Lordship with our opinion— (1) As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the the three-mile territorial limit. (2) As to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers, and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. - e have taken the matter into our consideration, and, in obedience to your Lordship's commands, have the honour to report— (1) That the tribes have a right to the exclusive use of the pearl fisheries within the three-mile limit, and in any other waters which may justly be considered territorial.. S. 5. c &lt;® iAs regards the fisheries beyond lerritcmal waters, we tliink tliat a distinction must be drawn between the hanks where the tribes have practised pearl fishing and the deep zcate?'s in which no such fishery has been carrisd on by them. As regards the pearl banks, we think that, as a matter of inter national law, they are capable of being the property ol tiie tribes to the exclusion of all nations. In addition to the passage cited trom Vattel, reference may be made to Puffendorfs Treatise ' de jure Naturae efc gentium,' Book IV., Chapter V., Section 7, and to the recent work of Professer Westlake, 'International Law,' Part 1., chapter 1), at pages 186 and 187, and the case of the pro lectio a of the Ceylon pearl banks is a striking illustration of the assertion of this right iti practice. Whether sueh rights, in (act, exist with regard to these particular pearl banks in the Persian Gulf is a question the answer to which cannot be c^iven with any certainty, as it depends on the evidence available of historical facts with reference to the enjoyment of these fisheries hy the tribes and the exelusion ol' others from them. As far as we can judge, upon the materials before us, we think that there are grounds lor asserting the existence of such an exclusive right, and we do not think that, in point of law, the fact that the enjoyment was by the tribes in common would prevent the acquisition of the right in question. Having regard to the relations of His Majesty's Government with the tribes on the west shore of the Persian Gulf, we think that the existence of this exclusive right may be properly maintained on their behalf by His Majesty's Government With regard to the deep waters in which pearl fishing lias not been carried on by the tribes we think the case is different. There is here no defined area*at the bottom of the sea over which the right of fishing has been exercised to the exclusion of other nations, as there is some ground for saying was the case with regard to the pearl banks. We cannot see thai the right claimed by the tribes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success. (2) Having regard to the importance of protecting the deeper waters and to the fact that for the reasons above indicated it cannot be regarded as certain that the right, even to the pearl banks, could be established to the satisfaction of any international tribunal, we think that it would be preferable to discourage foreign interference by refusing supplies, &amp;c., as suggested in the papers before us. If such measures prove inadequate it may be necessary, having obtained the authority of the Chiefs for this purpose, to compel the removal of vessels engaged in fishing on the pearl banks. Of course, measures of this kind must be taken with caution, as international complications might result irom any precipitate action. It might also be practicable—whether it should be done or not is a matter of policy—to raise the question in a form suitable for decision by the Hague Tribunal. Fishing within the territorial waters may, of course, be prevented. Generally. We desire to add that, having regard to the importance of the question to the tribes, and the fact that we cannot be certain of establishing the right claimed, it is probably desirable that the fishing by foreigners should, if possible, be indirectly stopped without raising the question internationally.

I handed on Dr. Gustav Lovien's letter enclosed in your communication of April 11th to the Eastern Department to be dealt with as the matter with which it deals - n.amely the pearl industry in the Persian Gulf and particularly at Bahrein - is roally more political than commercial, and I now send you the answers which, after consultation with the India Office, they propose that you should return to his questions. (sd) A. Law. P roposed Replies. 1. The rights of fishing for pearls in the Persian Gulf have been held in common from time immemorial by the Arab Chiefs upon its eastern shores, who are under Treaty obliga tions to the British Government. And no Chief has the right to grant a concession to fish to outside parties. But there is no restriction upon the sale of pearls. The British Government has close treaty relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and other Chiefs and conducts their relations with foreign Powers. The Natives do the fishing and sell to pearl merchants at Bahrein, ivoweit etc. 3. J3. The British Govenuiient is roprasented at Bahrein by a Political Agent, who is in close communication with the Sheikh, and is associated with him in trying certain cases. There is also a me.1 lies or local Committee, meeting ordin arily at the Agency, to endeavour in the first instance to effect a settlement of commercial disputes. 4. So far as I am aware, the local Government does not publish statistics, but you will find figures in the Consular report (Od. 3727-^44) published by Messrs V/yman and Sons, Li^ito*, Futt^r L^ne, London# i.G-No. 3223, dated Bushire, the 4th (received 13th) December 1910 (Confidential). From—L ieutenant -C olonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.L, C .I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite reference to the Bahrain Trade Report for 1909-1910 in which, when on the subject of the pearl trade, Captain Mackenzie refers to Mr. Rosenthal's apparently successful enterprise in pearl-buying on the spot and regrets that no British Firm has entered the lists. 2. I first thought of addressing the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade in the latter connection, but in view of the past record on this subject, it would seem better for any suggestion in the direction above mentioned to go through the Government of India. 3. I cannot say I altogether welcome the advent of these European experts in the local market as the development is one which will not only tend in itself to disturb the time-honoured usages of the industry, but the Europeans who come and find they can buy successfully will inevitably be tempted by the experience gained, to make a further advance and own their own boats, or will attempt to get concessions, and become a source of difficulty to us; but as it is presumably impossible to prevent the Agents of Foreign Firms from summering in the Gulf in order to buy pearls on the spot, it would seem important for us to find some well-qualified British Firms prepared to enter into competition with them. 4. But pearling is a highly specialised branch of Commerce for which the possession of really expert knowledge, plenty of capital, courage and a free hand is essential, and these qualifications none of our old-established trading firms in the Gulf sufficiently possess. I therefore suggest that it would be well if the Board of Trade could be authorised to sound such Firms as Messrs. Streeter of Bond Street (who have before taken an interest in the local trade) with a view to their entering the lists. / In doing so, however, I would respectfully recall the Government of India's despatch No. 62 (Secret-External), dated 2nd June 1890, to His Majesty's Secretary of State, and connected correspondence. S. G. P. L—1977 P. D.—19-12.10—44.{Confidential.) No. 32*28, dated Bushire, the 4th (received 13th) December 1910. From— L ieutenant- C olonel P. Z. Cox, C.S .I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the consideration of the Government of India, a copv of an interesting communi- No. 763, dated 12th November 1910. cation addressed to me by the Political Agent at Bahrain in which he reports the existence among the pearl fishing talent at Bahrain of the conviction that the banks fished from that centre are becoming depleted, and goes on to make certain suggestions in connection therewith. 2. It will be seen that the Nakhodas attribute the depletion to the inception and growth of the trade in oyster shells, whereby the banks are deprived of the fertilising influence of the empty shells which in former days used to be returned to the deep after examination for pearls. It is by this trade in pearl-oyster shells, as I think the Government of India are aware, that Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. have been enabled to gain such a firm footing in the Gulf. 3. It would seem premature to enter into any lively discussion of the measures necessary to discourage the shell-trade or otherwise cope with the reported depletion, until expert opinion has been obtained as to whether it is due to the loss to the banks of the fertilising properties of the dead shells, or to other causes; and I feel sure that the Government of India will agree with Captain Mackenzie and myself as to the vital importance of probing the causes of the depletion and taking effective steps, if such are possible, to remedy it. j. No. 763, dated Bahrain, the 12th November 1910 (Confidential). ^ From— Captain,C. F. Mackenzie, I. A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—C olonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that such of the Nakhodas of Bahrain as are interested in pearling are very much disappointed at the number of oyster shells they are finding, and they alse complain that on the whole such shells as are found appear to be of thinner quality than formerly, which in their opinion is due to the oysters not being fully developed and consequently there is less likelihood of obtaining pearls. They attribute this diminution to the practice of bringing away a large quantity of shells from the banks for sale in Bahrain, instead of the shells being thrown back into the sea as formerly. 2. I had previously heard the opinion expressed by them that the throwing back-of the old shells assisted the fertility of the beds, but had not considered the '-m^t itpiv seriously until recently when this view has been persistently presented to me by some of the leading Nakhodas. Originally I held it was just as herring or other fisheries are good in one year, and the next year bad. The Nakhodas state that the amount of shells brought up by the divers this year represents only 40 per cent, of the number eight years ago and that they have noticed a diminution the whole time but more especially in the last two years. This estimate of 40 per cent, is the highest given. Others estimate it at 25 per cent, but allowing for all exaggeration perhaps we may place it at 50 per cent. The nearest estimate to the number of pearling vessels is for— The year 1900 860 1905 917 „ 1910 970 1978 F. D.Irrespective of numbers, the increase is about 12 per cent, which is the basis on which we may work, and although I have been unable to obtain figures it would appear that the increase of mainland vessels is approximately the same, h • The figures for the last ten years for exportation of pearls and shells are annexed. Enclosures A and B. It is possible that the large exports of shells of seasons 1903 and 1904 may have started the damage, and those of 1908 and 1909 seem to have rendered matters worse as the complaints specially refer to the last two years or seasons 1909 and 1910. The figures for pearl exports are deceiving and depend so very much on the value of pearls and the amounts remaining from one year to another, that I hardly think they can be taken to show the number of pearls found, and even if they did, they cannot be held to determine the number of oysters. As the percentage of pearls found to oysters fished up varies and as the pearl is generally supposed to be created by the oyster to alleviate some parasitic growth, it follows that the disease is more prevalent in some years than in others and therefore a proportionately larger number of pearls are found. I have been unable to obtain figures for the weights of actual pearls fished up during the past ten years, which would undoubtedly be the best even if erroneous method of coming to a conclusion as to whether the alleged decrease of oysters is an actual fact, and if so, to what extent. It will be impossible to get figures except for a few vessels as none of the people I have yet enquired from have kept accounts of these. It is moreover a matter which requires delicate treatment, as the first idea of ignorant j)eople would be that I am collecting statistics to see if it were worth while for a European Company to exploit the banks. The figures for a few vessels will be of little value, and will possibly be misleading. I have not further delayed this letter to obtain them. Such as are obtain- able will be forwarded shortly. There is no doubt that the. present season has been extremely bad in respect to the number of pearls found. 3. The question to be solved is whether the decrease in shells is due to natural causes ; to pearling operations now extending beyond the recuperative powers of the banks ; or due to the depletion of banks by sale of oyster shells exported. As the matter is one of vital importance to the welfare of Bahrain and the whole of Arab Coast, I am of opinion that the cause attributed by the Arabs should be carefully considered by experts, and no doubt the experience gained on the Ceylon banks and other pearling localities will offer valuable assistance in determining the issue. 4. I would point out— (a) The Oman divers have the last two years considerably reduced the sale of shells and practically none have been brought in from Katar this year and they are throwing the shells back into the sea. (£) Many of the bigger Nakhodas do not permit their shells to be sold, and insist on their being returned to the sea, thus foregoing profits for the future benefit of the banks. Before the improvi dent Arab who has little thought for the future would do this, he must hold fairly strong opinions on the subject. i j There is however another reason for this, viz., that they consider the busi ness of looking for pearls is likely to be scamped, if the men have the secondary employment of cutting out the oyster and preparing shells for sale. They also consider it unhealthy to keep the shells longer than necessary.5. Oyster shells when picked up not only have other small oyster shells attached to them, but appear to be the hosts of many other molluscs and parasites of different sorts. The larvae after release from the parent oyster are free to move where they like. Later on they stick to the bottom either close to the place of origin but on occasions at a considerable distance therefrom. They then fix themselves to shells, stones or other objects and assume the form of an oyster. They are that time only about 2 J oth of an inch in diameter and it is more than possible that large numbers of these adhere to the shells, and were the shells returned to the water it seems probable that many of the minute oysters would survive the few hours which they remain in the pearling boat. In certain artificial beds the method is simply to distribute oyster shells over the ground, just before the spawning season, so as to afford domiciles to the young oysters. I say few hours, as there is no fixed procedure for examining the oysters for pearls. This depends on the quantity of shells found on any particular day, the state of the weather, the idiosyncrasies of the various Kakhodas, etc. Generally speaking, there are two examinations: one in the evening and the other in the morning. 6. Oyster beds have been destroyed by over-fishing, by natural causes, probably disease as their enemies are few, and rarely by migration. In such instances it has frequently taken many years for the bank to recover itself. Locally it has long been known that certain banks which yield abundantly one year may have very few oysters the next or even for several years in suc cession. It is therefore clear that the cause now attributed is'not the sole reason for diminution. 7. At present natural causes for diminution are beyond our power of prevent increase of pearling vessels. There only Xiveu uu me assumption that the theory adduced by the Nathodas for the deficit is incorrect it would not be wise to take any risks in the matter as the shell trade is only a by-product of the pearl trade, and even in exceptional years it only amounts to about 4 per cent, the value of the latter. The fishers are Arabs and I am confident that a large number of the middle class Nakhodas will follow the bigger ones to make some combined effort for the coming season. Owing to lack of organization, the measures without our co-operation and guidance are likely to be only partially successful and a step of this nature is practically useless unless complete measures are taken. It is moreover necessary to contemplate the fact that the measures might have to proceed for five or ten years or even indefinitely. There is no doubt that our assistance in closing the shell trade would be warmly appreciated by the Arabs, who would then be convinced that we would sooner lose the trade in shells than see their pearl trade damaged. 8. 'vjpurernment will desire to be fully convinced of the necessity before taking action to assist stopping the trade, and I regret I have not sufficient data to afford such proofs. It may be considered that for the following season it is sufficient to allow the Nakhodas to make their own preventive measures. In this case it will only be necessary to watch the results of the next pearl season. If they are favourable, no further action appears necessary; if unfavourable, complete measures can be taken for the season of 1912, and in the meantime the steps to be taken can be fully considered. Should Government wish to take fuller measures for the season of 1911, the only thing that is necessary in respect to Bahrain is for Sheikh Isa to proclaim tha^ no shells will be allowed to be imported, or sold in Bahrain, and merchants making advances for shells will do so at their own risk.r - . 4 Such proclamation should issue by the New Year, when advances for shells will commence, Or as soon after as is convenient. Each Sheikh may order his own subjects not to sell shells at sea. To obtain complete organization it would be preferable to take steps at Lingah as weU as with the respective Chiefs, who I think will all willing co-operate. 0 Sheikh Isa is not likely to care for the disruption of the shell trade as he gets tour annas per bag export duty. 'With due explanation as to possibility or damage to pearl banks I feel sure he would readily assist. , r 9 - T lf T mo fJ serious loss ensuing on the stoppage of this trade will fall on Messrs. v\ onckhaus &amp; Co., who would not be able to run their business in Bahrain at a profit without the assistance of shells. % . Messrs, Gray, Paul &amp; Co. would be the next heavy losers, but their interests m Bahrain are more varied. • -^ ss u ould fall on the individual Arab and Persian merchants who ship shells. One Hanniah firm occasionally also ships. A certain amount of freight would be lost by the British India Steam Navigation Company, while the Hamburg America Line would probably discontinue the occasional calls they make at Bahrain on the homeward vovao-e It would also mean that intentions of any direct Home Line of Britfsh Steamers to call at Bahrain would probably fall through though not necessarily. ^ 0 Taking the profits at 30 per cent., which is doubtful now that competition lias increased so largely, we only get a loss of £8,000 in the biggest export year, while if in future years the export falls to half as I anticipate, we only obtain a loss of £4,000 which in accordance with present proportion of trade would be distributed approximately as follows £ Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. Miscellaneous Total 1,100 1,100 1,800 4,000 \ Moreover as year by year the competition increases, the profits from this source decrease. Other losses will be to the Nakhodas, who get now about Rs. 2 per cwt It is thus seen that the losses are very trifling in comparison with the ■ staxe at issue. 10. The possibility of decrease in the output of the natural pearl banks would seem to point to the advisability of considering whether under anv conditions it would be possible or political to form a Company for fertilizing and maintaining artificial beds within the territorial waters of Bahrain. &amp; Although waters so near land would not contain such promising localities as other positions yet they appear to be less open to general objectioner:— „ , ^ kereas there is no reasonable chance of asserting with success the ri^ht or the i nbes to debar other nations from dredging deep waters (vidp I p Hpt No. 8 dated 31st March 1905, from the India Office to His Excelled Right Hon ble the Governor-General of India in Council), there would assumabJy be the same difficulties in preventing artificial fertilization of likelv spots over which the Tribes cannot maintain their right to exclusive possession The object in view, viz., prevention, might or might not be attainable bv indirect methods. * The poiicy of Government is, I believe, to maintain the rights of the Arabs. 1 hese rights could be upheld in the present proposal either bv the employment of Arab capital, or the work might be carried out bv means of a loan direct to Sheikh Isa. Should such fertilization within territorial waters prove a financial success, the operations could be extended.to deeper waters ro * ^ 4&gt;■' No. 8 op 1911. GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.

But as we are not in a position to prevent the agents of European firms from buying pearls in the local market, it seems regrettable that some British firm, possessing the necessary qualifications, should not enter the lists and share in the profits, which, as will be seen from the Trade Report of the Bahrain Islands for 1909-10, are large.

Theaim of this special nmchinery is:-Firstly to greatly increase the prodoctios and efficiency of each boat, and secondly, to replace man-power by motor power, thus reducing operating ex- pensesto a mere trifle. This machine plant can be supplied in three different forms, viz:- Motor with air compressor alone. Motor with air rcompressor and reversible 'WOLVERIEE' Propeller Motor with air compressor andsolid propeller driven tnrji our 'WOLVERIIJE' Reversing Clutch. The prices of these different outfits are shown enclosed Bull.#24, page 3, and they are strictly net, the Proposed motor is of 5 EHP but larger power can, of course. Toe supplied if required. The great advantages of this special outfit will be at once apparent to you,aiid they have, in fact, been demonstrated and fully recognised by the shell fishing concerns on the various pearling grounds. The motor can be successfully operated on either benzine or paraffin, with a very low fuel consumption. The whole plant being exceedingly simple in design, it can be handled by ordinary fisher men, without the assiatance of competent engineers. We shall be very glad to have you consider this matter thor oughly, and if interested, please let us know, and we will with pleasure give you any additional data you may wish. Deliveries can usually be made in libout two weeks from receipt of order. Thanking you for your interest, and awaiting the favor of your reply,, we are, dear sirs.

The boat is away out on the pearling grounds at present at work, and may not be in Broome for some months. It will interest you to know that the boat in which your 14 H.P. engine is installed capsized in a hurricane last month. We were fortunate enough to be able to salvage the boat. You will be pleased to hear that though the engine was under water for a week, beyond having to clean it up and recharge the batteries, it was uninjured, and is running splendidly since the accident. 23 ft. by 6 ft.

Gentlemen: Enclosed is a snap shot of our launch 'Kitty Watts,' 45 ft. by 9 ft. 6 in., riding at mooring at Quoin Island. Am sorry that I have none better at hand, but if this is not suitable will get a snapshot of the launch 'under weigh.' This is a very bad time to take any photographs, as the monsoons are now on. As regards the work the boat is doing, would say that she is out every week to Mergui and back. The r ound trip is 1 00 miles, and in 'fair_weather she does the .trip frorfTthe Island to Mergui f50 miles) in five hours. During the present monsoons she has taken as much as 5 days to do the same trip, owing to having to put up, not on account of breakdowns, but bad weather and high seas. Last year during the pearling season, the boat had to go to the pearling grounds about once in two weeks, the round trip being 140 miles. The boat has done about 8,500 miles, roughly, up to date, and the motor is as sound and works as well if not better than when first installed. The engine uses kerosene (paraffin) for fuel. I am not a motor engine expert, but I am a mechanical and electrical engineer ; and from my experience in the mechanical line, 1 say, 'Give me a 'Wolverine' motor engine which works like a clock and as regular.' I cannot say enough in praise of the motor engine in our launch, except that it is a credit to the makers both as to its simplicity in understanding its workings as well as to its reliability and precision in action.

Themes covered include: Britain’s duty to protect the pearl banks for the benefit of the Arab pearl divers, acknowledgement of growing national and international interest in the pearl banks, the extent of territorial waters, and the likely result of any legal challenges to Britain’s refusal to allow foreign interests the opportunity to exploit the Gulf’s pearl banks.2) Correspondence relating to an enquiry by a German businessman, concerning the pearl trade in the Gulf (folios 15-17).3) Printed copies of correspondence (folios 20-23) from the Persian Gulf Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Cox) and the Bahrain Political Agent (Captain Charles Mackenzie), dated 1910, concerning the increasing trade in oyster shells in the Gulf, used for the production of mother of pearl. A drop in the numbers of oysters being fished is attributed to the mother of pearl industry. A German firm based in Bahrain, Wonckhaus &amp; Co., is identified as a key exporter of oyster shells at Bahrain.4) A letter (folio 27) intercepted by the Political Agency in Bahrain, from the Secretary of the Wolverine Motor Works, U.S.A., to Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., dated 3 February 1915.
