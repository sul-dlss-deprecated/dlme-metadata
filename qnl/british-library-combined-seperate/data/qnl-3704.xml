Two additional foliation sequences are also present in parallel betweem ff 6-231 and ff 232-238 respectively; these numbers are written in a combination of pencil and crayon, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains correspondence relating to the drafting and implementation of Civil Aviation Agreements and Air Navigation Regulations between the British Government and Sheikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait (frequently referred to as Koweit), all of which came into effect in 1934. The principal correspondents in the file are Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent at Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, and representatives of the Air Ministry and India Office.There are multiple copies of the regulations contained in the volume, including: blank drafts drawn up by Government officials in 1933 (ff 11-16); one of the four original copies of the air agreement signed by the Ruler of Bahrain, Sheikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, dated 6 June 1934 (ff 161-176); and printed copies of the 1934 Civil Air Agreements and Air Navigation Regulations for Bahrain and Kuwait (ff 185-187, 189-191, 193-194, 196-197). Correspondence related to the agreements deal with matters including: exemption of duty payable on aircraft fuel imported into Bahrain; priority given to military aircraft in using civilian aerodromes; authorisation requests (subsequent to the publication of the agreements) for aircraft belonging to Imperial Airways Limited, Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Qantas, to use aerodrome facilities at Bahrain.The volume also contains two newspaper cuttings: one from

                           The Evening Standard(UK), dated 28 March 1934, celebrating ten years of Imperial Airways (f 139).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Air services agreements</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000332#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000332#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000332#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000332#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000332#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
