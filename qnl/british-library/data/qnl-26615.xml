The map indicates settlements, hydrology, and boundaries and provides some indication of relief. The map features additional lines marked in coloured ink, crayon, and pencil, which represent possible boundary lines for eastern and south-eastern Saudi Arabia.Two joined lines in blue and violet ink represent boundaries established in the Anglo-Ottoman Conventions of 1913 and 1914. Lines in green and brown crayon represent boundary lines proposed by the British to Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd]. A line in red crayon marks Ibn Saud's reported interpretation of his country's eastern and south-eastern boundary, and lines in pencil show other prospective boundaries considered by the British Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Rubaʻ-al-Khali</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049623112.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
