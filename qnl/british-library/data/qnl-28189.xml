Sir, I am directed to inform you that His Majesty the King Emperor has decided to institute a medal, which is to be known as the King’s Silver Jubilee Medal, to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of His Majestv’s accession to the Throne. The medal, which will be in silver, will bear on the obverse portraits of the King and Queen, and on the reverse the Roval Cypher with the Imperial Crown and the dates of His Majesty’s accession and Silver Jubilee. It will be worn on a ribbon of red and blue, with two white stripes in the same way as a coronation or military medal. 657(C) F&amp;PD2 * A/ 2. The medal will be distributed as a personal souvenir from His Majesty to selected recipients, who for the most part, will be members of the Crown Services in England and persons holding similar positions throughout the Empire. The main criterion will be distinguished public service during His Majesty’s reign and not, as was the rule in the case of some other commemo rative medals, presence at, or participation in, a particular ceremony, t he medal will therefore mostly be awarded to persons in the service of Govern ment, or to persons who have actively assisted in the conduct of the adminis tration. It will also be awarded to persons who, though they have not directly participated in the work of Government, are suitable representatives of their profession or calling and have attained distinction in the exercise of it; and to persons notable for their charitable and philanthropic w T ork. 3. Special consideration has been given to the position of ladies. It is His Majesty’s express desire that the medal should be awarded to ladies both on account of their own public service and, in a limited number of suitable cases, on account of the services of their husbands. The ribbon for the medal when awarded to ladies will be issued in the form of a bow. When ladies have alread}^ received medals worn on a bar, it will be permissible for them at their own option to wear the Jubilee Medal on the medal bar. 4. 30,000 medals are to be distributed in India, including distribution to all armed forces of the Crown serving in India. The distribution of the Coronation Durbar Medal of 1911 was about 26,000. 5. His Excellency the Viceroy desires that the following principles also should be observed in the distribution of the medal:— (1) No medal is to be given under any circumstances to any person in a menial position. (2) The medal should only be given to ladies whose position or public services are of the highest order. No medal should be given to any lady without the Viceroy’s express sanction. (3) No medal is to be given to any person whose loyalty is not unimpeachable. (4) The medal should be given to officials distinguished by their responsible position and good work, and to non-officials dis tinguished by their loyalty, influence, public spirit or philanthropy. (5) A nominal roll should be maintained of all persons to whom medals are given ; and care should be taken that the actual presentation is made in each case in a proper and formal manner. (6) The attention of Local Governments will be invited to the desir ability of considering the claims of members of the Central Legislatures from their provinces and of members of their own Legislative Councils, to receive the medal as eminent citizens or public workers. (7) It is assumed that Local Governments and Political Officers will not overlook members of Central Departments who happen to be serving in their provinces, or under their control. 6. The Viceroy desires that a number of medals should be distributed to Rulers of Indian States and to their nobles and officials. It is proposed therefore that it should be given to all the Rulers in your Agency including minors, with the exception of those Rulers who owing to their own short comings are not carrying on the administration of their St Tes. It is realised that in some agencies distribution to rulers should not be made below a certain level, and that having regard to the scale of distribution, certain petty chiefs, especially Shareholder Chiefs of Estates in Western India and the Gujarat States, should be excluded. It is left to the Political Officers con cerned to decide where the line should be drawn. Distribution to the nobles and officials of Indian States will be made on the following lines. An allot ment will be fixed for each State, and the Ruler will be informed of the principles on which the medal is being distributed and asked to say to whomhe would desire that the medal should be given in his State. The Political Officer should obtain from each Ruler a nominal roll of such persons, and will no doubt be able to obtain a revision of the list in cases where obviously unsuitable names are suggested. The number of medals allotted to the State will then be sent to the Ruler, who should be asked to present them in a formal manner, if possible during the Jubilee Celebrations in his State. The medals for each Ruler will be sent by the Political Officer concerned to him separately. They should be sent under cover of a demi-official letter and not with a kharita. The medals for Their Highnesses the Maharajas of Bikaner, Patiala and Kashmir will be sent by His Excellency the Commander-In-Chief to them as A.-D.-Cs. to His Majesty. 7. The distribution of the medal to ladies will be on a very small scale. In England the principles of distribution to ladies will be interpreted to include the wives of Cabinet Ministers, and probably the wives of Junior Ministers and wives and widows of e#-Cabinet Ministers who have held office during the King’s feign. The Viceroy desires that the medal should be given to present or past Maharanis Regent and to Maharanis who are holders of the Crown of India. These medals should be sent with a letter from the Political Officer to the Ruler or the Maharani concerned, as may be the usual custom. It is not intended that the medal should be given to other Maharanis, Ranis or Begums by virtue of their position. Moreover, distribution to ladies by virtue of their position will not be made to ladies whose husbands rank below Article 9 in the Warrant of Precedence, and therefore your recommendations will be confined to the few cases of ladies whose philanthropic or other services are of an outstanding nature. 8. In an appendix to this letter is shown the allotments proposed for the States. They are prepared on the basis of gun salutes and will therefore for this purpose contain anomalies. For instance the size and importance of certain non-salute States may be held to entitle them to receive more than the one medal allotted to them; and distribution on the provisional scale to small States with a large gun-Salute may be excessive. It is therefore left to Political Officers to vary the allotments in their Agencies as they think suitable. It is not essential that all the medals should be distributed, a'nd if you consider that distribution on the scale proposed in your Agency would be excessive, you should surrender a portion of your allotment. You may ask for a small supplementary allotment if it is really essential, but the num ber available to meet such requests is likely to be very small and it may be impossible to meet them except from the number surrendered by Political Officers. In the case of minority administrations, the Political Officer responsible for the State administration should supervise the preparation of the distribu tion list for the State. The cases of States the Rulers of which, on account of their own shortcomings, are not carrying on the administration and will not be given the medal, may be more difficult. It is however not possible to lay down any rule for the treatment of these cases, and it is left to Politi cal Officers to decide whether to distribute in such States all or a proportion of the allotment for nobles and officials. 9. Distribution to Armed Forces in India will probably be made on a 2 per cent, basis, with automatic grants to certain senior officers. The cri terion for distribution will be length of service. It is provisionally proposed to make a distribution on a similar basis to Indian States Forces and Irregu lar Corps. In the case of Indian States Forces an allotment will be made for each State, and a suggested scheme of distribution will be sent for communica tion to Rulers. It will be left to the Rulers to apply the scheme to their own State Forces and to decide the actual distribution. Further details regarding the scheme of distribution to Regular Armed Forces will be communicated to you as early as possible, in order that your scheme for distribution to Irregular Forces under your control may as far as possible conform to that scheme.4 10. Distribution to Agency Police Forces has been calculated on a 2 per cent, basis, and in the appendix to this letter, allotment for the Police Forces under your control has been shown accordingly. 11. It is proposed to distribute the medal to all members of the Political Department who are holding or have held superior appointments or are hold ing responsible posts on foreign service. In the appendix to this letter is a list of the posts held by members of the Department in your agency who w ill be granted the medal. It is also proposed to grant the medal to all Agency Surgeons and Officers of the Indian Medical Service of the Foreign and Political cadre on deputation and to Police officers and other officials serving in Agencies whose status corresponds to that of a District Officer (Deputy Commissioner, Executive Engineer, etc.) in a Province in British India. 12. In the appendix to this letter there is also shown the miscellaneous allotment proposed for the agencies and administered areas. This allotment is meant to cover all officers serving in agencies (excluding officers of the Political Department and Indian Medical Service who are shown separ ately) all executive and ministerial staff serving under your control and non-officials residing in British Administered Areas, including Cantonments. 13. The Government of India will be responsible for distribution of the medal to all officers of the Political Department and other Central Departments serving under your control, who will be on long leave on the date of the Jubilee. If there are any officers not in these categories or whose leave is sanctioned by you without reference to the Government of India, who are on leave at that date and to whom you will be unable to give the medal then, you are requested to send a list with their addresses on leave as early as possible. 14. In the distribution of medals in States and Agencies, the following points should be observed :— (1) No medal should be given without the sanction of the Government of India to a serving Military Officer seconded for duty in a State or on duty in an Agency who will in the normal course of events return to regular military employ. Such medals will come from the Army Department quota. In certain cases, medals for such officers will not be given by the military autho rities under their scheme of distribution ; but there may be local reasons for making exceptions, and you are asked to make your recommendations in every case in which you consider that a medal should be given. (2) No medal should be given to an officer of a Provincial Government serving in a State or in an Agency without the approval of that Government. (3) No medal should be given to non-officials in Cantonments without the prior concurrence of the local military authorities. (4) The ministerial staffs of your own and associated offices are small and a percentage limit is not proposed. It may be noted how ever that the distribution for ministerial staffs in England is on a | per cent, basis. As a general rule it is not advisable to give more than on the following maximum scale — First class Resident’s offices including associated offices (Police, P. W. D. etc.) .... 3 Second class Residents’ offices . . . * 1 i Political Agents’ offices . . . . . , ) 1 (5) It is suggested that you should consult Political officers of neigh bouring agencies in all cases where you consider it advisable. The instructions of the Government of India cannot be so detailed as to ensure complete consistency but much might be done by mutual consultation to ensure that similar cases are treated alike.o l (0) If it appears possible that any person may be given the medal by two different authorities the other authority concerned should be consulted. For instance, the military authorities will distribute the medals to certain persons not now serving with the forces, who may be living in your area : e.gr., in Auxiliary Force (India) and Indian Teiritorial Force units and Railway Battalions, to holders of the Order of British India, 1st Class, etc. You should therefore consult the local military autho rities to ensure that your list does not overlap with theirs. (7) No medal should be given to the subject of a Foreign State. (8) Officers of the Indian Medical Service and personnel of the Indian Medical Department, who are in civil employ, will not receive a medal from military sources. 15. It is requested that you should examine these proposals immediately and inform the Government of India at once whether you have any variations to suggest in your allotment of medals. If any of these instructions are obviously inapplicable to conditions in your Agency, the Government of India will be glad to have your remarks urgently : but unless the point is of substantial importance, they would prefer to leave you to make such local adjustments as are necessary. It is not contemplated that you should send any nominal rolls for approval except the names of ladies and certain mili tary officers to whom you propose distribution, but we would be glad of information, by the end of the first week in March, both of your acceptance of your total allotment and of the approximate number of medals which you propose should be issued to ladies, since the number of ribbons in the form of a bow required from England will have to be notified very early. If no information is received by that date, we will assume that our provisional allotment is correct and that you do not propose to give the medal to any ladies ; but we would prefer earlier information from you even if this is correct. The medals will be sent to you as soon as they are received from England and it is hoped that they will in all cases be presented during the Silver Jubilee celebrations. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, B. J. GLANCY, Political Secretary to the Government of India. GIPD—857(C) FAPD—S2—25-2-35—250.© i Telegram Cr. From - Resident, Bahrain.

His Majesty the King Emperor has approved the issue of a Silver Medal to be known a§ “ The King’s Silver Jubilee Medal ”, in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of His Majesty’s accession to the Throne. Some 80,000 Medals will be struck for issue as a personal souvenir from His Majesty to persons in the Crown Services and others throughout the Empire. Individuals selected for the award will receive the Medal on or shortly after the 6th May 1935, but the Medals will not be worn on the 6th May, except by special instruction. The following is a description of the Medal, which has been designed by Sir Goscombe John, R. A. :— Obverse. —Conjoint busts of Their Majesties the King and Queen, crowned and robed, looking to the left, with the inscription around GEORGE V AND QUEEN MARY MAY VI MCMXXXV. Reverse. —The Royal Cypher G. R. I. surmounted by the Crown with the dates MAY 6, 1910 and MAY 6, 1935 on either side, the whole within an ornamental border. The medal will be worn suspended by a ring from a ribbon 1J inch wide with a red centre stripe f inch wide and two blue stripes and one white stripe of equal width on either side. Diameter of medal—1J inch. The King’s Silver Jubilee Medal is classified as an official medal, to be worn, on all occasions on which decorations and medals are worn, on the left breast after all Jubilee, Coronation and Durbar Medals, which follow War Medals in the Order of Precedence. Ladies who have no other decorations or medals will wear the Jubilee Medal on the left shoulder of the dress, the ribbon in this case being in the form of a bow. Ladies who are already in possession of official medals worn on a bar may, if they wish, add the Jubilee Medal to the bar instead of wearing it separately on a bow. Applications from individual members of the public cannot be entertained. The other commemorative medal, which has been prepared by the Royal Mint by His Majesty’s Command for sale to the public, is not classified as an official medal and may not be worn as such. S. C.
