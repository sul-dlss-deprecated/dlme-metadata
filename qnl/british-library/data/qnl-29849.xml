I am desired to refer to Colonel Burnett's off : cial letter No.D. l2073^!S/44, da ted the 22nd August 1944 on the subject of the administrat ive training of Saiyid Tarik Bin Taimur and to say that for the comple tion of his training ^aiyid la ik has been helping with the work of the Chagai Levy Corps since the middle of November and is likely to continue there until h1s return to Muscat some time in March.Saiyid Tarik had bn excellent report from the Commandant of the Zhobkilitia and Emerson f inds him most useful to him in restoring the efficiency of the Levy Corps.Colonel Hay feels that the benefit both to the Levy Corps and to Saiyld Tarik would be much increased if he could be given the appoint ment of Adjutant .Colonel Hay would also like to invest him with third class magisterial powers to s/ve him an opportunity of acquiring some judicial experience in addition to that which he has already been given. 2. 9aiyld Tarik,being the subject of a foreign country,cannot be give^i any post under th*s Administra tion without the orders of the ^ovemor-General.1 am therefore to ask whether his temporary appointment as adjutant of the Chagal Levy Cor pa may be authorised under Section 262(4) of the Government of India Act 1935,and also his eligibility for the office of ?/agi strate Third Class.lt is not in tended to pay any salary or allowances in addition to the allowance which is paid by the Sultan of Muscat#There is thus no financial consideration involved. 3. I am to ask that, if possible,orders may be communicated earl/ in view of the fact that it is desir able to confirm Saiyid Tarik’s position in the Chagai : levy Corps if the best results are to be obtained from his attachment.

D.140964C E/44, New Delhi, The 8th January 1945, My dear Bacon, Please refer to your letter N0.62-P15/44 of the 16th December, about Say§rld Tarik, This has been discussed with Galloway vtio Is here with the Suita ruin the first place the Secretary of Stated sanction would be necessary before Sayyid Tarik could be appointed as Adjutant In the Chagqi Levy Corps, ^ and secondly it is felt fa the that he ou^rt to be paid if he is given a regular appointaent.It would not be worth while to try to put all this through before March. But apart from thatGallowny thinks it unfortunate that 9*yyid Parik should have been sont to Levy Corps work in Chagai atal'. .He had ^Ire- dy done his levy work with the Zhob Militia, and it was desired that he should be given experience in administrative (not including law, for our law and procedure will be no use to one who will have to drainIster Sharia)- what is really wanted is revenue and treasury work,-and Galloway very much hopes that the two months that remain can be devoted to thts.If Sayvid Tarik could learn some thing about the working of a Tahsil,and have explained to him the methods of revenue assessment and collection in Baluchistan,the training would be of the utmost i* value.For this a more populated and •regular* District than Chagai is probably needed. Some idea of budget and accounts work would also be useful.Sayyid Tarik is not A 'in Baluchistan to help us, but in order that we may glee him experience. Galloway would be most grateful if Wei^itman could perhaps give Sayyid Tarik some personal attention of his own.I am to add that Foreign Secretary has been these papers and is in agreement with this letter.

I am afraid Bacon’s demi-official letter No.62-P. 15/ 44 of the 16th December 1944 has created a wrong impression I sent Saiyid Tartk .Chagai because I considered that conditions there approximated more closely to those at ^ Muscat than any where in Baluchistan outside the States and also to give him an opportunity of learning Baluchi, as a very large proportion of the inhabitants of Muscat are ^eluchis and speak th»t laogua e.I asked Emerson particui larly to give him instruction in revenue,law and general administration,! also suggested incidentally that he should help with levies as this would give him plenty of oppor tunity of t alking Bsluchi and he mi:#it gain experience which could be usefully applied to the Muscat Levies. Kmerson later asked that he should be appointed as Adjutant to facilitate his work with the Levies. 3.. In view,however,of the remarks contained in your denrj official letter No.D. 14Q96-M&amp;/44,dated the 8th January 1945 t have now issued instructions for Saiyld Tarik to come to Slbi where T propose that he diould stay until the middle of Varch.Le will spend most of his time doing revenue work and! have asked Pinhey to arrange for the I'ahsildar,who is an ex-Qanungo,to Instruct him and Hasan ^together in the local revenue work.In the middle of March ! propose to send him to Quetta where 1 hope it will be possible for him to reap the benefit of the special arrange meats that are being made for Giver* s education in revenue. I also hope to arrange for him to see something of the work of the Treasury at Quetta.Befo re I sent Saiyid ^arik to Chagai he was attached for six weeks to the Secretariat, where he spent most of the time with the Financial Assis tant learning budget and accounts work. 4. I have noted that it is not desired that Saiyld Tarik should be given any further instruction in law.

In these circumstances, and nrovided you see no objection, it would be appreciated if the position could be explained to Sayyid Tarik Bin Taimur, and if he could be asked whether, in view of his mother's difficult circumstances, he would be prepared to afford her any financial assistance.

Since Eeiyid Tarlq 1 * return from hia totir in the Dhahirah area, which wac reported in the Muacat Ictelligtnce Suoanary l?o.l5 for the fortnight ending 15th. August, 1945, no poet in the Muscat Government bar been allotted to him and I have had sever'd conver sations with the Saltan in regard to finding Tariq suitable emplcy- ment. The Sid ten’s view of his half-brother ie that his poor knowledge of Arabic and his irresponsible attitude towards life rcake it difficult to give him an independent appointment of any * importance and that the best arrangement would be for Tariq to be placed under the British Adviser who would be expected to exercise firm supervision over his work. To ay suggestion that, until an Adviser is found for Muscat, Tariq might work with Mused Levies under the Military Adviser, the Sultan replied that he did not feel that Major Hirst could effectively control him. As an alternative to this J suggested that, as the police arrangements in Muscat and Mat rah left much to be desired, Tariq wight make use of the police training he had had in India to conduct an exstmlnatjon on this ques tion and to draw up a report with proposals for improvem nt. The Sultan accepted the suggestion and as soon as the Id celebrations are over, intends to instruct Tariq accordingly. 3« I have not yet. had an opportunity of assessing Tariq’s worth for myself but am expecting to take him with me on a skowi tour to Sur shortly in order to get to know him bettor. 4- Up own view is that the Sultan’s suggestion that his brother should be placed under the Adviser is a good one, but that in the mean time it is of the greatest importance that Tariq should not be allowed to stagnate.

Until/can meet my son again I would be very pleased to receive, as soon as possible, a few words in his handwriting and signed by him as well as his photograph.

X have discussed this case with the Sul an and he observes that since S&lt; iyid Taimur divorced Hme. Ilgiray. there can be no question of any legal obligation for her maintenance. He agrees, how- ever, that there is perh: ps some moral obligation on Seiyici Tarik to do what he can to support his mother. The difficulty is, however, that Saiyid Tarik is already much in debt anti it is unlikely uhat he will be in a position to offer financial help to his mother without assistance. The Sultan has therefore agreed th; t, while unwilling to grant anything in the nature of a pension, he will from time to time give Saiyid Tarik a gift of money which the latter could then transmit in his own ru me to his mother. 3.

Copy of letter from Madame Kamile Ilgiray dated 11th April 1947j to the British Embassy, Ankara. I am grieved to say that I am still without any answer to my letter of November 8th 1946 in which I expressed together with my wishes, the gratefulness which I feel towards you for the new hope you gave me with your kind letter of October 17th 1946. Under the trying new conditions in which I am at present, I fully realise that waiting and hoping for months and months is useless. You will understand by the eaoclosure that I find myself almost helpless against the sudden situation which is forced nnon me Being unable to keep up with the heavy requirements of my actual occupation I, unhappily have to resign and, to find another suitable job is almost impossible forlme, because, as you know J am an old and sick woman. The last solution I can think of would be to expose my situation to the National Assembly. Before this hopeless attempt I wish to make a last appeal to your kindness. Considering that my requests might have been too heavy and out of season I am ready to reduce them as convenient. If it is not time yet for me to see my son, I will gladly wait for the suitable opportunity to meet him, but meanwhile, I must, at least receive his photograph as was promised to me so as to be able to bear my burden at least with patience. On the other hand, the amount of allowance due to me is, starting from last yeqr*s beginning to end of this month, to the effect of £ 500/-/- (five hundred pounds sterling), this amount representing the sum of five part payments xitkxMiKk which should have been effected to me against my allowance. I appeal, Sir, to your high sense of Justices will you do me the favour of intervening on my behalf so that I may at least receive two payments from my allowance this year. I trust that you will not allow the mother of a highly placed and honourable prince to be an object of public talk. I have asked for a delay extending to the end of this month, and will expect a reply during this period. Will you kindly excuse me for bothering you with my private cares and worries.
