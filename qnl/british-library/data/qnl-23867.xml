In furiated by this insult, the courtiers decide to square the ac count in the battle field, and a challenge is sent to the Shah to that effect. In the battle, however, RAPIq, ALAM is arrested and taken prisoner. Luckily, a fresh Army gallantly led by MARGHOOB arrives at the spot at this critical moment and turns the table. The sud den attack comes as a shock to SHAH TOWER'S tired men, and they run away for their lives. Confident of the tragic end that may be their lot if their remobilised army had to face the well organised army of MARGHOOB, PaRHA suggests to SHAH TOWER that the only course left to avert defeat was to make princess LALA instrumental in the capture of MARGHOOB by her beauty and charm. The plan is successfully carried out, MARGHOOg is taken pri soner and the SHAH orders him to be executed. But the story takes a turn at this juncture; the beauty that snared MARGHOOB becomes itself a prey to the virtues and gallantry of the latter; Lala is upset and determines to avoid, at any cost, bravery coming to an end thus. She rescues MARGHOOB, but by this time her love for MARGHOOB has reached such a height that she turns against her own father. m the final battle SHAH TOWER falls at the hands of RAPI^ ALAM and MARGHOOB^ xKk and the assassin*s loyalty thus is proved.\ I POLITICAL AGENCY, | ■ ' / BAHRAIN. 16/60.
