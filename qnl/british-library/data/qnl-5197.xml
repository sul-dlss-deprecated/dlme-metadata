On the contrary s it is not without relevance to observe that the Hew South Wales Governments after the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the effect of Fart IV of the New South '.'ales Civil Service Act cf 1884 (To „ 48 Victorias Uc.24)? which provided various methods of terminating the engagements of public servants, was to restrict the right of the Crown to dismiss its servants at pleasure, lost no time in amending the Act of 1884 and restoring the full right of the Crown to dismiss at v /illc 3» Moreovers in amy judgment; no practical advantage would be secured to the Services by negativing or limiting this power. At-presents it is never used against an officer, save in the last resorts and for the maintenance of the absolutely essential elements of good administration. One of the consequences which would almost certainly follow from negativing or limiting the right of the Crown to dismiss at will would be that Government would feel obliged ? in the interests of efficier administration, so to regulate the engagement of its officers as to permit of the termination of their services at very short noticeo Another conseouence would be the complete change in th whole character of the relations between the Superior Service and Government which would inevitably follow'. Per the pre Tie nr. relations between the Services and the Cr cy/n ? of trust on th. one side and protecticn on the other ? would be substituted j in part at leasts the right of an officer to seeh a legal remedy ii a court of law.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. HOME DEPARTMENT. From J. D. V. HODGE, Esq ., I.C.S., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, To All LOCAL GOVERNMENTS and ADMINISTRATIONS. New Delhiy the 6th January 1!)27, Subject :— Scojie of Hides 10 [a) and {b) of the Domicile Rules in Appendix B, Schedule IV to the Saperior Civil Services (Revision of Pay, Passage and Pension) Pules. Sir, The Government of India have recently had under consideration certain cases of doubtful domicile in which the question of the effect and scope of rules 10(a) and {h) of the rules for the determination of domicile [Appendix B, Schedule IV, Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay, Passage and Pension^ Rules] was in issue. The question was referred to the Secretary of State in Council, and I am to communicate his decision and observations on the subject, fQj. ^ ie info r mati on and guidance of the Governor in Council, your information and guidance. 2. The considerations stated in rules 10 [a) and (5) form a legitimate ground for deeming an individual officer to have been of Asiatic domicile at the date of his appointment to Government service for the purpose of the Lee Concessions. They do not, however, afford conclusive evidence that his legal domicile was Asiatic either at the date of his appointment or at any other time. Domicile determined under rules 10 (a) or [b) is the domicile assumed for the limited purpose stated above and does not affect the domicile of the next generation, which depends entirely upon the legal domicile of the father for the first 21 years of his children's lives. 3. The conclusion stated ab^ve is of particular importance^in cases where the domicile of a mine r at the date of his appointment to Government service is in question. In determining the domicile of the minor it is essential that the limited effect of a ruling under rules 10(a) and {b) should be recognised. In such cases it will not be sufficient to show that the father was, or isineligible for the concessioiis dependent on domicile by reason of the provisions of either of the rules referred to, since the fact that the father was born and educated in India, while raising a presumption against non Asiatic domicile, would not, for example, be conclusive in face of a non-Asiatic domicile inherited from the previous generation. 4. I am to request that, when the inherited domicile of an individual offuer has to be debsrmined, th.3 considerations stated above as to the limited or personal effect of a ruling under rules 10 {a) and (b) may be borne in mind. Such a ruling in respect of the father should not be regarded as conclusive evidence that he was legally of Asiatic domicile and transmitted the same to his minor sons. An endeavour should be made to obtain further evidence to show the legal domicile of the father, which is what the son actually inherits. I have the honour to be, S ie, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) J. D. V. HODGE, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India* No. F.-30 -11. —25 -1- P olice.

[Published in the Government of India, Home Department, Notification No. F.-.368|22- Establishments, dated the 1st Mareh 1924, as subsequently amended, (corrected up to the 1st June 1927).] ' v t r v&gt; 1 —(!) These rules may be called the Premature Retirement Rules. (2) 1 hey shall be deemed to have come into force in respect of officers serving elsewhere than in Burma on the 8th November 1921, and in respect of officers serving in Burma on the 2nd January 1923. *2.— (1) Any officer who was selected for, or appointed to, one of the services specified in the First Schedule, with effect from a date earlier than the 1st January 1920, and who is not permanently employed directly under the Governor General in Council, m^y be per mitted by the Secretary of State in CounciLto retire under these rules. (2) If any doubt arises as to the date on which any officer was selected for one of the services specified in the First Schedule, the matter shall be referred to the Secretary of state in Council, whose decision shall be final : Provided that no officer of the Indian Army in civil employ who has not been placed on the supernumerary list, and no officer of the Indian Medical Service who has com pleted less than 17 years' total service, shall be eligible to retire under these rules unless the competent military authorities are unable or unwilling to absorb him in military em ployment. 3.—(1) Every application for such permission shall be addressed in the first instance to the Local Government under which the officer is employed, and shall be accompanied by the following declaration, which shall be signed by the applicant :— In view of the changes in the conditions of my service occasioned by the Govern ment of India Act, 1919, I desire to retire on the terms set forth in the rules relating to premature retirement.'' (2) An application under this rule may be submitted by an officer while he is on leave out of India, and in that case, unless the Local Government considers his return to duty necessary before his application can be considered, the rules shall apply to him in the same manner as if his application had been submitted while on.duty : Provided that an officer who has made an application under this rule while he is on leave out of India and whose application is sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council before his leave expires shall not, unless his leave commenced before the 19th January 1924, be eligible for the gratuity described in Rule 11, except to the extent atinus- sible under sub-rule (6) of that rule. 4. On receipt of an application the Local Government shall forward it with their recommendations to the Governor General in Council, who shall transmit it with his recom mendations to the Secretary of State in Council for orders. 5. An officer who has been permitted by the Secretary of State in Council to retire under these rules, or whose application has been forwarded by the Local.Government to the Governor General in Council with a recommendation that his retirement be sanctioned, shall, unless the Local Government sees reason to the contrary, be permitted to avail him self, in anticipation of his retirement, of the full amount of leave which is due to him and which may be granted to him at one time (otherwise than on medical certificate) under the regulations for the time being in force and applicable to him : Provided that if the Local Government considers that leave in anticipation of retire ment should not be granted, or that less than the full anumnt of leaye available under regulations for the time being in force should be granted, the proposal to withhold or reduce the leave applied for shall be submitted with the reasons therefor for the orders of the Secretary of State in Council. 6.—(1) The Local Government shall have discretion to fix the date on which leay.e granted under Rule 5 shall commence : •Amended by the Government of India, Home Department, Notification no. F.-178l28[24-Ests., dated the 6th June 1925. l139hdProvided that an officer who has been granted by the Secretary of State in Council permission to retire under these rules shall not be detained in India beyond the date on which he desires to leave unless his detention cannot be avoided without prejudice to the public interest. (2) If the Local Government considers that suitable arrangements cannot be made for the relief of any officer at the date on which he desires tb proceed on leave preparatory to retirement under these rules, it may, when forwarding his application to the Governor General in Council, recommend that the Secretary of State in Council should postpone the grant of permission and in that case shall specify the period during which such postpone ment should extend. 7. An officer who has submitted an application for permission to retire under these rules, and has been granted leave under Rule 5, shall not be at liberty to cancel his applica tion and to return to duty without the consent of the Local Government under which he was employed. 8.—(1) An officer who has submitted an application for permission to retire under these rules may be permitted to take up other employment during the currency of his leave pre paratory to retirement. (2) Such permission may be granted by the Governor General in Council if the proposed employment lies in India, and by the Secretary of State in Council if the pro posed emloyment lies elsewhere than in India ; Provided that an officer who has been granted permission to take up employment under this rule shall be precluded, save with the specihc consent of the Secretary of State in Council, from withdrawing his request for permission to retire and from returning to duty in India. (3) The Secretary of State in Council and the Governor-General in Council, as the case may be, hereby reserve to themselves the right to withhold permission to take up employment under this rule in cases where the employment appears to them to be such as could not with propriety be held by a person who is still in the service of the Crown in India ; or, alternatively, to grant the desired permission in any such case subject to such conditions or restrictions as they may think necessary. 9.—(1) The right of any officer to receive or retain a pension under the provisions of these rules is subject to the right of the Secretary of State in Council— (a) to reduce or withhold any pension, if the past service of the applicant is not approved, or if the pensioner after retirement is convicted of serious crime or is guilty of grave misconduct ; and (&amp;) in cases where an officer obtains, prior to, or within two years from, the date of his retirement under these rules, other employment under the Crown, to suspend payment, wholly or in part, while the officer continues to be employed under the Crown, of the proportionate pension admissible under these rules. (2) In cases where a proportionate pension is suspended wholly or in part under clause (&amp;) of the preceding sub-rule, the services of the officer shall be transferred to the authority under which he is to be employed, on the understanding that on the terming tion of his employment under the Crown he shall have the option of receiving either (i) a pension in respect of his total service calculated under the rules made by the Treasury under section 7 (1), Superannuation Act, 1909, or (ii) a proportionate pension under these rules in respect of his Indian service together with such pension or pensionary award (if any) as he may earn under the rules of the authority re-employing him, in respect of his services under that authority ; Provided that if the department employing the officer does not consent to a pension calculated under the said Treasury Rules, or if the said Treasury Rules are inapplicable, the services of the officer shall be transferred on the understanding stated in the second alternative in the preceding paragraph. (3) For the purposes of this rule, the expression ' employment under the Crown ' shall be deemed to include employment under the Governments of Crown Colonies, Pro tectorates, and territories mandated to the British Government, but does not include em ployment under the Government of a self-governing Dominion or a State in India, or under a Local Authority. (4) A proportionate pension shall not be liable to suspension either wholly or in part under sub-rule (1) (6) of this rule unless the proportionate pension, when combined with the initial pay of the officer in his new appointment, would exceed the initial pay which he might have received under Rule 51 of the Fundamental Rules if his new employ ment had been on deputation from India. 10. Subject to the provisions of Rule 9, an officer who is granted by the Secretary of State in Council permission to retire under these rules shall be entitled, if he has completedless than five years' total service, to a gratuity equal to one month's pay (at the rate drawn by the applicant while last on duty before his retirement), multiplied by the number of com pleted months of total service at the officer's credit and divided by 12, and converted at the rate of Is. 9d. per rupee ; and, if has completed five years' total service, to a pension of the amount shown in the Second Schedule. 11.— (1) In addition to the pension or gratuity referred to in Rule 10, any officer who has been permitted to retire under these rules (other than an officer who is entitled to the pension specified in the Second Schedule as the maximum pension admissible under these rules to the service to which he belongs, and when more than one method of calculating a pension is prescribed, for the method of calculating the pension actually adopted) and who proceeds on retirement or on leave preparatory to retirement to some part of the British Empire intending to settle there permanently, shall, subject to the provisions of Rule 3 (2), be entitled to receive a gratuity equal to the cost of first-class fares and passages from the last place of his employment in India to his destination for himself, and for his wife and children if they were in India at the time of his proceeding on leave preparatory to retirement : *Provided that except with the special sanction of the Secretary of State in Council no gratuity shall be payable under this rule to an officer who is permitted to retire or to proceed on leave preparatory to retirement while employed elsewhere than in India and the amount of the gratuity (if any) payable to such an officer shall be such as the Secretary of State in Council shall direct : tProvided further that where there is no railway or steamer station at the last place of employment of an officer permitted to retire under these rules, the local Gl-overnment may, at its discretion, include in the gratuity of such officers an amount equivalent to the mileage allowance for his journey to the nearest station which would have been admissible to him under the travelling allowance rules in force in his province. (2) For purposes of payment of this gratuity to officers proceeding to or via the United Kingdom, first-class fares and passages, in the case of officers last employed in India, excluding Burma, shall be first-class steamer or railway fares to Bombay plus cost of first- class passage at B rates by the P. and 0. Steam Navigation Company to London (all sea route) ; and in the case of officers last employed in Burma, first-class railway or steamer fares to Rangoon plus cost of first-class passage by the Bibby Line to London (all sea route) ; and, in both cases, railway fares froq? London to destination. These rates are payable irrespective of the line or class by which an officer or his family travels. (3) Payment of the gratuity (excluding that portion representing railway fares from London, which shall be paid by the High Commissioner) shall be made by the Local Government concerned before the officer leaves India. (4) A local Government may at its discretion sanction the payment of a gratuity calculated as in sub-rules (1) and (2) of this rule, but excluding the fares and passages of the officer himself, to the families of officers who are obliged by climatic or analogous reasons to leave later than the officer himself, or in advance of the officer but subsequent to the sub mission of his application to retire. (5) An officer who applies in India for permission to retire and who is permitted to leave India in anticipation of the sanction of the Secretary of State in Council is eli&lt;?ib 1 e for the gratuity. In such cases, if the officer proceeds to the United Kingdom, the Local Government shall authorise the High Commissioner to make payment. (6) Officers who apply to retire while on leave in England and whose families are in India at the time when their retirement was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council, shall receive a portion of the gratuity equal to the cost of first-class railway fares and passages for their families when the latter leave India. (7) In no case shall a gratuity or any portion thereof be payable until the Sec retary of State in Council has sanctioned the officer's retirement under these rules. 1(8) The gratuity admissible under this rule shall be reduced by the value of any benefit received from the General Passage Fund in respect of the journey referred to in sub-rule (1) above. (9) The gratuity paid to an officer under this rule shall, in the event of his being permitted to return to duty in India, be refunded. Such refunds may be made by deduc tions of 36 equal monthly instalments from the officer's pay-bill, commencing with the first pay-bill drawn after return. *Added by the Government of India, Hojpe Department, Notification no.

(1) A member of the Indian Civil Service who. retires under these rules may adopt at his option any one of the three following methods of retaining for his wife arid children benefits admissible under the* Indian Civil Service Family Pension Regulations, namely :— (a) He may cease to make any contributions and payments under the regulations, and shall then retain only the right to a proportion of the contingent benefits under the regulations for his Avife and children existing on the date of retire ment, and for any children subsequently born to that wife. This proportion shall be equal to the number of his completed years' total service divided by 25. and the calculation shall be based upon the pension admissible to the widow of an officer of the class to which he belonged at the time of his re tirement. (h) He may continue up to his 51st birthday-fo make contributions under the regu lations at the rates payable by him at the date of retirement, and shall then retain the right to the full contingent benefits admissible under the rdgula- * \ tions, according to his class on the date of his retirement, for his wife existing at the date of retirement, and for any children by her, whether born before or after retirement. Under this alternative subscriptions will be payable under the ordinary regulations for each child, whether born before or after retire- ment. In the event of the death of the wife, subscriptions at the bachelor rate appropriate to the subscriber's class on retirement will be payable until age 51. (c) He may continue up to his 51st birthday to make contributions and payments under the regulations at the rates which would have been payable by him from time to time had he remained in the service. In that case he shall retain the full benefits admissible under the regulations as if he had remained in the service until death or retirement with an ordinary perision. ^Provided that, in the event of the officer failing to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the method selected by him, he shall be'deemed to have elected the first of the above methods. (2) The Secretary of State in Council shall make good to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund under a suitable procedure' agiy loss which may be estimated to be thrown upon it by the operation of this rule. 13.—(1) An officer of the Indian Army or of the Indian Medical Service who retires under these mles may select any one of the three following options with regard to his sub- scriptions under the Indian Military. Service Family Pension Regulations or to the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund {a) He may continue to subscribe at the half rate of subscription under Article 28 of the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations or Rule 32 of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund ; or if a married subscriber under the Indian Milifary Service Family Pension Regulations, he may withdraw, receiving the refund authorised by Article 28. If lir 1 continues to subscribe he will retain the same rights to contingent benefits from the funds as if he had retired under the ordinary rules. (&amp;) He may cease to make any payments under the regulations except in so far as is provided by the last sentence of this clause, and shall then retain the right to contingent benefits at the ratos admissible under the regulations to the widow and children of an Officer of the class to which he belonged at the date of retirement, for his wife and children existing at that date, and for any children subsequently born to that wife. Under this alternative, any donatiori payable under the ordinary rules for any child born after retirement must, however, ' ; paid by the officer if he desires to retain any right to continuance of benefits for any such child. (c) He may continue up to his 55th birthday to make payments under the Regula tions at the full rates applicable to the class which he would have attained had he remained in the service until that date, and thereafter at half rates aecoi ding to the class in which he is then sfthseribing. Any donation becom ing due after age 55 will be payable in full as in the case of ordinary retire ments. His wife and children will in this case be- eligible for the full benefits appropriate to the class in which he 4 is subscribing at the date of death. The Secretary of State in Council shall make good to the Indian Military Service Family Pension.

(3) The family of a military officer or Of ari officer of the Indian Medical Service who retires under these Kulds shall retain thdir contingent rights to pensions under the Royal Warrant if the officer had on retirement cbrtipMted ^0 years' service. If such an officer is permitted to retire Under these Rules after completing less than 20 years' service, the Secretary of State in Council shall, on the death of the officer, grant, subject to condi tions identical with those laid down in the Royal Warrant (other than the condition re quiring an officer to have completed 20 years' service in order to entitle his widow or children to pensions)— to his widow, a yearly pension of 70/. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure corre sponding to the number of years' total service completed by the officer at the date of his retirement ; and to each child, a pension of 16/. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure as aforesaid, dt, in the case of a motherless child, a pensibn of 25/. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure as aforesaid. *14. An officer awarded a proportionate pension may be permitted to commute a portion of his pension, not exceeding one-third of the whoJe, unless in the opinion of the sanctioning authority (the Local Government under which the officer was last employed for an officer who draws his pension directly or indirectly from Indian Treasuries, and the High Commissioner in all other cases) there are exceptional reasons for refusing sanc tion to the application in whole or in part. Tf the sanctioning authority considers that such reasons exist, the case shall be referred for the decision of the Secretary of State in Council. 15. An offiber in Europe desirous of commuting shall make application in writing to the High Commissioner for India, stating his desire so to commute, and furnishing information as to his age and the reasons on which he bases his request. Permission to commute in sterling will not ordinarily be granted by the High Commissioner to an officer residing only temporarily out of India. Commutation in his case will ordinarily be dealt with by the authorities in India. 16; If the High Commissioner for India approves the commutation, the officer shall be so informed and his application shall be referred to the Medical Board at the India Office IT. The Board shall require the officer to give such information as to his health and habits as is usual in the case of persons proposing to assure their lives in assurahce com panies, and he shall be required to submit himself for personal examination by the Board at the India Office. 18. An officer residing in a Dominion or Colony (other than those whose accounts are adjusted direct with. Indian Treasuries) and desirous of commuting will be required to follow a procedure similar to that in the case of an officer residing in Europe, except that he shall apply to the High Commissioner for India through the official from whom he draws his pension. If the application is approved the officer shall be informed accord ingly, and a special civil medical board Will be assembled under the orders of the local Colonial Government. The Medical Board shall report in the following form :— ' We have carefully examined and : are of opinion that he is (or is not) in good bodily health, and has (or has not) the prospect of an average dura tion of life. We therefore (or do riot) recommend compliance with his application to be allowed to- capitalise a portion of his pension '. In the case of impaired lives in which compliance with the officer's application is recommended, but with an addition of years of age, the following shall be added :—' but as he is suffering his age for purposes of commutation should be taken to be years 19. The basis of commutation, subject to an addition of years of age in the case of impaired lives, shall be the following table, the age of the officer being' reckoned at the *Ruies 14 to 23 onclusive have been superseded, with effect mfei the 1st April 1925, by the Civil Pensions (Commutation) Rules published in the Government of India, Finance Department, Notification no.

(2) If the Local Government considers that suitable arrangements cannot be made for the relief of any officer at the date on which he desires to proceed on leave preparatory to retirement under these rules, it may. when forwarding his application to the Governor General in Council, recommend that the Secretary of State in Council should postpone the grant of permission and in that case shall specify the period during which such postpone ment should extend. 7. An officer who has submitted an application for permission to retire under these rules, and has been granted leave under Rule 5, shall not be at liberty to cancel his applica tion and to return to duty without the consent of the Local Government under which he was employed. 8.—(1) An officer who has submitted an application for permission to retire under these rules may be permitted to take up other employment during the currency of his leave pre paratory to retirement. (2) Such permission may be granted by the Governor General in Council if the proposed employment lies in India, and by the Secretary of State in Council if the pro posed emloyment lies elsewhere than in India : Provided that an officer who has been granted permission to take up employment under this rule shall be precluded, save with the specific consent of the Secretary of State in Council, from withdrawing his request for permission to retire and from returning to duty in India. (3) The Secretary of State in Council and the Governor-General in Council, as the case may be, hereby reserve to themselves the right to withhold permission to take up employment under this rule in cases where the employment appears to them to be such as could not with propriety be held by a person who is still in the service of the Crown in India ; or, alternatively, to grant the desired permission in any such case subject to such conditions or restrictions as they may think necessary. 9.—(1) The right of any officer to receive or retain a pension under the provisions of these rules is subject to the right of the Secretary of State in Council— (a) to reduce or withhold any pension, if the past service of the applicant is not approved, or if the pensioner after retirement is convicted of serious crime or is guilty of grave misconduct ; and (&amp;) in cases where an officer obtains, prior to, or within two years from, the date of his retirement under these rules, other employment under the Crown, to suspend payment, wholly or in part, while the officer continues to be employed under the Crown, of the proportionate pension admissible under these rules. (2) In cases where a proportionate pension is suspended wholly or in part under clause (6) of the preceding sub-rule, the services of the officer shall be transferred to the authority under which he is to be employed, bn the understanding that on the termim tion of his employment under the Crown he shall have the option of receiving either (i) a pension in respect of his total service calculated under the rules made by the Treasury under section 7 (1), Superannuation Act, 1909, or (ii) a proportionate pension under these rules in respect of his Indian service together with such pension or pensionary award (if any) as he may earn under the rules of the authority re-employing him, in respect of his services under that authority : Provided that if the department employing the officer does not consent to a pension calculated under the said Treasury Rules, or if the said Treasury Rules are inapplicable the services of the officer shall be transferred on the understanding stated in the second alternative in the preceding paragraph. (3) For the purposes of this rule, the expression ' employment under the Crown ' shall be deemed to include employment under the Governments of Crown Colonies, Pro tectorates, and territories mandated to the British Government, but does not include em ployment under the Government of a self-governing Dominion or a State in India, or under a Local Authority. (4) A proportionate pension shall not be liable to suspension either wholly or in part under sub-rule (1) (&amp;) of this rule unless the proportionate pension, when combined with the initial pay of the officer in his new appointment, would exceed the initial pay which he might have received under Rule 51 of the Fundamental Rules if his new employ ment had been on deputation from India. 10. Subject to the provisions of Rule 9, an officer who is granted by the Secretary of State in Council permission to retire under these rules shall be entitled, if he has completedXXr 'V ^ It ^ less than five years' total service, to a gratuity equal to one month's pay (at the rate drawn by the applicant while last on duty before his retirement), multiplied by the number of com pleted months of total service at the officer's credit and divided by 12, and converted at the rate of 1.?. 9(^. per rupee ; and, if has completed five years' total service, to a pension of the amount shown in the Second Schedule. (1) addition to the pension or gratuity referred to in Rule 10, any officer who has been permitted tO' retire under these rules (other than an officer who is entitled to the pension specified in the Second Schedule as the maximum pension admissible under these i ules to the service to which he belongs, and when more than one method of calculat'ng a pension is prescribed, for the method of calculating the pension actually adopted) and who pioceeds on retirement or on leave preparatory to retirement to some part of the British Empire intending to settle there permanently, shall, subject to the provisions of Rule 3 (2), be entitled to receive a gratuity equal to the cost of first-class fares and passages from the last place of his employment in India to his destination for himself, and for his w ; fe and childien if they were in India at the time of his proceeding on leave preparatory to retirement : *Provided that except with the special sanction of the Secretary of State in Council no gratuity shall be payable under this rule to an officer who is permitted to retire or to proceed on leave preparatory to retirement while employed elsewhere than in India and the amount of the gratuity (if any) payable to such an officer shall be such as the Secretary of State in Council shall direct : tProvided further that where there is no railway or steamer station at the last place of employment of an officer permitted to retire under these rules, the local Government may, at its discretion, include in the gratuity of such officers an amount equivalent to the mileage allowance for his journey to the nearest station which would have been admissible to him under the travelling allowance rules in force in his province. (2) For purposes of payment of this gratuity to officers proceeding to or via the I niied Kingdom, first-class fares and passages, in the case of officers last employed in India, excluding Burma, shall be first-class steamer or railway fares to Bombay plus cost of first- class passage at B rates by the P. and 0. Steam Navigation Company to London (all sea route) ; and in the case of officers last employed in Burma, first-class railway or steamer fares to Rangoon plus cost of first-class passage- by the Bibby Line to London (all sea route) ; and, in both cases, railway fares from London to destination. These rates are payable irrespective of the line or class by which an officer or his family travels. (3) Payment of the gratuity (excluding that portion representing railway fares from London, which shall be paid by the High Commissioner) shall be made by the Local Government concerned before the officer leaves India. (4) A local Government may at its discretion sanction the payment of a gratuity calculated as in sub-rules (1) and (2) of this rule, but excluding the fares and passages of the officer himself, to the families of officers who are obliged by climatic or analogous reasonis to leave later than the officer himself, or in advance of the officer but subsequent to the sub mission of his application to retire. (5) An officer who applies in India for permission to retire and who is permitted to leave India in anticipation of the sanction of tbe Secretary of State in Council is eligible for the gratuity. In such cases, if the officer proceeds to the United Kingdom, the Local Government shall authorise the Hiofh Commissioner to make payment. ffi) Officers who apply to retire while on leave in England and whose families are in India at the time when their retirement was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council, shall receive a. portion of the gratuity equal to the cost of first-class railway fares and passages for their f amilies when the latter leave India. (7) In no case shall a gratuity or any portion thereof be payable until the Sec retary of State in Council has sanctioned the officer's retirement under these rules. |(8) The gratuity admissible under this rule shall be reduced by the value of any benefit received from the General Passage Fund in respect of the journey referred to in sub-rule (1) above. (9) The gratuity paid to an officer under this rule shall, in the event of his being permitted to return to duty in India, be refunded. Such refunds may be made by deduc tions of 36 equal monthly instalments from the officer's pay-bill, commencing with the first pay-bill drawn after return. * Added by the Government of India, Home Department, Notification no.

This proportion shall be equal to the number of his completed years' total service divided by 25. and the calculation shall be based upon the pension admissible to the widow of an officer of the class to which he belonged at the time of his re tirement. (б) He may continue up to his 51st birthday to make contributions under the regu lations at the rates payable by him at the date of retirement, and shall then retain the right to the full contingent benefits admissible under the regula tions, according to his class on the date of his retirement, for his wife existing at the date of retirement, and for any children by her, whether born before or after retirement. Under this alternative subscriptions will be payable under the ordinary regulations for each child, whether born before or after retire ment. In the event of the death of the wife, subscriptions at the bachelor rate appropriate to the subscriber's class on retirement will be payable until age 51. (c) He may continue, up to his 51st birthday to make contributions and payments under the regulations at the rates which would have been payable by him from time to time had he remained in the service. In that case he shall retain the full benefits admissible under the regulations as if he had remained in the service until death or retirement with an ordinary pension. •Provided that, in the event of the officer failing to notify within three months of the date of his retirement the method selected by him, he shall be deemed to have elected the first of the above methods. (2) The Secretary of State in Council shall make good to the Indian Civil Service Family Pension Fund under a suitable procedure any loss which may be estimated to be thrown upon it by the operation of this rule. 13.—(1) An officer of the Indian Army or of the Indian Medical Service who retires under these rales may select any one of the three following options with regard to his sub scriptions under the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations or to the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund :— (a) He may continue to subscribe at the half rate of subscription under Article 28 of the Indian Military Service Familv Pension Herniations or 'Rule 32 of the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund ; or if a married subscriber under the Indian Military Service Family Pension Regulations, he may withdraw, receiving the refund authorised by Article 28. If he continues to subscribe he will retain the same rights to contingent benefits from the funds as if he had retired under the ordinary rules. (b) He may cease to make any payments under the regulations except in so far as is provided by the last sentence of this clause, and shall then retain the right to contingent benefits at the rates admissible under the regulations to the widow and children of an officer of the class to which he belonged at the date of retirement, for his wife and children existing at that date, and for any children subsequently born to that wife. Under this alternative, any donation payable under the ordinary rules for any child born after retirement must, however, be paid by the officer if he desires to retain any right to continuance of benefits for any such child. (c) He may continue up to his 55th birthday to make payments under the Regula tions at the full rates applicable to the class which he would have attained had he remained in the service until that date, and thereafter at half rates according to the class in which he is then subscribing. Any donation becom ing due after age 55 will be payable in full as in the case of ordinary retire ments. His wife and children will in this case be eligible for the full benefits appropriate to the class in which he is subscribing at the date of death. (2) The Secretary of State in Council shall make good to the Indian Military Service Family Pension Scheme or the Indian Military Widows' and Orphans' Fund, as •Added by the Government of India, Home Department, Notification no. F.-178l28[24-Ests.j dated the 6th June 1925.^5' f J. I &gt; -4 § the case may be, any loss which may he estimated to he thro-wn upon them by the operation of this rule. • (3) The family of a military officer or of an officer of the Indian Medical Service who retires under these Rules shall retain their contingent rights to pensions under the Royal Warrant if the officer had on retirement completed 20 years' service. If such an officer is permitted to retire under these Rules after completing less than 20 years' service, the Secretary of State in Council shall, on the death of the officer, grant, subject to condi tions identical with those laid down in the Royal Warrant (other than the condition re quiring an officer to have completed 20 years' service in order to entitle his widow or children to pensions)— to his widow, a yearly pension of 70/. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure corre sponding to the number of years' total service completed by the officer at the date of his retirement ; and to each child, a pension of 167. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure as aforesaid, Or, in the case of a motherless child, a pension of 25?. divided by 20 and multiplied by a figure as aforesaid. *14. An officer awarded a proportionate pension may be permitted to commute a portion of his pension, not exceeding one-third of the whole, unless in the opinion of the sanctioning authority (the Local Government under which the officer was last employed for an officer who draws his pension directly or indirectly from Indian Treasuries, and the High Commissioner in all other cases) there are exceptional reasons for refusing sanc tion to the application in whole or in part. If the sanctioning authority considers that such reasons exist, the case shall be referred for the decision of the Secretary of State in Council. 15. An officer in Europe desirous of commuting shall make application in writing to the High Commissioner for India, stating his desire so to commute, and furnishing information as to his age and the reasons on which he bases his request. Permission to commute in sterling will not ordinarily be granted by the High Commissioner to an officer residing only temporarily out of India. Commutation in his case will oidinarily be dealt with by the authorities in India. 16. If the High Commissioner for India approves the commutation, the officer shall be so informed and his application shall be referred to the Medical Board at the India Office 17. The Board shall require the officer to give such information as to his health and habits as is usual in the case of persons proposing to assure their lives in dssiirance com panies, and he shall be required to submit himself for personal examination by the Board at the India Office. 18. An officer residing in a Dominion or Colony (other than those whose accounts are Adjusted direct with Indian Treasuries) and desirous of commuting will be required to follow a procedure similar to that in the case of an officer residing in Europe, except that he shall apply to the High Commissioner for India through the official from whom he draws his pension. If the application is approved the officer shall be informed accord ingly, and a special civil medical board will be assembled under the orders of the local Colonial Government. The Medical Board shall report in the following form :— ' We have carefully examined arid are of opinion that he is (or is not) in good bodily health, and has (or has not) the prospect of an average dura tion of life. We therefore (or do not) recommend compliance with his application to be allowed to capitalise a portion of his pension '. In the case of impaired lives in which compliance with the officer's application is recommended, but with an addition of yeais of age, the following shall be added ' but as he is suffering his age for purposes of commutation should be taken to be years '. 19 The basis of commutation, subject to an addition of years of age in the case of impaired lives, shall be the following table, the age of the officer being reckoned at the * Rules 14 to 23 onclusive have been superseded, with el led from the 1st Api il in„o.

In the specific case in which the question was raised, the Aufiit Officer did in fact give the officer concerned the benefit of the Dreif period of his career which counbeo as active service under Article ^(i)., and the Government 01 India have no reason to suppose that Audit Officers elsewhere have insisted on a rigW interpretation of paragraph 1(hJ of the Schedule. In view,'however, of the fact that it has more than once heen emphasised that a statutory rule should he interpreted strictly and literally, the Government of India consider that it will in due course he necessary to amend the schedule so as to make active service include not only the periods specified in Article 9, Civil Sertice Regulations, hut also any other periods, sueh as those mentioned above, which are treated as active service for the purpose of calculating ordinary pension. As, however, the fundamental tension Hales are now under consideration, they woult. appear that the form of amendment of the Schedule to the Premature Ketirement Rules chouia be settled after the new Pension rules are promulgated, for the present they recommend witn t .e concurance of the Auditor General, that the practiae, as stated above, of giving the term 'active service' a wider significance than is strictly permissible under the rule should continue, and propose, if the secretary of state has no obj ection, to follow this course#sr' Letter from the India orfice, No. S. &amp; Gr. 3662/28, dated the 4th September 1928.

Date of expiry of the privilege of retirement on proportionate pension- I am directed to forward, for the consideration and orders of the Secretary of Letter from the Government of Bombay, No. ^'^e in Council, a Copy of the papers noted 967-F., dated the 6th June 1928, and enclosure, on the margin, in which the question of the Letter from the Government of Bihar and date of expiry of the privilege of retiring on R ' ^ 2nd July Proportionate pension has been raised. g M f I'ton'' Secretarv of State is aware, the original time-limit the 31st March 1!&gt;24 ) was abolished m 1922, and under the terms of the announcement made in the Home Department notification no. F.-267-Bsts., dated the 5th July 1922 the option of retiring on proportionate pension was continued and can be exercised until the action proposed to be taken on the Report of the Parliamentary Commis sion provided for by the Government of India Act is known. It will be remembered that the Government of India in their telegram no. 433, dated the 22nd May 1922 did not favour the suggestion that the time-limit should be entirely removed but recommended that the option should be extended up to the 31st March 1930 as by that tune officers would nave an opportunity of knowing what further constitutional changes were impending and what safeguards would be introduced for their protec- tion. W hile accepting this recommendation in substance, the Secretary of State definitl S' 1 w' 2254 ', dat&lt; ; d ^ 13th June 1922 &gt; considered it inadvisable to fix a definite date. He apprehended that attempts to fix a definite date so far ahead with ihT \ an TS ch COuld n0t be P reoisel y dated w onld cause difficulty and would not improbably arouse suspicion as to the possible intentions of Government and consequently adopted the formula stated in the Resolution of 1922. » r,J' Wh + ile gf. neraI f terms in .'hich the Resolution is expressed have aroused a not unnatural feeling of uncertainty in the Services, the Government of India do not consider it possible to make any more definite pronouncement at this iunoture taken tWor^r/rt aWalt Commission's recommendations and the decisions taken thereon. At the same time there was certainly no intention of rushimj the R?sXt S i 01 tf t a rt ng i lP r I t0 tak ? a leap in the dark - was stated m the Resolution that the whole situation would be reviewed when future developments were known, and it was obviously contemplated that officers would be given a reasonable opportunity of reaching a final decision.

Subject :— Interpretation of the Passage Regulations, Sm, I am directed to invite a reference to Home Department letter no. F.-17/24/ 26-Ests., dated the 7th Jnly 1926, communicating the ruling of the Secretary of State in Council that any part of a journey however broken, which, if booked through, would come within the terms of the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay, Passage and Pension) Rules, 1924, may be regarded as a journey from a port in India within the meaning of the passage regulations. It has been represented to the Government of India that some misunderstanding exists as to the exact scope of this ruling. In some cases, this ruling has been interpreted so as to admit the cost of Railway journeys between Calcutta and Bombay in the case of officers journeying from Rangoon to the United Kingdom via Calcutta and i&gt;ombay on through tickets supplied by Passenger Agents. 1 am to state that this procedure is not correct. The ruling in question does not render nugatory the provisions in regulation (2) of Part II of the Supplementary Passage Regulations under which the cost of railway journeys performed by an officer in India or in the country of destination is not debited to the personal passage account of the officer concerned. I am accordingly to request that this explanation of the ruling mentioned above may be brought to the notice of the authorities concerned for strict observance.

S ubject :— Salaries—Sterling overseas fay—Officer on leave in the United Kingdom drawing rupee leave pay in India—Liability to tax of sterling pay—. The question has been raised whether, under section 18 {2a) of the Indian Income-tax Act, XI of 1922, that part of his leave salary that is paid in sterling in the United Kingdom to an officer on leave out of India should be included in the income from which tax is deducted at source by the officer paying him the rupee portion of the leave salary in India. 2. Section 18 (2&lt;2) of the Indian Income-tax Act provides that all payments on account of salary made out of India by and on behalf of the Government shall be included in the amount on which tax is deducted at source in India. The section does not differentiate between payments made during leave and payments made when on duty.. But all leave salary paid out of India to Government servants on leave out of India has been exempted from tax under a Notification issued under section 60 of the Indian Income- tax Act. (See paragraph 16 of the Income-tax Manual.) Any sterling overseas pay or other sum that may be paid outside India to an officer on leave out of India on account of his salary while on leave is, therefore, exempt from Indian Income-tax. The fact (that a part of the leave salary is drawn in India does not affect, the exemption of the balance drawn in the United (Kingdom. 3. The same principle applies to other payments falling under 'salaries' within the meaning of Section 7 of the Indian Income-tax Act made partly in India and partly out of India and exempt under any notification issued under section 60 of the Indian Income-tax x \ct, for example, the salary paid in the United Kingdom to an officer on duty in that country.

Appeals against reoommendations of the India Office Medical Board for invaliding officers from service. Sir, In reply to your letter No.A.R.7^07, dated the 17th May 1928, on the above subject, I am directed to say that the Government of India accept the procedure suggested by the High Commissioner and authorise him to deal with appeals preferred against the recommendations of the India Office Medical Board invaliding officers from service, in so far as Government servants appointed by the. Central Government are coneerned. ^ u | imjm ,1 1 mi 'hy f.hm nr&gt;a .-ay^narl . In regard tO Government servants appointed by Provincial Governments, the latter are being requested to address the High Commissioner direct on the matter. I have, etc.. Sd • C .N. Chaclrraburt y, Asstte Secretary to the Govt, of India^ 'Mi'i 1 I kh Oopy of a latter No.A.Xi.7307 dated the 17tli Liay 1928, from the Secretary to the Higli ComnisGioner for India, Aocounts Department,Ito the Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department, Simla. w Appeals against recommendations of the India Office Medical Board. 1 an Erected to say that, in March 1984, the Secretary of State for India in Council made rules to regulate the procedure to be adopted in the case of appeals made by officers against recommendations of the India Office Medical Board. These rules provide that the Secretary of State will decide in each case on its merits whether an appeal will be allowed, that prima 'acia evidence must be produced by the applicant that he lias good grounds lor appeal and that his application must be submitted ithin one month ot the date of the letter commvfcating to him the decision against which the appeal is ma^e. The applicant is required to pay a fee for his examination by the Medical Appeal Board which is returned to him if his appeal is successful. 2. Since these rules have been in operation it has been the practice of tnis office, on receipt of a recommendation from the Board that an officer on leave should be invalided from the service, to issue instructions to the officer concerned in the form of which a specimen is enclosed. If the officer intimates ins intention to appeal, the decision as to whether such appeal may be allowed has been made by the Secretary of State. 3. It will be observed from the enclosed copy of a letter dated the 23rd April 1928 from the India Office that the Secretary of State in Council has now decided that he will not deal in future with applications for permission to appear before an appeal board made by officers of civil departments other than those appointed by himself. Assuming that the Government of India will desire to retain in the case of officers not appointed'r? f appoint ad by the Saorotary of St at a in Council tlia axi sting rules regulating appeals they may feel disposed to constitute the High Conmissionar as the authority which will decide whether an appeal is to be allowed. In that case no alteration in procedure will b© necessary other than the substitution of the Hi&amp;h CoTnndssioner for the Secretary of State. Where an appeal to a second board has been permitted and made, if the appeal board upholds the recommendation made by the original board the officer concerned will be instrtioted by the High Commissioner to submit his application for permission to retfera If the appeal board disagrees with the recommendation of the original board it will presumably recommend e„n extension of leave, which will then be granted by the High. Commissioner and reported to the appropriate authority in India. 4. Pending the receipt of orders from the Government of India the High Commissioner proposes to follow the procedure indicated in the preceding paragraph in any cases requiring disposal» Copy of letter from the Under Secretary of State, Services and General Department, India Office, to the High Commissioner for India, dated 23rd April 1928. S.&amp;G.1805/1928. I am directed to refer to the recent appeals of Messrs Norman, Myo and Fernandas against the recommendations of the Medical Board that they x should be invalided from Government Service and to inform you that the Secretary of State has had under consideration certain questions arising out of these appeals. The orders passed in 1924 regulating appeals to the Medical Appeal Board were framed with reference primarily to officers the termination or continuance of whose service lies within the control of' the Secretary of State in Council, and in consequence the standard letter notifying an officer of the orders of invaliding and of the conditions under which lie k i I ' J I' P jg V m 9lie night appeal g tat eel that if he wished to appeal he should apply to the Secretary of State in Council by whom ( if at all] permiGeion to appear before the Medical Appeal Board would b© given. Tiii g direction is appropriate in the case of officers of the All-India Services and others appointed by the Secretary of State in Council, but in the case of officers of provincial and subordinate services and others appointed by authorities in India it would appear more appropriate that the authority with whom it lies to determine the continuance or termination ' of the officer's service should decide also whether an appeal is to be permitted and proscribe the conditions under which it ray be made. The Secretary of State in Council has there- . fore decided that he will not deal in future with applications for permission to appear before the Medical Appeal Board by officers of civil departments whom it is proposed to invalid, other than those appointed by himself and I am to request that the form of letter notifying officers of invalid ing may be modified accordingly. No change will be required in the case of civilian personnel of the Army Department and military personnel in Civil employ who for purposes of leave may be under the orders of the High Commissioner but who were appointed by the Secretary of State in Council. You. will nofe* doubt address the Government of India in due course as to the appeal procedure (if any) to be followed in the case of those officers whose applications will not fall to be dealt with by the Secretary of State in Council, but it would appear that for the present the situation would be met by substituting tli© High Commissioner for India for the Secretary of State as the authority to whom they are invited to address their application. The machinery by which orders shall eventually be passed on the recommendation of Appeal Boards in such cases would appear also to be a matter on whi -li the Government of IndiaW% India niglit with advantage bo oonsulted. Office or the Higli CommiGoioner for India ( Accounts Department). DRAFT LETTER. Sir, I an directed to inform you that the Medical Board at tiie India Office before which you appeared on the reports that you are inoapacitiated for further service in India and reconnends that you be invalided. If you wish to appeal against the decision of the Board you should address (through the High OonmisEioner for India) an application to the Under Secretary of State for India ( Department). India ufiice, London, S.W.I. Tile Sooretary of State for India will then decide, on the merits of the case, whether an apneal siiould be allowed. I aK&gt; however, to state that before an application for an appeal can be considered it is essential- (a^ thai, gr-ir.afaoie evidence be produced that there are good grounde for appealj and (b) that tlio application be submitted within one month of the date of this letter. 2. If the appeal bo allowed you would be required to pay a fee, at present fixed at £5.- (three pounds). On receipt of this fee arrangements would be made for the assembling of a Medical Appeal Board at the India Office. In the event of the appoal being successful the fee would be returned. 3. If you do not desire to appeal you should at once apply i-o thy aut- onties in India for permission to retire from the service of Government with effect from the 192, the day following the end of your leave, and for the grant of such ' Pension or Gratuity as may be admissible under the Regulations.

The term 'approved service' is being substituted for the term 'special energy and efficiency' in the rule corresponding to Article 475A in the draft rules regulating the pensions of the Secretary of State's services which are now under preparation: similar action will be taken in the rules regulating the pensions of the Governor General in Council's services when these come to be framed! and local Governments will doubtless consider the advisability of doing likewise if they make any corresponding rule in the pension rules which they frame in the exercise of their own powers.

Secretary to Government, United Provinces, to the Secretary dated tSlthC 11^'* in * a0 * Ho. 1659-C. , I an directed to refer to Mr. Tennant's letter Ho. F.52/11-R.11/23, dated March 14th, 1928 and to make the following observations for the information of the Governraent of India, 2. The selection posts which carry additional pensions under Articles 475, 475-A and 643 of the Civil Service Regulations have specially heavy responsibilities and only officers with special capabilities can fill them. A high standard of efficiency is demanded of sucn officers and unless they attain that standard their service cannot be regarded as worthy of approval. In other words such an officer becomes eligible for the additional pension if he has rendered service which is up to the standard demanded m that post, and which is, therefore, worthy of approval in that post .3* To hold that Jb^jsraxEi •approve^ service' oeanc service which has not been so unsatisfactory as to justify the ramoYal or re version of the officer, is really to substitute for the word 'approved' the words ,? not disapproved'. ?o suggest on the other hand that the term 'special energy and efficiency' means 'special' amongst the incumbents of a post that requires a high standard of energy and efficiency, is going too far in the other direction. Jz would mean that on?ty the most exceptionally efficient officers would draw the additional pension - v/hich v/ould then go not (as was obviously intended) to any officer who can work up to the standard required of him, but only to sucn as can exceed that standard, may be argued rfetaoax that if the term 'approved service 1 is tnus defined, then most officers who have held these selection posts will get the additional pension. That, however ? is not necessarily the oasee i^or instance, as has already been pointed out, officers of specially high qualifications are required for such posts. But in practice only the best man available can be appointed? and he r though the best available, may not be quite up to, tne standard which the post demands^ Again, an officer apparently well qualified may disappoint expectations^ or he may start well and end badlyc In all these cases, the officers concerned would not nave rendered 'approved service' in the sense suggested, and consequently would not be entitled to additional pension* 5. The Governor in Council considers, therefore, that the question whether service is approved or not can only be decided on the merits of each 'indiv.fdual caser But the worth of the service must be measured against the standard required in the post* On the one hand, it must not be assumed that every incumbent of such a post is up to that standard, as a matter of courses nor-, * on the other hand, must it be held that to. earn the pension he must exceed that standard* His Excellency in Council is not convincedconvinced that it ia necessary to reinterpret the term- ^approved aervice 11 , since any such reinterprets.tion would probably restrict the discretion of the sanctioning authority» But if it is to he re-interpreted, he considers that it shouia be along the lines indicated 0GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, MJSTANCE DEPARTMENT (CENTRAL REVENUES).

By order, etc., (Sd.) C. N. CHACKRABURTY, . Assistant Secretary to the Government of India.' MUlFinD—3,716—10-8-29—GIPSExtract paragraphs 6 to 8 of Secretary of State's Despatch No. 17-Military, dated the 15th May 1924. 6. Officers' dependants' pensions. —When the circumstances of the case other wise allow of the award of a pension to an officers' parents, brothers or sisters, such award is still subject to the proviso that the dependant is in pecuniary need and was largely dependent on the officer at the time of his death. Where these conditions are fulfilled the Regulations at present provide that pension shall be on a flat-rate scale, varying only in accordance with rank. The amount of pension to be awarded is within the discretion of the awarding department, subject to the rates laid down in the present Regulations for the different ranks not being exceeded. Within these limits the amount of the pension to be awarded will be determined as under. (a) Parents. (i) The means scale for officers' parents will be :— 200L per annum for one parent, plus 401. for a second parent, plus 40L for the first child, plus 301. for the second child, plus 25l. for the third and each subsequent child. (ii) Child shall be defined as in the case of officers' children above. {Hi) Where the income of the parent or parents and that of the children (if any) plus the contribution made by the deceased son did not exceed the appropriate means scale, the amount of the pension shall be the amount of the deceased son's contribution during his lifetime, provided such contribution was not less than 20 per cent, of the parent's income from all other sources, including the children's income, if any. (iv) W T here the total income was in excess of the appropriate means scale solely by reason of the deceased son's contribution, then, provided that such contribution was at least 20 per cent, of the income of the parent or parents from all other sources, including the income of the children (if any), the amount of the pension shall be the amount required to make up the parent's total income, as abive defined, to the means scale, plus half the balance of the deceased son's contribution. (■?;) Where the parent's income from all sources, other than the son's contri bution, is above but not more than twice the appropriate means scale, and where the deceased son contributed in addition an amount not less than 33| per cent, of such income, the amount of the pension shall be one-half of the deceased son's con tribution, less one-half of the amount by which the parent's income from all sources other than the son's contribution exceeds the means scale. (vi) Where the parent's income from all sources, other than the deceased son's contribution, is more than twice the appropriate means scale, no pension will be payable. (vii) Where the pension permissible under these regulations would be less than I5l. per annum, no award will be made. (viii) When the parent is over 65, the maximum pension payable will be in creased, following the intention of the present Regulations, by 50 per cent, and the means scale will be modified correspondingly. With reference to the increase of pension allowable when a parent reaches age 65 and is seriously incapacitated by ill-health, the general practice of the awarding departments will be to calculate the pension in accordance with the ordinary working rules and to increase the amount so arrived at by half. {b) Brothers and Sisters. The means limit for brothers and sisters of officers will be 1501. for the first brother (or sister), plus 50l. for each brother and sister after the first. In other respects Rules (ii) to (vi) will apply. Rule (vii) will be modified so as to make a minimum grant of 101. 7. Pensions to dependants of other ranks and ratings. —The same conditions attach to the award of these pensions as to the award of pensions to officers' dependants. As in those cases, the precise amount of the pension is to be deter mined at the discretion of the department, subject to the maximum laid down in the regulations.{a) Parents' Pensions. (i) The means scale for parents of other ranks will be : Where there is one parent, 205. personal income, or where there are two parents, 305. personal income plus the actual weekly contribution of the deceased son to his parents durinq his life time. J To calculate ' personal income ' the following deduction from the gross earnings of the family will be made in respect of children under 16: For the first child, 5s. ; For the second and subsequent children, 25. 6^., provided that not more than 125. 6^. in all shall be so deducted. (ii) No pensions will be payable unless the deceased son's contribution was at least 20 per cent, of the parent's or parents' income from all other sources. (m) No pension will be payable when the father (or stepfather) of the sailor soldier or airman is alive and earning normal wages. (iv) Subject to {ii) and [Hi) above, the amount of the pension will be, where the personal income of the parent or parents does not exceed the 205. or 305.. the amount of the deceased son's contribution. When it does exceed this figure, the pension shall be such lesser amount as is necessary to bring the parents' income from all sources up to the means scale. (v) The minimum pension will be 25. a week. (vi) With reference to the increase of pension allowable when a parent reaches age 60 or is seiiousl} incapacitated by ill-health, the general practice of the award ing ^ departments will be to calculate the pension afresh in accordance with the ordinary working rules and to increase the amount so arrived at by one-third, subject to the prescribed maximum of 125. 6^. a week for two parents. (b) Brothers'' and Sisters' Pensions. ^ (i) The means scale for brothers and sisters of other ranks and ratings will For the first brother or sister, 155., per week ; For the second brother or sister, 55. per week ; For the third brother or sister, 25., 6d. per week ; For the fourth brother or sister, 25. 6^. per week, plus the amount of the deceased brother's contribution per week. No additions would ordinarily be made to this scale in respect of other brothers and sisters. . W pension will be paid when the deceased brother's contribution to the maintenance of his brothers and sisters was less than one-sixth of the cost of such maintenance. (m) No pension will be paid in respect of the brother or sister of a deceased saiior, soldier or airman when such pension would bring the total payments made to the peison actually maintaining the children to a figure in excess of the means scale {iv) Subject to (|) and {in) above, the amount of the pension will be the amount oi the deceased brother's contribution or such lower rate as will bring the total payments being made on behalf of the child s maintenance up to the means scale. (v) The minimum pension will be 25. a week. 8. General—The above working rules will be accepted generally as a guide to those cases in which pension should or should not be awarded, and, subject always and without exception to the observance of the maximum rate of pension laid down in the regulations, as a guide to the amount of the pensions. The service departments will confer in any cases of difficulty which arise, and will retain their freedom to disregard the working rules in exceptional cases. It would be desirable that during the first year of the operation of the post-war scheme all cases should, if possible, be considered jointly, before an award is made. The rules will involve investigation of the applicants' means by officers of the Ministry of Pensions.FORM B. m This Form is to be completed and returned as soon as possible to the sanctioning authority.

In continuation of this Department letter No. F .-5 -XIV-R.II /31, dated the 1st September 1931, on the subject noted above, I am directed to communicate the following amendments, made in 1926, in the War Office ' working rules ' which were circulated with this Department letter No. F .-17 -XIII-R. 11/29, dated the 9th August 1929 :— (i) Paragraph 6(a) (viii). Parents. —In line 4/or ' and ' substitute ' or'. (ii) Paragraph 6(h). Brothers and sisters.—For ' £150 for the first ' substitute ' £75 for each '. (Hi) Paragraph 7(a) (Hi). Parents' pensions.—After 1 earning ' insert ' or capable of earning ', and after ' wages ' add 1 at the time of the son's death '. 2. I am also to enclose three forms marked A, B and C respectively for use in connection with awards under the post-War scheme. The first two should be subs tituted for the forms sent with this Department letter No. F. -17 -Xni -R .il /29 of the 9th August 1929. Such awards are to be reviewed annually in the fight of a return of income which should be obtained from the pensioner in the third form (form C) which should be sent to the pensioner in March of each year to be returned not later than the 30th September following, and the rate of pension admissible as from the 1st October following will be determined by the amount of the pensioner's actual income during the immediately preceding financial year. Pending the issue of such orders continuing or modifying the rate of pension, provisional payment will continue to be made as from the 1st October at the old rate subject to adjust ment. Should it be considered on review that the facts and probabilities in any individual case justify the permanent fixation of the award, a recommendation to that effect may be made to the Government of India. 3. The forms sent with this Department letter No. F .-288-C.S.R./27, dated the 9th September 1927, are to be used only in connection with dependants' cases arising out of the Great War. 4. I am to add that the instructions conveyed in paragraph 2 of this Depart ment letter of the 1st September 1931 apply also to payments of extraordinary S ir,pensions made in India; that is, the responsible accounts officers should fee informed of the basis and conditions of each award.

(2) The pension shall be of such amount as the Minister may determine, but in the case of parents of mariners of officer status shall not exceed £50 a year for one parent (£45 a year if the mariner held naval status equivalent to Warrant Officer) or £60 a year for two parents, and in other cases shall not exceed 10s. a week for one parent or 12s. 6d. a week for two parents; provided that in exceptional cases pension may be increased in excess of these maxima by a sum not exceeding £10 a year in respect of mariners of officer status and not exceeding 5s. a week in any other case. No pension shall be granted of less than £15 a year in the case of parents ' of mariners of officer status or of less than 5s, a week in other cases.(3) On the death of one of two parents any pension awarded under paragraph (1) above may be transferred, wholly or in part, to the surviving parent, if eligible, as from the date of application, unless otherwise deter mined by the Minister. (4) A pension granted to a widowed mother shall cease on her re-marriage. 71.—(1) Where no pension or allowance has been awarded under any of the above Articles of this Part of these Regulations in respect of a mariner of the female sex who has died in the circumstances set forth in Article 67, pensions may be awarded to her juvenile brothers and sisters, provided are in pecuniary need and were dependent on her within the meaning Article 2 (7). (2) The rate of any pension awarded under this Article shall be at the discretion of the Minister, but shall not exceed :— (a) in the case of mariners of officer status, £24 a year for one brother or sister (£18 a year if the mariner held naval status equivalent to Warrant Officer) or a total of £48 a year (£36 a year if the mariner held naval status equivalent to Warrant Officer) if there are more than one; {b) in other cases, 5s. a week for one brother or sister, or a total of 10s. a week if there are more than one. (3) Pensions granted under this Article shall terminate normally at age 18 in the case of the brothers and sisters of mariners of officer status, and at age 16 in other cases, but may be granted after, or continued beyond, those ages in the case of a brother or sister who is incapable of self-support by reason of infirmity, the infirmity having arisen before the normal age limit was reached, provided that:— (i) any other award under this Article is withdrawn, and (ii) in the case of the brother or sister of a mariner not of officer status an award shall not be granted after, or continued beyond, age 21. (4) A pension granted to a juvenile sister shall cease on her marriage. 72. Pensions in respect of deceased mariners of the female sex provided under these Regulations shall not be claimed as a right, and no pension shall be granted or continued to a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, is unworthy of a grant from public funds, and it shall be in the discretionary power of the Minister to terminate or suspend, in whole or in part, or to restore, any pension that may have been granted, or to provide for its administration under such conditions as he may determine.

Forces, and Others, Disabled, and for the Families of such Persons deceased, in consequence of the Present War 1. The provisions for the grant of retired pay, pensions, allowances ar&gt;^ gratuities to members of the Naval, Military and Air Forces disabled, and to the widows, children and dependants of such members deceased, in consequence of the present war, are set out in the Order in Council of the 7th August, 1940, the Royal Warrant of the 29th June, 1940, and the Order by His Majesty of the 22nd October, 1940. In view of the further rise in the cost of living since those provisions took effect in June, 1940, it has been decided to review the rates of pensions, etc., payable under the Royal Warrant and Orders referred to. 2. The rates laid down in the Pension Instruments of 1940 reflected generally the increase in the cost of living since the outbreak of war and the method broadly applied was to adjust the Great War rates of 1919, which were based on a cost of living figure of 215, to the cost of living figure of 181 which, obtained in June, 1940. In the present adjustment the same general principle has been followed, the new rates being related to a cost of living figure of 200. 3. Corresponding adjustments will also be made in pensions under the War Pensions and Detention Allowances (Mercantile Marine, etc.) Scheme (S.R. &amp; O. 1941 No. 225), the War Pensions and Detention Allowances (Naval Auxiliary Personnel) Scheme (S.R. &amp; 0.1940 No. 174) and the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme (S.R. &amp; O. 1941 No. 226). 4. The new rates are set out below and will take effect as from the first pay day in February, 1942. A. PENSIONS, ETC., FOR MEN AND THEIR DEPENDANTS. Rates of 100% Disability Pension [Article 9). Rank.
