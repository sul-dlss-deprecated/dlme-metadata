William Bruce, Resident at Bushire, recounts an act of piracy committed by the people of Charrak [Bandar-e Charak] in 1814 and describes Stephen Watson Henshaw's success in recovering most of the plundered treasure. Bruce recounts his own (failed) attempt to recover the rest of the plundered property from Shaik Abdolla Bin Ahmed [Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah] in 1816. He goes on to write that for a long time the Persian ports resisted entering into terms with the pirates. He states that he does not believe that they would ever have done so if they had been properly supported by the Sheeraz [Shiraz] Government. Bruce concludes that without proper assistance, none of the Persian ports were able to cope against the force of Rasselkhyma [Ra's al-Khaymah].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x00001c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
