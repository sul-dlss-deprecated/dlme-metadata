Since then, Chaoncy has called attention to the fact that the Sultan is making inadequate use of woods-Ballard's services, c.f. my letter 432/8/50 of the 18th November, 1950 to Furlonge, and if he is the best person we can find for the post, I think, we need have little hesitation in advising him accordingly in order that if he wishes to accept the appointment he can inform the Sultan that he does not desire to renew his contract. The matter, however, is fairly urgent since, as you will see from the enclosure, his contract expires in February, if it has not expired already. Woods-Ballard has acquired some knowledge of Arabic though I doubt if as yet he is very fluent in the language. If it is proposed to consider ^oods-Baliard for the Kuwait appointment would you kindly let me know by telegram accordingly in order that I may suggest to him through Chauncy that he should delay renwwing his contract for as long as possible ? 2 . fhe ultan m^y well be annoyed if we pinch oods- Ballard for Kuwait and :nay not be willing to appoint another ritisli Foreign inister in his place, but the importance of the Kuwait appointment is so much greater that I do not think this need deter us. Xi. . o« j J.’.r , sq. , o • »■ . , Foreign Office, London, S,..l.COPY BRITISH RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. June 10th, 1930. PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL. Woods-Ballard, the Muscat Minister of Foreign Affairs is going home on two month’s leave and expects to arrive in the United Kingdom on the 9th June. His contract with the Sultan expires next February. He will, I gather, be willing to stay on a year or two longer and I regard it as almost certain that the Sultan will ask him tc do so. He is, however, rather anxious to obtain employment in a somev/hat more civilised and accessible spot. T :e also 1 inu.s that on the whole he has very lilt tie to do in Muscat and is given very little discretion and would prefer a job giving more scope for his abilities. I am not at all anxious to see him leave Muscat as we will undoubtedly have considerable difficulty in finding somebody to take his place. 1 know it is the Foreign Office policy in future to employ established officers as far as possible, but I should like to pu /at it on record that it any time you do have difficulty in finding suitable incumbents for the Bahrain or Kuwait Agencies I think Woods-Ballard would do excellently in either. He would also in my opinion fill the post of adviser at Kuwait admirably if the Ruler eventually asks for one. I am writing to you about him as he tells me that he will probably be asking you to give him an interview. Yours ever, Sd. W.R. HAY. G.H.
