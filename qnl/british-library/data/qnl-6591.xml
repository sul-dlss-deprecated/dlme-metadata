My own impression is, that the Turks are much more anxious to estaLlish their supremacy along the coast than to reinstate Ahdoollah. The establishment of the Turkish ascendancy may be a good thing, or it may be bad, but at all events it involves a departure on our part from our past policy in the Gulf.' * No further correspondence passed on the subject of the proceedings at Biddeh, Government apparently preferring, in the face of the explicit assurances of the Porte, to look upon the hoisting of the flag as the act of an unauthorized and irresponsible person. The landing by the Turks of troops at El Biddeh and their subsequent evacuation of the place are mentioned in paragraph 34. 27, Increase of the Turkish Naval Force in Persian Gulf.— In the Aden News-Report, dated 31st August, the fol lowing entry was observedf:— 'The Turkish Corvette Lebanon and the des patch boat IsJcenderia, under Commodore Arif Bey, arrived here on the 27 th, and left for the Persian Gulf on the 29th. The Commodore informed me that he commands the squadron on the station extending from Maculla to Bussorah.' The Assistant Political Resident, Bushire, telegraphed on the 15th September:— ' Turkish Commodore Arif Bey stated in Muscat that Turkish Squadron in Persian Gulf was to consist of 10 vessels. Name of vessels arrived at Bushire— Lebanon corvette, Iskcnderia mm- boat.' The Turks had already one corvette and three unarmed steamers in the Gulf, and notwithstanding their assurances that, in regard to the Nejd Expedition, no maritime operations were intended, and that the ships were merely to be transports^ The Resident at Aden had understood § from the Turkish Commodore that he was to call at Maculla and endeavour to induce the Chief of that place to accept and hoist Turkish colors. In 1868 the Government of India brought || to the notice of the Secretary of State the attempt of some Turkish officials to esta blish an influence there, and suggested that some representations might be made through Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, with a view to restrain subjects of the Porte from exercising undue mfluence or pressure on the Chief of Maculla, or threatening his independence. he Secretary of State replied, in his despatches No. 10 dated 1st October and 19* Noyemher IS 09 , that this had been on ^r ernment W( * e not informod » Page 179. t Page 204.

Representation addressed to Home Government regarding the above. —On receipt of the above inform ation regarding an increase to the naval strength of the Turks in the Gulf, the Government of India addressed the fol lowing representation to the Secretary of State on the subject:— ' For* this intellig-ence we were by no means prepared, seeing that the Turkish Government had assured Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople that no maritime operations in the Persian Gulf were contemplated, and that the vessels then employed in that Gulf were only intended as trans ports for the conveyance of Turkish troops to some point on the coast whence they could reach Nejd. ' Your Grace will readily comprehend the diffi culty which the continued presence of a Turkish naval force would throw in the way of our maintaining that position in the Persian Gulf which the British Government has, with the best results, come to occupy, and which it is, we are more than ever convinced, our true policy to uphold. Our reasons have been fully laid before Your Grace in the despatches marginallyf men tioned, to none of which have we yet been favoured with a reply; and in view of the many possible contingencies in the neighbouring parts of Asia, we conceive that at no time was the maintenance of our position in the Gulf of more material importance than at present to British interests, to the encouragement of trade, and to the preserva tion of the peace of the Indian Seas. It would be to us a matter of deep regret that so faithful an ally as Turkey, one for the very existence of whose power England has made such sacrifices, should be the first to take a step calculated to alter a state of thing's, the maintenance of which we consider important to the interests of our Indian Empire, and from which, both in a political and a commercial point of view, the Porte herself has gained, and would continue to gain, so much profit without any expense on her part. 'We would, therefore, earnestly impress on Her Majesty's Government the necessity of taking immediate measures to ascertain definitely what is the policy of the Porte with regard to the Persian Gulf, and whether it is their intention to consti tute it for the future one of their naval stations. If any such intentions have been formed by the Government of His Majesty the Sultan, it is, in our opinion, necessary that the objections which we have stated at considerable length in our previ ous despatches should be fully laid before them, and that no effort should be spared to induce them to abstain from a line of policy the adoption of which we could not contemplate with indifference, and which, we believe, would be injurious to the best interests of Turkey herself.' The following statement of the naval strength of the Porte was given to Colo nel Pelly by the Turkish Commodore in November 1871. Colonel Pelly wrote +;— ' The Turkish squadron now in the Gulf the Com modore enumerated as per margin. § He added that two more corvettes were under orders from 7 \■ i i ' h f 26 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. Constantinople for the Gulf. He mentioned that at Busreh docks and a powder magazine were being- constructed for the squadron.' The Political Agent at Muscat* in- * Page 301. formed Colonel Pelly in September 1871 e that he had been told by the Turkish Commodore that in addition to the Leba non and Skenderia several more vessels of war would be stationed in the Persian Gulf; the future strength of the squadron, said the Commodore, would be 10 vessels. A despatch f was addressed by the Govern ment of India to the Secretary of State urging the advisability of an enquiry through Her Majesty's Ambassador as to whether there was any truth in this state ment. 29. Movements of B itish vessels.— The Government of India was at first disinclined to send a vessel of war to the Gulf as suggested by Colonel Pelly in his telegram dated 11th April, J the reason being that— ' If § a vessel were present and the Turks were, without challenge on our part, to act against our views and wishes, this would be equivalent to an abandonment of our policy. Whereas, if no vessel be present, we are free to act as circumstances require whatever the Turks may do.' On the 28th April || the Bombay Gov ernment were asked what men of war were available for service in the Gulf. They replied— 'The gun-boats Clyde and Hvgh Rose in Gulf forte le{tthis 11th April for Aden. started for Muscat, 24th April. supposed to be at Muscat.' After news had arrived^ that the Kowait Chief was preparing to aid the expedition, and it appeared possible that complications might arise regarding Bah- rem, a telegram ** was despatched to the ■Naval Commander-in-Chief at Aden to send a vessel of war to Colonel Pelly at ® Forte with the Commander- m-Uuef had, however, left Aden for Zan zibar, and the Bombay Government were K ^ s™- , '' ,,en ' on ' Magpie been ordered from Muscat to Bushire to await instructions through Colonel Pelly.

J Page 90. Bombay Marine was there. They proposed also to send the Bullfinch as well as the Magpie to Bushire to await instructions there. These proposals were approved by the Government of India, and in the letter of the 17th May * giving general instruc tions to the Bombay Government with regard to the Expedition, the Government of India wrote :— ' His Excellency in Council understands that, while the Hugh Rose remains at Colonel Felly's disposal as a Residency Steamer, the Bullfinch and the Magpie have been ordered to Bushire to await instructions. His Excellency in Council would wish instructions to be sent to the Com manders of the Bullfinch and the Magpie, through Colonel Pelly, to cruise in the neighbourhood of Bahrein, Kateef, and the ports at which it is believed the Turkish troops will disembark, care fully to observe all that takes place at sea, and, as far as possible, obtain intellig-ence of what takes place on land, and report events through Colonel Pelly as often as may be convenient. Arrange ments should be made that both vessels be not ab sent from the coast at the same time; if one returns to Bushire to report, the other should remain on the coast to watch events. ' The Commanders of the vessels should be made fully aware of our relations with the Bahrein and the trucial Chiefs, and also with the assurances received from the Ottoman Porte; and should it appear to the Officers Commanding that these rela tions and assurances have been, or are about to be, evaded or violated by any party or parties, a special report of the circumstances should at once be made/' By telegram dated 30th May, t Colonel Pelly was directed to proceed to Bahrein in the Hugh Rose accompanied by the Magpie and Bullfinch. He replied on the 31st J :— ' Magpie, reported cruising after slavers to south ward of Muscat. Bullfinch left Muscat for Gulf, but returned Muscat with supposed slaver; was to start again; neither vessel since heard of. As before submitted, no vessel, naval or marine, at my disposal, since announcement of Turkish Expedition two months ago, until Hugh Rose arrived Sunday. Have despatched Assistant Resident in her to Bahrein with carefully prepared instructions. Will send required communications to Chiefs by Native craft. Am doing my best, and trust much to past influence, but protracted absence of vessels and communications Arab coast misinterpreted and liable to complicate matters.' On this the Government of India tele graphed to Commander Tucker at Trinco- malie:— ' Tell His Excellency [i.e., the Naval Com mander-in-Chief) that on 16 th May Viceroy ordered Bullfinch Bushire very special service. Ordered Magpie proceed thither quickly. Find impossible communicate Magpie. Last thing heard of Bullfinch was had gone back to Muscat with a slaver. Magpie said cruising south Muscat. Search slaver.

Colonel Pelly was asked if he could communicate with the Bullfinch.i He t Page 90. replied on 3rd June*:— J Page92. 'I telegraphed to Bullfinch and Magpie via Angaum, Gwadur, and Muscat. Bullfinch replied from Bassadore was leaving for Bahrein.' On the 8th June§ Colonel Pelly signalled § Page 93. that the Bullfinch had arrived at Bahrein on the 3rd, and that he purposed proceed ing in company with the Hugh Rose to Kateef. The Magpie was reported to be at Jask Page 93. on the 5th June and on the point of leav ing for the Gulf. The Lynx arrived at Angaum on the 16th July. ^4. From this time there appears to have been no difficulty regarding the vessel required for the Gulf. Before leaving Bahrein for Bushire Colonel Pe^v, on the 16111 December, requested ** the Senior « Bombay Goven^t letter No. 378. dated x\avai (Jmcer to have one vessel uninter- 20th January 1872, ruptedly present in Bahrein Harbour in order to watch events and afford moral support to the Chief. The instructions of Government with regard to the course to be pursued in the matter of the murder of the Turkish messenger were communicated to the Senior Naval Officer, who was also asked to let a vessel of war show itself off El Biddeh where the Turks were then about to land troops. Communication was to be kept up with the trucial Chiefs on the Pirate Coast. 30. Case Of the ' Snipe.'— Colonel Pelly on the 1st Julyff telegraphed that the ft Page 122 said by him to be a British ship, had arrived in Bushire roads, having on board some 20 Turkish troop. The Commander ot the Bullfinch, then at Bushire, presumed she would not be allowed to proceed. The Hon ble J. F. Stephen gave the following opinion on the case. He said ' T I ie Stl i keS me thus : The ^ carrying contraband of war for the Turks, This exposes ? t e ^ 8eTZUre ^ th t Arabs ' but 1 do not see how it authorizes a Bntish cruiser to interfere.

' No doubt the maritime truce puts us in a singular position in the Gulf; but surely Persia is not a party to it, nor does it extend so far north as Bushire. ' As at present advised, 1 think Pelly should be told to permit the Snipe to proceed, warning her Commander that he will not be protected if the Arabs attack him.' Government, accordingly, on the 2nd July, directed the Commander of the Bullfinch to allow the Snipe to proceed, but to warn the Master that he was liable to hostile seizure. On the same date the Ambassador at Constantinople was informed of what had occurred, and it was added :— ' It would be desirable that the Turkish Govern ment should abstain from employing British vessels in such a manner in the Gulf. Can a friendly remonstrance be made to that effect ?' Sir H. Elliot on the 6th replied :— ' Orders have been sent to Midhut Pasha to abstain as much as possible from employing British vessels for transport of Turkish troops destined for Nejd Expedition.' In a despatch of the same date to Lord Granville, Sir H. Elliot wrote :— ' I communicated * the substance of it' (i.e., the telegram from India) ' to Server Effendi, and pointed out that the employment of vessels bear ing the British flag in carrying troops engaged in an expedition of this nature would give rise to erroneous interpretation by the native tribes upon the coast, and that I should be glad if he could meet the wishes of Lord Mayo in the matter. 'His Excellency said that, without taking a positive engagement that British vessels should not be employed at all, if there should be a neces sity for it, he would desire that they should not be engaged for the conveyance of troops, if it could be avoided.' From a telegram of the 3rd July,t how ever, it appeared that the Snipe was not a British vessel. Colonel Herbert sig nalled J :— ' Ottoman Government has engaged Ship Snipe bearing British flag, said to be property of Hajee Jaber, Persian Governor of Mohamrah, for con veyance of correspondence and commissariat sup plies to Kateef, under contract to reach on 4th instant, having put into Bushire, she is reported as detained by Anglo-India authorities. Midhut Pasha requests she may be set at liberty. Please reply immediately.' Noting on the telegram the Foreign Secretary observed § ;— 'This telegram very much alters the aspect of the case. It appears she is not a British vessel, but belongs to one of the local Persian Governors, and unauthorizedly sails under the British flag. She is, therefore, liable to be forfeited to Her Majesty 8* Pages 174-175 under Sectiou 103 of 17 and IS Vie., Cap. 104. Colonel Herbert should, I think, be called upon to report specifically as to the nationality of the vessel; and if she turns out to be Persian, Mr. Alison should be moved to remonstrate and obtain orders forbidding the Governor of Mohamrah, or the owner, from flying* the British flag'. If she persists in flying it, she should be confiscated. The Hon'ble J. Stephen remarked*:— ' The Section referred to is very difficult to con strue, inasmuch as its terras would appear to autho rize the seizure by an English cruiser of a French ship which hoisted the English flag. I do not think that this can be the meaning of the Act. It must, I think, be supposed that the Act was meant to agree with the rules of international law, and by those rules nothing will justify the seizure of a foreign vessel, except some act (such as running a blockade, carrying contraband of war, or the like) which is an offence against international law. The mere assumption by a ship of one nation of the flag or national character of a different nation is not, so far as I know, an international offence which would by itself warrant seizure, and the municipal law of England would not extend, unless the very clearest intention to extend it was appa rent from its terms, to foreign ships. Of course Parliament could pass a law that every French ship which hoisted an English flag should be seized and forfeited; but to do so would be an act of war, and it cannot be supposed that it is the intention of the Merchant Shipping Act to authorize such an act. 1 think, therefore, that the section must be read thus:— ' 'If any person uses the British flag and assumes the British national character on board any ship subject to the law of England, owned in whole, or in part, by any persons not entitled by law to own British ships for the purpose of making such ship appear to be a British ship, shall be forfeited to Her Majesty.' ' The following considerations favor this view :— Section 18 provides that f no ship shall be deemed a British ship' unless she belongs wholly to natural born British subjects or denizens. In a wider sense, a ship owned by persons owing a tem- porajy allegiance to the Queen as residents in England, either in whole or in part, would be a British ship, and, as such, would be liable to hostile capture. There is, therefore, a class of Sips to which the section would apply, viz., British ships in the more general sense of the words, as opposed to British ships as defined by 'In Phillimore's International Law, Vol. IV nf ^ is . of fthose sec tions of the Merchant Shipping Act which bear in any degm. upon questions of Maritime International 527 atd ws 'if- 'i! '1 mentioI1 « 1 . but Sections ' and 5 28 . wh 'ch authonze the arrest of foreien Tho^Te f r Certain Circumstance8 . are referred to. sections are in part as follows' When b^n ^ ^ P art o£ ^ Keen cansed to any property by any foreig-n shin if at any time thereafter such ship is found in anv ^1',™ 0f L the United Kingdom or within three miles of the coast thereof, the ship may be NEJD EXPEDITION PEEC1S.NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. detained. When foreign ships are referred to, care is taken to name them expressly, and to confine the power of dealing with them to the case of their being within the Queen's jurisdiction. 5 ' Again, the section in question (103) exempts the ships referred to from seizure if they hoist the British flag ' for the purpose of escaping capture by an enemy or by a foreign ship of war in the exercise of some belligerent right/ ' A ship would hardly wish to hoist the British flag (except as a stratagem, which I do not think is the case intended) unless it was in some sense a British ship—a British ship, that is, as against foreigners, though not within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act. ' Finally, Part II. of the Act applies, by Sec tion 17, to Hhe whole of Her Majesty's domi nions/ Neither Bushire nor the shore of the Persian Gulf, nor the High Seas are part of Her Majesty's dominions. I think, therefore, that, even if the Section applied t@ the Snipe, she ought not to be seized out of Her Majesty's dominions.' Colonel Herbert ascertained that the Snipe was a registered British vessel belonging to Messrs. David Sassoon &amp; Co. of Bombay. That firm, on being asked for information with regard to the vessel, replied:— 'We have to state that the Snipe was purchased in London by our firm there, on account of Hajee Zenail Abadeen, a naturalized British subject, in accordance with his instructions. Our firm regis tered the steamer in our name, and valued for the cost in bills in our favour, with instructions, when the bills are paid, to transfer the Snipe to his name. Hajee Zenail Abadeen paid us the cost of the steamer by instalments up to November 1870, and on the 22nd of the same month we made the bill of sale in his name, immediately after which the Snipe sailed from Bombay, and returned only last month. We, therefore, had no opportunity till now to get the register made out in his name, which, however, has now been done.' The Commander of the vessel deposed :— ' The steamer is now registered in the name of Ruben David Sassoon, of London; a Power of Attorney is held by the firm in Bombay. In October or November last she was transferred by bill of sale to Hajee Zenail Abadeen, British subject of Bombay. Declaration of ownership was lodged by me at the time in the Master Attendant's Office, Bombay. I was going to sea at once, and I was informed by the Master Atten dant that, as there was a probability of the ship being sold to some Persians, all that would be necessary, after the money was paid, would be for the register to be handed in, when it would be cancelled. ' In the meantime the negociations with the Persians fell through, and I am now authorized by the owner, Hajee Zenail Abadeen, to take out a new register. During the whole of my absence I have looked upon him as my owner. I have remitted as much as Rupees 20,000 or Rupees 25,000 to him when coaling at Aden, and for stores at Kurrachee I drew upon him.'NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. The Bombay Government, in a Resolu tion dated 27th July, observed* :— 'It would appear that the owner of the S. S. Snipe is a British subject. There have been negociations for the sale to Persian subjects, and apparently in anticipation of these negociations being perfected, it was proposed to register the vessel in the names of the proposed transferees, which Captain Pryce refused to permit, as the sale was not complete and the persons named were foreigners.^ In a letter of the 29th December 1871 Colonel Pelly incidentally mentions that he has been informed that the Turkish authorities have purchased the Snipe. 31. Murder of a so-called Turkish Messenger at Bahrein— On the 12th September Colonel Pelly forwarded certain papers regarding the seizure and death of an Arab of the Beni Hajjir tribe at a fish ing village called Ageria on the south west end of the Bahrein Island. He had - already informed Government of the occur rence by a telegram dated 1st September:— ' The t several accounts of the matter,' said Colonel Pelly in his letter, ' are not altogether consistent one with another. But 1 gather generally that assir bin Mobarek, the escaped pirate of 1869, sought service with, or the patronage of, the Turk ish Commander at Lahsa; that he was more or less received into favour by the Commander : that eventually Nassir bin Mobarek, wishing to commu nicate with Gwuttur, selected a messenger from that tribe to which he (Nassir) himself belonged on his .mothers side, viz., the Beni Hajjir; that this . messenger was accordingly charged with letters by ir and proceeded to Ojair; that at Oiair the messenger embarked on board a Kowait boat in company with a fleet of Bahrein boats which were returning home; that wanting water, or for other fleet ''nut ^ tog,ether with the Bahrein eet put into Agena on the Bahrein coast; that while there anchored, it came to the knowledge of ^ 0r 0f the relati ves of the late Chfef of Bahrein, Ah bm Khuleefa, that the messenger was the late Ch'T ^ killed 0r aided in killin 8- the late Chief in the piratical attack of 1869 • that m accordance with Arab laws of vengeance' (and as the present Chief asserts, without In the first instance referring to him) the relatives of the late clothes'of th ^ d the messen ^ that the lotties ot the messenger were then searched and found to contain letters addressed as follows : _ binfsa'e! ereCk to Jae8im ^ Mahomed ^From Nassir bin Mobarek to ditto ditto, „ J 0 ' 1 the SOn of ditto to ditt « ditto. 11 « p 0111 f* h0med bin Feysul ^ ditto.

'The Chief of Bahrein subsequently enclosed the letters taken from the messenger's corpse for my perusal, in original. 1 returned these letters to the Chief with a note, of which a copy is appended.' On the 15tli October Colonel Herbert telegraphed;— ' Pasha* privately asks my opinion. A messenger from Turkish General at Lahsa with letters from Gvvuttur visited Bahrein. Sheikh heard of, seized, and killed him. British officers hearing this demanded letters and forwarded them to Gwuttur. Pasha cordially acknowledges obligation. He wishes to obtain fitting reparation from Sheikh, but considers to apply officially to British Govern ment would be yielding a point as to political position of island. Under existing circumstances, and promises recently given, he cannot use force against Sheikh as an Ottoman dependent, conse quently contemplates sending a Commission to demand reparation. I request orders.' Colonel Herbert was informed on the 17th idem of Colonel Felly's version of the story and directed, if possible, to avoid dis cussion with the Pasha until further en quiry could be made ; only if pressed, was he to tell the other version. On the 24th October Colonel Herbert informed Govern- mentf :— ' Midhut Pasha expects to leave Thursday, and it is probable he will make the death of the messen ger a pretext for interference at Bahrein if he receive from me no satisfactory communication before he goes.' Colonel Pelly was directed to proceed to Bahrein or send his Assistant there, and the following reply was sent to Colonel Her bert by telegraph of the 30th * ; (&lt; Viceroy cannot suppose that Pasha, knowing views of British Government regarding Bahrein, and explicit denial of Ottoman Government of all intention to extend supremacy over Bahrein, and remembering assurances given by Pasha himselt, can entertain any intention of interfering with that island. Viceroy would consider such to be a violation of instructions believed to have been given Pasha from Constantinople, and of the promises given by his Government, and would not look on interference with indifference. ' Use your discretion as to expressing above views to Pasha. Inform him of Pell/s version of story.' The Pasha § had, however, left Bagdad for Bussorah en voute to Nejd when the tele- oram reached, and Colonel Herbert consi dered that it would be inconvenient to make the communication through a third party. He subsequently, however, re quested || the Agent at Bussorah to wait 9NEJD EXPEDITION PKECIS. upon the Paslia on arrival and communi cate the substance of the above message. The Bombay Government, on the 5th November, telegraphed*:— 'Telly telegraphs for instructions whether action is limited to watching- events. In my opinion, if, after all our representations at Constantinople and assurances at Bahrein, we content ourselves with watching events, our position in Gulf will be in future untenable. If force sufficient, I would not hesitate to instruct Pel/y to prevent any Turkish occupation, and am confident that if this were known, not a blow would be struck. But some of the Turkish corvettes are of modern construc tion and heavy armament, and I do not know what Lynx and Magpie carry. In this case I should direct Pelly to visit Midhut Pasha on arrival, learn his intentions, and, stating circum stances which excuse Bahrein Chief, offer good offices; if refused, hand him formal protest with memorandum for transmission to London and in Constantinople to the effect that Turkish Com mander from commencement of operations em ployed and took into confidence Nassir bin Mo- barek, who instigated and laid revolution in which Chiefs father was assassinated. The present Cmet having been placed on throne by our inter vention, and Nassir compelled to fly, it was in consistent with friendly relations with this country to employ and protect a man who had fled from punishment at our hand; that Nassir having employed the man who murdered Chiefs father to carry letters to tribes with whom we have treated messenger had no claim to protection as an Envoy from private person, and has justly met punish- ment of crime.

The Secretary of 20th November* :— State replied on the ' Turkish proceedings in Gulf. Telegrams of 9th and 10th received. Foreign Office have com municated with Turkish Government. Answer from Elliot is as follows:—November 14th. I have reminded the Porte of the assurance given by ali Pasha that no intention was entertained of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, or of subduing the independent tribes of Southern Arabia. Server Pasha has repeated these assurances, but says that Chief of Bahrein, having caused a messenger of the Turkish General to be waylaid and murdered on the mainland, reparation will have to be obtained from him. Telegram ends. British Government consider the Porte entitled to some reparation for murder of messenger. Better that this should be obtained by our means than by Turkish force. If necessary, send Pelly to settle matters on the spot.' He was informed in reply on the 23rdt:— 'Ottoman Porte appear in error, messenger not murdered on mainland, but on island of Bahrein, and said not to have borne any credentials by which he could be distinguished as messenger of Turkish General.' The Secretary of State on the 27th November directed that Colonel Pelly should be sent to Bahrein to ascertain whether any and what reparation was due to the Turkish authorities. Colonel Pelly, who was already at Bahrein, was informed on the 30th November of the orders of the Secretary of State, and he was desired to have drawn up and signed by the Bahrein Chief a full statement of the fact regarding the murder of the messenger; he was also ordered! :— ' Inform Turkish officers that the murder case is one that can only be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy and, if necessary, by arbitration, and cannot affect in any way the political status of Bahrein. Order of November 8th to be adhered to.' The Turkish Commodore with a corvette and gun-boat arrived at Bahrein § on the 22nd November, and it appeared to have been the intention of the Pasha at that time to go himself to Bahrein and raisethe question of the murder. The Govern ment instructions of the 30th were antici pated by Colonel Pelly, who on the 29t i ^ ^ November* signalled: « Turkish Commodore having opened question of messenger with Bahrein Chief, Chief has addressed letter to Midhut Pasha for submission to^ Forte, giving true version of messenger's death.

Colonel Pelly wrote { :— + P:, ^ es ' I think it is gravely to be regretted that a Turkish authority writing from the Wahabee territory should have selected a person of Nassir bin Mobarek's antecedents to arrange for the transmission of the letter; and I further think that, in putting into a Bahrein port, the messenger challenged the chance of a retaliation which all Arab tribes habitually practice. 'It is in my opinion to be further borne in mind that it does not appear that any intimation had ever been made to the Chief of Bahrein of the occupation of Lahsa and Ojair by Turkish authority. ' From all that I have heard and seen of the Bahrein Chief, I am persuaded that, to the best of his knowledge and ability, he is most anxious not only to observe a strict neutrality in reference to the Turkish Wahabee contest, but is striving by every means to avoid any misunderstanding which might tend to enable others to fix a quarrel on him.' The letter from the Chief to Midhut Pasha was as followS§ :— § Pages 387 -388. 'A few days ago the Turkish Commodore anchored in the harbour of Bahrein, and I deputed my brother, Sheikh Ahmed, to proceed on board and welcome him. ' during the visit the Commodore, it appears referred to the death of a man of the Beni Haiii^ tribe, which occurred on this island some months ago, and stated it was the intention of Your Excel lency to visit Bahrein in view to enquiring into this matter, as the man was a messenger sent by the Turkish authorities at Lahsa. nejd expedition precis.NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 37 ' Although myself at the time extremely vexed at the circumstances which led to, and were connec ted with, the death of the Beni Hajjir tribesman, I refrained from troubling Your Excellency, or the Exalted Government at Constantinople, on the subject. ' After the remarks of the Commodore, however, to the effect that the messenger was a Turkish Government servant, it seems on all accounts proper that I should address Your Excellency. ' The facts of the case there were as follows :— ' 1^.—About two years ago Nassir bin Moba- rek, with a following of the Beni Hajjir tribe and others, embarked from the Kateef and Ojair «oast, landed at Bahrein, pirated the island, murdered my late father, Ali bin Khuleefa, the then Chief of Bahrein. ' 2nd. —About three months ago a man arrived from Ojair at a village on the southern end of Bahrein and was recognized by some of the Bah- reinees as a tribesman of the Beni Hajjir, related to Nassir bin Mobarek, and who had been concerned in the proceedings which resulted in the murder of my late father. These Bahreinees thereupon followed the custom which everywhere obtains among the Bedouins when at blood feud, and killed the man. ' 3rd. —The tribesman's corpse was subsequently searched, and some letters or other documents were found on it, and were brought to me with a report of the cause and circumstances of the man's death. Among these documents were two at least, which I beg to particularize, viz., one which there was reason to suppose came from a Turkish subject; and, secondly, one which inti mated to its addressee that f the news is such as you would wish, and the Exalted Government are trying for Bahrein, Gwuttur, and other places to the detriment of the enemy and to the rejoicing of friends. You will shortly receive news which will gladden you.' ' As regards the letter from the Turkish subject, I preserved it unopened, showed its envelope to the British officers then at Bahrein, and with their approval transmitted it unopened by the same boat in which it arrived to its addressee. ' As regards the second letter (namely that threatening my island with capture by the Turkish Government), I perused it with equal astonish ment and alarm. ' Such briefly being the circumstances of the case, and being now given to understand that the Beni Hajjir tribesman was a messenger of the Turkish authorities at Lahsa, I beg to express my sincere regret that a servant of the Exalted Govern ment should have been killed within my territory, and also to add an expression of my regret: '\st. —That no intimation should have been made to me by the Turkish authorities at Lahsa of that district having passed under the direct rule of the Sublime Porte. ' 2^/.—That when selecting a messenger who might have to visit Bahrein, the authorities at Lahsa should have selected a man of a tribe known to be at blood feud with the Bahreinees, and a family connection of Nassir bin Mobarek, noto- 10t Pa^'e 392 + I'a^e 392 * Page 385 rious for having caused the untimely death o£ the late Chief of Bahrein. « 3^.—That the messenger should have carried no credential or passport whereby he might have been recognized as a servant of \our Excellency &gt; Government.

'1 beg the favour of Your Excellency's causing, at Your Excellency's convenience, the above ex planation and remarks to be communicated to the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan.' With regard to the above letter, Colonel Pelly wrote*:— ' The English version of the letter of the Chief of Bahrein is now enclosed, and I respectfully soli cit a caref ul perusal of it, for it appears to me that while this document exculpates the Chief of Bah rein from any intentional insult or annoyance to Turkish authority, it leaves on the local Turkish authorities at Lahsa the responsibility of having selected as their official messenger a tribesman concerned, directly or indirectly, in the murder of the late Chief of Bahrein, and of having permitted this messenger to proceed to Bahrein unaccredited, and carrying on his person a letter, evidencing the wish of the Turkish Government to capture Bah rein; the time and circumstances of the trans mission seem to add to the weight of the above responsibilities.' In a letter dated 17th January, the Government of India expressed their entire approval of the proceedings of Colonel Pelly in the matter, and commended the prudence and sagacity displayed by him throughout the difficult business. On the 5th January Colonel Pelly tele graphed to Bombay Governmentf :— ' Bahrein Chief hae sent me reply of Bagdad Pasha to his letter. Chief anxious to rely on my advice m the matter.

Under cover of his letter No. ff, dated 13th January 1872, Colonel Pelly enclosed40 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. the translated purport of Midhut 1'asha s reply to the Bahrein Chief. It was as follows:— p. , , aut Ra mzan 12 88 rece i ve( J at Bushire on 4th .January 1872. ^ 4th December 1871' Translated purport of a letter from His E xcellency M idhi i T P.8H ?Zlrnor-Generalof Erak and Nejd and Conuuar.der- Chief of the 6th Division ot the Amy, to hHEik Wi i. Ali , Chief of Bahrein. 'I received , while at Lahsa, your letter dated Ramzan, written at a time when the most respect ed Arif Bey, Chief of the Coasts under the jurisdiction of the Government of Busreh and that of the Peninsula of Arabia, visited Bahrein with several of the vessels of the Sultan s Govern ment, explaining the circumstances attending the murder of the messenger, and have noted what you have therein set fort. ' The importance of this subject demands a clear explanation, and renders it necessary that I should send you an explicit reply to your statements and the details connected therewith. ' This murdered messenger, who was of the tribe of the Beni Hajjir and a dependent of the Turkish Government, had been engaged by the Commander-in-Chief in Nejd, Nafid Pasha, and was especially deputed to convey official letters to the Kayem * Mukam of Guttur, Jassem bin Sani. He was proceeding in a boat, but from stress of weather approached the island of Bahrein, where he was seized, his letters taken from him and himself killed. ' In your letter, after acknowledging the fact of the occurrence of the murder, you mention the reasons for the perpetration of this act to be— 'Firstly, that two years ago, Nassir bin Mo- barek attacked Bahrein and killed your father, and that he had with him the Beni Hajjir tribe. ' Secondly, you allege that the messenger aforesaid, on his arrival at Bahrein, three months previous, declared he was one of the Keni Hajjir who accompanied Nassir bin Mobarek to Bahrein, and was one of those who killed your father, and that the people on the south end of the island on ascertaining this killed him in accordance with the custom of the Bedouins. Deputy Governor. ' Taking it for granted that when Nassir bin Mobarek went to Bahrein he accompanied those people who ventured to commit the acts in which the Beni Hajjir were implicated, and taking it for granted also that the murdered messenger was also among the tribe, it is impossible for one to con ceive that the messenger proceeding on service should assert that he was at such a time with the tribe who committed the hostile acts, and was one of the murderers, or confess to what may cause retaliatory measures against himself. This is sufficient to show the falsity of the statement. ' Apart from the above consideration we must bear in mind that this messenger was entrusted with documents from one governmental authority to another, and allowing that Bahrein was not a part of the Turkish dominions, and that the people ot that island were not under Turkish jurisdiction or dependents of that Government, and that this man was really a murderer: so long as he was a dependent of the Government and the bearer of11 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS, 41 important documents, it would have been in the first place necessary to permit him to convey his letters to their destination, and afterwards to com municate with the Turkish Government authori- ties in regard to the accused, and punishment demanded, when, in accordance with the require ments of justice, the accused, if convicted, would have received due punishment. But if without any just cause this person is murdered in the manner stated, and afterwards it is explained that he was with the tribe who came to Bahrein and committed outrages, plunder, and murder, such a proceeding is in the highest degree absurd, contrary to justice, and a deviation from the right course. ' For example, if one or more of the people of Bahrein who frequent the coasts of Busreh, Kowait, Kateef, Ojair, and Gwuttur be murdered by the Arabs of those parts, and explanation be required, it were to be said that the person or persons murdered were of a tribe who at a certain time visited and plundered such a place, and were related to those who murdered our messenger, and such like excuses made, I would like to know whether such pleas would be accepted. ' If both parties concerned are dependents of one and the same Government, the party who ventures to commit such an act will be considered as a murderer, and would be required to undergo punish ment, or, even supposing one of the parties to be a foreigner, would not this course be applicable to him ? Certainly it would be so. The above sufficiently answers the first and second excuses put forward in your letter. ' The arguments adduced by me in this matter would be recognized in every place, and are in accordance with all custom and rule, and in every Court in the world. 'But as regards the third subject mooted in your letter, to the effect that|the murdered messenger was the bearer of a letter from the Firman Firm a for Jassim bin Sani, and that you sent the letter intact with the seal unbroken to its destination, you say also that in opening a second letter you found that certain persons had written it to another person in Gwuttur, mentioning certain matters connected with Bahrein, which you observed with regret. This letter, although written by certain persons to an individual in Gwuttur, did not contain matters of the nature represented by you. But if it had contained any such, may God help us, it would have created mischief to the State. ' This question had no concern with the messen ger, nor yet with the person to whom the messen ger was sent, but had reference only to the persons who indited the letter. Notwithstanding this were the subject-matter contained in the letter as seen by you and quoted by you to this effect, viz.— ' That the enemy would be suppressed, and that friends would rejoice,' it contained nothing injuri ous, but only what was beneficial to all mankind, ' If any fault can be found, it is in the fact of your having opened a letter of this description from one party to another, at a time when you were a person in authority. Your presumption in acting in this manner would be objected to by every Government and stigmatized by every creed.NEJD EXPEDITION PIIECIS. ' As regards your statement that the messenger who bore these letters was not known and earned no passport, the idea of sneh a question as that ot messengers proceeding from Lahsa to (jrwuttui being known or unknown, competent or otherwise, for the first time emanates from Bahrein. It is well known that persons employed on the coast and passing to and fro do not carry passports, and that the custom of carrying passports has never been in vogue in these parts. ' What you have now put forward in argument is sometimes considered fitting to adduce as an excuse, under such circumstances, in great cities which you have not seen, but may have heard of. ' The excuse, however, had no effect, because it is not the practice to carry passports in these parts. It would appear you have written from hearsay without considering at all whether the excuse would be of any service to you or have any weight whatever, 'Notwithstanding this it was known from the address of the official letter which the messenger was carrying, and from the seal on the document whence the messenger had come, and whither he was proceeding, and on what business he was de puted. These cirrcumstances naturally showed what the man's business was. Your statements are consequently foolish, and call for no remark. ' What causes me more suprise than all else in your statement, that you were not aware of the arri val of the Imperial troops at Lahsa and Kateef, while arrival of these troops took place more than six months ago and the people of Bahrein, consequent on the protection and security caused by the presence of the troops, frequented the coasts with out interference and carried on trade. The steamers and other vessels also passed to and fro in the vicinity of Bahrein. I am unable to understand how these patent circumstances have escaped your observation, while I have heard so much of your good sense and intelligence. 'In conclusion, the man despatched for the delivery of important letters from one Turkish Government authority to another is well known to us of having left; also how he was made to deviate from his course, the way in which he was taken to the island of Bahrein, and by whose hands he was killed. Some portions of the actual facts remained incomplete, but these were ascertained during the mission of Arif Bey, and the evidence is now complete. ' On this account it is necessary that the mur derers should be called on to pay the blood-money of the murdered in accordance with the custom of law, viz., 10,000 legal dirhems of pure silver, which amount should be made over to the Kayem Mukam in Gwuttur, Jassim bin Sani, for payment to the heirs of the murdered. , ' 1 I , n . an y . cas 1 e 'tis required that the murderer W ™ ft 00 ° fined - If 14 were tor me (to get th ls done), it would have been done, iwt'he repeated ^ ^ 38 are' ^ info ™ e &lt; 1 wt io the murderers art, and m wllat manner they ^ ^ eonfinc(1 into e 'T 88 Wh ; Ch 1 havt ' ^ are not carried into effect, and as you have written that the murder•■■ v v /-v ;, v ' •' ■; v;. , .,.1 ; • ■ &lt;.iy ■ ' i -I • Hi ..if l&gt; i. •' {■ I'l I- b • , ;• ■■ ;; ■ :■ ■ ' . - r 1 '- I NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 43 * Vide enclosure to Bombay Govornmeut letter, No. 378, dated 20th January 1872. f Enclosure to Bombay Government No. 1009, dated 19th February 1872. was committed by the people of the south, I, by the power of His Imperial Majesty, am able really and actually to give effect to what I have said. ' I now await a decisive reply from you.' On leaving Bahrein for Busliire, Colonel Pelly gave the following instructions, dated 16th December, * to Captain Grant, Assis tant Resident, who was left behind at Bah rein, in case the question of the murder of the messenger should be revived. After informing him of the instructions of the Government of India, he added— ' I now entertain every hope that the Turkish authorities will not interfere with Bahrein. ' Should interference, however, have place [and as providing for this remote possibility], you will in such event remind the Senior Turkish Officer present, verbally in the first instance, and, if neces sary, by letter, of the assurance given by the Porte to our Government. ' If the interference should still continue, address to the Senior Turkish Officer the language of His Excellency the Viceroy contained in the telegram of the Political Secretary, dated 9th November last. ' Should the interference relate to the death of the messenger in particular, say you are instructed to intimate that this is a matter for diplomacy and, if necessary, for arbitration, and cannot in any way affect the political status of Bahrein. ' Your letter should go by direction, beginning thus : The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting in obedience to commands received from His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General of India instructs me to &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. ' In the event of interference communicate with me by steamer if there be more than one steamer at Bahrein, otherwise by special boat. * * * 'It is possible that His Excellency Midhut Pasha may write to the Chief of Bahrein concern ing the messenger and other matters, in such event, please verbally suggest to the Chief the advisability of sending a copy of the Pasha's letter to me, and of his postponing reply until he hears from me.' Colonel Pelly in a letter dated 27tli January, to the Bombay Government,! for warded a draft of the reply which he had recommended the Chief of Bahrein to address to the Pasha, and which the Chief approved and despatched immediately. The draft after acknowledging receipt of the Pasha's letter concluded— ' I have submitted a copy of your letter to the British Government, with the request that, in com munication with the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan at Constantinople, an amicable settlement will be arrived at, and that I will bind myself to accept such settlement of the claims pending between Nejd and Bahrein.' The Assistant Besident, now at Bahrein, has been desired by Colonel Pelly to com municate with him on the slightest symp tom of the Turks using force.u NEJD EXPEDITrON PRECIS 32. Demand on Bahrein Chief toi surrender of two boats. —v\ hill 1 cor respondence regarding the murder of the Turkish messenger was still being carried on, the Turks found a new pretext for tix- ing a quarrel on the Chief of Bahrein regarding two boats which the Pasha pre tended to have been irregularly obtained by the Bahrein Chief from Kateef:— 'These craft/' wrote* Colonel Pelly, 'were, I bo- * ^ Bombay Government No. 637. dated :Ust lieve, brought over to Bahrein by Saoodbin l^eysul d.ntu.iry 1 before the commencement of the Turkish Expedi tion, and were presented by Saood to a certain person or persons in Bahrein/' Colonel Felly forwarded translated pur port of the letter from Midhut Pasha, demanding surrender of these boats. It was as follows:— 'I have just received a petition from Mahomed bin Hossein of Gwuttur to effect that Saood bin Feysul, when fighting (for supremacy) with his brother Abdoollah, seized forcibly his boats. These boats are now in possession of the people of Bahrein, and petitioner begs the restoration of these boats to him. ' I beg to inform you that these acts of plunder are contrary to law and to the customs of the high Government. You know that the wish of the Government is to protect its subjects and to pre serve them from intrigue and oppression, special 1} as Saood has seized all boats by force, and whatever he has thus taken forcibly is in possession of the people of Bahrein who have become protectors of what this oppressor has plundered. Under these circumstances, such proceedings are contrary to the rules of civilization and opposed to the customs of the Exalted Government. ' I find it necessary to request you to ascertain who possesses the boats of the petitioner, and res tore them to their original owner. This matter being one of justice, you should help in arranging it satisfactorily as early as possible.' The Bahrein Chief replied :— ' I have had great pleasure in receiving your wel come letter dated mh R * mz *° ^ , and I have nmlor 20th December 1871 6 Unacr ' stood its purport and your wishes specially in regard to enquiries being made respecting the two boats which originally beionged to Mahomed bin Hossein ot Gwuttur, and which were forcibly taken posses sion of by Saood bin Feysul and given to the people of Bahrein while Saood was in authority. ' I have made enquiries, and find that Saood bin r eysul when in authority was indebted to two per sons of Bahrein, and in payment gave them these two boats.

Meantime certain reports reaelied Colo nel Felly, which strengthened his suspicions of the craft having been irregularly ob tained by Saood. At Colonel Felly's re commendation, therefore, the Chief sent the following reply to the Fasha under flying seal through the Kateef Bey ;— ' 1 beg to enclose, for your Excellency's inform- , ation, a copy of a letter I have received from Ali Beg, Kaimukam of Kateef, purporting to be a reply to my letter to the address of Your Excellency, dated 8th Shawal 1288. ' I regret to observe the menacing tone of the Kai mukam's letter. ' As regards the two craft in question, and which were brought to Bahrein before the arrival of, the Turkish authorities at Kateef, I have already communicated to Your Excellency what I believed to have been the facts of the case. ' As, however, I am most desirous that no possi ble suspicions should rest on me of in any manner conniving- at or sanctioning any irregularity at sea, and as it has been asserted that His Highness Saood bin Feysul obtained the two craft in a manner which has been called in question, 1 am requesting the persons to whom Saood bin Feysul presented the craft to place them at my disposal in order that I may make them over in the presence of the British Officers at Bahrein to whomsoever Your Excellency may depute to receive them. ' On the 9th February Colonel Felly signalled : Assistant Resident reports Bahrein Chief accepted my counsels and rejoined to Fasha accordingly. All quiet/' 33. Reasons for non-interference of British Government in opera tions by land. —From the commence ment of the Turkish Expedition both Colonel Herbert and Colonel Felly have repeatedly expressed an opinion that the ultimate object of the Expedition is the acquisition of Bahrein, Muscat, and the Arabian Coast. Writing on the 26th April,* the Ambassa dor at Constantinople observed :— ' Midhut Fasha has the reputation of an able and energetic administrator, but if he is actuated by the desire attributed to him by Colonel Herbert of extending the authority of the Forte, I can detect nothing here to make me suppose that any such project would be encouraged by the Grand Vizier, although His Highness shows himself excessively sensitive to any remark which he con siders to imply a doubt of the rights of the Sul tan over Nejd districts.' The repeated and positive assurances of the Porte denying the existence of any 1246 nrff pa&lt;;i' 17^- * Page 14S. NE.JP PXPEDITION PRKCIS intention such as that imputed to tli( rn have already been alluded to in para^rapli 10, and subsequent assurances to the same eftect have not been wanting. The Bombay Government, however, in a letter dated 18th July 1871, No. 321'i,* observed;— ' It does not appear to His Excellency the Gover nor in Council that the assurances ol the iuikish Government are as satisfactory as they seem to be regarded by the Government of India. On the contrary, they seem to be founded on a claim which may be productive of much complication hereafter, and which His Excellency in Council regrets to see admitted. ' The Porte proposes that its only object is to restore the authority of its Kaimukam, the Ruler of Nejd. His Excellency in Council fears it will be found that this covers a claim to the allegiance of all the littoral tribes. The Ameer of Kiadh has received tribute from Muscat, has never ceased to claim authority over Bahrein, the Gwuttur coast, and also Aboothabee. If Sheikh Abdoollah is restored with the support of a Turkish force. His Excellency in Council does not doubt but that the Ameer's claims wall be renewed, and, if renewed and successfully resisted, there appears nothing to prevent Turkish interference with the littoral tribes. His Excellency in Council confesses to apprehensions of great embarrassment for the future, which probably might have been avoided if a more decided tone had been adopted and Turk- kish intervention prevented.' When the instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 12) were communi cated to Midhut Hasha by Colonel Herbert, that officer wrote on the 7th June t:— t Page 217 ' His Excellency notes that Colonel Pelly is instructed to protect the pearl fisheries from all kinds of interference and aggression, which, he states, is also necessary on his part, and has been assigned as a duty of the expeditionary troops; and he notes as a cause of thankfulness that Colonel Pelly is directed by Her Majesty's Indian Government to exert himself and assist in preserv- mg order and tanquillity in that stia. ' I would here remark that the preservation of the tranquillity of the Gulf and protection of the interests of the pearl-fisheries have not hitherto been matters m which the Ottoman Government has assumed to itself any active intervention. ' His Excellency Midhut Pasha then preceeds to leni^k on the protection to be given by Colonel PtUy to certain independent States and tribes': coiS fT^ ng u tha ^ if Sucl1 be not withi n the tion of A1 l l' that Under the j uris dic- r no t Ul bin re ysul, the present project them HrTr 0r mutually with country a Li !l ere be within th e Nejd who aid S'? 1U i S su PP ose( l to be independent ment then llT PT™ the 0ttoman Govot »- expel' him h 0U ' ^ P resent ob ject is only to I ,7™' the Punishment of such tribe will nr 'If with w , hat mast be deemed a solemn againrt the existence or possibility ofNEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 47 existence of an independent tribe in the country of Nejd.' This, Colonel Herbert considered, became an important protest when taken in con nexion with an article in the local Government journal. To this article was appended a list of the towns, houses, &amp;c., in the Province of Nejd, and among the towns mentioned was Bahrein, as also three towns belonging to trucial Chiefs on the Oman Coast:— ' This direct mention/^ said Colonel Herbert, ' of Bahrein and a portion of Oman, as appertaining to Nejd, in a journal which can only be regarded as a Government Gazette, is an indication of the views of (at least) the local Government of this province, which, I think, justifies my want of confidence in the assurances so repeatedly and explicitly given. 'If I mistake not, the whole of the country of Oman is deemed to belong to the de facto Gov ernment of Muscat, and it appears to me desirable that I be instructed as to the views of His Excel lency the Viceroy in Council as reg-ards this country, as it is not improbable that the question may shortly be agitated here.' In case of the Porte obtaining, at least for a time, a nominal supremacy over the Province of Nejd, Colonel Herbert suggested that advantage should be taken of the occasion to bring about a settlement of the long pending question of the frontier between Oman and Nejd. The Bombay Government thought* that the above letter of Colonel Herbert strongly corroborated their previous view as to the possible results of the Turkish Expedition and the real designs of the Bagdad Governor-General:— ' Midhut Pasha,' wrote the Bombay Govern ment, 'has long been known as one of the most able men in Turkey, bent upon extending- the authority of the Porte wherever and whenever an oppor tunity presents itself. The Expedition, it is alleged, is to re-establish the authority of the Lieutenant of the Porte throughout the territory of Nejd. But what are the boundaries of Nejd ? ' It has been pointed out in the letter of this Government above quoted, that the Ameer of Riadh has always claimed a suzerainty over Muscat and Bahrein, and it now appears that the official paper at Bagdad distinctly includes Bahrein and the coun try of Oman to the east within Nejd territory. It is impossible to foresee to what complications these pretensions may lead.' The views of the Government of India on these points will be ascertained by a reference to the following extracts of notes by the Foreign Secretary and His Excel lency the Viceroy, dated the 28th and 29th July 1871. The views therein expressed met with the concurrence of Council Mr. Aitchison wrotef—4« NEJD EXPEDITION PKECIS. ' The Government o£ India are quite aware ot these possible complications. 1 he complications may arise by land or in the Persian Gulf. ith the former we have really no concern, except as they affect our position in the Gulf. It is really a matter of indifference to us whether Bereymee belongs to Nejd or Muscat; and it would be the same with Aboothabee, Debay, and Shargah, were it not that we have treaties with these which affect our position in the Gulf. ' Whether or not these places are included in Nejd is a question of fact. If they are included in Nejd, the degree to which they are dependent on Nejd is also a question of fact. Even if it be admitted that Nejd is a Turkish Pashalik, and the Ameer a Turkish official, and even if the places abovenamed be within the limits of what is known as Nejd, it by no means follows that they form part of the Turkish empire, or that they are not independent. It is quite true that Muscat and the Arab Chiefs have paid tribute to Nejd, and there is no reason why they should not continue to do so. The payment of tribute is by no means inconsistent with sovereign indepen dence.* 'To understand the case thoroughly we must consider the theory of sovereign independence. The relations of the government of every State are two-fold—(1) to its subjects; (2) to its neigh bours. Independence in the first relation consti tutes sovereignty; independence in the second relation constitutes nationality, in the sense in which that word is used in the works on inter national law. Now nationality and sovereigntv do not necessarily co-exist in the same State. A State may be a sovereign power and yet not have nationality,—such, e.g., are the Native States in the interior of India. A State which completely loses both attributes, ceases to exist as a separate State. . Independence admits of no degrees. It is either absolute, or it does not exist at all. But as the relations of a government to its subjects on the one hand, and to its neighbours on the other are numerous and varied, a State may be indepen dent m respect to some of these relations and dependent m respect to others; and there may therefore be various degrees both of sovereigntv and nationality, e.g., a State which has supreme powei to make its own laws cannot at the same time be dependent for the exercise of that power on the permission of some other State; but while possess- mg sovemgn power of legislation, the State may have no power to augment its army or to entertain an army at all; m that particular relation, it may to thp a S ? 1 Ver f gn P0wer at a11 ' but entirely subject relation^a Stat* deZ Tn iZ/ TV 4 '7 P art its mdepT- retain it in others' Ti? ° nal relat,ons ''&lt;1 any, and i? 8 o 14 haS P arkd eovereiirn imwer or .1 0 prerogatives as a a question of fact. a ^ l0n ' ls ' m mer !&gt; c ' se &gt; Sec Wheaton, p. 67, and riiillimore, I., 116. m13 ^U j NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 49 &lt;{ The above propositions^ if carefully considered will, I think, help to clear away much of the obscurity which prevails on questions affecting 1 the relations of these quasi-independent tribes. With the relations of the tribal government to their sub jects we have nothing to do. It is a matter of absolute indifference whether they are sovereign or absolutely controlled by Turkey. Probably the establishment of a strong Turkish influence in their internal administration would be rather an advantage than otherwise. As regards their exter nal or national relations, it is a matter of fact that they have had for many years and still have certain relations with us which are expressed in the trea ties ; as a matter of fact these relations were form ed independently of Turkey or any other power. In respect to their relations with us, as expressed in the treaties, these tribes were and are indepen dent nations. Even if they were to part with every other attribute of national independence, that would not affect the question so far as we are concerned. The Turks may make them pay tri bute, or may put a stop to their power of fighting on land, or destroy any other of their national attributes; but they have no power, without our consent, to touch those relations which as indepen dent States they have formed with us. ' It follows, therefore, that our position at sea in respect to these tribes is in no way affected by their quarrels on land either among themselves or with Turkey. There is nothing therefore in our maritime position to call for our interference on land. Is such interference required by other considerations? I think not. I think it would be rather an advantage than otherwise to establish a firm Turkish rule along the coast. As for Colonel Herbert's suggestion that we should attempt to interfere and define the boundary be tween Nejd and Oman, it would, in my opinion, be most impolitic to do anything of the kind. We never attempted it during all the wars between the Wahabees and Muscat, why should we do it with the Turks? To do so would involve our interference every time the boundary was violated, and as the Turks will never be able to maintain anything but a nominal control over Nejd, there are likely enough to be frequent quarrels between Nejd and Oman as there have been any time within the last 50 years. ' I would therefore limit our action to the maintenance unimpaired of our position at sea. We have already told Colonel Herbert that it is understood between the British and Turkish Gov ernments that the position which we have long held in the Gulf is not in way to be affected by the Expedition against Nejd. To this we should firmly adhere, whether that position depends on our treaties with the Chiefs, or the policy which we have of our own will assumed. The pretensions of Midhut Pasha therefore to the protectorate of the pearl fisheries, assisted by Colonel Pelly, should not be allowed to pass unnoticed. In paragraphs 12,—14 of our despatch No. 28, of 20th May 1870, we have shown that we cannot be associated with Persia in the protectorate of the Gulf, and have given powerful reasons for maintaining unimpaired our old position. The same arguments apply with even greater force to Turkey and should be repeated.'NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. His Excellency the late ^ iceroy re marked * :— ' I really do not know what the Bombay Government want us to do. Do they wish us to define or rather, as Colonel Herbert expresses it, instruct them as to our views in regard k) the whole country of Oman, boundaries, allegiance, jurisdiction, &amp;c. ? ' I always thought that it was one of the well- known maxims of diplomacy that a government who desired peace should not initiate the discussion of complicated and difficult subjects, and should not reply to anticipated questions until they were put. 'I see no necessity whatever for expressing any opinion as to the boundaries of Nejd, Muscat, any portion of Oman, or the littoral of the Persian Gulf, though we are perhaps in a position to offer a sounder opinion on these subjects than any other government, administration, or power. 'The Bombay Government relies upon the ambitious character of Midhut Pasha, and what they call * his well-known designs/ 'For my part I prefer to take as a base of action the positive assurances of the Ministers of the Porte, rather than the character of the Gover nor-General of Bagdad, however well known, or the opinions published in the Bagdad newspaper, no matter how directly that journal may be sup posed to be inspired to by the advisers of the Pasha. ' The Government of India are quite aware of the possible complications that may arise out of the unwise action of the Turkish Government in this matter. ' We have expressed our views to the Secretary of State in the strongest language, and at the very first declared our opinion that every possible amount of diplomatic pressure and persuasion should be exercised to induce the Sultan to abandon this dangerous undertaking. ' We have received assurances more satisfactorv than 1 had at first expected. ' As I said before, I do not know what the Bombay Government want us to do; but all I can say is, that if their advice is to be interpreted into tins—that we should take the present opportunitv ot attempting to define relations and boundaries as between the different Chiefs and States in these districts, I consider it to be a most unwise proposal.

Further narrative of the Expedi tion and Affairs of Nejd. —The ac counts received from time to time regard ing the doings of the Expedition, and events in Central Arabia, are contradictory and unreliable to a degree that makes it almost impossible to give any clear and connected account of what has occurred. Writing too late as the 22nd November, Colonel Pelly requests that the information given by him with regard to events that had happened so far back as three months previous to the date of his letter must be accepted with caution. Colonel Herbert's letter of the 21st June* contains an account of the first operations of the Expedition after landing in Arabia. He writes:— 'The Turkish account of the proceedings of the expeditionary force is, that it reached Ras- Tanureh on the 13th Mais, agreeing to 25th May, and, landing on the following morning, marched towards Kateef. ' That the people occupying the country through which it passed at first showed a disposition to hostility, but the object of the Expedition being explained to them, they were satisfied and express ed gratification at the prospect of being relieved by the presence of Turkish troops from the oppres sion under which they have been suffering. 'That on the troops drawing near to Kateef Syed Mahomed Saeed EfPendi, son of the Nukeeb of Bussorah, and who had accompanied the troops, was, at the repeated written request of Abd-ul- Aziz, commanding the fort on behalf of Saood, sent to him to negotiate. ' That Abd-ul-Aziz stated to him his regret to be obliged to oppose the Imperial troops, but pleaded the many favors he had received from, and the confidence reposed in him by, Saood as his excuse for resistance, and declared his determina tion not to surrender the place until compelled by superior force. ' That he had levelled the mosques and other buildings round the fort with a view to defence, and that he opened fire on the troops who sur rounded the place on three sides, while the Turkish Steamer Assur and the boats from Kowait attacked it by sea, and that it fell after a bombard ment of three hours. ' That after taking possession of this place with the guns, ammunition, and stores it contained, the troops marched to Damam, capturing en route a position called Anuk, which surrendered after a show of resistance, and in which were found threeNEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. guns, besides arms and ammunition and public stores, all of which were placed in charge (&gt;i an officer and guard. ' That Abd-ul-Aziz, son of Saood, who was in Damam, fled on the approach of the troops, and the place was surrendered by Ibn-el-Tehnooneh, Mahomed bin Feysul, who had been confined in it, being set at liberty. ' That Damam was found to be well fortified with three strong lines of defence and to contain eleven guns,—nine iron and two brass,—and a large quantity of ammunition and stores, of all of which possession was taken, proper measures being adopted for their safe keeping. A guard of two companies of infantry were placed in the fort, and the force returned to Kateef, accompanied by Maho med bin Feysul, and taking with it Ibn-el-Tehnooo- neh and the others who were captured at the fall of the place. ' It is now said that the force will proceed to El Hasa, and I am glad to be able to report that His Excellency Midhut Pasha has told me that there is no present intention of their making any attempt to proceed beyond that town.' The above account agrees very well with that published in the Jeundee As- kerjee newspaper, a translation of which was forwarded by Sir H. Elliot.* Major » Page 116. Smith, the Assistant Political Resident in the Gulf, wrote that Kateef surrendered on the 3rd June, and that Damam was taken on the 5th.f f See page 121 for number of troops. 'We obtain only a glimpse of the doings of the force during the remainder of the month of June. Colonel Pelly in tele grams of the 25th, 26th, and 27th of June reported} the Turks to be still at Kateef, I Page 121. preparing for a move to El Hassa or Lahsa, a fertile district, § inland of which Hofoof § Page 311. is a principal fort and chief town. The Arab sea contingent of the Expedition, about 300 craft, || had returned to their || Furnished by the Chief of Kowait homes. The Turkish force was estimated by Colonel Pelly to be 3,000 strong with a contingent of 1,500 Arabs and nine guns. In the meantime an engagement appears to have taken place between Abdoollah and Saood. The latter despatched a force inland from Eahsa which he then occupied against his brother. Abdoollah was de feated, and Saood was himself about to tollow m pursuit. In his letter of the 15th Junef Colonel lei y reported receipt of two letters, dated loth May and 8th June, from Saood, the principal subject matter of which related to permission to operate hy sea 'Tbe request/' says Colonel Pelly, ' was vaeuelv put, bat 1 ascertained that the real object was to obtain from me a general permission „r at Et promise that we would not interfere, and then that % Page 239.BiSSM t'J&amp;'Sm.rm.HUfi.rc* * Page 257. f Page 223.

NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. my letter would be circulated to the Aboothabee and other trueial Chiefs as sanctioning their putting to sea in favor of the Wahabees much in the same manner as the Kowait tribe have done in favor of the Turks.' Colonel Pelly declined to reply at the time to these queries. On arrival at Kateef the Turkish Com mander addressed a proclamation * to ' all residing in Lahsa, Kateef, and the provinces of Nejd/' informing them that Nejd and its depen dencies form part of the Turkish posses sions similarly to Irak, Yemen, Egypt, &amp;c. The proclamation next went on to say that Saood having overthrown the authority of Abdoollah, the Kaimukam appointed by the Sultan under the Bagdad Government, a force had been despatched to assist Abdoollah and bring the people under his rule. Saood was promised pardon if he came in and apo logized for his conduct: otherwise he and the tribes that supported him would be destroyed'. The tribes that remained at Lahsa and Kateef were promised favor and protection. Midhut Pasha had ex pected Abdoollahf to join the expeditionary force at Kateef, but the latter was either unwilling or unable to do this. J The Pasha told Colonel Herbert that he hoped to attain the object he had in view by negotiation and without the employment of force, and with this view he sent with the Expedition Munsoor Beg, formerly Sheikh of the Montefik, and several other influential Arabs to act as parlementaires. Early in July § the Turkish troops marched from Kateef and reached Lahsa. According to a report by one of Colonel Pelly's Moonshees, Perek Pasha, the Turkish Commander, was 15 days getting to Lahsa, owing to the heat and the illness of his men. The march of the Turks was not opposed, and the forts were all given up without resistance of any kind. Saood, who was reported to be in Eiadh with a large force, seemed anxious to avoid any collision with the Ottoman troops, and only desirous of drawing them away from this base of operations on the coast. Colonel Herbert wrote on the 19th July || :— ' Whenever they {i .e., the Turks) may have established themselves in El Hassa, they will, if he (Saood) be really as strong as is said, be almost entirely at his mercy, as he will possess the power of surrounding them and cutting off their communication with the coast. ' A report, which seems to be reliable, has reached me that the Expedition lost as many as four 14 r64 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. hundred men at Kateof from eholcra and want of food. ' Provisions were scarce and had been damaged in transit. The men are said to have been living on rice and water, and it seems they were in a piti able condition when they marched from Kateet. ' It is further rumoured that Saood had utterly defeated Abdoollah, and that he has offered to pay tribute to Turkey, at the same time expressing his determination to resist invasion of the country. ' This seems to be generally believed to be true.' On the 1st August Colonel Herbert wrote :— ' It is stated that the force is much reduced in numbers bv deaths from sickness and want of food, and is much dispirited. ' Sheikh Faleh, son of Nasir Pasha, Sheikh of the Montefik, with the contingent of Arab horse men which had accompanied the Expedition to El Hassa, reached Kowait on his return on the 26th instant. ' It is reported that, from the time of joining the Expedition, he had only received seven days' commissariar supplies for his men and animals, and on his applying for help to the General in com mand, Natiz Pasha, the latter stated his inability k) aid him, and recommended his return with his contingent; that they marched accordingly, but without supplies of any kind; and that they lost very many horses on the way to Kowait from want of food and water. ' Munsoor Beg, Ex-Sheikh of the Montetik, Suliman Zaheir, Ex-Sheikh of Zobair, and Syed Mahomed Saeed, brother of Syed Abd-ool-Rehman, Nakeeb of Bussorah, are said to be on their way back, and therefore Nafiz Pasha, with his reduced body of troops, is left without support at El Hassa. ' Saood is still reported to be in possession of Riadh and Nejd Proper. The whereabouts of Abdoollah is not distinctly known, but he is said to be not far from the capital, probably at Kharij, to the south, and it is said that the inhabitants of the country are endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation between the brothers with the view to their combining to get rid of the Ottoman troops. ' ^ to be apprehended that the position of these last is very precarious.' Colonel Felly's Moonsliee, writing in July, reported AMoollah to be two davs' mareh from lliadli:— ' Saood,' he said,* ' has no money and has expenses. Abdoollah bin Feysul is now located at a place called Akhremeh, two days' journey from Kiadh, and has followers from the Nejd country and is also in want of money. He was originallv anxious to be friends with his brother Saood ; but when letters from the parts of Bahrein informed him that the Turkish army intended to establish him as Imam, he would not consent, and is wait, ing to see what turn affairs will take, but was unable to get across to the Turks on account of the insecurity of the roads.'

Pasha is now at Lahsa^ and is unable to move fur ther on account of the sickness, heat, and hot winds. ' It is said that if the people of Nejd join to g-ether, no one will be able to subdue them. But now they are separated, some following' Saood and some Abdoollah, and that to a certainty their enemies will subdue them. ' At heart the people of Nejd do not like the sons of Feysul on account of their oppression and unjust taxes, and on this account they are now ruined. ' Ibrahim Beg has a following of 800 Turks in Kateef, and has ordered the streets to be swept and watered. He has ordered bazaars to be established out of the fort. About 70 prostitutes from Bag dad were brought to Kateef in the Snipe, and 80 wine sellers, and their business is flourishing. ' People say if the Nejdees be certain of these proceedings, they may join together and fight the Turks, as the Wahabees do not consent to such acts. ' Some of the merchants of Kateef have com municated these proceedings to the people of Nejd, and they will know that the Turks are of another creed. They are now assured that the intention of the Turks is to place Abdoollah bin Feysul as their Imam, and that their religion will rule as before.' The position of affairs in the beginning of August is thus described by Colonel Pelly in his letter of the 14th of that month* :— \st. —The Turkish force is in occupation of the fertile district and ports of Lahsa; and the ques tion is being discussed between the Commander of the forces and the Turkish authorities as to whether the Expedition should for the present remain at Lahsa, or whether constituting Lahsa an intermediate base of operations, the Expedition should advance into Nejd. ' Rnd.—The Commander of the forces would seem to be in favour of halting where he is, at all events, until the weather cools and rain falls. The Turkish authorities, on the other hand, would seem to be urging an advance, and contemplating an invasion of Nejd by a combined movement of the forces now in occupation of portions of the Arabian Littorals of the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Should this alleged combined operation be successfully carried into effect it might have im portant results, and would seem to indicate an intention permanently to occupy Peninsular Arabia as a Turkish province. «^rd.—The Expedition appears to intend strengthening its sea base by the erection of forts at Ojair and in the neighbourhood of Kateef, while the line of communication between those ports and Lahsa is to be secured by fortified posts at every caravan stage. « 4^.—Arrangements appear to have been made for the occupation of Gwuttur. But this region con tinues as yet in a distracted state, pressed on by the Turks, and harassed by the Bedouins, who appear, at the instigation of Saood bin Feysul, to be marauding or aggressing all along the southern flank of the Turkish line of communication.'nth —Tlie respective positions of the contending 1 brothers, Abdoollah and Saood bin Feysul, do not seem to be certainly known. Neither seem to be in LTcat force, while the tribes and the inhabitants of the Capital Riadh appear to be awaiting either the imprisonment or death of one of the as pirants.'' On the 28th August, * Colonel Pelly re ported two fights between Abdoollali and Saood. The latter was said to have been killed and Saood wounded. The Turkish Commander was becoming uneasy about his communication with the coast and was calling for reinforcements, two or three hundred men had been pushed on to Lahsa from Kateef and Ojair. Colonel Felly's estimate of the strength of the Turkish force was as followsf :— In the Fort at Kateef, of whom perhaps 150 sick ... ... 50U At Ojair ... ... ... ... 150 Reinforcement en route to Lahsa .,. 225 Head-quarters in and around the forts of Lahsa, of whom 1,000 sick ... 2,500 Total strength ... 3,400 Deduct sick ... 1,150 Effective ... 2,500 This he thought was perhaps over the the mark. The Arab Contingent was about 2,000 men. Gwuttur J was being overrun by the Bedouins, who were also plundering between Ojair and Lahsa. The Chief of Bahrein had ordered the Bedouins who were on the island to leave the place, and most of them had crossed over to Gwuttur. Pereck Pasha had been raising recruits in Lahsa, and had got about 900 men at 6 dollars a month. It was said that Fereck Fasha had invited Saood to come to Lahsa, but the latter refused to trust himself there. * Page 352. t Page 353. + Page 208. § Pages 300-301. H Page 360. XEJB EXPEDITION PKEOIS- . ^ son of Saood's, named Abdool Azeez, visited Bahrein § in the end of August, and was received in great state by the Chief. Nothing is said as to the object of his visit, or how long he stayed in Bahrein.

He certainly did reach the Turkish camp eventually, but when and how he got T? 18 ! (luite uncer tain.

No movements appear to have taken place during October, bnt on the 22nd November * Colonel Pelly reported :— ' So far as I can gather (and requesting always that all information based on native report may be received with caution), the position of affairs is somewhat as follows :— ' 1^.—It appears that Saood having approached Lahsa precipitated an action; and after some par tial success was defeated by the Turkish force at Lahsa. ' 2nd. —That Saood then retired on Gwuttur fol lowed by a considerable number of Bedouins, who have now intimated to Mahomed bin Tanee and other G-wuttur Chiefs that they must elect between supplying the wants of Bedouins or having their towns or territory pillaged. On receipt of this news I gave our Indian subjects in Gwuttur the usual warning. ' 3rd. —That Saood has sent Envoys to the Bah rein Chief in view to his receiving asylum in the event of necessity. The Bahrein Chief com municated with me on this subject, and my advice to him has been that Saood should refrain from ap proaching the island in order to prevent any sem blance of a breach of absolute neutrality on the part of Bahrein. Copies of the Chiefs letter and of my reply are appended. ' kth.—It appears that the Pasha of Bagdad left the river about the 9th or 10th instant, pro ceeded to Kowait, passed a day there, and then came on with three steamers and a considerable body of troops to Kateef, where he arrived about the 13th or 14th instant; that he is now at Kateef with his troops encamped on the plain, as Kateef, like Bahrein, is plagued at this season by virulent fever, which is said to have caused much loss to the Turkish force, after it had ceased to suffer from cholera. « foh.—It is stated to be the intention of the Pasha to proceed almost immediately inland to Lahsa, but whether with the object of consolidat ing the Government at that point, or of forward ing the Expedition towards Eiadh, does not appear. Rumour, however, alleges that the Turkish authori ties have issued a document, notifying the inten tion of the Turkish Government to assume direct control over Kateef and Lahsa to the exclusion of the Wahabee dynasty. It is, I think, to be borne in mind that the Turkish Expedition has not as yet entered the districts of Nejd, strictly so called.' On the same day Colonel Pelly wrote that a messenger sent to observe matters at Kateef had ascertained, said Colonel Pelly, ' that the Pasha of Bagdad embarked last night at Kateef for Ojair, taking on board with him an escort of some three hundred men; and that it is the intention of the Pasha to proceed from Ojair to Lasha. This report is confirmed by the appear ance of the Pasha's steamer passing towards Ojair this morning. « —That the Turkish Commodore is ordered by the Pasha to hold one of his vessels in readiness off Kateef, to send a second back to Busreh for 15supplies, and to proceed himself in a third to Bahrein in view to meeting me and for other business. ' Srd.—That the report of the flight &lt;&gt;f His Highness Abdoollah, together with his son, Toorkee, from Lahsa towards Riadh is reliable. It further appears that His Highness' brother, Mahomed, had left Lahsa a few days previously; and that Abdool- lah left a letter for the Turkish Commander stating that the Turkish force having been professedly organized for his (Abdoollah's) restoriition to power, had been utilized to supplant both himself and his dynasty; and that he would, therefore, no longer trust Turkish aid or promises.' On the 23rd November Colonel Pelly wrote:— ' Yesterday evening the Turkish Commodore anchored with a corvette and a gun vessel in the Bahrein harbour. He hoisted the r l urkish Hag at his main and fired a salute of 21 guns. On being asked with the usual etiquette by our Senior aval Officer as to w r hom the salute was intended for, he replied that he was saluting the forts on shore, and that as he had no Arab flag on board he had hoisted the Turkish flag. He added that he had done the same at Muscat. ' To-day the Commodore and I exchanged visits, and he was by no means reticent concerning the Expedition to Nejd. He said that the Pasha of Bagdad had proceeded to Lahsa for the purpose of enquiring into some complaints of alleged cor ruption, of settling the Government at Lahsa, and of arranging for the advance of the Expedi tion to the Wahabee capital. It was unlikely that the Pasha would himself accompany the Expedition to Riadh, but Fereck Pasha, the Com mander-in-Chief, would in all probability move the Lahsa force there during the present winter. The Commodore estimated the Lahsa force at from 9 to 10,000 men independently of irregulars. He said that the recent defeat of Saood had been deci sive ; that Abdoollah and his brother had escaped; and that the Turkish Government would now pro bably depute a person of rank from Constantino ple as Governor-General of the Wahabee territory. He admitted that the Expedition had been costly, and that permanently holding the country could never pay, but he deemed the principal object of the Porte to be to rid themselves of Wahabee annoyances to pilgrims passing across Arabia to and from Mecca; to accomplish this, he said, con cerned the Sultan in his capacity of head of the Mussulman religion. NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. The Commodore alleged that the road between the coast line and Lahsa is now so safe that single postmen pass along it. He added that it was the intention of the Pasha to erect a new town in the neighbourhood of Kateef. He had himself accom- . panied the Pasha in an excursion for the selection o a site, and the Pasha had chosen a position about tour miles distant from the present fort of Jvateet, where sweet water is plentiful, and the surrounding country open.' Referring to Kowait, the Commodore intormed Colonel Pelly that the Chief had been regularly installed there on the recentix * The Pasha's intention in going to Bahrein was to press the matter regarding the murder of the Turkish messenger (vide paragraph ).

In a letter of the 4th December Colonel Pelly writes— ' Midhut Pasha arrived at Lahsa about eight days ago, and is said to have expressed dissatisfac tion with the Commander of the Turkish Forces on account of the escape of Abdoollah bin Feysul. ' Meantime all reports concur in alleging that Abdoollah has reached his capital Hiadh, whence as it is said he has addressed a letter to the Turkish authorities complaining that, whereas they entered his country with his consent, and for the concerted object of reinstating him in power, they had practically placed him under restraint and purposed supplanting his dynasty by direct Turkish Rule; that he had now escaped; but was still willing to pay tribute and arrange matters, provided the Porte should acknowledge him as Imam of the Wahabee territories; but that, failing this, he would endeavour to hold his own, and that Nejd was a country not easy either to take or to hold.' Midhut Pasha was shortly expected at Ojair, and was then to proceed to Kateef and Bahrein,* in which latter place Colonel Pelly was with the Lynx, Magpie, and Hugh Hose. ' Native Merchants from Lahsa and Kateef/' said Colonel Pelly, ' report that material is collected at Has Tannoorah for the construction of a fort. As also at a point called Bremeh midway between Ojair and Lahsa. It seems that the Turks are using Norton's pumps in boring for water. The merchants express themselves as being much alarmed at the occupation of the Turks; and add that, for the time being, commercial confidence is quite des troyed.' Colonel Herbert in a letter of the 3rd January reported the return of Midhut Pasha to Bagdad on the 28th December. The Pasha brought back a great number of invalid soldiers from El Hassa and Kateef. Colonel Herbert wrote :— ' The state of the garrisons at El Hassa and Kateef is reported to be very bad, sickness prevails among the troops to a great extent, and their numbers are said to be so much reduced that Nafiz Pasha is compelled to act purely on the defensive, and can hardly repulse the frequent raids of the Arabs, who, it seems, continue to harrass them even in the absence of the principal Chiefs. ' Abdoollah is reported to be in Riadh and Saood to continue in the neighbourhood of Grwttur, while a correspondence is said to be going on between them, though as yet it is not known that they have come to any terms. ' Meantime Midhut Pasha shows no intention of withdrawing from his aggressive, costly, and hopeless policy in Nejd. While at Bussorah on his way back to Bagdad he purchased from the Persian Governor of Mahomrah a steam vessel to run between Bussorah and Kateef, and on the 1st instant a detachment of about 300 soldiers left this to supply the place of some of the sick men whom he brought up.NEJD EXPEDTTTON PRECIS. ' This country is thus being denuded of troops to a considerable extent, and it is highly probable that these will be needed here in the spring. «The Arabs are said to be much disaffected, particularly the Shammar, who are excited by the mode of execution at Moosul of their late Sheikh, Abdool Kurreem. Rain is now falling abundantly throughout the country and will fill the wells in the desert, and a rising is considered by no means impossible.'^ Colonel Felly's last news, dated 13tli January, was that the Turkish Commodore had proceeded to El Biddeh taking with him the steamer Assur and a battalion ot regular troops. These he landed at El Biddeh against the will of the Chiefs. Colo nel Pelly wrote:— ' This practical experience of what is meant by Turkish friendship may, perhaps, account for the Gwuttur Chief having addressed a very polite letter to me.' The following report of the landing at El Biddeh is given by the Assistant Political Resident in his news gleanings:— ' The two Turkish ships at El Biddeh saluted and invited the Chief, Mahomed bin Sanee, on board ; he excused himself, but afterwards, at the request of Abdoollah bin Subah, Chief of Kowait, he went on board, accompanied by his son. ' The Turkish Commander presented dresses of honor both to the Chief and his son, and said to the former, you asked for help, and we have been ordered to come here and help you, and will land the troops. The Chief replied, I did ask for help, but it was when I was at feud with Saood; now we are friends, you had better go back again; this is no place for you; there is no food for you or your thousand men. The officer said my orders are to land, and land I must, you had better write to my Govern ment to say you don't want us, and I will then go when ordered. The force landed and took posses- sion of a fort called ' £1 Maselim' and a few houses near it. The people of El Biddeh are very angrv at this occupation of the place. The larger Turk- tTjj left ' but the smaller was still at El Biddeh. Regarding the brothers Abdoollah and baood, Colonel Pelly wrote: ' Abdoollah bin Feysul continues to live at Rudh, while his brother Saood hangs on on the desert skirts of Gwuttur.

Colonel Pelly in a letter dated 27th January wrote*— ' The reports I have received from many points extending from Busreh to the pirate coast bear a common resemblance, but are all of them more or less unreliable. ' I gather, generally, however, that the Turkish force at Lahsa has been reduced below its original strength; but that reinforcements are being sent to Kateef in Snipe, which steamer the Turkish authorities have recently purchased. ' Ind.—That Abdoollah bin Feysul is still at Riadh in communication with his brother Saood, who with a body of Bedouins is moving about on the inland skirts of Gwuttur. ' K&gt;rd.—That Saood in turn is in communication with the Turkish Commander at Lahsa in view to a meeting at a place called ' Cheranab •' the Principals seem to mistrust each other. ' Mh.—That the Turkish troops have been with drawn from El Biddeh in Gwuttur, leaving there only a detachment for the protection of stores, &amp;c. It is also generally believed that the Arabs of Gwuttur are dissatisfied with Turkish proceedings.' 35. Attitude of Bahrein Chief. Evi dence of Turkish designs against Bahrein. —As already shown in para. 8, the Chief of Bahrein at the commencement of the Expedition expressed his reliance on trucial engagement, and requested advice and protection from the British Govern ment. On receipt of the assurances from the Turkish Government {vide paragraph 10] that no intention was entertained of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, the Chief was informed accordingly f by Colo nel Pelly on the 26th May, and told that the Turkish Expedition in no way affected the treaty rights and obligation of the British Government or trucial Chiefs. In subse quent letters t the Chief was directed to observe strict neutrality, and that as long as he observed Articles II. and III. of the Treaty§ with the British Government, that Government would fulfil its obligations. The Chief in reply || expressed himself de termined not to act against these agree ments in any way. In accordance with the advice and in structions received by him the Chief has throughout carefully abstained from com mitting himself with either of the bel ligerent parties, and has always shown himself ready to accept and act on the advice of Colonel Pelly, more especially in the matter of the murder of the Turkish messenger (paragraph 31) and the demand made on him by Midhut Pasha for the surrender of two boats (paragraph 32). ie I fv i NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. When it was thought that Midhut Pasha was about to visit Bahrein the Chief asked * for instructions from Colonel Pelly as to his behaviour on the occasion. Co lonel Pelly recommended him to be cour teous to all guests of consequence who visited his territories, but absolutely to abstain from mixing himself up in any quarrels that might be going on beyond his own frontiers. In October 1871 a misunderstanding arose between the Chief and his brothers w r hich might have been inconvenient at that juncture had not an amicable settle ment been arrived at. According to the Chiefs account,f he had hitherto assigned to his two brothers a third of the revenues of Bahrein, but, urging that this was not sufficient for them, they demanded one- half, which the Chief eventually consented to give so that there might be no opening for his enemies to intervene. Abdool Azeez, a son of Saood, appears to have visited Bahrein in August^ and to have been received with great ceremony by the Chief. There is nothing to show what was his object in visiting the island, nor is any further mention made of him in the subsequent reports. Notwithstanding the explicit assurances of the Ottoman Porte as regards Bahrein indications have not been wanting of a desire on the part of the Bagdad local authorities to obtain some pretext for in terfering in the affairs of the island. The tone of the Pasha's letters on the subject ol the murder of the messenger and the demand for surrender of the two Kowait boats (paragraphs 32 and 33) needs no comment. * Page 320. t Page 375.

But that it had not been accorded to them. 'The Pasha then asked me if I thought I could procure the signatures of 50 or 60 substan tial Bahrein merchants and others to a petition begging for Turkish rule. I said perhaps such a thing might be done, but I was doubtful. ' The Pasha asked how long it would take me to try and collect the names. I said three or four days. He said very well, then I will delay my departure from Kateef for three days. I told him that success in the matter would seem to be very doubtful. But that I would report to him at the end of three days. 'On the occasion of my second interview, however, the Pasha remarked that he must return at once to Bagdad, that the matter of the peti tion, therefore, had better be dropped, but that I might obtain something from my own relatives in regard to Turkish rule, and accordingly the Chief of Kowait, who was in the Pasha's suite, gave me a letter for one of my relatives opening communication and offering him advantages at Kateef.' The same Arab stated tliat lie had been offered a Turkish flag by the Commodore of the Ottoman fleet. One of the papers found on the body of the messenger murdered at Bahrein was a letter from a son of Nassir bin Mobarek, the escaped pirate, in which the former says:— 1 ' The Turks are mindful of Gwuttur, Bahrein, and and other places in view to putting down their enemies so that their friends may rejoice/' This letter is alluded to by the Bahrein Chief in his letter to the Pasha (para graph 31). Writing in November* Colonel Pelly says:— 'The general tone and tendency of the Turkish proceedings for some months past leave little doubt in my mind as to the intentions or at least wishes of His Excellency Midhut Pasha towards Bahrein/' Referring to the departure of the Pasha from the Gulf, Colonel Pelly on the 21st Decembert telegraphed 'The Government policy and holding our ships persistently before Bahrein in my opinion brought the Pasha and Turkish Squadron to abandon their intended interference, and our success is publicly felt in these regions to be a timely and necessary check to Turkish pretensions which were before mis understood to our prejudice/ 36.

He has throughout been an active ally of the Turks, and aided them, on the landing of the Expedition, with a fleet of some three or four hundred boats.* Colonel Pelly expressed an opinionf that the bribe to the Chief was to have been found in Bahrein. According to Saood 's letters to Colonel Pelly { it appears that his friend ship for Abdoollah bin Feysul was also one of his reasons for aiding the Turks and acting against Saood. It was Abdoollah bin Subah, the Kowait Chief, who took the Turkish flags to El Biddeh§ and induced Jassim, the son of the Gwuttur Chief, to hoist one on his house. An emis- sa^ from Kowait visited Biddeh in May and spread false reports of the removal from office of the Resident, and declared it to be the intention of the Turks to take possession of Bahrein and other places on the shores of the Gulf. This intelligence disturbed the minds of some of the Gwuttur tribes and more especially Jassim, son of the Gwuttur Chief, and Nasir bin Mobarek, the escaped pirate from Bahrein, who immediately prepared or pretended to prepare for the contingency of a Turkish rule in Nejd with Abdoollah as a Lieute nant- Governor. a a ^ a ^ er stage of the Expedition Abdoollah bin Subah was heard ofj| as intriguing with the Chiefs of Gwuttur and Bahrein m the interests of the Turks. He attempted to induce them to visit the Turkish Commodore at Kateef, and threat ened the latter that if he did not come, 'the officer might think of another Ruler for Mahomed^ 7 ^ Mobarek or Jassim hin About August last the Kowait Chief who had accompanied the Expedition into the mterior solicited permissionl from the Turkish Commander to return to Kowait, which was granted.

Origin of Expedition.— The Ameer Feysul, Imam of the Wahahees, died in 1865,* and was succeeded by his son Abdool- lah, who had been virtnally Ruler of Nejd for many years during the old age and blind ness of his father. Abdoollah is a narrow bigotted Wahabee of the orthodox type, while Saood, his younger brother, laxer in the observance of his religious duties, has more of the careless and open nature of the Bedouin. When Palgrave visited Nejd he predicted that the death of Feysul would prove the signal for a bloody and equally matched war between the two brothers. His predictions were very shortly to be verified. Soon after the accession of Abdoollah the struggle commenced and continued with varying fortune for some years. Saood was in the end completely successful, and the deposed Abdoollah ap pealed for assistau/ce to, or accepted the proffered assistance of, the Turks. Hence the despatch of the Turkish expedition to Nejd. 2. First report of intended Expedi tion. —Some rumour of an intended ex pedition reached the Indian Government in the beginning of 1871, and Colonel Herbert was asked by telegraph on the 17th February whether it was true that the Ottoman Government were preparing a force at Bagdad with the view of occu pying positions on the Arabian Coast. He replied that there was apparently no found ation for the rumour, and that no troops were available for such a purpose; he would report immediately if any such design was ascertained. Colonel Herbert at the same time telegraphed to Her Majesty's Ambas sador at Constantinople, enquiring whether, as rumoured in Bagdad, the Porte con templated sending four ships of war to the Persian Gulf, and whether there was any intention of occupying positions there in. He received a reply that the Porte denied all intention of occupying positions in the Gulf, but two of the vessels com posing the Yemen expedition were to be stationed between the Bed Sea and the Persian Gulf. 3. Design of Expedition revived— On the 27th March Colonel Herbert intimated by telegraph that, under orders from Con-2 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. stantinople, an expedition was about to be sent by land and sea from Bagdad towards Nejd with the view of supporting Abdool- lah. He was asked in reply how the Tur- Pages 7-8. kish expedition by sea was to go, and at what part of the Arab Coast it was pro posed that it should land. His answer was that it would go in one corvette and three unarmed steamers and in such other vessels as could be obtained, and that it would disembark at Kateef or Demaum. 4. Position of parties in Nejd.— In consequence of this news, the Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed on the 28th March to telegraph the latest parti culars about Wahabee affairs and to de scribe the situation of the contending par ties. It was ascertained from him that the Pages 7-8. TV ahabee Ameer, Saood (brother of Ab- doollah), still held the district of Lahsa, or El Hassa, with the sea coast, and that he was about to move for another battle with his brother. Abdoollah was a fugitive. A letter from Colonel Pelly,* dated 11th # P- 39. March, contained substantially the same intelligence. 5. Expedition temporarily postpo ned : Enquiries made from Porte regarding it.— On the 31st March, Colonel Herbert was requested to ascertain from the Pasha whether any communica tion had been made to our Minister at Page 8. Constantinople on the subject of the expe dition. He replied that the Pasha did not know. The expedition had, he said, been temporarily postponed. All the informa tion regarding the expedition was tele- graphed home to the Secretary of State on the 31st March, and he was told :— ' Warlike operations in any part of Gulf to be deprecated as breach of maritime peace, destructive our trade, and likely to give rise to complica- lons.

NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. The Bombay Government was told:— ' In event of expedition sailing-, Pelly should not interfere with proceedings of Turkish authorities without specific orders from Government of India, to whom he should immediately report. If Arabs take part in quarrel, he should limit his action strictly to maintaining maritime truce. No vessel need be sent specially to Persian Gulf. 'Forte, understood to have sailed yesterday.' Colonel Pelly enquired on the 23rd April— ' Am I correct in understanding that Government of India desire me to use all influence towards preventing trucial Chiefs aiding Wahabees against Turks, or in any way moving by sea ? What reply am I to give to trucial Chiefs if, continuing to observe maritime peace, they ask whether we will protect them attempting (?) from sea by Turks ? Would it not be advisable to intimate to Turkish authority our engagement with trucial Chiefs, as it is suspected Turks may have an eye on Bahrein 7. Preparations for Expedition re sumed. —Colonel Herbert telegraphed, on the 17th April, that preparations for the expedition were being resumed, and that it would leave Bagdad in a few days. Three steam vessels had been ordered to convey six regiments and 12 guns. One thousand Arab horses to go by land. The first portion of the force left Bagdad on the 23rd April, and another detachment two days after. 8. Complications in Gulf. —The Bom bay Government, on the 3rd May, forward ed the following from Colonel Pelly;— ' Imam Saood f and Bahrein Chief J write that Turkish Arab Chief of Kowait is preparing to aid expedition. Imam requests Kowait may be re strained, or Imam be permitted to act by sea. Bahrein Chief relies on trucial engagement and requests advice and protection. My respectful opinion is, that Turkish expedition is on every account inexpedient, and should, if possible, be averted. If persisted in, Indian Government are not committed to interfere under trucial engage ment as between Wahabees, Kowaits, and Turks. I think we could not assent to a naval attack by Turks or Kowait on trucial Chiefs loyal to their engagements with us. I respectfully solicit early instructions on this telegram and that of SJSind April.'§ The Bombay Government observed:— ' It is probable Turkish Governor may count on our known policy preventing all naval operations by littoral powers in Gulf, but Turkey no party to truce. To prevent Wahabee from acting by sea against Turk or Kowait if allied with Turkey is practically an active interference in favor of Turkey. Neither Wahabee nor Kowait parties to truce.' On the 9th May the following enquiry from Colonel Pelly was received through the Bombay Government:— ' Can Turks and Kowait make trucial Chiefs harbour a basis of operations against VV ahabecsNEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. •A. paragraph 12. in friendly relations with Chiefs ? * * * I presume British subjects employed on Turkish vessels could not be concerned in molestation of trucial Chief * ® 1or re P'' es these questions of Colonel PelJy, see Colonel Felly's object in asking this last question is explained in his letter No. 505-130, dated 20th May. He was under the impression that the debarkation could only be effected by force and by aid of the fleet's artillery. A debarkation of this character would, in his opinion, constitute a maritime operation, and would— a afford ground for misrepresentation and even misunderstanding of our known policy of prevent ing all naval operations by the littoral powers of the Persian Gulf.' 9. British policy in the Persian Gulf. —That policy how affected by Nejd Expedition. —It is now time to take a general view of the British policy in the Gulf, and to see how that policy was likely to be affected by the Turkish expedition. The following is extracted from the Foreign Secretary's Note, dated 3rd May 1871: f— t Pages 24-26. ' It should never be forgotten that, in all its main features, our position in the Persian Gulf is one which we have taken up on grounds of policy. Its foundation in Treaty is of the most meagre and narrow kind. In reality it is a position which we have arbitrarily assumed as an act of State or conquest, the justification of it lying, Jirst, in the circumstances of the time at which we entered on it; and secondly, the length of time during which we have asserted the position we have as- sumed. His -Excellency in Council may, perhaps, not be aware how exceedingly narrow is the scope ot the Treaty engagements with the Arab tribes tor the maintenance of the peace at sea. The Chief of Bahrein is bound by his special agreement to abstain trom all maritime aggressions of every descnpt 1011 so long as he is protected by the Bri- nt- t ove ™ me ^ ^ rom similar aggressions by the Chiefs and tnbes of the Gulf. But the Chiefs who have subscribed the perpetual peace have bound themselves only to abstain from aggressions sub 3«cts of the subscribing parties, and our right or duty to interfere in virtue of the Treaty is lumted to cases in which one of the parties to the maritime peace commits an outrage on another, in all other cases our interference with warlike JeZTnTh W pt th f by P arties t0 tlie Tr eaty of TVeatv ' J ^ who are not parties to that o^n L 1 e ^ 0nn0better Nation than our W d^™ r V 0 80 ' and the fact that we havp nn T ?

NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 5 subjects to re-establish authority in their own coun- tiy. The recent teleg-rams make this by no means certain, but even if it be the case, it hardly affects the question. We cannot make our policy at sea depend on Arab politics ashore; we cannot attempt to make our interference to prevent an expedition by sea depend on the justice or injustice of the claims which the expedition is intended to assert. To do so would involve us in the intricate domestic relations of the Arab tribes, which we neither know nor are capable of understanding. Hitherto our policy has been to prevent all expeditions by sea, and to impose the restriction on all alike, both great and small. The possibility of our maintain ing our position seems to me to depend on our maintaining it in its integrity. If we admit ex ceptions, I do not see where we can stop in our retreat till we reach the narrow ground covered by our Treaties. We shall never make the exceptions intelligible to those who are not admitted to the benefit of them. If the Turks send their troops by sea, the W r ahabees and the Arab Chiefs who support Saood have clearly a right to attack them by sea. If the Arabs are defeated, we cannot prevent the Turks from exercising over them all the rights of successful war, and establishing their supremacy over the Arab country. There is then an end to our policy in the Gulf; or if the Arab Chiefs, remaining quiet now, wish hereafter to fit out some naval force, how are we to prevent them when we have permitted the Turks to do so, or how are we to make the prohibition intelligible ? Or if Persia, desirous to have a fleet in the Gulf to establish her claims to supremacy, should throw herself on some foreign power and procure vessels of war, on what grounds are we to remonstrate ? She could only do so on grounds equally applicable to the prevention of this expedition, and by de clining to interfere with this expedition, we almost debar ourselves from urging those grounds against Persia, or at all events greatly weaken the force of the argument and the value of the remonstrance. This expedition is like the little rent in the em bankment, insignificant in itself and easily repaired at first, but if not repaired, certain to end in the destruction of the whole work. Various despatches, ending with No. 28 of the 20th May 1870, had been addressed to the Secretary of State regarding the policy of the British Government in the Gulf. No replies had up to this time been received to any of these. Thus the precise rela tions in which the British Government stood in regard to such powers as Turkey and Persia, as well as to the less powers, not having been precisely determined, it was difficult for the Government of India to adopt a tangible and intelligible policy. Colonel Felly's telegram regarding Kowait {vide paragraph 8) illustrated the 3rd May difficulties of the position. Kowait* is a port on the extreme north-west of the Persian Gulf;— ' The inhabitants acknowleged the sovereignty of the Porte, and use the Turkish flag, though their allegiance to the Sultan is merely nominal.6 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. The ruling family are a branch of the T [ ttoobee tribe with the patronymie 'Al Subah/ I he Bahrein family, it will be remembered, are also a branch of the Uttoobees. Colonel Pelly was quite right in stating* that the 'Indian Government are not committed to interfere under trucial engagements as between W ahabees, Kowaits, and Turks/ But neither are we, except in regard to Bahrein, committed to interfere under trucial engagements, as between Turks, Kowaits, and the trucial Chiefs. We are committed under the Treaty only to interference as between the trucial Chiefs themselves. The Treaty with Bahrein has wider scope. The Chief of Bahrein agrees to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description, so long as he receives the support of the British Government against similar aggres sions from the Chiefs and tribes of the Gulf; he agrees to make known to the Resident, as arbitrator, all aggressions and depredations which may be designed by sea against him; f and the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted, or in course of infliction, by sea upon Bahrein, or upon its dependencies in this Gulf. 5 We are, therefore, bound to interfere on behalf of Bahrein should any attack by sea be made or designed ; in regard to the other Chiefs, except in case of attack by one subscribing Chief upon another, our interference is matter of policy and not of obliga tion,' 10. Explicit assurances of the Porte. —On the 25th April, f Colonel Herbert reported a rumour that, if the expedition to Nejd was successful, it would eventually be directed to the acquisition of Bahrein, Muscat, and the Arab Coast. He request ed instructions. Being asked his authority for the statement, he replied that the re port now generally believed at Bagdad, and accorded with Turkish pretensions, as reported in his letter of 16th March 1870. That letter gave cover to a protest by Midhut Pasha on behalf of his Govern ment against the proceedings which Colo nel Pelly had, with the sanction of the British Government, taken a short time before at Bahrein. The Pasha stated that— Bahrein and its dependencies are countries of the Ottoman dominions, and the Government of those localities appertains to the Kaim-Makamlek of Nejd, subject to the Ottoman Government.' The protest was sent to the Secretary of State under cover of a Secret despatch No. 28 of 20th May 1870, from the Gov ernment of India, with the remarks extract- ed on the margin. On 28th April, Colonel Herbert again telegraphed as follows r telegraphs repeatedly at my request Otfl P S r 1 i ave P 08 *™ ^ranees from the Ottoman Porte that they intend establishing * Vide paragraph 8. t Pages 45-46, P ara 10.— We have already informed Your brace that any disposition to admit the pretensions fysia to supremacy over Bahrein would probably ^ ^ r viva L ot similar 0 ^olete claims on the n™ ItllY' result ' which we foresaw, has now actually been brought about; and as Your Grace Mir :; v Vr Colonel Herbert ' s ietter March which forms one of the enclosures of this despatch, His Excellency Midhut Pasha, the Governor- f'. *NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 7 (General of Bagdad, has formally claimed Bahrein and its dependencies as countries of the Ottoman dominions.

Colonel Herbert's telegram of the 25th, regarding the rumoured intentions of the expedition, was reported on 28th, to the Secretary of State, who was asked whether an assurance could not be obtained from the Turkish Government that the expedition had no other object than the settlement of the affairs of Nejd. The Secretary of State replied :— ' Her Majesty^s Government have received assu rance from Constantinople that Turkish Govern ment have no such designs as those mentioned.' To clear up the discrepancy between the imformation received from Her Majesty's Government, and that received from the Political Agent at Bagdad, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was imme diately communicated with by telegraph both direct and through Colonel Herbert. The result of this reference was that Sir H. Elliot telegraphed on the 12th May :— ' The Ottoman Porte explicitly denies all inten tion of extending supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and contemplates no attack against them. The sole object of the expedition is declared to be the restoration in Nejd of the tranquillity which is disturbed by the hostility of the brothers Sheikh Abdoollah and Sheikh Saood. I received assurances that no maritime operations are intended in the Gulf, the vessel employed being only intended is transport to convey troops to a point from which they can reach Nejd.' A detailed account of the interview on the 25th April at which the Grand Vizier communicated these assurances regarding the intentions of the Porte was forwarded by India Office despatch No. 29, dated 12th May 1871. It appears that the fol lowing memorandum* by Sir H. Elliot was communicated through Mr. Pisani to the Grand Vizier :— ' The accounts from Bagdad are to the effect that, for a considerable time past, Midhut Pasha had been endeavouring to attract the attention of the Porte to the movement going on in Nejd and the adja cent provinces. His Excellency wishes to obtain for the Ottoman Government a more real supre macy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes of South Arabia; has induced him to persuade the Porte to undertake a costly and impossible enterprise indeed, under the ostensible pretext of supporting Abdoollah, whom he has represented as Kaimakan or functionary of the Ottoman Government, of which he has hitherto maintained his perfect independence. The anxiety of Midhut Pasha to obtain the command of Bahrein and Kateef, and to establish the supremacy of the Porte over the whole of Central and Southern Arabia, has the appearance of not being untinc- tured with a growing jealousy of British influence— g nejd expedition precis m the Persian Gulf. It is too late to hope thai what I cannot but look upon as an il!-ad\ ised ex pedition will be stopped; but as any disturbance of the existing relations of the different Govern ments on the borders of the Persian Gulf will certainly not be seen with indifference by Hei Majesty^s Government^ Mr. Pisani will tell the Grand Vizier that 1 should be glad to give Lord Granville such explanations as shall re-assure them with regard to the object of it. W hen the report of am intended expedition in the Persian Gulf and Central Arabia reached me some months ago, 1 was authorized to assure Her Majesty's Government that it had no foundation. It now appears that, although at that time the Porte had no intention of sending one, the Governor-General of Bagdad had resolved upon it, and the motive was assigned to it, of the necessity of supporting the authority of a purely nominal Kaimakan, who had never before recognized that of the Porte, must necessarily be received with caution. Mr. Pisani replied:— ' I have communicated word for word to Ali Pasha Your Excellency's instruction of this day's date relative to Nejd, &amp;c. After 1 concluded. His Highness seemed excited and annoyed, and told me that all independent States are perfectly at liberty to deal with their internal affairs as circumstances may require, Nejd, he went on to say, being an integral part of the Sultan's domi nions, the Porte cannot be debarred from the exer cise of its authority over it. He contended that Abdoollah is not an absolute ruler, as supposed, but a functionary holding his appointment of Kaimakan in virtue of an imperial firman, and therefore entitled to be supported by the Govern ment against those who attack him. Your Excel lency, said Ali Pasha, may give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty's Government that the Porte entertains no intention whatever of obtain ing the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes of South Arabia, and does not contemplate any attack upon them, or harbour any design to subdue them. He asserts that the true and sole object of the present enterprise is to pacify the two brothers, to prevent the protraction of disorder, and to restore tranquillity,' 11. Midhut Pasha confirms assuran ces ol Porte. —On receipt of the above assurances from the Porte, Colonel Herbert was directed on the 17th May* to take an early opportunity, without seeking a formal interview with Midhut Pasha, of express- i?y satisfaction of the Hntish Government at the communication from the Porte. This he did and informed Governmentf that the Pasha explicitly confirmed the assurances of the Porte. 12 - Instructions to Colonel Pellv.- The receipt of the above assurances from f' en . ab led Government to give the ' r ® &lt; l uir ed instructions to Colonel 17th d S eCt ? i ' in a letter t dated c'l f v, C B ?® ba y Government, to mmunicate the substance of SirH.

With regard to the general questions put by Colonel Pelly* it was said 'he should be informed that it is impossible for His Excellency in Council to give instructions regarding- contingencies of the occurrence of which there is no immediate prospect. The Turkish expedition^ however^ in no way affects the Treaty rights and obligations either of the British Govern ment or of the Chiefs who have subscribed the maritime peace. Colonel Pelly may so inform the Chiefs who have consulted him, and should use all legitimate means to maintain the stipulations of the Treaties. 13. Report to Secretary of State with views of Government— On the 23rd Mayf Government forwarded to the Se cretary of State all the papers received up to date regarding events in Nejd and the expedition, and, after a resume of the corre spondence that had taken place, observ ed:}:— ' Although the assurances so explicitly given by the Turkish Government may for the present allay any immediate apprehensions, we think it not im probable that the expedition to Nejd may, from the force of circumstances, assume more serious proportions than the Porte at present contemplate. 'We beg to draw the attention of Your Grace to the latest letters on the subject received from the Political Agent at Bagdad. § * * These papers show the difficulties which the Turks are likely to encounter, and the complications that may arise from the prosecution of their enterprise. It is, therefore, highly desirable, both in the interest of the Porte and the peace of the Persian Gulf, that the expedition should be stopped, and if that is, as we fear, no longer feasible, that the Government of the Porte should be advised to limit its propor tions as much as possible.' A brief exposition of the British policy, as described in paragraph 9 of this Precis, was placed before the Secretary of State, with a request that the Government of India might be favored with the views of Her Majesty's Government on the subject. To this despatch no reply has been re ceived. 14. Colonel Pelly directed to proceed to Bahrein.— Colonel Pelly on the 25th May reported that the commercial classes were disturbed and anxious, and that the pearl season would be lost. He en quired whether tribes who are parties to the maritime truce were to be allowed to undertake operations by sea on the interest of either party. On the 30th May the following reply was sent him :— ' Go to Bahrein in Hugh Rose, Magpie and Bullfinch to accompany. Assure Bahrein Chief inNEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS- words of Turkish assurance* as stated m my sepa- rate telegram. Inform him that f* 'ong as he observes conditions of Articles 2 and 8 of Ireaty, onr obligations will be fulfilled. Infonn persons interested in pearl fishery that their interests w.ll be protected. Inform all Chiefs, trucial and others, that the Turkish Government contemplates no attack on them, and has no intention to obtain supremacy over any independent State. 15. Secretary of State's instructions with regard to preventing trucial Chiefs from aiding either party — With reference to Colonel Pelly s enquiry regarding trucial Chiefs, in the preceding paragraph, the Secretary ot State was asked by the Viceroy on the 30th May t ' If Pelly asks whether he is to stop by force any military operations by sea on part of Chiefs, either for or against Turks, am I to authorize him to do so ? I advise this course, and that you should inform Turkish Government accordingly. This will not include Kowait Chief, who has already sailed.' A reply I was received by telegram on the following day:— ' Persian Gulf Trucial Chiefs may be interdicted from maritime operations, but no others.' The Bombay Government were directed on the 5th June to inform Colonel Pelly ac cordingly, and to instruct him to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. 16. Pasha promises non-interference with littoral Arabs— On the 26th May Colonel Herbert was told § :— ' Ask Midhut Pasha whether any orders have been issued regarding- interference of the Chiefs or tribes on the shores of the Gulf? Have the Turks invited any of the littoral Arabs to accompany or assist them, or take part in their operations by sea ?' He replied || :— 'Pasha states Sheikh and tribe from Kowait voluntarily accompany expedition, part in merchant vessels, part by land. No communication with other littoral tribes.' 17. Porte promises non-interference with Trucial Chiefs, but claim to accept their services when offer ed .—The instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 15) to prevent Tru cial Chiefs engaging in maritime opera tions having been communicated to the Porte, Sir H. Elliot wrote on the 8th June^:— ' Aali Pasha expressed his thanks for the commu nication, and, having in unequivocal terms repeated his assurances that the Porte contemplated no naval operations, said that it had no intention of applying for assistance to any of the Chiefs in cluded in the maritime truce. At the same time, however, the Porte, having no cognizance of the * Vide paragrft|»h 10. t Page 83. X Page 90. § Page 79. Page 80. Page 114,7? NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 11 truce, could not be expected to be held bound by- it, and would not hesitate to accept the services of any of the Chiefs who might tender them.' At the instance of the India Office, Sir H. Elliot was directed by the Foreign Office* to furnish the Turkish Government with a copy of the British engagements with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf for the maintenance of the maritime peace. He was further requested to inform the Porte that the British Government intend ed to hold these Chiefs to their engage ments. Sir H. Elliot replied on the 19th July that he had already explained to the Porte the nature of the arrangements with the Chiefs upon the coast of the Persian Gulf with regard to the maritime truce, and had made it understood that Her Majesty's Government would watch over their observance. The engagements with the Chiefs contained in the State papers and ' KerIslet's Treaties' had, said the Am bassador, been communicated to the Porte, the Collection of Aitchison not being in the archives of the Embassy. 18. Observations of Midhut Pasha on the instructions given to Colonel Pelly .—The instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 12) were communi cated in writing to Midhut Pasha. Colonel Herbert telegraphed:— 'Yours of thirtieth received, and purport com municated in writing to Pasha on 31st. His Excellency replies observing that in instructions to Pelly mention is made of Treaty existing in name of British Government. He reiterates verbal communication that the object of expedition is expulsion of Saood from Kateef and Hasa, and restoration of tranquillity there; that Bahrein is not within Turkish contemplation. Expresses equal desire for protection of vessels and pearl fisheries in those waters, and states this is arranged as a duty of expedition. Expresses thanks that Pelly is instructed to assist in preserving order and tranquillity. Regarding independent tribes states, if not within Nejd, that is Abdoollah's jurisdiction, present project has and can have no connection with them; but that if any tribe, sup posed to be independent, be in Nejd, and aiding Saood and opposing the Government, although pre sent design as above stated, it will become duty of troops to punish such tribes. Declares non- - existence and impossibility of existence of such independent tribe in country of Nejd. I write by post.' 19. Expedition prohibited by Pasha from approaching Bahrein— In reply to a query whether Turkish vessels would disembark only at Kateef or De- mam, as contemplated in the previous March {vide paragraph 3), Colonel Herbert repliedf— ' Pasha states the destination of the expedition being Kateef, he has given orders to disembark13 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. the troops there, or, if necessary, at a locality close to it, which they erroneously called Ojair, name not known, and the orders having 1 been so given, the Commandant cannot act contrary to the instructions received. His Excellency does not deem necessary to issue orders prohibiting disembarkation at other ports except Bahrein, which the expedition is prohibited from approach ing.' Colonel Herbert, in a letter dated 24tli May,* writes:— ' He {i .e., Midhut Pasha) assured me his orders to the officer commanding the expedition were that he should on no account turn his eyes on Bahrein, and if invited to receive hospitality there, that he should decline such invitation.' 20. Enquiries from Persia regarding expedition— Mr. Alison on the 14th May telegraphed to Earl Granville— 'King is desirous of obtaining some assurance respecting Turkish expedition as affecting Bahrein.' In reply to this the India Office requested that the Shah might be made aware of the Grand Vizier's declarations regarding the absence of all intentions on the part of the Porte to obtain a supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, &amp;c. 21. Non-interference in political questions enjoined on Colonel Herbert. —In a telegram of the 2n(l June, Colonel Herbert informed Govern- ment:— In the ^ last number of the local Government journal eight towns of Oman, including Shargah Debay, and Abuthabi, all trucial, are enumerated in list of houses and gardens of country of Ncjd Request instructions.' Government replied f :— 'In all your commanications with Pasha conhne yourself to reminding His Excellency of the engagement given by Government not to undertake any operations hy sea beyond such as are necessary for disembarking troops and the stores for expedition, and that we hope disembarka tion may not occur at places other than where it has already commenced.

In the former letter he writes— ' It is said that the mass of the people have joined Saood, and that he is master of the country; while Abdoollah is reported to be a refugee some where to the north of the Jibil Shamar [the exact locality is not stated] with his uncle Abdoollah-ibn- Toorki, his son Toorki, and a handful of followers. ' It does not appear that any further battle has taken place. ' After the successes of Saood, as reported in * This allusion is to a previous letter ot Colonel my letter above mentioned,* the garrisons of the Herbert's dated 20th February 187J., No. 6, to the two forts of El-Hasa and of that of Kateef gave Ambassador at the Porte. U p to him these places with all the treasure con tained in them. ' Abdoollah, after his flight from Riadh, was heard of as encamped at a place called Tieb-ism, about 150 miles south-west from Sook-oos-Sheookh on the Euphrates, with a force of about the same numerical strength as that of his brother, com posed of Arabs of the tribes of the Shammar, Anezah, and El-Kahtan; but this gathering ap pears to have had no adhesion, and to have melted away, the Arabs all going over to Saood, and con sequently Abdoollah was obliged again to fly. ' It is reported that Bunder-ibn-Rashid, Sheik of the Jibil Shammar, has made his submission to Saood, sending him, in charge of his brother, an offering of 20 mares, and that he has been sum moned to attend in person, ' Sheikh Feysul left two brothers, Abdoollah-ibn- Toorki, above mentioned, and Julooi-ibn-Toorki. ' The former, as reported, is with Abdoollah, the latter is in Riadh; but he has sent his son Saood to join the new Chief, and holds Riadh in his name. ' Abdool Rchman, the fourth son of Feysul, is reported to have joined his brother Saood at El- Hasa, as also Mahboob, the former Minister of Feysul, and all the principal persons of the place. ' It is said that, on Abdoollah applying for aid to the Shereef of Mecca, the latter wrote to Bun- der-ibn-Rashid and to Sheikh Zamil, Chief oi Anezah in Kaseem, to join and support him j but both excused themselves. « Sheikh Zamil, having in former years suffered much from the oppression of Feysul and his sons, Abdoollah and Mahomed, particularly in the pro longed siege of his native city and the slaughter of many of the inhabitants about eight yeais ago, is unlikely to permit to pass the opportunity of sup porting the cause of a Chief from whom he may reasonably hope for more generous treatment. ' Saood is stated further to have nominated a friend of his own, llassun-ibn Abd-ool Mohsen, whose family has suffered terribly at the hands of Abdoollah, as Sheikh of his native city of Bareida in Kaseem in the room of Mahomed-us-Sudeeri, an adherent of Abdoollah, who has retired to Sudeer. ' It now appears that the letters from Midhut Pasha to Abdoollah, which I previously mentioned as having been sent by the Muteserif of Bussorah, contained offers of assistance and a promise to 414 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. send troops to his support if AbJoollah would des patch a confidential person to act as their guide. 'These letters, contrary to my expectation, reached their destination, and, in accordance with them, Abdoollah despatched one of his followers, named Abd-ool-Aziz Babtein, with presents con sisting 1 of horses and other things. ' This messenger was, however, plundered about two days' distance from Zobair, which place he reached on foot, and he arrived at Bagdad empty- handed on the morning of the 22nd instant/' In his letter of the 26th April,* Colonel Herbert said— ' From Nejd I have obtained no reports which I can submit as authentic, but those that have reached me state that Abdoollah has again visited Kiadh, and that, with the assistance of his uncle, Abdoollah- ibn-Toorki, he has collected together about 9,000 men. ' It is also rumoured that Saood has with him some 70,000 or 80,000 men, and that he is march ing to encounter his brother's small force. ' Should his gathering number even one-half of that stated, he will be in a position to offer a formid able resistance to the Ottoman troops, who will not number above 8,000 or 10,000 men, while the nature of the country will offer him very great advantages.' Humours from Nejd had reached Bag dad in the beginning of May f that of the 9,000 men collected by Abdoollah, the whole had deserted him on hearing that the Ottoman troop were coming into the country at his request. The feeling of the country was almost entirely with Saood. 23. Narrative of the Expeditionary force up to date of landing in Nejd.— According to Colonel Herbert's despatch ot the 24th March, J Midhut Pasha appeared at first to hesitate in supporting the sinking cause of Abdoollah, at the same time that he was inclined to support him as the Ruler or the ' Kaimu- kam' recognized by the Porte. Three days later Colonel Herbert, in consequence of a rumour that he had heard, sought an inter view with the Pasha, who, he says, ' informed me that for a long time past he had been endeavouring to attract the attention of the ,. ^ the movement going on in Neid and the adjacent provinces, and had at last obtained in- stmctions to despatch a force to aid Abdoollah, the Kaimukam nominated by the Porte. ' That this force would consist of three or four egimente, with one large gun and four or five mountain tram guns; and that he had called upon atdttht the , M0nte,ik ' Shumrmr, others, to supply contingents. Bussorfth tVlfT T 0Uld 1 be tran3 P or ted from f i [h® tioast in the corvette Bromsa the guns of which would be available and the t wo unarmed steamers Nineveh and Auur}' ^ * Pa^e 88. t PaL'f ll;» + Page 54.m- 10 *Page 60. t These were the troops engaged in the expedition against the Asseerees. X Page 61, NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 15 Midhut Pasha apparently made light of this undertaking, and was evidently not aware of the brave and warlike character of the people against whom his expedition was being despatched, as he spoke of them as nomades, and anticipated that the steam-vessels would be released in a month s time. Nor was he deterred by the expense which the Political Agent hinted would be heavy, while the treasury at Baghdad was in a very low condition. The Political Agent had, however, subse quently heard that the Pasha had received instructions to spare no expense. The Political Agent further remarked that it might be inexpedient to denude the country ol troops of which there were never more than are absolutely necessary, but this the X asha answered by saying that he expected reinforcements from Syria; and as previously conjectured bv the Political Agent, the Yemen troopsf were to take a part in the enterprise. It had, moreover, come to the knowledge of the Political Agent that troops were bein (r brought from Constantinople, and that a vessel was about to proceed to Jeddah for troops. This report had reached the Poli tical Agent ' in a manner which forbade his seeking* its con firmation from His Excellency.' A remarkable report had reached Midhut Pasha from Abdoollah, which His Excellency believed, to the effect that Saood was supported by the British Gov ernment which had sent seven vessels of war to his aid, with the view of obtaining ascendancy in Central Arabia. Concerning this the Political Agent remarked— ' There can be no doubt that there is a great wish on His Excellency's part^ and probably on the part of the Ottoman Government, to obtain com mand of Bahrein and Kateef, and to establish the supremacy of the Porte over the whole of Central and Southern Arabia; and this desire, tog-ether with a growing' jealousy of British influence in the Persian Gulf, appears to be the motive of the present action.' The latest news in this letter, although not at the time confirmed, was, that it was proposed to employ the present occasion to carry out the above object by taking permanent occupation of Nejd, a new division of the army being formed for this purpose, and by sending thither a Lieu tenant-Governor. Looking to the apparent popularity of Saood, the Political Agent, in another letter of the 11th Aprils expressed his doubts asNEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. to the wisdom of interference between the two brothers, with the view of restoring Abdoollah; and, regard being had to the nature of the eonntry in which troops would have to operate in favor of the latter, he also doubted their chance of success. And even allowing that the expedition did succeed, its effect, the Political Agent observed, would be either to replace an unpopular Ruler in lliadh, and thus pre pare the way for his overthrow by his more popular brother, or facilitate the acquisition of the country by the Ottoman Government, a measure which they desire. In either case, the Political Agent antici pated discontent among the people which would be followed by complications. The Political Agent further pointed out that, owing to a want of funds and scarcity of food, the latter due to a second year of drought, the province was not in a position to undertake a costly expedition such as the one proposed would prove. As regards the rumour about Saood receiving aid from the Indian Government, the Political Agent said it was to be regretted that the idea had taken root at Baghdad. Midhut Pasha had never, he said, mentioned the matter to him, although he had reason to believe that His Excel lency had endeavoured indirectly to ascer tain his views. But he had taken care to limit himself to saying that he had no information, and expressing his conviction that Government would not permit itself to be led to interfere in the affairs of Central Arabia. In a letter of the 26th April,* Colonel * Page 88. Herbert wrote:— ' I have the honor to report that the first detach ment of troops for the Nejd expedition, said to be one regiment of infantry, and numbering between 400 and 500 men, left this in the River Steamer Moosul on Thursday, the 20th instant. ' A portion of the artillery (without guns) and cavalry marched by land the next day; and on the 23rd idem a second detachment of infantry, considerably more numerous than the first, left in the Steamer Diyalah and her barge. ' A further detachment of troops is to go from Amarah shortly, and others will be despatched hence when the steam-boats return for their con veyance. ' The whole of the artillery and cavalry are to march by land; and the guns, ammunition, and stores are to be sent in country boats. 'A thousand horsemen are to be supplied bv the Montifik Arabs, and contingents of horse ard matchlockmen are to be formed at Zobair and koweit from the tribes in those neighbourhoods '5 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 17 The same letter represented forcibly the difficulties and dangers in store for the expedition;— On landing 1 at Kateef^ or Damaum, the troops will find themselves in the enemies^ country, and, it must be anticipated, will find great difficulty in procuring- carriage or supplies of any kind. ' From these ports their march to El-Hasa will oc( upy respectively four and three long* days, and will be under a burning sun and scorching hot wind across sandy desert where water for a large number does not exist. The few wells that are to be found at intervals, and are known only to the Arabs of the place, afford but a scanty supply of brackish water sufficient for the wants of a very limited number. ' It will be necessary, therefore, that water be carried, and this will demand so large a supply of camels as to be seemingly almost impossible. 1 he Heni-Khalid tribe who occupy this country, and of whom was Saood's mother, are probably entirely with him, as are said to be the other inhabitants of this region. 1 he difficulties of this march will unquestion ably be very great; but should they be surmounted, all the necessaries of life will be found at El-Hasa, and there the troops may establish themselves. ' Thence, however, to Riadh the route is much more formidable. ' The whole distance occupies seven or eight days'marching from morning till night, and of these four days and nights of constant wearisome exertion, with but small space of time available for rest and refreshment, must be devoted to crossing the Dahna or Red Desert, a tract so difficult in consequence of the extremely light nature of the sand, in which no firm foothold can be obtained even by camels, and in which no trace of passers is left; the entire absence of water, and the intense heat and glare is to be dreaded, and, so far as possible, avoided, even by wandering Arabs. ' Rut across this all who go from El-Hasa to Riadh must pass, and water, fuel, and every neces sary must be carried, while it is absolutely necessary to take one particular line known only to persons constantly occupied in passing to and fro, and any departure from which is destruction. ' This march will probably prove a worse enemy to encounter than the hordes of Arabs who may be expected to hang about the line (except only in the Dahna), and continually harass the troops without exposing themselves to the danger of an attack in force. ' There will also probably be great difficulty in procuring trustworthy guides, and if they be led by those bent on their destruction, their fate can be scarcely doubtful. 4 ' The sufferings of the members of this expedi tion can scarcely, under any circumstances, be otherwise than very great, and it is a painful ques tion how many may ever return. ' And while these troops are being thus sent to almost inevitable destruction, it seems that the Ottoman authorities, reckoning on success with somewhat overweening confidence, are forming# is NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. plans for their future operations, and, as I com- municated to Your Excellency yesterday by tele gram, are said to propose, after the capture ot Neid, to direct the expedition against ^ahmn, Muscat, and the Aral) coast in its whole length. The attention of the Secretary of State was drawn to the above letter ot Colonel Herbert, and he was asked by the Govern ment of India to make a representation to the Porte of the folly and danger of the expedition. This request of the Govern ment of India was communicated to the Foreign Office in England,* and it was added— ' If any further steps can be taken to convince the Turkish Government of what the \ iceroy de scribes as ' the folly and danger of the expedition,' the Duke of Argyll trusts that they may be taken with as little delay as possible.' The Foreign Office replied that it was not then considered necessary to do so. Subsequently, however. Sir H. Elliot was desired f to carry out the wishes of the t Page 108. Indian Government in this respect. On the 10th May, + Colonel Herbert + Pa g e 118 - wrote— ' Since writing on the 26th ultimo, I have paid a hurried visit to Bussorah for the purpose of seeing the preparations for the expedition, and found preparing to start with the troops the Steam Corvette Broussa, 23 guns; the hitherto unarmed steam ship Ninone, in which four guns have been placed; and old wooden guard ship the Khojah Bey, 18 guns, which was original^ built at Bussorah and has long been deemed unseaworthy; and three brigantines, also built at Bussorah, and carrying 4, 6, and 12 guns, respectively, and in little or no better condition than the Khojah Bet/.' Colonel Pelly telegraphed on the 31st May §— § Page oo. a My information is that expedition is already landed at Ras Canoora, a sandy point, 10 miles from Kateef, and that Arabs will give first impedi ment at watered date groves half way.' 24. Observations of the Grand Vi zier on the policy of the British Government. Remarks of the Government of India thereon.— The substance of a despatch No. 12, dated 11th April, from Colonel Herbert to the Ambassador at Constantinople (vide para graph 10), alluding to the merely nominal character ot Abdoollah's dependence on the Porte and deprecating Turkish inter ference in Nejd at lairs, was communicated io Aali Pasha, the Grand Vizier. M. Piaani, in a letter the Ambassador of the 11th May, |1 wrote that on receipt of .11 Fa^e lot. tins communieation 'His Highness stated that the Sultan being recognized by the whole Mahomedan population as e on y KhaUf, as such he cannot allow the jt ■ :- t NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. 19 V V 4 It 'Jtv - 1 V, m *♦ *&gt; ilN &gt; « f V- » turbulent Sheikhs to beeome masters of the keys of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina without pre judice to his dignity and to the prestige of the Khalifat, and without losing his paramount autho rity over all the Mussulmans. ' Aali Pasha declared again that the Porte enter tains no intention nor harbours any design over the independent tribes, but at the same time it cannot permit the Sheikhs to deal with their pos sessions as they please, and quoted the instance of Sheikh Saeed, who disposed of the port bearing his name in favor of a French Company for the purpose of getting a few thousand dollars, and thus placed the Porte in an awkward dilemma. ' His Highness contends that the information of Colonel Herbert that Abdoollah is an independent Sovereign is erroneous, and states that it can be easily proved by the date of the Sultanas ordin ance and the firman by which he holds his appointment of Kaimukan that he was named about eight years ago. It was not Midhut Pasha who offered to assist Abdoollah, but it is the latter who solicited the aid of the Porte. ' The Algerines, he went on to say, have not only the apparent desire to shake off the yoke of their present Ruler, but loudly proclaim their earn est wish to return to their former allegiance, though no notice is taken of their demand. ' Russia has, and still continues to subjugate provinces in Turkistan without any alleged mo tive, and her troops are fast advancing towards the Indian frontier, and not a word is uttered or any step taken to prevent their progress, which sooner or later, said His Highness, will give serious anxieties to the British Government. ' Finally, Aali Pasha observed, rather in an angry tone, that in his humble opinion it does not behove a great power like England to avail itself of the pretended weakness of the Porte to endea vour to countenance the Arabs and interfere in the internal affairs of Turkey, and which affairs are of vital importance to her. He repeated again that it may be reckoned upon that not the slightest idea is entertained of making new conquests or subduing independent tribes. The Porte's sole desire is to restore peace and tranquillity in its dominions; but so long as foreign countenance is given to those turbulent Arabs, the action of the Porte, as a matter of course, is paralyzed, and the Arabs are encouraged in their illegal acts against the Sultan's authority.' In forwarding M. Pisani's letter to Earl Granville the Ambassador observed:— • ' I have since alluded to the subject jn conver sation with the Grand Vizier, and said that, as his language to M. Pisani had seemed to indicate a suspicion that the disaffection of one section of the Arabs was countenanced by Her Majesty's Government, I could assure him that there were no grounds for any such suspicion.' 'All that Her Majesty's Government desired was that the existing state of things in South Arabia should not be disturbed, and I had merely communicated to him Colonel Herbert's despatch in order to show the opinion of an impartial and competent judge upon the impolicy of lending20 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. the weig-ht of the support of the Porte to the expelled Wahabee Chief. ' Aali Pasha replied that the whole sympathies of the Porte being- in opposition to the Wahabees, by whom they are looked upon almost as heretics, I would understand that the support which it had been found necessary to extend to their Chief could only be due to the importance of maintaining the influence of the Sultan over the Arab tribes undi minished/' With regard to the observations of the Grand Vizier, and especially to the last two paragraphs, the Government of India, in a despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 40, dated 14th July, remarked:— ' Two points in this passage it would, in our opinion be most inexpedient to pass by without notice : Ut, a i Pasha's words that no steps are being taken to prevent the progress of Russia towards the Indian frontier; and 2nd, the implication that the -British Government avails itself of the pretended weakness of the Porte to countenance the Arabs in their illegal acts against the Sultan's authority.

Ambassador at Constantinople was desired by the Secretary of State to do his best to remove any impression that might prevail at the Porte of there being a disposition on the part of the Indian Government to encourage the disaffection of the Arabs in the Persian Gulf. Sir H. Elliot replied :* ' Aali Pasha^s expressions, reported by Mr, Pisani, and commented upon by the Governor-General in his despatch to the Duke of Argyll, exhibited an irritation originating in a suspicion that Her Ma jesty's Government were disposed to question the right of the Porte to act as it thought proper in the quarrel between Abdoollah and Saood for the administration of Nejd, which he regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. ' In the subsequent conversations which I had with His Highness I had made him understand that, although we might have our own opinion of the wisdom and policy of the course that was being followed with regard to the two brothers, he need not fear any difficulties on the side of Her Majesty's Government so long as the action of the Ottoman authorities was exerted strictly within the Sultan's dominions, but that Her Majesty's Government would not see with indifference any attempt to disturb the arrangements existing with regard to the Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf. ' The assurances received from the Grand Vizier upon that point were stat'sfactory, and I believe I had entirely removed from his mind all suspicion, if it ever existed, of theie being a wish on the part of the Government of India to provoke discontent against the Government of the Sultan. ' Server Effendi, to whom I communicated yes terday the substance of Your Lordship's despatch, showed himself perfectly satisfied; but I took the opportunity of again warning him that the further avoidance of misunderstanding would depend greatly on the care shown by the leaders of the Expedition in not overstepping the legitimate limits of the Sultan's recognized dominions.' Turkish designs on Gwuttur. Hoisting of Turkish flag at Bid- deh.— Colonel Pelly on the 18th Julyf telegraphed a report that while the Gwuttur Chief excused himself, his son Jassim had promised aid and hoisted the Turkish flag on his own house. Major Smith was about to go to Gwuttur to ascertain facts. On the same day Colonel Pelly tele graphed again that Captain Lodder had visited Biddeh (Bedaa in Palgrave's map, on the east coast of the Gwuttur penin sula) and found the Turkish flag flying. A Turkish steamer had come in with a boat of the Koweit Chief's which it had sent to the Biddeh Chief with a command to hoist the flag. On receipt of Captain Lodder's report Colonel Pelly apparently telegraphed to Colonel Herbert asking whether the Pasha knew of or had autho rized this proceeding, for he (Colonel Pelly)22 NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS. on the following day reported a statement of Colonel Herbert's, who said— ' Pasha states that being without news, he cannot say i£ flag's have been sent to Gwuttur. Firmans, being orders emanating from Sultan, have not been sent thither.' The allusion to firmans was not intelligi ble at the time, but from Colonel Herbert's letter of the 19th July,* containing a more * Page detailed account of his interview with the Pasha, it appears that the bearer of the flag to the Biddeh Chief was supposed by Colonel Pelly to have had the authority of a firman from the Sultan. The Pasha's denial then came to this that no orders bearing the Sultan's signature had been sent demanding the fealty of the Gwuttur Chief. It was not clear whether the steamer that had arrived off Biddeh was a Turkish man-of-war or merchant vessel, and Colonel Pelly was directed by the Government of India to obtain full inform ation on the point. On the 30th July Colonel Pelly intimated— 'Herbert having addressed Bagdad Pasha con cerning Turkish flag at Gwuttur, latter replied his assurance had related to Bahrein, which would not be interfered with until settlement of question between British and Ottoman Governments; but that Gwuttur was not excepted like Bahrein 'f t Page 140. As already mentioned in paragraph 21, Colonel Herbert had been directed to make no communication on political mat ters to the Pasha. Pie was again reminded of these instructions and told— 'except under direct instructions from Govern ment of India, make no communication to Pasha on questions involving political or international principles, or Treaty rights and duties. Report constantly by telegraph and ask for orders.'^ + p^e 147. Colonol Pelly was also directed through the Bombay Government to ' make no direct communications to Colonel Her bert on matters involving political or international principles or Treaty rights and duties. Such mat ters should be referred to Government of India by whom communication will be made with the Porte through the proper channel/^ § Pa ^, u7 Later, on the 30th July, the followin 0, was received from ColonerPelly 'Magpie arrived Major Smith found Turkishll II The Owuttur Chief. house - Arab in Bin Thanni's Turkl fl twiltt ' lr .

Turkish Government steamer and Chief of Koweit in his own boat proceeded to Gwuttur bearing com munication from the Pasha Commanding Ottoman forces in Nejd.''* The Assistant Political Resident wrote on the 20th Julyf regarding the Gwuttur Chief— ' Mahomed bin Tani ; although heretofore well enough inclined, is old and infirm, and is influenced by his son Jassim with whom the pirate Nasir bin Moobarek is closely allied: both these men, it is known, hate the policy hitherto maintained in the Gulf. They have long set their minds on pirating Bahrein, hence the reception with pleasure of a flag that rightly or wrongly they suppose may yet afford them the desired opportunity.^ In a letter^ to the Assistant Political Resident, the Gwuttur Chief siffnificantlv wrote— ' We are people residing on the mainland and their (Turk's) forces are moving by land, and I have been required to accept this flag, I there fore did so.' The Gwuttur Chief gave§ as a reason for flying the Turkish flag that he had not been protected by the English. This allu sion was to the piracy of one of his boats by another tribe, for which he complained that he got no redress. Colonel Pelly said|| that the matter had been enquired into. The bearing of these events at Biddeh will be best illustrated by the following extract from the Foreign Secretary's note of the 19th July 1871:— ' Some notice of Biddeh or El Biddeh will be found at the places I have marked in No. XXIV. of the new series of Bombay Selections. It will be seen that, as early at any rate as 1827, and as late as 1851, it is described as a dependency of Bahrein. Whether it is so still I have no inform ation, but at all events nothing is known here to the contrary. Esau bin Tarif, who settled with a section of the Uttobee tribe there, was a descen dant of one of the original Uttobee conquerors of Bahrein. It will be remembered that the present Bahrein family originally came from Koweit, hence perhaps the attempt to establish Turkish supremacy over Biddeh. ' Biddeh, it will be seen, is on the eastern side of the Gwuttur Promontory, a place to which the requirements of the Nejd Expedition can in no way require the Turkish vessels to go. The occupation of it seems to be quite contrary to the spirit of the assurances given both by the Porte and the Pasha. It is no doubt the first step towards the establish ment of supremacy over the tribes to the east, whose towns. His Excellency will remember, have been entered in the local Turkish Gazette^ as being houses and gardens of the country of Nejd. The Turks are too cunning to make any violent and sudden assertion of their supremacy over these regions. There is first the insinuation of the Pasha that the assurances given refer to independent tribes, of whom there can be none in Nejd;** then the entry in official papers of certain places as</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000122_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B99</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000122</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B99</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'NEJD EXPEDITION PRECIS.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1872/1872</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-08T14:33:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (42 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this description commences at folio 66 and terminates at folio 98, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
