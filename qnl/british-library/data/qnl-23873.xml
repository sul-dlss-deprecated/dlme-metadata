For the benefit of cinema-goers the following revised alternative schedules are being put into effect and will be followed whenever practicable throughout the winter. The schedules are designed to give the maximum number of days whereon film shows will be at the same hour irrespective of the number of films available per week. Normally on3.y two films per week are scheduled, however with the irregular arrival of films, the additional standby film each month, the occasional ♦spot booking* of locally available programmes, together with the necessity of expediting screening as soon as films are receive ed here, three films per week may be expected from time to time. Iu is hoped that the timings shown below will prove acceptable to all club members and will by being so arranged, enable them to fit in other club activities scheduled for the same evenings.

The programmes are lists, indicating the date and time of screenings, venue and audience (for example: students, girl students, public, policemen). No details of the films shown are given;throughout the file, programmes of ‘movies’ scheduled to be shown at the BAPCO (Bahrain Petroleum Company) Club at Awali. The programmes indicate the date and time of screenings, film titles, principal actors, and film production companies. Most of the films are Hollywood productions, with a small number of British-made films also shown. Some films are preceded by newsreels and factual short films. Many film titles indicate subject matter that reflects the era in which they were produced (during and immediately after the Second World War), such as Laurel and Hardy’s
                              Air Raid Wardensand a short screened in February 1946 entitled
                              What to do with Germany;a single programme, dated September 1946, for the station cinema at the Royal Air Force (RAF) base at Muharraq (f 49).Interspersed with the programmes is a small amount of correspondence (from the BAPCO Club, the Naval Officer in Charge at Bahrain, RAF Bahrain) relating to cinema screenings and programmes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>BAPCO Club</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Cinema</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Public Relations Officer, Persian Gulf, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Timetables</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000136#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
