Headquarters, Savoy Hotel, Cairo. 16th May, 1916. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that in consequence of a written request from the Sultan of Maskat, Sayed Mohammed Rashid xiida has applied to me for permission to send a Muhammedan tutor to Maskat for the purpose of instructing the Sultan’s son. A reply has been given that such an appointment rests entirely with the Indian Government and that the Egyptian authorities can do nothing beyond forwarding his request and facilitating the arrangement, if sanctioned. Sayed Mohammed Rashid Kida is, as you are doubtless aware, the Editor of the well 'known religious/paper 'El Manar' and a | prominent member of the Arab Decentralization Party. He is known to be strongly opposed to the Turks and there is every reason to believe that his political aspirations are not in conflict with the policy of H.b.M’s Government. I am therefore forwarding his request, and if the appoint ment were sanctioned in principle, I would of course satisfy myself of the character and qualifications of his nominee. I have, etc,, Sd/- G.

H.H. the Sultan has only one son, a boy about six B- years of are * who is small &amp; backward, but gives promise of a gOv.d intelligence. H.H. is anxious that a tutor for toe iau sLeuaa oe obtained from Egypt, l. he wrote to Bayed Mohammad Rashid Hi da, editor of the newspaper call.ed “HI Munar', at Cairo, to get him a suitable man. She reason alleged by the Sultan in conversation wiuh me to explain Lis predilection for an Egyptian was that he eonoid- and ere a Egyptians to be better educated to i*.ave more m od ern i ..eas than Indians. He said that h- was especially desirous of finding a tutor who could instruct his sen in the principles of natural od- &gt; ence. But H.H.*s Cvvn education is so limited that I hesitate to credit him with the possession of strong views as to the value of : / a curriculum of which he knows nothing beyond the mere name. In my opinion the real reason is that H.H. feels that am Egyptian eould he mere likely to speak k write good Arabic, k to be m touch wxta Arab sentiment than a man from India, k I think that he attaches more weight to these qualifications than to familiar 11 ^&lt; *ii vu decide fern science. It is for the Government of India to tmy whether the?v.e inculcation of Egyptian, or perhaps one should say pan-Aracian, ideals in the mind of the Sultan's son is undesirable or not. L your endorsement I was ashed to express my own views, X venture ,to state that, in my judgement, it would be well to let the Sultan have his way, provided that the Egyptian authorities exercise dis cretion in controlling the choice of a tutor who will fulfil his task satisfactorily. 3 ). H.H. was reluctant to tell me wliat salary offered, saying that his agent in Cairo would arrange these matters, but it is important that the tutor should have a clear agre ment on this | p 0 int. H.H.'s finances are in a bad way &amp; are going from bad to worse. 4) The delay in answering this reference is due, first to H.H.'s inability to dispose of business during 8 the fast of Ramadan, &amp; second, to his prolonged absence from the capital since the Id. 5) .

Private. My dear Grant, A few weeks ago I wrote to you about a pro posal (mentioned in Bombay Government proceedings) that the Sultan of Muscat should get a tutor for his son from Egypt through Reshid Riza. Prom a report of Howell ! s dated 16th October 1916 it would seem that negociations with Egypt are still in progress. It may therefore be useful if I enclose 3 extracts from recent reports illustrating the goings-on of Reshid Riza in Mecca. The nominee of such a person, in touch with Saiyid Radir, might surely be a con siderable potential danger. Sd/- A.Hirtzel. 98-11-16. To The Hon *1)16 Mr. A.H.Grant,C ,S.I. ,C.I .F., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Extract from notes by Colonel Wilson, October 1916. xxx x Hussein Ruhi informs me that Ahmed Rida is very friendly with the French Mission and that he has an Agent who sleeps outside.JS, outside the Mission tent who heard Rida tell the French that everybody in Egypt loathes the British and how overjoyed the Syrians were at the French joining the Arab movement as their Friend, etc. Ruhi also reports that Rida has been secpetly distri buting pamphlets in Mecca which are said to be very fana tical and calculated to inflame Moslems against Christians; that he is working against the British influence and the Sherif is very annoyed at his presence. Extract txaifl report on Mecca by Hussein Ruhi Effendi,0ctr.l91‘; Sheikh Rashid Rida made a speech also to the public in the presence of the Sherif. The former spoke politely at first about the movement of the Arabs and the cause of the Sherif, but when he began to deal with religious questions and say that all Mohammedans should do their best to destroy Christianity, etc. His Highness the Sherif stopped him at once by putting his fingers at Rashid Rida's mouth. The Sherif has told me that he was not pleased with Rashid Rida because the latter was a Wahab i, and that he had given a pamphlet to some people in which he stirred the feelings of the Moslems against the Christians. I tried without si'ccess to get hold of one of these pamphlets. On Tuesday the 3rd of the Kurban Bairarc, Rashid Rida came early in the morning to the tent of the French Mission at Muna and began, on being questioned about Egypt and the English policy there, to say 'none of the Egyptians like the English, as they rob the wealth of the Egyptians ready to do anything France may want me to do in Egypt because X know all about the English policy there and I will do any service, political or otherwise.

From R # E*L.Winsate Esq. I.C,S« Political Asent and H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat. To The Deputy political Resident, Busnire* Sir I have the honour to refer to the question of the future education anl training of Sayid Said bin Teimur. the son of H.H.Sayld Telraur bin Palsal, Sultan of Muscat and the heir to tne Sultanate* In my secret letter No.898 dated the 38th April 1930 I had touched upon tala question, and had advocated that Sayid Said should be sent to a Chiefs' College in India in the event of my recommendations contained In the above letter being accepted. It is I think however incontrovertible that even in the event of the policy which I have outlined not being adopted by Government, the education of his son in a manner befitting his future stafon and responsibilities is a subject of urgent and paramount importance. The Sultans of Muscat in the past an tue resent Sultan have been completely uneducated. This in rabia is not an unusual state of affairs, but it is .hat it has seldom reached the absurd position which it has Muscat. It is a melancholy fact that it was only a few rears ago that the present Sultan learned to read and writ., die brothers are in little better state and some are quite Illiterate. Brought^as they are among the women in the aideous nosltlon and climate of Muscat. It Is little to be wtndered at that at a v„ry early age they develop Into the n ost useless and vicious types of degenerates, possessed of childish ideas of their own Importance, difficult to deal with, a justifiable cause of annoyance to the tribes of theinterior, and a continuous drain on the slender purse of the jo state* In the cases of tne Sultans themselves inis almost complete lack of education has made them the tools of unscrupulous ministers arid courtiers, has deprived them of all power over or respect from their people and has without doubt made them both suspicious and difficult to deal with. It is perhaps permissible here/to refer to what (fa I is now admitted policy with regard to Mus6at, which is to A make the state and the ruler sufficiently strong to do without continual propping and interference from us* Efforts to put the administration on a sounder footing are being made, but the whole structure will fall to the ground later if we cannot supply a head of the state who will be the nead &gt;1 the state and who will command respect from his qualities and will endeavour to fulfill his responsibilities through iiis training For reasons which I have pointed out else- -where the hope of the state lies In Sayld Said, the son of the Sultan* He is an intelligent and excellent mannered little boy of eight to ten years old, who can- read and write Arabic and w'o£ is as yet uncorrupted by Ms horrible surroundings. In tne healthy atmosphere and surroundings of A Chiefs’ College such as the Mayo College at Ajmer© he would have a very fine chance of developing into a useful member of society. The boy himself has for long been anxious to go to school and has spoken to me on the subject. I had intended to broach the subject to the Sultan immediately on his return, but as tMs has been delayed I took the opportunity of asking the wazir Captain Maceollum who would be passing through Karachi on leave to open the question with the Sultan* I have today received a wire from Captain MaccoHum that the Sultan agrees to sending Ms son to a CMefs’ College and hopes that the Political Agent will nelp to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible. 1 hone that the wishes of the Sultan will commend themselves to your approval. I an mx is that ^®i£p£. should be taken at once If possible to enable 3ayld V P.. £ 4-, Said to a college next terra. If I nay venture a personal .,pinion it is that nothing but good can. come from such a stop. from the point of view of climate, nearness to Muscat and other reasons I would suggest Ajmere as the most suitable place. ^h.e state will provide any nocossary allowances wnich the principal of the College should think necessary for hie position. He would take with him servants from here, but It i h v^ry doubtful if there is any -person from the state who 14% qualified in any way to act as hie guardian. For this reason I would advocate his being put under the personal care of on© of the English masters* In view of p ssible delay I am aending a copy of this letter to the Secretary to the Government of IndJ.a in the Foreign and Political .Department In addition to tm Civil Commission or, Baghdad* I would request that t.* tnis proposal la approval I may be Informed by Ul.sr.pb and «iat that th# GovemMent of India will requaet the Principal of Chiefs 1 College at Ajmere to complete all necessary arrange- Client b in direct correspondence with me.

They are of course well up in Arabic literature and grammar, but do not know the spoken language.

During his stay at Muscat he would with his previous knowledge be able to pick up quite enough of the spoken language to caryy on with.

Such beinf; the case I recommend that the question ol Sayid Saeed’s future education receive very careful con sideration. 2 His Highness would prefer that his son should proceed ifor one year to some sc ho o l I n Cairo selected by the British Government. Me prefers this to the alternative of a school in Baghdad as he considers that Cairo being the intellectual hub of the Mahomedan world, offers a more broadening education than the comparative parochialism of Baghdad. If however the British Oovernment would prefer a. Baghdad education to that offered by Cairo His Highness says he is • - * ' ! willing to bow to their decision. His Highness informs me that the curriculum at nayo College permits of a pupil leaving the school most suitably in December and he would accordingly like to withdraw his next Christmas.

Itis Highness is of course right in considering Cairo as superior to Baghdad from a M&amp;homedan educational point of view, hut the anti British tendencies of certain powerful elements in &lt; the Egyptian capital may lead Government to decide that it is not a suitable place of residence for the probable heir to the Mueoat Sultanate. For this reason I think a more suitable school would probably be found in Baghdad. Say id Saeed who was born on 13 th August 1910 has now reached an age at which I think he ma* suitably receive a more specialised instruction in the language, history and literature of the Arabs than he can he expected to obtain at a College designed primarily for the education of the sons of Indian rulers.

According to the programme Hr. Thomas has sent me they will not he hack in Muscat till 15th June. The Sultan has settled some tribal quarrels at Melba and Puj air a, and Mr. Thomas has auctioned two Zakat farms anu established 4 new Customs posts, the fruits of which he hopes to gather in about 6 months' time. Mr. Thomas tells me that the Sultan does no ^ e..hc ,..t kindly to the idea of Beyrout College for Said Speed's cdu- eation. He says it does not satisfy the paramount consider ation of giving Sayid Saeed an 'Arabic education. r-n +hp n 1 r(rumstances it would appear oO be jj^efe.. &gt; get into touch with an Arab school in Baghdad.

The Hon'ble the Political Resident wishes you, however, to suggest to Mr.Thomas that he should try and persuade His Highness to send his son to Beirut, if possible, as it is reported to be an excellent school, where Arabic is taught, and no attempt is made to convert the boys.

In continuation of the previous correspondence on the subject of the education of Saiyid Saeed son of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter which I have just received from His Highness. In this letter His Highness sets out his wishes in detail. Alter several, conversations with His Highness on the subject.I have formed the opinion that he is so opposed to the suggestion of sending his son to Beyrout School that ito would be better to drop it and to endeavour to find a suitable school in Bagudad. 2. It will be seen that His Highness is prepared to keep Saiyid Saeed at the Mayo College till the end of the scnool year and wishes to send him thereafter to an Arab school for one year only to complete Ms Arabic education.

In confirmation of the conversation which took place at our interviews at Karachi I say that ^'last reply *h is that we do not wish to send our son to the_ Bey rout school, and it is not possible to accept this? proposal. We wish that our son should go to one of the High schools in Bgypt. This is our chief desire. But if there is no school there.under the supervision of the British Govt, ^ nd if jto ( ) wi.13 -*c-t contrary to **kkx the views of the Political Officers, then no matter, we will not send him to Egypt on this condition. Then we agree to send him to Baghdad. K* Our object in sending him to an Arabic Schol is to complete his Arabic lessons with grammar for a year only. We have explained to you our views about his leaving the Ajmere school. It rests w on the opinion of the ****** Principal ( of Mayo College) Ajmere. Y ou too agree to this view. If the Principal does not see it advisable take away the boy from the school in the month of December 11926. and it is better to get his discharge in April 1927^ .then no matter, we'agree to the proposal. We have no objection to that, hut on condition that the Govt permits K h an Bahadur Saiyid Siddiq Hasan to accompany the boy till April 1.27. Nodoubt that the Govt will allow that. H is not hidden to you that we require his services till then. But after the boy is discharged from the Ajmere school and is sent to an Arabic adiool. « .1U '' X trust and whose companionship « you will ppvV\ ^e have firm hope that you will submit our request to future our friend the Govt of Great Britain about the tetXK/ of Khan Bahadur Saiyid Siddiq Hasan, after his return from our service where he was deputed temporarily to accompany our son during his stay at the Ajmere school,. We request and wish that he may return to a post inside India. It is not hidden from you that he complains of loss. We c about it. ask your help and that of the Political Resident,Bushire. In the end we wish that the friendship and love between the parties may perpetuate. Sd/ TABiiUR. m r m- XJTo• 332-S of 1926. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 10th August 1926.

Initially, the Sultan was keen on getting an Egyptian tutor to be recommended by Muhammad Rashid Rida, a well-known Muslim thinker in Egypt at the time. As British officials were against the idea, they arranged for Sa‘id to be sent to Mayo College in Ajmer, India between 1922-1927. In 1926, the Sultan insisted that his son should be sent to an Arab country where he can improve his Arabic. Suggestions were made to send him either to the American University of Beirut (AUB) or to a school in Baghdad. Later on, in September 1927 Sa‘id started his school in Baghdad.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Taymūr bin Fayṣal Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Education</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00028f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
