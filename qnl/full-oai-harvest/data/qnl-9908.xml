The file largely consists of correspondence between British officials regarding several specific incidents, including one case in which a Kuwaiti dhow was reportedly seized by a Persian warship (the
                           Babr) off Henjam [Henjān], and towed to Bandar Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās]. Much of the correspondence surrounding this case and others is concerned with establishing whether or not the incidents occurred within Persian territorial waters.The file discusses more generally the British perspective regarding the extent of Persia's territorial waters and the Persian Navy's right to stop and search foreign vessels in the Gulf. Also included are instructions from the Admiralty regarding the attitude that should be adopted by His Majesty's ships in the Gulf in response to incidents of interference by Persian vessels.The principal correspondents are the following:Political Agent, Kuwait;Political Resident in the Persian Gulf;British Minister, Tehran (later referred to as His Majesty's Ambassador, Tehran);British Chargé d'Affaires, Tehran;Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir As-Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ];Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs;Foreign Office;India Office;Admiralty;Persian [Iranian] Ministry of Foreign Affairs;Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.Some of the correspondence dating from after 1935 refers to 'Iranian' rather than 'Persian' vessels, presumably in response to the Iranian Government's request for the international community to refer to the state by its historical name.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
