The Ottoman Turks rose into power about the middle of the 15th century. They seized Constantinople in 1453 and in a few years overran South-east ern Europe, Syria and Egypt, and created powerful fleets which, on the one side, obtained full command over the Indian seas, and on the other threatened to subjugate the whole Mediterranean basin. But the wave of her conquests in the West was turned back by the victories of the combined fleets of Spain, Venice and other Italian states ; while in the east a power, having its birth in the small kingdom in the extreme west of Europe, fresh from her victories in her crusades against the Moors that had established themselves in the Ibemn Pen- ninsula, turned their enterprise against theMussalman dominion in the Eastern seas and turned the flank of Islam in its grapple with Christendom. Actuated by the spirit of the crusaders, the Portuguese pursued the Moors (as they called all Mahomedans) and all who traded with them, with barbaric and reientless ferocity, and established like the Phoenicians of old factories at every imj or- tunt port in the Eastern seas. To secure their command over the Indian seas, the Portuguese knew that they should obtain a bold on the Persian Gulf. They accordingly attacked and captured Ormuz, Maskat, Bahrein and other important places and established their factories at every important town in the Persian Gulf. The Ottoman Sultans had exercised a nominal gw^m-political and religious control over Arabia. Whatever power they enjoyed on the eastern coast of Arabia they lost on the establishment of the Portuguese power in the Gulf. With the decline of the Portuguese Empire, the Persians and the Sultans of Maskat made ineffective efforts to establish their supremacy on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, only to let loose the marauding spirit of the Bedouin Arabs in the shape of piratical enterprises. The British Government then stepped iu to restore order and peace in the Gulf. But with the rise of the Wahabi power in Arabia at the commencement of the 19th century, a new element of disorder was introduced. While the British were checking these disorders in the sea, the Ottoman Government, as the protector of Islam against the aggres sion of Wahabism, despatched expeditions from Egypt to destroy the new-born aggressive power. It was crushed only to revive soon with greater vitality. The Wahabi Amirs had learnt, however, to be wise by experience and with the object of pursuing their designs of aggrandizement undisturbed, they chose to acknowledge the Sultan as their suzerain, although the vassalage was merely nominal. But it soon furnished the Porte with an excuse to meddle in Arabian affairs, when its chieftains foolishly engaged themselves in internecine wars, and to gradually extend its power in the peninsula, which at the same time served as a counterpoise against the decline of its power in the west. The conquest of Hasa and Katif districts was the result of this move. The Turks sought to extend their power still to the south by right of the privilege of the Sultan, as the religious head of the Sunni Mussalman Church or what may be called Holy Ottoman Empire, or as the suzerain of the Nejd principality, although the Nejd Amirs never welcomed this expansion of the Turkish power. The Turkish dominion is admittedly established in the Hasa and Katif districts. The Turks, however, have not established an effective Jh.old over the tribes in their newly-acquired districts, so as to be able to preserve order and peace among them. On the contrary the introduction of the Turkish element has only given a fresh impetus to disorders in the interior and disturbances on the sea. The Katif coast has in fact turned into a piratical stronghold in place of what was formerly called the Pirate Coast, a little to the south of it, which has now been converted, under the British control, into one of the most peaceful districts in the Arabian peninsula. The Turkish Government has never taken any efficient measures to suppress piracies and enforce order and peace on this New Pirate Coast, This precis deals accordingly with the extension of the Turkish dominion on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf iu the nineteenth century, the [C967FD]2 causes that led to it, its results, the objects of the Turkish ambition on that coast, and the measures taken by the British Government to check the Turkish aggressive policy. An account of piracies on the New Pirate Coast finds naturally a large place in these notes. , ^ e Turkish claims to Bahrein and Katar are treated in more detail in the Bahrein Precis (1854-1904) and Katar Precis (1873-1904). + J n ?P^? n ^ ec ^ ara ^ on s of rights or policy and assurances are, it may be noted, italicized. J 25th November 1904. j t a. SALDANA.CHAPTER PIUST. Early History of Hasa and Kalif. 1. The history of Hasa and Katif has a peculiarity of its own, which Peculiar features of- distinguishes it from that of Nejd or Hejaj. Its ports—Grane, Hasa, Katif, Ojair, with those of the Bnhrein, island attracted from the most ancient times the commerce of the world. 'J he earliest settlers in the districts so far known to us were the Arabs of the Kahtanic tribe. In the early ages also tribes hailing from Chaldea found a welcome home on these coasts. It is well known that after the destruction of Babylon by the Persians, a large body of Chaldeans sailed away from their home and founded a colony at Gerrha, which is supposed by some scholars to be surviving in the village Gerryah, near Katif, and by others Jerahi near Koweit. The Persians also settled on this coast, as merchants, especially in the towns. The Indian traders were found in Katif in very early ages ; as they are found in large numbers now-a-days. There has thus grown up a population on the roast with commercial instincts largely developed, in marked contrast with the Nejdeans, as much superior to the latter in intelligence, as they are inferior to them in military qualities and physical powers. References by Arab writers, , 2 - Arabian geographers refer frequently to the coast or Katir. Yacut for instance mentions the following places : Supposed by Rawlinson* to be the Atta of Ptolmey, the coast »ride his notes, page 225 of Vol. xn opposite to Bahrein. But it is possible it of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic refers to Koweit. There was a large trade fcociety. between El-Khatt and India during the early ages of Islam, in so-much that the spears used throughout Arabia, being formed of Indian bamboos landed at that place, were known as Ramah-el- Khattyeh. JEl-EaHf. —The principal port of the Katif coast. Al-Arret. —The ancient another name of the island of Moharrak, one of sister islands of Bahrein. Hajar. —Another name of the island of Bahrein and the coast opposite to it. Darin. —The present Darin, a town north of Hasa. 3. Ibn Hawkal gives the names of the cities of Bahrein as, Hajar, El- Katif, JEl- Uqueir (Oj^ir), Bisheh and El-Khar j, while he describrs Awtl as the name of the island, belonging to Abu-Said and Salimanbin El-Hassan, the famous Carmathian leaders, who levied an enormous tribute from the ships which traded there. 4. The first known Arab colonists of Hasa and Kafif from the land side Ilrst known Arab Colonists. a f ^F P ^l\ ^ Pal S ra I e t0 TT ha . ve J; 6 ' 1 the Beni'Khahd and Bern Hapr, both Kahtanic tribes, between whom and Islaemitic tribes there were always feuds. To these elements were added the family of Eezarah, banished from Nejd, and the clans of Kelb, Beli, Tenuk and of Kodaa, who had little sympathy w r ith the tribes of Nejd. Mahomedanism was never welcomed by the Arab tribes, and what they received under force was a thin veneer of Islamism. In the beginning of the 10th century of our era the tribes of Hasa joined the famous El-Karmut, the founder of the Carmathian sect, and took a leading part in those devastating wars which sealed the downfall of Mohamedanism throughout the two-thirds of Arabia. The result was, as described by Palgrave, [C067ED] Aw r Early referenoes in our records. •Page 254, of Bombay Political partment, Volume 51 of 1821. that this district remainod permanently estranged from Islam, a heap oF moral and religious ruins, of Carmathian and esoteric doctrines, where.naturalism, to use a modern phrase for a very old thing, and materialism were mixed up and confused with Shiyai transmigrations and incarnations, with the now reviving relics of Sabaeisrn and with the fatichism common among the lower and un educated classes all over the globe, though it may vary in form and name. 5. When Niebuhr visited the Persian Gulf, he found the whole district dominated by the Beni Klialid, who have since declined in power and are supposed now to be incorporated between Rus-al-Gbar and Koweit with the A1 Ajmau (Persian Gulf Pilot). 6. The earliest mention of the Kafif and Hasa coasts in our records is contained in Major Colebrook's report De- about the Persian Gulf littoral dated 10th September* 1820. 'We shall extract his account of this const as also of the neighbouring Islands including Bahrein, as the tribes inhabiting them had once intimate connections with one another, which it would be well to note, and a description of the state of things in 1820 is well worth comparing with the existing state. Katif. —Katif is situated within a deep Khoor or bay, the approach to which is renderpd difficult by the shallow water extending along the coasts to the westward and southward of Bahrein, The chfinnel o£ entrance to Katif is by the north side o£ the Bay, and commanded by tbe insulated Fort of Damanm erected by Rama bin Jauber. Near the hnad of the Bay is the Island of Taroot inhabited by fishermen and cultivators of the date. Tbe town of Katif is defended by a fort composed of the common Arab watch towers con nected by walls, with a long face to the sea. A citadel, (the original fort) defends the north angle, and contains a spring of fresh water. There are about 20 old guns of different calibres in Katif and 8 in Taro t. Damaum Island is surrounded by unconnected watch towers similar to those at Ul-Kumra, near Rasulkeima. The population of Katif has been estimated at 25,000, but the chief part of them are connected with the Bahreinese, an un- wanike race of Sheas, who have been for some generations in subjection to their more 'martial neighbours. They pay a tax called J eh and, the price of exemption from military service. The armed population of Katif and Taroot, have been reckoned at 10 } 000, accordino- to detailed estimation at 9,000. They are of the tribe of whom 2,000 (the Beai Asseyn) are horsemen 1,500. (They) were subsidized by Abdullah bin Saud, and employed m his wars. They are all on occasions mounted (excepting 1,500 the Awazien) and retire annually to Zihaya, Mecca and Hodiedah, residing at Katit in the date season, viz., from May to December or January. Fresh water at Katif is abundant and the source of great fertility. Bahrein.— prinoipd of these Islands, called also Awal, is the residence of the elder Sheikh Solyman bin Achmed. In the smaller Island of Arad, resides Abdullah bin Achmed who is charged with the defence of their possessions. These Islands are separated by a channel 8 miles broad, which is a complete bed of shoals, at half tide requiring a pilot for a boat drawing two feet water. The seaport towns oi Manawa ani Mahurrug are opposite to each • The latter the most populous, other. i»Ianawa in Bahrein, Mahurrug in Arad ♦ 1 bey are fortified with towers, walls and ditches, and contain each from forty to fifty old guns. Manawa is open to the sea. Mahurruo- besides its walls is defended by a stone Ghurry, on a sandy point commanding the channel. 'These towns though near the shores are difficult of approach ; vessels of burthen,' anchor at a mile or £ distance. In the centre of Bahrein is the Fort of Ruffa where the Sheikh resides. This Island is fertile and productive. Water supplied from the interior but said to be unwholesome in the autumn and spring. Arad is sterile and supplied with water from sub ma rme springs. It might be un tenable it this resource were cut off. Near Mahur rug is a deep Khoor or cove called Sai, in which are eight fathoms water. These Islands are ia subjection to the Khalifah branch of the Utubi tribe, who are variously estimated from 13 000 to 19,000 armed men. The probable estimate may of Names of tribes incorporated with the Utubis Bahrein Khalifah (family of the Sheikh) : — Bokuara ul Zayd, ul Sulatta, ul Bahauain, ul Sjitid, ul Mahaudi, ul Man an*, ul Salain Maodi, Zeayni, ulYusif, Hooshboog, Ba bummait, numerous — some at Nahon and Fureiheh.

Zobarah. -On the coast, is dependant on Bahrein, protected by a tower and occnoied at present merely for the security of fishermen that frequent it. The Utubis were once coUeoti- vely established at Zobarah.

Limel Yusvee and Roes, have Khoors or back waters, which are shallow. Batils can enter at high tide, but at low water they are quite dry, and the sea coast very shallow. Yusvee has a square Ghurry and fresh water.

The tranquil lity restored to the Gulf, will probably cause all these places to be reoccupied, the coast being well watered, which is not the case in Bahrein. Guttur. —Or Ul Buddee once a considerable town, is protected by two square Ghurries, near the sea shore ; but containing no tresh water they are incapable of defence except against sudden incursions of Bedouins, another Ghurry is situated two miles inland and has fresh water with it. This could contain 200 men. There are remaining nt Ul Buddee about 250 men, but the original inhabitants, who may be expected to return from Bahrein, will augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men, 6-A. The last five places are situated within the Katar peninsula, but may be noticed here on account of their intimate connection with the history of Hasa and Katif and the Turkish movements. The town of Katif appears from Brucks' Memoir of Persian Gulf (page 571, Bombay Selection No. 24), to have belonged in the early part of the 19th century to the Chief of Benis Khalid. The sphere of this chief's influence seems to have extended even as far north as Has Moosalami where the Beni Khalid Sheikhs acknowledged his authority.4 CHAPTER SECOND. Conquest of Hasa by the Waliabis and Turkish expeditions into Nejd and Hasa, and their results 1800—1885. 7. On the rise of Wahabism in Nejd, the Arabs of tho coast from Ojair Conquest by Wahabis, 1800. to Katif had to yield their independence ■ » i j ' , , , to the Amir of ISejd. It was Abdul Aziz that first invaded the country. He took Katif by storm and made a sreat slaughter of the inhabitants, occupied Bahrein and the adjacent islands of the rersian Gulf. This took place in the year 1S00. 8. I he concjuests of the Wahabis in Hejaj in 1801, and their subsequent Turkish Expeditions of 1811—19. outiages brought down the Turkish Gov- ernment on them. It was from E^vpt that the expedition was led against Nejd, with the result that the political power of the Wahabis was crushed for a time. The Wahabik rose a^ain into power, but only to court another Turkish expedition into Nejd, and ultimately to compel their Amir to acknowledge the Sultan of Turkey as his Suzerain As it is on these conquests of Nejd and the reduction of it to vassalage, that the 1 or } e ma ! ul y based its claim to interfere in Nejd affairs in 1871. to car^e out a portion of -Arabia on the Persian Gulf as its territory, and to claim even sovereignty to the Island of Bahrein, we might narrate a few details of the two earlier lurkish expeditions. 9. J he task of punishing the Wahabis was committed by the Turkish A.D .isii'. Government to the able Viceroy of isn a j i i f-gjP'. Mahomed Aii Pasha, who in tlie year 1811 despatched an army under his son Tousoun Pasha. Mecca was rtoorered from the Wahabis without any resistance. The Amir Saud ItT n 3r : 00 ' ected f force of ] 5.000 men under the command of his son Abdullah and on the army of Tousoun Pasha advancing further inland it was attacked m the mountain defiles by the Wahabis and defeated At this juncture Saud endeavoured to conciliate the Persian Government and sent u n PUrp0Se Z 0 Shiraz - He also overtures for an alliance with the lintish Goyernment, which were reiected _ 10. Under Tousoun Pasha the Egyptian forces bad made no impression bavmg advanced only as far as Tayif, ' Garden of Mecca,' and 4,000 out of 8,000 regular troops had perished. But Mahomed Ali attached muob importance to a successful 1S sue of the operations a-aiust the WaSs considering that his influence at the Porte would thereby be much strengthen ed; so on hearing of his son's failure, he determined to .prooeTTn pe^on to' Arabia. Proceeding by sea to Jeddah, he landed at that place outhe °8th A.D. 1813. of August 1813. and pushing on to Mecc?* he distrusted, and sent him a prisoner^Calro! 1 ^ ^ hGV ^ Glia]lb » whom , . } 1 ' To, J soun Pasb a again advanced and attacked Tarabah, but failed and his force retreated with some loss to Tayif.

In January 1815 Mahomed Ali inflicted a defeat on the Wahabi Ar) 1815 army which was 20,000 strong, and shortly after returned with his own troops to Jeddah. Tousoun Pasha continued the campaign, and operating from Medina, entered the town of El-Rass, the capital of the district of El-Kaseem; the army of the Amir Ahdullah-bin-Saud being then at Aneyzah, little further east. At this juncture Mahomed iAli, who had again advanced to Medina, received the news of the landing of Napolean from Elba, and immediately returned to Egypt. Tousoun, however, was reinforced in El-Kaseem, and having opened negotiations with the Wahabi Amir, the latter sent his uncle, Abdullah-bin-Abdul Aziz, to the Egyptian camp to conclude a peace which was effected, the terms being on the basis of the Amir's submission to the Sultan of Turkey, and engagement to give hostages, and even to present himself in person at Constantinople if required by the Sultan to do so. Abdullah further agreed to surrender Der'eyyah to whomsoever the Sultan should appoint to be Governor, and to make restitution of the valuables plundered from Medina by the Wahabis under Saud. The submission of the Amir on this occasion was the more unaccountable that the Egyptian army was at the time in a critical position, and by operating on its communications and intercepting supplies, the Wahabis might have destroyed it. The Amir so far fulfilled the terms of the treaty as to despatch deputies and hostages to Egypt, but he nevertheless proceeded to punish those of the Arab tribes who had joined the Turks, and to prepare for the defence of El-Der'eyyah. 14. The Viceroy, on learning the terms of the peace concluded by his son, refused to ratify them, demanding that Abdullah should personally appear before him in Egypt to answer for his conduct. He also dismissed the Wahabi Envoys and sent further reinforcements to Arabia. About the same time Tousoun Pasha, hearing of the occurrence of a revolution in Egypt, hastened to return there, leaving garrisons in Medina and other towns. 15. On receipt of the Viceroy's demands, the Wahabi Amir despatched a reply couched in submissive terms, urging that the spoil taken from JVledina by his father was not in his possession, and saying that Mahomraed Ali might send a representative to govern Nejd, or impose tribute which would be cheerfully paid ; but he begged to be excused from proceeding to Constantinople. The Amir also wrote at the same time to Tousoun Pasha asking him to intercede in his favor with the Viceroy. The latter refused and returned the presents which accompanied the Amir's letter, and announced his intention of sending his son Ibrahim Pasha with an army to destroy El-Der'eyyah and bring the Amir a prisoner to Constantinople, Abdullah thereupon despairing of a peaceful issue prepared to fight. 16. Arrangements having been completed for renewal of the campaign against the Wahabis, Ibrahim Pasha, A.D. 1816. was ge | ecte( j on acC ount of his ability to conduct the operations, set out from Egypt in September 1816 at the head of a considerable force and proceeded to the scene of action. The first encounter seems to have taken place at El-Ma'wiyah, where Abdullah-bin-Saud attacked the Egyptian army and suffered May, A.D. 1817. a s jg n£ Q defeat. On this o -casion Ibrahim Pasha put to death all prisoners taken. The Pasha then advanced with 4,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry, besides contingents of the friendly Arab tribes Benu- Khalid, El-Muteyr, El-Oteybah, El-Harb and El-Suhool asainst El-Rass, which was held by a Wahabi garrison. Before this town Ibrahim Pasha suffered a serious check, and after besieging it for three and half months, having lost • Note .—The Wahabi forces were collected and nmrshalled by clans and districts Those from each district, formed a corps under the personal leadership of the local Amir or Chief.

A strict discipline was maintained. [C967FD] B6 3,000 men, he was obliged to agree to an armistic and abandon the siege. The Egyptian General, however, masking El-Rass, continued to advance eastward on Aneyzah, and the Amir retired south to Bureydah. After six days* bom bardment the fort of 'An^yzah surrendered, and tbe entire district of El-fCaseem then submitted to the Egyptian Commander. Abdullah retired on Simkiah, a town in th^ district of El-Washam, where he halted two months for reinforce* ments. During this tim^ the Pasha suoceeded in detaching from the Wahabi cause many of the Arab Bedoos who at heart disliked the strictness and severity of that sect and government. Amongst those who, actuated by an ient enmity against the \Vahabi, had from the outset joined the Egyptian side, was the powerful Shaikh of the Muteyr, Fe\ sal-el-Dawish, who trusted in a promise made to him by Ibrahim to place him in Der'eyyah as Governor of Nejd, a promise which the Pasha had no intention of fulfilling. 17. Havin? received at Bureydah a reinforcement of 800 men and two guns, as well as supplies of provisions and ammunition, Ibrahim Pasha was able to continue his advance on IShakrah at the head of 4,500 Turkish, Albanian, ^ ond Moorish troops in addition to Arab e^em er, . . . contingents. About 10,000 camels ac companied the force, and the infantry soldiers were usually mounted two on a camel. The Amir Abdullah meantime retired on his capital wasting the country before the enemy, and sending the surplus cattle and flocks to El-Hasa. This was in the latter part of December 1817, In t-he following month the Turkish army appeared before Shakrah, which was regularly approached under the direction of a Eronch Engineer, M. Vaissidre^and capitulated on the 2nd of A D 1813 January 1818. The lives of the garrison were spared, but they were deprived of their arms, and had to engage not to serve again under the Wahabi Amir. Some time after when El-Der'eyyah had fallen, Ibrahim Pasha caused the fortifications of Shakrah to be demolished, and when seen by Captain Sadleir the place was in ruins. 18. Abdullah-bin-Saud had now retreated to El Der'eyyah, and before following him up to the capital, Ibrahim Pasha judged it advisable to turn aside from the direct loute to take the town of Dhorama. At that place he encountered a spirited resistance, several of his men being killed. In revenge for this the male inhabitants were put to the sword, the town pillaged and destroyed, and the women given up to the brutality of the Turkish soldiery. Only the Governor and his guard who had shut themselves in a citadel were sutlered to escape with their lives. 19. Detained by rains, it was March before Ibrahim Pasha advanced on El-Der'eyyah. which town he invested in April with a force of 5,5 0 horse and foot, and twelve pieces of artillery, including two mortars and two howitzers. Shortly after, reinforcements and convoys of supplies reached the Turkish camp from Medina and Basrah. The siege onerations were for some time conducted without any success to the Turkish arms, and in the latt er p irt of the month of M ay an explosion having occurred by which the Pasha lost all his sf)are am munition, iiis position became extremely critical. Indeed the indomitable cour ge and good example of Ibrahim personally alone saved the army from disaster. The troops suffered much from dysentery and ophthalmia, and the Wahabis thought to overwhelm the besiegers by a sortie in force. The attack was, howev r, repulsed, and the opportunity lost to the besieged; for soon after the engagement caravans with fresh supplies of ammunition and provisions readied the Egyptian camp, and later reinforcements of infantry and cavalrv joined. News w^s also n-ceived of the appropch of Khakel Pasha from Egypt with three thousand fresh troops. Early in September the Amir sent a flag of truce to request an audience of the Pasha. This was accorded, and the Wahabi Chief was kindly received, but was informed that the first and indis pensable condition of peace was the attendence of Abdullah in person at Cairo. The Amir asked twenty four hours for reflection, which delay was granted, and at the expiration of the time he returned to the Pasha's camp and intimated his willingness to fulfil the condition imposed, provided Ibrahim would guirantee that his life would be spared. Ibrahim Pasha replied that he had no authority himself to bind the Sultan and the Viceroy on that point, but that he thought7 'bot i were too gpnerous to put him to death. Abdullah then pleaded for his family and prayed that El-Der'eyyah and his adherents should he spared. These terms were' conceded and a peace concluded. The ill-starred Amir at once set out on his journey under a strong escort, and on reaching Cairo was courteously received hy Mahomed Ali Pasha, who forwarded him on to Constantinople with a strong appeal for his pardon. The Government of the Porte was, however, implnc'ible ; ' Ahdullah-hin-Su'ood was paraded ignominiousiy through the streets of the capital for three days, after which he, with his companions in captivity, were publicly beheaded. i.0. The Amir Abdullah whilst inheriting the courage, is reputed to have lacked the ability and generosity of his father Saud, and it is probable that under the lalter the Wahabis would have made a more successful resistance to the Turkish arms. 21. After the surrender of Abdullah, Ibrahim Pasha, by order of his father, commenced his return mareh, and the Viceroy insisted on the destruc tion of El-Der'eyyah which was accordingly burnt. Four of the Ami^s brothers, Pahad, Sa'ad, Hasan, and Khalid, were carried as prisoners to Cairo. 22. The operations of the Egyptian army extended to El-Hasa and El- Katif on the Persian Gulf, and it was intended to place the Government of El-Hasa in the hands of the Beni-Khalid who, as hereditary enemies of the Wahabis, had joined the invaders. 23. During the progress of Ibrahim's operations in Nejd the adherents of the Wahabis at Bas-el-Khaimah, and that part of the Oman Coast had engatred in fresh piracies, and in order to put a stop to their depredations, the Government of India resolved on sendin? another expedition to chastise them. The Sultan of Maskat w as invited to co-operate in the undertaking which he readily consented to do. 24. On the news of the capture of El Der'eyyah reaching India, the Government conceived the idea of secur- a.d . 1819. co - 0 peration of the Egyptian Tasha also, against the pirates of Has el-Khaimah, and Captain Sadleir, of Her Majesty's 47th Eoot, was deputed to proceed to the camp of Ibrahim pasha to convey to him the congratulation of the Government of India on his success and proposed combined action and mutual co-operation. It was in April 1819, Ions? after H rahim Pasha had returned to Medina, when Captain Sadlier started from Bombay on this remarkable mission. He had instructions to call at Maskat to confer with the Sultan on the subject of the negotiation with which he was entrusted, and it appears that Seyyid Sa'eed took a clearer and more practical view of the question than the Government. His Highness considered it very improbable that Ibrahim Pasha would have power to discuss K) important .a'question of policy, but assuming he had. His Highness strongly deprecated, the association of Turkish troops in the proposed expedi tion against the Jowasim pirates, urging, tor one thing, that the cruelties committed by those troops in Nejd would i ender it repulsive to himself and his people to act in allianee with them against Arabs; further His Highness held with reason that the plan of inviting the Turks to 'Oman would be fraught with danger to the independence of the Maskat State. 25. From Maskat, Captain Sadiier continued his adventurous journey, and reaching El-Hasa found that the Egyptian General had returned to Medina, and that the whole of the Turkish forces were being withdrawn from the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf sea-board. He joined a Turkish detachment under orders to march westward from El-Hasa, and travelled in their company. Passing El-Der'eyyeh, he found that town in ruins, and saw not a single inhabi ant. Shakrah also had been razed to the ground. 26. The Envoy eventually reached the camp of Ibrahim Pasha near Medina, and. on unfolding the purpose of his journey, it turned out that, as suggested by the Sultan of Maskat, the General had no authority to enter on the negotiation, and could only refer to proposals to his father, the Viceroy of Egypt. The latter ultimately intimated that neither he nor the Porte desired or needt d foreign aid in dealing with the Wahabis of Nejd.8 27. In the year 1822 it was reported from Nejd that Mahommed Ali D Pasha had posted a detachment of cavalry in Aneyza, and iiad ordered the walls of El-der'eyyah to be rebuilt. During the same year news came of the ■ d ^ massacre of a Turkish garrison at Kiadh BeBurrectionofWahabis, 1824-30. by the Arabs 28. In the winter of 1823-24 Turki-bin-Adullah-bin Mahommed-bin 1823-24. Su'ood, commonly known as Turki- Turki-bin-Abdullah. bin-Saud, headed a successful risin2: of the Arabs and possessed himself of El-Riadh, where there was an Egyptian detachment under Abdullah-bin-Nasir El'Ayathee. Having sent off these men to Medina, Turki consolidated his power in Nejd, and was recognized as Amir by most of the Central Arabian tribes. 29. For some years Turki-bin-Abdullah was engaged in hostilities a.d. 1829 against the Beni-Khalid of El-Hasa, the persistent opponents of the Wahabis, and eventually in 1829 inflicted on them a decisive defeat, when El-Hasa was occupied by the Wahabis and the Beni-Khalid Shaikhs were expelled. During all these proceedings Turki had continued to pay a tribute to a .d. 1830. Mahoramed Ali Pasha, who accorded countenance to his action. 30. In the year 1831 the Sultan of Maskat made overtures to the a.d. 18 3i Wahabi Amir with a view to receiv- . ing the Government of the islands of Bahrein as the tributary of the Amir. The latter however preferred to receive the tribute for Bahrein from the Uttubi Sheikhs. At this period the whole line of coast as far as Ras-el-Hadd was dominated by the Wahabi, and rendered tribute. Turki-bin-Abdullah made friendly overtures to the Government of Bombay, which were politely acknowledged and led to no further result. 31. In the year 1834 the Chief of Bahrein threw off allegiance to the a.d. 1834. Wahabi, and even ventured to blockade El-Katif and Ojair. 32. In 1834 the career of Turki-bin-Abdullah was cut short bv his murder by a relative named Mashari, who was in turn put to death by Eeysal Amir Turki, and Eeysal became the recognized Chief of the V? &lt;i.u£lDlS» 33.

Mahomed Ali Pasha resolved on installing Khalid-bin-Saud as tributary ruler of Nejd. and sent him with a force under command of Isma'i Bey who had orders to assist him to his authority. As Khalid had numerous adherents amount the Arab, L g „ i had to retire to El-Hasa, and Kbalid with his Egvptian a'uxili-irm* * , ysal session of El-Dcr'eyyah and El-Riadh. Sor^TZitrerensuld but n ^v, 8 ' arrival of Khorsheed Pasha with further reinforcements, Feysal w^s so hard! pressed that he surrendered himself and was sent a prisoner to Cairo. 6. Khorsheed Pasha then cast aside Khalid who had been merelv a tool in the hands of the Egyptian Commanders, and having established the9 authority of the Egyptian Government over all Nejd, prepared to enforce the submission of the Bahrein Islands also. At this point the British Government interfered, and the remonstrances which were addressed to Mahommed Ali Pasha induced him to relinquish his designs on Bahrein. The British Govern- A ^ 1839 ment had now adopted a decisive attitude, and resolved to oppose the further pro gress of the Egyptian power as regarded Bahrein and Oman. It was even iotimated that any attempts in that direction would be met by force. 3o. Soon after the Egyptian forces commenced to evacuate Nejd, and Khalid was left as Vali or Governor on the part of the Turkish Government. A p l8il In 18ii he was suspected of designs against Oman, and a distinct warning was conveyed to him from the Government of India to desist. S7. In 1812 Abdullah-bin-Thaneyyan-Ibrahim bin-Thaneyyan-bin-Saud a. d 1842 headed a rising against Khalid, who, with the few remaining Egyptian troops, was ejected from Riadh. 38. In 1843 Eeysal-bin-Turki having escaped from confinement appeared . in Neid and succeeded in recovering his .A. TJ 184S position as Amir. One of the first steps he took was to prepare to send a force under S I'eed-bin-Mutiak to reduce Oman to obedience When the Chiefs of Ormm appealed to the British to save them from subjection to the Wahabi Chief, they were informed that the previous policy of opposition to the progress of the Wahabis in their direc tion had reference to extension of the Egyptian power, and, as that was no longer apprehended, ho interference was contemplated on their behalf. Eeysal having at the same time made friendly overtures to the British Government, they were responded to in the same spirit. Nevertheless, when Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak the General and A gent of the Amir Eeysal, threatened Maskat in the year 1845, he was met by a British naval demonstration on the Batina Coast. On this oc casion the Regent of Maskat engaged to pay a yearly tribute of 5,030 dollars, and on that condition peace was concluded. The fort of Bereymee continued in the occupation of the Wahabi Agent, a position from which he could dominate the pirate coast and command the passes to Eastern 'Oman. On one occasion in 1848 the Chief of the Beni-Yas succeeded in ejecting the Wahabi garrison from Bereymee, but they soon recovered it. 39. The province of El-Hasa was forced to submit to Feysal's authority, having been reduced by Abdullah, the Amir's eldest son, reputed a brave and skillful commander. In the west Jebel Shammer had through the energy and ability of its Chief Abdullah-bin-Rashid been permanently detached from the Wahabi possessions. Eeysal himself had his residence at Riadh, which town had been selected as capital by Turki bin-Abdullah. The Amir at this period of his life was infirm and obese, and suffered also from ophthalmia, which eventually deprived him of sight. 40. When the Chief of Bahrein, Mahomed bin-Khalifah, received the aid of the Wahabi Amir, he had agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 4,000 dollars. In the year 1851 a quarrel arose A.D.1851. between the Amir and the Bahrein Chief, in consequence of which the former appeared in person in El-Katr, and hav ing detached the tribes of that district from the Uttubi cause, threatened to occupy Bahrein Islands. This was prevented by the appearance on the scene of British vessels of war, and an arrangement was come to by which the town of El-Bidaa was restored to the Bahrein Chief. 41. In order to arrest the threatened invasions of the Arab tribes on the course the Resident in 1855 found it Pey sal's nominal dependence on necessary to point out to Eeyaal that the Turkey. 1855. British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, But Eeysal replied :— ' With regard to what you observe that engagements have existed between the Chiefs of the coast o£ Oman and the Resident for a penud of 3U years, this is well known to me ; [C967ED]10 their object be'ng to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the harbouring of disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of which I quite approve on the part of Residents, both those who have g &gt;ne before, and those who comeafter, for there is an under standing between us and the British Government of UK) years duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas.

Further the people of the districts in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes or more powerful than, and have the command over the inhabitants of the coast and could n^t he restrained from preying upon and slaughtering them, but that 1 maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds th o m lack from the people of the coast. These last are well assured of his protection; otherwise, wera they abandoned to their fate, they could not subsist. Moreover, when owing to their negligence, disasrreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed have arisen between some of the Chiefs of the coasts aforesaid, there was none who could check them and restore order and good will among them, except the Lieutenant in charge of Oman, whose office is among the things pleasing to God and his Prophet, as also to the Sultan of the faithful—may &lt;3od strengthen the faith by his means. Being a depen dant of the exalted Turkish Government, I hold the confirmation cf the Sultan to my continuance in authority over all the Arabs. To exemplify this, when Mahomed Ali Pasha, having projected his schemes against Basrah and Mohammerah and thfi territory pertaining thereto entftrtaining designs upon Indli, deputed his envoy to me, proposing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his own sons, to induce me to forward his views with respect to the ecastoF Omanand elsewhere within the Peninsula of Arabia, and to offer no hindrance or opposition—for of others, besides the Arabs, he took no account owing to his exalted dignity— I replied,' you know that I am a dependant of the Sultan of the 'Faithful from whom if you possess orders to that effect let me be informed of them ; otherwise the thing is impossible.' Thereon war broke out between me and him, which lasted two years, and intelligence thereof duly reached the Sublime Porte, and they (the Suhan^s Govern nent) greatly rejoiced and were much pleased with me and my influence and consideration with them increased exceedingly. May God perpetuate their rule and the glory of their State ' 42. In writing in this strain Eeysal's object apparently was twofold ; first to put forward a general claim to lordship over the whole of Arabia; and second, to try whether the affectation of being only the Viceregent of a Euro pean Power might serve to divert the Bdtish Government from interference between himself and the maritime Arabs whom he asserted to be his feudatories. 43. A letter of this period from the Resident is of some interest as showing the designs upon Arabia then entertained by either the Ottoman Porte or, as is more probable, Abbas Pasha, the half-crazy debauchee who succeeded Mahomed Ali in Egypt. Colonel Hennell speaks of the probable acquisition of Bahrein by the Wahabis as being tantamount to its acquisition by the Porte, and justifies this assertion by the following considerations :—the Amir pays a regular tribute to the Turkish Government; there are accredited envoys from Abbas Pasha in the Amir's camp; the Wahabi Agent at Koweit (a Turkish port) passes himself off as an envoy from the Pasha of Egypt; there are Turkish emissaries along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf ; and Turkish Steamers are in course of equipment for service in the Gulf. 44. Mahomed-bin-Abdullah had, in 1843, been expelled from Bahrein, the government of which he had seized the previous year, and for several Troubles in Katif, a.d 1869. ^ ^ 'fhief had resided at Damaum under Wanabi protection ; until m the year 1859 Eeysal determined to support him in recovering the government of the islands, and made preparations to give him active assistance. A demonstr ation was thereupon made by the British squadron which had the effect of frustrating the scheme to the intense annoyance of the Wahabi Amir. On the British Resident demanding the expulsion of Mahoramed-biD-Abdullah from Damaum, Feysal replied in terms of bitter reproach, inveighing, against the policy of the British Government in denying his right of suzerainty over Bahrein and the Uttubis. The Amir was able to complain with truth that the actual Chief of Bahrein, Mahomed-bin-Khalifah, had provoked his resentment, and rendered himself justly liable to reprisals by inciting the tribes of El-Katar to acts of aggression against Wahabi subjects. In 1861 the A jj 1861&gt; Bahrein Chief went so far as to cruise with six armed boats againt Damaum, a proceeding which was disapproved and censured by the British Government. Pressure was brought on Mahomined-bin-Khalifah to force him to withdraw11 his vessels to his own waters, and he was bound by treaty, in 1861, to refrain from such acts of aggression in future. By the action of the British squadron towards Damaum the same year, the refugee Sheikh Mahommed- bin-Abdullah was forced to quit that place. 45. These strong measures elicited a remonstrance from the Turkish Gov- Turkish Protest against British pro- ernor (general of Baghdad. He wanted to ceedings, I8e2. know by what right we had bombarded Damau, a place which, as lying within the territory of ' Feysal Beg, the Kaunmakam of Nejd,' was ' part of the hereditary dominions of the Sultan.' To which Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad replied that we had hitherto ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Eeysal as well as witii all the Chiefs and Principalities situated on the shores of the, Per&gt;ian Gulf'; that our pacific policy in the Gulf was well known, and that in the prosecution of that policy we ' had never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of anv other State—an authority and jurisdiction moreover which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter ' In report- ino- this correspondence to Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople the Consul-General wrote as follows :— ' Althouch it may not be denied that, since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40, Amir Fey sal has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his tribute being r^arded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Poite has never exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority over that country. Were it otherwi-e, w^re a Turkish administration established capable of cor.trolling the i rovince, restraining the Wahabis and their dependants from the piratical practic3s for which they were once so notorious, and fimlly of preventing or g ving satisfaction for any breach of international law, such a etate of things might be as conducive to good order, as it would be certainly less burdensome-to the British Government than the maritime surveillance, which, in the interests of commerce, the British Government is now compelled to maintain in the Persian Gulf. But in point of fact, the Porte has not the power In punish or coerce its tribu tary ; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country ; and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi Coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty's Indian ^ Government in that quarter.' 46. In August of 1865 a combined force of Wahabis and Jenebah tribe British war against Amir Fey sal, attacked and plundered the Oman port of a. d. 1865. Soor, during which affair certain British subject were sufferers. A remonstrance was accordingly addressed to the Wahabi Amir, which failina to elicit satisfaction, a demonstration was made by H. M. S. Highflyer off Katif and Demau. At the latter place the opera tions were unsuccessful and unfavourable, but the forts of Soor were destroyed and the Jenebah tribe punished. Before further measures could be taken, the old Amir Peysal-bin-Turki died. Por some years before his death he had been incapacitated for work by blindness and feebleness, and the power had been virtually exercised by his son 'Abdullah, who now succeeded as Amir. 47. Abdullah-bin-Peysal lost no time in sending an agent named Mahom- ed-bin-Abdullah-bin-Manah on a mis- jD Xo6o • sion to Bushire charged with friendly over tures to the British representative, and to convey the assurances of the new Amir to the British Government that he would pay due regard to British in terests in future. The Amir engaged to abstain from attacking Arab States in friendly alliance with the British Government, and to content himself with receipt of the customary tribute from the Maskat State. These assurances having been accepted by the British Government, no further action in reference to past offences was taken. 48.-A. One of the grounds, on whicb the Porte based its claim to sovereignty , , ^ over the Arabian Peninsula was ex- Obsolete title of award of Arabia by , . , . , i „ +1 ^ an Abbaside Caliph to the Porte. plained m a memorandum drawn by the Moore's Precis. Bev. Mr. Badger, of the conversation secret E., August 1883, Nos. 221-225. which that gentleman had in Paris with M. de Kemusat, the French Minister for Eoreign Affairs and Server Pasha, then12 Ottoman Ambassador to France, and forwarded to the Foreign Office in 1&amp;72 by bir B. Frere, then on his way to Zanzibar as special envoy. In this memorandum,'after observing that from what had passed he inferred that the Porte had ' signified to France its claim to the entire seaboard of Arabia, extending from Suez to the head of the Persian Gulf, and therefore including Oman or the principality of Maskat.' Dr. Badger continued : — ' The claim of Turkev to the Provinces of Yemen and Nejd, and to the intervening maritime provinces, including Oman, is foundpd on the fiction that a lineal descendent of the Ambasside Khalifahs of Baghdad invested Salim II, afrer his conquest of E^-ypt and his suc cesses on the shores of the Red Sea, with the sovereignty over the whole of Arabia. It is indisputable, however, that during the existence of the dynasty nearly the whole of Arabia had revolted from its authorities and set up native principalities and ehiefdoms, which have maintained their independence until the recent attempts made by the Turks to subjugate them in Yemen and Nejd. All that they can fairly lay claim to is the seaboard of Arabia from Suez to Mokha which they have held with occasional intermission since their first conquests in the Red Sea in the 16th century. As regards Oman, the native annals of the province incontestably prove that it became independent of the Baghdad Khalifate in the loth century and has never since been subject to foreign rule except for a short time to the Persians. The same is tueof the Arab chiefd 'ms in the Peisian Gulf; whose history is intimately connected with that of Oman ; moreover, it is indisputable that neither the Turks nor the Egyptians have ever exercised any jurisdiction over the territories referred to, and that the Turks themselves, in 1847, virtually admitted the independence of the Imams and other Arab chief- d^ms in the Persian Gulf, is proved in the follo wing extract from a Vizerial letter addressed to the Pasha of Baghdad on the subject of the slave trade as given in Aitchison's Treaties, Volume VII, page 192 :— ' Votre Excellence sait qu'il a dan ces environs la des Gouvernements, et des Imams independant# et, cela etant, des chatiments dont il s'agit^ ne peuvent pas etre appliques a leurs batimeuts/' But preposterous as their claims may be, there is every probability that the Turks will lose no time in endeavouring to enforce them. The result of partial success would be to introduce a fresh element of complication and strife into the Eastern Sea without any corresponding advantage either to the Turks themselves or to the threatened maritime Native States and chiefdoms, or to the British Government.' 48'B. It would seem that the Sublime Porte had at this time in view the Holy Ottoman Empire. idea of rev i viD g ^ the whole of the Arabian P en i ns ^a its religio political empire, what may be called the Holy Ottoman Empire, in analogy of the Holy Roman • see Bryce 's Holy Roman Empire.

International arrangements took place among many of these states of the Holy Roman Empire or between many of them and states outside the Empire, without the cognizance of, or in opposition to, the Imperial Power or the Roman Pontiff, a process which mi^ht as well and is in fact repeated in our days in the Holy Ottoman Empire.13 CEAPTER THIRD. * Turkish Expedition into Kejd and Hasa, 1871-72. 49.

In early manhood, when heir apparent and practically regent for his blind father, he shewed some energy and ability as a leader of raids, but what popularity _ he then enjoyed was far exceeded by that of his brother Saud, the beau-ideal of an Arab prince—'handsome, reckless, frank and open -handed. On their father Eeysal's death in 1865, the inevitable contest bearan between the brothers for the Amirship. It lasted until 1870, when Abdullah, tin ally defeated, sought the aid of the hated, and, as the Wahabis of Nejd bold, in fidel Turks. Ttie result was that a 'iurkish expedition under Midhut Pasha, Valiof Eaghdarl, proceed ing from Basrah by sea, occupied, with Abdullah s aid, the Hasa Distiict of the Nejdean Principality. First report of intended Expedition. 49-4 l . Some rumour of an intended expedition reached the Indian Govern ment in the beginning of 1871, and secret i., isa, Nos. 58i.05o (No osi). Colonel Herbert was asked by telegraph on the 17th February whether it was true that the Ottoman Government were preparing a force at Baghdad with the view of occupying positions on the Arabian Coast. He replied that there was apparently no foundation for the rumour, and that no troops were available for such a purpose; he would report immediately if any such design was ascertained. Coionel Herbert at the same time telegraphed to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, enquiring whether, as rumoured in Baghdad, the Porte contemplated sending four ships of war to the Persian Gulf, and whether there was any intention of occupying positions therein. He received a reply that the Porte denied all intention of occupying positions in the Gulf, but two of the vessels composing the Yemen expedition were to be stationed between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Design of Expedition revived. 50. On the 27th March Colonel Herbert intimated by telegraph that* under orders from Constantinople, an ibid. (No. 582). expedition wis about to be sent by land and sea from Baghdad towards Nejd with the view of supporting Abdullah. He was asked in reply how the Turkish expedition by sea was to so, and at what part of the Arab Coast it was proposed that it should land. His answer was that it would go in one corvette and three unarmed steamers and in such other vessels as could be obtained, and that it would disembark at Katif or Damaura. Position of parties in Nejd. 51. In consequence of this news, the Kesident in the Persian Gulf was instructed on the 2Sth March to telegraph H,d. (No. 585.) the latest particulars about Wahabi affairs and to describe the situation of the contending parties. It was ascer tained from him that the Wahabi Amir, S;iud (brother of Abdullah), stil held the district of Hasa, with the sea coast, and that he was about to move for another battle with his brother. Abdullah was a fugitive. A letter from Colonel Pelly, dated 11th March, contained substantially the same intelligence. • The contents of this chapter are mainy indebted to Major Hendersoa'a Frecis of the Nejd Expedition. [C967rD] »14 Expedition temporarily postponed; Enquiries made from Porte re garding it. 52.

The expedition had, he said, been temporarily postponed. All the information regarding the expedition was telegraphed home to the Secretary of State on the 31st March, and he was told:— *'Warlike operations in any part of Gnlf to be deprecated as breach of maritime peace, Th j (\ Kssn destructive to our trade, and likely to give rise to L ' complications.

The Bombay Government, on the 11th April, telegraphed that Colonel ihid (No 59i) Pelly had reported that the belief in the expedition was general in Bushire :— 'I am,' said Colonel Pelly, &lt;f indirectly asked whether Arabs would be forbidden aiding Wahabis ag-ainst Turks. I re pecthilly request instructions, and, unless specially ordered, should not interfere, as maritime truce does m t relate to Turks. If Government wish me to watch proceedings, an efficient steamer would be necessary. There is at present no Govern ment vessel in Persian Gulf. I suggest that Government of India request Political Agent, Baghdad, to keep me informed of expedition movement.' 54. The Bombay Government was told :— In event of expedition sailing, Pelly should not interfere with proceedings of Turkish Ibid (No 59') authorities w T itbout specific orders from Govern ment of India, to whom he should immediately report. If Arabs take part in quarrel, he should limit his action strictly to maintaining maritime truce. No vessel need be sent specially to Persian Gulf. 'Porte' understood to have sailed yesterday.' 55. Colonel Pelly enquired on the 22nd April:— 'Am I correct in understanding that Government of India desire me to use all influence Jfiuf. (No. 599.) towards preventing trucial Chiefs aiding Wahabis • , m • i /-■ . a p a i ns t Turks, or in any way moving by sea? vV hat reply am I to give to Trucial Chiefs if, continuing to observe maritime peace, they ask whether we will protect them attempting ( ?) from sea by Turks ?

Colonel Herbert telegraphed, on the 17th April, that preparations for Ibid. (No. 595.) the expedition were being resumed and that it would leave Baghdad in a few days. Three steam vessels had been ordered to convey six regiments and 12 guns. One thousand Anb horses to go by land. The first portion of the force left Baghdad on the 23rd April, and another detachment two days after. Complications in Gulf. 57. The Bombay Government, on the ,8rd May, forwarded the following im. (No, 611.) from Colouel Pell y *' Imam Sand and Bahrein Chief write that Turkish Arab Chief of Koweit is preparing to aid expedition. Imam requests Koweit may be restrained, or Imam be permitted to act by pea. Bahrein Chief relies on trucial engagement and advice and protection. My respectful opinion is, that Turkish expedition is on every account inexpedient, and should, if possible, be averted. If persisted in, Indian Government are not committed to interfere under trucial engagement as between Wahahis, Koweits, and Turks. 1 think we could not assent to a naval attack by Turks or Koweit on trucial Chiefs loyal to their engagements with us. I + PaTaorant 55 respectfully solicit early instructions on this tele gram and that of 22nd April.'t15 The Bombay Government observed ' It is probable Turldsh Governor may count on our known policy preventing all naval operations by littoral powers in Gulf, but Turkey no party to truce. To prevent Wahabi from acting-by sea against Turk or Koweit it' allied with Turkey is practically an active interference in favour of Turkey. Neither Wahabi nor Koweit parties to truce/' 58. On the 9th May the following enquiry from Colonel Pelly wns received ibid. (No. 626.) through the Bombay Government:— ' Can Turks and Koweit make trucial Chiefs harbour a basis of operations against Wahabis in friendly relation with Chief? * * * I presume British subjects employed on Turkish vessels could not be concerned in molestation of trucial Chief.' Colonel Felly's object in asking this last question is explained in his letter No. 505—130, dated 20th May. He was under the imp ression that the debarka tion could only be effected by force and by aid of the fleet's artillery. A debarkation of this character would, in his opinion, coustitute a maritime operation, and would— ' afford ground for misrepresentation- and even misunderstanding of onr known policy of preventing all naval operations by the littoral powers of the Persian Gulf.' British policy in the Persian Gnlf: That policy how affected by Nejd Expedition. 59. A general Tiew of the British policy of the Gulf, how that policy was likely to be affected by the Turkish Hid K.-W., pages 7-8. i i. au - a - expedition, was discussed at tins time in the Foreign Department. The following is extracted from the Poreign Secre tary Mr. Aitchison's note, dated 3rd May 1871:— ' It should never be forgotten that, in all its main features, our position in the Persian Gulf is one which we have taken up on grounds of policy. Its foundation in Treaty is of the most meagre and narrow kind. In reality it is a position which we have arbitrarily assumed as an act of State or conquest, the justification of it lying,7?^, in the circumstances of the time at which w^e entered on it; and, secondly&gt; the length of time during which we have asserted the position we have assumed. His Excellency in Council may, perhaps, rot be aware how exceedingly narrow is the scope of the Treaty engagements with the Ar.ib tribes fcr the maintenance of the peace at sea. The Chief of Bahrein is bound by his special agreement to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description so long as he is protected by the British Government from similar aggressions by the Chiefs and tribes of the Gulf. But the Chiefs who have subscribed the ] erpetual feace have bound themselves only to absiain from aggressions on the subjects of the subscribing parties, and our rijiht or duty to interfere in virtue of the Treaty is limited to cases in which one of the parties to the maritime peace commits an outrage on another. In all other cases our interference with warlike operations, whether by parties to the Treaty of peace, or by Chiefs who are not parties to that Treaty, is based on no tetter foundation than our own determina tion to do so, ai)d the fact that we have done so for a long series of years. If we have no Treaty right, and are under no Treaty obligation to prevent such an expedition as the present on the part of Turkey or Persia, neither have we any such right, or are we under any such obligation, to prevent any of the subscribers to the maritime peace from attacking the Turks or the Persians by sea, or fitting out a similar expedition against any party who has not signed the Treaty. It may be said that the Turkish expedition is so far peculiar, that it is proceeding against Turkish subjects to re-establish authority in their own countiy. The recent telegrams make this by no means certain, but even if it be the case, it hardly affects the question. We cannot make our policy at sea depend on Arab politics ash re; we cannot attempt to make our interference to prevent an expedition by sea depend on the justice or injustice of the claims which the expedition is intended to assert. To do so would involve us in the intricate domestic relations of the Arab tribes, which we neither know nor are capable of understanding. Hitherto our policy has been to prevent all expeditious by sea and to impose the restriction on all alike, both great and small. The possibility of our maintaining our position seems to me to depend on onr maintaining it in its integrity If we admit exceptions, I do not see where we can stop in oui retreat till we reach the narrow ground covered by our Treaties. We shall never make the exceptions intelligible to those who are not admitted to the benefit of them- If the Turks send their troops by sta, the Wahabis and the Arab Chiefs who support Saud have clearly a right to attack them by sea. If the Arabs are defeated, we cannot prevent the Turks from exercis ing over them ali the rights of successful war, and establishing their supremacy over the Arab country. There is then an end to our policy in the Gulf ; or if the Arab Chiefs, remaining quiet now, wish hereafter to lit out some naval force, how are we to prevent them when we16 have permitted tbe Turks to do so, or how are we to make the prohibition intellig-ible^ ? Or if Persia, desirous to have a fleet in the Gulf to establish her claims to supremacy, should throw herself on some foreign power and. procure vessels of war, on what grounds are we to remons trate ? She could only do so on grounds equally applicable to the prevention of this expedition, and by declining to interfere with this expedition, we almost debar ourselves from urging those grounds against Persia, or at all events greatly weaken the force of the argument and the value of the remonstrance. This expedition is like the little rent in the ernhankment, insigni ficant in itself and easily repaired at first, but if not repaird, certain to end in the destruction of the whole work.' 60. Various despatches, ending with No. 28 of tke 20th May 1870, had been addressed to the Secretary of State regarding the policy of the British Government in the Gulf. Thus the precise relations in which the British Gov ernment stood in regard to such powers as Turkey and Persia, as well as to the less powers, not having been precisely determined, it was difficult for the Gov ernment of India to adopt a tangible and intelligible policy. 61. Colonel Felly's telegram regarrling Koweit {vide paragraph 57) illus trated the difficulties of the position. Koweit is a port on the extreme north west of the Persian Gulf ; and Mr. Aitchison observed :— ' The inhabitants acknowleged the sovereignty of the Porte, and 'se the Turkish flag, though their allegiance to the Sultan is merely rominal. The ru ing family are a branch of the Uttoobee tribe with the patronymic ' A1 Subah/ The Bahrein family, it will be remem bered, are also a branch of the Uttoobees, Colonel Pelly was quite right in stating* that the ♦ Vide paragraph 57. Indian Government are not committed to inter fere under trucial engagements as between 'Wahabis, Koweits, and Turks.' But neither are we, except in regard to Bahrein, committed to interfere under trucial engagements as beiween Turks, Koweits, and the trucial Chiefs. We are coiflmitted under the Treaty only to interference as between the trucial Chiefs them selves. The Treaty with Bahrein has wider scope. The Chief of Bahrein agrees to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description, so looon as he receives the support of the British Government against bimilar aggressions from the Chiefs and tribes of the Gulf; he agrees to make known to the Resident, as arbitrator, all aggressions and depredations which may be designed by sea against him ; ' and the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted, or in course of infliction, by sea upon Bahrein, or upon its dependencies in this Gulf/ We are' therefore, bound to interfere on behalf of Bahrein should any attack by sea be made or design ed ; in regard to the other Chiefs, except incase of at'ack by one subscribing Chief upon another, our interference is matter of policy and not of ouli[;ation.' Explicit assurances of the Porte- 62. On the 25th April, Colonel Herbert reported a rumour that, if the ibid (No. 601.) expedition to Nejd was successful, it would eventuallv be directed to the ac quisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the Arab Coast. He requested instructions Being asked his authority for the statement, he replied that the report now generally believed at Baghdad, and accorded with Turkish pretensions as reported in his letter of 16th March 1870. That letter gave cover to a protest by Midhut Pasha on behalf of his Government against the proceedino-s which Colonel Pelly had, with the sanction of the British Government, taken a short time before at Bahrein. The Pasha stated that— ' Bahrein and its dependencies are countries of the Ottoman dominions ard the Gov ernment of those localities appertains to the Kaim-Makamiek of Nejd, subject to the Ottoman Government' The protest was sent to the Secretary of State under cover of a Secret d^- patch No. 28 of 20th May 1870, from the Government of India, with the remarks :— ^We have already informed Yoar Grace that any disposition to admit the pretension, of Persia to supremacy over Bahrein would probably lead to the revival of similar obsolete claims on the part of iurkey This result, which we foresaw, has now actuallv been brou-ht about A nd as Your Grace will perceive from Col ;nel Herbert's letter of 6th March, which forms mU of the enclosures of this despatch. His Excellency Midhut Pasha, the Governor -General nf Baghdad, has formally claimed Bahrein and its dependencies as countries of the Ottoman domi nions. This claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was surnmarilv re-' jected by Lord Palmerston in 1851, and, iu our opinion, should net be re-opened/' '17 63. On 28th April, Colonel Herbert again telegraphed as follows ' Ambassador telegraphs repeatedljr at my rpqnest the following :—I have positive assur- Jlid No. 608. ances from the Ottoman Porte that they intend establishing supermacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes of Southern Arabia and that no special attack is contemplated against them ' 64. Colonel Herbert's telegram of the 25tli, regarding the rumoured ibid No cos intentions of the expedition, was reported on 28th, to the Secretary of State, who was asked whether an assurance could not be obtained from the Turkish Gov ernment that the expedition had no other object than the settlement of the affairs of Nejd. The Secretary of State replied :— ' Her Majesty's Government have received assurance from Constantinople that Turkish Government have no such designs as those mentioned.' To clear up the discrepancy between the imformation received from Her Majesty's Government, and that received from the Political Agent at Baghdad, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was immediately communicated with by telegraph both direct and through Colonel Herbert. 65. The result of this reference was that Sir H. Elliot telegraphed on the zmicme. 12th May:- ' TAe Ottoman Forte explicitly denies all intention of extending supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribet of Southern Arabia, and contemplates no attack against them. The sole object of the expedition is declared to he the restoration in Nejd of the tranquillity which is disturbed by the hostility of the brothers Sheikh Abdoollah and Sheikh Snood. I received assurances that no waritime operations are intended in the Gulf, the vessel employed being only intended as transport to convey troops to a point from which theu can reach Uejd..' 66. A detailed account of the interview on the 25th April at which the Grand Vizier communicated these assurances regarding the intentions of the Secret H., 1871) Nos. 114-120. f ^^ Office despatch No 29, dated 12th May 1871. It appears that the following memorandum by Sir H. Elliot was communicated through Mr. Pisani to the Grand Vizier :— 'J The accounts from Bagdad are to the effect that, for a considerable time past, Midhut Pasha had l)een endeavouring to attract the attention of the Porte, to the movement going on in Nejd and the adjacent provinces. His Excellency wishes to obtain for the Ottoman Gov ernment a more real supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes of South Arabia; has induced him to persuade the Porte to undertake a costly and impossible enterprise indeed, under the ostensible pretext of supporting Abdoollah, whom he has represented as Abdoollah, after succeeding his father as absolute Kaimakan or functionary of the Ottoman Govern- Ruler of Nejd, may have been recognized by. the ment, of which be has hitherto maintained his f orte as its Governor, but it is a delusion to speak of perfect independence. The anxiety of Midhut Kaimakan. Pasha to obtain the command of Bahrein and Katif, and to establish the supremacy of the Porte over the whole of Central and Southern Arabia, has the appearance of not,being untinctured with a growing jealousy of British influence in the Persian Gulf. It is too late to hope that what I cannot but look upon as an ill-advised expedition will be stopped ; but as any disturbance of the existing relations of the different Governments on the borders of the Persian Gulf will certainly not be seen with indifference by Her Majesty's Government, Mr. Pisani will tell the Grand Vizier that I should be glad to give Lord Granville such explanations as shall re-assure them with regard to the object of it. When the report of an intended expedition in the Persian Gulf and Central Arabia reached me some months ago, I was authorized to assure Her Majesty's Government that it had no founda tion. It now appears that, although, at that time the Porte had no intention of sending one, the Governor-General of Bagdad had resolved upon it, and the motive was assigned to it, of the necessity of supporting the authority of a purely nominal Kaimakan, who had never before re cognized that of the Porte, must necessarily be received with caution'. 67. Mr. Pisani replied:— 'I have communicated word for word to Ali Pasha Your Excellency's instruction of this day's date relative to Nejd, &amp;c. After I concluded, His Highness seemed excited and annoyed, and told me that all independent States are perfectly at liberty to deal with their internal affairs as circumstances may require. Nejd, he went on to say, being an integral part of the Sultan's dominions, the Porte cannot be debarred from the exercise of its authority over it. He con tended that Abdoollah is not an absolute ruler, as supposed, but a functionary holding his ap- [C967FD] E18 poinfcmeut of Kaimakan in virtue o£ an imperial firman, and therefore entitled to be supported by the Government against those who attack him. Your Excellency^ said Jli Patkt,, may give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty's Government that the Porte entertains no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes of South- Arabia, and does not contemplate any attack upon them or harbour any design to subdue them. Be asserts that the true and sole object of the present enterprise is^to pacify the two brothers, to prevent the protraction of disorder, and to restore tranquillity ' 11, Midhut Paska confirms assurances of Porte- 68. On receipt of the above assurances from the Porte, Colonel Herbert was directed on the 17th May to take an secret i., 1871, Nos. 581-685 (No. 644). early opportunity, without seeking a formal interview with Midhut Pasha, of expressing casually to him the satisfaction of the British Government at the communication from the Porte. This he did and informed Government that the Pasha explicitly confirmed the assurances of the Porte. 12. Instructions to Colonel Pelly. 69. The receipt of the above assurances from the Porte enabled Govern ment to give the much required instruc tions to Colonel Pelly. He was directed, in a letter dated 17th May to the Bombay Government, to communicate the substance of Sir H. Elliot's message to the Chief of Bahrein and those of the trucial Chiefs who had made enquiries regarding the object of the Turkish expedition. With regard to the general questions put by Colonel Pelly it was said: . u he should be informed that it is impossible for His Excellency in Council to give instructions regarding contingencies of the occurrence of which there is no immediate prospect. The Turkish expedition, however, in no way affects *the Treaty rights and obligations either of the British Government or of the Chiefs who have subscribed the maritime peace. Colonel Pelly may' so inform the Chiefs who have consulted him, and should use all legitimate means to maintain the stipulations of the Treaties.' im No. 645. Eeport to Secretary of State with views of Government. 70. On the 23rd May Government forwarded to the Secretary of State all the papers received up to date regarding events in Nejd and the expedition, and after a resume of the correspondence that had taken place, observed : ' Although the assurances so explicitly given by the Turkish Government may for the present allay any immediate apprehensions, we think it not improbable that the expedition to Nejd may, from the force of circumstances, assume more serious proportions than the Porte at present contemplate. ' We beg to draw the attention of Your Grace to the latest letters on the subject received from the Political Agent at Bagdad. These papers show tfae difficulties which the Turks are likely to encounter, and (the complications that may arise from ;the prosecution of their enterprise. It is, therefore,.highly desirable, both in the interest ;of the Porte and the peace of the Persian Gulf, that the expedition should be stopped, and if that is, as we fear, no longer feasible, that the Government of the Porte, should be advised to limit its proportions as much as possible.' ( . , 71. A. brief exposition of the British policy, as described in parsgraph 59 of this Trecis, was placed before the Secretary of State, with a request that the Government of India might be favored withithe views of Her Majesty's Gov ernment on the subject. * i i t Colonel Pelly directed to proceed to Bahrien. 72. Colonel Pelly on the 25th May reported that the commercial classes Secret I, Nos. 806-849 (No. 819). an d anxious, and that the pearl season would be lost. He en quired whether tribes who are parties to the maritime truce were to be allowedto undertake operations by sea on the interest of either party. On the 30th May the following reply was sent him (c Go to Bahrein in Hugh Rose, Magpie and Bullfinch to accompany.

Secretary of State's instructions with regard to preventing trucial Chiefs from aiding either party. 73. With reference to Colonel Felly's enquiry regarding trucial Chiefs, in the preceding paragraph, the Secretary of State was asked by the 'Viceroy on the 30th May ' If Pelly asks wkether he is to stop by force any military operations by sea on part of Chiefs, either for or against Turks, am i to authorize him to do so ? I advise this course, and that you should inform Turkish Government accordingly. This will not include Koweit Chief, who has already failed.' ,., „ 74.

He replied ' Pasha states Sheikh and tribe from Koweit voluntarily accompany expedition, part in merchant vessels part by land. No communication with other littoral tribes.'

The instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 74) to prevent ^ /&gt;T „ v Trucial Chiefs engaging in maritime secret, August , , o. .) operations having been communicated to the Porte, Sir H. Elliot wrote, on the 8th June:— 'Alt Pasha expressed his thanks for the communication, and having, in uniquivocal terms repeated his assurances that the Porte contemplated no naval operationsi said that H hid no intention of applying for assistance to any of the Chiefs included in the maritime truce. At the same time, however, the Porte, having no cognizance of the truce could not he expected to be held hound hy it, and would not hesitate to accept the services of any of the Chiefs who mightdender them.

Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf for the maintenancem — : — mm — 20 of the maritime peace. He was further requested to inform the Porte that the British Government intended to hold these Cliiefs to their engagements. Sir H. Elliot replied on the 19th July that he had already explained to the Porte the nature of the arrangements with the Chiefs upon the coast of the Persian Gulf with regard to the maritime truce, and had^ made it understood that Her Majesty's Government would watch over their observance. The engagements with the Chiefs contained in the State papers and 4 UertsleVs Treaties ' had, said the Ambassador, been communicated to the Porte, the Collection of Aitchison not being in the archives of the Embassy. Observations of Midhut Pasha on the instructions given to Colonel Peliy* 76. The instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 74) were com municated in writing to Midhut Pasha. Colonel Herbert telegraphed u Yours of thirtieth received, and purport communicated in writing to Pasha on 31st. His Excellency replies observing that- in instructions to Pelly meution is made of; Treaty existing 1 in name of British Government. He reiterates verbal communication that the object of expedition is expulsion of Saood from Kateef and Hasa, and restoration of tranquil lity there ; that Bahrein is not within Turkish contemplation. Expresses equal desire for protection of vessels and pearl fisheries in those w.iters, and states this is arranged as a duty of expedition. Expresses thanks that Pelly is instructed to assist in preserving order and tranquillity. Regarding independent tribes states, if not within Nejd, that is Abdoollah^s jurisdiction, present project has and can have no connection with them ; but that if any tribe, supposed to be independent) be in Nejd, and aiding Saood and opposing the Govern ment, although present design as above stated, it will become duty of troops to punish snch tribes. Declares non-existence and impassibility of existence of such independent tribe in country of Nejd. I write by post' Expedition prohibited by Pasha fxbm approaching Bahrein. 77. In reply to a query whether Turkish vessels would disembark only at Katif or Damaum, as contemplated in the previous March {vide paragraph 50), Colonel Herbet replied^ ' Pasha states the destination of the expedition being Katif, he has given orders to disembark the troops there, or, if necessary, at a locality close to it, which they erroneously called Ojair, name not known, and the orders having been so given, the Commandant cannot act contrary to the instructions received. His Fxcellency does not deem necessary to issue orders prohibiting disembarkation at other ports except Bahrein, which the expedition is pro hibited from approaching.' - ' Colonel Herbert, in a letter dated 24ith May, writes :— tc He [i. e., Midhut Pasha) assured me his orders to the officer commanding the expedition were that he should on no account turn his eyes on Bahrein, and if invited to receive hospi tality there, that he should decline such invitation/' Enquiries from Persia regarding expedition. 78. Mr. Alison on the 14th May telegraphed to Earl Granville— ' King is desirous of obtaining some assurance respecting Turkish expedition as affecting Bahrein/' In reply to this the India Office requested that the Shah might be made aware of the Grand Vizier's declarations regarding the absence of all intentions on the part of the Porte to obtain a supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, &amp;c. Non-interference in political questions enjoined on Colonel Herbert. 79. In a telegram of the 2nd June, Colonel Herbet informed Govern ment ' In the last number of the local Government journal eight towns of Oman, includino- Sbargah, Debay, and Abuthabi, all trucial, are enumerated in 'list of houses and' )&gt;ardpn« nf country of Nejd.

This is most desirable for securing- maritime peace. Any question connected with political position of States and tribes can only be discussed between Her Majesty's Government and Ministers of the Porte, It appears to Viceroy that it is understood between the British and Turkish Governments that the position which the British Govern ment has long held in the Gulf is not in any way to be affected by expedition against Nejd.' Narrative of events in Nejd up to date of landing of the Expedition. 80. The position of affairs in Nejd when the Turkish expedition was first proposed has already been briefly noticed in paragraph 61. Colonel Herbert's despatches of the 2ith and 2i)th March to the Ambassador at Constantinople contain a more detailed account of the secret h., 1871, Nos. 114 -120 (No. 117). state of patties at the time. In the former letter he writes— ' It is said that the mass of the people have joined Saood, and that he is master of the country ; white Abdoollah is reported to be a refugee somewhere to the north of the Jibil Shamar [the exact locality is not stated] with his uucle Abdoollah-ibn-Toorbi, his son Toorki, and a handful of followers. ' It does not appear that any further battle has taken place. ' After the successes of Saood, as reported in my letter above mentioned,* the garrisons of * This allusion is to a previous letter of Colonel the two foits of liil -Ilasa and of that of Kateef Herbert's dated 20th. February 1871, No. 6, to the gave up to him these places with all the treasure Ambassador at the Porte. contained in thfm. ' Abdoollah, after his flight from Riadh, was heard of as encamped at a place called Tieb- ism, about 150 miles south-west from Sook-oos-Sheookh on the Euphrates, with a force of about the same numerical strength as that of his brother, composed of Arabs of the tribes of the Shammar, Anezah, and El Kahtan ; but this gathering appears to have had no adhesion, and to have melted away, the Arabs all going over to Saood. and consequently Abdoollah was obliged again to fly. ' It is reported that Bunder-ibn-Rashid, Sheik, of the Jibil Shammar, has made his sub mission to Saood, sending him, in charge of his brother, an offering of 20 mares, and that he has beeu summoned to attend in person. te Sheikh Feysul left two brothers, Abdoollah-ibn-Toorki, above mentioned, and Juloo- ibn-Toorki. ' The former, as reported, is with Abdoollah, the latter is in Kiadh ; but he has sent his son Saood to join the new Chief, and holds Riadh in his name. ' Abdool Rehman, the fourth son of Peysul, is reported to have joined his brother Saood at El-Hasa, as also Mahboob, the former Minister of Feysul, and all the principal persons of the place. ' It is said that, on Abdoollah applying for aid to the Shereef of Mecca, the latter wrote to Bander-ibn-Rashid and to Sheikh Zamil, Chief of Anezah in Kaseem, to join and support him; but both excused themselves. ' Sheikh Zamil, having in farmer years suffered much from the oppression of Feysul and his sons, Abdoollah and Mahomed, particularly in the prolonged siege of his native city and the slaughter of many of the inhabitants about eight years ago, is unlikely to permit to pass the opportunity of supporting the cause of a Chief from whom he may reasonably hope for more generous treatment. ' Saood is stated further to have nominated a friend of his own, Hassan-ibn-Abd-ool Mohsen, whose family has suffered terribly at the bands of Abdoollah, as Sheikh of his native city of Bareida in Kaseem in the room of Mahomed-us-Sudeeri, an adherent of Abdoollah, who has retired to Sudeer. ' It now appears that the letters from Midhut Pasha to Abdoollah, which I previously mentioned as having been sent by the Muteserif of Bussorah, contained offers of assistance and a promise to send troops to his support if Abdoollah would despatch a confidential person to act as their guide, ' These letters, contrary to my expectation, reached their destination, in accordance with them, Abdoollah despatched one of his followers, named Abd-ool-Aziz Babtein, with presents consisting of horses and other things. [C967FD] f22 This messen^pr was, howBVGr, plundered about two daiys^ distajiice fvom Zobair, which place he reached on foot, and he arrived at Baghdad empty-handed on the morning of the iiind instant. ,, 81. In his letter of the 26tli April Colonel Herbert said— 11 From Nejd I have obtained no reports which I can submit as authentic, but those that have reached me state that Abdoollah has again visited Riadh, and that, with the assistance of his uncle, Abdoollah^ibn-Toorkit he has collected together about 9,000 men. tt It is also rumoured that Saood has with him some 70,000 or 80,000 men, and that he is marching to encounter his brother's small force. ' Should his gathering number even one-half of that stated, he will be in a position to offer a formidable resistance to the Ottoman troops, who will not number above bl,U00 or 10,000 men, while the nature of the country will offer him very great advantages/' Enmours from Nejd had reached Baghdad in the beginning of May that of the 9,000 men collected by Abdullah, the whole had deserted him on hearing that the Ottoman troop were coming into the country at his request. The feeling of the country was almost entirely with Sand. Narrative of the Expeditionary force up to date of landing in Sejd. 82. According to Colonel Herbert's despatch of the 24th March, Midhut Pasha appeared at first to hesitate in supporting the sinking cause of Abdullah, at the same time that he was inclined to support him as the Ruler or the 44 Kaimukam ' recognised by the Porte. Three days later Colonel Herbert, in consequence of a rumour that he had heard, sought an interview with the Pasha, who, he says, ' informed me that for a long time past he had been endeavouring to attract the attention of the Porte to the movement going on in Nejd and the adjacent provinces, and had at last obtained instructions to despatch a force to aid Abdoollah, the ' Kaimukam' nominated by the Porte. ' That this force would consist of three or four regiments, with one large gun and four or five mountain train guns ; and that he had called upon the Arab tribes, the Montetik Anezah, Shammar, and others, to supply contingents. ' That the troops would be transported from Bussorah to the coast in the corvette Bmussa, the guns of which would be available, and the two unarmed steamers Nineveh and Assur.' 83. Midhut Pasha apparently made light of this undertaking, and was evidently not aware of the brave and warlike character of the people against whom his expedition was being despatched, as he spoke of them as notnads, and anticipated that the steam-vessels would bo released in a month's time. Nor was he deterred by the expense which the Political Agent hinted would be heavy, while the treasury at Baghdad was in a very low condition. The Political Agent had, however, subsequently heard that the Pasha had received instructions to spare no expense. The Political Agent further remarked that it might be inexpedient to denude the country of troops of which there were never more than are absolute ly necessary, but this the Pasha answered by saying that he expected reinforce- ments from Syria; and as previously conjectured by the Political Agent, the Yemen troops were to take a part in the enterprise. It had, moreover, come to the knowledge of the Political Agent that troops were being brought from Constantinople, and that a vessel was about to proceed to J eddah for troops. This report had reached the Political Agent. ' in a manner which forbade his seeking its confirmation from His Excellency.' 84. A remarkable report had reached Midhut Pasha from Abdullah, which His Excellency believed, to the effect that Saud was supported by the British Government which had sent seven vessels of war to his aid, with the view of obtaining ascendancy in Central Arabia. Concerning this the Political Agent remarked— ' There ran be no doubt that there is a great wish on His Excellency's part, and probably on the part of the Ottoman Government, to obtain command of Bahrein and Kateef, and to23 establish the snpremaey of the Porte over the whole of Central and Southern Arabia; and this desire, together with a growing jealousy of British inflaence in the Persian Gulf, appears to be the motive of the present action.' 85. The latest news in this letter, althougli not at the time confirmed, was, that it was proposed to employ the present occasion to carry out the above object by taking permanent occupation of Nejd, a new division of the army being formed for this purpose, and by sending thither a Lieutenant-Governor. 88. Looking to the apparent popularity of Saud, the Political Agent, in another letter of the 11th April, expressed his doubts as to the wisdom of in terference between the two brothers, with the view of restoring Abdullah; and, regard being had to the nature of the country in which troops would have to operate in favour of the latter, he also doubted their chance of success. 87. And even allowing that the expedition did succeed, its effect, the Political A^ent observed, would be either to replace an unpopular Ruler in Riadh, andtfius prepare the way for his overthrow by his more popular brother, or facilitate the acquisition of the country by the Ottoman Government, a measure which they desire In either case, the Political Agent anticipated Uiscontont among the people which would be followed by complications. 88. The Political Agent further pointed out that, owing to a want of funds and scarcity of food, the latter due to a second year of drought, the province was not in a position to undertake a costly expedition such as the one proposed would prove. . regards the rumour about Saud receiving aid irom the Indian Government, the Political Agent said it was to be regretted that the idea had taken root at Baghdad. Midhut Pasha had never he said mentioned the matter to him, although he had reason to believe that His Ixcellenoy had endeavoured indirectly to ascertain his views. Hut he had taken care to limit himself to saying that he had no information, and expressing his conviction that Government would not permit itself to he led to intertere in the affairs ot tral Arabia. 90. In a letter of the 26th April, Secret, August i87i, Nos. 4i—7i (No. 5i). Colonel Herbert wrote :— ' i have the honour to report tliat the first detachment of troo f n0 fo ' said to be one regiment of infantry, and numbering between 4,00 and oOO men, kit this m the River Steamer Moosul on Thursday, the 20th instant. 'A portion of the artillery (without guns) and cavalry marched by land the next day; and on the 23rd idem a second detachment of infantry, considerably more numeious than the first, left in the Steamer Diyalah and her barge. ' A further detachment of troops is to go from Amarah shortly, and others will be despatched hence when the steam-boats return for their conveyance. « The whole of the artillery and cavalry are to march by land; and the guns, ammunition and stores are to be sent in country boats. 'A thousand horsemen are to be supplied by the Moutifik Arabs and contmgente of horse and n.atohlookmen are to be formed at Zobair and Kcweit from the tribes in those nei 0 b- hourhoods.' 9]. The same letter represented forcibly the di'Iiculties and dangers in store for the expedition :— ' On landing at Kateef, or Damaum, the troops will find themselves in the enemies' country, and, it must be anticipated, will find great difficulty m procuring carnage or supplies of any kind. 'From these ports their march to El-Hasa will occupy respectively four and three Jong days, and will be under a burning S un and scorching hot wind across saady desert where water for a large number does not exist. « The few wells that arc to be found at intervals, and are known only to the Arabs of the place, afford but a scanty supply o£ brackish water sufficient for the wants of a very limited number. ' It will be necessary, thprefore, that water be carried, and thus will demand so large a supply of camels as to be seemingly almost impossible. 41 The Beni-Khalid tribe who occupy this country, and of whom was Saood's mother, are probably entirely with him ; as are said to be the other inhabitants of this region.24 ' The difficulties of this march will unquestionably be very great; but should they be surmounted, all the necessaries of life will be found at El-Hasa, and there the troops may establish themselves. ' Thence, however, to Biadh the route is much more formidable. r The whole distance occupies seven or eight days' marching from morning till night, and of these four days and nights of constant wearisome exertion, with but small space of time available for rest and refreshment, must be devoted to crossing the Dahna or Red Desert, a tract so difficult in consequence of the extremely light nature of the sand, in which no firm foothold can be obtained even by camels, and in which no trace of passers is left; the entire absence of water, and the intense heafc and glare is to be dreaded, and, so far as possible, avoided even by wandering Arabs. ' But across this all who go from El-Hasa to Eiadh must pass, and water, fuel, and every necessary must be carried, while it is absolutely necessary to take ono particular line known only to persons constantly occupied in passing to and fro, an d any departure from which is destruction. ' This march will probably prove a worse enemy to encounter than the hordes of Arabs who may be expected to hang about the line (except only in the Dahna), and continually harass the troops without exposing themselves to the danger of an attack in force. ' There will also probably be great difficulty in procuring trustworthy guides, and if they be led by those bent on their destruction, their fate can be scarcely doubtful. *' The suffprings of the members of this expedition can scarcely, under any circumstan ces, be otherwise than very great, and it is a painful question how many may ever return. ' And while these troops are being thus sent to almost inevitable destruction, it seems that the Ottoman authorities, reckoning on success with somewhat overweening confidence, are forming plans for their future operations, and, as I communicated to Your Excellency yester day by telegram, are said to propose, after the capture of Nejd, to direct the expedition against Bahrein, Muscat, and the Arab coast in its whole length. ' 92. The attention of the Secretary of State was drawn to the above letter of Colonel Herbert, and he was asked by the Government of India to make a representation to the Porte of the folly and danger of the expedition. This request of the Government of India was communicated to the Foreign Office in England, and it was added-— ' If any further steps can be taken to convince the Turkish Government of what the Viceroy describes is f the folly and danger of the expedition/ the Duke of Argyll trusts that they may be taken with as little delay as possible. ' The Foreign Office replied that it was not then considered necessary to do so. Subsequently, however, Sir H. Elliot was desired to carry out the wishes of the Indian Government in this respect. 93. On the 10th May Colonel Herbert wrote :— ' Since writing on the 26th ultimo, I have paid a hurried visit to Bussorah for the purpose of seeing the preparations for the expedition, and found preparing to start with the troops the Steam Corvett Broussa, 33 guns ; the hitherto unarmed steam ship Niuone, in which four guns have been placed ; and old wooden guard ship the Khojah Bey, 18 guns, which was originally built at Bussorah and has long been deemed unseaworthy ; and three brigantines, also budt at Bussdrah, and carrying 4, (3, and 12 guas, respectively, and in little or no better condition than the Khojah Bey.' 94. Colonel Pelly telegraphed on the 31st May— ' My information is that expedition is already landed at Has Canoora, a sandy point, 10 miles from Kateef, and that Arabs will give first impediment at watered date groves'half way. ' • Observations of the Grand Vizier on the policy of the British Govern ment. Eemarks of the Government of India thereon. 95. The substance of a despatch No. 12, dated 11th April, from Colonel Her- Sect, a ugust 1871, No,. «-7i (So ,4 E ). ^ to the ^'^dor at Constantinople (vide paragraphs 86-89), alluding to the merely nominal character of Abdullah's dependence on the Porte and deprecating Turkish interference in Nejd affairs, was communicated to Ali Pasha, the25 Grand Yizier. M. Pisani. in a letter to the Ambassador of tlie llfch May, wrote that on receipt of this communication His Highness stated that the Sultan being recognized by the whole Mohaiaedan popu- ation as the only Khalir, as such he cannot allow the turbulent Sheikhs to become masters of the keys of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina without prejudice to his dignity and to the prestige of the Khalifat, and without losing his paramount authority over all the Mussulmans. ' Aali Pasha declared again that the Porte entertains no intention nor harbours any design over the independent tribes, but at the same time it cannot permit the Sheikhs to deal with their posse?sions as they please, and quoted the instance of Sheikh Saecd, who disposed of the port bearing his name in favor of a French Company for the purpose of get ting a ftw thousand dollars, and thus placed the Porte in an awkward dilemma. ' His Highness contends that the information of Colonel Herbert that Abdoolah is an independent Sovereign is erroneous and states that it can be easily proved by the date of the Sultan's ordinance and the firman by which he holds his appointment of kaimukam that he was named about eight years ago. it was not Midhut Pasha who offered to assist Abdool- lah, but it is the latter who solicited the aid of the Porte. &lt;' The Algerin^s, he went en to say, have not on'y the apparent desire to shake off the yoke of their present Kuler, but loudly proclaim their earnest, wi^h to return to their former allegiance, though no n tice is taken of their demand. ' Russia has, and still continues to subjugate provinces in Turkistan without anv alleged motive, and her troops a:e fat-t advancing towards the Indian frontier, and not a word is uttered or any step taken t &gt; prevent their progress, which sooner or later, said His Highness, will give serious anxieties to the British Government. ' Finally, Aali Pasha observed, rather in an angry tone, that in his humble opinion it does not behove a great power like England to avail itself of the pr tended weakness of the Porte to endeavour to countenance the Arabs and interfere in the internal affairs of Turkey, and which affairs are of vital importance to her. He repeated again that it may be reckoned upon that not the slightest idea is entertained of making new conquests or subduing inde pendent tribes. The Porte's sole desire is to restore peace and tranquillity in its dominions ; but so long as foreign cjuntenance is given to those turbulent Arabs, the action of the Porte, as a matter of course, is paralyzed, and the Arabs are encouraged in their illegal acts against the Sultan's authority/' 96. In forwarding M. Pisani's letter fp ffct* Earl of Granville, the Ambassador, ob served :— ' I have sin- e alluded &lt;o the subject in coversation with the Gr ind Vizier, and said that as his language to M. Pi^am hud seemed to indicate a suspicion that, the disaffection of one section of the Arabs was countenanced by Her Majesty's Government, i could assure him that there were no grounds for any such suspicion.' ff All that Her Majesty's Government desired was that the existing state of things in South Arabia should not be disturbed, and I had merely communicated to him Colonel Herbert's despatch in order to show the opinion of an impartial and competent judge upon tht&gt; impolicy of lending the weight of the support of the Pone to the expelled Wahtbi Chief. ' Aali Pasha replied that the whole sympathies of the Porte being in opposition to the Wahabis, bv whom they are looked upon almost as heretics, I would understand that tli« support which it had been found necessary to extend to their Chief could only be due to the importance of maintaining the influence of the Sultan over the Arab tribes undiminish&gt; d/' 97. Wiih regard to the observations of the Grand Vizier, and especially to the last two paragraphs, the Govern ment of India, in a despatch to the Sec retary of State, No.'40, dated 14th July, remarked :— ' Two points in this passage it would, in our opinion, be most inexpedient to pass hy witho it not ce : i.?/, Aali Pasha's words that no steps are being taken t^ prevent the progress of Russia towards the Indian frontier', and the implication that the British Government avails itself of the pretended weakness of the Porte to countenance the Aiabs in their iliegal acts against the Sultan's authority. * ' As regards the first point, we have much reason to fear that the false impression enter tained by Aali Pasha is not confine 1 to the Turkish Minisler, but general!)- prevails in Europe ar.d Asia. This circumstance adds much to the importance of bringing to an early and satisfactory conclusion the negotiation^ with the Kussain Government i n the subject of the boundaries of Afghanistan, to which we drew attpntion in our despitUi No. 33, of 16th June. We would therefore again ur^e upon Her Majesty's Government the desirability of asking the Russian Government to commuDicate as soon as p)ssible the purport of General [C967rD] G26 Von Kaufmann's reply to the letter addre&gt;«s o d to Mm on this subjeet in SpptemW last. We would at the same time suggest that a suitable opportunity should be taken by Her Majesty^s Government to inform the public of the assurances given by the Emperor of Russia and his Miuisters that they have no intention to extend the frontier of Russia to the south. ' With regard to the gecond point, we are of opinion that a strong representation should be made to the Porte as to the complete inaccuracy of the statements ma^e by Aali Pasha. This Government is the only branch of Britith Administration whicn has direct relations or communi&lt;!ation with the inhabitants of the Southern Const of the Persian Gulf, and we are anxious explicitly to state that no attempt whatever has been made by us to avail ourselves of any supposed weakness of the Porte, or to endeavour to countenance the Arabs in any course of action hostile to Turkey. No proceedings on our part can be interpreted so as to show the smallest desire to interfere in the internal affairs of those countries, and it seems to us that the expressions made use of by the Turkish Minister indicate that he has been com pletely misinformed as to the actions and policy of the Government of ludia' Porte informed Indian Government disclaim countenancing Arabs. 98. On receipt of the above quoted despafcli from the Government of India, the Ambassador at Constantinople was desired by the Secretary of State to do his best to remove any impression that might prevail at the Porte of there being a disposition on the part of the Indian Government to encourage the disaffection of the Arabs in the Persian Gulf. Sir H. Elliot replied ; 'Aali Pasha's expressions, reported by Mr. Pisani, and commented upon by the Governor General in his despatch t^ the Duk^ of Argyll, exhibited an irritation originating in a suspi cion that Her Majesty's Government were disposed to question the right of the Porte to act as it thought proper in the quarrel between Abdoollah and Saood for the administration of Nejd, which he regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. ' In the subsequent conversations which I had with His Highness I had made him understand that, although we might have our own opinion of the wisdom and policy of the course that was beingf followed with regard to the two brothers, he need not fear any dith- culties on the side of Her Majesty's GovHrnment so long as the action of the Ottoman autho rities was exerted strictly within the Sultan's dominions, but that Her Majesty's Government would not see with indifference any attempt to disturb the arrangements existing with regard to the Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf. ' The assnranc s received from the Grand Vizier upon that point were satis r actory, and 1 believe I had entirely removed from his mind all suspicion, if it ever existed, of there'being a wish on the part oil the Oovernment of India to provoke discontent against the Govemtuent of the Suhan. ' Server Efferdi, to whom I r communicated yesterday the substance of Your Lordship's despatch, showed himself perfectly satisfied ; but I took the opportunity of again warning him that the further avoidance of misunderstanding would depend greatly on the care shown by the leaders of the Expedition in not overstepping the legitimate limits of the Sultan's recognized dominions.' Turkish designs on Katar. Hoisting of Turkish flag at Bidaa. 99. Colonel Pelly on the 18th July telegraphed a report that while the Secret, August 1&amp;71, Nob . 147—301. (No. 175.) ^ a tar Chief CXCUSed ^ Mmself, his SOU Jasim had promised aid and hoisted the Turkish flag on his own house. Major Smith was about to go to Katar to as certain facts. On the same day Colonel Pelly telegraphed again 'that Captain Lodder ibid. No. 176. llad visite(i Sidaa on the east coast of the Katar peninsula and found the Tur kish flag flying. A Turkish steamer had come in with a boat of the Koweit Chief's which it had sent to the Bidaa Chief with a command to hoist the flag. On receipt of Captain Lodder's report Colonel Pelly apparently telegraphed to Colonel Herbert asking whether the Pasha knew of or had authorized this md. No 179. proceeding for he (Colonel Pelly) on the following day reported a statement of Colonel Herbert's, who said— Pasha states that being without news, he cannot say if flags have been sent to Gwuttur. Firmans, leing orders emanating from Sultan, have not been sent thither.'27 The allusion to firmans was not intelligible at the time, but from Colonel Herbert's letter of the 19th July, containing a more detailed account of his interview with the Pasha, it appears that the bearer of the flag to the Bidaa Chief was supposed by Colonel Pelly to have bad the authority of a firman from the Sultan. The Pasha's denial then came to this that no orders bearing the Sultan's signature had been sent demanding the fealty of the Katar Chief. It was not clear whether the steamer that had arrived off Bidaa was m Turkish man-of-war or merchant vessel, and Colonel Pelly was directed by the Government of India to obtain full information on the point. On the 30th July Colonel Pelly intimated— « Herbert having addressed Bagdad Pasha concerning Turkish flag at Gwuttur, latter replied his assurance had related to Bahrein, which would not be interfered with until settle ment of question between British and Ottoman Governments ; but that Gwuttur was not excepted like Bahrein/' 100. As already mentioned in paragraph 79 Colonel Herbert had been directed to make no communication on ihd. No. 23i. political matters to the Pasha. He was again reminded of these instructions and told— Ci except under direct instructions from Government of India, make no communication to Pasha on questions involving political or inter- lbtd.iso.2t6. national principles, or Treaty rights and duties. Report constantly by telegraph and ask for orders/^ Colonel Pelly was also directed through the Bombay Government to ' make no direct communications ti Colonel Herbert on matters involving political or international principles, or Treaty rights and duties. Such matters should be referred to Government of India by whom communication will be made with the Porte through the pro per channel.' 101. Later, on the 30th July, the following, was received from Colonel Pelly ' Magpie arrived. Major Smith found Turkish flag in Jassim's* house. Arab flag in Bin Thanni's at Biddeh. Gwutuur Chief explained • The Katar Chief. ^ j e ^ er Turkish flag was hoisted by desire of Turkish Commander, who sent it through Koweit Chief. Does not appear Turkish steamer entered port. Chief verbally referred English to Turkish Sultan regarding hoisting flag.'' 102. The Bombay Government on the 7th August signalled— u In despatches just received, Major Smith reported to Resident that he was informed that a Turkish Government steamer and Chief of Koweit in his own boat proceeded to Gwuttur bearing communication from the Pasha Commanding Ottoman forces in Nejd. 103. The Assistant Political Resident wrote on the 20th July regarding the Katar Chief— « Mahomed bin Tani, although heretofore well enough inclined, is old and infirm, and is influenced by his son Jassim with whom the pirate Nasir bin Moobarek is closely allied : both these men, it is known, hate the policy hitherto maintaned in the Gulf. They have long set their minds on pirating Bahrein, heuce the reception with pleasure of a flag that rightly or wrongly they suppose may yet afford them the desired opportunity.^ 104. In a letter to the Assistant Political Resident, the Katar Chief significantly wrote— 'We are people residing on the mainland and their (Turk's), forces are moving by land, and I have been required to accept this flag. I therefore did so/' The Katar Chief gave as a reason for flying the Turkish flag that he had not been protected by the English. This allusion was to the piracy of one of his boats by another tribe, for which he complained that he got no redress. Cololnel Pelly said that the matter had been enquired into. 105. The bearing of these events at Bidaa will be best illustrated by the following extract from the Poreign Secretary s note of the 19th July IS/I. t&lt; Some notice of Biddeh or El-Biddeh will be found at the places I have marked in No. XXIV, of the new series of Bombay Selections. It will be seen that, as early at any rate as 1827, and as late as 1851, it is described as a dependency of Bahrein. V\ hether it is so still 1 have no information, but at all events nothing is known here to the contrary. Esau bin Tanf, who settled with a section of the Uttolee tribe there, was a descendant of oife of the original28 Uttobee conquerors of Bahrein. Ifc will be reraurabered tliat the present Bahrein family originally came from Koweit, hence perhaps the attempt to establish Turkish supremacy over Biddeh. ' Biddeh, it -will be seen, is on the eastern side of the Gwuttur Promontory, a place to which the requirements of the Nejd Expedition can in no way require the Tuikish vessels to go. The occupation of it seems to be quire contrary to the spirit of the assurances g-iven both by the Porte and the Pasha. It is no doubt the first step towards the establifihment of supremacy over the tribes to the east, whose towns, His Excpllency will remember, have been • Fide paragraph entered in the local Turkish Gazette* as being houses and gardens of the country of Nejd. The Turks are too cunninsr t&gt;&gt; make any violent and sutlden assertion of their supremacy over these regions. There is first the insinuation of the Pasha that the assurances given refer to independent tribes, of whom there can be none in . . Nejd ; f then the entry in official papers of t 1 eparagrap certain places as dependencies of Nejd; then the hoisting of the Turkish flag, and so forth. My own impression is, that the Turks are much more anxious to establish their supremacy along the coast then to reinstate Abdoollah. The establishment of the Turkish ascendancy may be a good thing, or it may be bad, but at all events it involves a departure on our part from our past policy in the Gulf.' 106. No further correspondence passed on the subject of the proceedings at Bidaa, Government apparently preferring, in the face of the explicit assurances of the Porte, to look upon the hoisting of the flag as the act of an unauthorized and irresponsible person. Increase of the Turkish Naval Force in Persian Gulf. 107. In the Aden News-Eeport, dated 31st August, the following entry Secret, October, 1871, Nos. 54-57 (No. 54). ^ aS 0 ^ serve( i ' ' The Turkish Corvette Lebanon and the despatch boat Ishnderia, under Commodore Arif Bey, arrived here on the 27th, and left for the Persian Gulf on the mh. The Com modore informed me that he commands the squadrun on the station extending from Macuila to Bussorah.' ^ The Assistant Political Resident, Bushire, telegraphed on the 15th ibid No. 56. September ' Turkish Commodore A.rif Bey stated in Muscat that Turkish Squadron in Persian Gulf was to consist of 10 vessels. Name ot vessels arrived at ftwshixe—Lebanon corvette, hkenderia, gun-boat. The Turks had already one corvette and three unarmed steamers in the Gulf, and notwithstanding their assurances that, in regard to the Nejd Expedi tion, no maritime operations were intended, and that the ships were merely to be transports. J 108. The Resident at Aden had understood from the Turkish Commodore that he was to call at Maculla and endeavour to induce the Chief of that place to accept and hoist Turkish colors. In 1868 the Government of India brought to the notice of the Secretary of State the attempt of some Turkish officials to establish an influence there, and suggested that some representations mio-ht be made through Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, with a view to restrain subjects of the Porte from exercising undue influence or pressure on the Chief of Maculla, or threatening his independence. The Secretary of State replied, in his despatches No. 10, dated 1st October and 19th November 186^ that this had been done, but Government were not informed of the result Representation addressed to Home Government regarding the ab«v«.— 109. On receipt of the above information regarding an increase to the naval ibid No 57. strength of the Turks in the Gulf, the . . Government of India addressed the fol lowing representation to the Secretary of State on the subject: ' For this intelligence we were by no means prepared, seeing that the Turkish Government had assured Her Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople that no maritime operations in the .PersianGulf were contemplated, and that the vessels then employed in that Gulf were onlv ntended as transports for the conveyance of Turkish troops to some point on the coast whence, ^hey could reach Nejd.20 'Your Grace will readily comprehend the difficulty which the continued presence o£ a • No. 18. dated 22nd February 1870.

It would be to us a matter of deep regret that so faithful an ally as Turkey, one for the very existence of whose power England has made such sacrifices, should be the first to take a step calculated to alter a state of things, the maintenance of which we consider important to the interests of our Indian Empire, and from which, both in a political and a commercial point of view, the Porte herself has gained, and would continue to gain, so much profit without any expense on her part, 'We would, therefore, earnestly impress on Her Majesty's Government the necessity of taking immediate measures to ascertain definitely what is the policy of the Porte with regard to the Persian Gulf, and whether it is their intention to constitute it for the future one of their naval stations. If any such intentions have been formed by the Government of His Majesty the Sultan, it is, in our opinion, necessary that the objections which we have stated at considerable length in our previous despatches should be fully laid before them, and that no effort should be spared to induce them to abstain from a line of policy the adoption of which we could not contemplate with indifference, and which, we believe, would be injurious to the be.t interests of Turkey herself.' 110. The following statement of the naval strength of the Porte was given to Colonel Pelly by the Turkish Commodore a Coramodore^ a4'»&amp;p corvette, 17 guns, at [n Noveraher 1871. Colonel Pelly wrote:— M (&gt;un-vessel, 8 guns, at Bahrein. • ' The Turkish squadron now in the Gulf the « Sabel used as the Pasha 'i steamer. Commodore enumerated as per margin. He added ' Ashur ^ that two more corvettes were under orders from ' Oloos ) ^ ' Constantinople for the Gulf. He mentioned that ' Corvette Srousta, under orders to Bombay for a £ Busreh docks and a powder magazine were being repairs.' constructed for the squadron.' 111. The Political Agent at Maskat informed Colonel Pelly in September 1871 that he had been told by the Turkish Commodore that in addition to the Lebanon and Skenderia several more vessels of war would be stationed in the Persian Gulf; the future strength of the squadron, said the Commodore, would be 10 vessels. A despatch t was addressed t No 80. dated 20th December i87i. the Governmen t of India to the Secre tary of State urging the advisability of an enquiry through Her Majesty's Ambassador as to whether there was any truth in this statement. Movements of British vessels. 112. The Government of India was at first disinclined to send a vessel of war to the Gulf as suggested by Colonel Secret i., 1871, N ob . 681 655. p e iiy ^ telegram dated 11th April, the reason being that-— « If a vessel were present and the Turks were, without challenge on our part, to act against our views and wishes, this would be equivalent to an abandonment of our policy.

On the 28th April the Bombay Government were asked what men of war were available for service in Gulf. They replied • ' The gun-boats Clyde and Huffh Rose in Gulf.

On the 8th June Colonel Pelly signalled that the Bullfinch had arrived at Bahrein on the 3rd, and that he purposed proceeding in company with the Hugh Hose to Katif. 122. The Magpie was reported to be at Jask on the 5th June and on the point of leaving for the Gulf. The Lynx arrived at Angaum on the 16th J uly. 123. From this time there appears to have been no difficulty regarding the vessel required for the Gulf. Before leaving Bahrein for Bushire Colonel Pelly, on the 16th December, requested the Senior Naval Officer to have one vessel uninterruptedly present in Bahrein Harbour in order to watch events and afford moral support to the Chief. The instructions of Government with regard to the course to be pursued in the matter of the murder of the Turkish messenger were communicated to the Senior Naval Officer, who was also asked to let a vessel of war show itself off El Bidaa where the Turks were then about to land troops. Communication was to be kept up with the tracial Chiefs on the Pirate Coast. Case of the ' Snipe ' 124. Colonel Pelly on the 1st July telegraphed that the Snipe, said by o . » . io«, v i.Koni him to be a British ship had arrived in Secret, August 1871, Nos. 147-301. i-j i • -i i • i (No. 159.) Bushire roads, having on board some 20 Turkish troop. The Commander of the Bullfinch, then at Bushire, presumed she would not be allowed to proceed. The Hon'ble J. E. Stephen gave the following opinion on the case. He said :— The case strikes me thus : The Snipe is carrying contraband of war for the Turks- This exposes her to seizure by the Arabs, but I do not see how it authorizes a British cruiser to interfere. British cruisers never interfered with the British ships which chose to run the northern blockade into Charleston. u No doubt the maritime truce puts us in a singular position in the Gulf ; but surely Persia is not a party to it, nor does it extend so far north as Bushire. ' As at present advised, I think Pelly should be told to permit the Snipe to proceed warning her Commander that he will not be protected if the Arabs attack him/' 125. Government, accordingly, on the 2nd July, directed the Commander of the Bullfinch to allow the Snipe to proceed, but to warn the Master that he was liable to hostile seizure. On the same date the Ambassador at Constanti nople was informed of what had occurred, and it was added :— ' It would be desirable that the Turkish Government should abstain from employing British vessels in such a manner in the Gulf. Can a friendly remonstrance be made to that effect I' 126. Sir H. Elliot on the 6th replied :— ' Orders have been seat to Midhut Pasha to abstain as much as possible from employing British vessels for transport of Turkish troops destined for Nejd Expedition.^ In a despatch of the same date to Lord Granville, Sir H. Elliot wrote :— ' I communicated the substance of it ' [i.e., the telegram from India) to Server EfEendi, and pointed out that the employment of vessels bearing the British flag in carrying troops engaged in an expedition of this nature would give rise to erroneous interpretation by the native tribes upon the coast, and that I should be glad if he could meet the wishes of Lord Mayo in the matter. ' His Excellency said that, without taking a positive engagement that British vessels should not be employed at all, if there should be a necessity for it, he would desire that they should not be engaged for the conveyance of troops, if it could be avoided.' 127. Erom a telegram of the 3rd July, however, it appeared that the Snipe was not a British vessel. Colonel Herbert signalled :— ' Ottoman Government has engaged Ship Snipe bearing British flag, said to be property of Hajee Jaber, Persian Governor of Mohamrah, for conveyance of correspondence and com missariat supplies to Kateef, under contract to reach on 4th instant, having put into Bushire, she is reported as detained by Anglo-India authorities. Midhut Pasha requests she may be set at liberty. Please reply immediately.' 128. Noting on the telegram the Eoreign Secretary observed :— ' This telegram very much alters the aspect of the ease. It appears she is not a British tcssc I j but belongs to one of the local Persian Governors^ and unauthorizedly sails under the32 British flag. She is, therefore, liable to be forfeited to Her Majesty under Spction 103 of 17 and 18 Vic., Cap. 104. Colonel Herbert should, I think, be called upon to report specifically as to the nationality of the vessel ; and if she turns out to be Persian, Mr. Alison should be moved to remonstrate and obtain orders forbidding the Governor of Mohamrah, or the owner, from flying the British flag. If she persists in flying it, she should be confiscated.' The Hon'ble J. F. Stephen remarked ' The Section referred to is very difficult to construe, inasmuch as its terms would appear to authorize the seizure by an English cruiser of a French ship which hoisted the English flag. I do not think that this can be the meaning of the Act. It must, I think, be supposed that the Act was meant to agree with the rules of international law, and by those rules nothing will justify the seizure of a foreign vessel, except some act (such as running blockade, carrying contraband of war, or the like) which is an offence against international law. The mere assumption by a ship of one nation of the flag or national character of a different nation is not, so far as I know, an international offence which would by itself warrant seizure, and the municipal law of England would not extend, unless the very clearest intention to extend it was apparent from its terms, to foreign ship?. Of course Parliament could pass a law that every French ship which hoisted an English flag should be seized and forfeited ; but to do so would be an act of war, and it cannot be supposed that it is the intention of the Merchant Shipping Act to authorize such an act. 1 think, therefore, that the section must be read thus *' If any person uses the British flag and assumes the British national character on board any ship subject to thg law of England, owned in whole, or in part, by any persons not entitled by law to own British ships for the purpose of making such ship appaar to be a British ship, shall be forfeited to Her Majesty. The following considerations favor this view :—Section 18 provides that ' no ship shall be deemed a British ship' unless she belongs wholly to natural bom British subjects or denizens. In a wider sense, a ship own*d by persons owing a temporary allegiance to the Queen as residents in England, either in whole or in part, would be a British ship, and, as such, would be liable to hostile capture. There is, therefore, a class of ships to which the section would apply, vtz., British ships in the more general sense of the words, as opposed to Brifcish ehips as defined by Section 18. ' In Phillimore's International Law, Volume IV, page 601, an account is given of 'those sections of the Merchant Shipping Act which bear in any degree upon questions o£ Maritime International law.' 'Section 103 is not mentioned but Sections 527 and 528, which authorize the arrest of foreign ship under certain circumstances, are referred to. Those sections are in part iis follows :— f Whenever any injury has, in any part of the world, been caused to any property by any foreign ship, i£ at any time thereafter such ship is found in any port or river of the United Kingdom, or within three miles of the coast thereof, the ship may be detained. When foreign ships are referred to, care is taken to name them expressly, and to confine the power of dealing with them to the case of their being within the Queen's jurisdic tion/ • ' ' Again, the section in question (103) exempts the ships referred to from seizure if they hoist the British flag ' for the purpose of escaping capture by an enemy or by a foreign ship of war in the exercise of some belligerent right/ ' A ship would hardly wish to hoist the British flag (except as a stratagem, which I do not think is the case intended) unless it was in some sense a British ship—a British ship, that is, as against foreigners, though not within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act.' u Finally, Part II of the Act applies, by Section 17, to ' the whole of Her Majesty's domi nions/ Neither Bushire nor the shore of the Persian Gulf, nor the High Seas are part of Her Majesty's dominions. I think, therefore, that, even if the Section applied to the Snipe, she ought not to be seized out of Her Majesty's dominions.' 129. Colonel Herbert ascertained that the Snips was a registered British vessel belonging to Messrs. David, Sassoon &amp; Co. of Bombay. That firm, on being asked for information with regard to the vessel, replied We have to state that the Snipe was purchased in London by our firm there, on account of Hajee Zainel Abadeen, a naturalized British subject, in accordance with his instructions. Our firm registered the steamer in our name, and valued for the cost in bills in our favour with instructions, when the bills are paid, to transfer the Snipe to his name. Hajee Zainel Abadeen paid us the cost of the steamer by instalments up to November 1870, and on the 22nd of the same month we made the bill of sale in his name, immediately after which the Snipe sailed from Bombay, and returned only last month. W e, therefore, had no opportunity till now to get the register made out in his name, which, however, has now been done.' 130. The Commander of the vessel deposed :— ' The steamer is now registered in the name of Ruben David Sassoon, of London • a Power of Attorney is held by the firm in Bombay. In October or November last she was33 transferred by bill o£ sale to Hajee Zenail Abadeen, British subject o£ Bombay. Declaration of ownership was lodged by me at the time in the Master Attendant's Office, Bombay. I was going to sea at once, and I was informed by the Master Attendant that, as there was a pro bability of the ship being sold to some Persians, all that would be necessary, after the money was paid, would be for the register to be handed in, when it would be cancelled. ' In the meantime the negociations with the Persians fell through, and I am now authoriz ed by the owner, Hajee Zenail Abadeen, to take out a new register. During the whole of my absence I have looked upon him as my owner. I have remitted as. much as Rs. 20^000 or Rs. 25,000 to him when coaling at Aden, and for stores at Kurrachee I drew upon him/' Secret, December 1871, Nos. 1«153. (No. 156), * 13X. TIlG Bombciy GrOVGrniUGnt, ill &amp; ♦ Page 234. Eesolution dated 27th July, observed* :— ' It would'appear that the owner of the S. S. Snipe is a British subject. There have been negociations for the sale to Persian subjects, and apparently in anticipation of these negociations being perfected, it was proposed to register the vessel in the names of the proposed transferees, which Captain Pryce refused to permit, as the sale was not complete and the persons named were foreigners.' In a letter of tlie 29th December 1871 Colonel Pelly incidentally men tioned that he had been informed that the Turkish authorities had purchased the Snipe. 132. Murder of a so-called Turkish Messenger at Bahrein. On the 12th September Colonel Pelly forwarded certain papers regarding 0 x t% v 10^1 xt the seizure and death of an Arab of the Secret, December 1871, Nos. 154-165. -r» • tt • • • j m ^ n i - -n n i Jiem Ha] jir tribe at a nshing village called Ageria on the south-west end of the Bahrein Island, He had already informed Government of the occurrence by a telegram dated 1st September :— ' The several accounts of the matter,' said Colonel Pelly in his letter, ' are not alto gether consistent one with another. But I gather generally that Nassir-bin-Mobarek, the escaped pirate of 1869, sought service with, or the patronage of, the Turkish Commander at Lahsa ; that he was more or less received into favour by the Commander ; that eventually Nassir -bin-Mobarek, wishing to communicate with Gwuttur, selected a messenger from that tribe to which he (Nassir) himself belonged on his mother's side, viz.y the Beni Hajjir ; that this messenger was accordingly charged with letters by Nassir and proceeded to Ojair ; that at Ojair the messenger embarked on board a Kowait boat, in company with a fleet of Bahrein boats which were returning home ; that wanting water, or for other purpose, the Kowait boat, together with the Bahrein fleet, put into Ageria on the Bahrein coast; that, while there anchored, it came to the knowledge of one or more of the relatives of the late Chief of Bahrein, Ali -bin-Khuleefa, that the messenger was the very man who had killed or aided in killing the late Chief in the piratical attack of 1869; that in accordance with Arab laws of vengeance (and, as the present Chief asserts, without in the first instance referring to him) the relatives of the late Chief seized and killed the messenger ; that the clothes of the messenger were then searched and found to contain letters addressed as follows t In command of Turkish Troops. ' From Fereck Pashaf to Jassim-bia-Maho- X Son of Katar Chief. med binj Sanee. « From Nassir-bin-Mobarek to ditto ditto.

' The Chief of Bahrein subsequently enclosed the letters taken from the messenger a corpse for my perusal, in original. i returned these letters to the Chief with a note, of which a copy is appended.' [C967rD] J34 On the 15th October Colonel Herbert V' 3 telegraphed;— ' Pasha* privately asks my opiaioh. A messenger from Turkish General at Lahsa ♦ Proceedings (Secret), December 1871, fcdk lU- with letters from GWttttut visited Bahrein. 165. Sheikh heard of, seized, and killed him. British officers 'hearing this demanded letters and forwarded theM to GwUttur. Pasha cordially ackuowledges obligation. He wishes to obtain fitting reparation from Sheikh, but considers to apply officially to British Government would be yielding a point as to political position of island. Under existing circumstances, and promises recently given, he cannot use force against Sheikh as an Ottoman dependent, consequently contemplates sending a Commission to demand reparation. 1 request orders.^ Colonel Herbert was informed on the 17th idem of Colonel Felly's version t ind No. 157. of the story and directed, if possible, ibid, jvo . i6i. ^ to avoid discussion with the Pasha until further enquiry could be made; only if pressed, was he to tell the other version. On the 24ith October Colonel Herbert informed Go^ernmentt ' Midhut Pasha expects to leave Thursday, and it is probable he will make the death of the messenger a pretext for interference at Bahrein if he receive from me no satisfactory com munication before he goes.' Colonel Pelly was directed to proceed to Bahrein or send his Assistant there, and the following reply was sent to Colonel Herbert by telegraph of the 30th ' Viceroy cannot suppose that Pasha, knowing views of British Government regarding Bahrein, and explicit denial of Ottoman Government of all intention to extend supremacy, over Bahrein, and remembering assurances given by Pasha himself, can entertain any intention of interfering with that island. Viceroy would consider such to be a violation of instructions believed to have been given to Pasha from Constantinople, and of the promises given by his Government, and would not look on interference with indifference. ' Use your discretion as to expressing above views to Pasha. Inform him of Pelly's ver sion of storyZ'' The Pasha had, however, left Baghdad for Basrah en route to Nejd when the telegram reached, and Colonel Herbert considered that it would be incon venient to make the communication through a third party. He subsequently, however, requested the Agent at Basrah to wait upon the Pasha on arrival and communicate the substance of the above message. 134. The Bombay Government, on the 5th November, telegraphed :— ' Pelly telegraphs for instructions whether action is limited to watching events. In my opinionj if, after all our representations at Constantinople and assurances at Bahrein, we eon- tent ourselves with Watching events, our position in Gulf will be in future untenable. If force sufficient, I would not hesitate to instruct Pelly to prevent any Turkish occupation, and am confident that if this were known, not a blow would be struck. But some of the Turkish corvettes are of modern construction and heavy armament, and I do not know what Lynx and Magpie carry. In this case I should direct Pelly to visit Midhut Pasha on arrival, learn his intentions, and, stating circumstances which excuse Bahrein Chief, offer good offices; if refused, hand him formal protest with memorandum for transmission to London and in Constantinople to the effect that Turkish Commander from commencement of operations employed and took . into confidence Nassir-bin-Mobarek, who instigated and laid revolution in which Chiefs father was assassinated. The present Chief having been placed on throne by our intervention, and Nassir conopelled to fly, it was inconsistent with friendly relations with this country to employ and protect a men who had fled from punishment at our hand; that Nassir having employed the man who murdered Chief's father to carry letters to tribes with whom we have treated, messenger had no claim to protection as an Envoy from private person, and has justly met punishment of crime. If Bahrein Chief had acted hostilely or without considering Turkish dignity, it resulted from employment of Mobarek; and if Turkish Commander proceeded to act hostilely, Colonel Pelly was instructed to protest, and denounce his conduct as inconsistent with friendly relations of two Governments. Exact protest may be safely left to Pelly, but it should be formal, full, and precise. Instructions awaited. I think squadron should be rein forced Bidlfinch here. Nimble Aden.' Colonel Pelly was directed to make precisely the same representations to the Pasha as that contained in the telegram of the bOth October to Colonel Herbert, and the Secretary of State was informed on the 8th by telegraph of the whole proceedings up to date, and requested:— ' Pray move Ottoman Porte instantly to send by telegram most absolute orders to Midhut Pasha and his officers to abstain from any active or armed interference in Bahrein,35 wWcb would be in direct breach of tbeir promises. Telegraph to me immediately precise in structions what course is to be taken if Turks proceed to use fort'e at Bahrein. This is very important.' 134A. On the following day the Bombay Government was directed ' Instruct Pelly to go to Bahrein with as many of the gun-boats as he can collect, ascertain at once whether any menace or threat has been held out to Chief by Mid hut Pasha ■or any of Turkish officers. Let him avoid discussing the murder of the messenger, which he must insist on being settled diplomatically. If Pasha proposes to interfere in Bahrein, let Pelly warn him that Bahrein is an independent Sta^e, having peculiar treaty relations with us, that the Ottaman Government have explicitly denied all intention, to acquire sappre- snacy over Bahreim and state the facts 'in regard to the messenger, but avoid discussion about him, and formally require Pasha before entering an active operations to refer Pelly s protest to Constantinople for precise orders. Oxfax Nimble, Magpie, zxA BuViinch to Lynx is there. Let Pelly report immediately what force Turks have at Bahrein.•' 135. The Secretary of State replied on the 20th November :— 'Turkish proceedings in Gulf. Telegrams of 9th and 10th received. Foreign Office have communicated with Turkish Government. Answer from Elliot is as follows :—November 14th. I have reminded the Porte of the assurance given by Ali Pasha that no intention was entertained of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, or of subduing the independent tribes ot Southern Arabia. Server Pasha has repeated these assurances, but says that Chief of Bahrein, havino- caused a messenger of the Turkish General to be waylaid and murdered on the main land Reparation will have to be obtained from him. Telegram ends. British Govermrent consider the Porte entitled to some reparation for murder of messenger. Better that this should be obtained by our means than by Turkish force. If necessary, send Pelly to settle matters on the spot/ ; He was informed in reply on the 23rd:— •' Ottoman Porte appear in error, messenger not murdered on mainland, but on island of Bahrein, and said not to have borne any credentials by which he could be distinguished as messenger of Turkish General. 136 The Secretary of State on the 27th November directed that Colonel Pelly should be sent to Bahrein to ascertain whether any and what reparation was 'due to the Turkish authorities. Colonel Pelly, who was already at Bahrein, was informed on the 30th Novemoer of the orders of the Secretary of State and he was desired to have drawn up and signed by the Bahrein Chief a full state ment of the fact regarding the murder of the messenger; he was also ordered:— ' Inform Turkish officers that the murder case is one that can only be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy and, if necessary, by arbitration, and cannot effect in any way t 0 po itica status of Bahrein. Order of November 8th to be adhered to. 137 The Turkish Commodore with a corvette and gun-boat arrived at Bahrein on the 22nd November, and it appeared to have been the intention of the Pasha at that time to go himself to Bahrein and raise the qaestion of the murder. The Government instructions of the 30th were anticipated by Colonel Pelly, who on the 29th November signalled ' Turkish Commodore having opened question of messenger with Bahrein Chief. Chief has addressed letter to Midhut Pasha for submission to Porte, giving true version ot messeng er's death Expressing sincere regret at the accident which happened ; equal regret at conduct of the Turkish Lahsa authorities in having omitted to intimate to him transference ofLa a rule to Turks and in having selected as their messenger an unaccredited person at b.ood i end nersonallv connected with Nassir-bin -Mobaidk, who had notoriously been ariive^concerned ^3'^' Chief ot Bahreia. Chief further regrets that this offic.al ^Lr Tould have been permitted to carry a letter, int.matmg to Gwottur to capture Bahrein. No further news of Pasha s movements inland. Government requested Colonel Pelly to submit a copy of the Bahrein Chief's letter, and the Secretary ot State was informed ot what had been done. 138 Colonel T'ellv's letters marginally noted contained a more detailed y account of the murder of the messenger. No. 1258-372, dated 23rd Novctober 1871. j u ' r, rvf I'-mnnrtfiTiOP fo No. 1277-375, dated 26tb November i87i. but added nothing ot importance 10 the information on which action was taken by Government. Colonel Pelly wrote:— ' I think it is wavely to be regretted that a Turkish authority writing from the Wahab i territory should haveselected a person of Naesir-bin-Mobarek's anlecedents to arrange tor the36 transmission o£ the letter J and I further think that, in putting into a Bahrein port, the mes senger challenged the chance of a retaliation which all Arab tribes babituully practice. ' It is in my opinion to be further borne in mind that it does not appear that any intimation had ever been made to the Chief of Bahrein of the occupation of Lahsa and Ojair by Turkish authority. ' From all that I have heard and seen of the Bahrein Chiefj I am persuaded that, to thff best of his knowledge and ability, he is most anxious not only to observe a strict neutrality in reference to the Turkish Wahabee contest, but is striving by every means to avoid any -mis understanding which might tend to enable others to fix a quarrel on him;' 138A. The letter from the Chief to Midhut Pasha was as follows ' A few days ago the Turkish Commodore anchored in the harbour of Bahrein, and I deputed my brother, Sheikh Ahmed, to proceed on board and welcome him. ' During the visit the Commodore, it appears, referred to the death of a man of the Beni Hajjir tribe, which occurred on this island some months ago, and stated it was the intention of Your Excellency to visit Bahrein in view to enquiring into this matter, as the man was a messenger sent by the Turkish authorities at Lahsa. ' Although myself at the time extremely vexed at the circumstances which led to, and were connected witii, the death of the Beni Hajjir tribesman, I refrained from troubling Your Excellency, or the Exalted Government at Constantinople, on the subject. 'Aftpr the remarks of the Commodore, however, to the effect that the messenger was a Turkish Government servant, it seems on all accounts proper that I should address Your Ex cellency. ' The facts of the case there were as follows &lt;f 1st. —About two years ago Nassir-bin-Mobarek, with a following of the Beni Hajjir tribe and others, embarked from the Katif and Ojair coast, landed at Bahrein, pirated the island, murdered my late father, Ali-bin-Khuleefa, the then Chief of Bahrein. ' 2nd. —About three months ago a man arrived from Ojair at a village on southern end of Bahrein and was recognized by some of the Bahreinees as a tribesman of the Beni Hajjir, related to Nassir-bin-Mobarek, and who had been concerned in the proceedings which resulted in the murder of my late father. These Bahreinees thereupon followed the custom which everywhere obtains among the Bedouins when at blood fued, and killed the man. '5^.—The tribesman's corpse was subsequently searched, and some letters or other docu ments were found on it, and were brought to me with a report of the cause and circumstances of the man's death. Among these documents were two at least, which I beg to particularize, viz., one which there was reason to suppose came from a Turkish subject; and, secondly, one which intimated to its addressee that ' the news is such as you would wish, and the Exalted Government are trying for Bahrein, Gwuttur, and other places to the detriment of the enemy and to the rejoicing of friends. You will shortly receive news which will gladden you'. As regards the letter from Turkish subject, I preserved it unopened, showed its envelope to &lt;he British officers then at Bahrein, and with their approval transmitted it unopened by the same boat in which it arrived to its addressee. ' As regards the socond letter (namely that threatening my island with capture by the Turkish Government), I perused it with equal astonishment and alarm. ' Such briefly being the circumstances of the case, and being now given to understand that the Beni Hajjir tribesman was a messenger of the Turkish authorities at Lhasa, I beo- to express my sincere regret that a servant of the Exalted Government should have been killed within my territory, and also to add an expression of my regret. ' JM.-That no intimation should have been made to me by the Turkish authorities at Lhasa of that district having pissed under the direct rule of the Sublime Porte. '2^—That when selecting a messenger who might have to visit Bahrein, the authori ties at Lhasa should have selected a man of a tribe known to be at blood feud with the Bah- reinees, and a family connection of Nassir-bin-Mobarek. notorious for having caused the un timely death of the late Chief of Bahrein. That the messenger should have carried no credential or passport whereby he- might have been recognized as a servant of Your Excellency's Government. ' That a messenger now declared to have been despatched by the Commander-in- Chief of the Turkish forces at Lhasa, distant only two or three days' march from the island of Bahrein, should have been found to be the bearer of a letter addressed to Gwuttur, intimatino- the desire of the Government of the Sublime Porte to capture my territorv. ' I beg the favour of Your Excellency's causing, at Your Excellency's convenience, the above explanation and remarks to be communicated to the Government of His Imperial Majes ty the Sultan.'87 139. With regard to the above letter, Colonel Pelly wrote :— ' The English version o£ the letter of the Chief of Bahrein is now enclosed, and I reject- fully solicit a careful pertisal of it, for it appears to me that while this document exculpates the Chief of Bahrein from any intentional insult or annoyance to Turkish authority, it leaves on the local Turkish authorities at Lhasa the responsibility of having selected as their official messenger a tribesman concerned, directly or indirectly, in the murder of the late Chief of Bahrein, and of having permitted this messenger to proceed to Bahrein unaccredited, and carrying on his person a letter, evidencing the wish of the Turkish Government to capture Bahrein; the time and circumstances of transmission seem to add to the weight of the above responsibilities.^ 140. In a letter dated 17th January, the Government of India expressed their entire approval of the proceedings of Colonel Pelly in the matter, and commended the prudence and sagacity displayed by him throughout the diffi cult business. 141. On the 5th January Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Bombay Govern ment. &lt;f Bahrein Chief has sent me reply of Baghdad Pasha to his letter. Chief anxious to rely on my advice in the matter. Please instruct me at early convenience if I am to counsel Chief.' 11)2. On the following day he signalled :— 'My telegram of yesterday. Pasha's letter to Chief demands ten thous and silver dirhems Hood-money, and seizure and confinement of murderer. If demands not carried into effect, Pasha able bv power of Imperial Majesty to give real and actual effect thereto. It does not anoear that Pasha communicated Chiefs letter to Porte as requested. Shall I suggest to Chief to make reioinder that he would submit Pasha's letter to our Government with request that in communication with Porte, amicable settlement might be arrived at, and that he would bind himself to accept settlement. 1 think that if reparation be demanded from Chief for death of messenger, ChieE in turn would have claims for indemnity for murderer of his father niracv of his territory, and plunder of British and other subject on residing island. Early Instructions solicited as Hugh Rose ready to proceed to Bahrein. In yew of the reouest tor early instructions I have,' intimated the (jovernov of Bombay, ■ replied that Pc ly should advise Chief to reply as suggested, and if compelled notwithstanding to pay money under nrotest and appeal to Government, Pellj; directed to gain time in order that orders of Govern- ment of India may be received if above instructions disapproved. 143 The Government of India replied to the Bombay Government « Inform Pelly confidentially. If thought advisable, Chief should pay demand; he Should do so in deposit to Pelly, pending further instructions. Any symptoms of intention to show force to Bahrein to be reported immediately for orders. Vessel of war should remain near island.' 144. The intelligence was communicated to Secretary of State on the 12th with the following request « Move Sublime Porte to refer matter to our arbitration. If indemnity be demanded, strict orders should be issued from Constantinople to Pasha to make no attempt to support, demand bv force or show of it pending arbitration. The demand if persisted in after explana- tion which Bahrein Chief gave Pasha may possibly open up_ whole question of messengers antecedents and liability for his previous acts in Bahrein. It is essential the matter be settled diplomatically and force be forbidden. ' I will advise Bahrein not to pay the demand pending arbitration, or to deposit it only with Resident in Gulf,' 145. Colonel Pelly, with regard to the instructions of Government, tele graphed on the 16 th *.—• ' Your telegram fourteenth. I think the proposed deposit might be misinterpreted, but cnlJrif instructions I would deferentially suggest that intimation of proposed reterence to 1 Pmtc shfuld be given tTPasha through Colonel Herbert, and that Ambassador to Constan- tinople be requested to move Porte to restrain Pasha from carrying threat into execution pending arbitration. Pasha's reply to Chief reads to me rather that of a disappointed aggressor threaten ing future retaliation than that of authority empowered to take immediate action. Government consented to this course and informed the Secretary of State accordingly, and it was added 'It is not a point of any importance. Essential thing »s for hid show or use offoice and to settle question diplomatically, I hope this will be uiged.88 146. The following instructions were sent to Colonel Herbert:— ' Do not discuss question with Pasha. Should he refer to it, say jou have been informpd matter has been referred to Constantinople, and in your opinion it would be best for Pasha to await orders thence. ' Report by telegraph anything you may ascertain regarding Pasha's instruetiona' 147. Under cover of his letter No. f |, dated 13th January 1872, Colonel Pelly enclosed the translated purport of Midhut Pasha's reply to the Bahrein Chief. It was as follows :— Dated ^ ^ amzaa 1898 reciered at Bushire on 4th January 1872. 4th December I87I. Tramlated purport of a letter from His ExOKtiiBWCT Midhttt Pasha , Governor-General of EraV tnd Nejd, and Com mander-in-Chief of the 6th Division of the Army, to Shhik Eg axt bin-Am , Chief of Bahrein. I received, while at Lahsa, your letter dated Ramzan, written at a time when the most respected AriE Bey, Chief of the Coasts under the jurisdiction of the Government of Busreh and that of the Peninsula of Arabia, visited Bahrein with several of the vessels of the Sultan's Government, explaining the circumstances attending the murder of the messenger, and have noted what you have therein set forth. ' The importance of this subject demands a clear explanation, and renders it necessary that I should send you an explicit reply to your statements and the details connected therewith. ' This murdered messenger, who was of the tribe of the Beni Hajjir and a dependent o^ the Turkish Government, had been engaged by the Commander-in-Chief in Nejd Nafid Pasha, and was especially deputed to convey official letters to the Kayem Mukam of Gvvuttur, Jassem-bin-Sani. He was proceeding in a boat, but from stress of weather approached' the island of Bahrein, where he was seized, his letters taken from him and himself killed. ' In your letter after acknowledging the fact of the occurrence of the murder, you men tion the reasons for the perpetration of this act to be— ' Firstly, that two years ago, Nassir-bin-Mobarek attacked Bahrein and killed your father and that he had with him the Beni Hajjir tribe. ' Secondly, you allege that the messenger aforesaid, on his arrival at Bahrein, three months previous, declared he was one of the Beni Hajjir who accompanied Nassir-bin-^.'obarek to Bahrein, and was one of those who killed vour father, and that the people on the south end of the island on ascertaining this killed him in accordance with the custom of the Bedouins. Taking it for granted that when Nassir-bin-Mobarek went to Bahrein he accompanied those people who ventured to commit the acts in which the Beni Hajjir were implicated, and taking it for granted also that the murdered messensrer was also among the tribe it is im possible for one to conceive that the messenger proceeding on service should assert' that he was at such a time with the tribe who committed the hostile acts, and was one of the murderers or confess to what may cause retaliatory measures against himself. This is sufficient to show' the falsity of the statement. ' Apart from the above consideration we must hear in mind that this messenger was entrusted with documents from one governmental authority to another, and allowing that Bahrein was not a part of the Turkish dominions, and that the people of that island were not under Turkish junsdiction or dependents of that Government, and that this man was really a murderer : so long as he was a dependent of the Government and the bearer of important documents it would have been in the first place necessary to permit him to convev his letters^ to their destination, and afterwards to communicate with the Turkish Government authorities in regard to the accused, and punishment demanded, when, in accordance with the requirements of justice, the accused, if convicted, would have received due punishment But if without any just cause this person is murdered in the manner stated, and afterwards it is explained that he was with the tribe who came to Bahrein and committed outraovs plunder and murder, such a proceeding is in the highest degree absurd, contrary to justice and a deviation from the right course. ' ' For example, if one or more of the people of Bahrein who frequent the coasts of Bu«reh Kowait, Katif, Ojair,.and Gwuttur be murdered by the Arabs of those parts, and explanation be required, it were to be said that the person or persons murdered were of a tribe who at certain time visited and plundered such a place, and were related to those who murdered our messenger, and such like excuses made, I would like to know whether such pleas would b accepted. ' If both parties concerned are dependents of one and the same Government, the party who ventures to commit such an act will be considered as a murderer, and would be required to undergo punishment, or, even supposing one of the parties to be a foreigner, would not thiscoutse be applicable to him ? Ceitainly it would be so. The above sufficiently answers the first and second excuses put forward in your letter. 'The arguments adduced by me in this matter would be recognized in every place, and are in accordance with all custom and rule, and in every Court in the world. ' But as regards the third subject mooted in 5 r our letter, to the effect that the murdered messenger was the bearer of a letter from the Firman Hrma for Jassim-bin-Sani, and that you sent the letter intact with the seal unbroken to its destination, you say also thac in opening a second letter you found that certain persons harl written it to another person in Gwuttur, mentioning certain matters connected with Bahrein, which you observed with regret. This letter, although written by certain persons to an individual in Gwuttur, did not contain matters of the nature represented by you. But if it had contained any such^ may God help us, it would have created mischief to the State. ' This question bad no concern with the messenger, nor yet with the person to whom the messenger was sent, but had reference only to the persons who indited the letter. Not withstanding this were the subject-matter contained in the letter as seen by you and quoted by you to this effect, m.— ^ That the enemy would be suppressed, and that friends would rejoice,^ it contained nothing injurious, but only what was beneficial to all mankind, ' If any fault can be found, it is in the fact of your having opened a letter of this descrip tion from one party to another, at a time when you were a person in authority. Your presump tion in acting in this manner would be objected to by every Government and stigmatized by every creed. _' As regards your statement that the messenger who bore these letters was not known and carried no passport, the idea of such a question as that of messengers proceeding from Lahsa to Gwuttur being known or unknown, competent or otherwise, for the first time emanates from Bahrein. It is well known that persons employed on the coast and passing to and fro do not carry passports, and that the custom of carrying passports has never been in vogue in these parts. ' What you have now put forward in argument is sometimes considered fitting to adduce as an excuse, under such circumstances, in great cities which you have not seen, but may have heard of. The excuse, however, had no effect, because it is not the practice to carry passports in these parts. It would appear you have written from hearsay without considering at all whether the excuse would be of any service to you or have any weight whatever. ' Notwithstanding this it was known from the address of the official letter which the messenger was carrying, and from the seal on the document whence the messenger had come, and whither he was proceeding, and on what business he was deputed. These circumstances naturally showed what the man^s business was. Your statements are consequently foolish, and call for no remark. ' What causes me more surprise than all else in your statement, that you were not aware of-the arrival of the Imperial troops at Lahsa and Katif, while arrival of these troops took place more than six months ago and the people of Bahrein, consequent on the protection and security caused by the presence of the troops, frequented tha coasts without interference and carried on trade. The steamers and other vessels also passed to and fro in the vicinity of Bahrein. I am unable to understand how these patent circumstances have escaped your ob servation, while I have heard so much of your good sence and intelligence. ' In conclusion, the man despatched for the delivery of important letters from one Turkish Government authority to another is well known to us of having left; also how he was made to deviate from his course, the way in which he was taken to the island of Bahrein, and by whose hands he was killed. Same portions of the actual facts remained incomplete, but these were ascertained during the mission of Arif Bey, and the evidence is now complete. ' On this account it is necessary that the murderers should be called on to pay the blood- money of the murdered in accordance with the custom of law, viz., 10,000 legal dirhems of pure silver, which amount should be made over to the Kayem Mukam in Gwuttur, Jassim-bin-Sani for payment to the heirs of the murdered. ' In any case it is required that the murderer should be seized and confined. If it were possible for me (to get this done), it would have been done, in order that in future such oc currences as these may not be repeated. ' My object is to be informed who the murderers are, and in what manner they have been confined. If these things which I have said are not carried into effect, and as you V have written that the murder was committed by the people of the south, I, by the power of His Imperial Majesty, am able really and actually to give effect to what I have said. ' I now await a decisive reply from you.'/ II i . 40 148. On leaving Bahrein for BusMre, Colonel Pelly ^ave the following instructions, dated 16th December,* to * Vide enclosure to Bombay Government letter, No. Captain Grant, Assistant Resident, who 378, dated 20tih January 1872, i .ca i u * j j.-di • • vi was lett behind at Bahrein, in case the question of the murder of the messenger should be revived. After informing him of the instructions of the Government of India, he added— 'I now entertain every hope that the Turkish authorities will not interfere with Bahrein ' Should interference, however, have place [and as providing for this remote possibility], you will in such event remind the Senior Turkish Officer present, verbally in the first instance, and, if necessary, by letter, of the assurance given by the Forte to our Government. ' If the interference should still continue, address to the Senior Turkish Officer the language of His Excellency the Viceroy contained in the telegram of the Political Secretary, dated 9th November last. ' Should the interference relate to the death of the messenger in particular, say you are instructed to intimate that this is a matter for diplomacy and, if necessary, for arbitration, and cannot in any way affect the political status of Bahrein. ' Your letter should go by direction, beginning 1 thus : The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting 1 in obedience to commands received from His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India instructs me to &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. 'In the event of interference communicate with me by steamer if there be more than one steamer at Bahrein, otherwise by special boat. * * * * *' It is possible that His Excellency Midhut Pasha may write to the Chief of Behrien concerning the messenger and other matters, in such event, please verbally suggest to the Chief the advisability of sending a copy of the Pasha's letter to me, and of his postponing reply until he hears from me/' 149. Colonel Pelly in a letter dated 27th January, to the Bombay Govern ment,! forwarded a draft of the reply t Enclosure to Bombay Government No. 1009, which he had recommended the Chief of dated 19th February 18/2. -r&gt; v • x i i x -r. i Bahrein to address to the Pasha, and which the Chief approved and despatched immediately. The draft after ac- knowdedging receipt of the Pasha's letter concluded— ' I have submitted a copy of your letter to the British Government, with the request that, in communication with the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan at Con' stantinople, an amicable settlement will be arrived at, and that I will bind myself to accept such settlement of the claims pending between Nejd and Bahrein,' 149-A. The Porte did not wish to refer the matter to British arbitration, but c + ,, -A-o „ c . wished that Midhut Pasha should settle Secret, May 1872, ^os. 61-8i. ^ ^ ^ ^ means of Agents. The Government of India thereupon decided that no opposi tion should be offered to a direct settlement of the question between the Agents of Turkey and Bahrein, as long as no force or violence or constraint, as by presence of a Turkish vessel at Bahrein, was used. Instructions were also issued to secure the presence of a British vessel of war at Bahrein during the progress of negotiations. Ultimately the whole matter was apparently dropped by Turkey. Demand on Bahrein Chief for surrender of two boats. 150. While correspondence regarding the murder of the Turkish messenger was still being carried on, the Turks found a new pretext for fixing a quarrel on the Chief of Bahrein regarding two boats which the Pasha pretended to have been irregularly obtained by the Bahrein Chief from Katif :— ' These craft/' wrote J Colonel Pelly, ' were, I believe, brought over to Bahrein by Saood }Vide Bombay Government No. 637, dated 31st bin Feysul before the commencement of the Turk- Janu*ry 1872. ish Expedition, and were presented by Saood to a certain person or persons in Bahrein.' Colonel Pelly forwarded translated purport of the letter from Midhut FtVe Bombay Government No. 637, dated sist Pasha, demanding surrender of these January 1872, boats. It Was as follows I 1 — ' I have just received a petition from Mahomed bin Hossein of Gwuttur to effect that Saood bin Feysul, when fighting (for supremacy) with his brother Abdoollah, seized forcibly [C967rB] L Secret, June 1872, Nos. 170-173.41 bis boats. These boats are now in possession of the people of Bahrein, and petitioner lees the restoration of these boats to him. n.; r 7 f&lt; I beg, to inform you that these acts of plunder are contrary to law and to the customs of the high Government. You know that the wish of the Government is to protect its sub jects and to preserve them from intrigue and oppresion ; specially as Saood has seized all boats by force, and whatever he has thus taken forcibly is in possession of the people of Bahrein who have become protectors of what this oppressor has plundered. Under these circumstances, such proceedings are contrary to the rules of civilzation and opposed to the customs of the Exalted Government. ' I tind it necessary to request you to ascertain who possesses the boats of the petitioner, and restore them to their original owner. This matter being one of justice, you should help in arranging it satisfactorily as early as possible/' 151. The Bahrein Chief replied u I have had great pleasure in receiving your welcome letter dated 20th Rarai!an 1268 an (j J . . . ^acember 1871 have understood its purport and your wishes specially in regard to enquiries being made res pecting the two boats which orginally belonged to Mahomed bin Hossein of Gwuttur, and which were forcibly taken possession of by Saood bin Feysul and given to the people of Bahrein while Saood was in authority. ' I have made enquiries, and find that Saood bin Feysuljwhen in authority was indebted to two persons of Bahrein, and in payment gave them these two boats. This is the true state of the ease, which I trust you will accept, as I am sure of its correctness/' 152. The Chief received* a reply to his letter from the Turkish Bey at • Fide enclosure of Bombay Government No. Katif, WllO, after acknowledging the 1010, dated i9th February i87o. Chief's letter, Wl 'Ote— ' : . ' ' ' ■ : ' 5504 £ j. . u ; &gt;; .V . f ' This reply is not accepted, as it cannot be admitted by law or custom. In reality I did not expect to receive from a person like the Chief of Bahrein,who, notwithstanding his need of being placed under the flag of Turkey, such an absurd and uncomformable reply. The Effendi (t.e., Midhut Pasha) before leaving instructed me how I should act. My request is that you will inform me of your final intentlm as to whether you will give what is required of you in full, or that you will not conform with His Excellency's wishes.' 153. Meantime certain reports reached Colonel Pelly, which strengthened his suspicions of the craft having been irregularly obtained by Saood. At Colonel Felly's recommendation, therefore, the Chief sent the following reply to the Pasha under flying seal througb the Katif Bey :— ' I beg to enclose, for Your Excellency's information, a copy of a letter I have received from Ali Beg, Kaimukam of Katif, purporting to be a reply to my letter to the address of Your Excellency, dated 8th Shawal 1288. ' I regret to observe the menacing tone of the Kaimukam's letter. As, regards the two craft in question, and which were brought to Bahrein before the arrival of the Turkish authorities at Katif, I have already communicated to Your Excellency what I believed to have been the facts of the case. ' As, however, I am most desirous that no possible suspicions should rest on me of in any manner conniving at or sanctioning any irregularity at sea, and as it has been asserted that His Highness Saood bin Feysul obtained the two craft in a manner which has been called in question, 1 am requesting the persons to whom Saud bin Feysul presented the craft to place them at my disposal in order that I may make them over in the presence of the British officers at Bharein to whomsoever Your Excellency may depute to receive them. On the 9th February Colonel Pelly signalled : Assistant Resident reports Bahrein Chief accepted my counsel and rejoined to Pasha accordingly. All quiet.' Eeasons for non-interference of British Grovernment in operations by land. 154i. Prom the commencement of the Turkish expedition both Colonel Herbert and Colonel Pelly had repeatedly secret, May 18^2, Nos. 52-88. expressed an opinion that the ultimate object of the expedition was the acquisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the [C967PD] m42 Arabian Coast. Writing on the 26th April, the Ambassador at Constantinople observed :— . , . . . ^ . 4. -r v • « a / t - jt . i. 'D V ib 1,00 f1-.P rpmifation of at! able and energetic aamimstrator, buu it he is Midhut Pasha has t P Colonel Herbert of extending the authority of the actuated by the destre attri n e make y me su ppose that any such project would be encour- P o rte, Icandetectno m shows him6elf excl , ssive i y senf itivc to any to impfya doubt ?£ the rights of the Sultan over N.jd d.tnots.' The repeated and positive assurances of the Porte denying the existence of any intention such as that imputed to them have already been to 1 paragraphs 62-67, and subsequent assurances to the same cflect w ere not wan - mg. 156. The Bombay Government, however, in a letter dated 18th July 1971, No. 1214, observed,, ,,,, « It does not appear to His Excellency the Governor m Connc.l that the assurances of the Turkish Government are as satisfactory as they seem to he regarded by the Government of India On the contrary, they seem to be founded on a claim which may be produot.ve of much complication hereafter, and which His Excellency in Council regrets to see adm.tted. ' Tie Port, proposes that Us only object is to restore the authority of its Katmukam, the H«ler of Neid His Excellency in Council fears it mil be found that thu coven a claim h the alUgiaL if all the IMoral ifnto.-The Amir of Riadh has rece.ved tribute from Maskat has never ceased to claim authority over Bahrein, the Gwuttur coast, and also Aboothabee. If Sheikh Abdoollah is restored with the support of a Turkish force His Excellency in Council, does not doubt but tbat the Amir's claims will be renewed, and, if renewed and sucoessftdly resisted there appears nothing to prevent Turkish interference with the littoral tobes. H.s Excellency iu Council confesses to apprehensions of great embarrassment for the future wh.cb probably might have been avoided if a more decided tone had been adopted acd Turkish intervention prevented/ 156. When the instructions given to Colonel Pelly {tide paragraph 72) were communicated to Midhut Pasha by Colonel Herbert, that officer wrote on the 7th June:— f 'His Excellency notes that Colonel Pelly is instructed to protect the pearl fisberies from all-kinds of interference and aggression, which, he states is also necessary on his part, and has been assigned as a duty of the expeditionary troops ; and he notes as a cause of thank fulness that 0 Colonel Felly is directed by Her Majesty's Indian Government to exert himself and assist in preserving order and tranquillity in that sea. ' I would here remark that the preservation of the tranquillity of the Gulf and protection of the interests of the pearl-fisheries have not hitherto been matters in which the Ottoman Government has assumed to itself any active intervention. ' His Excellency Midhut Pasha then proceeds to remark on the protection to be given by Colonel Pelly to ' certain independent States and tribes'; and while asserting that if such be not within the country of Nejd, that is, that under the jurisdiction of Abdoollah bin Feysul, the present project has no connexion originally or eventually with them. He adds, if there be within the Nejd country a tribe thus supposed to be independent who aid Saood and oppose the Ottoman Government, then, although the present object is only to expel him, the punish ment of such tribe will naturally become the duty of the troops. He then concludes with what must be deemed a solemn protest against the existence or possibility of existence of ao indepen dent tribe in the country of Nejd.' This, Colonel Herbert considered, became an important protest when taken in connexion with an article in the local Government journal. To this article was appended a list of the towns, houses, etc., in the Province of Nejd, and amon&lt;? the towns mentioned was Bahrein, as also three towns belonging to trucial Chiefs on the Oman Coast u This direct mention.' said Colonel Herbert, ' of Bahrein and a portion of Oman, as appertaining to Nejd, in a journal which can only be regarded as a Government Gazette, is an indication of the views of (at least) the local Government of this province, which, I think, justifies my want of confidence in the assurances bo repeatedly and explicitly given. ' If 1 mistake not, the whole of the country of Oman is deemed to belong to the de facto Government of Maskat, and it appears to me desirable that I be instructed as to the views of His Excellency the Viceroy in Council as regards this country, as it is not improbable that the question may shortly be agitated here. In case of the Porte obtaining, at least for a time, a nominal supremacy over the Province of Nejd, Colonel Herbert suggested that advantage should be taken of the occasion to brin? about a settlement of the long pending question of the frontier between Oman and Nejd.43 167. Tbe Bombay Government thought that the above letter of Colon ®l Herbert stronglv corroborated their previous view as to the possible results Herber^rytt^ and the 1 real designs of the Baghdad Governor- ( General ' Midbut Pasha,' wrote the Bombay Government, ' has long been known as one of the most able men in Turkey, bent upon extending tbe authority of tbe Porte wherever and when- Tver an opportunity presents itself.

'Tf 1ia« been Dointed ™t in the letter of this Government above quoted, that the Ameer of Riadh has always claimed a suzerainty over Muscat and Bahrein, and it now appears that t o l^Cr^'S^istincUv includes Bahrein and the country of Oman o the east within Nejd L?rlry It is impossible to foresee to what complications these pretensions ^ may lead.' ; ^ 158. The views of the Government of India on these points T^ 111 e ascertained by a reference to the following note of His Excellency e ice y, dated the 29th July 1871.

On arrival at Katif the Turkish Commander addressed a procla mation to ' all residing in Lahsa, Katif, and the provinces of Nejd/' informing them that Nejd and its dependencies form part of the Turkish possessions similarly to Irak, Yemen, Egypt, &amp;c. The ploclamation next went on to say that Saood having overthrown the authority of Abdullah, the Kaimu- kam appointed by the ISultan under the Baghdad Government, a force had been despatched to assist Abdullah and bring the people under his rule. Saud was promised pardon if he came in and apologized for his conduct: otherwise he and the tribes that supported him would be destroyed. The tribes that remained at Lahsa and Katif were promised favor and protection. Midhut Pasha had expected Abdullah to join the expeditionary force at * It turned out subsequently that the insecurity of Katif, but the latter Was either Unwill' the roads prevented his joining the Turks. illg or Unable to do this.* The Pasha told Colonel Herbert that he hoped to attain the object he had in view by negotiation and without the employment of force, and with this view he sent with the Expedition Munsoor Beg, formerly Sheikh of the Montefik, and several other influential Arabs to act as parlementaires. 164. Early in July the Turkish troops marched from Katif and reached Hasa. According to a report by one of Colonel Pelly's Moonshees, Fereck Pasha, the Turkish Commander, was 15 days getting to Hasa, owing to the heat and the illness of his men. The march of the Turks was not opposed, and the forts were all given up without resistance of any kind. Saood, who was reported to be in JRiadh with a large force, seemed anxious to avoid any collision with the Ottoman troops, and only desirous of drawing them away from this base of operations on the coast. Secret December 1871, ivos. 1-153 (No. 24). r , i iTTii- i. rw i -r i Colonel Herbert wrote on the 19th July. ' Whenever they {i.e., the Turks) may have established themselves in El Hasa^ they will, if he (Saood) be really as strong as is said, be almost entirely at his mercy, as he will possess the power of surrounding them and cutting off their communication with the coast. &lt;f A report, which seems to be reliable, has reached me that the Expedition lost as many as four hundred men at Katif from cholera and want of food. ' Provisions were scarce and had been damaged in. transit. The men are said to have been living on rice and water, and it seems they were in a pitiable condition when they marched from Katif. 4 It is further rumoured that Saood had utterly defeated Abdoollah, and that he has offered to pay tribute to Turkey, at the same time expressing his determination to resist invasion of the country. ' This seems to be generally believed to be true,' 165. On the 1st August Colonel Her- Ihid No. 2o. » . . bert wrote:— &lt;f It is stated thnt the force is much reduced in numbers by deaths from sickness and want of food, and is much dispirited. ' Sheikh Faleh, son of Nasir Pasha, Sheikh of the Montefik, with the contingent of Arab horsemen which had ascompanied the Expedition to El Hasa, reached Koweit on his return on the 26th instant. &lt;c It is reported that, from the time of joining the expedition, he had only received seven days' commissariat supplies for his men and animals, and on his applying lor help to the General in commanrl, Nafiz Pasha, the latter stated his inability to aid him, and recommendeJ his return with his contingent ; that they marched accordingly, but without supplies of any kind ; and that they lost very many horses on the way to Koweit from want of food and water. 'Munsoor Beg, Ex-Sheikh of the Montefik, Suliman Zaheir, Ex-Sheikh of Zobair. and Syed Mahomed Saeed, brother of Syed Abdool-Rehman, Nakeeb of Bussorah, are said to be on their way back, and therefore Nafiz Pasha, with his reduced body of troopsj is lert wi ou support at El Hasa. [C967ED]46 ' Saood is still reporte to lie in possession of Riadh and Nejd Proper. The whereabouts of Abdoollah is not distinctly known, but he is said to be not far from the capital, probably at Kharij, to the south, aud it is said that the inhabitants of the country are endeavouring' to bring about a reconciliation between the brothers with the view to their combining to get rid of the Ottoman troops. ' It is to be apprehended that the position of these last is very precariou8.' , 106. Colonel Felly's Moonsliee, writing in July, reported Abdullah to be two days' march from Kiadh:— ,f Saood,' he said, ' has no money and has expenses. Abdoollah bin Feysul is now located at a place called Akhremeh, two days' journey from Riadh, and has followers from the Nejd countryj and is also in want of money. He was originally anxious to be friends with his brother Saood ; but when letters from the parts of Bahrein informed him that the Turkish army intended to establish him as Imam, he would not consent, and is wailing to see what turn affairs will take, but was unable to get across to the Turks on account of the insecurity of the roads.' He added; 'Fereck Pasha is now at Lahsa, aud is unable to move further on account of the sickness, heat, and hot winds. ' It is said that if the people of Nejd join together, no one will be able to subdue them. But now they are separated, some following Saood and some Abdoollah, and that to a certainly their enemies will subdue them. 'At heart the people of Nejd do not like the sons of Feysul on account of their oppres sion and unjust taxes, and on this account they are now ruined. ' Ibrahim Beg has a following of 800 Turks in Katif, and has ordered the streets to be swept and watered. He has ordered bazaars to be established out of the fort. About 70 prostitutes from Baghdad were brought to Katif in the Snipe, and 80 wine sellers, and their business is flourishing. ' People say if the Najdees be certain of these proceedings, they may join together and fight the Turks, as the Wahabees do not consent to such acts, ' Some of the merchants of Katif have communicated these proceedings to the people of Nejd, and they will know that the Turks are of another creed. They are now assured that the intention of the Turks is to place Abdoollah bin Feysal as their Imam, and that their religion will rule as before/' 167. The position of affairs in the beginning of August is thus described by Colonel Pelly in his letter of the Mth of that month :— ' 1st. —The Turkish force is in occupation of the fertile district and ports of Lahsa; and the question is being discussed between the Commander of the forces and the Turkish authorities as to whether the Expedition should for the present remain at Lahsa, or whether constitutin» Lahsa an intermediate base of operations^ the Expedition should advance into Nejd. '2nd. —The Commander of the forces would seem to be in favour of halting where he is at all events, until the weather cools and rain falls. The Turkish authorities, on the other hand, would seem to be urging an advance, and contemplating an invasion of Nejd by a com bined movement of the forces now in occupation of portions of the Arabian Littorals of the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Should this alleged combined operation be successfully carried into effect it might have important results, and would seem to indicate an intention permanently to occupy Peninsular Arabia as a Turkish province. rf 3rd. —The Expedition appears to intend strengthening its sea base by the erection of forts at Ojair and in the neighbourhood of Katif, while the line of communication between those ports and Lahsa is to be secured by fortified posts at every caravan stage. ft ^.—Arrangements appear to have been made for the occupation of Gwafctur. But this region continues as yet in a distracted state, pressed on by the Turks, and harassed by the Bedouins, who appear, at the instigation of Saood bin Feysul, to be marauding or aggressing all along the southern flank of the Turkish line of communication. '5^.—The respective positions of the contending brothers, Abdoollah and Saood bin Feysul, do not seem to be certainly known. Neither seem to be in great force, while the tribes and the inhabitants of the Capital Riadh appear to be a waiting either the imprisonment or death of one of the aspirants.' 168. On the 28th August, Colonel Pelly reported two fights between Ab dullah and Sand. The latter was said to have been killed - and Saud wounded. The Turkish Commander was becoming uneasy about his communication with the coast and was calling for reinforcements, two or three hundred men had i ( I47 been pushed on to Ilasa from Katif and Ojair. Colonel Felly's estimate of the strength of the Turkish force was as follows : — In the Fort at Katif, of whom perhaps 150 sick ... ... 500 At Ojair ... ... ... ... ... 150 Reinforcement to Lahsa ... ... ... 225 ! 1 Head-quarters in and around the forts of Lahsa, of whom 1,000 sick 2 ,500 Total strength ... 3,400 Deduct sick ... 1,150 Effective ... &amp;,500 This he thought was perhaps over the mark. The Arab Contingent was about 2,000 men. Katar was being overrun by the Bedouins, who were also plundering between Ojair and Hasa. The Chief of Bahrein had ordered the Bedouins who were on the island to leave the place, and most of them had crossed over to Katar. Fereck Pasha had been raising recruits in Hasa and had got about 900 men at 6 dollars a month. It was said that Fereck Pasha had invited Saud to come to Hasa but the latter refused to trust himself there. 169. In September Colonel Pelly announced a report that Abdullah was not killed, but had reached the Turkish camps at Hasa. He certainly did reach the Turkish camp eventually, but when and how he got there is quite uncertain. News of his sudden death, not in action this time, was current in Katar in the end of September. Saud was determined to fight, and was preparing to march from Eiadh on Hasa. The Turks had received reinforcements at Katif. No movements appear to have taken place during October, but on the 22nd November Colonel Pelly reported:— ' So far as I can gather (and requesting always that all information based on native report mav Ije received with cu.ution), the position of affairs is somewhat as iollows i - It appears that Saood having approached Lahsa precipitated an action ; and alter some partial success was defeated by the Tukrish force at Lahsa. 'Snd. That Saood then retired on Gwattur followed by a considerable number of bedouins, who have now intimated to Mahomed bin Tanee and other Gwuttur Chiefs that they must elect between supplying the wants of Bedouins or having their towns or territory pillaged. On receipt of this news I gave our Indian subjects in Gwattur the usual warning. That Saud has sent Envoys to the Bahrein Chief in view to his receving asylum in the event of necessity. The Bahrein Chief communicated with me on this subject, and my advice to him has been that Saud should refrain from approaching the island in order to prevent any semblance of a breach of absolute neutrality on the part of Bahrein. Copies of the Chief's letter and of my reply are appended. '4^. It appears that the Pasha of Baghdad left the river about the 9th or 10th instant, proceeded to Koweit, passed a day there, and then came on with three steamers and a consider able body of troops to Katif, where he arrived about the 13th or 14th instant; that he is now at Katif with bis troops encamped on the plain, as Katif, like Bahrein, is plagued at this season by virulent fever, which is said to have caused much loss to the Turkish force, after it had ceased to suffer from cholera. « §ti % It is stated to be the intention of the Pasha to proceed almost immediately inland to Lahsa' but whether with the object of consolidating the Government at that point, or of forwarding the expedition towards Riadh, does not appear. Rumour, however, alleges that the Turkish authorities have issued a document, notifying the intention of the Turkish Govern ment to assume direct control over Katif and Lahsa to the exclusion of the Wahabee dynasty. It is, I think, to be borne in mind that the Turkish Expedition has not as yet entered the districts of Nejd, strictly so called/' 170. On the same day Colonel Pelly wrote that a messenger sent to observe matters at Katif had ascertained, said Colonel Pelly— 'that the Pasha of Baghdad embarked last night at Katif for Ojair, taking on board with him an escort of some three hundred men; and that it is the intention of the Pasba to proceed48 from Ojair to Lahsa. This report is confirmed by the appearance of the Pasha's steamer pasa- ing towards Ojair this morning. '2nd. —That the Turkish Commodore is ordered by the Pasha to hold one of his vessels in readiness off Katif, to send a second back to Busreh for supplies, and to proceed himself in a third to Bahrein in view to meeting me and for other business. That the report of the flight of His Highness Abdullah together with his son, Toorkee, from Lahsa towards Riadh is reliable. It further appears that His Highness' brother, Mahomed, had left Lahsa a few days previously; and that Abdullah left a letter for the Turkish Commander stating that the Turkish force having been professedly organized for his (Abdulah's) restoration to power, had been utilized to supplant both himself and his dynasty ; and that he would, therfore, no longer trust Turkish aid or promises.' 170A. On the 23rd November Colonel Pelly wrote :— 'Yesterday evening the Turkish Commodore anchored with a corvette and a gun vessel in the Bahrein harbour. He hoisted the Turkish flag at his m Q n and fired a salute of 21 o-uns. On being asked with the usual etiquette by our Senior Naval Officer as to whom the salute was intended for, he replied that he was saluting the forts on shore, and that as he had no Arab flag on board he had hoisted the Turkish flag. He added that he had done the same at Muscat, ''To-day the Commodore and I exchanged visits, and he was by no means reticent concern ing the expedition to Nejd. He said that the Pasha of Baghdad had proceeded to Lahsa for the purpose of enquiring into some complaints of alleged corruption, of settling the Government at Lahsa, and of arranging for the advance of the expedition to the Wahabf capital. It was unlikely that the Pasha would himself accompany the Expedition to Eiadh, but Pereck Pasha the Commander-in-Chief, would in all probablity move the Lahsa force there during the present winter. The Commodore estimated the Lahsa force at from 9 to 10,000 men indepen dently of irregulars. He said that the recent defeat of Saud had been decisive; that Abdulah and his brother had escaped; and that the Turkish Government would now probably depute a person of rank from Cpnstantionple as Governor-General of the Wahabee territory. He admitted that the Expedition had been costly, and that permanently holding the country could never pay, but he deemed the principal object of the Porte to be to rid themselves of Wahabi annoyances to pilgrims passing across Arabia to and from Mecca ; to accomplish this, he said, concerned the Sultan in his capacity of head of the Mussulman religion. ''The Commodore alleged that the road between the coast line and Lahsa is now so safe that single postmen pass along it. He added that it was the intention of the Pasha to erect a new town in the neighbourhood of Katif. He had himself accompanied .the Pasha in an excursion for the selection of a site, and the Pasha had chosen a position about four miles distant from the present fort of Katif, where sweet water is plentiful, and the surrounding country open/ , &amp; 172. Eeferring to Koweit the Commodore informed Colonel Pelly that the Chief had been regularly installed there on the recent visit of the Pasha, and that Koweit was declaredly under Turkish protection. 173. la a letter of the 4th December Colonel Pelly wrote . ^idhut Pasha arrived at Lahsa about eight days ago, and is said to have expressed dissatisfaction with the Commander of the Turkish Forces on account of the escape of Abdullah bin Feysul. Meantime all reports concur in alleging that Abdullah has reached his capital Riadh whence, as it is said, he has addressed a letter to the Turkish authorities complainino- that whereas they entered his country with his consent, and for the concerted object of reinstating him m power, they had practically placed him under restraint and purposed supplantino- his dynasty by d.rect Turkish Rule; that he had now escaped; but was still willino. to pav tribute and arrange matters, provided the Porte should acknowledge him as Imam' of the V\ ahabi territories; but that, failing this, he would endeavour to hold his owu. and that -Nejd was a country not easy either to take or to hold.' 173A. A notification was issued by Midhut Pasha that the al Saud had ceased to reign and that Nafiz Pasha teas appointed Mutessarif of Nejd. 174. Colonel Herbert in a letter of the 3rd January 1872 reported the return of Midhut Pasha to Baghdad on the 28th Deoemberl The Pasha brought back a great number of invalid soldiers from El Hassa and Katif. Colonel Herbert wrote:— 'The state of the garrisons at El Ha&lt;=sa and Katif is reported to be verv bad sickness prevails among the troops to a great extent, .and their numbers are said to be so much reduced that Nafiz Pasha is compelled to act purely on the defensive, and can hardly repulse the fre quent raids of the Arabs, who, it seems, continue to harass them even in the absence of !,h« principal Chiefs.49 ' Abdullah is reported to be in Riadh and Saud to continue in tlie neighbourhood of Gwattur, while a correspondence is said to be going on between them, though as yet it is not known that they have come to any terms. ' Meantime Midhut Pasha shows no intention of withdrawing from his aggressive, costly, and hopeless policy in Nejd. While at Bassorah on his way back to Baghdad he purchased from the Persian Governor of Mahomerali a steam vessel to run between Hussorah and Katif, and on the 1st instant a detachment of about 300 soldiers left this to supply the place of some of the sick men whom he brought up. ' This country is thus being denuded of troops to a considerable extent, and it is highly probable that these will be needed here in the spring. ' The Arabs are said to be much disaftacted, particularly the Sharamar, who are excited by the mode of execution at Moosul of their late Sheikh, Abdul Kurreem. Rain is now falling abundantly throughout the country and will fill the wells in the desert, and a rising is con sidered by no means impossible.^ 175. Colonel Felly's last news, dated 13th January, was that the Turkish Commodore had proceeded to El Bidaa taking with him the steamer Assur and a battalion of regular troops. These he landed at K1 Bidaa against the will of the Chiefs. Colonel Felly wrote:— ' This practical experience of what is meant by Turkish friendship may, perhaps, account for the Gwattur Chief having addressed a very polite letter to me.' The following report of the landing at El Bidaa is given by the Assistant Folitical Resident in his news gleanings 'The two Turkish ships at El Biddeh saluted and invited the Chief, Mahomed bin Sanee, on board; he excused himself, but afterwards, at the request of Abdullah bin Subah, Chief of Koweit, he went on board, accompanied by his son. ' The Turkish Commander presented dresses of honour both to the Chief and his son, and said to the former, you asked for help, and we have been ordered to come here and help you, and will land the troops, ' The Chief replied, I did ask for help, but it was when I was at feud with Saud ; now we are friends, you had better go back again; this is no place for you ; there is no food for you or your thousand men. The officer said my orders are to land, and land I must, you had better write to my Government to say you don't want us, and I will then go when ordered. The force landed and took possession of a fort called ' El Maselim ' and a few houses near it. The people of El Biddeh are very angry at this occupation of the place. The larger Turkish ship had left, but the smaller was still at Biddeh.' 176. Regarding the brothers Abdullah and Saud, Colonel Felly wrote ' Abdullah bin Peysul continues to live at Riadh, while his brother Saud hangs on the desert skirts of Gwattur. The brothers are, I believe, in correspondence, but whether their prejudices and respective pretensions will admit of their practically coalescing remains to be seen. ' The Turkish forces are distributed as before reported. But they are probably further diminished by sickness, and by return of time-expired men. Katif seems to be so un healthy that one of the Turkish Commanders informed me it was in contemplation to abandon the present site of the town as a military station/' 177. On the 26th January Colonel Herbert telegraphed that 120 artillery men had left Baghdad on the previous day for Katif and several hundred invalids had arrived thence. • Bombay Gcer^nt, No. 1007, dated 19ft _ 17S - C 0 ' 0 ™ 3 ' Pell y a letter dated 27 th February 1872. J anuary Wrote* ' The reports I have received from many points extending from Busreh to the pirate coast bear a common resemblance, but are all of them more or less unreliable. ' I gather, generally, however, that the Turkish force at Lahsa has been reduced below its original strength; but that reinforcements are being sent to Katif in Snipe, which steamer the Turkish authorities have recently purchased. That Abdoollah bin Feysul is still at Riadh in communination with his brother Saood, who with a body of Bedouins is moving about on the inland skirts of Gwuttur. ' 5r^.—That Saood in turn is in communication with the Turkish Commander at Lahsa in view to a meeting at a place called ' Cheranabthe Principals seem to mistrust each other. —That the Turkish troops have been withdrawn from El Biddeh in Gwuttur, leaving there only a detachment for the protection of srores, &amp;c. It is also generally believed that the Arabs of Gwuttur are dissatisfied with Turkish proceedings.' [C967i , D] o50 Attitude of Bahrein Chief. Evidence of Turkish designs against Bahrein. 179. As already shown in paragraph 57, the Chief of Bahrein at the com- mencement of the Expedition expressed bis reliance on trucial engagement, and requested advice and protection from the British Government. On receipt of the assurances from the Turkish Government [vide paragraph 72] tbat no in tention was entertained of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, the Chief was in formed accordingly by Colonel Pelly on the 26th May, and told that the Turkish Expedition in no way affected the treaty rights and obligation of the British Government or trucial Chiefs. In subsequent letters the Chief was directed to observe strict neutrality, and that as long as he observed Articles II and III of the Treaty with the British Government, that Government would fulhl its obligations. The Chief in reply expressed himself determined not to act against these agreements in any way. 180 In accordance with the advice and instructions received by him the Chief had throughout carefully abstained from committing himself with either of the belligerent parties, and had always shown himself ready to accept and act on the advice of Colonel. Pelly, more especially in the matter of the murder of the Turkish messenger (paragraph 149) and the demand made on him by Midhut Pasha for the surrender of two boats (paragraph 153). When it was thought that Midhut Pasha was about to visit Bahrein, the Chief asked for instructions from Colonel Pelly as to his behaviour on the occasion. Colonel Pelly recommended him to be courteous to all guests of consequence, who visited his territories, but absolutely to abstain from mixing himself up in any quarrels that might be going on beyond his own frontiers. 181. In October 1871 a misunderstanding arose between the Chief and his brothers, which might have been incovenient at that juncture, had not an amicable settlement been arrived at. According to the Chief's account, he had hitherto assigned to his two brothers a third of the revenues of Bahrein, but, urging that this was not sufficient for them, they demanded one-half,' which the Chief eventually consented to give so that there might be no open ing for his enemies to intervene. 182. Abdul Aziz, a son of Saud, appears to have visited Bahrein in August, and to have been received with great ceremony by the Chief. Ihere is nothing to show what was his object in visiting the island, nor is any further mention made of him in the subsequent reports. 183. Notwithstanding the explicit assurances of the Ottoman Porte as regards Behrein indications had not been wanting of a desire on the part of the Baghdad local authorities to obtain some pretext for interfering in the affairs of the island. The tone of the Pasha's letters on the subject of the murder of the messenger and the demand for surrender of the two Katif boats (para graphs 147 and 150) needs no comment. 184. In a letter of the 29th December 1871,* Colonel Pelly reported the * Enclosure to Bombay Government No. 378, Substance of a Conversation between an rr-rT, „ . ^ t . c ^? f his acquaintance and Slidhut. Pasha, when the latter was at Katif. The Arab was a w T ealthv pearl merchant whose information had always proved accurate, and Colonel Pelly had no moral doubt that his conversation with the Pasha was brought direct from the lashas lips. According to the Arab's account, after conversation on other subjects, the Pasha asked him if he had ever heard of the Sultan of Eoom [Turkey], and said that he would very soon hear of him. ' The Pasha asked me/' proceeded the Arab, 'whether it were true that the Bahreinees had petitioned to be taken under British protection. I replied it was quite true, and that all claeses^ had long: been and still were most anxious for the protection o£ the Britibh flacr I3ut that it bad not been accorded to them. ' The Pasha then asked me if I thought I could procure the signatures of 50 or 60 sub- stantial Bahrein merchants and others to a petition begging for Turkish rule. I said perhans such a thing might be done, but I was doubtful. 1 ' The Pasha asked how long it would take me to try and collect the names. I said three or four days. He said very well, then I will delay my departure from Kateef for three days I told him that success in the matter would seem to be very doubtful. Hut thif T wmilri repoit to him at the end of three days.51 ' On the occasion of my second interview, however, the Pasha femarked that he must return at once to Bagdad, that the matter of the petition, therefore, had better be dropped, but that I might obtain something from my own relatives in regard to Turkish rule, and accordingly the Chief of Koweit^ who was in ths PaslWs suite, gave me a letter for one of my relatives opening communication and offering him advantages at Kateef.' The same Arab stated tliat he had been offered a Turish flag by the Commodore of the Ottoman fleet. 185. One of the papers found on the body of the messenger murdered at Bahrein was a letter from a son of Nasir bin Mobarik, the escaped pirate, in which the former says :— &lt;( The Turks are mindful of Gwuttur, Bahrein, and other places in view to putting down their enemies so that their friends may rejoice.' 186. This letter is alluded to by the Bahrein Chief in his letter to the Paslia (paragraph. 138 A). 186 A. Writing in November Colonel Pelly reported:— ' The general tone and tendency of the Turkish proceedings for some months past leave little doubt in my mind as to the intentions or at least wishes of His Excellency Midhut Pasha towards Bahrein.' 187. Eeferring to the departure of the Pasha from the Gulf, Colonel Pelly on th.e 21st December telegraphed ' The Government policy and holding our ships persistently before Bahrein in my opinion brought the Pasha and Turkish Squadron to abandon their intended interference, and our success is publicly felt in these regions to be a timely and necessary check to Turkish preten sions which were before misunderstood to our prejudice.^ Assarances of Turkey. 188. In February 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded papers received from Constantinople. Server Pasha Secret, May 1872, Nob . 62-88. desired M. Pisani to state that Her Majesty's Government might rest assured that tbe policy followed previously by the Porte towards the independent tribes along the Persian Gulf had under gone no alteration whatever, and His Excellency asserted again on the part of the Porte that no intention was ever entertained, nor any design harboured, to subdue those tribes or obtain any supremacy over them. Ttie sole object of the Nejd expedition he stated to have been, and still to be, to restore order and tranquility there, and establish a regular and cohesive administration more in conformity with the requirements of the country. Policy of Government. 189. In April 1872 the Bombay Government again wrote to say that they attached no importance to the assurances PtoceedingB, Secret, May 1872, No. 77. Turkish Government as reported in the papers received from Constantinople, as there w T as no intormation as to what tribes in the Persian Gulf would be considered by them to be independent, or what they considered to be the limits of the kingdom of Nejd. The Government of Bombay thought that some specific declaration as to what the claims were should be at once obtained. The Government of India replied that the assuran ces repeatedly given by the Turkish Government, to the effect that they had no intention of obtaining supremacy oyer Bahrein, Maskat, or the other indepen dent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, were accepted as satisfactory, and that it was not considered expedient or likely to lead to any good result to ask for a specific declaration of the claims of the Turkish Government. 190. The policy of Her Majesty's Government was laid down in the following despatch, dated 9th May 1*872, addressed to the Biitish Ambassador at Constantinople— «1 have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the Government of India respecting the proceedings of the Turkish authorities m the Persian Gulf, more especially with reference to the increase which the Porte has recently made in the number of vessels employed in those waters. Her Majesty 's Government, however, consider that as long at Turkey is engaged in- upholding its legitimate authority in the Gulf, they cannot ash it to curtail the means whte/i it considers necessary for doing so, but they may fairly say to the Porte that they trust and egpeot that no attempt will be made to extend that authority, which would raise questions between52 the Indian ^Government and the PorU, the mainlemnce of the existing state of things in the Gulf and on its hordert being considered a matter of great importance to the general iranf quillity of those quarters-, the presence of large Turkish armaments is generally calculated to disquiet the bordering countries, and must necessarily cause the British Govern* ment to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. 191. This despatch was duly communicated to Server Pasha in June 1872 and he repeated the assurance, already so often given, of the absence of all in tention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government might be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations. Abu-Thabi Chief. 192. Colonel Ross telegraphed as follows in July 'Frequent rumours reach Bahrein of intended move of a Turkish detachment from Nejd to Oman coast. It is said their design is to gain footing at Beyranee through con nivance of Chief of Abuthabi. I cannot rely on information as yet received, but have ins tructed Assistant Resident to use May Frere to ascertain facts. Knowing letters to have passed between Chief of Abuthabi and Turkish authorities, I think it possible he may have made overtures. Possibly Colonel Herbert could ascertain if any extension of Turkish influence eastward contemplated.' 193. In September 1872 the Abuthabi Chief declared his adherence fo Political a., November 1872, No.. «. ^urks He had previously been inclined towards the Turks, but on hearing of their proceedings in Katif, Katar, and Hasa he kept aloof and determined to make peace first with the Chief of Debai and then proceed to Maskat to renew friendly relations with Syud Turki. When at Maskat he reported to Colonel Boss (then Political Agent) that he had received a letter from some Turkish authority, couched in vague terms, which he had understood to be an invitation to recognize the Turkish Government as the paramount authority. 194. On the 20th September 1872* Turki himself informed Colonel Pelly • Politic*! A., January 1873, Nos. 865-268. ^ ^ Su ^ m ission of the Abuthabi Chief and the renewal of friendship, and that by gones would be bygones. Turkish Policy. 195. It thus appears that numerous assurances were given 'by the Turks that they intended no attack on Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and that, by the order of the Secretary of State, the Persian Gulf trucial Chiefs were interdicted from maritime operations, while Colonel Pelly was instructed to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. . 196. Satisfactory as these assurances were, it was soon found that the Turkish Government were bent upon to gain a footing in Bahrein by indirect means, by encouraging the enemies of the Chief of Bahrein in their intrigues against the island, and to extend their dominion in the Katar Peninsula They employed Nasir-bin-Mobarik, the leading member of the rival branch of the Bahrein Sheikh's family, for this purpose. The Turks also gained over to their side, Jasim, son of Mahomed-bin-Thani, Chief of Bidaa, and employed him as a useful weapon in their anti-British policy in regard to Bahrein and the Katar and pirate coasts. They tried to incite the tribes on the Katif and Katar coasts facing Bahrein to maintain a hostile attitude against Bahrein and even to make piratical attacks against the island, while they took few effective measures to suppress piracies of these tribes in the Katif waters. Close of the Turkish Expedition. 196-A. After unsuccessful efforts to induce Abdullah to return to the Turkish camp, Eauf Pasha, who had succeeded as Governor-General of Turkish Arabia opened communications with Saud in spring of 1872, but failed to persuade him to place himself in the power of the Turks. He, however, sent his brother Abdul Bahman accompanied by Fahad-ibn-Suaitan to Hasa to negotiate Abdul Bahman was induced to accompany Haji Ahmed Khan, who had been sent by the Pasha to treat, to Baghdad, where he was retained under surveil lance until August 1874.

A protest was, after the assembly had broken up, presented by some of the chief men of Hasa to Nasir Pashn, against the appointment of Bezech, as being unfit for the Government. These memorialists were imprisoned for their trouble and despatched to Baghdad. One Khezir Effendi was appointed Kaimakam of Katif. 200. During this visit of Nasir Pasha to Hasa, there were anchored at Eas Tanarah the following Turkish vessels (3) Lebanon. (4) Sinojoe. They were disembarking wheat and barley for Hasa and Katif and taking on board troops for Basrah. 201 One of the reasons which induced the Turkish Government to re- Administration Report, Peman Golt Re.idenc,, mOVe these troops Was, in the Opmion oi for 1874-75. the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, the unhealthiness of Hasa districts and the fact that the expense of keeping a large garrison of regular troops was found to be a serious drain on the treasuary. So a corps of irregular troops (or rather armed police) as placed under Bezech's orders. It was hoped that with this force at his disposal and the assistance of friendly Arab tribes, the new Governor would be able to preserve order and tranquillity. 202.

Early in the autumn the Pasha of Baghdad withdrew the restrictions imposed on Abdul Rahman's liberty and he was allowed to quit Turkish territory. Ihe young Chief proceeded to Bahrein and immediately entered into a secret cor respondence with the heads of several tribes on the mainland. Einding some * In addition to those mentioned above, A 7 ajiz t'uska (paragraph 173-A), Mahomed Pasha (paragraph 196-A and Faiz Pasha (paragraph 196-C), [C967PD] N54 of them ready to espouse his cause, he resolved with the rash impetuosity of youth to organise an expedition for the deliverance of Hasa from the Turkish yoke. What his ulterior projects were never became knowa, but it is probable that, if success had attended his arms, he would have joined his brother Saud. Quitting his temporary home in Bahrein, where he stayed but a few weeks, he went to Ojair and was there joined by many of his allies, while others flocked to his banner as he advanced. In Hasa he met with an enthusiastic reception, and the whole province declared in his favour. Saeing resistance hopeless, Bezech shut himself up in the fort at Hofhuf, where he stood a long siege and managed to defy all efforts to dislodge him. Prompt measures were mean while taken by the Turks to quell the revolt and vindicate their authority. A force of three regiments of infantry, each about 800 strong, with four guns and a few irregulars, were despatched in two vessels of war, and a transport to the sea-port of Katif under the command of Nasir Pasha. The work of retribu tion was quick, decisive, and terrible. Lance, sword, and matchlock were of little avail against Turkish guns and discipline. The play of the enemy's ar tillery soon worked confusion among the motley masses of the Arabs. Abdul Rahman was the first to flee and his example was quickly followed by his army which dispersed in all directions. This was all the resistance that the Turks met with, no further attempt being made by Abdul Rahman to rally his scat tered forces or harass his foes. Then followed the sack of Hasa and the slaugh ter and outrage of many of the inhabitants, females even being submitted to the last degradation. This lasted for some days and then quarter was granted. Hasa laid waste, half its people fled, and the revolt extinguished, the Turkish forces began their homeward march towards Katif, whence they embarked and landed in Baghdad by February. 202A. On the restoration of order, Nasir Pasha withdrew with the Turkish Formation of new province. forces to Basiah, and shortly afterwards he was appointed G overnor of a new Turk ish province formed on the littoral, consisting of Basrah and its dependencies including Nejd. The establishment of this province, and more especially the appointment of Nasir Pasha, caused grave apprehension amongst the Trucial Chiefs of the coast, who addressed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject. 203. Previous to leaving Hasa Nasir Pasha had removed Bezech from his Paiz Pasha, 1875-76. post and made his own son Faiz Paiha Said Bey 1st time^ 1876.77. Governor of Hasa, of whose administration we know nothing. He was succeeded by Said Bey on 1876. Said Bey was one of the latest Governors Hasa had, but must be distinguished from another capable Governor Said Pasha, his successor. 201 Said PasAa—was nominated Governor of Hasa in 1S81. He earned Said Pasha, 1st time (1877-79.) the good will of the inhabitants and a 79*8o!^ adiniai,cration Rep0ltB for 1878 - 79 and reputation as a good administrator. He ' ' . .

The fort was sacked and eventually the Amev? sub- mitted to Said Pasha and gave hostages for future good behaviour. The Beni Hajir however defied his authority and a respectable merchant of Hasa was waylaid and murdered by Zaid-bin-Mahomed. 205.

The Governor, however did not think fib to give the written order, so the troops did not proceed to execute the verbal direction.

Bahrein written about the same time :— Translation of news-report from Residency Agent, Bahrein, No. 14, dated 24th January 1882. After compliments.—It is said by those who come from Katif and El-Hasa that the present Pasha in El-Hasa is most energetic in collecting money in every possible manner either in pretence of arrears of revenue or by bribes or other methods, and sends it to Irak Amon'g others they say that he has harshly imprisoned the Financial Secretary in El Ha«a* and taken a large sum from him, and then incited a lot of people to make complaints against him and to bring the complants to him (Pasha). There is said to be an old standino- orud^e between these two. They also say that a few days ago in Katif the Kaim Makam seized Ahmed-bin-Mehdi andconfined him for some days in the Siraza (Government House) and took from him the arrears of revenue due frr the time he had been Governor of Katif No matter how be protested that he had not collected tlF-se arrears, his excuses we're not listened to. Two days ago I also heard that the Kaim Makam assembled an ijlas in Kateef at which the merchants of the town were present, and questioned them about the arrears'of revenue due by the heads of villages in the Katif district. They replied that these arrears had nothing to say to them. The Kaim Makam said that they must either produce before him those who owed these arrears, or else pay them up themselves. They asked why they should have to pay. He replied because they were instrumental in their escape. He then got into a ffreat rage and started with 60 soldiers and one gun for a village near Katif to frighten the &amp; in habitants. He found no one in the village and returned. He then ordered the ship to be got ready and the boats to be lowered to cruize around Katif and prevent anyone from escaping by boat. He then published a notice that no one could leave Katif by sea unless provided with a passport, for which Rs. 3 would be charged.

After compliments. —With reference to my No. 14, dated 5th Rabi-al-Awal 1299=25th January 1882, I beg to state that I hear that two days ago some people from the villages of Katif fled from that place and came to Bahrein in their fishing-boats, and that others will also come, and it is probable the Pasha of Hasa or the Kaim Makam of Katif will demand them from the Chiefs of Bahrain. Up to date, however, nothing has been heard from them regarding this matter.66 l near further that some of them, the fugitives, -will go to Busrah and Baghdad for mak ing a complaint. The Turkish vessel Arcadia, which was at Katif, is reported to have gone to Busrah. Translation of news-report from Residency Agent, Bahreiny to Lieutenant-Colonel e. C. Ross? Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, No* 23, dated 26th Bahi-al-Awal 1299= 15th February 1S82. After compliments. —With reference to my letter No. 17 of 10th Rabi-al-Awal 1299=30th January 188^, regarding fugitives from Katif, I bear from their elders that the balance of revenue on account of date plantation now demanded from them by the Turks, is nearly Rs. 1 ,70^000 ; this money is required from all the inhabitants of the villages of Katif and is due on account of date plantations belonging to Turkish Government situated in the villages within the limits of Katif. The circumstances are as follow :—The Kaim Makam of Katif oroers the headman of the village to look after and water the Government trees, and the latter orders another to do this work gratis, and gratis work brings on ruin to the trees year after year; from ten trees there has remained one, and the trees are registered in the books according to their former produce, viz., ten years ago. 'When the time for estimating the prednce arrives, the estimator comes and estimates ; if the produce be 1,000 killas dates, he estimates at 2,500 ; at the time of giving them (the fugitives) the Government produce, if the killa be worth a rupee in bazaar, they charge them 3 krans year after year, and the balance has been accumulating from the time they took Katif till now. As regards private date trees, as the owners bribe the estimators, matters are made easy for them, and no balance remains to be paid by them on account of tax. I hear the Mutessariff of El-Hasa, Said Pasha, has written them a letter in reply to their complaint against the Kaim Makam ; it reached them a couple of days ago, and I hear it is a rigid one. A part of it says that the Kaim Makam acted according to his (Mutes- sarifTsj order in recovering the balance due to Government, and their departure to Bahrein would not profit them ; it would cause the ruin of Government property ; if thpy had been suffering from injustice, their corr,plaints would have been listened to by the Government and so forth. At present some of the aforesaid fugitives are in hesitation ; some wish to go to Bxisrah and Baghdad to complain ; some fear the Mutass iriff might cause enmity ; whilst some say it would better to go to El-Hasa and address the Mutassariff verbally.

Dissensions had, during the past Gulf Administration Report for 1.86-87. few yearS) bpen ri f e amongst ^ Ambs residing under the jurisdiction of Sheikh Jasim of Bidaa, and bodies of seceders first settled at loweyrat on the Katar Coast, where they were to some extent under the protection of the Nairn tribe, who maintained intimate friendly rela tions with the Chief of Bahrein. 212. In the year 1885 a body of the Wakra Arabs consisting of about 100 men of the tribe Al-bu-Ainain and Al-Jehran, owing to disputes with their own chief and with Sheikh Jasim, left Wakra and settled at a place named Ghareyah in Katar. A coalition had thus been formed to resist Sheikh Jasim, and during the past year Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab, having quarrelled with Jasim, identified himself with the opposing faction. A conference took place between Jasim and Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab in presence of the commander of a Turkish gun-boat at Bidaa, when the Turkish officer suggested that Jasim should let the people of Ghareyah remain in peace under Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wabab. Sheikh Jasim was much annoyed at the proposal and incited his adherents to attack Ghareyah, but they were beaten off with the loss of a few men of the Beni Hajir. Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab entered on a course of intrigue with the Turkish officials of Hasa, apparently with the object of ousting Sheikh Jasim and obtaining for himself the post of Kaim Makam of Katar under the Turkish Government. He was said to have advised the institution of a Turkish custom house at Bidaa, a measure whicn seemed to have been favourably considered by the Turkish officials, whilst the inhabitants warmly protested against it.57 213. Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab, who had transFerred his residence from Bidaa to Ghareyah, proceeded on a visit to Hasa, whence he returned in May, via Ojair, accompanied by a body of about 50 Turkish gendarmes, of whom 20 were said to be for the protection of Ghareyah and the rest for the relief of the garrison of Bidaa. It was reported that the Mutassaritf of Hasa had pro claimed Ghareyah to be Turkish territory. Subsequently the commander of the Turkish gun-boat Zohaff landed at Ghareyah, and made notes of the leading inhabitants, etc. 214. Sheikh Jasim greatly resented the position assumed by Mahomed- bin-Abdul Wahab, with the aid and support of the Turks, of Governor of Ghareyah, and threatened to withdraw from Bidaa with his adherents and to commence hostilities against Mahomed-bin-Abdul 'VYahab. 215. In July it was reported that Mahomed-bia-Abdul Wahab had visited Sheikh Jasim at Bidaa, and that terms of reconciliation were arranged between them with the cognisance of the Turkish commander. The Turkish corvette Zohaff fired a salute of ^1 guns in honour of the occassion, but the terms agreed on were kept secret. 216. Several robberies took place on boats of Bahrein in the waters of Katif, the Turkish officials showing their usual apathy and indifference. Re ports of these incidents were forwarded, as usual, to the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. 217. Mahomed -bin-Abdul Wahab, who had continued to keep up an active correspondence with the Turkish officials of Haaa and Turkish Arabia, visited Bahrein in winter. He was there met by the Jehrain from Ghareyah, about '250 in number, and it was arranged that these people should settle at Darin in the Katif District, where Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab would join them later and bscome their leader. He obtained permission of the Governor of Hasa for this settlement. Probably, indeed, it had been pre-concerted for some time By this migration Ghareyah had become nearly depopulated, whilst Darin appeared on the fair way to becoming a village of some importance. 218. Saleh Pasha was succeeded by Bifat Pasha (1887-89). Pasha in 1877. 219. In January 1889 Kifat Beg, Mutassarif of Hasa was dismissed from service. There had been for some time External a., February 1889, Nos. 384 335- . much unpleasantness between him and the military commandant, partly owing to some disagreement in connection with the estate of the deceased Ahmed-bin Mahomed; which the civil authori ties wished to take possession of, while the military opposed this intention. It- was even rumoured that the Mutassarif was assaulted and ill-treated by the Commandant, but this rumour was apparently unfounded. 220. The successor of Eifat Beg was AUf Fasha. He dismissed the Akif Pasha, (i889 -oi). Kaimakam of Katif, and proceeded to External a., September 1889, Nos. 250-251. investigate into the recent robberies and piracies. He entertain some grand schemes for extending the influence of the Turkish Government in Katif and Katar One of his proposals was to lay a telegraphic line between Bariah and Katif, and make the people of Hasa and Katif to pay the cost of tbe undertaking. He also proposed to establish custom houses at Darin and Katar. This project was at first abandoned, as it was apprehended that in carrying it out, they would only drive the Bedouins from the country to the interior or to Bahrein. 221. Akif Pasha advocated the organization of a dromedory mounted police to replace the existing mounted police, a 8 .! J»^iarJ C i89i, Nos. 93-94. with which force it was found impos sible to cope with the recalcitrant Bedouins and the work of escorting caravans from Hasa to Ojair. The scheme was to establish several mili- tarv posts in the town along the coast for the preservation of order. The Turkish Government sanctioned the establishment of seventeen posts. [C967rD] Q58 It was also decided at the recommendation of Akif Pasha to rebuild Zebarah and Odeid (See the Katar Frecis). Garrisons External A. August 1888, No.. 411-446. were also stationed at Has Tanarah and Bidaa in 1889, which numbered 400 men, their ostensible object being to carry out the wishes of Her Majesty's Governnient for the effective suppression of piracy on the west coast of the Persian Gulf. 222. Said Tasha succeeded Akif Pasha SBid Pasha 3rd time 1891-94. as Mutassarif of Hasa and arrived at Hasa External June 1891, Noa. 366-369. . , . _ in May 1891. His policy was to embrace the conciliation of the Bedouins, the restora tion of their subsidies forfeited by his predecessor, and the removal of grievances previously allowed to pass unchecked. Arrangements were made in 1891 whereby the caravan route between Hasa and Ojair had become safe, and tra vellers free from molestation by Bedouins. 223. In March 1892 it was reported that the Kaim Makam of Katif, had ^ received instructions to appoint officials Administration Eeport for 1892-93. . . i at Katit, Ojair and Katar, to levy port- dues. This report proved to be correct as regards Katif at least, for in Decem ber the Chief of Bahrein represented that port-dues were being levied there on Baherin boats. Enquiry, however showed that this tax was levied on all boats entering Katif harbour and not on those of Bahrein alone. The Beni Hajir pirates carried on their depredations at Katif itself and close to it, of which an account appears elsewhere. 224. About the middle of October 1892 the Vali of Basrah accompanied by two of Turkish gun-boats and a regiment of infantry, arrived at Katif, en route for Hasa. The troops were disembarked and sent in boats to Ojair to march with His Excellency to Hasha. 225. The Vali, soon after his arrival, was stated to have arrested the Kaim Makam for some unknown reason, and he was afterwards taken as a prisoner to Hasa. His successor appears to have inaugurated a more effective policy, for proclamations were issued by him at Katif, noubtless by the autho rity of the Vali, declaring Bahrein and Oman to be within Turkish jurisdiction, and Turkish flags were offered to the nacodas of Bahrein boats, who, however, refused to accept them. Under these circumstances there was at first suspi cion that the troops with the Wali might be used against Bahrein. The Porte, how r ever, disclaimed any intention of so employing them. 226. In May 1892 it was reported that a caravan proceeding from Hasa to Ojair under an escort of twenty-five Turkish soldiers was attacked on the 14th idem by some three hundred Bedouins of the Monasir, Beni Hajir, and Morrah tribe, who were reported to have killed fifteen and wounded ten persons; car ried off booty estimated at Rs. 50,000 in cash, and Rs. 20,000 in goods, and plundered some forty pilgrims with the caravan. 227.^ They were said to have sent the booty to Katar, their place of refuge, with Jasim-bin-Thani, for sale there. Various robberries in the neighbourhood' of Hasa were attributed to the Beni Hajir and Morrah, and the townspeople were said to travel in bands of a score or so of armed men under the escort of a Bedouin whose presence insured their safety from the tribesmen. 22S. The first action of the Vali on arrival at Hasa appears to have been to take security from the principal people of the town and neighbourhood, as he had done at Katif, to have no dealing with the Beni Hajir, Morra, and Mona sir, who thereupon retreated into the desert. 229. A number of the Arabs of Hasa were appointed to convey caravans between it and Ojair, thus leaving the Wali free to employ the whole of his force against the Bedouins. The troops appear to have made one or two raids against the tribe, and carried off a number of cattle and camels, but no sennni encounter took place. 230. In February 1893 the Wali marched from Hasa taking with him the regiment of infantry which accompanied him from Basrah, and ^three hundred59 ravalry who had marched vid Koweit. The two gun-boats were ordered to meet him at Bidaa. 231. In consequence of the reports in June 1893 of a^ar^e tribal gathering of the Beni-Hajar, Morrah, and Manasir, to attack the Beni-Khalid, it was found necessary of provide a guard of Turkish troops to escort the Hasa caravan for Ojair. The projected raid collapsed, the tribesmen returning with little booty. 282. In February 1894 the Bedouins of the Dowasir tribe raided a caravan on the road between Hasa and Katif, and carried off some goods; on learning however, that the caravan was escorted by a man of their tribe, the robbers made restitution. 233. Cholera broke out at Katif and lasted for over a month in July and August 1893. At the commencement of the outbreak, the death rate was 10 to 15 daily ; it subsequently rose to 50 or 60 daily. 234. The Wali of Basrah visited Katif on his way back to his head-quar' ters from Bidaa in May J 893. 235. The people of the place having petitioned against the Kaim-Makam and complained against his malpractices, he was removed from his post in July 1893. The new Governor, Baouf Effendi, did not, however, assume charge of the duties of his post till January 1894. 236. In January 1894 the Turkish gun-boat Mujdeh-Besan arrived at Katif with 90 military reliefs ; 30 of these were landed at Katif for Ojair, and the remainder were conveyed to Katar. 237. In April 1894 Said Pasha, the Mutasarrif of Hasa resigned, and Ibrahim Fasha, formerly of Hodeida, was Ibrahim Pasha (IP94-96.) appointed in his place. A struggle w 7 as Gulf administration Keport for 1894-9 . maintained almost throughout the year between the people and the authorities, in regard to the enhanced assessment of the date produce for export, caused by the fall in silver value, the injustice of the mode of assessment, and the exactions of the customs master. Two or three deputations proceeded to Basrah to appeal to the Wali in the matter, but though a commission was appointed to arrange the matter, the grievances remained unredressed. 238. An appeal to the Supreme Government proving also unavailing, the merchants and others began to seek refuge at Bahrein and in January 1895, the number of these refugees amounted to about 130, and a further exodus was reported in February. A demand for arrears of the duty for the two previous years, added to the general discontent, which was still further aggra vated by the high-handed exaction by the Turkish soldiery, of krans at the exchange rates of 5J for the dollar. 239. Finally, in March 1895, the Governor of Hasa, while still refusing the concessions asked for, having, upon the instructions from Basrah, pro mised a better arrangement for the ensuing year, and having also dismissed the tax collector, who had made himself obnoxious to the people of Katif, those who had taken refuge at Bahrein were induced to return. 240. The Governor of Hasa with the object of gaining credit with his Goverment, undertook an expedition for Gulf Administration Report for 1895-96. ^ purpose of establishing a more effec tive and profitable Turkish control over the Ajman, Morrah and other tribes, who had hitherto paid only a nominal tax. The Ajman while admitting his demands pleaded their inability to pay without recovery of their property pil laged by the Moteyr and seized by Mahomed Ibn Bashid. The Governor accordingly attacked the Moteyr with the help of Ajman and other tribes, cap turing some of their animals. He was then summoned to Basrah, and^ after his return was active in encouraging the hostile attitude taken by Sheikh Jasim bin Mahomed Thani in support of the A1 bin Ali resistence to the Bahrein Chief which is noticed in the Katar Frecis.60 241. The Beni Hajir pursued their habitual course of robbery. In July 1896 a band of this tribe made a descent Gulf Administration Report for 1896-97. u^On the flocks of ^ NaitU tribe in Katar carried off no less than 3,000 sheep, as was reported, besides a number of camels. The same rubbers having committed further depredations, Mahomed Ihn Rashid, the powerful ruler of Nejd, sent to Sheikh Jasim iu November to demand restitution of the property plundered his subjects. This demand was promptly complied with, and a threat from Sheikh Jasim of a general attack upon the Beni Hajir, failing their restoration of the plunder, had the desired effect. 242.

The following report of Mr. Gaskin, dated 11th January 1901, will be read with interest as throwing light on Turkish methods of administration and policy :— ' I have the honour to report that Said Pasha has been dismissed from his post of Mute- Secret E., March 1901, Nos. 74-75. sarrif of Hasa and he arrived here on the 1st Jan uary 1901, too late to proceed by the Royal Mail Steamer which left Bahrein on the same day for Basrah. I paid His Excellency a friendly visit on the 6th Januiry 1901, and throughout my visit he was very communicative and disposed to be very friendly, and that was due, I think, to his being a native of Baghdad and not of a Turkish origin. From his conversation I gathered that he has held the post of Mutesarrif of Hasa on three occasions and has served his Govern ment in a similar capicity in every province in Turkish Arabia. He attributes his dismissal to the intrigues carried on against him by the Commandant of the Turkish forces in Hasa, whom he describes as being an ignorant Turk with no sympathy for the local people, and con- sequently he could not get on with him. The commandant, it appears, had reported to the Turkish Commander-in-Chief at Paghdad to the effect that in consequence of Said Pasha takiD^ no measures to put a stop to the importation of arms into the territory under his charge all the tribesmen have become possessed of arms equal to those with which the Turkish garrison is armed, and the Imperial forces will meet with formidable opposition in the event of their haying to take the field against any truculent Chiefs. This report was forwarded on to Constantinople and was the principal means of bringing about Said Pasha's downfall. . His Excellency returned my visit on the 8th January. He referred to the past friendship and support extended to Turkey by Her Majesty's Government and much deprecated the growing estrangement of the two Powers. I mentioned to him the report of the alleged con cession for pearl-divmg in the Persian Gulf given by Turkey to Germanv. He v?as much surprised at the report and declared that about 9 years ago some foreigner's applied to the Porte for a similar concession and it was refused. He expressed an opinion that such a conces- sion was worthless, as Turkey had no exclusive right to any particular pearl banks and the Arabs are sure to oppose any operations carried out with scientitic appliances. With reference to the Turkish garrisons in Hasa and Katar, Said Pasha informed me that he considered the employment of soldiers of the regular army in a country where so manv physical difhculties exist is a mistake, and he has suggested to his Government that the garri sons should be reduced and a larger number of Arab camelry from among the local tribes he engaged to replace them. He thinks that the substitution of a portion of the reoular troons by camelry will effect a large saving and at the same time they will have a mobile force which will enable them to keep the Arabs in better check/' 246. The District of Hasa was as usual, in a marked state of disorder in Gulf Admimstration Report for 1902-03. 1902-03. The caravan route between Ojair and Hasa was unsafe for the greater part ot the year and three large caravans were attacked and plundered bv Arabs. One ot the three caravans, which left Hasa for Ojair on the 29th Anril 1902. was escorted by 120 cavalry, 80 mounted irregulars and 30 infantry and• 61 was attacked by a part of tlie Morra, Safran and Beni Hajir Arabs. It was said tbat nearly ail the escort was killed and the few who escaped were held as hostages for the safety of tbe Arab tribesmen who were in Turkish custody at Hasa. 247. The new Governor's administration was much what was expected Secret e, August 1903, No. 274. ? rom bis ^famous reputation. The follow ing instance of his oppression reported by Colonel Wratislaw (10th March 1903) was typical of his ways:—- &lt;c The following recent instance of almost incredible disregard for appearances in satisfying* his rapacious instincts has raised the greatest indignation amongst the Arab population, not only in the Hasa Sandjak, but in Basrah, and even as far as Bagdad. One of tbe prin cipal merchants of Katif is Mansur Pasha, the local representative of the Civil List. He is very rich, and Thalib Pasha soon saw in him a suitable subject for blackmail. Mansur, however, declined to accede to tbe Mutesarrif's^ exertion, and fled to Basrah, and thence to Baghdad! boon after, at the end of January Thalib Pasha made a descent on Mansur's house, and imprisoned his brother, Abdul Hussam, carrying off property, including pearls, .in which Mansur trades, to a very considerable amount. Mr. Gaskin, the British Agent in Bahrein, reports that on the 7tb February three dhows loaded with loot arrived there in charge of Mahomed Attik, the Mutesarnf s confidential man, and I learn that these vessels subsecjuently came into the Shat-el-Arab and discharged their cargo at Seblieh, the Nakib's river-side residence about 15 miles from Basrah. To excuse his conduct, Thalib has forwarded to the Wali a bundle of 'seditious news papers' which, he asserted, had been found in Mansurs house, and also reported that a consi derable number of rifles had been seized at the same time. This latter statement is very likely correct, for all Arabs, particularly those who have valu ables, possess arms, and the circumstance has not the imporlance which might attach to it in other parts of Turkey. With regard to the newspapers, a strange light is thrown on the accusation by Mr. Gaskin's report, that on the 9th January Mahomed-bin Attik called on him and stated that Thakib Pasha was anxious to see some copies of Arabic newspapers from Egypt, Constantinople, London, and Paris, and made special mention of the Khalifa which is published in London and asked for some cop '.es. He was told that the British Agency did not receive any, but the inference obviously is that he was sent to collect such newspapers for subsequent discovery at Mansur's house Meanwhile, Mansur Pasha at Baghdad had interested the Mushir, who is also acting Walij in his behalf, l^he Mushir communicated with the Wali and with Constantinople, and the Wali has telegraphed to the Minister of the of Interior requesting that a Special Commis sioner be sent to inquire, but has received no answer. He is much depressed at the idea of having to hold an inquiry himself, as this will, he considers, mean that he is to whitewash Thalib, and so disgrace himself. He told me he would rather resign; he believes the news papers were placed in the house by Thalib''s orders, and expreses his astonishment that the British do not interfere on behalf of Mansur, as the latter traded with British Indian pearl merchants, to whom many of the pearls seized by the Mutesarraif belonged. This is, I believe, the case, but 1 have as yet received no complaints from British subjects. Mansur Pasha is a Shiab, which will tell in Thalib's favour at Constantinople but is likely to embitter local feeling at Katif, where the Shiahs are numerous and influential.'

Colonel Herbart, Political Resi dent, Baghdad, was therefore asked to ascertain from the Pasha whether there were any objections to the proposed survey. The reply was that our Ambassa dor at Constantinople telegraphed to the effect that the Porte authorized the survey. The Pasha wished, however, that a Turkish corvette should accompany H M's Schooner. Colonel Ross did not think this necessary, but the Govern ment directed (letter 24th March 1873) that the survey might proceed with or without a Turkish Corvette, and that if a Corvette wished to accompany the survey boat, no objection should be taken. 249. While the survey boat was proceeding to make the survey Colonel Ross instructed its Commander to comuni- Pohticai a ., May 18/3, Noi. ^ the Turkish local authorities at Katif the nature of his operations before landing to survey, and if any objection should be raised, to inform them that the operations were being un dertaken with the cognizance of the Porte. The Government of India approv ed of these instructions (Letter No. 986-P., dated 16th May 1873). 250. A complaint was then made by the Porte that the Survey Officers had landed on the Neid coast. 'When enqui- Pohtical A., August 1873, Nos. 104-112. . i , nes w T ere made. Colonel Ross reported that neither the surveying vessel nor any of her boats had come within 5 miles of the JS T ejd coast, that the survey had till then been confined to channels of approach to Bahrein, and that no attempt had yet been made to survey the coast of Katif or Nejd (Telegram of 31st July 1873). 251.

This request, the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, was desired to move the Ottoman Government to grant (Letter No. 2265-P., dated 23rd September 1873). 252.

Thereafter the Schooner Constance appears to have made the survey Political a ., April 1874, Nos. 195-196. '^' a ^ coas ^ uno bstructed. In March 3874 its commander reported that he was there surveying the coast to the north and westward of the Turkish district. In consequence of bad weather he had twice to put in for shelter under Ras Tanurah on the Katif coast, but apparently no protest was raised against his movements by the Turks.t 63 CHAPTER SIXTH. Increase of Turkish Military and Naval Forces in the Persian Gulf and Turkish Policy. We have in our records of this time a memorandum of 29th November 1871 written by Captain T. Doughty on Secret, July 1872, Noa. 120—122. the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf, and addressed to Rear Admiral H. Cockburn, which, would bear being quoted here; indicating as it does the forces in operation in connection with the Persian Gulf politics':— 'I have the honour to acknowledge your memorandum of October 25th, together with your private note of same date received by mail o£ yesterday^ and thank you much for the pleasant commendation you have been pleased to express in regard to my movements and proceedings. I had much pleasure also in conveying to Dr. Mulvancy your ' approval and thanks for the ability and zeal he displayed in the discharge of his duties. You desire of me more details about the politics of the Gulf. While wishing to comply with your request, 1 feel and know that I have nothing to offer beyond my own views and deductions from the events taken place around me, therefore hesitate to commit myself in an official despatch. My entire ignorance of the surrounding languages and natives, even of their very history beyond wha^ little of late I have been able to gather from the few books within my reach on the subject necessitates my requesting that whatever I may say on the subject of ' Gulf politics' may be regarded only as they appear to me, and not officially trust worthy, but rather Gossip founded on current reports and rumours. The Suez Canal, as you observe, ' has its shady side ' and for the pre-eminence we have h»ld in the Gulf since the decline of the Portuguese power a very shady side. For most of nations of Europe, ' Persia, and Arabia ' could have little interest, but for Kussia on one siie^of this Gulf and Turkey on the other there appears much attraction. The 1st Napoleon thought it worth his while to send an embassy to the Shah of Persia in the hope of outbidding us m the Shah 3 graces and o-et him to make a diversion on onr Indian border, when Napoleon invaded ugypt. In latter yews the Russians have been steadily at work along the northern border of Persia and Independent Tartary, till the Caspian may now be regarded as a Russian lake, their joad is still eastward and southward, and their influence is said to be felt in Afghanistan^ Wesfc- ward they have made a prodigious stride, and gained a point which thousands of our country men gave their lives to maintain in 1854-55. These things are porteritious. Arabia is the birth-place of El-Islam, and when driven from Europe, what country, in spite of its sterlity, could give the Turks so much influence or power of working on the sympathies^of the Moslems of all shades whether Sonnee, Shyia, or fanatic Wahabees as holding ' Rial (or Kiaz) the stronghold of the latter, and Mecca and Medina, and sa red centres of all other Moslem sects. Asiatic Turkey the Turks have, their dominion extending to the head of this Gulf with the great commercial towns of Bagdad and El Bashra. Till the Suez Canal became a working fact, the conquest of Arabia could have been, but a dream, the great desert tracts, the want of water, the distance from supplies, and the hostility of the tribes to all invaders, must have proved insurmountable difficulties, as they have always been, in all attempts at Arabian con quest. The Egyptians managed it for a time through clever working of the element of disunion among the independent tribes in their second attempt under Ibrahim rasia 1 2 , \ - ) Ibrahim being a Viceroy of the Turk Sultan, consequently, the conquest of Arabia made Arabia or rather Nejd (the Wahabee territory in the centre), which was the object ot t &gt;e invasion, a fief of the Porte. The succession of monarchs in Nejd since that time would seem to be ' Abd'alla'' captured by Egyptians and beheaded at Constantinople ; Turkee, his son, who was in exile during he Egypuan occupation, recalled by the Nejedeans when in rebellion for ^e expulsion of the Egyptians ; he was assassinated in 1834 by a Persian, and was succeeded by the late great Wahabee Chieftain, Fasul, who died some two or three years ago; the Wo sons ot * asu • Abd'alla and Saood, are the two Chieftains now in arms and fighting for the rule. ' Abd'alla bin Fasul is the elder, but primogeniture has never been the law, so there is Utt e in that argument as a matter of justice, but it affords an opening for Turk interference. 1 great difficulty of sending ships and supplies through the length of the Mediterraneanan so down the west coast of Africa round the Cape to the Red Sea and P ersian f got over by the Alexandria rail to Suez, vyhich enabled supplies to be sent for 8 ^?™ ent Suez in foreign bottoms and native craft) is now entirely got ovei by jus s earn g \ 4*Constantinople through the Canal to any port they like in the Red Sea with troops on boarrl, or march troops across to Bagdad and ships via C anal can, and have met them at ' f Ei Basra with supplies ready to convey them, as in the present instance, to Katif, or for the invasion of any part the sea-board of Arabia. The Russians are generally supposed to be desirous of having Constantinople, Possibly the Turks may be awaM, and our late policy wi;h poL7onKmk ,, _ l a'c. opi ° io ° ot tl&gt;c ''° ppMed r '' gar&lt;110 the Treat y o£ 1855 ma y m . ake them s,i11 more assured that we and probably Western Europe will not be disposed again to fight in their defence, and that, under these circumstances it is their duty to seek out among more friendly creeds a counterbalance in some sort for the lo?s she might singlehanded susrain against Russia. This view of the case seems strengthened by the fact that of late 'Turkey has much strengthened herself at Hodeidah and other ports in the Red Sea, assemblinar large bodies of troops, under the never-failing excuse of' keeping rebellious Arabs in subjection, the same policy seetrs tj have bepn going on at Bagdad. Till at last off starts an army fu'ly equipped from the shores of the Euphrates in Turk' transports accompanied by much Native craft, a squadron leaves Constantinople and appears unexpectedly in the Gulf supporting them, and I believe more troops have been sent to the Red Sea. Ostensibly the Sultan of Turkey, the 'Padishah/'' the father of his people,' regrets to see children in Arabia destroying themselves in interminable feuds, and that as the ' Nejedeans' in particular did not do him the honour of consulting him, as he holds they should have done about the succession to the Chieftainship, he proceeds to quiet the country, establish law and peaoe and to put Abdullah on the throne of his father. The Turk squadron in the mean time having landed the troops, employs its spare time in paying visits to the various parts on the coast, saluting their Sheikhs and disposing of small Turk ensigns for the country craft to disp'ay, explaining them the great advantages that may accrue to them in being under the protection of so great a Power, that a day may come when this ready acknowledgment may be remembered to their advantage, and that, for the present, the Turk flag will render them quite independent of any other interfering nations thero may in the Gulf waters, etc. Russia, meanwhile, we will suppose, looks on with a complacent eye; it assists to divert attention from herself, while she possibly may make some bargain with Persia for a port upon the northern sea board of the Gulf. (Bunder Abbass would suit her well, it was for over a century held by the Seyyeds of Oman, then by the Dutch, Portuguese, and ourselves for a short time, so that parting wiih that port and district to a Persian mind would not be felt like the giving away of territory they have always held. ' It is conveniently situated with res pect to the Indian Ocean, with plenty of good anchorage between it and Hormuz, which island might again be made a stronghold and emporium as renowned as in times past). Besides con quests by Turkey out here might be calculated to gradually reconcile the Turkish mind to a mio-ration across the Hellespont; the day is half won when your opponents begin to see matters in the same light as yourself. Russia has ports in the north of the China Sea and undoubtedly would like a port somewhere in these latitudes to rendezvous her ships in : now that they can pass from Sebas- topol down the coast of Syrii to the Canal, and so on out to India to our possessions, towards winch there seems much reason for supposing her cupidity tends. I cannot help thinkino- that the oultan and Czar understand each other remarkably well, and that the Turks have been lelt on to sending a squadron of ships into these waters as a feeler just to see how far we shall take notice, or object to this invasion of a sea in which for many years we have held undisputed sway. The Trucial Chiefs are some seven or eight Sheikhs of sea board towns with whom • we have made Treaties since the reduction of the pirate stronghold of Ras -el-Kheimah in 1819 that there shall be no more fighting at sea between them, no sending to sea of armed vessels, no interfering by one Chief with the pearl boats of another, and on our part we guarantee to protect them from molestation by sea from any other Arab tribe and to defend them by sea from invasion. It appears that Sheikh Mahomed bin Thoweynee of Bidda and I believe some others of still less power and importance (not Trucial Chiefs) have lately been persuaded to hoist the 1 urk flag : these Sheikhs, when asked why they do so, say, ' truly you may be Sultan of the sea, but who will deiend us by land this is doubtless a pithy reply, but it is &lt;f o-all ' to men like Colonel Pelly having their close fitting arrangements thus interfered with—men who have seen the day when withtheir squadron of Bombay ships their word was law depos- ing this c hief and setting up that. Such is much the case with Bahrein. The present Sheikh Esa,u bin Khuleefah a son of the late Sheikh, who was murdered a few years since Colonel . elly established (I believe fairly enough) in spite of opposition, and has maintained him in his authority, cutting oil all opponents. The Turks much want Bahrein; it is the only well- watered and fruitful place along the whole Arab coast of the Gulf, and there is no doubt thev will neglect no opportunity of coercing Sheikh Esau, or pretext for occupying the place. Consequently, Colonel Peily watches jealously this point, and hopes to meet Midhut Pasha65 i™Ii'ITr' r i e r ra V ,fa ' &lt;i ', ,f t ' le 0tto man possessions hereabouts), of whom it is e iJ that he intends calling in there and using his influence in spite of th« urotestaton Kl, f ® T ^ , ?. bass!l 1 &lt;Ic '; at Constantinople that the Trncial Chiefs (of which Esau-ibin Khuleefah is one) shall not be interfered with. aforl 0 .wTfl t Vf he fr Sl T^ Aba f 1,B ' afte ^ he,i S ht With his htr,thn Paood, (reported in ? f °™? r ,et ' e ' ) fled to the Turks, who were his proclaimed ijllies. but latterly he seems to ^, u ®' e 4 them and has S 1 ™ 0 them the slip, in the hope of uniting the Arab tribes in regard the Turk's 1,01111 a Sa lu st the invading ** Heretics ' as they, being strict Wababees, The idea evidently having forced itself on bis mind that the Turks intend makinff a permanent settlement in the country, I cannot but regard as intentional a eironmstanco that occurred the other day Ihe Turk Commodore when he arrived at Bahrein hoisted the Turkish flag' and saluted ifc with 21 guns. I regarded this as an act of sovemgnty. I distinctly saw that it was the Turkish flag, and suggested to Colonel Pelly that the question should be asW 'who the sa ute wa« intended for.' The Commodore explained that having no 'Arab ' flaff on board he had used his own, being the nearest in appearance to it, and that the salute was in honor of the Arab forts. This explanation could not well be taken exception with but it shows there is a tendency to assert the Otttoman authority in these waters,—who ever 'thought of saluting an Arab mud fort half ruined with 21 guns ; five guns is the usual Arab ealute— three guns for smaller Chiefs. The belligerents before the Turks appeared on the scene were represented bv thp brntW- Abd'alla and Saood, sons of the late Chief u Fasur'—tbe independent tribes siding with one brother or the othpr, they fought for the Chieftainship with varied success. The Wababee territory is a considerable portion of Central Arabia called ' Nejid propei lv speak ing they have no sea-board. Yet the province of Hassa with the sea ports oi Katiff and Ojair, such as they are (you can hardly get within sight of them, too shoal) acknowledged their sway till the Turks came. A true Arab, it would seem, loves war for its own sake. There are of course, many commercial and trading Arabs especially the coast inhabitants; but the nobler tribes hold them in contempt. Saif-bin-Ali, I can fancy, expressed but the feelings of himself and his people without exaggeration when at a protracted war council he cut all argu ment short by saying—' Blood is man's only dye, and war like the manna and quails is 'as • 'IiDains and Syeds of Oman,' by G. P. Badger, U f' + i ■^' V f Z 10 a l so that, with F.R.C.S. ^ res P eGt to the Wahabees. there may be some , , , , . amount of personal feeling. The Turks undoubtedlv feel they have a score to settle with them. The Wahabees (I think under Abd'alla oreat grandfather of the present man, at the beginning of this century, but I have no books 'to refer to. I have only at various times been able to peep into books, which 1 have been oblio-ed to return, and trust to memory, which I find has not improved under the boilino- process of the last year) captured a Mecca/'plundered the pilgrims, its inhabitants and its mosque and defiled the sacred ^Cauba,' plundered and turned back the caravan of the then reio-nina' Sultan of Turkey's sister who was making the sacred pilgrimage. ^ b The Wahabees hate pilgrimages and don't respect Mecca. Mr. Palgrave, in his Central and Eastern Arabia,' describes them as Puritans that move about with a sanctimonicus face and demeanour, allowing of neither smoking, laughing, drinking of wine, or silk thread in the ornamentation of their garments, whose only source of lawful enjoyment and recreations must be found in women, fighting, and praying.

The Foreign Secretary Mr. Aitchisons' note on these reports^ discloses the ^iews of tlie Government of India on the problems and is quoted below:— •' I do not suppose the Secretary of State expects any expression of the views of the Gov ernment of India on Commander Dought /s exposition of Gulf politics. _ Government have already written fullv and repeatedly to state to the Secretary of State their objections to the Presence of a large Turkish force in the Gulf, and T don't see that any further writing w.U do anv ffood. It might, perhaps, be enough to acknowledge this despatch, refer to our vauous lettefs, and tell the Secretary of State that it would be well to send an early answer. There is any great deal that is both suggestive and true in Commander Doughty s letter. It is generally understood that, since we threw the Turks over m the Black Sea affair, they are on faf better terms with Russia than they ever were before. ^ hatever may be their ultimate obiect it is bejond dispute that the Turks have, within the last two years, shown ^y difi- nosition to extend their authority in Arabia and in the Person Gulf both by sea and land. Perhaps it is inevitable ; and possibly the time has gone bye for the maintenanoe of our exc u- S iv e authoVtv in the Gulf. I hope not ; but it looks very like it, and it certainly will be the case if the Secretary of State leaves our numerous despatches on Gulf P^ tlc ' unanswered But, however, that may be, 1 think the opening of Jhe Suez Canal has made ten times more our interest to be on good and intimate terms with Turkey than it e ver ™ before and the course taken in the Black Sea discussions is much to be regretted so far as the interest of India is concerned. Turkey is a far more valuable al y than Persia i. and w l, continue to be under the thumb of Russia. We can hardly expect to compete successfully wi h Russi^or influence in Persian counsels. When General Goldsmid was in Calcutta he to d me that the Shah did not take a single step in the discussions about the Mekran bound ry without consulting the Russian Minister. Now that the overland carrying trade from China has been ruined hy the opening of the canal 1 look uron it as a matter of certainty that the Russia will sooner or later have a port ^ thePcHan Gnlf for her commerce. We shall then be brought face to face with bigger Questions than have arisen during the Nejd campaign, and it is ot the utmost importance before that event occurs, that our position in the Gulf should be put on a well recognized and sound footing and all causes c£ irrilalion with Turkey and Persia removed. If the discussions S tble Powers are ever to he amicably settled and, what is more important, settled m our favour,It murt be now. it will never be done if we put oft till some other buropean lower has established itself in the Gulf. 267 About the close of the year 1871, there were rumours that in addition '• to the Lebanon and Iskandena several Secret, April 1872, Nos. 99-103. more Turkish vessels would be stationed on the Persian Gulf. Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople was directed to make the necessary enquiries from Server Pasha. The answer of Server Pasha was that he was not aware of any such intention. He howe e added that :— « Bussrah has always been, and still is a Turkish Naval station, that f e number of steamers a ?t^ a % employed on ^he Ai^ian Coast ^ se^n, two o w^ic ^are, conduct the gLtitude of tbe Ottoman Government.' 268 Her Majesty's Government at last directed their Ambassador at zoo. * Constantinople to make a representation to Secret, September i87i, Nos. 20-28. porte in regard to the Turkish pro ceedings in the Persian Gulf, in the Foreign Secretary's Despatch No. 20, dated 6th June 1872, which is quoted below : — &lt;f T have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the number of vessels employed in those waters. tt Maicstv's Government, however, consider that as long as Turkey is engaged m upholdmg its legitimate it considers necessary for doin &amp; so, at authority which would raise questions expect that no attempt will be made to state o'f things must isarily cause the British Govern- ment to take counteracting steps to reareure the public mind.68 If the presence of an excessive Turkish force requires the Indian Government to increase the British force in the Gulf, the Native mind will see in the latter an encouragement, not only to resist, but to thwart the Porte, and things will go on from bad to worse, till at last, even in the admitted Turkish districts, a general feeling of uneasiness will be produced, and will cost the Porte more to subdue or mitigate than the country is worth. I have, therefore, to instruct Your Lordship, while expressing to the Porte the views of Her Majesty's Government on this point, to state that they will gladly use their good offices to restore peace and bring matters to a normal state of tranquillity/' 259. The British Ambassador reported the action taken by him in his des patch No. 61, dated 23rd June 1872 :— ' I communicated to Server Pasha Your Lordship's despatch, No. 20, of the 6th instant, and pointed aut to him how important it was that the Porte should not go on increasing its armaments in the Persian Gulf, so as to disquiet the neighbouring countries, and to oblige Her Majesty's Government to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. Server Pasha repeated the assurance, already so often given, of the absence of all intention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts, where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government might be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha, there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations. 'With regard to the presence of a large Turkish force in the Persian Gulf, His Excellency thought Her Majesty's Government must be under some misapprehension it being in reality of very insignificant proportions, amounting inall tofour ships-ot-war, of which two are ordered to Constantinople to refit. The other vessels are hired transports, that had been taken up for the conveyance of the troops sent to the Nejd.

He is said* also for the same reason to have later requested the removal of the Turkish vessel stationed off Katar, ostensibly, but quite unnecessarily, for the protection of the boats engaged in pearling. In October 1896, the Turkish Garrison at Bidaa was relieved of 400 troops, conveyed in the Turkish gunboat Zuha. 272.

The proposal, it appears, em anated from the Maritime prefect of Basrah, and the Minister of Marine placed two or three naval officers at his disposal with a view to their appointment to such places in the Persian Gulf as be thought fit. Sir O'Conor, however, thought it probable that the officials would be found incapable and certain that their salaries would be unpaid.73 CHAPTER SEVENTH. (1) Trade delations of Hindu and other traders of Bahrein with Katif, and their disabilities. (2) Proposed appointment of a Consular officer at Katif. 273. If there is one fact more than another to prove the advantages India History of the trade. has derived from the British connection with the Persian Gulf, it is the blessing of free and unrestricted commerce, which Indian merchants have enjoyed with Katif for nearly half a century, to be interrupted only by the extension of Turkish 'See Mr. Gaskin's report, datad 2nd August; 1903—- influence to that CjUafter. J-heir'' business Proceeding No. 4 in External A., January 1904, relations with Katif Were first established NoB ' 3 ' 4 ' ^ in the year 1864 by a wealthy Kutchi, named Kalungi, who carried on a general trade for twelve years on his own behalf as well as other Hindu trading houses. In 1866 another enterprising Hindu named Telandas Khubchand with a staff of six assistants established a house of business, and two years later he took a partner named Sandal bin Kisu into the business. This firm appears to have carried on a large trade till 1876, when it had to withdraw from Katif owing to the incurrence of heavy losses through the bankruptcy of many of their leading native clients brought about by the total failure of the Indian pearl market. The large firm of Assanmul Anadram &amp; Co. opened a branch office at Katif also in 1866 and con tinued to do business there for about 18 years, first the agency of Mulchand Jairamdas and latterly under that of Sandal bin Kisu. Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas &amp; Co. in 1880 sent three brothers named Tarachand, Darsinglt, and Tekchand Dwarkadas to conduct business for thera, and another capitalist named Damanmal Lalchand established himself there till his death 3 years later. The former tirm, however, kept up its trade there till 1895 when Tekchand was muiilated by the notorious pirate Ahmed bin Selman on the high sea. Besides the big firms mentioned, a number of petty Hindu traders visited Katif periodically and at one time it is said they numbered about sixty persons. 274. It has not been possible to ascertain definitely the aggregate amount of capital employed by the Hindu firms in the Katif trade, but at one time it must have been considerable owing to the fact that, prior to the Turkish occupa tion of the port and for a few years subsequent to that event, they controlled the greater portion of the trade which was principally in rice, cotton goods, sugar, coffee, spices, metals, and hardware imported from India via Bahrein, and pearls, dates and hides exported to the same country. During the five years ending in 1805 their trade with Katif, when about a third of the former number of traders of their community shared in it, the value of the merchandise bought and sold by them was between seven and eight lacs of rupees annually, and judging from these figures, the volume of trade cairied on by them when their prospects were better may be considered to have been about fifteen lacs of rupees annually without risks of over-estimation. 275. The causes which led to the withdrawal of the Hindus from Katif date from about three or four years after the establishment of a Turkish Custom House in the port wi h a system of farming the revenues, which obtains to the present day. The farmers of the Customs to meet the exactions of the Turkish officials gradually and illegally increased the duty from 1 per cent, to 6 per cent, on the Hindu merchandise, which placed them at a great disadvantage in competing with the more fortunate native traders whose local influence obtained for them better treatment. The unprotected condition of the Hindus exposed them to the avarice of the petty Turkish officials, who at the instigation of wealthy Katif merchants in most instances put such obstacles in their way, as the delay of weighment of dates for purposes of ascertaining the amount of duty payable, the prohibition of donkeys transporting the merchant- dise to the boats for shipment, detaining Indian sailing craft in quarantine for '[C967FD] V74 unreasonable periods, though they may have been over two months out from India, and paying no attention to claims filed by them for debts recoverable from Turkish subjects. 276. The unsettled condition of the Katif district since 1885, and the attempt made on the high sea by the pirate Ahmed bin Selman in the same year to murder Tikamdas Dwarkadas who escaped with the loss of his right hand and Rs. 40,000 worth of pearls, further discouraged them from continuing their residence in that district and obliged them to carry on their business transactions through local merchants who did not always look after the interests of their principals, and finally Messrs. Gungaram Tikamdas three years ago made another attempt to establish themselves there and sent across one of their Mahomedan employes named Haji Jima bin Naser, who was repelled by the Turkish officials, and from that date the Hindus practically suspended direct trade with Katif. 277. We shall also note below a few specific complaints of Indian and Bahreinese traders which were brought to the notice of Government. 278 In January 1884 a complaint was made by a Nakoda of a native ^ vessel Mubarak owned by a British Indian Ka^m4^ an vessel y trader for forcibly compelling him to external a,— october 1884, nos. 434—440. convey Turkish soldiers from Katif to March 1895, nos. 109—16g. Ojair. K note verable vr&amp;s addressed by the British Ambassador to the Porte requesting that a suitable indemnity might be paid to the Captain of the ship and that orders might be sent to the Turkish authorities at Basrah not to impress vessels flying the British Flag. A copy of this note was sent by Assim Pasha to the Vali at Baghdad, and Mr. Plowden was asked to do his utmost to have the question settled. In reply to an enquiry by Mr. Plowden, Colonel Hoss fixed a sum of Rs. 50 as a reasonable compensa tion. 279. In January 1893 the Chief of Bahrein complained to us regarding the „ I . levy of port dues and capitation tax on Levy of port dues and capitation tax on Bahrein , i .,. • i i? -p boats and subjects at Katij. Bahrein boats and their crews at Katif. external a, march 1893,noa. 108—113. The Political Resident reported, however, (Letter No. 32, dated the 15th February 1893):— ' The fees referred to are levied on all vessels alike and not on Bahrein boats in particular. The port of Katif is under Turkish suzerainty, and therefore no legitimate grounds for our interference in the matter would appear to exist. The Chief of Bahrein accordingly been informed that it would not be possible to address the Ottoman Government upon the subject, but that if, owing to the levy of ports dues or other fees by the Turkish authorities, the voyage to Katif is no longer profitable, the boat owners can legitimately raise their present rates of freight to Turkish ports. I have also communicated with the Resident in Turkish Arabia in the above sense. 280. The Indian merchants also complained of the excess of export 'Non-refund of excess export duties levied, duties levied OU them at OUC time. Secret E.— January 1896, Nos. 132—143.

Of this 8 per cent. 7 per cent, are to bo returned on production, within 121 days, of certificates showing that the goods in question have really reached Indian ports. Though this is the rule, British Indian traders from Bahrein had, for a long time, been exporting dates to India from Katif without knowing that they were entitled to a refund, the Turkish Customs authorities keeping the 7 per cent, which they should have refunded. 280-A. Though the matter was first brought to the notice of this Residency many years back, it does not appear to have been taken up strongly till 1895, when the traders petitioned, and a protracted correspondence was commanced75 through the British authorities in Turkish Arahia. The result of our representa* tions was that we at last, obtained a refund of the excess duty paid on all consignments in 1894-95, for which certificates could he procured, and we were able to hand over Rs. 5,012-9-0 to the British Indian traders at Bahrein, who had established their claims to our satisfaction. The amount was divided rate- ably among them, and the sura given in each case was gladly accepted, a receipt being obtained from each individual. 281.

Their grieyance was that certain native merchants at Katif, who had seats in the local Government Council, took advantage of their position and used their influence with the customs authorities to delay passing the banias' merchandise for export until after their own had left the port, so as to have the advantage of being the first to arrive at the market of destination and thereby securing the higher price. 282. There is a large export trade of boiled dates from Katif to Karachi, External a. August 1931. No. 4 i9. amounting to about 150,000 bags annually, besides a large import of rice and other goods from India via Bahrein. Katif is also the market for pearls procured by the Koweit pearling fleet. The banias offered to pay the expenses, if a native agent was appointed by Government at Katif to look after their interests. Mr. Gaskin finally suggested that he should visit the Kaimakam of Katif to arrange matters. 283. In reporting the matter to the Government of India the Political Resi- external a, mi, No. ^ent in the Persian Gulf intimated that he did not propose to take any omcial action and that he had told Mr. Gaskin to let the matter drop. I84i. In 1901, the Consul at jBasrah made representations to the Wali of Secret E., October 1901, Koa. 340-341. that , place, and the latter undertook to send such instructions (through the Mutessarif of El Hassa) to the Kaimakam of Katif as would remove the disabilities under which Bahrein banias trading at Katif laboured. The Consul at the same time suggested that Mr. Gaskin should be made Vice-Consul for Katif, as there was a doubt whether the Turks would agree to the appointment of a native agent. 285. No action was tal^en by the Government of India, but it was noted in this department that if it turned out that the Wali's instructions to the Kaima kam of Katif had been without effect, the Basrah Consul's suggestion would seem well worthy of consideration. 286. In July 1903, Colonel Kemball stated that he did not put much faith External A., January 1904, Noa. t-4. (Pro. No. in the professions of the Mutessarif of El 3 ) • Hasa, and doubted if ■ he had the power to support the banias against the oppression of their Mahomedan rivals at Katif. 287.

In submitting this to the Government of India, Colonel Kemball gave •p ... inn . ^ , /tJ „ ^ it as his opinion that a fair case had been External a., January 1904, No». 8-4, (Pro. No. 4). , . . ,, x 'UT t, x made out for requiring the establishment of a Consular officer at Katif to look after the interests of the Hindu traders.76 289. No action was taken by the Government of India, but tbe case was dis cussed personally by Secretary with Colonel Kemball, during His Excellency the Viceroy's recent tour in the Persian Gulf, and the Bahreinese traders were told by Secretary that the question was under consideration pending decision about raising status of Bahrein Agency and Vice-Consulate for Katif and Ojair. 290. A recent complaint was made by Tekchand Dwarkadas, a Cutchi . merchant (referred to in paragraph 273) Section E, May 1904, Nos. 6— . that the customs farmer demanded a duty of 12 per cent, on the date exported from Katif to Cutch. Under the Commer cial agreement between Turkey and Parsia dated 5th September 1903, the 12 per cent, export duty on goods destined for Persia was abolished, and under the arrangements existing before the treaty, a refund of 11 per cent, would have been made on the dates exported to British Indian ports, but in the case of dates exported to Cutch ports the full 12 per cent, duty would have been levied and no rebate made. Now that the treaty referred to has abolished the 12 per cent, duties, there was, in the opinion of Colonel Kemball no longer any reason for claiming the deposit in the case of the goods sent out to India and elsewhere, Colonel Kemball, however, thought that little good would result from attempting to obtain a refund of the over charges made, but if it were decided to appoint a Consular representative at Katif, a good case would have made out for such a step. 291. The question then of appointing a Consular officer at Katif was dis cussed in the Foreign Department, and the following despatch addressed to the Secretary of State (No. 3, dated the 31st Mareh ^£01):— No. 74, Secret E., dated Fort William, the Slst March 1904. From— The Government of India, Foreign Department. To—The Right Hon'ble St. John Bbodeick , His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. ' We have the honour to forward^ for your information, copies of the correspondence noted in the schedule annexed, regarding our commercial interests at Katif. Prior to the Ottoman occupation of El Hassa, a flourishing settlement of Indian traders carried on business at this port. In 1874 the place became the head-quarters of a Turkish Kaimmakairj; a Customs House was instituted; aud official regulations have since been so used, ar rather abused, as to destroy the British trade which had previously been established. An export duty of 1 per cent, has practically been converted into one of 8 per cent, by the demand that a deposit of this amount should be made on the value of all dates exported. This exaction was ostensibly intend ed to prevent the diversion of cargo to the Persian coast, exports to which were previously chargeable with a duty calculated at that rate. Every possible difficulty appears, however, to have been placed in the way of obtaining a rtfund even on proof of the goods having readied a British destination. Remonstrances have from time to time been lodged with the responsible Turkish officials. In 1899 Colonel Meade, onr Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, reported that, as the result of a protracted correspondence, the refund had been procured of a sum of Rs. 5,012-9-0, out of a total amounting apparently to some Rs, 15,000 ; which certain traders had been required to deposit in accordance with the practice which we have noticed. But the abuse has not been checked. 2. Other complaints which have been received have charged the local officials with deliberately hampering Indian traders by delays in Cuftom-hous« formalities, by prohibition of the supply of transport, and by the use of quarantine regulations as a pretext for the detention of Indian craft which had been cleas: of infected ports for periods entitling them to exemption from restraint even under the most rigid sanitary rules. In 1900, Colonel Meade's successor forwarded correspondence which showed that the bania community at Katif had been reduced from one of 70 or 80 persons to a single trader, and that a party of those were still desirous of carrying on business at th« port had furnished the clearest evidence of the harassment to which they had been subjected by expressing their willingness to pay in advance the cost of maintaining a British Agent to protect their interests on the spot. In view of the antagonism with the Turks into which we had been brought in other parts of the Gulf, we deemed it inadvisable at the time to propose an attempt to obtain the recognition by the Porte of a British representative at Katif. His Britannic Majesty's Consul, however, brought the complaints which had been made to the notice of the Wali of Basrah, who undertook to issue instructions to the Kaimmakam to remove the disabilities under which British traders laboured. Later reports show that these representations have been ineffectual. In 1908 we were informed that our traders still found difficulty in obtaining refunds of deposits, and we have recently heard that illegal dues are still exacted in spite of the exemption of exports to Persia from the duty which previously formed the pretext for such demands. The majority of the sufferers77 sailed straight for their destination as soon as they had cleared their cargoes, and precise figures are not, therefore, available, but it is stated that a sum of about Rs. 25,000 was wrongfully extorted from British traders in respect of dates shipped during the season of 1903. During the Viceroy's recent tour in the Persian Gulf the British Indian merchants of Bahrein renewed, in a petition to His Excellency, their request for the appointment of a British representative to protect their interests at Katif. S. We think that a good case has been made out for such a step, the simplest form of which would probably be to appoint our Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein Vice-Consul for El Hassa, and to station a native Consular Agent at Katif. Should His Majesty's Govern ment be unwilling to take action on this sense, we can only suggest that a clear statement should be made to the Porte of the disabilities to which our traders have been subjected in order that measures may be taken for their mitigation or removal. But our experience of Turkish official action in those parts does not lead us to place any confidence in the results of such a rep^esentation/ , [C967rD]7S CHAPTER EIGHTH- PIEACIES. (I) Piracies in the Katif and Bahrein waters, 1878. 292. The seas between the island of Bahrein and the coasts of Katif and Katar hare for long been the scenes of piracies of Beni Hajir and other mar auding Bedouin tribes of Arabia. We have noticed the depredations commit ted by the Beni Hajirs (noted in the Katar Precis and also the Bahrein Precis) t since the occupation of the Katif district by the Turks in 1871. In 1878 the Bedouin tribes gave a fuller rein to their marauding habits in the Katif waters and the security of the Gulf became so endangered, that the British Gov ernment had to make up their mind either to hold the Turkish Govern ment responsible for the piracies, or to proceed on their own account to put a stop to a intolerable state of things. We now enter into an important epo^h in the political history of the Persian Gulf, and no apology is needed for going minutely into the piratical acts in the Katif waters reported since 1878, and the questions as to the responsibility for order raised thereby.* 193. On the 20th September Colonel Eoss telegraphed that the Beni «,.*• i » « u ,0-0 xt Haiir had seized and plundered some Politic*! A., November 1878, No. 108. ,, J . , _ 0 , ^ ° Persian vessels off Sheikh Shaab, an island on the Persian coast of the Gulf, and wounded two men. The same gang had also plundered another vessel, nationality unknown, carrying off Es. 10,000 in cash and murdering the Nakoda. They had then re-landed on the Katar Coast, and Colonel Eoss suggested that the Ottoman Government should be addressed regarding their proceedings. He then drew attention to Zobarah, a port on the mainland opposite Bahrein, the Chief of which was said to be implicated, and enquired whether there was any objection to his dealing direct wirh that place and using coercive measures if necessary. Turkish rule, he said, had never been asserted there, and the clnim of Bahrein to exercise authority had been disallowed by the Government of India 294. Onthe2tth the Resident telegraphed as^in reportin? the result of Political a., November 1878, Ko, 112. inquiries made by Her Majesty's Ship V ulture. It appeared that responsibilitv for the outrages complained of rested partly with the Turkish districts o'f Katif and Bidaa, but in a greater degree with Zobarah, whence two vessels had been despatched under the Chief's son to attack a passing boat belonging to Katar. The Chief of Bahrein had also incurred serious culpability by re^ ceiving the Chief of Zobarah and his son as guests and by other acts.* Sneedv and severe punishment of Zobarah seemed to Colonel Koss the first measur'e requisite ; the Tu ks would not, he thought, be able to co-operate inasmuch as they were fully occupied in dealing with the Wahabis. Political A., November 1878, No. 116. 293. On the 5th October the GoTCTn- ment of India telegraphed to the Eesident as follows;— 'Your te'egrams, 2ntli and 24th September.

' 297. On the 17tli October the Resident applied for further instructions Political a., december 1878, No. 4, on certain points connected with his re ference to the Turkish authorities. He was told in reply (dated 12th October) that it was intended that he should address the Governor of Basrah, to whom, within reasonable limits, the nature, ex tent, and time of punishment should be lelt. British naval assistance was only to be granted on condition that the Turks employed regular forces. The Bedouins were not to be interfered with by land, but authority was given to suppress piracy by sea. 298. On the 21st October Colonel Ross reported that the Vulture bad } Political a ., December 1878. No. 6. captured 15 piratical dhows off Katif and surrendered tht j m to the Turkish Gov ernor. Ibree other dhows and four boats had been captured from the Beni Hajir south of Katif, two of them bein? Bnhrein vessels. The Resident's proceedings were approved and a full report called for. 299. On the Slst October the Resident telegraphed further about Zobarah. Political A., December 1878, No. 23. IIe bad T ^sonally laid before the Gov ernor of Basrah the evidence against thnt place. Qhe Governor had undertaken its punishmrnt, but. desired first to verify proofs by independent evidence. CoWl Ross had offered naval assistance, hut the Governor evidently was not desirous to avail himself of the offer ; at the same time he promised to repress and punish offenders elsewhere. Colonel Ross also informed the Governor of the operations of the VuUure noted in the preceding paragraph and showed him the Governor of KatiPs written acknowledgment for the captured vessels. These communicntions were received with attention and apparently in a friendly spirit. In reply, the Govern ment of India instructed Colonel Ross to report the measures taken by the Turkish authorities for the punishment of Zobarah, or, if they refused, to ask their reasons for holding back. 300. On the 15th November Colonel Ross telegraphed that the Command- Folitical A., December 1878, No. 48. er S S. Arab at Bahrein ■wrote that he had received a report of the capture of Zobarah by the Sheikh of Bid;.a and the Bahrein refugee Nasir bin Mobarik at the head of a larpe force of Bedouins. There were fears of an attack on Bahrein, whither Colonel Ross was pioceeding in Her Majesty'* 8. Teazer. The Government of India approved this visit, and desired Colonel Ross to keep Bahrein to its treaty obligations; he was again authorized to preserve the maritime peaee of the Gulf, and desired to abstain from interference with land operations. He was also asked for information as Piiiticai As December 1^78, No. 49. to the position of Zoharah towards the ' Ko ' 51 * Turkish Government. He replied on the 22nd confirming the attack upon Zobarah which had been entirely destroyed with the exception of an outlying fort called Moreyr, in which the Nairn in habitants were closely besieged. The attack was said to be in retaliation for piracies and raids upon Bidaa and had not been ordered by the Turkish Gov ernor of Basrah. The Bahrein people were alarmed, but Colon' 1 Koss had n&lt; titled that any attempt on Bahrein would be forcibly repelled by the British ships, and precautionary measures to this end had been taken. The Turkish Governor of Basrah had als &gt; sent to warn Bidaa against attacking Bahiein. Colonel Boss had no interfered with land operations. With regard to Zobarah, the Residen observed as follows u About po it-wm Zoba^ah towards Turks —Hitherto no relations exiVted as Bahrein claims over Zobar.ih were disallowed by Gjvernment of India in 1874 ; and Government *80 would I purpose, not oppose establishment of Turkish antliority on that part of Guttur coast. Present circumstances will probably lead to that measure. Viewing from all points this seems best and calculated to terminate frequent recurrence of panics at Bahrem. thief of Bahrein concurs in this view. I think further interference unnecessary regarding punishment ot Zoba- rah, as ample retribution has befallen the place.' ; 301.

The first of these relates the facts on which the President's telegram, dated Slst October, referred to in paragraph 299 of this note, was based. 302. FoliowiDg the instructions of the Government of India, Colonel Ross started for Basrah on the 22nd October, harins; first obtained from Colonel Nixon an introductory letter to the Wali. He also ordered the I ulture which had just returned to Hushire after capturing the dhows off Katif, as related in paragraph 2J8 of this note, to accompany him to Basrah to explain matters if neeti should arise. Colonel Boss was courteously received by the Pasha, exchanged visits with him, and discussed the Zobarah affair. On this point there is nothing to add to the summary in paragraph 299 of this note which narrates with sufficient fulness what passed at their interviews. Colonel Ross, however, adds the following remarks ?— ' The Wali was, I think, at first rather suspicious of some other object being covered by my communicaticns about piracies. I endeavoured to remove any such impression l»y describing to His Excelleuey the importacce attached by the British Government to the security of these seas, which has been attained by so great an expenditure of labor and treasure, and explaining how recurrence of instances of plunder and murder, unimportant as they might seem in themselves, would, if unchecked and unpunished) soon destroy, the fruits of the labor of so many years. ' Abdulla Pasha is known to be a religious fanatic, and be somewhat openly gives vent to anti-English sentiments. Mr, Robertson informed me that in consequence he found himself much cut off from the friendly intercourse which he used to have with persons of good social position in Basrah. The state of feeling seems unfortunate at present so much so that I feel it a duty to Government to mention the matter. u Most well-informed persons seem to agree that the one person competent to maintain the province of Nejd in good order and subjection for the Turkish Government is Nasir Pasha of the Montefik tribe, now at Constantinople. It is thought also that he would be well disposed towards British interests, especially if British influence should contribute to his re appointment to the Basrah Pashalik. 303. The next report deals with the circumstances summarized in • „ ,, ^ ^ , Cil paragraph above 300 with the attack Ko'rtaTsts t ' on Zobarah by the Shiekh of Bidaaand Political A., January 1879, No. 238. Nasir bin Mubarik. SOI. On hearing of this fresh complication Colonel Ross proceeded to Bahrein, where he arrived on the 17th November. He found the Arah anchored there, whose Commander, Captain Dicken, had taken suitable pre cautionary measures. The Chief of Bahrein, Sheikh Esau, came on board the Teazer and pressed for some action in favour of Zobarah ; he also asked to accompany Colonel Ross in his visit to that place. He urged that if Zob arah were occupied by his enemies (the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Moba- rik), Bahrein would incur constant danger, and be exposed to sudden attacks. Further that his failure to aid the Nairn people would turn them into enemies. Colonel Ross declined these requests, and directed the Chief to abstain from all interference in Zobarah affairs, a decision which greatly dissatisfied him. 305. Colonel Ross then proceeded to Zobarah and found the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Mobarik arranged against Moreyr. He writes— On ' the 18th, Captain Wodehouse took me round in the Itater to Zobarah, where he and I landed and visited the camp of Jasim bin Mahomed Thanee, the El- Bida Sheikh. He81 appeared to have about 2,000 armed men under him, and was pitched about half a mile from the square fort of Moreyr, in which the Naeem inhabitants of Zobarah to the number of perhaps 500 were besieged. There seems to have leen no Kghting as the Naeem were much out-numbered. The Bahrein refugee, Nasir bin Mubarick, was somewhere in the vicinity with another band of Bedouins, but his camp was not visible. The town of Zobarah, which appears to have been a large place at some time, was entirely in ruins. The fort called Moreyr is about a mile from the town and inland. No boats were left at Zobarah, and it was report ed a few had been burnt. ' 306. Here it may be noted that before leaving Bushire Colonel Ross telegraphed to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia and to Mr. Eobertson at Basrah with the object of acquainting Abdullah Pasha with what had occured and so affording him an opportunity of taking prompt and effectual action. On returning to Bahrein on the 19th November, Colonel iloss found the following telegram from the Turkish Governor awaiting his arrival, with a request that it might be forwarded to the Kaimakan at Katif ' Jasim bin Mahomed bin Thani, Chief of Bidaa, with Nasir bin Mubarick, who had been expelled from Baherin, having with some troops attacked Zobarah, a depandency of Guttur, it appears they will attack Bahrein also. Though in the event of their attack on Bahrein, those who are in the latter place will prevent them, still the movement involves difficulties. Thus has the matter been intimated by Her Britannic Majesty's Consul General in Bushire, who himself will also proceed to Bahrein. If this circumstance be correct, it will never be toler ated (lit. rendered passable), though security and peace be extremely desirable and necessary in those parts. You ought instantly to send steampship Iskende' ia with some troops to Zobarah to warn and caution the Chief of Bidaa against such movements, and preserving those parts from being prevailed over by the insurgents. You will endeavour your utmost in pacifying and keeping the same secure, and report your action with the result thereof to me. } 307. Colonel Eoss delivered the message to the Commander of the Turkish gun-boat Iskanderia which he found anchored at Has Tanoorah, and promised to report the action taken by the Turkish local authorities as soon as known. Colonel Ross concluded his letter by recommending the establishment of a Turkish post at Zobarah or in its vicinity as the best means of preserving permanent tranquillity. The Chief of Bahrein had intimated his acquiesc ence in this view. 308. The piracies committed by the Beni Hajir and others, which w^ere reported in various letters and telegrams from Colonel Ptoss, do not, for the most part require a detailed notice. A complete list of them will be found in the tabular statement appended to this note. It appears that Zahran, a hill twenty miles south of Katif, and Zobarah have an evil notoriety as the prin ciple places of resort for the piratical tribes. 309. There are, however, two sets of piracies included in this list which cannot be passed over without remark. (Politic ' &gt;1 A ' The first set is dealt with in the letters. Letter »o. 205, dated 2i8t September. (Political &amp;C., cited in the margin, and are to be b, July 1879, No. 66.) noted, because the Chief of Bahrein and I ' 0TCBber ' (Po,itic • I his subjects were implicated. Inquiries made by Captain Jauncy of the Vulture gave the following result:— *'(1.) On the 4th September, a boat belonging to Katur was boarded at sea near Zobarah by Mohamed bin Rashi bin Jubba, son of the Chief of that place. Three persons were killed and five wounded, and property plundered to the value of upwards of 700 dollars. The Chief of Zobarah watched the outrage from From Resident Persian Gulf, No. 2^ dated the top of his fort and r ebuked his SOU for not 3rd November. (Political A. January 18/9, I ho. • , 1 , , •« i . , . 185.) having killed the whole party and burnt the boat instead of bringing on shore witnesses to the deed. The Chief of Bahrein entertained the Sheikh of Zobarah and his son after the affair. '*(2.) On the 2nd of September, two boats with 50 armed m^n sailed from Bahrein for a cruize round the island. Leaving their territorial waters they proceeded to Zahran oi the mainland, quarrelled with some Bedouins and seized a boat. The ChieFs excuse was that the boats had gone over to Zahran without his orders. Captain Jauncy informed him that he was responsible for the acts of his followers, and the Chief has promised to produce the three leaders in the affair if called upon. [C967JFD] u82 '&lt; (2,) On tlie 4tli September, abatil named Amorfuk, a boat named Salmah, beloi^- ine to the Bazaar Master, and a small palling boat, manned by about one hundred and fifty men having on board AH bin Esa bin Tarif, Sayid bin Ahmed (Bazaar Master) and Sultan bin Salama, left Bahrein in the morning by the Sheikh s orders to cruize to Tasht Dibal. Arriving there, they proceeded on to Ras Rekhan, where they met two boats belonging to natives^of Oman. They hailed them to anchor, but the boats refusing to do so, the Bahrein boats fired at them, alleging as an excuse for doing so that they thought they belonged to the Beni Hajir tribe. One man in one of the boats was shot through the arm. The boats then stopped, and on the Bahrein boats coming up with them they found that they belonged to the tribe of Zaid bin Kalifa (of Abuthabi). Here again the Sheikh s excuse^ was that bis men had disobeyed orders. He has agreed to produce the leaders if necessary. 310. In the letter cited on the margin, Colonel Ross reported the measures taken to punish these offences. ihe No. aw, dated 3rd NovemW. (Political a, Ja- leaders been fined, compensation had nuary 1879, Kp. 186.) been ordered for the wounded sailor ot Abuthabi, and a letter of apology sent from the Chief of Bahrein to the Chief of Abuthabi. 311 The remaining case is that reported in the Resident's letter No. 260, dated 27th November 1878, which en- Poiiticai A, January 1879, No. 251. closes correspondence between Colonel Eoss and Mr. Melvill, acting Commissioner in Sind. The subject is an attack by pirates about two nailes from Katif on two boats—the Marsingar and the Fultehkar —belonging to British subjects on their ret 1 urn x ,1°^® from Katif to Kurrachee. The Earsingar was plundered of about lis. 200 worth of property *. the Futtehkar lost nothing, but was fired into. Mr. Melvill pressed for redress as the sufferers were British subjects. In reply Colonel Ross informed him that the offenders were Bedouin Arabs residing in Turkish territory, and that the outrage appeared to have perpetrated within Turkish territorial waters. The matter had been brought to the notice to the Turkish authorities through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. He added that the Vulture had already inflicted some punishment on Katif pirates, and it was hoped that further measures for punishment and com pensation would be undertaken by the Turkish authorities. 312. In his letter No. 242, dated 2nd November, Colonel Ross enclosed Captain Pringle's reports of the operations of the Vulture against the dhows of Katif summarized in paragraph 298.86 313. On the 17th September 1878 Colonel Koss forvrarded a translation of Political i, January 1879, No. 258. 3 lette . r the N ^S- Agent at Bushire reporting the proceedings of the Com mander of the Turkish gun-boat Iskanderia which, as mentioned in paragraph &lt;:06 of the memorandum above quoted, had been sent by the Turkish authorities to Zobarah to caution the Chief of Bidaa against any movement on Bahrein. The Commander of the Iskanderia had made peace between the Chief of Bidaa and the Naeem tribe, most of whom had gone to Bidaa. 314 On the 11th January 1879 we wrote to Colonel Eoss concurring with Political A, January 1879, No. 260. J' 8 th ^ the Chief 0f Z'barah had been sumciently punished for his misdeeds by the loss and injury which he and his people had suffered by reason of the expedition led against them by the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Mubarick. 315. Colonel Ross' action in warning the Chief of Bahrein not to interfere on behalf of Zobarah, and in taking precautionary measures to protect him, was approved. 316. The Resident was also asked for further information regarding the future position of the Turkish Government towards Zobarah. 317. In our letter to the Resident of the same date the acknowledgments of the Government of India were conveyed to the officers and men of the ' VuU ture ' for their services in October 1878, which resulted, as mentioned in paragraph 298, in the capture of a number of piratical dhows off Katif. The services of Commander Pringle of the ' Vulture ' were subsequently acknow ledged by Lord Salisbury in his despatch to the Secretary of the Admiralty of the ith March 1879 (Secret, September i879, No. 15). 318. The measures adopted by the Resident for the punishment of the sub jects of the Chief of Bahrein who fired upon a vessel off Abuthabi, as noted above, were approved, and the Resident was directed to warn the Chief that he would not be allowed to evade responsibility on the plea that his subjects acted without or against his orders. 319. The Resident was instructed to allow the irregularity committed by the Chief of Bahrein in receiving the Chief of Zobarah and his son as guests just after they had been engaged in piracy to stand over, as the matter would be taken up in considering the question of the Turkish authority, over Zobarah. 320. With regard to the case alluded to in paragraph above, in which the _ Beni Hajir attacked vessels belonging to British Indian subjects, the Resident was asked to ascertain, if possible, who the offenders were, as well as the locality of the outrage, i.e., whether it was committed in Turkish terri torial waters. 321. On the 9th January 1879 a telegram was received from Secretary of Political a, january 1879, No. 263. State, in which he asked to be furnished the Persian Gulf. ^ 311 reCent PaperS regardiug pira07 in 322. Our despatch to Secretary of State, No. 6 of 17th January 1879, gave a condensed account of recent cases of piracy, and of the orders issued on^the subject. 323. Two letters from the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, dated 18th and Political a, January 1879, Nos, 266 and 327. 20th November 1878, forwarded the whole i , , ^ ie cori,es p orl dence which had passed between him and Colonel Ross, the Turkish authorities and Constantinople on the subject of piracies. The Political Agent reported that the Turkish author ities wore doing their best to get troops sent down to Nejd, His own opinion87 was that the disorders in Basrah and Nejd would not cease until Nasir Pasha, the Sheikh of the Montefik, was reinstated in his position as Governor, as he and his tribesmen subdued El-Hasa before. 324. The correspondence shows that the frequent piracies which took place about this time were due in a great measure to the disturbances which commenced in September 1878 among the Montefik Arabs and the Beni Sad. 325. On the 27th September 1878, Colonel Nixon reported to Her Political A, January, 1879 No. 286. Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that disturbances bad taken place amongst the Montefik Arabs around Goornah, and that the gunboats Nejd and Iskan- deriah had been despatched to the spot. The cause of the disturbances was the general unpopularity of the Sheikhs whom Abdullah Pasha, the Governor- Generel of Basrah, had appointed to collect the Be venue. Colonel Nixon, remarked that ever since Nasir Pasha had been superseded there had been continual disorder in Basrah. 326. In October 1878, Colonel Nixon reported that the Montefik had Political A, January 1879, No. 293. quieted down owing to the orders issued from Constantinople to Abdullah Pasha to leave matters in the hands of Fahad Pasha, the nephew of Nasir Pasha, the late Governor-General.88 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (II).—Eevolt in Hasa and piracies in Katif and Bahrein waters, 1878-1881. 327. In October 1878 tlie Political Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed ^ to Colonel Nixon, staling that the neigb- Reporfced revolt in El-Hasa. ■, , i e tt- j? ij T j bonrhood or Katit was very nnsaie and that frequent piracies were being committed, and asking whether the Turkish authorities would assent to our acting against pirates. He also reported that the sons of Saud bin Peysal had revolted in province of Hasa and captured Damaum. Abdullah bin Eeysal was said to be supporting the movement and the Turkish authority over the province of Hasa was endangered. Colonel Koss added that urgent orders for the despatch of troops were necessary. 328. Abdullah Pasha, in reply to a telegram from Colonel Nixon, admitted that insecurity to a certain extent existed in the neighbourhood of Katif, but maintained that sufficient troops had already been despatched. The Turkish authorities also declined to accept Colonel Ross' proposal that the British Government should assist them in acting against pirates. The operations of H, M. S. Vulture restored sea communications and rendered the waterway „„ o™ sa f e towards the end of October. Political A., January 1879, Iso. 300, 329. Up to this time reports from Nejd showed that the rising against _ xt 0,= the Turks there had not proved formidable. Political A., January 1879, No. 315. a i c -rr • i i i The Arabs ot Hasa were said to have assured the acting Governor of support in case of attack from outside, but they demanded relief from the misconduct and corruption of the local officials. The principal tribes in revolt were those concerned in the piracies complained of by Colonel Ross, viz., the Beni Hajir, the Ajman, and the Amayer. 330. On the 7th November Colonel Nixon reported to Her Majesty's Political A., ja^j-1878, No. sis. Ambassador at Constantinople that the country near Basrah was quieting down, as the Montefik had heard that Nasir Pasha, their Chief, had been re-appointed Governor-General of Basrah. 331. On the 15th Pebruary 1879 Colonel Ross reported the occurrence of o v.- i . « f v io-q frequent robberies in the villages of Political A., September 18/9, No. 90. -i-&gt; i • ^ i -i -n , Bahrein attended with several murders. Several of the robbers were arrested and severely punished, but the ringleader Ali-bia-Jabir, although captured, managed to effect his escape. There were strong suspicions that his escape was arranged with the cognizance of the Chief, but Sheikh Esau in a letter to Colonel Ross denied this. Ali-bin-Jabir was said to have joined the Beni Hajir pirates. 332. On the 5th March 1879 the Naval Commander-in-Chief was asked Political A, September 1879, No. 98. J 0 Tessel at or near Bahrein so long as the Resident considered the mea sure necessary. 333. In his despatch No. 7 of the 20th Eebruary 1879, Secretary of State Secret, September 1879, No. io. expressed approvalof the measures taken or the repression and punishment of acts of piracy in the waters of the Persian Gulf and adjoining Arab coast, reported in Government of India despatch No. 6 of 17th January 1879. He observed :— 'The facts reported however appear to me to indicate the expediency of an early under standing with the Turkish Government in regard to Ottoman jurisdiction and responsibility for order along the Arabian shore of the Gulf; and it is therefore important that I should receive, at as early a date as possible, the full expression of the views of Your Excellency in Council in the matter.'89 334. Before replying to this despatcli the Government of India, in their Piracies from November 1878 to May 1879. ^ -t ^ Cre ^ ar y State, No. 66 or 22nd May 1879, gave a complete account of the piracies which had occurred subsequent to the issue of their previous despatch of 17th January 1879. The most important events that had occurred in the interval were as follows :— 335. At the latter end of December 1878 Mansoor-hin-Minakhir, a Political a , September 1879, Nos. 145-152. 0 f the Ajman tribe, joined with Zaid-bin-Manomed of the Eeni Hajir, and having forcibly seized a boat belonging to a subject of Bahrein, put out to sea. They attacked two boats in the neiohbourhood of Katif and carried off from one of them property valued at Ks. 20,000. Ten boats conveying Turkish soldiers from Ojair to Katif were in sight, but, on bein^ appealed to decline to inter fere. Colonel Ross brought to notice the impunity enjoyed by Zaid-bin Mahomed and other pirates residing at Zahran in the vicinity of Katif through the apathy and indifference of the Turkish authorities, and expressed an opinion that the seizure of Zaid-bin-Mahomed or his explusiou from Zahran was a measure of primary necessity. The Government of India thereapon, after ascertaining from the Besident, Bushire, that Zahran was within recognized r,^ u -.0*0 xt i e « Turkish jui'^diction, and that Zaid-bin- Pohtical A., September 1879, No. 156. . , , . , , . , Mahomed was a iurkish subject, desired the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to urge the Turkish authorities either to ■ d ,. 4 . , . c , , 1q ,.o xt operate promptly agdinst Zaid-bin-Mahom- Pohtical A., September 1879, No. 153. \ , 1 , 'jt 0 ,. „ Jy . . , ed or to accept tue alternative of British action. 336. Instead of carrying cut these directions Colonel Nixon asked the ■p ,... . » q 1 . 1 cto xr Vali of Basrah whether a British ship of Political A, September 1879, No. 158. . tit ,■ •, war should be sent to check disorder, and referred the same questions to the British Ambassador at Constantinople. The Vali replied that a Turkish corvette had been ordered to cruise in the disturbed parts, and that the Mutassarif of Katif had received stringent instructions to suppress further piracies. 337. Ultimately the Turkish Minister of Marine directed the Broussa or the IsJcanderia, or both, if necessary, to proceed to the Nejd coast, and declared D vt . , ■ 0 t that the Basrah authorities would be held Political A. # September 1879, No 1&amp;4. -t i « .t i j. t . , responsible for the restoration and mainte nance of order. 338. On the 22nd January Colonel Boss reported that Turkish force had „. , . „ marched by land ae-ainst El-Hussein, a Political A., September 1879, Nos. 160—166. ^ J , village nve miles from Zahran, and had destroyed it; but the ringleader and other persons concerned in recent piracies were not captured.

It)2. , t t i ii m i trading vessels; moreover, both the Turk ish vessels of war broke down. 339. On the 14th February 1879, the Eesident in the Persian Gulf tele- ^ . c , , 10(7 q w i/ ti graphed that Zaid-bin Mahomed's success Political A., September 1879, No 171. £ j . i • • e-n- j.'e a hacl led to further piracies of Katif. A fresh gang of the Beni Hajir had started under another leader and captured two Bahrein vessels laden with dates ; afterwards they joined Zaid's band near El-Hussein and departed with their booty into the interior. Subsequently they put to sea a^ain in search of further prizes and closed communication between Bahrein and Katif. The Chief of Bahrein expressed alarm for his islands, and asked either that he might be permitted to take the necessary measures for the recovery of his boats, or that H. M.S. Spartan should act. In Colonel Boss' judgment the piracies were likely to attain formidable dimensions, and to prejudice British prestige and interests; he therefore suggested that the Turkish Government should arrange with the Ejiman tribe to coerce the Beni Hajir, who might be cut off from the sea, and that all the landing places should [ C967FD ]90 be occupied and the coast patrolled, a vessel of war being stationed at Bahrein for a time. 340. The Government of India directed Colonel Ross to order H. M. S. Politic! A., September 1879, No. 172. to Cruise ill the neighbourhood of Katit and to protect Bahrein as required by treaty. He was authorized to suppress piracy by sea and to punish maritime offenders whatever their nationality, but operations on the mainland were prohibited. He was also empowered to place a British officer temporarily at Political a ., September 1879, No. 178. Bahiein, and Captain Durand, the First Assistant to the Resident, proceeded thither. 34)1. On the 15th February Colonel Ross telegraphed that on the 11th Political a ., September 1879, No. 174. February thirty Beni Ilajir from Z a bran had committed a raid on Azaria, 10 miles from Manamah on the larger island of Bahrein, and killed one man. The Chief of Bahrein desired permission to seize the boats in possession of the pirates at Zahian, and begged either for complete protection or permission to attack his enemies by sea. Colonel Ross considered the Chief's fears to be well founded and recommended that our ships of war should be employed against the pirates. Political a ., September 1879, No. 175. was ^ es i re d to report his plans after consultation with the naval officers on the spot. 342. Colonel Ross then recommended the thorough examination of the Political a ., September 1879, No. 178.

The pirates were to be prevented as far as possible from getting boats, and he asked that a British vessel of war should be stationed at Political a., September 1879, No 179. 0I ' ^ iear Bahrein. The Government of , India sanctioned these proposals on the understanning that Colonel Ross plans had been laid fn consultation with the naval oificers, and that no expedition would be undertaken on the mainland beyond reach of the guns of the British vessels. 343. The two vessels stolen from Bahrein were ultimately recovered by Political a „ September 1879, Nos. iso-isi. ^ Vulture^ and early in April the . „ o , , n , . ^ , Resident reported that matters had quieted aown, and that Captain Durand and his escort might leave Bahrein. 344.

It noticed the apprehensions of „ ie ^hier of Bahrein, his application to the British authorities with special re ference to the daring raid on Azaria and the obligations of the British Govern ment towards the Chief. 349. At the close of the despatch in which this description of recent piracies Proposals for suppression of piracies. was transmitted to the Secretarv of State Political A., September 1879, No. .131. f] 1q t ex t h i . -j i ,1 i -m ^ the Government of India called attention to a le.ter, dated 4th March 18/9, which Colonel Nixon, the Political A^ent in Tuikish Aiabia, had addressed to Sir A. Layard, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, on the subject of the piracies in the Persian Gulf, and observed :— Colonel Nixon is not understood to be personally acquainted with the country which he describes, and the accuracy of the information which he has furnished to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople is open to question. In tJealing- with these outrages our difficulty has been that they have been committed either within Turkish territorial waters or in close proximity thereto—a point which Colonel Nixon does not seem to have fully appreciated. That officer further considers that ih« recent piracies in the Gulf have arisen out of quarrels of the tribes on the mainland of Nejd and Bahrein. This view is not shared by Colonel Koss, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who has an intimate knowledge of these localities, and who necessarily possesses far superior means of obtaining information regarding them. According to Colonel Ross no intfr-tribal di^pu'es were goin&lt;r on, and the outrages were committed, for the most part, by well kuown piratical gangs whose sole object was plunder. ' Moreover, on the 20th January and 26.th February, Mr. Robertson, the Political Political A., September, No. 218. Assistant and Vioe-Consul at Basrah, within ' n « ji 228. which Pashalik the Turkish possessions on the Arab coast are situate, informed Colonel Nixon that no disturbance whatever existed in the |interior, but that if order was not restored on the coast the disturbances might spread to the mainland. Nor is there any sufficient evidence, so far as can be ascertained, for the statements that the Turks have conquered years ago all the mainland in the interior from Koweit to Zobarah and that the coast line of p«tty tribes has fallen insensibly under Turkish dominion, and that really all the interests of the Nejd coast rest in Turkey.' 350. Meanwhile Colonel Boss forwarded a copy of a letter from the Com- Poiiticai a., September 1879, Nos. 276-282. mander of _ H. M. S. Vulture in which he gave his opinion of the measures which should be adopted to suppress piracy on the Turkish Arabian coast. His opinion, although arrived at independently, coincided exactly with that expressed by Colonel Boss in his telegram of 28th February 1879. He sug gested that British cruisers, acting on Colonel Ross' requisition, should be permitted to attack the pirates, if necessary, to their bases of operation on the Kejd coast, where their boats and vessels could generally be destroyed or cap tured without going beyond the beach : that the channels west and south of Bahrein should be surveyed, and to assist in these operations he recommended that a steam pinnace should be permanently stationed near Bahrein, with the view also of protecting the islands from the raids of the Bedouins. 351. In reply to Colonel Ross* letter we forwarded to him a letter from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in which he stated his opinion that a steam pinnace was not required, and that the ships detailed for duty in the92 Persian Gulf were amply sufficient for all purposes. His Excellency recom mended that a vessel should be stationed at Bahrein perm inently, until the maraudinor tribes had entirely disappeared, and that the British India Mail Steamers should call at Bahrein in going up and down the Gulf. 362. In our despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 77 of the 23rd June 1879, we forwarded a tabular statement Political a., September 1879, No. 338. compiled by Colonel Ross showing in detail the total reported losses from piracies on the Turkish Arabian coast and the cases in which, in his opinion, the British Government were interested in recovering indemnity. Our despatch also forwarded papers connected with the recent course of events in the Persian Gulf. 353. A translation of Colonel Ross' statement of piracies was given to Abdullah Pasha, the Governor of Basrah, who promised to make enquiries in the matter, and a copy was also sent to Colonel Nixon with a request that he would urge the Turkish authorities (through whatever channel he might deem most effectual) to recover the amount plundered as far as possible. The total losses were estimated at 67,008-25 krans, of which the British Government were considered to be interested in the recovery of 8,834-25 krans. The action taken by Colonel Nixon was to send a copy of the statement to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and another to Mr. Robertson at Basrah. 354. On the 11th March 1879 Colonel Ross visited Bahrein and stayed , - d there till the 18th. He had several inter- Colonel Boss' visit to Banrein in ^on -i i -r^ i i • i March 1879. views with Sheikh Esau, and his brother Political a., september 1879, No. 303. Sheikh Ahmed, and found them in a state of considerable irritation, because of the restraint placed on them in the matter of reprisals towards the mainland, the gist of their complaint being that whilst they themselves were prevented, from acting against the Beni Hajir and others. Colonel Ross has not succeeded in obtaining restitution of property stolen or compensation, nor had the Turkish Government take n steps to punish the piratical Bedouins. 355. Colonel Ross invited Sheikh Esau to state any measures he was desirous of having carried out, and to offer suggestions iu connection with the recent disturbances. Sheikh Esau's requests were— (1) That the Bahrein robber, Ali-bin-Jabir, and his associates, of whose proceedings an account has been given in another part of this precis, and who had been arrested by the Turkish authorities and sent a prisoner to El-Hasa, should be handed over to him for punishment. In support of this request the Chief urged that when certain robbers concerned in the Kashmir piracy at Basrah had fled to Bahrein, he had caused them to be seized and surrendered to the Turkish authorities. Colonel Ross, in reply, promised that he would endeavour to obtain the extradition of the criminals, on the understanding that the Chief would be res ponsible that they did not again escape. (2) That as the port of Zakunniyah, near Ojair, was a resort of pirates, either steps should be taken to prevent its being inhabited, or he should be allowed to send some of his own people to reside there. To this Colonel Ross replied that the place was in Turkish territory, and I that the interference of Bahrein was impossible, but that his statement should be made known to the Turkish authorities. (3) That Colonel Ross would obtain restitution of 311 sheep which had been stolen from Bahrein and landed in Turkish territory. Colonel Ross promised to use his best endeavours in the matter. Besides these specified requests Sheikh Esau intimated his hope and ex pectation that with the aid of the British Government the value of all property plundered from his subjects in Turkish waters would be restored, and that protection would be continued to the islands. \93 He further expressed a wish to take measures to coerce the El-Dowasiri tribe, his own subjects residing in Bahrein, whom he suspected of treason and collusion with the Beni Hajir. On this point Colonel E-oss refused to advise and only expressed a hope that the Chief would be careful not to act so as to cause disturbances on the island. In the letter which contained an account of his visit to Bahrein, Colonel Ross also reported the operations of H. M. S. Vulture in the recovery of another Bahrein vessel which was lying ashore on the beach near Katif. 356. Colonel Ross* proceedings in these matters were approved in our Political A . September 1879, No. 335. letter No. 1501-E. P.. of 2nd June lb79. 357. In pursuance of his promise to the Chief, Colonel Boss wrote to Colonel Nixon on the 31st March sending Foiiticai a ., September 18/9, No. 308. an account of a fresh cnse of piracy in which about 80 Bedouins under Mahomed-bin-Powaz, Dowasiri, had attacked a boat belonging to Ali-bin-Hassan, a subject of Bahrein. He added that until some signal punishment was inflicted on the offending Bedouins by the Turkish authorities, it was idle to expect the former to desist from these mal practices, and he gave the names of the best known leaders of piratical bands— (1) Zaid-bin-Mahomed (Hajiri). (2) Mozi-bin-Tozah (Hajiri). (3) Mahomed-bin-Powaz (El-Howasiri). 358. He then urged Colonel Nixon to move tbe Turkish authorities to grant Sheikh Esau's requests for the extradition of Ali-bin-Jabir and his associates, and for the restoration of the stolen sheep, and to take steps for the proper control of Zakunniyah. 359. Colonel Boss also wrote to Mr. Robertson, the Political Agent at Surrender of Aii-bm j.Wr. Basrah, on the subject, and heard from him i oiiticai a , September 1879, No. 334. that His Excellency Abdullah Pasha of Basrah would authorize the Mutassarif of Nejd to deliver up Ali bin-Jabir and his followers to the Sheikh of Bahrein on his sending an agent to claim and receive them. On this Colonel Ross directed Sheikh Esau to send trustworthy A ^ o,« persons with a letter to the Mutassarif for- Political A., September 1875, No. 3J2 ^ n i i j.* j; 4.1, mally requesting extradition oi the culprits, and stating clearly what crimes they bad committed in Bahrein. Sheikh Esau acted accordingly, but was told by the Mutassarif, on the 15th April, that he was awaiting instructions from Abdullah Pasha. 360. Meanwhile Colonel Ross had been told apparently verbally that the Mutassarif declined to give up Ali-bin- Political A.. September 1879, No. 325. Jabir UnleSS Sheikh Esau gave Up ORC Ali-bin-Hassan, presumably a Turkish subject, accused of having defrauded the Turkish Government whilst employed as an accountant in the service of that Government at El-Katif. Colonel Ro^s immediately addressed Colonel Nixon asking him to move Abdullah Pasha to maintain bis orders for the extradition of Ali-bin-Jabir and his associates irrespective of the case of Ali-bin-Hassan which was of a very different character. He also sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Robertson, who obtained an acknowledgment from the Pasha that the cases of Ali-bin-Hassan and Ali-bin-Jabir were quite distinct and should be treated separately. The Pasha further said that his order for the surrender of tbe robber could not have reached the Mutassarif when he declined to give the gang up. 361. On the receipt of this information Colonel Ross instructed Sheikh Esau to again apply to the Mutassarif for the surrender of the prisoners. 362 On the 16th May Colonel Ross forwarded translation of a report from . , the News Agent at Bahrein, describing the jab a a peratl0tl80ftheGOVem0r of 8a a operations of the Mutassarif or Governor Political a ., September 1879, No. 336. El-Hasa against the Arab village of Jabail situated north of El-Katif. [C967ED]94 The Mutassarlf proceeded to Jabail in the Iskanderiah with some troops and plundered the castle of Sobaih, the inhabitants of which place fled on his approach. 363. On the 30th May 1879 the Turkish blockade runner ArJcadi arrived Arrival of the Arkadi at Basrab. ' at Basrah from Constantinople with two political a., september 1879, no. 502. iif 0 boat cutters, each fitted to carry a small gun. 364. In our despatch No. 91 of ^8th July 1879 we forwarded to Secretary , „ of State copy of two letters from Colonel Political A., September 1879, No. 350. i • i , , (i) No. 167 of 5th May 18/9. Boss. The nrst ot these contained a state- (2) No. i7i of sth „ „ ment drawn up by Colonel Boss, show- Appendlx ' im? the maritime aggressions brought to the notice of the Resident by the Chief of Bahrein, as having been committed on vessels belonging, and persons subject, to his authority. 365. The Government of India observed that the British Resident was bound, by Article 3 of the Bahrein Convention of 1861, forthwith to take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation, and that accordingly application had been made through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to the Turkish authorities at Constantinople. The recovery of four stolen boats by H. M. S. Vulture was also reported. 366. The second letter wa^ a reply to a reference from the Government of India, and contained Colonel Ross' reasons for his non-concurrence with the opinion expressed by Colonel Nixon that the recent piracies in the Gulf had emanated from internecine quarrels among the tribes upon the mainland. Colonel Ross attributed these lawless outbreaks to the neglect of the Turkish local authorities to deal vigorously with the offenders at the beginning. 367. On the 15th July 1879 the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported by Zaid-bin-Mahomed. telegram that Zaid-bin-Mahomed, the Political A.. September 1879. No. 503. notorious Beni Hajir robber, was again engaged in piracy. He had plundered a Bahrein pearl vessel and killed or wounded four persons. The Resident remarked that this was to be expected from the complete immunity enjoyed by the pirates. 368. Colonel Ross was asked by telegram to report the locality of the piracy Political a , September 1879, No. 515. whether it look place in Turkish waters or the open sea, and whether be deemed it necessary to order the British gun-boats to aid on this spot. 369. Colonel Ross* letters Nos. 249 and 261 of the 16th and 19th July 1879 Political a.. September 1875, Nos. 504 and 510 th ough written before the receipt of this , . . telegram, answered the questions contain ed m it. 370. The depredation took place off Ras Lafan, the north-eastern point of the Katar promontory w ithiu Turkish jurisdiction. The pirates were alleged to have been aided by the inhabitants of Khor Shujeej, a village to the soutlTof Ras Lafan and about 20 miles north of Bidaa. 371. Mahomed-bin-Ibrahim A1 Chaarban, a diver and a subject of Bahrein was in command of the boat attacked. His story was that he and 14 other Bahrein subjects had finished their pearl-fishing on July 5th, and went to anchor in the evening in five fathoms water off Ras Haffan. Towards next mornins, Zaid-bin-Mahomed, his brother (Jand-bin-Mahomed) and ten others of the Beni Hajir in a Buggarah, together with some men of the A1 IMahondah, who lived at Khor Shujeej, in a small shoee attacked his boat, fired at them, killed one man and wounded three, and then plundered the boat. The pirates carried off two slaves and 2,026 krans worth of property. They then put themselves with some of his crew, mcluding the wounded, into a buggarah, and made cff with his boat.^ He met a friendly buggarah, and, having received assistance, pursued the pirates who landed near Rasoon Hasoa and escaped. He then recovered his boat, which was left on the shore and came to Bahrein, where he reported the occurrence, and the News Agent informed Colonel Ross.95 372. Colonel Ross telegraplied to Mr. Robertson at Basrah, who thereupon wrote strongly to Colonel Miles at Baghdad, and also to the Governor of Basrah, urging the necessity of prompt action. He also spoke to Commodore Ahmed Beg (of the Arkadi ?), who expressed his readiness to act at once, but Abdullah Pasha threw cold water on his zeal and forbade hasty action. In Mr. Robertson's opinion Abdullah Pasha had neither the iutention or capacity to stop these and similar outrages, which, he looked on 4 ' as the results of English artifice and intrigue,and it was well known that he hated the English. 373. In two later telegrams, dated the 18th and 22nd July, respectively. Colonel Miles reported that— f&lt; hehacl received a telegram from the Governor of Basmh saying that he (the Gove''nor) bad sent stringent orders to the authorities at Nejd and the Naval Officer for the capture of the offenders.' 374. In the second telegram Colonel Miles stated that he had received a despatch from the Ambassador at the Porte informing him that the Minister of Marine had telegraphed to enquire what measures were taken by the authorities at Basrah relative to piracies, and to ascertain whether the state of affairs was owing to negligence or to want of means of suppression. Also that two corvettes were being despatched to the Gulf. 375. Colonel Ross intended to request the Senior Naval Officer, who was at Bahrein, to investigate the guilt of the people of Khor Shujeej, on whom he thought Government should induce the Turks to inflict punishment should their guilt be established. 376. In reporting the matter to Secretary of State, the Government of India c x v -. q - to xt observed in their despatch No. 102 of the Pohucsl A„ SeplomW 1879, ho. 62 0. ^ Saptember ' While it is very desirable on general grounds that an understanding- should be speedily arrived at on the question dealt with in our despatch No. 127, dated k52nd May, it is necessary that in the meantime, pressure should be brought to bear on the local Turkish authorities whereby tbey may be induced either to adopt adequate measures of their own for the capture and punishment of Zaid-bin-Mahomed, or to acquiesce in the neetlful action being taken by the Resident in Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will perceive from the inclosures of this despatch that as long as Abdulla Pasha, whose shortcomings have been already brought to notice, remains at Basrah, the requisite measures are likely to be indefinitely postponed.' 377. The Resident's action in respect to Zaid-bin-Mahomed and the Beni Hajir was approved, but the Government of India disapproved of Colonel Ross' proposal that the Turkish Government should be called upon to inflict punish ment on the Khor Shujeej, inasmuch as they were unable to admit that Khor Shujeej and Ras Lafan were situated within acknowledged Turkish juris diction. 378. In October 1879 the Government of India reported to Her Majesty's Removal ot Abd„ii«h p..ba, &gt;,1.0 i, wcceedod by Secretary of State that Abdullah ir-asha had zabit Pasha. completely failed to give any satisfaction Political a., November 18/9, No. 138. for the piracies committed upon British vessels within Turkish waters, or any information with regard to the enquiries alleged to have been instituted by the Turkish authorities, and they noted with satisfaction that he had been removed from his post, and succeeded by Zabit Pasha as Governor-General of Basrah. 379. Meanwhile the piracies under Zaid-bin-Mahomed in July 1879, had RemonBtrance ad^rjssed to t hs Porte. been made the subject of a strong renions- foiiticai a , november 1879, ncs. 184-188. trance to the Porte, in which Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople observed that Her Majesty's Govern ment could not permit the continuance of state of things so detrimental to tha interests and commerce of Great Britain. 380. From subsequent correspondence with Colonel Ross it appeared that . ,v • • * oi. m ^ f irvi cvi ' the guilt or the A1 Mohandeli of Khor f Vftrmng piven to the Sheikli or Knor Shujeej. r . . . a . m PoUticHl a., November 1879, Nos. 286—291. Shujeej in these piracies Was not SUUl- ciently proved to warrant punitive measures. The Government of India, there-96 fore approved of the Resident's proposal to warn the Sheikh of Kbor Shujeej and 'other Sheikhs of Katar that great care and watchfulness should be exer cised while theBeni Hajir robbers were at large, as even though their boats were pressed by the Beni Hajir, as they stated was the case in this instance, it mi-ht be necessary to confiscate them, if employed for piratical purposes. 381. The new Governor-General of Basrah, Zabit Pasha, did not seem in clined to take any more active steps than Seal A?;November 1879. No. his predecessor for the punishment of Zaid bin-Mahomed, and the Political A-ent in Turkish Arabia was, therefore, ins tructed in November 1879 to urge upon him the necessity of moving in the matter. 382. The Political Agent accordingly addressed the Pasha on the sub ject, and pointed out that Zaid-bin-Maho- Polltical A., January 1880. No. 428. was ^ a nian 0 f an y standing, but that impunity had made him daring and success as a pirate had procured him a following. Where pressure put oh the Sheikhs of the Beni Hajir, they wouid, no doubt, readily capture and deliver him to the authorities. 383. In November 1879* Colonel Ross forwarded reports from the News- Removal of. ot the Aiba-Ko.arah from Ageot at Bahrein regarding the removal of Bidaa to Poweyrat. a section of the Albu Kowarah tribe irom • roiiticai a., december 1879. No. 592. Bidaa to Foweyrat a town on the north east of the promontory of Katar. They were said to be offended by some proceed- ings of the local Turkish authorities; the Turkish Governor-General of Hasa having sent an order that no one was to be allowed to settle between Obeyja and Odied'or anywhere on the coast of Katar, except at Bidaa. Should anyone so settle, a ship would be sent to destroy their settlement. 384. In the December followingf Captain Woodroffe, Senior Naval Officer Captain Woodruffe's cruise m the Gulf. in the Gulf, Was deputed to visit Various t Political a . February 1880, No 8i. places on the coast, and to deliver to the Sheikhs of Khor Sbujeej and Kater letters from Colonel Ross, warning them to be careful of becoming implicated in the piracies of the Beni Hajir. He obtained assurances from the Sheikhs that they would act in accordance with the wishes of the British Government. At the same time Captain Woodroffe made enquiries as to the cause of the removal of the Albu-Kowarah tribe from Bidaa to IWeyrat. Jasim-bin-Mahomed Thani of Bidaa accused the Sheikh of Bahrein of having instigated the tribe to leave Bidaa, and from the reports of the Native Agent at Bahrein it appeared that some of the elders of the tribe had gone to Bahrein, and had there received presents. 385. Colonel Ross was of opinion that the removal of Sheikh Mahomed bin Said, the chief of the tribe, arose from jealousy of Jasim-bin-Mahomed Thani who, as the nominee of the Turks, had obtained ascendancy at Bidaa, and he remarked that the secession had caused much irritation to Jassim and satisfaction to the Bahrein Sheikh. Colonel Ross also reported that he had written to Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, who was in charge of Bahrein during the absence of his brother, and warned him against interfering on the mainland. The Sheikh denied any interference, and promised to abide by the Resident's advice, and not to visit the mainland during his brother's absence. Zab .t Pasha agrain addressed. 386. In April 1880 Zahit Pasha was asrain political a., may 1880. nos. 163- ig 7. addressed regarding Zaid-bin-Mahomed, and replied that he had not been successful in effecting his capture. . ,cv ^ . t.

Zaid-bin Mahomed, and also alluded to re- mours of an intended attack on Bahrein by Nasir bin Mobarik, the Bahrein refugee. 388. Colonel Ross, therefore, considered the presence of one of Her Majes ty's vessels at Bahrein desirable as a matter of precaution.97 389 The Turkish authorities were addressed and sent sfrone and positive orders to the Mutasarriff of Nejd to enquire into the fresh cases of piracy. Political a., August 1880, No. 34. 390. The Government of India requested u r, tlie P^itical Agent, Turkish Arabia, to repoit the result of these orders. 391. On the 9th December the Eesident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed Nasir-bin• Mobarik'a attempt to attack Bahrein. that a body of Arabs Under Nasir bln-Mo- ' an ^ ar - v &lt; 1881, No * 47 - barik had assembled on the mainland op posite Bahrein, and were watching for an opportunity to attack the island. Pre parations were made for sending a vessel of war to the spot, but the raid failed owing to the want of boats. 392. The orders issued by the Vali of Baghdad to the Mutasarriff of Nejd, Political a., January 1881, Nos. 70-77. legarding the suppression of piracies had no effect whatever, and from subsequent correspondence with the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, and with the Resident in the Gulf, it appeared that the Turkish vessel Arkadi had not been en^a^ed on any duty connected with the arrest of Zaid-bin-Mahomed and other pirates, as alleged by the Turkish authorities. 393. In December 1880 Colonel Ross forwarded by post some further parti- Political A., January 1881, Nob. 141-157. culars of Nasir-biti-Mobarik's attempted . attack on Bahrein. The Arabs with him were said to belong to the Munasir, BeniHajir, and Al-Mnrrah tribes, and were about 600 in number. They assembled near Ruais and Abu'l Dhuloof, whence they intended to cross over to Bahrein, but were prevented by the inhabitants who refused to lend them their boats. 361. In January 1881 Colonel Ross forwarded copies of letters received Secret, June 1881, No. 10. from Nisir-bin-Mubarik and Sheikh . Jassim-bin-Mahomed Thani, Chief of Bidaa, written after the failure of the attack on Bahrein. Nasir-bin-Mobarik a?ked for the support and assistance of the British Government, and promised to act in accordance with their wishes. He also announced his intention of crossing over to Bahiein, as his family, friends, and property were there. Colonel Ross, in reply, informed him that any hostile descent on Bahrein by him or any other person would be opposed and punished. 395. Jassim-bin-Thani asked Colonel Ross to act as mediator to make up the quarrel between Nasir-bin Mobarik and Sheikh Esau, to which Colonel Ross replied that Nasir's right to property in Bahrein was not recognized, and that any allowance given him by the Bahrein Government would be, on condition of his abandoning his evil designs and selecting an approved residence, other than Katar. 396. From Nasir-bin-Mobarik's letter is seemed probable that he would before long renew his attack on Bahrein. 397. In March 1881 the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia forwarded a copy of a letter from the Vali of Baghdad^ in which he reported that he had ascertained from the Mutasarriff of Nejd that no piracy or plunder of vessels had been committed by Zaid-bin-Mahomed, and that perfect tranquillity and security prevailed on the Katar coast by sea and land. £98. From Colonel Ross' letters Nos. 25, 29 and 38 of the 19th and 26th Feb- jassim Din Mahomed, Governor of Bidaa. ruary and 11th March it appeared that Secret, June 1881, Nos. 15-24. since the failure of his raid Nasir-bin-Mo barik had been living in Turkish territeiry at Katar, and Colonel Ross had held Jassim-bin-Mahomed, the Governor of Bidaa, responsible for his conduct. Jassim, however, in the Resident's opinion had been all the time secretly assist ing Nasir in his projects for recovering his possessions in Bahrein, and had recently attempted to ^et rid of his responsibility on the ground that Nasir had left his jurisdiction, and was supported by Bedouin Arabs. The Resident, how ever, informed Jasim that he must still hold him responsible for the conduct of [C967FD]98 Nasir -bin-Mobarik so long as he was on the Katar coast. Colonel Ross also thought it advisable that the Turkish Governor and authorities should be informed of Nasir's designs with a view to having his proceedings watched, and he recommended that Jassim should be warned that any hostile movement on the part of Nasir would be attributed to him. With this view be forwarded copies of the papers to the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, for any action he might think fit. 399. In subsequent letters of the 2nd and 9th April 1881, Colonel Boss reported that Nasir-bin Mobarik received Secret, June 1881, Nos. 27 and 81. ^ allowailce of 60 dollars mon thly from the Turkish Government, and that he himself asserted that he was encouraged in designs against Bahrein by promises of support in the event of his succeeding in gaining a footing on the island. Nasir who had on previous occasions been invited to visit Colonel Ross at Bushire, had replied that he feared his doing so would give umbrage to the Turkish authorities, and that his allowance would be stopped. He proposed, however,.to send to Bushire his cousin, Ali-bin-Nasir who had lately been released from Aden, and Colonel Ross saw no objection to this. Colonel Boss also forwarded a letter from Jassim, who persisted in deny ing that he was in any way responsible for Nasir's conduct. 400. On the receipt of Colonel Ross'letters on this subject, the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia made enquiries from the secret, June issi, No. 34. y a ^ o £ regarding Nasir-bin- Mobarik's movements on the Katar coast. The Vali replied that, after enquiry from the Turkish authorities on that coast, her found that nothing had been done by Nasir-bin Mobarik to justify any alarm on the part of the people or Sheikh of Bahrein. The Political Agent considered that this statement, which was so inconsistent with the state of affairs reported by Colonel Ross, was due to anxiety on the part of the Turkish oflQcers to minimize the danger, lest they should be called upon to take effective measures to guard against it. Pend ing instructions from the Government of India he did not think it advisable to make any further representation to the Turkish authorities, as had been suggested by Colonel Ross, as no practical results were likely to follow from any such communication. If Jasim and Nasir-bin-Mobarik disregarded the warning con veyed to them by Colonel Ross, he advised that they should be dealt with under the orders of the Resident in the Persian Gulf in such manner as the circum stances of the case might seem to require. The effect of such procedure, he considered, would not only be decisive as regards the two individuals named, but would greatly simplify our future course of action in the Gulf, and although the proceedings of the Resident would probably elicit from the Turkish Govern ment a demand for explanation, it would not be very difficult to prepare an ade quate answer to any reclamations which might be put forward. 401. The orders of the Government of India on the subject were conveyed c f T n.issi or.q7 111 their telegrams of the 7th May 1881 to ecre &gt; u ' • * the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia. The former was authorized to warn Jasim-bin- Mahomed that if he was in any way accessory to an attack on Bahrein, he would be held directly responsible. If the attack were made, the Resident was directed to report to the Government of India, and meanwhile he was requested to ascertain and report whether there was any Turkish force or sign of Turkish authority at • S.crei,j«n e i88i. No. 39. Bidaa. Colonel Eoss replied * tbat there was a Turkish guard, about 130 strong at El-Bidaa, and that the Turkish flag was hoisted on the fort in which the guard was. 402. The instructions sent to the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, were that he should intimate formally to the Turkish authorities that, unless they could undertake to prevent and punish any attack on Bahrein from that part of the coast over which they claimed jurisdiction, the Government of India would be compelled, in the event of measures becoming necessary to protect Bahrein, or to redress injuries, to take the matter into their own hands.99 403. la reporting the matter to Her Majesty's Secretary of State the Government of India observed— ' The disposal of this case is^ to a certain extent embarssed by the fact that tb e Turks have laid some kind of claim to jurisdiction at Bidaa^ and at other points on th e Katr coast, whence Nasir bin Mobarik is believed to be mediating- a decent on Bahr in ; and it has been ascertained that there are some 130 Turkish soldiers in Bidaa itself. Direct dealings with the Bidaa Sheikh may possibly, therefore, bring about a remonstrance from the Turkish authorities. 8 Under these circumstances, we have given the matter very careful consideration before the issue of orders. But the result of this consideration has been to convince us that, having regard to tbe necessity of defending Bahrein, which is under British protection, and to the veiws of Her Majesty's Government regarding the recognition of Turkish juris diction on these coasts as announced in Lord Salisbury's despatch to Sir H. Layard of the 5th January 1880, we should, in the event of an expedition against the island being under taken from the neighbourhood, not be justified in allowing vague claims of territorial rio-hts— if unsupported by any practical attempt lo discharge the correlative duties which such^rights necessarily imply—to prevent us from taking measures to coerce both Nasir-bin Mobarikand the Bidaa Chief. At the same time it ssemed to us proper that every opportunity should be afforded to the Turks of using whatever authority they may possess, and may be willing to exert, upon this part of the coast. We have accordingly issued to the Political Agent, # 7th. Baghdad, and the Kesident, Persian Gulf, the telegrams of the 9th* May which form an en closure to this despatch, and we trust that our action in the matter may meet with the ap proval and support of Her Majesty's Government.'100 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (III).—Turkish Responsibilities and jurisdiction for the purpose of suppressing piracies in Katif waters- 1878-1881. 401. Eeference has been made already to the question of Turkish juris- c * *3 t* u iq-tq 'Kr o ii diction on the Katif and Katar coasts Secret E., December 1878, Nos. 2-11. „ ., „ ... ior the purpose ot suppressing piracies recently committed on Bahrein waters. The question was raised in the Secre tary of State's despatch No. 42, dated 17th October 1878, and the opinion of the Government of India invUed on the point. This involved the question of the demarcation of the Turkish sphere of territorial jurisdiction on that coast and the nature of the responsibility for order which should be held to devolve on the two Governments. On these pointi an expression of Colonel Ross* opinion was called for in Poreign Department No. 253 C.P., dated 17th De cember 1878. Colonel Nixon, also the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, was Resident, Bushire'aNo. 30. dated soth t old in a letter of the same date, that the 1879. Government of India would be glad to 1879 ^ TurklSh Arabia ' No '^ dated 12tllJanuary receive any statement of his views which he might desire to submit. The replies received from both officers, are summarised below :—• 405. Colonel Ross found the same difficulty which troubled the Govern ment of India (see paragraph 349 above) in understanding the precise character of the reference made by Colonel Nixon to the British Ambassador at Cons tantinople. He points out that we had not been engaged in any disputes with the tribes of JIasa ; that interference in their inter-tribal affairs had been avoided ; and that every effort had been made to hold the Turks responsible for disorder in Turkish districts. He then observed that if Colonel JNixon in writing of El.Hasa has intended to include Katar, a mistake had been made. The Turks have subjugated El-Hasa, and their military occupation of that province had involved the establishment of their authority at Katif and Ojair. In Katar, however, their authority was acquired at a later period and in a different manner, viz., by the invitation of the local chiefs of Bidaa ; and with the exception of Bidaa and the immediate neighbourhood, no steps have hitherto been taken to establish Turkish authority on the Katar coast. Strictly speaking, therefore, the continuity of the Turkish authority terminates at some point near Ojair, and from this point to El-Bidaa there is a tract where their supremacy has not been established, and which includes the peninsula on which Zobarah is situate and which is headed by Ras Reccan. But havino- explained this distinction. Colonel Ross goes on to say that the Turkish Government might with some reason argue that' their present actual position on this coast does involve, constructively, domination over the entire tract lying between Ojair and Bidaa, provided, of course, that no British rights or obligations exist with reference to this particular tract' of a nature to constitute an obligation to oppose the full establishment of Turkish authority therein.' The conclusions at which he arrived were— ' (1) That failing the exercise of British interference there is no obstacle in the way of completion of the chain of Turkish occupation of El-Katr as far as El- Bidaa. ' (2) That the British Government is not bound by any existing engao-ements to oppose that proceeding. ' (3) That assuming that the British Government see no sufficient ground for re- assuming the supervision and control over the portion of coast in question it would be best that the Turkish Government should undertake the responsibility and take effectual measures to maintain good order. ' But there is a point, of course, beyond which it would be jrnpnssible, consistently with the due maintenance of British rights and performance of our duties, to permit the further m 1101 extension of Turkleli rule or influence. This line sliould, it appears to me, be drawn nofc far from El-Bidaa, the furthest point on the coast, to which the operations of that Government have extended. The adjacent township of El-Wukran should, I consider, be rendered as accompanying El-Bidaa, and so included in the zone of allowable Turkish influence. The southern boundary of these districts might be conveniently drawn at the 25th degree of north latitude.' 406. Colonel Ross noticed that a difficulty will probably arise in respect to the Turkish pretensions to Arabia generally, but nevertheless advises that the Turkish Government should be invited ' to state the exact extent of the Ara bian coast for which they are prepared to accept responsibility and make effi cient arrangements for the maintenance of order and prevention of maritime irregularities, the British Government at the same time stating beforehand plainly the nature and extent of British paramount influence in the same coast, and the line beyond which this will be maintained. The islands of Bahrein w r ould, of course, be so reserved as w r ell as the entire * trucial region ' including Odied.' 407. The next question was what action should be taken by the British Government in case of the maritime peace of the Gulf being broken by expe ditions proceeding from acknowledged Turkish ports, and which the Turkish authorities were unable or unwilling to put down. Colonel Boss considered it 1 highly necessary to reserve the right to suppress by means of our naval force such irregular operations undertaken for marauding purposes in the high sea.' 408. On the very important question of the effect which the recognition of Turkish rights and obligations will have upon the British and Persian Govern ments Colonel Ross wrote :— ' There can be no doubt the appearence of the Turks in the Persian Gulf and their acquisitions somewhat curtailed the sphere of British control and limited our influence corres pondingly. But practically this was unavoidable ; and as we have already for some years abstained from the exercise of active control over that portion of the coast aetuallyj or poten tially, under Turkish rule or influence, the transfer of so much of our jurisdiction may be rpparded as an accomplished fact. It having been apparent to all, from the outset, that the British Government did not mean to oppose Turkish progress, where our own interests were not materially concerned, I do not think that full recognition of Turkish rights and obliga tions now would injuriously affect British influence and prestige as regards our own reserved pphere. Again, were a clear understanding arrived at, as suggested, and it being plain to the Turkish Government that no naval interference would be tolerated where we exercise authority and influence, there would be little inducement for the Turks to increase their naval force in the Gulf unduly, and the British naval force will remain as at present paramount. As re gards Persia, its Government and coast authorities have become accustomed to the presence of British ships-of-war, and recognise the advantage accruing therefrom. They would certainly resent any attempt of the Turks to assume a similar footing, but I do not think the latter would see any inducement to do so.' 409. The reply of the Government of India, Despatch No. 127, dated 22nd May 1879, was :— As to territorial jurisdiction along the coast, we would admit and recognize it herever it now practically exists. The sea line of the EL Eassa district, as far south-east as ' Ojair, ts apparently under some Und of established Turkish authority; and ths may he recognized hy accepting, with reservations to he explained presently, an understanding that the Turks desire to ht held responsible for maritime disorders on that coast. But we shou d be averse to enter into any discussions which might appear tp countenance claims by the Turkish Government to recognition of its authority beyond Ojair, or upon any part ot the coast of the El Katr promontory, except at El Bidda, where the lurks appear to liave jome real influence and representation. Beyond El Bidda and Wakra the Turks are not known to Lave any sort of authority; and near this point begin the _ territories of the Arab Chiets wo are under treaty with the British Government for the maintenance of P^ c 5 T aD ^ traint of piracv. We entirely agree with Colonel Ross that the intrusion o ur \ c ^ du g or influence within the territory of these maritime tribes would be inconbib an which observanceof British rights and obligations, and would be likely to derange a system whic has been most beneficial to the interests of all nations in the Gulf. 15. We may add that it will be essential, with regard to these Treaty Chiefs.to stipu late that not only shall they be free from interference m their sea ^ mainland also their boundaries must be respected, so far ast e * rm ^ 0 Government to known and can be varified. For otherwise it might be easy for the Ottoman Governme N 1R «r/, [C967FD] a L102 bring pressure upon tliese chiefs from the land side ; and they might thus find themselves subject to a divided or double authority, which would produce confusion, would create factions, and would tempt them to hoist the Turkish or the maritime treaty flag as might be most convenient at the moment. This possibility is illustrated by the proceedings of the Sheikh of El Bidda, who now declares himself subordinate to Turkey, and by the attempt of the Odied Sheikh to follow the example of El Bidaa/' It may, also, be necessary to protect the islands of Bahrein by special arrangements which should provide— i.—For the maintenance of the territories of the Chief of Bahrein under the protection of Great Britain. ii.—.For the fulfilment by the Chief of his treaty obligations including abstention from all interference with the mainland. But in the event of attack upon his territories the Chief, acting under the sanction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, should be permitted to take such defensive measures as may be necessary, even to the extent of following up his assailants into Turkish jurisdiction. The justification for this last provision lies in the peculiar situation of Bahrein. The islands are so near the mainland as to render them peculiarly liable to piratical attacks, while this same proximity affords the aggressors every facility for rapid escape into Turkish jurisdiction. 16. Secondly in regard to Ottoman responsibility for order ? Beyond the limits of ac knowledged Ottoman jurisdiction, no such responsibility would, as a matter of coarse, exist. But for the reasons already stated, we consider that within these limits the British Govern ment must continue to exercise some concurrent maritime protectorate ; at least until we can be better assured than at present that the Turkish Government can protect our subjects and our interests effectively. It may not be found necessary to place on record any formal agreement as to the exercise of this joint protectorate ; but some understanding of the following nature might be arraged i.—-That pirates, whatever their nationality, taken at sea, as well as pirates followed up and taken within the territorial waters of Turkey by British officers, or on shore within reach of the guns of British vessels, shall be dealt with under the orders of the Resident in the Persian Gulf.* ii.—That the British authorities shall not undertake operations on the mainland within the Turkish line, as the duty of destroying pirate strongholds so situated will devolve upon the Turkish authorities. iii.—That the necessary representations to the local Turkish authorities shall be ordi narily made by the Political Agent at Baghdad. If, however, immediate action is necessary, they may be made in the first instance by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who should inform the Political Agent at Baghdad of his pro ceedings. iv.—That in case of piracies committad from within their jurisdiction, the Trrkish authorities shall enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of com pensation. 17. It may also appear to Her Majesty's Government that the present opportunity should be taken to reviss our agreements both with Muscat and the Arab Trucial Chiefs including, of course, Bahrein. It is due to the policy which the British Government has persued for many years at heavy expense, and to the efficient naval police which it maintains, that piratical out rages have ceased on all that part of the Arab coast subject to British influence. In conse quence of this condition of permanent security, the commerce of the Persian Gulf has deve loped to an extent which a few years ago would have been dpemed impossible, and it continues steadily to increase. The Arab Chiefs and the Sultan of Muskat have prospered under the prolonged and settled peace which the British maritime protectorate has secured. Neverthe less, they contribute nothing towards the maintenance of a condition of thing so profitable to themselves, and their engagements contain no distinct acknowledgment of the British Gov ernment as the paramount power. The Government of India has never exercised any right of sovereignty over these Chiefs, nor, except as regards maritime proceedings, does it possess any control over them. For the purpose of obtaining a complete and recognized title, and of securing on a valid international basis the position which the British Government has ac quired by a long coarse of settled polioy. and at much cost, it will be very advisable to arrange that the Treaty Chiefs shall render a small tribute to us in exchange for our protection. 18. The question of the effect which a settlement with Turkey is likely to produce upon Persia, scarcely falls within the province of the Government of India. Colonel Ross remarks that the Persian Government and its authorities along the coast have become accustomed to the presence of British ships-of-war, and appreciate the advantages of our operations. He adds that Persia would certainly resent any attempts on the part of Turkey to assume a similar P' si'ion ; nor does he think that the Turks would think it worth while to make the attempt. We may however observe that a determination, somewhat on the lines indicated, of the posi-103 tion to be occupied henceforward by the Turkish Government in these regions, would not be prejudicial to Persian interests. As long as the limits of Turkish authority remain undefined, plausible arguments may be advanced for strengthening the Turkish squadron on duty in the Gulf. An increase in the number of Turkish vessels' in these waters would add appreciably to the Turkish power of aggression against Persia, at a point where the Shah's capabilities of resistance are specially feeble. When once those limits have been settled, there would be less excuse for an indefinite increase to the Turkish fleet in the Gulf, such as, for instance, was contemplated in 1871. In this view, therefore, the proposed settlement would be of advantage to Persia. 19. Colonel Ross anticipates that the claims of the Turkish Government to the suzer ainty of the whole of Arabia will hinder the proposed settlement of the limits of Turkish authority. In former days the Turks have asserted that Nejd is a Turkish province, that the Wahabee Amir is aTurkish official, and that Bahrein, Abuthabi, Debaye, and other towns on the coast are included in Nejd territory. We do not think that these pretensions would necessarily be revived by a discussion of the question of litteral jurisdiction; but if, they should be put forward, we presume that they would be negatived by Her Majesty's Government as firmly and conclusively as the Turkish claim to Bahrein has been already negatived. 20. There remains the question of the procedure to be followed by the Resident at Bushire, and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia in the transaction of business in which the Turkish authorities are concerned. There is no doubt that the Resident in the Persian Gulf should keep the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia fully informed of proceedings which involve a reference to Turkish officials. In such matters, it is essential that there should exist between the British Agents constant and confidential intercourse. The difficulty is ibo deter mine by rule at what point the conduct of correspondence should pass from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. Generally speaking, all matters relating to Turkish jurisdiction or responsibilities should be transferred to the Baghdad Agency as soon as possible, though on emergency the Bushire Resident would, in the first place, address the Turkish authorities direct. The same rule applies mutatis mutandis to correspondence between the Political Agent at Baghdad and the Persian authorities in'Khuzistan, For the rest, a great deal must be left to the discretion and experience of the officers concerned, and to their joint action; and in this sense it might be advisable to issue some general instructions to the two Agencies. 410. The question of the suppression of piracy in the Persian Gulf was No. 55, Political, dated 22nd May 1879. already under consideration when the » 77 ' ' ' 23rd June » despatch from which the extracts cited are taken reached the India Office. A copy of it and the other letters noted in the margin were forwarded to the foreign Office in Sir L. Mallet's letter, dated 1st August, with the following remarks :— ' Lord Cranbrook is disposed to concur generally in the views set forth in the Government of India letter No. 127 of the 22nd May last, more particularly as regards the expediency of defining the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction on tha coast of the Persian Gulf will be recognized. So many important questions are however involved that His Lordship prefers to delay expressing any positive opinion, until he has been able to consider more fully all the correspond ence connected with the subject/' 411. The Foreign Office replied in Sir Julian Pauncefote's letter, dated 23rd August. This dealt first with the subject-matter of the despatches from the Government of India, No. 55, dated 22nd May, and No. 77, dated 23rd June, cited above, and intimated the action which Lord Salisbury proposed to take in respect to them. It then explained the position of the Odeid affair, and concluded with the following expression of Lord Salisbury's view 7 son the question of Turkish jurisdiction :— &gt; I ' Upon these proposals Lord Salisbury will be glad to receive the further observations from Lord Cranbrook promised in your letter. It appears to Lord Salisbury, however, at first sight that the arrangement to which it is desired by the Government of India that the Turkish Government should be brought to consent, is one which would, no doubt, be convenient in view of British interests, but which offers few or no corresponding advantages to Turkey. The Porte is apparently expected to agree to a definition of its authority along the coast, as not in any way extending beyond the neighbourhood of El-Bidaa. It would be called upon to abandon the claim, which, though practically rejected by Her Majesty's Government, it has never itself in terms renounced, to sovereignty over Bahrein, to acknowledge that island as independent under British protection ; and further, to concede to the Chief, in the event of attacks upon his territories, the right of taking such defensive measures as may be necessary, under the sanction of the British Resident at Bushire, even to the extent of following up his j i10 i assailants into Turkish jurisdiction. It is moreover, proposed that until we are assured that the Turiksh Government can effectively protect our aubjpcts and interests. British cruisers should evercise the right to pursue and capture pirates within Turkish territorial waters or on shore within reach of their guns : captures so made to be dealt with under the orders of the British Ees'dent in the Persian Gulf. To the Turkish authorities would be left the exclusive conduct of anv operations that may be requisite on the mainland, and the care of enforcing restitution and compensation in case of piracies committed from within their jurisdiction. &lt;1 0 V &gt;ject in view, viz., the repression of piracy and the maintenance of an efficient maritime police in the Gulf, is one in which this country takes considerable interest, but to which the Turkish Government are admitted to be very indifferent. Lord Salisbury therefore fails to see what are the inducements which would lead a Government inclined to be _ jealous of foreign interferencej and singularly indisposed to renounce claims of sovereignty or jurisdiction however shadowy, to give an explicit consent to the principles above set forth. «It would seem more practical and more in accordance with usaire that, having settled for oursplves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction may be admitted, and beyond which it should be rejected or opposed, we should, as a general rule, look to the Turkish^ authorities to exercise a proper police in those limits, only sanctioning the action of Biitish ciuisnrs in Turkish territorial waters under special circumstances when the consent &lt; f the local authorities has been obtained. The measures adopted by the Porte have undoubtedly been as yet insuffi cient and ineffectual, but further exertions and fresh naval reinforcements have been promised. Until the result of these has been seen, there scarcely exists sufficient ground for a general proposal of joint police in Turkish waters without any reciprocal concession to Turkish cruisers. 'The Government of India make a further proposal which, as Lord Salisbury understands it, is to the effect that the Trucial Chiefs on the coast, who have hitherto been independent under certain treaty obligations to this country, and the Chief of Bahrein also, who is in a somewhat similar position, should, for the future, become tributary dependents of Great Britain. It is further suggested that our relations with Maskat should undergo revision, but whether in the same sense is not positively stated. 'These are proposal which, in Lord Salisbury's opinion, should not be entertained with out very serious consideration. As regards Maskat, Lord Cranbrook is, no doubt, aware that this country is under an engagement with France (dated March lOth 1S82) to respect the independence of the Sultan. The sovereignty of Bahrein has long formed the subject of claims advanced by Turkey and Persia. These cdaims have always been repudiated by Her Majesty's Government, but such a step as is now suggested would doubtless lead to renewed controversy, and give rise to suspicion and ill-feeling on the part of both these powers. It may be true that the extension of Turkish authority along the coast will be attended with inconvenience and disadvantage to British commerce, and that the present position of the Trucial Chiefs does not offer the same facilities for opposing such an extension as a more definite dependence on Great Biitain. But the acquisition and maintenance of British sovereignty over this strip of territory on the coast of Arabia is not unlikely to give rise to questions equally inconvenient. 412. In Sir L. Mallet's letters, dated 6th September and 7tli October, the No. 77, dated 23rd June, Nos. 102 and 104, dated despatches noted in the margin were for- ut September 1878. warded to the Foreign Office, and even tually in Sir L. Mallet's letter, dated 17tb September, already cited, the Secre tary of State for India gave the following opinion on the general question:— « There can, in Lord Cranbrnok's opinion, be little doubt that the present disturbed state of the Arab coast and ths seas adjacent is, in a great measure, a consequence (1) of the obstacles to direct action on the part of the British authorities in the Gulf, which are inter posed by the position assumed on the Arab coast by the Turkish Government since the Nejd expedition of 1871-7^ ; (2) of the uncertain nature of that position ; and (3) of the practical inabi ity of the Ottoman officials to maintain order even along that part of the coast where Turkish influence is strongest. 'This being so, it appears to Lord Cranbrook to be important to determine, as speedily as possible, with whom shall rest responsibility for order along the coast, whether with the Government of India alone, or with the Porte alone, or with the two Governments conjointly. ' His Lordship has considered with attention the views of Lord Lytton's Government on this point, expressed in their despatch No. 127, dated the 22nd May last, and also those of Lord Salisbury, as set forth in Sir J. Pauncefote's letter of the 23rd August. 'The Government of India recommend that from Bussorah to Ojair the authority of the Porte should be recognized as established on land, but that at sea the Bri ish Goverament should continue to exercise some concurrent protectorate, pursuing pirates, if necessary, into Turkish waters, and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits, through the Resident in the Gulf; that south or east of Ojair, Turkish author ity should not be recognized except at El Bidaa on the Guttur peninsula; a^d that the Porte should be required {a) to stipulate not to interfere, either on tae coast or inland, with the105 Tmcral Chiefs between Odied and Ras-el Khyma; (J) to recognize the territories of the Sheiks of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain; and (c) in case of piracies from within it jurisdiction, to enforce restitution of plundered property, aud payment of compensation. ' Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs observes, with reference to these proposals, that in the absence of inducements the Porte is not likely to assent to the suggested limitations of its sovereignty or jurisdiction, or to independent action of another power in territory or waters admitted to the Turkish. Lord Salisbury, therefore, suggests that it would be more practical, and more in accordance with usage, that having settled for ourselves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction may be exercised, and beyond which it whould be rejected or opposed, we should, as a general rule, look to the Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police in those limits, only sanctioning the action of British cruisers in Turkish waters under special circumstances, when the consent of the local authorities has been obtained. 'The principal objection to the course recommended by the Govdhment of India appears to Lord Cranbrook to be that it involves a previous understanding with the Porte which His Lordship agrees with Lord Salisbury in thinking scarcely possible of attainment Apart from the notorious difficulty of negotiation with the Turkish Government upon any subject, the past correspondence in reference to Nejd and Bahrein indicates that upon this particular question that Government is likely to be found specially impracticable, and that it is hopeless to expect that the Porte could be induced to record, in even the most informal diplomatic document, its assent either to limitation of its authority in Arabia or to anything like a joint maritime protectorate with the British Government along any part of the coast, and, still less, to an exclusive British protectorate over Bahrein. ' It must further, from past experience, be regarded as very improbable that any under taking on the part of the Turkish Government to enforce from third parties restoration of plundered property and payment of compensation would be operative in practice. On this point, the complete absence of result from the representations made at Constantinople in 1876 and 1877, in reference to the cases of the British Indian subjects, Cheyla and Rama, and the attack on an Abuthabi boat in the harbour of El Bidaa, are significant. ' Lord Cranbrook, on the other hand, fears that the course suggested in Sir J. Pauncefote's letter of the /i3rd August, while it would probably be little less distasteful to the Porte than that proposed by the Government of India, would fail to attain the object in view. ' If adopted, the authority and responsibility of the Turkish Government would be recog nized as complete within certain territorial limits to be fixed by ourselves, and would be wholly disallowed beyond these limits. ' The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it ii to he defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at ant/point north of Ojair, which is opposite the southern extremity of the island of Bahrein ; but it is precisely between that spot and Kateef that, since the settlement of the Beni Yas at Odeid was broken up in 1878, the operations of the piratical tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity. Upon this point Lord Cranbrook would invite Lord Salisbury's attention to Colonel Ross^ letter of the SthMay, enclosed in Government of India's despatch No. 91 of the 28th July last, which was communicated to the Foreign Office on the (Hh instant. ' His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognising any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish, and as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would be the formation of an asylum which would be taken advantage of by marauders in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would he unable to control without a contiderable and permanent increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf which the Torte had declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense } and which would be open to many objections on poltti' cal grounds. 'The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cranbrook is led is that negotiation or discussion with the Torte on the territorial question should he avoided • but that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce may be efficiently fulfilled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by individual Chiefs, such as the Sheikh of £1-Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points. ' It seems to Lord Cranbrook that Her Majesty's Government have a right to regard the fact of particular ports being used as bates for piratical attacks, and certain tribes being en gaged in those attacks, as prima facie evidence that such ports and such tribes are not un er the effective control of the Ottoman Government, and that they would be justified in issuing instructions to their officers in accordance with this view. « Lord Cranbrook is further of opinion that, having regard to the repeated assurances given by the Turkish Government in (871-72, at the time of the operations in Nejd, that no interference with the littoral tribes was intended, and to the as often repeated declaration ot [C967rD]106 tbe British Government that it would object to any disfnrbance of the tiaiut jao as regards those tribes, Her Majegty^s Government might, if it were deemed expedient, legitituatel y decline to recognize any part of the coast south ef Koweit as subject to Turkey, even if Ottoman authority were established there much more firmly than is really the case. ' Provided, however, that no obstacles be interposed to any operations which may b« necessary to preserve the peace of the seas and to punish marauders, and that no interfereoce is attempted either with Bahrein or the Trucial Chiefs from Odeid to Ras-el-Khyma, or with Maskat, Lord Cranbrook does not consider that exception need be taken to the proceedings of the Turks at any point of the coast north of Odeid. In expressing this opinion, His Lordship does not forget that the Government of India mould restrain the Porte from extending it» influence beyond Ojair •, but, subject to the condi tions above stated, Lord Cranbrook aoes not see any sufficient reason for objecting to the establishment of such relations between the Turkish authorities in El-Hassa and the tribes of the Guttur peninsula to the north of Odeid, as may be agreeable to the parties concerned. It will have been gathered from the foregoing remarks that, in Lord Cranbrook's opinion, it is essential to the restoration and maintenance of order in the Persian Gulf, that no merely nominal extension of Turkish authority should be permitted to hamper tbe action of the officers of the British Government, and that His Lordship would desire a return, as far aff possible, to the system followed until within the last few years, under which the Resident at Bushire, and the British Naval authorities acting under his orders dealt directly with the Arab; tribes along the entire littoral, captured piratical craft wherever they might be found, and ex acted from tha local Sheikhs redress for outrages committed by their people. Under instructions which were issued by the Admiralty in the month of May last, the: Commanders of Her Majesty^s ships in the Gulf are prohibited from hostile action within Turkish territory or its waters, without the consent or co-operation of the Turkish authorities. Lord Cranbrook would suggest that these instructions should be modified, and that naval officers should be authorized, when so directed by the Resident in the Gulf, to act in any particular case in such wise as may be necessary for the capture and punishment of marauders, collision with Turkish cruisers or troops being, of course, scrupulously avoided. If, upon further consideration, Lord Salisbury should be prepared to acquiesce in the. policy above suggested, it might, Lord Cranbrook thinks, be left to the discretion of Her Majesty's Ambassador art Constantinople, either to intimate to theiEorte at-once the determina tion of Her Majest/s Government, or to await a remonstrance against; the. action of : thfr British authorities in some particular case. The pretensions, however, which Abdulla Pasha the Governor-General of Bnpgorah, has lately asserted, to regard all ports in Southern and Eastern Arabia^ including Bahrein- and Maskat as Turkish should, in Lord Cranbrook's opinion, be distinctly negatived and the oppor tunity might, perhaps, be taken of . intimating plainly to the-,Porte that, so far as Eastern. Arabia is concerned, to whatever extent Turkish supremacy may eventually be admitted by the littoral tribes north of Odied, Her IVlajesty ; s Government will not recognize its extenaion over either the Trucial Chiefs, or the Sultan of Muscat. I am, in conclusion, directed to state that Lord Cranbrook concurs in the view which Lord Salisbury takes of the proposal for a revision of treaty relations between the British Govemment and Sheikh of Bahrein, the Tmcial Chiefs and the Ruler of Maskat, which is contained in the India letter of 5i2nd May last, It does not seem to Lord Cranbrook that closer connection with those Arab potentates is necessary or expedient in British interests, or that any object, which cannot otherwise be obtained, would be gained by exacting from them tribute or any other formal recognition of British supremacy. The policy of the Indian Government has always been to abstain from interference in the disputes and conflicts of the Arab tribes on land, and a departure from that policy, to which closer relations might very well lead, would almost certainly result in embarrassment. ' Lord Cranbrook will reply to the Government of India in the above sense, so soon as he may be favored with Lord Salisbury's views on the main question which is the subjeofc- of this letter.' 413. The three different proposals as to the manner in which Turkish juris diction in the Persian Gulf should he dealt with may be summarized ia^ follow:-^ i.—The Government of India recommended the recognition of Turkish jurisdiction within certain specified limits, subject to the admission of British concurrent jurisdiction by sea, under certain Ldefined contingencies. And they are averse from any further extension of Turkish authority. ii.—The English Foreign Office opposed the estabiishment of concurrent jurisdiction or a joint police, and advise the recognition of Turkish authority t107 within limits to be settled by tbe British Government, and its absolute repudi ation beyond those limits. Ordinarily, the Turks should be held reponsible for the maintenance of a proper police within their own jurisdiction, but British operations in Turkish territorial waters would he permissible in special feases with the previous consent of the local authorities. iii.~-The India Office was against any definition of the limits of Turkish jurisdiction. Mere pretensions to sovereignty on the part of the Turks should not be allowed to hamper British action. But where Turkish authority has been, or may hereafter be, effectually established in any part of the coast north of Odeid—the islands of Bahrein being excepted—it must be recognized. Purther, provided that no obstacles were interposed to any operations which might be necessary to preserve the peace of the seas and to punish marauders, and that no interference was attempted either with Bahrein or the Trucial Chiefs from Odeid to Has-el-Khyma or with Maskat, the Turks may be left to establish Ottoman authority as far south as Odeid. The proposals of the Government of India differed essentially from those of the Eoreigfl Office, in that the latter would ordinarily not permit British operations within Turkish jurisdiction. The practical effect of this difference would be found to depend upon the extent of the territorial limits within which the Foreign Office must be prepared to recognize the existence of estab lished Turkish^ authority. The Foreign Office did not absolutely reject'the Indian idea of a joint police. There is an apparent inclination to give the Turks another trial,, and to wait the result of the renewed and more vigor ous measures which they have promised to initiate. 414. The views of the Inflia Office, it will be seen, had undergone a com plete change. In Sir' L. Mallet's letter, dated 1st August^ Lord Cranbrook concurred generally in the proposals of the Government of India, more especi ally in the suggested definition of the limfts of Turkish authority. In Sir L. Mallet's subsequent letter the inexpediency of any such definition constitutes the distinctive feature of Lord Cranbrook's policy, and special stress is laid Upon it. 415. Another point to notice was the suggestion made by Lord Cranbrook in respect to the instructions to be issued for the guidance of naval officers in the Gulfi 416. In March 1879 Colonel Boss wrote to Captain Wodehouse, Com manding Her Majesty's Ship Teas£er\ intimating that the Government of India had accorded their sanction and approval to naval action against pirates along that portion of the Turkish Arabian coast, of late infested by robber bands, whether within or beyond Turkish territorial waters, to the extent of thorough examination of the coast referred to, recovery of Bahrein vessels stolen by the Bedouins, and removal beyond their reach of boats likely to be seized and used for further depredations. 417. Ther^ sanction was : given on the condition that the naval officers and the Kesident in the Gulf were in accord on the subject, and on the under standing that no expedition would be undertaken on the mainland, subject to Turkish authority beyond the reach of the guns of Her Majesty's ships. 418^ Captain Wodehouse referred these instructions to the Naval Com- mander -in-Clnef^ and in due course they were submitted by the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, with an enquiry whether it was the desire of Her Majesty's Government that the course directed by the Indian Government should be adopted. Lord Salisbury felt a difficulty iii the absence of further explana tions in expressing concurrence in the measures proposed. He apprehended that in the absence of treaty stipulations, Her Majesty's ships could only deal ^with piracy jure gentium, that is piracy committed in the high seas beyond the territorial waters of Turkey,' and that any expeditions by them on the mainland, although within reach of the guns of Her Majesty's ships*108 T 4 miglit be the subject of just remonfltranoe on the part of the Turkish Government. In • Telegram dated 20th Mav answer to the Secretary of State's call* for a full Telegram, dated 20th May. re port, the Government of India referred to their despatch of the 22nd May, and, pending further instructions, the Admiralty desired the officers in command of Her Majesty's ships in the Gulf to take no hostile action within Turkish terri tory or its waters without the consent or co-operation of the Turkish authorities. 419. It was observed in paragraph 4 of this note that Sir J. Pauncefote's letter, dated 23rd August, dealt also with the subject-matter of two despatches from the Government of India, Nos, 55 and 77, dated, respectively, 22nd May and 23rd June. 420. Sir J. Pauncefote intimated that copies of these two despatches would be sent to Sir H. Layard, who would be authorized to use his discretion as to making further representation to the Porte, either with regard to the surrender of Bahrein subjects implicated in the recent raid upon that island, or respecting the expediency of obtaining compensation for those of the sufferers from the various depredations recorded in whom the British Government were interested. Sir H. Layard, it appears, had already supported the application made by Colonel JSixon on the former of these two points in a note verbale, &lt; a copy of which has not been communicated to the Government of India. 421. In a later letter, dated 22nd September, Sir J. Pauncefote forwarded copies of further papers received from Sir H. Layard, which show the further steps taken to compel the Turks to adopt vigorous measures in the Persian Gulf. Early in September, in consequence of a despatch from the Political Resident at Baghdad on the increase of piracy in the Gulf, Sir H. Layard addressed the following note verbale to the Porte in continuation of previous notes on the same subject:— ' Her Majesty's Ambassador considers it his duty to communicate to the Sublime Porte, and to recommend to its serious consideration the accompanying extracts from a despatch addressed to him by Her Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad, relating to piracy in Turkish waters in the Persian Gulf. ' The Sublime Forte is, no doult, aware that the British Government at a great sacrifice of life and treasure succeeded, after many years, in putting an end to piracy in those waters. Her Majesty's Government can never permit that British interests and commerce should suffer ly its revival in consequence of their recognition of Turkish jurisdiction over certain parts of the Arabian coast. It must be quite evident to the Sublime Forte that, if the state of things des cribed by Her Majesty's Consul-General he allowed to continue, Her Majesty's Government will be compelled to take such measures as may be necessary for the protection of British subjects and shipping in the Persian Gulf. ' . W0l dd appear from the reports which have reached Her Majesty's Embassy, that the responsibility for this recent revival of piracy mainly rests with Abdulla Pasha, the Governor of Busreh, who has shown himself indifferent to the urgent representations made to him on the subject by the British authorities, and has failed to adopt the means required for suppress ing piracy and for punishing those who have been guilty of it. ' Her Majesty's Embassy has much satisfaction in admitting: that Ahmed Bey, who was sent some months ago to command the Turkish squadron in the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf, showed an earnest desire to deal with this grave evil. ' It is with much regret that Her Majesty's Ambassador has heard of his untimely death. It is to be hoped that his successor will prove equally active and equally determined to discharge the duty confided to him, notwithstanding any opposition that he may receive from Abdulla Pasha. Should, however, the tribes on the Arabian coast over which the Sublime Porte claims jurisdiction revert to those piratical habits from which they were deterred by the action of the British authorities, and should the safety of British shipping and British subjects be again endangered by such piratical attacks as are described in the accompanying documents, the Forte must alone be responsible for the consequence.' 422. It will be observed that in this note verbale Sir H. Layard admits that Turkish jurisdiction on certain parts of the Arabian coast has been re- cognized; and he throws the responsibility for the further continuance of piracies upon the Turkish Government. Apparently it was intended that the action of Her Majesty's Government would be restricted to the measures necessary for the protection of British subjects and shipping in the Gulf.109 422A. To Sir H. Layard's note the Turkish Foreign Minister replied as follows :— ' 'No. 181, ' 'S P ome, ' ' Min, des aff. etrange, le 8 Septemhre 1879. ' Note verhale. ' Le ministere des affaires etrangeres a regu efc commnnique avec son annexe au dep. de la marine la note verbale que Tambassadeur de S. M.

The remaining despatches noted hy the Secretary of State are No. 91, dated 2ftth July, and Nos. 102 and 104, dated 1st September. The first of these dealt specially 'with the losses suffered by the Chief of Bahrein, and explained the action which the British Government was bound by treaty to undertake to recover compensation. It also enclosed a letter from Colonel Boss, contradicting, for reason given, Colonel Nixon's opinion that the recent piracies in the Gulf had emanated from internecine quarrels among the tribes on the mainland. Colonel Koss attributed them to the neglect of the Turkish authorities to deal vigorously with the offenders at the beginning. The next despatch is No. 102, dated 1st September, which enclosed papers relating to a fresh piracy by the Beni Hajir and the orders issued to Colonel Boss. The remaining despatch No. 104, dated 1st September, sent home the correspondence relating to the surrender of Ali bin Jabir to the Sheikh of Bahrein.' 423. In continuation of his despatch No. 40 of the 6th November 1879, dealt with in the foregoing note, the Sec Political a. may 1880, No. 37. retary of State in his despatch No. 4 (Secret) of 29th January 1880, forwarded further correspondence between the India and foreign Offices on the subject of Turkish jurisdiction along the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, and the maintenance of the peace of the seas in those parts. Tor reason explained in the correspondence, the policy suggested by Sir Louis Mallet in his letter of the 17th September (quoted in paragraph 412) was not adopted; but Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was authorized to propose to the Turkish Government an arrangement under which, in the territorial waters of that portion of the mainland, where Ottoman authority had been to some extent established, i.e, along the coast north of Odeid, British cruizers would be allowed sufficient liberty of action for the repression of piracy, 424. In the course of the discussion the Foreign Office submitted to the Law officers of the Crown a point of international law, whether, under the circumstances shown in the correspondence on this subject, and in view ot the unwillingness or inability of the Turkish Government to prevent outrages by piratical bands organized in, and emanating from, territories under eir authority and jurisdiction, Her Majesty's Government would be justified in authoriaing the commanders of Her Majesty's ships to pursue the mra esan marauders in Turkish waters, and to destroy their strongholds on the lurkisb mainland. 425 The Law officers held that the circumstances, as stated, would not iuslify such a course. Lord Salisbury therefore considered that there were other and larger considerations of Imperial policy, which rendered it inex pedient to adopt a course in the matter which m'ght he regarded hy the Porte as unfriendly and aggressive, or might be P om . ted o ut ^ showing an intention of subverting or weakening the Sultan s authority m a portion of his Asiatic dominions. [CgCTiDJno 426. The result was that Sir H. A. Layard was informed that the existing state of affairs could not be allowed to continue, and that the Turkish Govern^ ment must be called upon co-operate for tbe suppression of piracy. Her Majesty's Government proposed for this purpose that the commanders of Her Majesty's ships, charged with the duty of keeping the police of the Persian Gulf, while they would be instructed to pursue their operations, as far as possible, outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid, should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the three-mile limit on that part of the coast, whenever this course of proceed ing might seem indispensable to the attainment of their object. It would be understood that in the case of any Turkish vessels of war being within reach, the British cruizer would not act without inviting the co-operation of its com mander, and leaving to him, if he desired it, the principal share in the operations, and further that whenever practicable, the previous consent of any Turkish Governor or similar official on the. mainland immediately adjacent would be solicited. In either case any prizes made within recognized Turkish limit would be dealt with according to the wishes of th/3 Turkish authorities. Sir H. Layard was directed to ascertain whether such an arrangement would be accepted bv the Sultan's Ministry. 427. In a more confidential communication, Sir H. Layard was instructed that, wherever the Turkish authority was at the time actually and firmly estab' liihed upon the coast, Her Majesty's Government were ready to recognize it&gt; and would be glad to see it accompanied by a regular and civilized administra tion. Further as regards Maslcnt, Bahrein, and the possetnons of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and Mas-el-Khyma inclusive, Her Majesty's Government, while they considered it unnecessary to seek for any formal declaration from the Porte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those territories, were in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of these claims, and considered themselves bound by their treaty engagements ^ with the several Chiefs to resist any attempt, whether direct or indirect to give them practical effect. 428. In discussing the proposals given above, the Ambassador was directed to express these considerations to the Turkish Ministers, in order to show how far the arrangement was intended to extend, and what might be the possible consequences of refusing it. Sir H. Layard was further given discretion to abstain from any attempt at an arrangement of the kind proposed if he thought fit, in which case it migbt be better simply to leave to Her Majesty's naval officers a certain discretion as to visiting the waters of the El-Hasa coast for police purposes, obtaning the previous consent of the local authorities whenever possible, and taking the risk of remonstrance in other cases. If he considered it advisable to suspend action on these instructions, he was asked to propose an alternative course. In any case, he was, directed to make it clear to the Porte that Her Majesty s Government could not acquiesce in further attempts to meet their representations and overtures by delay and evasion, while the evil which it was desired to repress continued unabated. 429. In His Secret despatch No. 44 of 12th November 1880, the Secretary Secret, January 1881, No. no. State forwarded a copy of further . , , , . , J-. . correspondence on the subject. From this despatch it appeared that the instructions given to Sir H. Lavard were communicated to the Porte by his order in a memorandum by Sir A' Sandison. Abedine Pasha, Governor-General of Baghdad, subsequently requested bir A. Sandison to furnish him in writing with views of Her Majesty's Govern ment. Mr. Goschen took the opportunity thus offered to address the following note to the Governor-General:— ' Dated Therapia, 7th July 1880. '• From E.oht Hob'blb G. J, Goschen , M. P., H. B. M.'s A m ba s ™dor .t Constantioople, ' ^ His Excbixency Abbdine Pasha, Governor-General of Baghdad. ' I have the honour to invite Yonr Excellency's serious attention to a subject which has been repeatedly brought to the notice of Sublime Porte by Sir H. Layard, m., the injurys (L m inflicted on^he commToe o£ the Persian Gulf bv the suceossion of oiratical expeditions which l.ave issued duang the course o£ the last two years and upward from a portion of the coast of Arabia over winch the Porte claims to have established its jurisdiction. '.'■rom the reports which have reached Her Majesty's Embassy of the injuries sustained by British subjects, or others under British protection from these attacks, it is evident that unless the marauders are effectually checked and punished, the peaceful traders of those waters will be seriously disturbed. ' Certainly there has been no want of courtesy or good-will in the replies which have been returned by the Porte to Sir H Layard's representations. But unfortunately whether from the lack ot alacrity on the part of the local officials, or the want of an adequaie means for efficient naval or military measures, the assurances of the Central Government have not received any practical fulfilment upon the spot. As yet little has been done by the Turkish authorities towards the capture or punishment of the offienders, and so far as Her MajestVs Government aie awaie^ there has been no attpmpt on their part to obtain the recovery or restitution of the plundered property, and there is too much reason to anticipate that the oUenders emboldened by the absence of proper measures of prevention will continue their depredations upon a large scale. Indeed, a report has lately reached Her Majesty's Embassy that the Beni Hajir tribe have again been plundering boats of the Gutter coast in the Persian Gulf. It i a clear that such a state of tilings should not be allowed to continue either in the interests of the Turkish Government itself, or in that of other countries interested in the commerce of the Persian Gulf. ' It would indeed, be incredible that the Turkish Government should allow any country \ really and effectively subject to its authority to be made use of in time of peace as a station for the preparation of marauding expeditions directed for purposes of indiscriminate plunder against the commerce of the surrounding waters, and Her Majesty's Government are convinced that the Porte will readily co operate in any plan which may seem well adapted to prevent such a contingency, and the irritating claims and questions to which it cannot tail to give rise. ' They would propose for this purpose that the commanders of Her Majesty's ships charged with the duty of keeping the police of the Persain Gulf, while they could be instructed to pursue their operations outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Aden (? sic Odeid), should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the three-mile limit on that part of the coast whenever this course of proceeding mi^ht seem indispensable to the attainment of their object. ' It would be understood that in case of any Turkish vessel-of-water being in reach, the British cruiser would not act without the co-operation of the Turkish commander, and leaving to him, if he desired it, the principal share in the operations, and further that, whenever practicable the previous consent of any Turkish Governor, or similar official on the mainland immediately adjacent, would be solicited. u In either case any prizes made within recognized Turkish limits could be dealt with according to the wishes of the Turkish authorities. ' I hare now the honour to reqnpst that Your Excellency will take this matter into your consideration, and that you will have the goodness to inform me at an early opportunity whether the Subime Porte is disposed to enter into an engagement of the nature described above, the tendency of which would be rather to establish than in any way to diminish the Sultan's authority in the districts concerned.' 430. Mr. Goschen at the same time forwarded the following memoraudum by Mr. Plowden:— .n « MEMORANDUM. ' Turkish Jurisdiction on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, ' 1- It appears that in the recent correspondence on the subject of Turkish jurisdiction in the Gulf, the British Government has used expressions which amount to an acquiescence in the existence of some Turkish authority on the El-Hassa coast, consequently Your Excellency has resolved to conclude with the Ottoman Government an arrangement of the kind described in Foreign Office No. 12 of 5th January, and to reject the alternative policy suggested in another Foreign Office despatch No. 13 of the same date. ' All I could venture to say on this point is that an arrangement of the kind contemplated in despatch No. 12, based as it is upon a definite recognition of Turkish sovereignty, may be expected to facilitate the establishment of Turkish claims on the Arabian coast generally, and will thereby strengthen in a very considerable degree the advantage already gained by the Porte from the tenor of recent correspondence. Putting aside this correspondence, with the precise nature of which I am not acquainted, valid objections exist to the Turkish title both in El-Hassa and elsewhere on the coast. The conclusion of tne proposed arrangement 1112 will it appears to me, stop tKe British Government from pleading 1 those objections on any future occasions. The admissions which have been made, however much they are to be regretted, are perhaps still capable of being explained away, but once an arrangement has been concluded which formally recognises the Turkish claims, we shall not be able to go behind it. Again, while it is possible that serious considerations may mHuence the Porte to accept the contemplated arrangement, it is also conceivable that they may after some dis cussion and correspondence back out of it. They may take the ground that their sovereign rights extend far bf^lovv El-Hassa, and that they cannot consent to any understanding by which these rights will be abbreviated. In this event the fact of our having endeavoured to conclude the arrangement, whereby Turkish sovereignty on the El-Hassa coast was acknowled ged, would place us in a worse position logically than that which we now occupy in conse- Qnfnce of the language of passed communications. It would, for instance, augment the difficulty now felt inlsanctioning local visits for police purposes by British men-of-war. ' 2. With regard to the arrangement itself, I beg to suggest— * (1.) That its operation be confined— ' (a) to the El-Hassa coast and waters, and ' (6) to those portions of that coast where Turkish authority may for the time being actually and firmly established. ' (2.) That pirate captured by British officers in pursurance of the provisions of the arrangement bp dealt with under the orders of the Resident at Baghdad or the Besident at Bushire as may be most convenient. 'With regard to (6), the Foreign Office despatch proposes the recognition of Turkish jurisdiction wherever Turkish authority is at the pre ent time actually and firmly established. For the words 'at the present time 3 I propose to substitute the words 4 for the time being/ because it is not improbable that the Turks may be ousted from the positions which they now occupy of the coast, and if this contingency should arise, we should be relieved from the obli gation of recognizing Turkish jurisdiction on any given part of the coast, the moment Turkish authority ceased to be actively and firmly established there. ' 8. The exact point to which the El-Hassa coast extends is pprhaps not certainly known. It is, however, necessary that we should be fix in our own minds the limits of that coast, so that British officers may know the teiritory which is understood by the British Government to be comprehended in the arrangement. The sea line of the El-Hassa coast has been described as extending from the mouth of the Shat-ul-Arab to a point nearly opposite to the island of Demaun just south of Katif, between the 26th and 27th parallel of latitude. If this definition be accepted a considerable portion of the very coast which has of late years been used by the pirates as thfir principal resort will be excluded from the operation of the arrangement. In other words, the action of British officers on this part of the coast will be unfettered by any consideration of Turkish claims to sovereignty. Again El Bidaa, with its so-called dependency, Walera, is situated on the El Katr (Guttur), coast. El Bidaa therefore would also be beyond the operation of the arrangement. That is, if I understand correctly the effect of the arrange ment, the Turkish claims to the tract from Demaun to Ojair and El Bidaa will be ignored, and if need be repudiated/' 431. Mr Go^chen observed that the main point of Mr. Plowden's memo randum was the alleged inexpediency of recognising the sovereignty of the Turks even north of Odeid, and that he would so frame the action of Her Majesty's Government as to recognize these claims as little as possible. This however, Mr. Goschen said, did not appear to be the policy to which expression was • pontic.! a , May 1830, no. 53. Sf™ » Lord Salisbury's despatch No. 13* of 5th January 1880, in which His Lord ship stated that the views of Her Maiesty's Government upon the matter were decided ' Wherever the Turkish authority is at the present time actually and firmly established upon the coast Mey are ready to recognise it, and would be glad to see it accompanied by regular and civilized administration.' 432. The question was then referred by the Foreign Office for Lord Hartington's opinion. In reply, Sir Louis Mallet in his letter of iiOth August 1880 wrote:— 'In reply to the request for Lord Hartington^s views on the subject, I am directed to 6 ^ a t 0 that the terms of Mr. Goschen's note appear to be in strict accord with the instructions con tained in Lord Salisbury's despatch ]No. 12 of the 5th January last, which, as well as the concurrent despatch No. 13, was the result of a very full correspondence with this office ending with my letter of the 29th December 187y,113 'The Secretary o£ State for India, as will be seen from my letter of the 17th September previous, would have preferred a different procedure, under which the commanders of Royal Navy ships in the Gulf would at once have beeo authorized to act as might be necessary for the capture and punishment of marauders, without regard to Turkish claims of pretensions, though scrupulously avoiding collision with Ottoman cruisers or troops the Porte being left to remonstrate against the action which might be taken in any particular case, if it thought fit. Id the face, however, of a report received from the Law otHcers of tne Crown and of other considerations, Lord Salisbury was reluctant to sanction so decided a course, and, under the^e circumstances, Lord Cranbrook felt that he had no alternative but to acquiesce in an attempt, in the first instance, to come to s&gt;me friendly arrangement with the Porte. ' As regards Mr. Plowden's objections, I am directed to state that his memorandum, as Mr. Gosohen observes, reproduces the views of the Indian Foreign Office which were fully con sidered when the correspondence of last year was in progress. With respect to the territorial limits within which Ottoman jurisdiction might recognized, it was then deliberately decided that, while interference either at Odeid, or with Bahrein, or with the coast occupied by the Trucial Chiefs, and the Saltan of Maskat, should not be permitted, there was no sufficient reason—provided the peace of the seas was preserved.—for objecting to such relations between the Turkish authorities in El-Hassa and the tribes to the north of Odeid as might be agreeable to the parties concerned. ' Lord Hartingtrm is of opinion, therefore, that Mr. Goschen's proceedings should be approved. His Lordship would, however, suggest that tha particular attention of His JExcel- leucy should be drawn to paragraph 2 of Lord Salisbury's 4 very confidential' despatch, No. 13 of the 5th January last, which refers to possible Turkish pretensions over Maskat, Bahrein, and the possessions of the Trucial Chiets and re-affirms the aften declared policy of Her Majesty's Government in respect to those territories. ' It also appears to Lord Hartington to be very desirable that Mr. Goschen should not permit himself to be entangled m any discussion with the Porte on the territorial question, but that, in the event of reply to his note beinar either long delayed, or evasive, or otherwise unsatisfactory in tenor, the negotiations at Constantinople should be dropped. It Would then be for consideration whether the policy suggested in my letter of 17th September 1879 should not be reverted to.' A copy of tins letter was forwarded to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople for his guidance in negotiations with the Porte. In a subsequent despatch to the Eoreign Office, Mr. Goschen suggested that, should he be unable to obtain any Secret, jmnavy 1881, No. 116. satisfactory offer of an arrangement from the Porte, the commanders of Her Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf might be instructed not to allow themselves to be too much hampered by the three-mile limit in pursuing and capturing pirates, especially as the Turkish authority on the coast was at so many points of a very shadowy description. 434. This despatch was sent to the India Office, and Lord Hartington con curred with Lord Granville in thinking that the Porte should be called upon, for a reply to Mr. Gosehen's note of the 7th July 1880, which, as already shown proposed that, subject to certain restrictions, Her Majesty's cruizers should be permitted to act freely within the territorial waters of that portion of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf where Turkish authority was imperfectly established. Should that reply be delayed, or be unsatisfactory in tenor, His Lordship was of opinion that Her Majesty's ships engaged in the suppression of piracy in the Gulf should he instructed not to permit their operations to he hampered hy considerations connected with 0 ttoman claims to juris diet ion along the coast' Mr. Goschen was accordingly instructed, on the 26th October 1880, to press for a reply from the Porte to the proposals contained in his note to Abedine Pasha of the 7th July 1880. 435. As no arrangement could '^e arrived at with either tbe Porte or the Pasha secret January issi. No. lie. of Baghdad, Her Majesty s Government secret December 1881, Nos. 224—158. ultimately decided that the naval officers on the East Indian Station should not be hampered by the three miles limit in pursuing pirate craft in Turkish waters, ibid Prof, No. 224. ^g ee g ecre t ar y 0 f State's Despatch No. 2^, dated 5th August 1881).

The Resident therefore Hoped that the matter might be referred again to Her Majesty's Government. 4i2. Colonel Ross also reported in his letter No. 172. dated 23rd December External a., May 1888, Nos. 103-105 (No. 103), 1886, ' that certain sailors belonging to -v , Bahrein boats had been plundered in the Ihll T v was under Turkish occupation.'

With retrence to this suggestion the question was whether Her Majesty's Government aa not objected to raising the question of Turkish sovereignty over the (ad jacent) J£atar coast, and whether the same considerations applied to the Katif coast, 443. In this (the Katif) part of the case the questions for consideration were— Jirst, and whether the Resident in the Gulf should or should not formally protest 4 against the lawlessness prevailing about Katif,' and secondly, whether a reference should or should not be made to the Secretary of State about the applicability to the Katif coast of the view taken in 1883 regarding iurkish sovereignty. • See para. 440, ante, t fcee Katar Freeis,116 4-44. The Eesident's statements regarding the Turkish occupation of Katif as distinguished from other parts of the Arabian Coast of the Gulf were quite correct. The despatches cited in chapter eleventh were sufficient to show that K.atif was, and is recognised as being, in the effective possession of the Turks, and that other parts of the Arabian Coast were not so, and were not recognised • as being so. 445. It was further clear from correspondence summarised above (see Section III Chapter Eighth) that the Turkish possession of the Katif coast had been frequently recognised hy complaints against the Turkish authorities on account of outrages committed in that neighbourhood. In 1882 Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, on the representation of the Resident in Turkish Arabia, addressed a special and general protest to the Porte on the subject. In these circumstances the Government of India asked the Secretary of State's definite instructions whether it was still desired by Her Majesty's Gov ernment that representations to the Porte should not^ be made in respect of piracies committed off the ELatif coast (Despatch ISo. 44, dated 11th April 1887). 446. The following instructions were then issued to Sir W. White by Her Maiesty's Government in June Kxternal A., Angnst 1887i Nos. 100-105. 1887 ' Her Majesty'i Government have on several occasions recognized the de facto authority of ■the Turkish Government over the Katif Coast, although they have had reason on more than one occasion to complain that it is not exercised efficiently for the repression or punishment of suchr acts, as those reported in the enclosed papers. Her Majesty's Government hate, on the other hand, refused to admit that the Sultan has any rights of sovereignty over the Katar Coast and have c aimed right of dealing directly with the Chiefs on that coast. A correspondence took place on this subject betweem Lord Granville and Musurus Pasha., in 1883, of which Your Excellency will find copies in the archives of Her Majestiy's Embassy. In January 1887 the Earl of Dufferin reported that he had addressed a representation to the Porte on the subject of an act of piracy committed on a Bharein beat by the Beni Hajir Arabs residing in the neighbourhood of Katif. A promise was given to make renqniry into the matter and to send the necessary instructions to prevent any recurrence of such act. The report, however, which was received from the Wali of Baghdad was of an unsatisfactory character and entirely at variance with the account received from the British authorities. It even denied that any tribe of the name given existed in the neighbourhood of Katif. Lord Dufferin, as reported in his despatch No. 593 of 26th October 1883, thereupon presented a memorandum to the Porte, reiterating the details of the outrage, and the Minister tor Foreign Affairs promised a renewed investigation. No satisfactory result, however, was to be an ticipated, and in view of the controversy that was taking place as to the rights of the Porte over the neighbouring coast of Katar, it was not thought desirable to pursue the matter. Instructions to this effect were addressed to Lord Dufferin in Earl Granville's despatch No. 407 of Sisth November 1883. The Resident in the Persian Golf now calls attention to the fact that Katif is completely in Turkish possession, that its occupation has been repeatedly recognised, and that such recog nition does not necessarily affect other parts of the coast. It appears further from the reports received from the Residency Agent at Bahrein that a Turkish Government steamer was anchored at Katif at the time when the recent acts of piracy were committed but made no effort to prevent or punish them. Under these circumstances I have to instruct Your Excellency, unless you should think that for some reason such a course would be inexpedient, to brino; tha facts to the notice of the Turkish Government and to represent to them the injury that is caused to the peaceful trade of the Gulf by the state of lawlessness, which is permitted to exist at Katif and in its neigh bourhood. It is scarcely to be expected that your remonstrances will have much practical result, but it may be desirable that the Turkish. Government should understand clearly that Her Majesty's Government consider them responsible for the recurrence of these outrages.117 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (VI) Piracies in 1887-88, 447.

When Her Eitersal A., August 1888 Nos. 411*446 (No. 412 Majesty's GoTernment were apprised of these acts of piracy, they caused Sir W. White to address a note verhale to the Porte in July 1887, in which reference was made to several representations made to the Porte previously about tbe piracies in the Katif waters, and while disclaiming any intention of discussing the rights claimed by each Power along the Coast, it was pointed out that posses sion of any territory entails obligations and that any acts of negligence gives a corresponding right of compensation' 449. About the 12th of November 1887 the British Embassy at Constanti- o x. 0^1 nople made further strong representations External A..

On 29th November 1887, Sir W. A. White reported that be had again made a representation to the Grand Vizier. His Highness said, that a second gun-boat had been despatched te the Katif waters and that the enquiries insti tuted by the first gun-boat had led to the discovery of only one case of 14 robbery It was then pointed out to His Highness that there could be no doubt as to the number of the piracies reported to Her Majesty's Government, and it was urged that no satisfactory results could he got unless action was taken hy land. 451. In December 1887 Mr, Robertson (Consul at Basrah) pointed out the _ necessity of taking action against the Beni Ihidj No. 859, i'|- •• i i J • i.i • j Hajirs, by land, since these pirates were not sea-farring people. He also described the naval force of the Turks pre sent in the Persian Gulf, and expressed the opinion that ** any material increase in the Turkish naval power in those waters which might result from pressure in connection with robberies of boats off the Katif Coasts would he almost un* desirable than themselves, and that for every reason action on land should he urged rather than action at Sea. 452. Quoting this remark of Mr. Robertson, Sir W. A. White in hi 8 External a., August 1888, Nos. 411-441, (No .wo), despatch dated 18th February 1888, men- tioned that two Turkish ships had pro ceeded to the Persian Gulf, and that it was in contemplation to send additional ships, and observed :— ' I do not see how, after having on various occasions urged the Turkish Government to take steps for the supression of piracies in the the Persian Gulf, I can now make any objec tion to the reinforcement of their naval force in those waters.' 463. There were reported two or three more piracies on the Katif Waters t . . toqov jjq \ in April and May 1888. But this time External A., August 1888, Noa. 441-446 (No. 443). ^ \, T ., J , , , , . Sir W. White contented himself with calling the attention of the Grand Vizier to these piracies, in view of the opinions expressed above as to the increase of the Turkish naval force in the Persian Gulf, and asked for instructions as to further action. Her Majesty's ibid, No. 444. Government, decided that it would be undesirable to take any further steps in the matter in view of the probability of an increase of the Turkish naval force in the Fersian Gulf should Her Majesty's Government urge the Ottoman Forte to take more active measures. 454. Colonel Ross did not wholly see the wisdom of this policy, and in for- Eiternal A , January 1888, Nos. 160-177 (No. 159). warc ^ n &amp; ^ l et ter of the Chief of Bahrein complaining of another act of piracy, and pressing for energetic measures being taken to put a stop to the piracies, observed (Letter No, 276 dated 15th September 1888) :— t( What Sheikh Esau undoubtedly feels most keenly is the continuance of a state of law lessness and insecurity at Katif and iu the adjoining waters, where crime is on the increase. From the indifference of the Turkish authorities and consequent impunity to the robbers, the mischief spreads and general insecurity on the seas prevail. Owing to the shallowness of the waters about Katif, vessels of war are unable to operate, and the only course open has been to make remonstrances to the Turkish Government. Although no attempt to afford redress has ever been apparent, still the repeated remonstrances of Her Majesty's Ambassador at the Porte did, during the Government of Nafiz Pasha at Basrah, pro duce some effect. Since the departure of the Wali and cessation of British remonstrances matters have gone from bad to worse, and the complaint of the Chief of Bahrein is well founded. From the latest correspondence on this subject, forwarded to me under your office docket No. 1558-E., dated 30th July 1888, 1 1 eai'n that Her Majesty's Government consider it un desirable to press the Government of the Porte further in regard to these complaints. I under-119 stand that Her Majesty's Government have been led to tl.is conclusion, from the promises (1) that an i7icrease of the larJctsh NavaL force in these waters is undesirable, and (2) that persis tence tn wgtng the Porte to maintain order in their waters of Katif would lead to that undt* sir able increase of Naval force, A • t ^ 0 g ue9 . lion J s one of much importance in connection with our efforts to supress piracy in the Persian Gulf, I venture most deferentially to submit for consideration that, in the first place, it %s action on the land by the authorities on land and in districts occupied by Turkey that ts required, a fact which might be always dwelt on in communicating with the Turkish Government Ihen, it does not appear from the disposition hitherto shown that the Porte attaches much real importance to the supression of piracy, or that they would go to any con siderable expense for that object. Certainly thev might make the representations a pretext for reinforcing their squadron at Basrah j but then, if they have any wish to do that, they do not require any invitation or permission to do so at any time. However undesirable the increase of the Turkish squadron may be, I would respectfully submit that the continued indifference of the Turkish authorities is seriously injuring our interests and prestige. This latter is an existing and pressing evil; and 1 am disposed to think that the Government of India may attach more importance to it than to the possible addition of another vessel or so to the Turkish Naval force in these waters'. 455. The foreign Office forwarded a copy of Colonel Ross's letter to External a , March 1889, Nos. 300-302. ^ Embassy at Constantinople (Despatch No. 18, dated 16th January 1889) observing : — ' I must, however, leave it to Your Excellency's discretion whether you should make any further representations to the Porte on the subject. I am myself inclined to doubt whether under present circumstances such action would be useful or judicious. The Turkish Govern ment must be perfectly well aware that the state of affairs is unsatisfactory, and it has been repeatedly explained to them that what Her Majesty's Government desire is that they should take effective steps to repress plundering expedition from the coast under Ottoman jurisdic tion without endeavouring to extend the jurisdiction beyond its recognized limits. But the only result which appears to follow representations to this effect is some measure to assist Turkish authority beyond those limits under cover of the restoration of order. It is difficult to suppose that this course of action is unintentional on the part, at all events, of the local authorities, and it seems undesirable to give excuse for proceedings which will cause fresh irritation and suspicion.'120 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (VII) Piracies in 1891-92. , . „ , ... 456. The year 1891 was fruitful of External A| March 1892, Nob* 191-207* • • j-i - tt - i. # p 'ttt l o i • i piracies on the Katif Waters, of which a list is subjoined Zist of piracies committed in the Turkish waters of the Persian Oulf from June to August. Vo. Period of occurrence. 18th June 1891 Ditto July 1891 20tb August 1891 Particulars of occurrence. About 14 men supposed to belong to the Beni Hajir tribe boarded a shooi lying in the port of Seybat. They killed one of the crew and threw the rest into the sea. The same men then captured a boat belonging to Basri, killed one of the crew and took everything that could be found ; some lucerne grass, date sticks, and even the fails. A shooi of Katif was boarded near Ojair by 18 men of the Beni Hajir tribe. One of the crew was wound ed ; and the pirates carried away Rs. 223 in cash some dollars, gear belonging to the shooi, its canoe and sails also two slaves forming part of the crew, and a cousin of the Nakhoda whom they took for a slave. Some 16 Bedouins of the Beni Hajir tribe attacked a Persian shooi of Tahiriyeh, containing a cargo of wheat, sheep hides, charcoal and fire-wood intended for Bahrein. Most of the goods were landed at Selwa by the robbers, who also carried away property consisting of gold, pearls, copper utensils, clothes, sails, etc., amounting in value to Rs. 2,495. One of the lascars of the shooi was also taken away by the pirates, but he is said to have escaped eventually. Eemaekb. The Turkish troops were to have gone in pursuit of the robbers; but it is not reported whether any attempt was made at the time to capture the latter. The Turkish gun-boat Sahir appears how ever, to have been despatched later on, but the robbers could not be found. Turkish troops were sent in pursuit, but the robbers could not be found. The Turkish are said to have taken no action in the matter.121 467. 'With a view to the suppression and prevention of such piracies, Major md. No. 207. Talbot, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in a letter to Colonel Mockler pro posed to obtain the consent of the Ottoman Government to the action of our cruisers within the Katif waters, either in combination with, or independently of, its own vessels. 458. This suggestion was supported by Colonel Mockler, but Her Majesty's Secret e , May 1892, Nos. los-iis, (No. no). Government deemed it inadvisable to act upon it, and the following were the instinc- tions which the Poreign Office addressed to Sir Clare Pord in their Despatch of March 1892 :— ' I have received Mr. Fane's despatch No. 68, of the 25th February 1892, forwarding a despatch addressed to him by the Acting Consul-General at Baghdad on the subject of piracy in the Turkish waters of the Persian Gulf. The view of Her Majesty's Government in regard to the action to be taken by the Com manders of Her Majesty's steamships in cases of the kind reported by Colonel Mockler, are contained in Earl Granville's despatch to the Earl of Dufferin, No. 515, of 22nd July 1881, to which 1 have to refer Your Excellency. In consequence of the failure of the Porte to protect British and general commerce in the Persian Gulf, and its refusal to make any special arrangements with Her Majesty's Govern ment by which Her Majesty's steamships should be permitted to pursue pirates within Turkish waters in places where the Sultan's authority was not well established, new instructions were at that time issued to British Naval officers. They were authorized in future, when necessary* to take such measures as th^y thought fit for the protection of British commerce and shipping without reference to the Sultan's claims to territorial jurisdiction. The attitude of Her Majesty's Government in this matter should be explained to Colonel Mockler, and he ihould he infoimed that they do not consider it advisable to invite the co-opera tion of the Turkish authorities as suggested by Colonel Talbot, in his despatch of 31st December 1891' 459. These views were duly communi cated to Colonel Mockler. Bxternal A, June 1892, Nos. 122-180. Turkish 460. We had again to face the question of suppression of piracies in the dsh waters on 1892.

They killed the Nacada, wounded two of the crew and carried off 700 dollars. Turkish troops were sent in pursuit, and 10 robbers captured, but none of the boats recovered. Seo paragraphs 434 and 4S5 supra [C967PD] PP122 461. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, proposed that the Lawrence might be fitted out as a war vessel, and lui, Nos. 114 and 13a that it might be ulitized in addition to the only man-of-war now at his disposal for police duties in the Persian Gulf, and especially the Katif waters. This proposal was supported by the Foreign De partment and referred to the Military (Marine Department.) 462. It was reported subsequently that some of the plundered property , had been restored to its owners, and the saeret e, marc , os. - . question then asked was whether appli cation should be made to the Porte for further reparation to the injured persons. Lord Rosebery was inclined to doubt the expediency of addressing the Porte in the matter, an opinion in which the India Office concurred.123 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (yiii) Piracies in 1899-00. 463. In 1899 four cases of piracy were reported. In 1900 there were five more Secret E., February 1900, Nos. 68-69. CaSCS. Secret E.| November 1900, Noi. 61-69. 464. The details of the several piracies committed in 1899 and 1900 were as follows;— (1) In Pebruary 1899 a Persian boat was plundered off Abu Zaluf on the Katar coast. It was subsequently reported, however, that it was doubtful secret e., february 1900. No. 68. wlicther this was genuine case of piracy. Secret E., April 1901, No, 87. (2) On the 11th August 1899, a boat belonsring to a Bahrein subject was attacked and plundered near the Shakta pearl banks in the vicinity of Katif. The pirates are said to have belonged to Daren in the same neighbourhood. e v -nnn « |.q The value of the property stolen was not Secret E, February 1900, No. 68. , i , ii J i* • -jx reported, but a small proportion is said to have been recovered.

(presumably Thakireh, on the east coast of Katar). The boat was subsequently recovered through Sheikh Ahmed-bin. Thani of Katar. (4) In August 1899, two boats belonging to British Indian subjects were plundered at Dibal on the Katar coast. One of the boats was carried off and „ „ abandoned near Zobarah on the same Seoret e ., February 1900, o. 2. coast. The total value of the property stolen was over Bs. 16,000. Part, to the value of Es. 2,067, was recovered through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katar. (5) On the 17th August 1900, a Bahrein boat was plundered on the Khora pearl bank near Has Tanaura by men from Daren. One of the Persians in the boat was drowned, and property valued at Rs. 3,924 was carried off. As the result of representations to the Mutassarif Sect e , June mm , Ho. w. o£ Hasaj a sllm of Es yrjg.^ together with pearls, were eventually restored to the owner.

Most of the property belonged to Turkish subjects and was recovered124 oy the Mutassarif of Hasa who punished the tribe responsible for the outrage. None of the property belonging to the Bahrein owners appears to have been restored. 466. There was considerable delay in taking measures for obtaining redress in the first fourth and eighth of the cases mentioned above. Of these the two piracies which occurred off the coast of Katar in 1899 were reported by Colonel Meade on October 9th, 1899. Colonel Meade then said he would postpone his recommendations for exacting reparation secret e., february 1900, no#. 68-76. until he had consulted the Senior Naval Officer. On the 28th October 1899 he telegraphed that he proposed first to demand restoration of property, or failing this, payment of indemnity, otherwise a punitive expedition could be arranged. We replied by telegram on 2nd November 1899 that Colonel Meade might, at his discretion, demand restoration of property or indemnity, but a punitive expedition would, of course, require distinct sanction from Government. On the 17th November 1899 Colonel- Meade telegraphed that he proposed shortly to visit the Trucial Chiefs and would enquire into the piracies on his way. 466. On the 2nd of December 1899, Colonel Meade reported that he had enquired into the cases, that some of the property had been recoverd by bheikh Ahmed -bin-Thani, and that the latter had promised to recover as much as he could of the remainder. Colonel Meade added that he would report again in a month, and that he did not think that anything in the shape of an expedi tion would be necessary. 467. Colonel Meade did not fulfil his intention of reporting again, and we heard nothing more on the subject until Secret e, November 1900, Nos. 61-69, (No. September 1900, when Colonel Kemball, ■who had succeeded Colonel Meade on 17th April 1900, reported that Ahmed- bin-Thani, as was only to be expected, had taken no steps to recover the remainder of the property and had given a very unsatisfactory reply to the letter which Colonel Kemball had written to him. Colonel Kemball mentioned certain suggestions in the way of reprisal which might be feasible^ but made no definite proposals and promised to submit a further report, in which definite recommendations would be made. 468. The next report on the subject is dated the 9th November 1900, in which Colonel Kemball, after finding secret e ., April i9oi, Nos. 83-90 (No. 87). himself unable to recommend the seizure of the Chief's property in Bahrein, or the despatch of a Naval expedition, expressed the opinion that it would be sufficient if he informed Ahmed-bin- Thani that the Government of India consider him to be responsible for the control of the Bedouins who reside in Katar, and that steps would, if necessary, be taken to bring this responsibility home to him. He also proposed to require the Sheikh to warn all boat owners to be careful not to allow their boats to be used by the Bedouins; as in future the owners of the boats used by pirates would be held responsible. The Government of India concurred in these proposals. 469. The third case of piracy, which occurred in August 1900, was reported in September 1900 ; no suggestion was secret e., November 1900, N ob . 61 -69. made for enforcing reparation for this case until October 1901, when Colonel Kemball reported that it might be advisable to attack the Chief's property in Bahrein, and even then no definite proposal was made. 470. In December 1901, Colonel Kemball submitted certain proposals in connection with these piracies. These proposals and the orders passed by the Government will be clear on perusal of Foreign Department letter to Colonel Ross. No. 429 E. A., dated 6th February 1892 ' Your letter deals with three cases of piracy, two of which occurred in August 1899, while the third dates from August 190U. In the third case the stolen property is valued at Rs. 315-8 only, but in two earlier cas Q s property of the value of more than Hs. 12 ; 000 is alleged to have125 been p^undGTed. It is understood tliafc of tlio property stolen in the two piracies 'which occurred in August 1899, a portion, valued at about Rs. 2,067, has been recovered by Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, the Ruling Sheikh of Katar, but that no effort has been made by him to recover the remainder of the property which was looted on those two occasions or to exact redress from the Bedouins who committed the smaller outrage at Graimia Pearl Bank in August 19(10, You may suggest that, in order to obtain compensation for the sufferers by these piracies, the property of the Katar Chief in Bahrein should be attached, or that, as an alternative, the cases should be allowed to drag. A third alternature which was suggested iu your letter No. 270, dated the 19th November 1900, would be to send a boat expedition to punish the villages from which the pirates embarked. The Government of India have decided, in view of the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of these piracies, and of certain pre-occupations in other parts of the Persian Gulf, that active measures for the exaction of redress from the Sheikh of Katar or from the offend ing villages cannot now be wisely or profitably undertaken, and that the cases must be allowed to drop. Having regard, however, to the language held by Colonel Meade to the Sheikh in November 1899, the Government of India have come to their present decision with reluctance, and they cannot but regret that, owing to the want of definite proposals from the successive Political Residents, the opportunity for exacting full and timely reparation for these outrages should have been allowed to pass. In the opinion of the Government of India, some speedy measures of redress should be adopted in future if such outrages are repeated; and, in the event of any fresh case of piracy occurring off the Katar peninsula, the Political Resident should not only cause the property of the Katar Chief in Bahrein to be attached until redress is given, but should also submit proposals at once for a boat expedition against the villages immediately concerned, if that appears to be the best and most effective method of inflicting punishment and enforcing reparation.''' / / [C967FD]126 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (IX)—Piracies in 1902 and proposal of the Chief of Bahrein to main tain an armed dhow for pursuit of pirates, 1902-1903. 471. In 1902 there was recrudescence of piracies in the vicinity of Katif and Bahrein, committed by a^ party of Bewet e., january 1904, Nos. 118-139. Beni Hajir under the leadership of the notorious Ahmed -hin-Selman. In July 1902 they stopped a boat at Seaalis, with which they crossed to the island of Um Nasan, and on 4th August captured a Bahrein dhow of 28 tons burden, which was lying there to load lime for Bahrein, by means of which dhow, some ten days later they waylaid and ro me another Bahrein boat of Thaein in the Katar peninsula, of property valued at $ 5,400. 472. In his letter No. 167, dated 8th December 1902, Colonel Kemball reported that Ahmed-bin-Selman belonged to No - 123 ' the A1 Khalifa branch of the Bahrein Sheikhs, and had been once a subject of Bahrein, bat had long since turned an outlaw. He first settled on Katar but had removed to Katif before the recent piracies were committed. In these circumstances the chief of Katar could not be held responsible for these piracies. The chief of Bahrein proposed that he should be permitted to employ an armed dhow in pursuit of the pirates. He believed that a small vessel like a dhow at his disposal could pursue the pirates' boats at a moment's notice and with great facility and quickness in the narrow channels between Katif and Katar, and Colonel Kemball was inclined to think (par igraph last of his letter No. 167, dated 8th Decern- No - 133 - ber 1902), that the chief might be given the permission applied for on the following conditions (i) That the permission of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein bo obtained in the first instance; (ii) that one of the Chief's sons or other responsible person be put in charge of the boat; (iii) that the operations of the boat be confined to the seas between a point north of Has Tanoura and eastward round of the Katar peninsula towards the neighbourhood of Bidaa. 473. The Government of India then addressed the following letter to Sir C. C. Drury, Commanding His Majesty's Naval Forces, East Indies Station (No.*675-E., dated 16th April 1903) Under the terms of the agreement which he executed in 1861, the Sheikh of Bahreiu is bound to abstain from any act ot aggression No - 124 or retaliation at sea, and any departure from the principle of this agreement might be attended by undesirable risks. At the same time there would probably be considarable advantage in making some special arrangement for the patrolling or policing of the waters in this neighbourhood; cot only on account of the increased security which should result, but also from the point of view that eailier and more accurate information might, if suitable measures were _ adopted, be obtained as o the condition of affairs on the neighbouring mainland. In the circumstances, I am to invi e any suggestions or advice which Your Excellency may be in position to oner on the subject. The alternatives which present themselves to the Government of India are: (i) the maintenance at Bahrein of an armed dhow of the _ class that has, it is understood, been recently employed with good effect in checking piracy and the trade in arms in the Gulf of Aden and the Ked Sea j or (ii) the maintenance by the Sheikh, at his own expense, of a dhow manned hy his own subjects, but which would be commanded by a junior British officer lent from the Royal Navy or from the Royal Indian Marine, to ensure that it only employed for proper purposes. If Your Excellency is able to propose any precise arrangements, I am to request that •n estimate of the probable cost may, if possible, be tnroisbeJ. On receipt of Y our Excellency's reply, tbe Government of India propose to addresi Hia Majesty s Secretary cf State.127 474. His Excellency Sir C. Drury's reply was as follows (letter dated 2~tli April 1903) :— f&lt; In reply to your confidential letter No. 675-E., of the 16th April, be pleased to inform His Excellency tlio Viceroy in Council that I consider that the agreement^ made with thp Sheikh of Bahrein iu 1861, to abstain from any act of aggression or retaliation by sea should still be adhered to as, if it was cancelled, complications might easily arise. I would desire to point out that in my opinion the results achieved by the use of armed dhows in the Gulf of Aden have not been as great a success as is generally supposed, and it is very demoralising service for officers and men. The best course appears to me to be that I should be informed every year when the pearl fishery is to begin and end, and I would then endeavour to arrange for a gun-boat to police those waters during the time the fishery was being carried out. If it is decided that an armed dhow is necessary, I am of opinion that she should be commanded by a Royal Indian Marine officer who would require a commissim fr 0 ™. ^ Admiralty ; the vessel would fly the white ensign and be under the orders of the Naval Commander-in -Chief on this station, and be a tendered to the Senior Naval Officer's ship m the Persian Gulf. She m'^ht be provided and maintained by the Sheikh of Bahrein and partly manned by his subjects, as his interests are primarily affected, but he could have ahsolutely no control over her movements and actions on the high seas. With regard to paragraph 3 of vour letter, the Consul General at Berbera has recently bought and^equipped two armed dhovrs, and could give you all details, so as to enable an estimate of the cost of one to be arrived at. As far as I am aware, thev have each one 3 pounder quick-firing gun. Two Europeans, one as Captain and one as Mate. The Captain receives £ 120 a year. The services of his dhows are confined to the territorial waters of British Somaliland. The dhows recently employed by the Royal Navy in the Gulf of Aden for the suppression of J jis traffio were hired by us at the rate of E b. 325 a month, which moluded the serv.ce. 0fth r;:r fi tt ing9 , etc., were supplied by the ships to which the dhows were atoached. Curzon visited Bahrein and liad an interview with the on 26th November 1903, the latter said that there had been no piracy m jt ^ fM n ot mention the matter of the armed dhow then or later.

Murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij-el-Khalifa, a cousin of the Chief of Bahrein and his party about 40 miles south of Katif. Question of satisfaction and compensation for it- 1900—1804. 4.79. As an instance of Arab inter-tribal feuds and the incapacity of the Secret e., february 1901, Nos. 1-4. lurkish Government to control these unruly .... . „ tribes and their dilatory ineffectual methods in obtaining redress for the most daring crimes, is furnished to us in a case of the murder of a party of Bahreinese, which has been the subject of correspond ence lor some four years. XT 4 ,?-, 0 n T , : e i fa , cU 1 of tf?®, ca . s , e were first; reported in Mr. Gaskin's letter ^ 0 ' * , e December ] 900. The mtirdered Sheikh, on the 18th November 1900, crossed to the mainland on a huntiu? expedition, and took with him his two sons, Diaij and Bishir, a nephew named Abdul Kaliman-bin-ltashid, 20 followers and four companions, one from the Morra one from the Ajman, and two from the Beni Hajir as a precaution a-ainst molestation from the tribes to which they belonged. A party of about fourteen men of the Dowasir tribe of Bahrein crossed at the same time and encamped near Sheikh Selman. On the 3rd December a large bodv of the Almorra Bedouins came on their camels from the interior, and at nightfall, after tethering their camels a few miles from Sheikh Selman's camp, they surprised the hunting party a little after midnight, and massacred them all except Bishir and two followers who escaped with wounds. One of the Sheikh's negroes was said to have killed three of the attacking party before he was killed The Dowasir lost one man who happened to be in the Sheikh's tent, but the'rest of them mannged to escape to their boats and offer no assistance to Sheikh Selman. When Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab Pasha of Darin heard of the carnage, he went out with a number of persons and buried the victims. 481. It was generally thought that the cause which led to these regrettable murders was that, in 1898, some Amameras of Bahrein, while eno-a^ed in hunting on the mainland, were attacked by Almorra robbers, and two of their number were killed. The Amameras to be even with the Almorra killed the son of their Sheikh in 1899, and the Almorra undertook the recent massacre to avenge their Chief's son. The Khalifa family of Bahrein have no blood-fend with the Almorra, and, though the Amameia were residents of Bahrein, their behaviour could not be considered as being sufficient sround for the Almorra to commit the murders. It seemed that the hope of obtaiuine plunder was the inducement. b 482. The Chief of Bahrein, in speaking to the Resident on the ^ubiect m December 1900, said that there were two courses open: 'either that the Briiish Government should represent the matter to the Turkish Government and urge the Turkish authorities to give him redress, or that he should be allowed to organize an expedition to pursue and punish the murderers Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball agreed to represent the matter to the Turkish authorities, through Her Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah, but advised the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to communicate on the subiect with the Kaimmakam of Katif. On the Government of India receivino- the Resident's report on the occurrence, the Secretary of State was addressed by tele-ram and it was said that the case appears to be one in which reparation by Turkish Government must be insisted on. Only alternative would be independent action by Sheikh, which Kemball has properly dissuaded. The telegram was followed up by a despatch in which the suggestion as regards the necessity for obtaining reparation with the least possible delay was reiterated (Despatch No. 7, dated the 17th January 1901.) ^129 483. From a further report of Mr. Gasldn's No. 9, elated the 27th January Secret E., April 1901. Kos. 6-10. ' ^ f appears, that Sheikh Selman and ms party went to the mainland for no other purpose than that of huntino' customary for them to do in that season of the year. The members of the ruling family of Bahrein every year at the end of the autumn make up hawking 1 parties and visit Katar, Thahran (the country between Katif and Ojair) and Lingah, and in accordance with this practice Sheikh Selman, in November 1900, elected to go to Thahran, and others at about the same time went to Katar and Lingah. The Khalifa family, had in fact no blood-feud with any tribe residing in Turkish territory. 481. The question was then raised by the Foreign Office whether the place ^ P . . 110m , ln where the murder occurred was within secret E., Apnl 1901, Nos. 5-10. m i • i -r • i- j * ijj Turkish Jurisdiction. Attention was in vited to the India Office letter, dated the 2nd November 1888, in which it was proposed that Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople should be informed that Her Majesty's Government did not consider that the Porte was in effective occupation of the Arabian Coast beyond Katif. In 1893 Sir C. Ford informed the Porte that Her Majesty's Government while admitting the sovereignty of the Sultan from Basrah to Katif considered that the coast running to the south of that place was looked upon as dehateahle land. The Viceroy on being consulted, replied by telegram on 7th March 1901 :— 'I cannot find that Turkish Territorial Jurisdicfcion south of Katif town has been explicitly recognized. Biot notwithstanding Ford's Despatch of 1893, it is difficult to dispute that Katif district extends to Ojair.' It was also mentioned in the telegram on the authority of Mr. Wratislaw that the Vali of Basrah had ordered the arrest and punishment of the murder ers of Sheikh Selman, &amp;c., and that in these circumstances action by Her Majesty's Government seemed unnecessary. The Foreign Office had, however, in the meantime addressed the Ambassador on the subject and asked for his views. 485. Sir N. O'Conor pointed out the inadvisibility of acknowledging Turkish jurisdiction in a place where it Secret E., June 1901, Nos. 9-17. • is? i* l • j tt it was so meirectively exercised. He there fore proposed awaiting further instructions and was told to defer making any representations on the subject to the Porte until the result of Mr. Wratislaw's representation to the Vali of: Basrah was known. 486. In July 1901 we were informed, through the Resident, that the Vali's „ _ v attitude was unsatisfactory. He replied SecretE., August 1901, Nos. 220-22(;, (No. 220). , ^ , .,f , / to the Consul s remarks with nonchalance, and when he was reminded that the Sheikh of Bahrein might take the matter into his own hands, if the Turkish authorities did not do their duty, his answer was ' that, after all, the occurrence was merely an act of reprisal for a previous crime committed by natives of Bahrein. It was then explained to tim that ' the previous murder referred to had been paid for in the customary manner by the Sheikh of Bahrein and could not be quoted as justification for the assassination of Sheikh Selman.' 487. The Sheikh of Bahrein too, at about this time, requested to be allowed to prosecute his revenge on a party of the offending tribe who were encamped within striking distance on the mainland, but he was warned against making any such attempt by the Assistant Political Agent. 488. In September 1901, the Foreign Office authorised the Ambassador at Secret e ., March 1902, Nos. 78-107, (No. 93 Constantinople 'press for the arrest and Enclosure). punishment of the fugitives while they are in the interior of Arabia,' as, while they were there within Turkish territory, the request would not prejudice the question of Turkish sovereignty on the south coast of Katif. 489. In October 1901, at the request of the Resident, sanction was given by the Government of India for a gunboat 11 ld ' Xo L to be sent to Katif in order to stimulate the Turkish authorities to greater activity in exacting reparation for the murder [C967FD] z8130 and to enquire what steps, if any, had been taken in the matter. Doubt was, however, expressed by Lord Curzon at the time whether any satisfactory result would be produced. The result of the visit of His Majesty's ship Sphinx to Katif, as reported by the Resident in February 1900, was most unsatisfactory, and the attitude of the local Turkish authorities towards the Commander and the Assistant Political Agent, who accompanied, was described as ft decidedly discourteous. 1 ' The report was communicated to the India Office on the 13th March 1902. 490. In a further report (letter No. 74, dated the ?nd April 1902) Lieute nant-Colonel Kemball discussed the secret e., may 1903, Nos. 117-143 (No. m). question of the possibility of obtaining redress, in the event of no satisfactory settlement being made by the Turks. The only suggestion he had was ' that the Chief of Bahrein should be advised to stop transhipment at Bahrein of cargo destined for Katif and Ojair and prohibit trade with those ports until justice is done to him.' This would, in his opinion, effect the Turkish customs and inconvenience the mercantile community of the places, who would probably induce tlie Mutassaril to take early action. The information was also received by the Resident that the Vali of Basrah had received &lt;{ a strongly worded ' telegram from Constantinople directing him to cause the arrest and punishment of the murderers, and it was confirmed in Sir N. O'Conor's despatch No. 68, dated the 20th February 1902, to the Foreign Office, a copy of which was received with the Secretary of State's Secret des patch No. 10, dated the 28th March 1902. The Resident was asked by telesram on the 20th April to furnish the information required in the despatch, &lt;7^.,° whether the Sheikh of Bahrein would accept pecuniary compensation and to what amount. 491. The reply of Colonel Kemball was as follows (No. 4-S. A., dated 6th Jnne 190'2), which might be read as throw - secret e., may 1903, noa. iiv-14''. (no. 128). on the interesting vendetta customs of the Arabs ' The question of pecuniary compensation has been placed before the Chief of Bahrein, who sa ys that, so far as the murders of Shpikh Selman and the ]attar's sod and nephew are con cerned, he cannot accept pecuniary compensation. It is against Arab tradition for a Chief to accept blood-money for the murder of members of his family, and as regards these three murders a settlement of this nature is not possible. On behalf of the relatives of the other twenty-one Bahrein subjects, who were murdered at the same timCj, he is willing to accept pecuniary compensation. He says that, where pecuniary compensation in such cases is offered and accepted, the customary amount paid is 800 Austrian dollars for each life. The blood- money, therefore, for the 21 murdered persons amounts to 18 } H00 dollars, equivalent at the present rate of exchange to Rs. 23,520. On account of the camels and other plundered pro- pf-rtv, he claims Rs 11,620, and his total claim, therefore, amounts to Rs. 35,140. On account of the three murdered members of his family above referred to apparently the Chief requires ' blood for blood/' and he spates that he cannot accept less than the surrender to him of three of the persons implicated in the murder for execution or possible pardon, if it is besought of him in a proper manner by the Chiefs of the Morra tribes. It thus appears that the Chief is willing to accept pecuniary compensation in partial settlement of the case, hut that, for a full and final settlement, he requires that the murderers should be punished, so that the blood-feud between the Bahaih tribe to which the murderers beloow-ed and the Khalifa family may be at an end. It would, of course, be highly satisfactory if the Turkish Government could be induced to effect a settlement of this nature, that is to say, pay the amount of Hs. 35,140 for the 21 murders and the plundered property, and also surrender to the Chief of Bahrein three of the murderers,, or otherwise satisfy him on account of the murders of the three members of his family. Judging, however, from the attitude of the Turks so far and from the unsatisfactory nature of their authority in the Hasa district, I doubt very much if so satisfactory a settlement can be expected at their hands. « The Chief of Bahrein has informed the Assistant P. litical Agent that he has received a communication from Sheikh Ah,i ed-bin-Thani of Katr, to the effect that the Bahaih tii\»e have expressed their desire to come to an arrang ment of a nature which will settle the case, and have asked Sheikh Ahmed to approach the Chief of Bahrein in the matter. The Chief of Bahrein has hitherto refrained from giving Sheikh Ahmed a direct reply, thinking that negotiations with the tribe through him may not be advisahle while the discussions in the case are proceeding at Constantinople between His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador and the Turkish Government If -he were to negotiate with the tribe through Sheikh Ahmed, he cannot yet make a definite statement as regards the nature of the settlement which he would131 make, as he must be guided by tbe eondrtions wbicb the Babaib are willing to accept. He cannot accept I pss than the surrender to him of three of the implicated persons, and lie may leave the families of the other 21 murdered persons to settle their feuds as best they can if the Bahaih decline to pay blood-money. Of course, if the Chief can obtain the surrender of three of the murderers, it puts him in a position which will enable him to dictate to the tribe ; and even if he cannot obtain full compensation for his murdered subjects, he will be able to effect a settlement which will put a stop to the feud so far as his own family is concerned. I see no reason, therefore, why the Chief should not proceed to negotiate with the. tribe througrh Sheikh Ahmed, but I do not propose to suggest this course to him until I receive your further instructions in the matter.' 492. As regards the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of Colonel Kemball's letter No. 4-S A., dated 6th June, the Secretary of State was asked (telegram dated the 6th October 1902) :— ' Have you any objection to Sheikh of Bahrein bein&lt;? authorized to negotiate with Behaih tribe through SV.eikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Ka J ar? This seems to he only means of gaining redress short of allowing Sheikh to seek his revenge hy force' 493. It would be well to quote here Lord Ourzon's note dated the 12th May 1902, on which the sentence italicised is based— ' We have wasted 12 years in futile efforts to get the Portej or the Wali, or ;th0 Kaimmakam to make amends. No Turk ever makes amends unless he is forced to. The Sublime Porte announces that every effort will be made to arrest the cull rits Yes j and all the efforts will be unsuccessful. We know the game well. If the Sheikh is willing to com promise for pecuniary compensation, well and good. It' not, I cannot see why we ehould not let him take action, provided he is strong enough to do it effectually.' 494. There was only one difficulty, the Government of India thought, in the way of the suggestion to negotiate a settle- ibid. Nos, 129 and 131. ment through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, namely, that if it were adopted, it might lead to complications in connection with the recommendation made by Colonel Kemball, in regard to the desire of the Sheikh to come under British protection. Colonel Ketnball however thought that no such difficulty need be apprehended. 495. The Secretary of State too saw no objections to the proposed negotia tions. The Chief of Bahrein was accord- ihid. Nos. 136 and 137. ingly authorized to negotiate direct with the Behaih tribe, through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katar. 496. In despatch of the Secretary of State, No. 24-(Secret), dated 6th June 1902, attention was also drawn to an Illd ' N0, 127, opinion expressed by the Turkish Miaister Ihid. No. 127. Enclosure 2, Sub-enclosure 2. to Sir O'Conorto the effect that—• ' As a matter of fact the whole affair is the consequence of the murder of Sheikh Rashid- bin-Mekaiarikh by the Dowasir tribe and is the usual vendetta to which the tribes always resort on this occasion, it is the Bahreinese who have be^n the cause of the occurrence ; without appealing to the Government, they ought not to have gone shooting in that distiict.' 497. On this point, Mr. Gaskin reported Ihid. No. 131. Enclosure. (iettcr No. 178,dated 2ith August 1902):— ^ In 1898, four Amamerah tribesmen accompanied a party of Dawasirs to Thahran to hunt and the two parties went down the coast below Ojair where the Amamerah separated to o-o after gazelle, and were attacked by four Bahaih Arabs who killed one of them named Abdullah-bin -Mahomed and wounded two named Mahom d and R.ashid ; sons of Majid, and took their rifles. In the following year the two sons of Majid mentioned above and another named Gaith-bin-Rashid of th6 same tribe crossed over with two others to hunt and to look out for any Bahaih tribpsmen, and they fell in with some grazing camels attended by a young son of Sheikh Rashid-bin -Magarih Sheikh of Bahaih, and they took the opportunity to kill the boy in the place of Abdullah-bin -Mahom-d. It will be seen from these tacts that the Dawasir have no blood-feud with the Bahaih to adjust. After the assassination of the son of Sheikh Kashid, the latter came over to Bahrein and made a settlement wi -h Sheikh Hamid, the eldest son of the Chief of Bahrein, to put a^ide all further hostilities between him and the Amamerahs. ' No Amamerahs accompanied Slieikh Selman on the hunting expedition which proved so disastrous to himself and bis followers ; and the fact that the camp o. the Dawasirs which182 was close to his wns not attacked by the Baliaih shows that the latter's object was not the Dawasir's. The Amaraerahs are a distinct tribe, and have no connectim whatever with the Dawasirs, and live in a separate village near the Davvasirs at Bidaa on the north west corner of the Island of Bahrein. 'Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Hassan, the Chief of Da wasii-j was not killed in the attack on Sheikh Selman, but another Dawasir. Sheikh Abdullah is still alive, and is personally known tome. The Dawasirs are subjects of the Chief of Bahrein. Rashid-bin-Meganh^ the Chief of Bahaih, and his second son and a Bahaih tribesmen only were killed by a slave of Sheikh Selman in the attack on the latter and his party, and not thirteen persons as stated by the Turkish Minister of the Interior. The Morra, Ajman, and two Beni Hajir, companions who went with Sheikh Selman and lost their lives in the attack, were killed by the Bahaih and therefore must not be included in the number of the persons killed by the party attacked! ' There was no connection whatever betwpen the party of the late Sheikh Selman and that of the Dawasir tribe The simultanpous crossing of the two parties to the mainlaud wa» a mere co-incidence, as that is the usual season for such parties to cross over for the nuroose of hawking the ' hubara.' 'It will be observed that the Bahaih were the original aggressors against the Amamerahs whose blood-feud was finally settled amicably, and subsequently the Bahaih without any cause attacked the late Shaikh Selman and his party starting a fresh blood-feud. As explained * m the previous correspondence, according to triual custom, it is only the section of the tribe, a member of which sheds blood is responsible, and not the inhabitants of a whole district as it would seem the Turkish Minister desires to imply. In this case the Dahaih assassinated ^4 persons belonging to Bahrein, and if a balance is struck, there are 21 lives to be accounted for by the Bahaih, but the Bahaih being undoubtedly the aggressors, it seems contrary to justice to allow any deductnn being made when settling the matter. The Chief of Bahrein tells me that he cannot accept blood-money for tha lives of the three members of his family ; and, if peace is to be established between him and Bahaih, the only means to be adopted are those mentioned in the third paragraph of my letter No. 109, dated the 17th May 1902. As Sheikh Ahmed-bin-'lhani would be acting as a peacemaker between the two parties. I do not see what complications can arise in the future.' 498. On 18th. August.1903, Colonel Kemball reported that the negotia- Secrct e., September 1904, Nos. 56 87. (No. 56.) attempted through Sheikh Ahmed had proved abortive, and suggested as the only alternative that His Majesty's Government should clearly inform the Turkish Government that if satisfaction were not given within a definite period, the Chief of Bahrein would be permitted to take his own steps to obtain satisfaction. The satisfaction demanded by the Sheikh, as noted above includes the payment of a sum of Rs. 35,140, as blood-money and compensation for property plundered and the surrender of three of the three persons impli cated for execution or possible pardon. 499. In telegraphing the purport of Colonel Kemball's report (telegram ibid. No. 57. dated 13th September 1903), the Viceroy expressed concurrence with Colonel Kem ball, suggested that satisfaction should be demanded within two months The Secretary of State replied on 3rd iNovember ly03 :— ' Sir N. O'Conor has caused the Porte to telegraph instructions to Basrah asking for an Hid. No. 59. re P or ^ on present position with regard . • i tt , i.t a . an d stating that full redress for the murders is reqmred. He suggests that before allowing the Sheikh of Bahrein to take th • matter into his own hands, a reasonable time should be allowed for an answer.^ 500. Then followed the Secretary of State's despatch No. 11 (Secret), dated Ibid. No. 69. 19th Tebruary 1904, which forwarded the correspondence between the Foreign Office and the India Office and Sir N, O'Conor. It appeared from it that Sir N'Conor bad insisted on reparation being made by payment of blood -money as suo- gested by Colonel Kemball. The Minister of the Interior stated in reply tha* it would be impossible to exact such a large sum from the delinquent tribes especially nomadic as they were. Nevertheless the Minister communicated by telegram the substance of Sir N. O'Conor's note and instructed him to take action accordingly, and Sir N. OTonor undertook to recommend His Majesty's Government to let matters stand until a reasonable time had elapsed ' durino- which the Vali could endeavour to execute the fresh orders sent to him. ' Sir133 N. O'Conor also wished to know the names of the persons who had committed the murder. The Secretary of State observed :— ' In the event of the Turkish Government failing to obtain payment of an adequate compensation or of their resorting to further procrastination, His Majesty's Government are prepared to agree to the Sheikh of Bahrein heing allowed to exact reparation for himself from the Behaih. In this event, however, it would he necessary to take precautions to avoid raising as far as possible, the question of Turkish sovereignty in these regions, and it would he desirable to inform the Sheikh that he must on no account proceed against the JBehaih, while they were in the interior within Turkish jurisdiction' 501. This despatch of the Secretary of State was sent to the Political im No 70 * Ecsident for necessary action, but the portion italicised was not to be communi cated to the Chief of Bahrein, as the status of the Agency and of the arrange ments to be made for the customs administration in Bahrein were under con sideration. 502. There was then further correspondence between the Foreign Office lbid No 73 and Sir K O'Conor, which was forwarded to us with the Secretary of State's despatch No. 16, dated 1st April 1904. From this it appeared that according to the account given by the Turkish Government, a number of the offending tribe, probably including those responsible for the murder, had been killed in an encounter with the Turkish forces. The Turkish Officers were reported to have been unable to obtain compensation from the Behaih tribe. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government decided to instruct Sir N. O'Conor to inform the Forte that as they have been unable to obtain compensation from the Behaih, His Majesty's Government can no longer dissuade Sheikh of Bahrein from taking his own measures, but that they will use their best efforts to ensure that he. shall take no action as long as the Behaih are in territory recognized as Turkish. ^ No 76 Sir N. O'Conor was instructed accordingly in the Foreign Office despatch No. 132, dated 12th April 1904. 603. As regards the last proviso in these instructions it was ascertained lad n o. 83. r d /?p?;; te T d P ( ? (t 2 les 1 r . am dated 14th June 1904) that the offending tribe had never left the territory of Masa and Katar and was then in the latter district. 504 Major Cox also submitted Mr. Gaskin's report regarding the persons „ Q , „ , concerned in the murder and such of them Ibid $o.8o.

The other members of the raiding party were Behaih tribesmen whose names have not yet been procured. As regards the persons mentioned in the communication from the Porte to His Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople, I would ventnrp to report that the only member of the Mekarih family killed by the Turks since the murder was Ibn Retaiban, a nephew of Rashid-bin Mekarih, on the 10th September 1902 at Zarnooga about l-A miles south of Hofuf. This youth was not concerned in the outrage. Ali-bin-MonaJdb was a Behaih tribesmen and was killed in the first week of October 1902, in the incident mentioned in the entry dated 13th October in this Office diary for 18th October 1902. These two men were not concerned in the attack at Tinofa. Ibn Ketifa is also a Behaihi and is known to be alive and is with his tribe. Mahomed-bin-Nejdan, Hassan Cheiimet and Toritor do not appear to be known as having been members of the Behaih tribe. Though the actual number of the attacking party is unknown, it is generally stated that it was composed of over [0967FD]134 fifty persons. The fact that two of the leaders were killed in the attack and possibly five tribesmen may have been subsequently killed in skirmishes with Turkish troops despatched in connection with cases entirely disconnected with the murder of Sheikh Selman, and his followers, I cannot see how the Behaih can be considered as exonerated by the Porte since four of the leaders in the attack and over forty tribesmen are still at large. The connection of the Governor of Nejd to the effect that the crime was due to the animosity existing between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Behaih tribe is erroneous as will be seen from the date of the case set forth in my letters No. 219, dated I2th December 1900, and No. 9, dated 27th January 1901. With reference to the question of compensation, it is hoped that the fact that the Rs, 35,140 represent blood-money for the lives of only 21 victims and the value of the camels, arms, and camp equipment taken by the Behaih and that the Turks will still have to execute three'of the principal men concerned in satisfaction of the lives of Sheikh Selman, his son Diaij, and his nephew Abdulrahman-bin-Rashid, for whose murder the Chief cannot accept compensation as pointed out in my letters Nos. 98 and 109, dated the brd and 17tb May 1902 respectively, will not be overlooked. I may mention that the Behaih Arabs are a sub-division of the Morra Arabs, and are not powerful enough to separate themselves from the main tribe and to go into the desert of JMejd for the reason that they would be soon exterminated by thp large tribes in that district and consequently they have never been beyond the limits of Hasa or Katar and now the tribe is encamped at Salwa on the western border of Katar. The statement that the tribe has fled into the desert of Nejd is fabricated with a view to cover the inactivity of the Hasa authorities. 1 have duly warned the Chief to take no independent action in the matter/' 505. In forwarding copies of reports received from the Gulf, the Govern ment of India observed in despatch No. ihxd No. 87. dated 11th August 1904 :— From the details now furnishefl, it will be observed that the persons reported, by the 'Wali of Basrah, to have been killed in a fight at Zernaka between the Turkish Convoy and Bin Mekiriah and his companions, were not those actually concerned in the murder of Sheikh Selman and his followers; and that the real perpetraters of the outrage are still at lar^e, and presumably within Turkish jurisdiction. The contention of the Governor of Nejd that the murder was the outcome of animosity is also refuted. In view of the attitude adopted by Sheikh Tsa in refusing to accept our advice in regard to the administration of his Customs revenues, we have deemed it advisable to withhold for the present from the Chief any intimation regarding the concession which His Majesty's Govern ment are prepared to make to him in the matter of avenging himself on his enemies on the mainland, and we intend, with your approval, to make no communication to him on the subject pending the receipt of the order of His Majesty's Government on the proposals put forward in our Secret despatch No. 85, dated the 21st April 1904, for a revision of the arrangements for British representation at Manama. If there is likely to be delay in the issue of these ordprs, we would sugest that, in order to prevent the possibility of the Sheikh's case being prejudiced by delay, the fact of the murderers being still at large, and in Turkish territory apparently, might be brought to the notice of the Porte. As the Sheikh is precluded from proceeding against them while in that territory, the advisability of again pressing for the payment of pecuniary compensation might also be considered.' 506. Copy of this despatch has been forwarded by His Majesty's Government to Sir N.' O'Conor with the following instructions • ' The information obtained by the Officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf is to the effect that the persons who were reported by the Turkish Government in February last to have been killed in an encounter with Turkish troops were not those actually concerned in the outrage, but that, on the contrary, the offenders are still at large in Turkish territory. In view of the continued failure of the Turkish Government to exact any reparation for the murders, there seems no reason for further delaying the representation which ifour Excel lency was instructed to make in my despatch* No. • Vide para. 502 ante. 0 £ ^ l as ^ ail( [ w hich was fco the effect that His Majesty's Government can no longer restrain the Sheikh of Bahrein from resorting to such steps as he may think necessary for the purpose, though they will use their ted endeavours to insure that he shall take no action against the Behaih as long as that tiibe remain in territory recognized as Turkish. I have accordingly to request that you will make the representation already proposed.135 CHAPTER TENTH. Turkish designs on Oman and the rest of East Arabian Littoral, 1888-1899. 507. We have dealt with several measures taken by the Turks to extend &gt; their dominion on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, their expeditions into Nejd, their increase of their naval and military forces, etc. We shall now note a few more of their actions, which disclose their designs towards that object. 607A. The Turks have always cast longing glances on Oman. In 1888 there rww o/o»»»,«8s. were persistent rumours of a threatened External a ., September 1888, Nos. 127-129. invasion ot Oman by Ibn Hashid in con- if.:™! 1: SVsKSV with Sheikh Jasim ot Katar and External a., February 1889, Nos. 347-357. Under the auspices of the Porte. External A., May 1889, Nos. 69-81. Representations were made to the Porte in the matter, and the Porte External a ., July 1889, Nos. 235-239. denied that there were any communica tions between Ibn Rashid and the Sultan, except exchange of presents. From the British Ambassador—Sir W. White's letter, dated 9th May 1^89, it appears that Ibn Rashid was anxious to secure from the Sultan jurisdiction over Hasa, while the Sultan was desirous of secur ing a greater hold over Nejd and Sliammar. Both these purposes could not be attained having regard to the facts that the Porte's policy was to extend its jurisdiction over the Arab littoral, and the ambition of Ibn Rashid to be practically independent ruler, only nominally acknowledging suzerainty of the Sultan. 508. The Turkish Government have always assumed the role of the Protec tor of pilgrims to Mecca. One of the pil- S:lTXXSt^-io' n ' a ' grira rou'esbeingfrorn Hasa by way of Hofuf, the Turkish Governor of Hasa has been always at pains to undertake the protection of pilgrims on this route. For this purpose a temporary Amir was once appointed to control the traffic and given the privilege of bearing the sacred standard on the way. In one instance in 1888, the Mutassarif of Hasa went so far as to address a very insolent letter to the Chief of Bahrein ordering in peremptory terms to notify the appoint ment of the temporary Amir, and the date by which the pilgrims should arrive at Hasa to accompany him, etc. 509. In 1892, some men of the Monasir tribe, aided by people belonging to JPlunder ly the Monasir trite in Hasa, 1892.

Nos. 118 -119. ^ ^ mutassarif of ^ ^ of Basrah then wrote to the Chief of Abu Thabi, in a threatening tone, charging him with responsibility for the acts. The Chief replied disavowing all connection with the Monasir tribe. The Political Resident Colonel Talbot thought that though this tribe were said to be more or less under the control of the Abu Thabi Chief, he could not be held responsible for the acts of so scattered a tribe some 400 miles from Abu Thabi. What Colonel Talbot objected to was the threatening tone of the letters addressed by the Turkish authorities to the Sheikh. Should they adopt a similar tone again, he suggested that the true position of the Chief in relation to the British Government should be pointed out to the Porte. He also advised the Chief that in future he should consult the Resident before replying to such letters, an advice which the Chief accepted. 510. In 1893 we received reports from various sources of attempts made TurJcish detigns to secure a larger hold over the Idte to adopt a Comprehensive Arabia. scheme to bring the Chieftains in Arabia Ullder Turkish B control and t0 c]ieck their rebellious spirit. One of the schemes was to appoint a Civil Governor for the whole of Arabia, in which should be included Maskat and the rest of Oman (including the Pirate Chiefs) Bahrein and Hasa. Secret agents were deputed to induce the Chieftains to visit the capital, Constantinople, and to counteract the growing influence of the British.136 511. It was probably with this object in view that the Porte was anxious to . -.-l m ■ i n-* - ascertain the exact terms of the relationship Agreement with Trucial Chiefs communicated to . , rr , • i m • j' x i *ai the Forte. m which the Truoial Chiefs stood with us. 512.

It was thereupon decided by Her Majesty's Government that the text of the agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs on the Pirate Coast of the Persian Gulf should be communicated to the Turkish Government. 513. In 1899, we find the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf arousing an Uneasy interest on Arabian affairs, 1899. Uneasy interest in Turkish circles. Hamdi secret e., february 1900, nos. 40-41. Pasha, the Vali of Basrah, was for pursu ing an aggressive policy in Hasa and at Koweit, one of his schemes being the extension of the telegraphic line from Eao to Katif, which would pass through Koweit. An Irade was actually issued by the Sultan to carry out this project. It was however given up by his successor Mohsin Pasha. 613A. The Porte at this time appears to have been alarmed at the news of a deputation of the Amir of Nejd being on Secret E., February 1900, Nos. 40-41. itB w ay to the Khedive of Egypt, ' with presents and dangerous advice.' The Vali of Basrah was ordered to be on the look out for these messengers and to arrest them if found. What the Porte probably feared was the extension of the British influence in Arabia from the direction of Egypt. 513B. At an International Sanitary Conference held at Paris in 1894, it was resolved, among other measures, to establish certain sanitary posts in the Persian Gulf^and to give certain powers to the Sanitary Board at Constantinople, which the Turks soon utilized to extent their influence in the Gulf. Annexe III (ii) of the convention. Sanitary posts to be established. 1. At Eao, or near this point, a large lazeretto on terra firma, with a complete sanitary establishment having under its control the sanitary posts in the Persian Gulf mentioned below :— 2. A small lazeretto in one of the two islets, Ottoman Selhiye or Yilaniye, situated near Basrah, to supervise such individuals as may have evaded the visit to Eao. 3. Maintenance of the sanitary post actually existing at Basrah. 4. Establishment of four sanitary posts in the Bay of Koweit. 5. Sanitary post at Menama, capital of the Bahrein Islands. 6. Sanitary post at Bander-Abbas. 7. Sanitary post at Bander Bouchir. 8. Sanitary post at Mohammerah. 9. Sanitary post in the port of Gwadur (Baluchistan). 10. Sanitary post in the port of Maskat (on the Oman Coast). 513-0. There were also made regulations, which would give occasion for vexatious interference with the British ibid No. 27. Indian commerce. The Eoreign Office therefore refused to accept the arrangements proposed for the Persian Gulf. 513-D. The Government of India, who were asked to state their opinion after consulting the British Officers and firms in the Gulf, expressed the fol lowing views in there Despatch No. 22 (Secret), dated 3rd January 1895 :— ' For some time past a quarantine station has existed at Fao, and, as the information in our possession shows, under cover of quarantine and customs regulations, Turkish officials are enabled to board Indian native craft bound to and coming from Mohammerab and to levy137 ac crrmil. W e do not doubt that, if a lazaret were also established there, the extortions to which native craft are now subjected, would be more freely practised, and probably extenied to \essels 01 greater burthen, so that the inconvenience and loss inflicted by delay at Fao would fall more heavily on British trade. It lias also been represented that delay at Fao might involve the loss of one of the fortnightly tides needed by large steamers in crossing the bar, and if m consequence it became necessary to tranship into lighters, the loading and unloadino- would entail heavy expenditure. The objections we entertain to the proposals of the Conference are no less serious in view of the political considerations involved. The pretensions of the Porte to sovereignty over Balirein, its claiwi to \loha,tnineTah as evidenced by the levy of dues on its imports and expoTts, and the jealousy evinced by the Turkish Government of the position of Great Britain on the Persian Gulf, render it especially inexpedient that Turkish, officials should he allowed, under the pretext of enforcing quarantine regulations, to interfere in the affairs of Arab tribes under the influence, of Her Majesty's Government. It will be observed moreover from the letter cited in . From Major Hayes Sadler, dated 9th October 1894, the margin that His Highness the Sultan of m Enclosure No. y. Maskat would object to sanitary posts at Gwadur and Maskat, and if this portion of the scheme were left unexecuted, the object with which the measures have been proposed would be defeated. Similar considerations apply to Fao. The position of this place at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab would render these quarantine measures ineffective without the assent and co-operation of Persia. It would be contrary to the pro vision of the capitulations and of the treaty of Erzeroom for the sanitary establishment at Fao to control the movement of British and Persian ships bound for any place on the Persian side of the stream. Such control would amount to exercise of sovereignty over the entire Shat- el-Arab to the detriment of Persian rights and of our traffic with Basrah. Not improbably, as has bf-en pointed out in the course of the correspondence, the assertion of such a claim is the real object of the Ottoman Government in its desire to establish a lazaret at Fao. 513-E. When the plague broke out in India at the close of the year Secret i, March 1897, Nos. 87-126. 1896, the Sanitary Board at Constanti- secret i, Apni 1897, so. 8. nople decided in February 1897, to estab lish quarantine stations on the Arabian coast at Katif, Bahrein, Katar and Koweit. The Political Resident in the Gulf anticipated these measures by establishing quarantine at Bahrein. As to Katif, no objection could be raised, as it was, held to be in Turkish territory. Koweit was thought to be 'doubtful,' while Turkish pretensions to Katar had been always denied by us. Her Majesty's Government accordingly decided that Turkish intervention, even, on the pretext of sanitary precautions, should not be permitted either on the Katar coast or at Bahrein or at Koweit. 513-r. Nevertheless a Turkish quarantine post was established at Koweit, the vexatious acts of interference of which are treatad in the Koweit Precis, [C967rD]138 CHAPTER ELEVENTH. Summary of British declarations against Turkish encroachments in the Persian Gulf and of the Porte's assurances, 1871-1904. 514. With reference to the designs of Turkey to establish a supremacy oyer Bahrein, the Bombay Gouernment in 1847 informed the Resident that Bahrein Precis naee 4 is obviously desireable to exclude (IS much as possible all interference, by foreign powers, in the affairs of the Persian Gulf, since it is only by retaining the supreme authority in its own hands that the British Government can hope to secure the permanpnce of the objects it has gained in that quarter at such a large expense.' (Letter No. 337, dated 31st July 1847.) The Board of Directors agreed with the Bomboy Governments in thinking that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British naval force in that Gulf, and ice authorize you to inform Major Rennel {the Mesideni) accordingly ' (Despatch dated 6th October 1904). 5i4-A. In 1861, the Turkish Governor General of Baghdad wanted to know by what right we have had bombarded Daraaum, a place which, as lying within the territory of ' I'eysal Beg, the Eaimmakam of Nejd,' was ' part of Turkish protest against British proceedings in the hereditary doroinians of the Sultan.' 1861, paragraph 45 ante. To wllich Her Britannic Majesty's Consul- General at Baghdad replied that we had hitherto ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Fey sal as well as with all the Chief's and Principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf; that our pacific policy in the Gulf ims well known, and that in the prosecution of that policy we had never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State—an authority or jurisdiction, moreover which assuredly the. Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter' In reporting this correspondence to Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople the Consul-General wrote as follows Although it may not be detained that, since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40, Jmir Fey sal has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an ofienng to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Forie has never exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority over that cuuntry. 614-B. We had then to deal with the Turkish expedition in April 1871. Colonel Felly, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, was told that if the Arabs took part in the quarrel (between the Turks and the Wahabis) he should limit his action strictly to maintaining the maritime peace. He then enquired whether the Government of India desired him to use any influence towards preventing the Trucial Chiefs from aiding the Wahabis against the Turks, or in any way moving by sea, and what reply he should give to the Trucial Chiefs if, while continuing to observe the maritime peace, they asked whether the British Go'/eminent would protect them against an attack from the Turks by sea. Colonel Pelly also suggested that it would be advisable to intimate to the Turkish authorities our engagements with the Trucial Chiefs, as it was suspect ed the Turks might have an eye on Bahrein. 515. On 25th April 1871— ' Colonel Herbert reported a rumour that if the expedition to Nejd was successful, it would eventually be directed to the acquisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the Arab coast.'' 516. On 28th April Colonel Herbert again telegraphed as follows :— ' Ambassador telegraphs repeatedly at my request the following: 4 1 have positive assurances from the Ottoman Porte that they intend establishing supremacy over bahrein, AIaskat } and independent tribes of Soutfiern Arabia, and that no special attack is contemplated against them V 517. Colonel Herbert's telegram of the 25th regarding the rumoured inten tions of the expedition was reported cn the 28th to the Secretary of State, who was asked w r hether an assurance oouid not be obtained from the Turkish Gov ernment that the expedition had no other object than the settlement of the affairs of Nejd. The Secretary of State replied :— ' Her Majesty 's Government have received assurances from Constantinople that Turkish Government have no such designs as those mentioned'*139 TT i ^ up e discre P ai ioy between the information received from ^ s Government and that received from the Political A^ent at ±&gt;ugndad, Her Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople was immediatelv com municated with by telegraph, both direct and through Colonel Herbert. Tbe result of this reference was that Sir H. Elliot telegraphed on the 32th May: ' TI ib Ottoman Porte explicitly denies all intention of extending supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tnbes of Southern Arabia, and contemplates no attack against them. The sole object of Ue expedition is declared to be the restoration in Nei'd of the tranquillity which is disturbed by the hostility of the brothers, Abdullah and Saud.' 519. The Grand Vizier communicated these assurances through M. Pisani to Sir H. Elliot;— Your Excellency, said All Pasha, may give the most positive assurances to Her Maieafy'a Cjovernment that the Porte entertains no intention whatever of obtaining supremacu over Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tnbes of Southern Arabia, and does not contemplate anv attack upon them, or harbour any dengn to subdue them. He anerU that the true and sole object of the present enterprise is to pnify the two brothers, to prevent the prrtraetion of disorder, and to restore tranquillity' J 520. Midhut Pasha then at Baghdad also communicated to Colonel Herbert the assurances of the Porte. These assurances enabled the Government of India to give on the 17th May the much required instructions to Colonel PeUy, to communicate the substance of Sir H. Elliot's message to the Chief of Bahrein and those of the Trucial Chiefs who had made enquiries regarding the object of Turkish expedition. 521. With regard to the general questions put by Colonel Pelly it was said:— ' He should be informed that it is impossible for His Excellency in Council to crive mstructmns regrard.ng contingencies of the occurrence of which there is no immediate prospect The Turkish expe^tton however innowayaffects the Treaty rights and obligations, either of the British Government or of the Chiefs who have subscribed to the maritime peace Colonel Pelly may so inform the Chiefs who have consulted him, and should use all legitimate means to maintain the stipulations of the treaties.' 522. Colonel Pelly having enquired whether tribes, who are parties to the maritime truce, should be allowed to undertake operations by sea in the interest of either party, he was told on the 30th May to go to Bahrein and there assure the Chief of the assurances given by the Porte; to inform him that so long as he observed conditions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty, our obligations would be fulfilled; to inform all the Chiefs, trucial and others, that the Turkish Gov ernment contemplated no attack on them and had no intention to obtain supremacy over any independent State. 523. With reference to Colonel Pelly's enquiry regarding Trucial Chiefs the Secretary of State was asked :— ' ' « If Pelly asks whether he is to stop by force any military operations by sea on part of Chiefs, either for or against Turks, am I to authorize hira to d) so ? i advise this course, and that you should infer n Turkish (xovernment accordingly. This will not include Koweit Chiefs' who iiave already sailed.' 524. The Secretary of State replied ' Persian Gulf Trucial Chiefs may be interdicted from maritime operations, but no others.' 525. Thereupon the Bombay Government were directed to inform Colonel Pelly accordingly, and to instruct him to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. 526. The instructions given to Colonel Pelly having been communicated to the Porte, Ali Pasha expressed his thanks for the communication ; in un equivocal terms repeated his assurances that the Porte contemplated no naval operations, and said that it had no intention of applying for assistance to any of the Chiefs included in the maritime truce. At the same time the Porte having no cognizance of the truce could not be expected to be held bound by it, and would not hesitate to accept the services of any of the Chiefs who might tender theni,140 &lt;5 527. Midhut Paslia also again asserted that Bahrein was not within Turk-' ish contemplation, and assured Colonel Herbert that his orders to the Officer Commanding the expedition were on no account to turn his eyes on Bahrein. 528. Sir H. Elliot wroto in September 1871 that he had made Ali Pasha understand thai Her Majesty's Government would not see with indilference any attempt to disturb the arrangements existing with regard to the Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf. 52). Again in February 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded papers c t ™ i o*■*o xt m qo received from Constantinople. Server Proceed,ng.. Secret. M. y 18 , 2 , Nos. 52.88. ^ tllat Her Majesty's Government might rest assured that the policy followed previously by the Porte towards the independent tribes along the Persian Gulf had under gone no alteration whatever, and His Excellency asserted again on the part of the Porte that no intention was ever entertained, nor any design harboured, to subdue those tribes or obtain any supremacy over them. The sole object of the Nejd expedition he stated to have been, and still to be, to restore order and tranquillity there, and establish a regular and cohesive administration more in conformity with the requirements of the country. 530. In April 1872 the Bombay Government wrote that they attached no Proceedings, secret. Ma, 1872, No. 77. importance to 11,6 assurances of the Turk- ish Government as reported in the papers received from Constantinople, as there was no information as to what tribes in the Persian Gulf would be considered by them to be independent, or what they considered to be the limits of the Kingdom of Nejd. The Government of Bombay thought that some specific declaration as to what the claims were should be at once obtained. The Government of India replied that the assur ances repeatedly given by the Turkish Government, to the effect that they had no intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the other inde pendent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, were accepted as satisfactory and that it was not considered expedient or likely to lead to any good result to ask for a specific declaration of the claims of the Turkish Government. 531. The policy of Her Majesty's Government was laid down in the follow ing despatch, dated 9th May 1872, addressed to the British Ambassador at Constantinople:— ' I have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the Government of India respectinc? the proceedings of the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf, more especially with reference to the increase which the Forte has recently made in the number of vessels employed in those waters. Her Majesty's Government, however, consider that as long as Turkey is engaged in upholding its legitimate authority in the Gulf, they cannot ask it to curtailthe means which it considers necessary for doing so, but they may fairly say to the Porte that they trust and expect that no attempt will be made to extend that authority, which would raise questions between the Indian Government and the Porte, the maintenance of the existing state of things in the Gulf and on its borders being considered a matter of great importance to the general tranquillity of those quarters; and that the presence of lar^e Turkish armaments is generally calculated to disquiet the bordering: countries, and must necessarily cause o| the British Uovern- ment to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. If the presence of an excessive Turkish force requires the Indian Government to increase the British force in the Gulf the native mind will see in the latter an encouragement, not only to resist, but to thwart the Porte, and things will go on from bud to worse, till at last, even in the admitted Turkish districts, a general feeling of uneasiness will he produced, and will cost the Porte more to subdue or mitigate than the country is worth. I have, therefore, to instruct Your Lordship, while expressing to the Porte the views of Her Majesty's Government on this point, to state that they will gladly use their good offices to restore peace and bring matters to a normal state of tranquillity.' 532. This despatch was duly communicated to Server Pasha in June 1872, and he repeated the assurance, already so often given, of the absence of all in tention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government might be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations.141 533. The question of Tarksh jurisdiction on the Arabian Coast of the Persian came particularly under the consideration of the Government in 1879. The question was the line of demarcation of the Turkish sphere of territorial jurisdiction on that coast and the nature of the responsibilities which should devolve on the two Governments. On these points in their despatch No. 1^9, dated llth July 1878, the Government of India recommended that from JBasrah to Ojoir the authority of the Porte should he recognized as established* on land, hut at sea the British Government should continue to exercise some concurrent protectorate pursuing pirates if necessary into Turkish waters and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits through the Resident in the Gulf; that south or east of Ojair, Turkish authority should not be recognized except at Bidaa on the Katar Peninsula; and that the Porte should be required («) to stipulate not to interfere, either on the coast or in the islands with the Trucial Chiefs between Odeid and Has- ul-Khima; yh) to recognize the territories of the Sheikh of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain ; and (c) in case of piracies from within its jurisdiction, to enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of compensation. 534. There passed upon this despatch correspondence between the India 1880&lt; and Foreign Offices which was forwarded Pol. a., May 1880, No. is, sir Mullet's letter, to the Government of India with Secre- dated 27ch September 1880. ^ ^ ^ of ^ , s de , p , tcll Nr&gt; ^ dated ^ November 1880 The view to which the Secretary of State for India (Lord Cranbrook) was inclined was :— ' The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it is to le defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at any point north of Ojair, which is opposite the southern extremity of the island of Bahrein-, but it is precisely betuem that spot and Kafif that since the settlement of the Beni Yas at Odied was broken up in 1878, the operations of the pirat'caL tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity.' His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognizing any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish, aud as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would be the formation of an asylum which would be taken, advantage of by marauder a in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would he unable to control without a considerable and permanent increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, which the Porte has declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on political grounds. 'The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cranbrook is led is th&amp;t negotiation or discus- iion with the Forte on the territorial question should be avoided] but that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Governmeut of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce may be efficiently fulfilled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt alt necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the teas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by individual Chiefs, such as the Sheikh of Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points.' 535. In continuation of his despatch No. 40, dated 6th November 1879, referred to above, the Secretary of State 0 ' ' 5 ay » 0 - • j n despatch No. 4 (Secret) of 29th January 1880, forwarded further correspondence on the subject between the India and Eoreign Offices. In a confidential communication regarding these papers, Her Majesty's Ambassador (Sir H. Layard) was instructed by the Foreign Office, London, that wherever Turkish authority was at that time actually and firmly established upon the coast, Her Majesty's Government would be ready to recognize it and would be glad to see it accompanied by a regular and civilized administration. He was also directed to press upon the Porte the advisability of allowing British ships—while pursuing their opera tions against piratical vessels outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid—to pursue and capture them within the three mile limit of that part of the coast. Purther as regards Maskat, Bahrein, and the possession of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and Uas-el-Khyma inclusive, Her Majesty s Government, while they considered it unnecessary to seek for any formal declaration from the Porte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those two territories, were in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of [C967FD] z11142 thes3 claims, and considered themselves hound hy their treaty engagements with their several Chiefs to resist any attempt, whether direct or indirect, to give them practical eftect. 536. la July 1880 Her Majasty's Ambassador at CoDstantinople (Mr. Goschen) issued a note to the Governor-General at Basrhdad drawing his atten tion to the increase of practical expeditions in the Persian Gulf issuing from that side of the Arabian littoral, where the Turkish Government claimed to have established jurisdiction, and asking his co-operation in a plan of opera tions for the suppression of the piracies north of Odeid. Mr. Goschen's pro ceedings were approved, but he was warned not to entangle himself in any discussion with the Porte about the territorial question. 537. As no arrangement could be arrived at with either the Porte as the Porte of Baghdad, Her Majesty's Government ultimately decided that our naval officers should not he hampered by the three mile limit in pursuing the pirated craft in Turkish waters. 538. The practical outcome of the correspondence and discussions of the two vears was (see Mr. Moore's memoran- 1881 ' dum of 1881.)

The Sheikh of El Bidaa on the eastern side of the El Katr peninsula an independent Chief and not party to the maritime truce, has allowed the Turks to maintain a small military post there since 1872, and Her Majesty's Government have never protested against this assertion of Turkish supremacy on this portion of the £1 Katr Coast. Lord Cross thinks that it may be sufficient for the present to acquaint Sir W. White, if the Marquis of Salisbury sees no objection thereto, that Her Majesty's (government do not consider that the Forte is in effective occupation of the Arabian coast beyond Katif y and that they adhere to the declaration made in 1883, that the claims * of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the A1 Katar Coast is not admitted by Her Majesty's Government, but as there is no reason to anticipate that any practical result would be attained by provoking a discussion with the Turkish Government as to the extent of its juri^diotion on that coast, it is undesirable to raise the question at the present time. * * ' {( * Has Tanurah is the south point of a long strip of land * * which form? the north side of Katif Bay.

In his letter No. 153 of the 23rd April 1893, the British Ambassador at Constantinople informed the London Office that— u In the course of a conversation which I held with Said Pasha yesterday, I clearly pointed out to him that Her Majesty's Governmentj whilst admitting the aover- eignty of the Sultan extended from Bussorah to a place called El Katif, consider ed that the coast running south of that place was looked upon as debatable land, and I stated that Her Majesty's Government had entered into arrange ments with the Native Chiefs along that coast by which it was established that disputes arising there were to be referred for settlement to the British Kesident at Bushire * * * 547. In their despatch No. 141, Secret E of the 21st July 1893, the Gov ernment of India wrote to the Secretary of State for India— No. 229 of Secret E., July 1893, Nos. 124-231. No. 38 of Secret B., January 1894, Nog. 14-43, ' Your Lordship is already aware that the Ottoman Porte has of late distinctly asserted its claims to sovereignty over EI Katr, and we have now only to invite attention to the late proceedings of the local Turkish officials in forbidding Captain Streeten of Her Majesty's Ship Brisk from holding torpedo practice in the harbour of El Bidaa and in preventing our officers from visiting the shore. We take this opportunity of enquiring whether the policy laid down in 18s3 of denying Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr should be continued. The Government of India are not aware of any circumstance which would justify a departure from it in the present state of affairs in the peninsula. We would, therefore, recommend that the line of action hitherto adopted by Her Majesty's Government may continue to be followed j and we have, at the same time, the honour to state that the proceedings of the local Turkish authorities have caused and are still causing injury to the trade of Bahrein.' 548. The Secretary of State replied (despatch No. 35 of the 8th September 1893)— « * * * (2). As regards the recommendation of Your Excellency's Government that the policy of refusing to recognise Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr should be adhered to, Her Majesty's Government observe that the Turkish authorities, although they maintain a garrison at El Bidaa, appear to have practically no hold on the country. So long as they do not move beyond the limits of the town, the nominal suzerainty of the Porte is recognized; but any attempt to extend Turkish authority is resisted. There seems therefore to be no sufficient reason for allowing the pretensions of Turkey to interfere with our liberty of action, or to prevent Your Excellency s Govern ment from making suoh treaties with the Chiefs of El Katr as may be con sidered desirable. Her Majesty's Government maintain the policy hitherto followed, and continue to deny the claim of the Turkish Government to exercis^ sovereignty over t e El Katr Peninsula; but they do not think it necessary to make any communication on the subject to the Porte, unless the question is raised otncial- ly by the Turkish Government **■*.'
