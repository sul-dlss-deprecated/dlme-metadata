Letters report that in 1937 Shaikh Said of Kalba died and the people of Kalba elected his son Hamad, a boy of twelve, but the right of succession by the firstborn child was not recognized by other rulers. The succession was contested by the Shaikh of Dibba and also Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, ex-Shaikh of Sharjah. The file contains translations of letters between the Arab rulers of the coast relating to this issue. A letter from Hamad bin Sai'd bin Hamad to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah informs of his election and requests his protection. The Wali of Kalba writes to Sir Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that Shaikh Sultan bin Salim was attempting to influence the merchants of Kalba to gain the succession.The Residency Agent, Sharjah was dispatched to assess the situation; the file includes a family tree of Sharjah. In a letter to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, the Political Resident Persian Gulf noted the policy of the Government of India is one of non-interference and finally recognition as Shaikh of whoever can seize and hold the Shaikhship provided that they recognise the Treaties with His Majesty's Government entered into by their predecessor. The correspondence also notes that whilst uncertainty remained no Imperial Airways aircraft used the landing strip at Kalba.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Kalba, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sheikh of Dibba, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kalba</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Succession</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000104#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000104#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000104#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000104#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
