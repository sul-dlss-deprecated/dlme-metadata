It covers the question of Indian Mohammedan opinion, and the lack of Muslim representation of India in the Councils of the Empire; and argues against turning the Turks out of Constantinople as it would cause resentment in India and be viewed as an anti-Muslim action.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Constantinople</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002eb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
