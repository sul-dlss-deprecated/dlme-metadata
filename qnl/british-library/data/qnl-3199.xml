Would you please let me know as soon as convenient whether the India Office concur in the terms of the draft? the Foreign Office and a copy of this letter and its enclosures to Shackle at the Board of Trade. I am sending a copy of the draft to Dunbar at Yours sincerely J.P. GIBSON, ESQDowning Street, QRrU?T September, 1938• My dear High Commissioner, The questionB dealt with in your letter of the 18th August regarding the draft Treaty between the United Kingdom and Muscat have been carefully considered by the competent Departments of His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom and 1 am now in a position to communicate to you the views of His Majesty*s Government on the points raised. 2# The Articles of the draft Treaty to which Hie Majesty’s Government in the Union have called attention fall into two categories, namely, Articles 1, 20 and 21, which are general provisions of a type which it has been customary for many year© past to include in general Commercial Trestles negotiated on behalf of the United Kingdom and Articles 13, 14 and 15 which relate to the securing of special extra-territorialextra-territorial rights in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, and it will be convenient to deal separately with these two categories. 3. A® stated above, the Articles in the first category follow existing practice in regard to the drafting of Gofnmercial Treaties* This practice is based on the reeoiemendations contained in &amp; Report of the Drafting Committee of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1930 which were accepted by the representatives of the Governments / then present, except those of the Irish ij’ree State; a copy of the Report of the Committee is annexed for convenience of reference* Since that time Mis Majesty’s Government In the United Kingdom have included provisions based on the recommenda tions of the Report in all their arsft Commercial Treaties; recent examples may be found in the Commercial Treaty with Slam, signedslgraft on the 23rd !fovmber t 193? (Treaty Series Mo.33 (1938) - Cma.8731) and the coramereial treaty with the French and Tangier Tone© of Morocco, ©igned on the 18th July last (Cmd.&amp;823). 4* do far as Hi© Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom are aware, there is nothing either in the published conclusions or in the confidential record of discussions of the Imperial Conference of 1937 which expressly or by necessary implication , suggests that the recommendations of 1930 should be departed from and we therefore feel bound, in the absence of an indication that a change Is desired by all the Governments concerned, to adhere to the practice recommended in 1930. 8. X should add, as regards the proposed Treaty with Muscat, that, as the terms of the draft have now been agreed with the Cultan of Muscat, and as the conclusion of a new Treaty is urgently requiredrequired In replacement of the existing Treaty, which is shortly due to expire, we feel that it would be impracticable to suspend the final conclusion of the proposed Treaty pending consultation between the Government© concerned; we should not, of course, wish to suggest that this would preclude such consultation as to the inclusion of provisions of this character in future Commercial Treaties* 6* The provisions of the draft Treaty with Muscat relating to extra-territorial Jurisdiction (i.e* Articles 13, 14 and 15) stand on a somewhat different footing* In the first place, however, it may be pointed out that the provisions of the new Treaty do not Involve any change In this respect, but are designed substantially to maintain existing rights* Moreover, in the case of a small country llfce muscat where the native courts are extremely primitive and the local laws unsuitable in manyto tf' t tw &lt;!*»*+&amp;* ej' Ujt.#£j \X4^&lt;L H^i' to^ sifeiil^r respects ior application to persons of European origin and where there is no institution such as the Mixed Courts in Egypt as an alternative, the right of recourse to a Court maintained by the United Kingdom and the application of it is thought, be considered as Indisputable a benefit, as are any of the other rights proposed to be obtained for British subjects generally under other provisions of the Treaty# 7. [as regards]ihe discussions which took place at the time of the Imperial Conference, 1937, and subsequently, regarding the application of extra-territorial the United Kingdom do not wish to dissent from the view that the exercise of such jurisdiction in respect of British subjects belonging to the Union of South Africa {0 must be regarded as exercised with the rather than local law must C consentas consent of His Majesty's government in the Union; they would he quite willing, if the Union Government should so desire, that the Order in Council which will f v T, eventually require to he passed for the exercise of such jurisdiction should he expressed to he passed at the request and with the consent of the Union Ci-'overament, or, alternatively, if that % course were preferred, that the Union authorities should themselves make the necessary arrangements for passing the Order required in respect of British Z5 We feel that the Union Government may well consider that Muscat, by reason of its special position, can properly t&gt;e treated as standing in a different position from other countries , r where extra-territorial Jurisdiction is or has been until recently enjoyed, such subjects belonging to the Union Caa*. cu* f o cu- 0L,1 °, as China, Egypt and Morocco* From this point of view it may he thought that. though legally the position is not the same, substantially the position is the same as in other territories in the Persian Gull’ (Koweit, Bahrein, etc), in which His Majesty exercises jurisdiction on the advice ol' His Majesty*s Government in bvL4*u a*sr ^ ^ 4o the United Kingdom over [all perwme not |? tAOvrwo &lt;n)'Uo Oar. wO • * being 1 subjects ot the native ruler iS^SA-dU iA-tXb SfC*****- ^k4.cA.

An early expression of the views of the Union Government on the question of the Order in Council for the continued exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction in Muscat would be appreciated, as It is important at a© early a date as possible to oroceed with the drafting of the necessary Order* cux uxxixtxUzjci* 4 71 ^ c^jUjxa^ Turn lu*fT*fl** ft A/ (£*+**** Cgkju+a.

I ought to sey that there are several other Commercial Treaties now in contemplation, the drafts of which include provisions of the kind in question, negotiations for which have already begun, as the Union Government have been informed. I have been asked to say that, while we do not wish to prejudice the general question, we feel that it might be rather embarrassing for us if the suggestion were made that we should suspend action on such treaties, pending consultation with the other Government8. W. hope very much therefore that this point will not be ruleed. In paragraph 5 of the Secretary e.g. with Chllej^i^rssSSentrand Colon Yours sincerely,(2 1 ^ The Committee had before them a memorandum dated 17th September circulated in preparation for the meeting. 2. After the Chairman had explained the object of tho. meeting the Committee proceeded to consider first the Union Government’s observations on the formal articles (Nos. 1, 20 and 21) of the proposed treaty trith 'Muscat. There was general agreement that the reply to the Union Government should be to call attention to the report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1930, which were approved by all the delegations with the exception of the. Irish Free State delegation; that v/e could find nothing in the discussions on nationality or exterritoriality at the Imperial Conference of 1937 which could be regarded as expressly indicating that the Union Government desired the termination of the practice reaffirmed by that report; that if the Union Government now wished to discontinue this practice the other Dominions must be consulted; and that in the meantime it was not possible to make any change in the proposed treaty 'with Muscat, which had been accepted by the Sultan of Muscat. 3. /It should be added, in parenthesis, that the points raised by the. Union Government with regard to Articles 1 and 20 of the treaty with Muscat apply to the corresponding articles in the proposed commercial treaty with Colombia, of which a draft is now on its way to Bogota. Although the negotiations for this treaty are not so far advanced as those for the Muscat treaty, its conclusion cannot be held up pending the result of our discussion with the/1 ^ f ^ the Union Government and of any subsequent consultation with the other Dominions, because the denounced treaty of 1866 with Colombia will expire next March/ 4. The Committee then considered the Union High Commissioner’s letter in relation to the articles in the Muscat treaty (Nos. 13, 14 and 15) dealing with ex-territorial jurisdiction. The sense of the meeting was that paragraphs 6 , 7 and 8 of the memorandum of the 17th September might appropriately form the basis of the answer to the Union Government, to whom it would be pointed out that Muscat was a border-line case inasmuch as Muscat, though formally independent, was in such close relations with the Government of India that its position was in practice analogous in some respects to that of a protected state; the Union Government would be given an opportunity of saying whether (l) they preferred to treat Muscat as a country to which the 1937 discussions on exterritoriality did not apply, (2) of treating Muscat as a country to which they did apply and (a) participating in our Order in Council or (b) making one of their own or (c) asking for the exclusion of Union nationals from the new Order in Council that will have to be substituted for the existing Order—in—Council when the new treaty comes into force. We should not suggest (c) as a course which we thought they could possibly want. j•£ was agreed that the Dominions Office should draft an answer to the Union High Commissioner’s letter, 0 4 the end of the meeting Mr. Stephenson asked what our attitude would be if consultation with the Dominions were/! ^ were to reveal that the majority of them desired the discontinuance by the United Kingdom of the practice of stipulating in treaties for benefits for British subjects belonging to all parts of the Commonwealth. The general feeling was that as the discontinuance of the practice would greatly simplify our task in the negotiation of future treaties, there was now no advantage to be gained on constitutional grounds to justify the United Kingdom Government in pressing for the maintenance of the practice.

A memorandum is circulated herev/ith, offering certain observations on Mr. te water* s letter. Foreign Office, September 17th, 1938.Memorandum 1. a copy of the Union High Commissioner's letter is attached as annex 1, together with (a) the text of Articles 1, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21 of the draft treaty with Muscat (annex 2), and (b) a copy (annex 3) of the report of the Inter Imperial Relations Committee of the 1930 Imperial Conference, to which reference is made in paragraph 3 below c 2. The passages of the memorandum that deal with Articles 1, 20 and 21 of the draft treaty with Muscat apply with equal iorce to the corresponding articles (numbers 1 and 9) of the draft of a commercial treaty with Colombia now being negotiated, though the latter treaty contains no Article corresponding to Article 21 of the treaty with Muscat (the ’’nevertheless' ax-use) 5 because it is proposed to negotiate a separate instrument abort the treatment of British goods in Colombia. 3. Except to the extent to which Union goods are covered by article 21, the treaty will not apply to goods of Union origin unless the Union accede under the accession clause. It is not correct to say that the accession clause is rare in bilateral treaties (unless the reference is to bilateral treaties concluded by foreign countries); the clause has been included in almost every commercial, extradition and civil procedure convention, concluded by the United Kingdom since the war, as well as in certain other treaties. frequent use has been made of it by Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia .. *(6) / V 1 2 0 • Australia and New Zealand, particularly for accession to extradition and civil procedure conventions. Articles 1, 20, and 21 referred to in Mr. te Water's letter, are, indeed, in the ’ standard form approved (the Irish Free State alone dissenting) in the Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1930, (Annex 3). (4) In the second paragraph of his letter, Mr. te Water is presumably referring to the report on nationality drawn up at the Imperial Conference of 1937 (page 23 et seg. of Cmd. 5482) and to the discussions at the time of that Conference with regard to the exercise of exterritorial jurisdiction. There appears to he nothing in those discussions which can he regaidsd as expressly indicating that the Union Government desired the termination of the practice approved in 1930 with regard to the conclusion of treaties stipulating benefits for British subjects etc. belonging to all parts of the Coimaonwealth. (5) The discussions with regard to exterritorial jurisdiction brought out the points that (a) the maintenance of a court maintained by the United Kingdom in a country where His Majesty exercises jurisdiction inter alia over British subjects who are nationals of the Dominions must be deemed in modern conditions to be with the consent and wish of the Governments of the Dominions, and (b) that if they wished their nationals to be excluded from the jurisdiction of the court, this could be done. Further, in the case of the Union, a new Order in Council providing for such jurisdiction over all British subjects would contain a recital that the Union Government had assented to, and requested, the making of the Order; alternatively the'Union Government might make an Order in Council themselves.(6) In Articles 13 to 15 of the draft Treaty with Muscat His Majesty, in a treaty to he signed on behalf of United Kingdom and India, obtains a grant of exterritorial jurisdiction in respect of all British subjects, including therefore Union nationals. In the case of backward country like Muscat, where the native courts are extremely primitive and the local laws unsuitable in many respects for application to white people, and where there is no institution such as the Mixed Courts of Egypt as an alternative, the right of recourse to a court maintained by the United Kingdom and the application of British law must surely be as indisputably a benefit as are any of the other rights obtained for British subjects under the other provisions of the treaty. (7) It is clear that nothing of what was agreed as regards treaties and the exercise of jurisdiction in a country like China applies to a British protected State, such as Zanzibar, the Malay States or the British protected States on the Persian Gulf (Koweit, Bahrain, etc,) These States are States under the control of the United Kingdom, and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have obtained, and will be obtaining in the future, agreements with the rulers, under which jurisdictional powers within the States are divided on the footing that, while the native ruler exercises jurisdiction over his own nationals and •&gt; etfctr perhaps certain types of foreigners, these persons, including, as well as British subjects and British protected persons of all kinds, the nationals of all or some other foreign countries, come under British jurisdiction. In these cases we could not possibly admit that we are under any obligation to consult with any Dominion as to the terms of the agreements made with the rulers nor as to the provisions of the Orders in Council made to exercise the jurisdiction so obtained. (8) /4* (8) It is true that Muscat is not technically on the same footing, since the grant of jurisdiction here is in respect of British subjects only, and Muscat is not technically a British protected State. On the other hand, it is a small primitive native State, the ruler of which receives a British subsidy, and which is so strongly under the influence of the United Kingdom that in fact, though not legally, it is in much the same position as a British protected State. It would therefore be justifiable and expedient that the Union Government, who have no practical interest in the question, should decide to classify this treaty as if it were in the category of treaties concluded with British protected States, in which case neither the rules applicable to other treaties nor the 1957 discussions with regard to the making of Orders in Council with regard to jurisdiction apply. (9) On grounds of principle, it would of course be impossible to meet the request of the Union Government for the abandonment of the practice adopted at the 1950 conference for stipulating for benefits for all British subjects etc. without prior consultation with the other Dominions. As this could hardly be completed before February 1959, when the Muscat Treaty must be brought into force, it would seem impracticable to make any change at this stage in Articles 1, 20 or 21 of the draft treaty with Muscat. As the negotiation of a new treaty with Colombia is also a matter of urgency, it seems necessary to leave the corresponding Articles (1 and 9) of that treaty in their present form in the draft which is shortly to be sent to Bogotd. Other commercial agreements (e.g. with Switzerland and Egypt) are also in draft, and it would follow that the terms of the corresponding articles in these should also not be changed pending the result of the present correspond ence with the Union Government. Foreign Office, 17th September, 1958.)PY ANNEX I LETTER FROM THE UNION HIGH COMISSIONER TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS. 109/21. 16th August, 1938. My dear Secretary of State, acting on the instructions of my Government, I have the honour to invite your attention to Mr. MacDonald’s despatch E. No. 10 of the 5th May, 1938, and to offer the following observa tions with regard to the subject matter thereof. 2. His Majesty’s Government in the Union of South Africa have perused the draft Treaty between the United Kingdom and Muscat and wish to draw attention to several articles thereof, viz. Articles 1, 13-15, 20 and 21, which, according to their view, constitute a departure from the understanding arrived at, in 1937, regarding the respective spheres of action of the several Govern ments of His Majesty in respect of nationals and the interests of nationals of each Member of the Commonwealth. It will be remem bered that it was common cause then that the mere fact of a person being a British subject does not entitle any Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations to treat him as its national and exercise in regard to him the jurisdiction and functions which any Govern ment ordinarily exercises in respect of persons who are its nationals. 3. His Majesty’s Government in the Union being responsible for regulating the treaty relations which they wish to exist 'between the Union and any other country, and for stipulating benefits for such of His Majesty's subjects as are nationals of the Union, feel that in the draft Treaty in question this aspect of . • j Risht Honourable , U CXX J v J- Dominions Office, S. W. 1.of the case did not receive due attention, in so far as the articles referred to above purport to affect also His Majesty's subjects who are nationals of the Union, ships and aircraft registered in the Union and goods of Union origin imported into Muscat, and, further, contains an accession clause (Article 20) which, although usual in multilateral treaties intended to be of general application, is very rare in bilateral agreements, and, within the British Umpire, came into use at a time the United Kingdom was seized of the power and the responsibility, to regu late, at least formally, the relations between its colonies and foreign countries. 4. If, with respect to the accession clause, other Members of the Commonwealth would like the old practice to continue, the Union Government would not raise any further objection than the above to its maintenance in the Treaty, but, in regard to the other articles, they feel that something should be done in order to obviate what they feel would be an encroachment, on the part of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, upon a field of action legitimately falling within the scope of the authority of His Majesty's Government in the Union. 5. As the draft submitted now stands, the Treaty is one ex clusively between the United Kingdom and Muscat. Article 19 shows that it is not intended to apply even to the colonies and dependencies of the United Kingdom, unless rendered applicable to such territories by further special action. This being the case, all encroachment could, it is submitted, be avoided by confining the Treaty to British subjects, who are nationals of the United Kingdom, or are connected with territories subject to the juris diction of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and to ships and aircraft registered in the United Kingdom or m territories subject to the jurisdiction of His Majesty's Government ..Government in the United Kingdom. Provision could then he made in the accession clause for the application of the clauses of the treaty to such of His Majesty’s subjects as are under the jurisdiction, and such ships and aircraft as are registered in the territory, of the Member of the Commonwealth who accedes to the Treaty. Any Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations who wishes to enjoy the benefits of the Treaty could then accede thereto, so that the necessity for making provisions such as those contained in Article 21 would fall away. 6 . It would be much appreciated by my Government if the Government of the United Kingdom could see their way clear to reconsider the terms of the draft Treaty in the light of the above observations, with a view to relieving them of the embarrassing position in which they have been placed by the provisions now appearing therein. 7. The difficulties arising from the use of too wide terms necessitating restrictive provisos, as well as the continuance of a practice which has become obsolete, would bhus be duly provided against. Believe me, (Signed) Yours sincerely, C. T.

November 11th, 1930« The Commibtee recommend that the following statement be placed on record for the guidance of any Government which may in future be negotiating a commercial treaty:- (a) When His Majesty in negotiating a treaty or other international agreement acts in respect of one of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations only, he cannot and will not purport to bind, or to affect detrimentally the rights of his subjects belonging to another part of the Commonwealth; unless the Government of such part have expressly consented thereto by the issue of full powers to that effect on their behalf either to the Plenipotentiary of the negotiating Government or to a separate plenipotentiary of their own.(' ) P laG ‘ti ce of stipulating for benefits (i) for all His Lajesty s subjects ? (ii) for all Commonwealth ships, (iii) for goods imported from whatever part of the British Empire, and (iv) for an accession clause in treaties or other agreements with foreign Powers when His Majesty acts on behalf of one of the Members of the British Commonwealth only should be continued as far as possible inasmuch as it is felt by all that it would be in the interests of each Member of the British Commonwealth to be placed in such a position as to be able to avail itself of these advantages whenever it so desires. (c) As regards (i) and (ii), it should be made clear that advantages for sub jects and ships accrue to all His Majesty’s subjects and to all ships belonging to subjects of His Majesty by means of an interpretation clause to the following effect to be inserted in each treaty:- 'Unless expressly restricted to any particular territory in the provisions of this treaty the term 'subjects of either of the High Contracting parties' shall, in relation to His Majesty the King (if need be full title), mean all the subjects of His Majesty wherever domiciled and the term ’ships of either of the High Contracting parties’ shall, as far as His Majesty is concerned, include ships owned by these subjects wherever these ships may be registered, provided that they are registered under the law of some part of the Commonwealth. ** (d)(f) That the following should be tne coton form for the second paragraph of the preamble of commercial treaties:- Desiring to facilitate and extend still further their mutual relations of trade and commerce. •' NOTE. - It is proposed that the Report of the Conference should not contain any reference to the question of the Form of Commercial Treaties, but that the above statement if approved, be placed on record by being attached as an appendix to the Minutes of the next meeting of the Prime Ministers and Heads of Delegations* The Delegation of the Irish Free state dissent from this Reportc oigned on behalf of tne Committee: R?

Judicial Committee Privy Council Mr, Colin Smith(K 5143/305/91) Subject to anything the have to add, I think we should write to the Dominions Office about this letter from the South African High Commissioner, copy India Office, on the following lines. The Union High Commissioner in his letter of the 16th August refers to certain articles in the draft treaty with Muscat and says that n His Majesty’s Government in the Union being responsible for regulating the treaty relations which they wish to exist between the Union end any other country for stipulating benefits for such of His la jesty* s subjects as ere nationals of the Union, feel that in the draft treaty in question this aspect of the case did not receive due attention in so far as the articles referred to above purport to affect also ills Majesty’s subjects who were nationals of the Union, ships and aircraft registered in the Union end goods of Union origin imported into Muscat; and further (sic) contains an accession clause which is very rare in bilateral agreements, and within the British Empire, came into use when the United Kingdom was seized of the power and the responsibility, to regulate, at least formally, the relations between its colonies ana foreign countries.'* The High Commissioner's letter then goes on to say that while the Union Government would not object to trie accession clause if the other members of the Commonwealth want it, ^hcy feel something ought to be done in order to obviate what they woulu feel to be 'an encroachment on the part of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom upon a field of action legitimately felling within the scope of the authority of the Union', tmd suggest that in order to avoid this enoroachaent the treaty should he confined to British subjects who are nationals of the United Kingdoa etc. to ships ana aircraft/aircraft registered in the United Kingdom etc. end perhaps also to the nationals, ships and aircraft of other members of the Commonwealth who accede under the accession clause and aslt that the provisions of the treaty should be reconsidered accordingly. In fact however the draft treaty will not apply to goods of Union origin unless the Union accede under the accession clause. All the articles relating to goods (vide, X*or example Article 5) refer to goods produced or manufactured in the territories of His laiesty and by virtue of the definition of the expression * territories of His Majesty* in Article l(1) this would not cover the Union unless the Union acceded. Further it is not true to say that the accession clause is rare in bilateral treaties unless the reference is to bilateral treaties concluded by foreign countries. This accession clause has been included in almost every commercial, extradition, civil procedure convention concluded recently by this country which must amount in all to some hundred treaties as well as certain other treaties concluded by the United Kingdom* amongst the articles referred to by the Union Government in the Muscat Treaty are Articles 1, 20 and 21. These articles are in the standard form approved by the Imperial Conference in which the Union of South Africa participated and in which the Imperial Conference, including the Union of South Africa, specifically wished and desired the Government of the United Kingdom to insert such clause© and to stipulate for benefits for ©11 British subjects end all British ships in treaties concluded by the United Kingdom. Consequently the United Kingdom has since consistently done so end there has been no indication up till this moment of any disagreement by the Union Government with this policy and we i eel that the Union Government cannot now expect us to change the terms of a/a treaty whieh has now been settled with the foreign party vrtien we had had no previous notice that they wished the practice to be discontinued. The Dominions Office in Mr. dhannan* s letter to Mr. Gibson, Inaia Office, (paragraph 3) in E 1520 stated that these clauses should be included in this treaty. In the second paragraph of his letter, Mr. te Water refers to the understanding arrived at in 1937 regarding the respective spheres of action of the several Governments of His Majesty in respect of nationals and the interests of nationals of each member of the Commonwealth. It is presumed that this is a reference to the report on nationality drawn up at the Imperial Conference of 1937 ana the discussion at that conference with regard to the A exercise of exterritorial jurisdiction. There is nothing (so far as I am aware) in any of these discussions to indicate that the Union w vemment desired the termination of the practice approved in 1930 with regard to the conclusion of tx^eaties Swlgu.lt ting benefits for British subjects etc. belonging to all parts of the Commonwealth. The discussions with regard to exterritorial jurisdiction brought out the points that where a court maintained by the United Kingdom in a country where His la jesty exercises jurisdiction inter alia over British subjects who are nationals of the Dominions this must be deemed in modern conditions to be with the consent and wish of the Governments of the Dominions; that if they wished their nationals to be P excluded from the jurisdiction of the court this could be done: and further in the case of the Union a new Order In Council providing for such jurisdiction over all British subjects would either contain a recital that the Union Government had assented and requested the making of the Order; (a draft recital on this basis was actually drawn up for use in Egypt in the following terms:/ x The papers with*rTgar&lt;Tto extraterritorial jurisdiction are T 9370, 10575, 11472 of 1937 and 235, 1563 of 1936. / see the end of paragraph 3 of the memorandum in I 105^5.terras: x Vjid whereas in accordance with Section 7 of the Act of Parliament of the Union of South Africa No. 70 of 1934 His Majesty’s Government in the Union of South Africa have requested and consented to the making of this Order”}; or the In Articles 13 to 15 of the draft Treaty with Muscat His Majesty in a treaty to he signed on benalf of United Kingdom and India obtains e grant of exterritorial jurisdiction in respect of all British subjects including therefore Union nationals. In the case of a backward country like Muscat where the native courts ax^e extremely primitive and the local laws unsuitable in many respects for application to white people and there is no institution such as the Mixed Courts of Egypt as an alternative, the right of recourse to a court maintained by the United Kingdom and the application of British law must surely be us indisputably a benefit as are any of the other rights obtained for British subjects under the other provisions of the treaty. The ref oi'© it might be contended that, in including these provisions applicable to all British subjects, we were nex*ely following the policy agreed ana aesired by the Union in 1930 end that nothing which was said in 1937 affected this, since the discussion related almost entirely to the question of the Orders in Council which should be passed for the exercise oi the jurisdiction once obtained. But this, however, is perhaps not altogether convincing and it might perhaps he admitted in general that the 1937 diaoussione showed that, even if the 1930 policy was left in force as regards obtaining the ordinary benefits obtained by treaty, there should have been special consultation as regards treaty provisions obtaining exterritorial rights. I Union of south Africa might make an Order in Council themselves. But, a Omitting that this would be so in the case of a country ^ see paregrap T 10575 ana/ „ { like China, there is still the question as to whether it applies in the case of Muscat. In this connexion we should refer to page 3 of Sir H. Batterbee’ s letter to Sir William Claiht of the x S9th July (C 60/4} and to paragraph 10 of Mr. Bowker's letter of the &amp;2nd March to Mr. Shannon E 7302. It would be possible and perhaps advisable to take the following line in this case. It is clear that nothing of what wee agreed as regards treaties and the exercise of jurisdiction in a country like Chine applies to a British protected State, such as Zanzibar, the Malay States or the British protected States on the Persian Gulf (Koweit Bahrein etc*) These States are States under the control of the United Kingdom and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have obtained and will be obtaining in the future, agreements with the rulers, under which jurisdictional powers within the States are divided on the footing that, while the native ruler exercises jurisdiction over his own nationals and perhaps certain types of foreigners, including otir r persons, as well as British subjects and British protected persons of all kinds,/the nationals of other foreign countries, come under British jurisdiction. In these cases we could not possibly f admit that we are under any obligation to consult with any Dominion as to the terms of the agreements made with the rulers 1 nor as to the provisions of the Orders in Council made to ; exercise the jurisdiction so obtained. We could then go on to say, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of tr. Bowker’s letter, that Muscat is not technically on the same footing. The grant of jurisdiction here is in respect of British subjects only and Muscat is not technically © British protected State. On the other / x in T 11472other hand, it is a small primitive native State, the ruler of ds* dudj-*, dL&amp;Zt* u* fi. which receives a British subsidy and which is so strongly under the influence of the United Kingdom that in fact, though not legally, it is in much the same position as a British protected btate anu that on these grounds we think that it would be justifiable ana expedient that the Union Government, who have no practical interest in the question seeing that the presence in iuscat of a British subject who may be a Union national must be the rarest possible occurrence, should decide to classify this treaty as if* it were in the category of treaties concluded m*ith British protected States, in which case the rules applicable to other treaties do not apply nor do the 1937 discussions with regard to the making of Orders in Council with regard to jurisdiction. «e might conclude by saying that the Foreign Office feel it would be impossible to meet the request of the Union Government X*or the abandonment of the practice adopted at the 1930 conference for stipulating for benefits for all British subjects etc. without prior consultation with the other Lominions and therefore impracticable to make any change in Articles 1, 20 or 21 of the draft treaty with Muscat; that while we could technically exclude British subjects most closely connected with the Union of South Africa from the provisions of Articles 13 to 15, the matter would be extremely difficult to explain to the Sultan and it seems doubtful whether the inion Government can really desire it. In fact in the case of Muscat we should not have any great objection to inserting into the Preamble of the new draft Muscat Order a clause such as was once drafted for use in the case of Egypt# although we should be unwilling to ta&amp;e such action in the case of Orders in Gouncil made in respect of the other Persian Gulf States anu that we would in fact much rather this was not done in the case of .luscet, tutfHe matter was settled with the Onion on the lines A indicated in the previous paragraph.

My clear Secretary of state. Acting on the instructions of my Government, I have the honour to invite your attention to Mr. MacDonald's despatch D No.10 of the 5th May, 1938, and to offer the following observations with regard to the subject matter thereof. His Majesty's Government in the Union of South Africa have perused the draft Treaty between the United Kingdom and Muscat and ?/ish to draw attention to several articles thereof, viz. Articles 1, 13-15, 20 and 21, which, according to their view, constitute a departure from the understanding arrived at, in 1937, regarding the respective spheres of action of the several Governments of His Majesty in respect of nationals and the interests of nationals of each Member of the Commonwealth. It will be remembered that it was common cause then that the mere fact of a person being a British subject does not entitle any Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations to treat him as its national and exercise in regard to him the jurisdiction and functions which any Government ordinarily exercises in respect of persons who are its nationals. His Majesty's Government in the Union being responsible for regulating the treaty relations which they wish to exist between the Union and any other country, and for Right Honourable Lord Stanley, P.C., M.P., Secretary of State for Dominion -affairs. Dominions Office, S. W. !•/ 1 . i oi stipulating oeneiits on such of His Majesty's subjects Treaty in question this aspect of the case did not receive due attentionj in so lar as the articles referred to above purport to affect also His Majesty*s subjects who are nationals of the Union, ships and aircraft registered in the Union and goods of Union origin imported into Muscat, and, further, contains an accession clause (Article 20) which, although usual in multilateral treaties intended to be of general application, is very rare in bilateral agree ments, and, within the British Empire, came into use at a time the United Kingdom was seized of the power and the responsibility, to regulate, at least formally, the relations between its colonies and foreign c ountries. Members of the Commonwealth would like the old practice to continue, the Union Government would not raise any further objection than the above to its maintenance in the Treaty, but, in regard to the other articles, they feel that some thing should be done in order to obviate what they feel would be an encroachment, on the part of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, upon a field of action legitimately falling within the scope of the authority of His Majesty’s Government in the Union, As the draft submitted now stands, the Treaty is one excl usively between the United Kingdom and Muscat, Article 19 shows that it is not intended to apply even to the colonies and dependencies of the United Kingdom, unless rendered applicable to such territories by further special action. This being the case, all encroachment could, it is submitted, be avoided by confining the Treaty to British subjects, who are nationals of the United Kingdom, wi q.iq connected with territories subject to the jurisdiction of as ar4nationals of the Union, feel that in the draft If, with respect to the accession clause, other HisKis Majesty* s Government in the United Kingdom, ships and aircraft registered in the United Kingdom'or in territories subject to the jurisdiction of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Provision could then be made in the accession clause for the application of the clauses of the treaty to such of His Majesty’s subjects as are under the jurisdiction, and such ships and aircraft as are registered in the territory, of the Member of the Commonwealth who accedes to the Treaty. Any Member of the British commonwealth of Nations who wishes to enjoy the oenefits oi the Treaty could then accede thereto, so that the necessity for making provisions such as those contained in Article 21 would fall away. It would be much appreciated by my Government if the Government oi the United Kingdom could see their way clear to reconsider the terms of the draft Treaty in the light of the above observations, with a view to relieving them of the embarrassing position in which they have been placed by the provisions now appearing therein. The difficulties arising from the use of too wide terms necessitating restrictive provisos, as well as the continuance of a practice which has become obsolete, would thus be duly provided against. Believe me. Yours sincerely, (ogd.) C. T. te Water.Confidential uJUa1W2J l Office of the Political Resident i 1 w ' &gt; in the Pers ian Grulf, Gamp, Karachi. D.O.WQ.C/612 Dated the 5th September, 1938 The India Office have sent me a copy of Peel’s demi official letter No. P.Z.6004/38, dated the 27th August 1938, to you, regarding the Muscat Treaty. Will you please let me know if you want me to take any action here before your return ? I see that you had an idea of signing the Treaty with the Sultan in Muscat in October, and if this is to be possible, these outstanding points must necessarily be settled before your return. As the Sultan has a copy of the draft Treaty in Arabic I do not see how amendments are to be inserted in the signature copies without a prior refer ence to him; this is particularly the case in regard to Article 12 (2) where a substantial amendment is proposed. 2 . I might point out also that the marginal addendum to Article 1 (iv) should be similar to that to Articles 1 (iii) and 19 (i),i.e. 'except Kuwait and Kalba' and not 'except Kuwait and Zanzibar'. 3. I am returning to Bahrain next Monday, so perhaps you will reply to me there. I hope you are enjoying your leave. Yours sincerely, The Hon’ble Sir Trenchard Bowie, ECIE.,CBE., c/o Messrs.Lloyds Bank Ltd., 6 Pall Mall, LOMDON.Dear Symon, I attach a list of the passages where substantial discrepancies occuijas between the English original of the treaty and the draft Arabic translation. As I said in our conversation this morning, this list does not include a rather large number of passages where it would be desirable, either on grammatical grounds or in the interests of exact clarity, to make minor emendations in the Arabic. I hope that this list will suffice for your present purposes. Yours sincerely, U L ‘ 35 August 19381 - Article 1 .

This omission may be supplied as follows, provisionally:- ! 'll Article 4. The opening phrase reads literally, in the Arapic, 'It shall be permitted to nationals of His Majesty reside_nt in the territories of the Sultan... ' The discrepancy can be remedied by omitting the word ^ a l l (v/hich should incidentally have been ). In rendering the phrase 'any other legal manner', the adjective has been used, which suggests reference to the Sharia law. To avoid this restrictive implication, the word can be used. The phrase 'to possess^ the same' has been omitted. This may be supplied thus: Article 5 (4)(a_l The ohrase 'the foreign place of destination' has been rendered' 'the place'. The following would be an exact translation: i / Article 6 (2)/ IJArticle 6 (2) The following is the literal version of the Arabic: All the goods on which duty is to he levied shall he fixed according to the price of their market....

Article 19 (1) The marginal addendum ’’except Kov/eit. ... and Kalha” is omitted. This omission may be supplied as follows, provisionally:~ Article 20 (l) The phrase ’’any Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations” has been rendered ’’any of the English Dominions”. To bring this phrase into line with the satisfactory rendering of ’’British Commonwealth of Nations” in Article 1 (iii), the following translation would be more suitable: Article 21 (l)/I'tm o 3. Article 21 (l) The Arabic rendering of this section reads, literally: 'So long as the provisions of the present Treaty are not applicable in any territory referred to in Articles 19 and 20, by virtue of accession under Article 20 or by notice of extension under Article 19, goods produced or manufactured in the territories of the Sultan will be accorded treatment as favourable as that accorded to goods produced or manufactured in any other foreign country'. /The rest of the section has been omitted in the Arabic draftTy 7 A full translation of the section would be:- p ^ V r &gt; H J aJI j Jj U 0 )L\ aUI-h T* 1:1 ^ui &lt;Sue ^LkJU -jyAl ^ j jl L * J i&gt;V. y-UJI j J ^&gt;1 ^&gt;1 AiL Aj j ,1 Article 22 (1) The phrase 'the proper interpretation of the English or Arabic text of one or other of the Treaty stipulations' has been rendered by 'the translation of the text of the English or the Arabic or the one or the other'.

In order to get round the difficulty of the interpretation of the word w owner w in the sixteenth line of Article 12(2) - i.e. whether owner of the cargo or owner of the ship is meant - and also the difficulty of what is meant by the word 'goods* in the thirteenth line of Article 12(2) - i.e. whether this includes 'parts of a ship' we would like to introduce a fairly substantial amendment into the Article. After the words 'they shall further take every possible care that* in Article 12(2) we should like the sentence to continue 'such vessel and all parts thereof and all furniture and appurtenances belonging thereto, and all goods and merchandise saved therefrom, including any which may have been cast into the sea, or the proceeds thereof, if sold, as well as all papers found on board such stranded .B.

I do not think we have any further observations to offer on these negotiations or on the final amendments in the drat;t text of the Treaty. But as Beckett, who has been so closely concerned with the drafting of this treaty is away, I should be grateful, if the delay is not important, if final approval of the text could be deferred till his return early in September.

No doubt he is well awareof this already, hut the Sultan may have different ideas on the subject. Yours sincerely, m15th August, 1938. Dear Peel, Thank you for your letter of the 8th August (P.Z. 5363/38) in regard to the revision of the Muscat Treaty. I think that the only point in it which calls for any remark on our part is that mentioned in Sir T* Fowle f s Express Letter relating to Article 7 of the draft Treaty and the draft letters regarding that Article to he exchanged between the Political Resident and the Sultan, as to shipping dues and the Sultan’s desire for an assurance that the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee will reduce their total dues in proportion to the reduction in their present expenses brought about by the arrangement now contemplated. On this I have consulted our Mercantile Maine Department who say that they see no objection to the Sultan’s suggestion, while pointing out that the Government ol India are ohe authority / to reduce the dues^acting on the advice of the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee.

In his reply (B) His Highness accepted the whole of my letter# 5 # i$y note forming the enclosure to A gives ^he changes agreed on in Karachi between His Highness and myself, after reference to His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of India. 6 ./k&amp; I have the following further coimnents to offer. Articl e 1 (ii), (iii) &gt; (iv) . The juridical and commercial status of nationals of the States of the Aden protectorate and Zanzibar was the most important point I had to discuss with His Highness, and one to which he attached considerable weight. The reasons for the Sultans attitude were given in paragraphs 3 and 4 of my telegram Ho.T/158, dated 30th June 1938, and seemed to me to deserve consideration. The compromise finally come to, vide paragraph 2 of India Office telegram Ho. 1232, dated 6th July 1938, appears to me a reasonable one. \s P-1 39^ Article 1 (v) » Drafting amendment. Ho comments* Article 2 (l) * The question of the participation of British and Indian vessels in the Muscat coasting trade raised in Government of India Ejcpress letter Ho.F.63-H/38, dated 8th June 1938, was disposed of in paragraph 5 of India Office telegram Ho. 1148, dated 22nd June 1938, and was PZuzbo therefore not raised with the Sultan. „ The amendment suggested by His Highness regard- ^ ing the entry of nationals of His Majesty into Muscat p' ] ^rritory was accepted by His Majesty’s Government in (Vo T / ^ 1 paragraph 3 of India Office telegram Ho. 1219, dated 5th July 1938* Article 5 (3). See paragraph 5 of India Office pi. telegram Ho. 1219, dated 5th July 1938, and Government of India telegram Ho.1091, dated 6th July 1938. The position is as explained in paragraph 1 of my telegram Ho.T/l61, dated 2nd July 1938, and does not differ, I imagine, from that in other countries. If a subordinate Customs offic&amp;ftl makes a wrong assessment I presume that the universal practice/-5- ,,4 1 7 goods before the period of four months allowed under Article 5 { 6)5 the latter V7ill desire to collect their customs duties as soon as possible. His Majesty’s Government finally agreed to there being no change, vide paragraph 5 of India Office telegram Ho. 1219, dated 5th July 1938, as did the Government of India, vide their telegram HO.1091, dated 6 th July 1938. Article 7. See letters C and D. (vide paragraph 3(b) of India Office telegram No. 1076, dated 8 th June 1938. A'' . , Wi hifi$ If Re the assurance asked for by Sultan, His Highness’s point of view is apparently that unless the Persian Gulf dues are reduced shipping will not be willing to pay the dues levied by his Government. Article 11. In paragraph 1(3) of Government of India Express Letter No.E.63-N/38, dated 8 th June 1938, it was suggested that the words w at seaport towns” should be inserted after the word 'reside” in the third line of this Article in order to prevent a demand by the Sultan for the appointment of his Consul at the headquarters of the Government of India. I suggested, vide my telegram No. T/l46, dated 24th June 1938, to the Government of India, that the words M and the places at which they reside” should also be deleted, in order to deprive the Sultan of the right to insist at any time in the future that our Consul should reside at any seaport town other than Muscat. To this the Government of India agreed in paragraph 4 of their 1 : ■ 2 telegram No. 1056, dated 29th June 1938. On the changes being suggested to the sultan he stated (vide my telegram No.t/ 163, dated 2nd July 1938, to the Government of India) that he wished to retain the present wording of the Article, quite/jk r - 6 - ' realising that the retention of the words tt and the places at which they reside * 1 would give the G-overnment of India the right to refuse residence of his Consuls at any particular place. He has written letter (s) giving His Majesty’s Consul the right to reside at Muscat. Article 15 ( 1 ). Amendment suggested in para graph 2(c) of India Office telegram Ho.1076, dated 8 th f &gt; ^ ‘ June 1938, accepted by Sultan. Article 15 (l) (iv). See correspondence end ing with paragraph 2 of India Office telegram Ho. 1219, dated 5th July 1938. Our amendment accepted by His Highne s s. Article 16. This is not an Article which is important from our point of view, and if the Sultan had raised strong objections to it in London we were prepared f ly. to omit it. The suggestion made in paragraph 5 of India f&gt; ip s' Office telegram Ho.1148, dated 22nd June 1938, was made i to the Sultan but was not agreeable to him. The final result was the omission of the words ^ora serious offence**, vide paragraph 4 of India Office telegram Ho. 1219, dated f 1 u ^ ^ V- 5th July 1938. Article 19 (1). Sultan accepted the drafting — s amendment suggested in India Office letter Ho.F.Z.4044/38, dated 14th June 1938.

Insertion referred to in fz paragraph 3(d) of India Office telegram Ho. 1076, dated 8 th June 1938, made. 7. Re the translation (F). As you are aware, vide paragraph 4 of my letter Ho.245-S of 14th May 1938, the/, mm - 7 - u ^ t h4'' ^ the translation of the treaty of 1891 caused a good deal of trouble and delay, and on this occasion also was not devoid of difficulty, vide correspondence ending with my telegram Fo.T/l31 of 16th June 1938 # The translation of nay Interpreter, Khan Sahib Mirza Ali, was shown to the Sultan, who had some alterations to suggest* Fortunately His Highness’s own Secretary, Khan Bahadur Ahmad bin Muhammad shubaili, was with him at Karachi and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Siddiq Hasan also came to Karachi on ten days* leave, and was good enough together with Khan Bahadur Ahmad bin Muhammad Shubaili and Khan Sahib Mirza Ali t o f orm a translating Committee of three. Their results were daily submitted to the Sultan, who took considerable trouble in satisfying himself of the correctness of the translation. The result has been that the translation has been done quickly, correctly and economically, and unless there are any serious errors I trust that it will be accepted by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in its present form (see paragraph 8(b) below). 8. What now remains to be done appears to be as follows. (a) for His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to approve finally of the text of the present draft, (b) for arrangements to be made - I suggest in London- for the Arabic text to be checked, (c) for the English and Arabic texts to be prepared for signature^ (d) for the treaty to be signed. I suggest that this could/ for_ if^ 0 l &gt;2 ^ / - ■ .J f ■ -8- 1 could be done by my visiting Muscat in October when I return from leave. As far as the Sultan is concerned he is quite agreeable to this. 9. Reference letter G. This letter is not strictly bound up with the treaty and there is no refer ence in it to the treaty. In view however of the fact that the question arose in correspondence connected with the treaty it may be convenient to deal with it here. The Foreign Office gave their views, vide India Office telegram No. 1126 of 17th June 1938, a.nd the Government of India theirs in their telegram No. 1060 of 29th June 1938. In further correspondence with the Government of India, the latter stated that they were prepared to give certain reciprocal privileges which are set forth in letter G. The net result is we have secured privileges for our pared, if necessary, to give to a Muscati Consul in India, though at this stage the Sultan gave no indication that he would ash for such privileges. Incidentally there was no question of persuading the Sultsh against his will to accord these privileges? he accorded them readily. 3d. T.C. FO-TLE political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

This is reasonable in itself, and our merchants have right of reference to arbitration under Article 6(4), This, as well as the composition of the tariff Board, (Article 6(3)), gives our merchants strong safeguards and, if I press the Sultan further on customs procedure, 1 am afraid he may perhape change his mind on these two important points. I do not therefore propose to suggest any amendment to the clause in question. I trust that His Majesty's Government and Government of India will agree? 3. Article 5(4)(b) and 5(6).

(b) After a good deal of discussion he ig prepared to limit his jurisdiction to 'nationals of Zanzibar of Omani origin who own property in Oman', but he is prepared to accord them the trade privileges under the^rsaty.

In regard to the amendments set out in India Office telegram No. 1076 of 8 th June to the Government of India (India Office letter p.Z.3994/38 of 11th June) and in peel’s letter P.Z.4044/38 of 14th June to Fowle, we have no comments. With reference to Watts’ comments set out in India Office telegram No. 1100 of 14th June to the Government of India (India Office letter P.Z.4135/38 of 15th June) I send you herewith a minute by Beckett which reijresents our views. As regards the comments set out in Government of India Express letter P.63-N/38 of 8 th June (India Office letter P. Gibson, Esq. '°- ^ -S'c (Y, POLITIC &gt;L AND T. INDIA OFFICE ! ' U .

Article 2(1) has nothing to do with the coasting trade, hut the relevant article is Article 3(3) which provides that in all that relates to navigation and the treatment of shipping, the Sultan undertakes to treat British vessels not less favourably in any respect than Omani vessels and the vessels of any foreign country and therefore covers the costing trade.//1 think the suggestion in Article 11 is quite unnecessary* As regards Article 16, I do not really tnink any amendment of the provision is required, hut if any amendment is made it should he to insert the words 'punishable under the law applied by the consular authorities of His Majesty with penalties not exceeding (Sgd.)

C&gt; As regards /Articles 1 and 19, I agree with Major Watt’s suggestions, hut would point out that the case for striking out Zanzibar from the exceptions is stronger than that for striking out the Aden protectors te* As regards Article 5 (o) I have nothing to say except that the words 'Sultan’s territories' should he substituted for 'Sultanate' As regards Articles 5 } (4) (h) and 61 have no observations* As regards Article 6(2) I am not sure that Major Watts is right, but the point is primarily for the Board of Trade* It seems to me, however, that Article 6(3) provides that the Tariff Board fixes the actual valuations and all that Article 6 ( 2 ) does is to give some indication as to the principle the Tariff Board should * follow in doing this* As regards Article 6 ( 4 ), what Major Watts actually proposes is that a sentence should be added that if the experts were unable to agree as to the choice of an umpire the decision of the customs house authorities snail be final* I do not think this will do because this will make it certain that there never will be any agreement as to the choice of an umpire* I would suggest saying In the event of their being unable to agree on the choice of an umpire, the umpire shall be chosen by the consular authorities of His Majesty and the Sultan* As regards Article 13(l)(iv) I think Major Watts is wrong here because he thinks that tne section requires the/0 the ease to be referred to the Moslem religious court apparently without option should any other party to the proceedings he a national of the Sultan, But that is not whst the section says. It says ^when the person whose status is in question is a Moslem”, and that is quite a different thing from saying any other party to the proceedings* I do not think any amendment is required.

Following on our telephone conversation, we have considered K -v ’ 4 .' i •* a ... £* m . . i the points raised by Watts in his letter to Gibson of llth June. We have only the following observations to make (and even as regards most of these points I think that you are more concerned than we are):- Article 5(5)« Would not the intention be more clearly brought out if Watts* clause (which I gather would be an addition at the end of the present paragraph) were amended to read: 'There shall be no variation of the Customs duties as between Sv/l G&amp;W * fer/ different ports of the Sultanate, and when goods have once been landed at any such port and the duty thereon has been paid, the goods shall not be liable to re—assessment of duty at the same or any other port 11 . Article 6(2). Our interest is of course slight compared with India* s, but we are disposed to feel, as regards Watts proposal, that it is desirable to fix a uniform basis of valuation, whether there is a Tariff Board or not* Otherwise what is there to prevent the ^Tariff Board from valuing different -4? oU + non, Esq ? /articles . Cry--! ^ POLITICAL AND U r3(TAJ?7 70 Gtff'GZ mart ,tc articles on different tases? Moreover, a valuation list which covered everything would he impossibly long. Surely some principle will need to be laid down to enable Customs, officers to decide on the valuation of particular articles which may not be included in the Tariff Board’s valuations, without having to hold the goods up until the Board can be called together to fix a valuation* You will remember that paragraph 2 of this Article was the result of lengthy discussions in the London negotiations, and I should doubt if the Sultan could be induced to agree to any substantial amendment of it, if it is kept* Article 6(4). Watts* suggestion would seem to put the Muscat Customs in the position of always having their way in the last resort, and it would seem preferable to say e.g. ’’Should the experts be unable to agree as to the choice of an umpire, the umpire shall be chosen by agreement between the consular officer of His Majesty and the Omani* Customs authorities^ the'port of importation”. We have also considered the letter of 8th June from the External Affairs Department of the Government of India, sent me under your reference P.L.4151/38. Only one point in this interests us, viz. the suggestion that such a provision as /Article 2 -'ft/J Article 2, paragraph 1, is ordinarily held not to include participation in coasting trade. We do not know on what grounds this suggestion is made - in our treaties, where the coasting 3 Articlsi Sotiatk s rade is to he excepted from the national treatment provisions, we always regard a specific exception as necessary for the purpose. Article 3(3) of the present draft Treaty gives British shipping full national treatment and no exception is made for coasting trade. Therefore the object apparently desired by the Government of India is, we think, already secured. Yours sincerely. :ii the ooi! authoritiisit X (T 7716/96/373) (*sjp L' | ^ %’'wi4pzx^c- l yi*' fi^L~ l/ V^^Aa/) C '' FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 16th June, 1938. ff ini &lt;i-oii L r&gt; i Dear Gihson, With reference to your letter to Baggallay No. P#Z.3979/38 of the 9th June about privileges for the Consul at Muscat, we are inclined to think: that it would he a mistake to endeavour to persuade the Sultan to concede favours which are not enjoyed by British consular officers elsewhere* Having regard to the possibility that in the event of the appointment of a Muscat! Consul in India, the Government of India might be faced with a demand for reciprocal treatment, it seems to us that they would be well-advised to give careful consideration to Sir Trenchard Fowle f s proposals in the light of the treatment accorded to foreign consular officers in India generally, which should in its turn take account of the principles applied in the United Kingdom. These principles, as you probably know, deny to foreign consular officers any title to exemption 1 ENCLOSURE ,M ,v, * !, Gibson, Esq. rai, DLrT. 17 JUN1938 MDiA OFFICE -o. ol.

Free entry for all his personal requirements is not necessarily of importance to the Consul though it might he to the Government of India, in saving them from having to compensate him for the high cost of living, hut we feel that the desire of the Government of India to avoid such expenditure would not he a valid reason for claiming franchise and if this were to he granted, it would he the first thing a Muscati Consul in India would like, and presumably about the last thing the Government of India would wish to concede. fe do think, however, that there is a good case for the proposals under t B* in Sir Trenchard Fowle’s letter, which deals with restricted or prohibited goods. In this respect there is fair ground for asking that the Consul and his staff shall not he deprived of the enjoyment of commodities which for reasons of climate and national habithabit they could not forego without discomfort and possible prejudice to their health and well-being and that they should therefore be permitted to import such goods in reasonable quantities without restriction* Yours sincerelyI 4 r &amp; 'P® p e S. 1 , I 1 I '• mm a ■ It ■ p i i . ^ -•-■ -• ~ | p GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. : “'* 1 * I %J jStynfidential* wi 4lR 1 i i External Affairs Department. ; 'b-h ! ^ EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). rxr in This is an ORIGINAL message sent by AIR MAIL which provides a means of communication more ^expeditious than the ordinary mail and is cheaper than the telegraph.

P.Z 3735/3^ end our discussion at the India Office last week, I forward herewith my remarks on the provisional draft Treaty with Muscat, as desired. Yours sincerely S.W.l.1 The Sultan in the course of several conversations v/ith me on the subject of the jurisdiction of nationals other then those defined in the 1891 treaty mentioned that he intended to press for jurisdiction over the subjects of the Persian Gulf Sheikdoms on which he said he felt rather strongly. The procedure hitherto followed in Muscat has been somewhat variable. In numerous instances subjects of the Persian Gulf Sheikdoms have been sent to the Agency for trialhut perhaps more often they have been tried in the Muscat Government Courts without reference to the .Agency. In none of these conversations with me did the Sultan claim jurisdiction over the subjects of the .Aden Protectorate and Zanzibar. I think in the present instance this is merely a ‘‘try on' of his and in my opinion should be resisted. The Sultan never objected in the past (as of course he could not do under the terms of the I 89 I treaty) to subjects of the Indian States being considered as British Subjects and it seems to me that since Zanzibar and the Aden Protectorate States are apparently in precisely similar positions to those of the Indian States that the nationals of the former should be accorded the same privilege of protection and jurisdiction over them as those of the Indian States. I think it would have an unfortunate effect in Muscat locally if people who are, after all? genuine Britisht protected persons should he deprived of the benefits of British jurisdiction, a nd my opinion is that the Sultan, if pressed, would drop his claim for jurisdiction over the subjects of these States. Article 1 (iv) and The above remarks will of course apply to Article 19* the marginal notes of Article 1 (iv) and of .Article 19* Article 2 * The alteration in this Article compared with the corresponding one in the old treaty is, I think, an excellent one in particular respect to the necessity of would-be • travellers notifying the local authorities of their intended movements in outlying parts of the Sultanate, and of failure to do so being at their own risk. Article 4. The effect of the first part of this Article, that is to say regarding conditions under which immovable prope rty may be a cquired , will I consider result inevitably in frequent restrictions and obstacles being imposed upon British nationals. The Sultan, I know, feels strongly upon this question and imagines that British subjects have for sometime past been acquiring too much valuable property in his dominions and thereby automatic ally freeing themselves from any form of control by the Muscat State Authorities and for that reason I do not think it will be of much use to press for complete equality in this respect with Muscati subjects as has been done as regards movable property. The latter is really the important one because British 2 .rticle 5 (3) • interests in Muscat are almost entirely concerned with trade, import and export, and the concession obtained from the Sultan as mentioned in the latter part of this .Artiele I consider a very advantageous and real one since they have been put on the same footing ogf the nationals mujfti the Sultan himself. I seems to me, therefore, that the .Article might well be left to stand in its present form and no attempt made to press forjfull equality of treatment with the Sultan’s nationals as regards immovable property. Muring my time in Muscat I have had considerable trouble with the question of additional customs duty being levied at Muscat and MUttra on goods which have already paid duty at some x)ort in the Sultanate where they had first been landed. The grounds for this demand put forward by the Director, of Customs was that in-correct duty had been assessed at the first port. This procedure leads to serious inconvenience to merchants and of course many abuses. If at all possible, I think it would be most advantageous to have some sort of addition made to tnis section whereby it would be clearly laid down that goods once landed and duty thereon Paid viU no further question of ^amount paid oh them l a t whatever port they may have been landed should be allowed to be brought up, and I would suggest some sort of clause as the following, which I think might meet the case - inhere shall be no variation of the customs 3-4 Article J (4-) (lc) Article 5 (6)* Article 6 ( 2 ). h (2o€j '‘dues in any of the Ports of the Sultanate and ’’goods once landed and the duty thereon paid ’’shall not be liable to re-assessaent of duty' This Clause, or an addition somewhat on these lines, though it might appear surprising in a Treaty with another Country, would, I think, not be objected to by the Sultan and it would have the very real advantage of saving what I feel, from experience, will be endless disputes and arguments on this particular point* The period of one month will, in my opinion, hit merchants rather severely and at least I three months should be allowed for the purpose . My remarks regarding Article 5 (4) (b) also epply ^ this Article • Xn tnis case I think three months inadequate a.nd at least six months . shou Id be allo^d* This Clause I an afraid will lead to endless trouble exactly as in the past was experienced over the interpretation of that unfortunate phrase 'Reedy money market' in the eld Treaty. As mentioned in Sub Paragraph ( 3 ) of Article 6 provision h s s been made for the appointment of a TerriCBoard and I would strongly urge that an attempt be made to delete altogether Sub-Paragraph (2) and interpose in Sub-Paregr s .h ( 3 ) some form of expression by which the Sultan undertakes to fix Values for customs purposes solely and entirely by means of this Tarrifi- Board. All British Indian Merchants Pk J II -f IkM 11 Ifti ,7 4 14* itwith whom I have discussed this point were unanimous in welcoming such an institution and the Sultan himself from time to time has stated to me that the idea in principle w&lt;as quite acceptable to him, and I think there is a good chance, if he were pressed, to his agreeing to have all values fixed by the Board .Article 6 (4). I would suggest that some sort of Clause as the following should be added to this sub- article - ‘’Should the experts be unable to agree e s to “the choice of an Umpire the decision of the “Custom House Authorities shall be final“ I suggest this in the light of my experience in numerous cases which have occured where« disputes have arisen between British subjects and the Muscat Customs Au thorities . The experts who would be chosen by(the two parties under this paragraph would, convinced, never be able to agree on any one iU* Umpire in view of the fact that such,*Umpire f s decision would oe final, aud the experts in the Case being as a rule chosen ior their partiality to the party concerned would never agree to place the decision in the hands of an Umpire who would not give a linding in their favour- Such &amp;n impasse would I feel U (&gt; i«T A certain be continually occuring and the only way to settle it, which does not appear to be provided for in this ^Article, would be oy the addition of some such Clause as I have sugge ste d • Article 7 ( 3 ) of the I would suggest that alter the word draft letter as per margin-‘•representation' the words •• with Musc e ti 'interests' be added. The last sentence of this paragraph would appear to be objectionable. The net result;, as I read it, would be to put a weapon in the hands of the Muscat State or of s n unscrupulous person by fraudently joining in a Muse ati national in an administration or personal status Case of straightaway taking the case out of the hands of the British Consular Authorities. The Section requires the case to be referred to the Moslem religious Court apparently without option should a ny other Party to the proceedings be a national of the Sultan, and I am afraid this right would be much abused. The right now given in this Article to the Sultan 1 s Officials to arrest a national of His l^jesty is, I think, quite reasonable and in fact advantageous for the sakeof law and order generally* My own experience is that British nationals have in the past under the old Treaty traded on their immunity from 8 ny form of interference from Muscat Government Officials. I think the safeguards to be laid down in the proposed confidential letter to the Sultan should provide ample safeguards in this matter. My experience is that the Omani Xaws generally speaking are no more severe or onerous in w- their effect that the laws of British India hitherto made applicable to British nationals in Muscat. 6 */ ^file copy p. z.

Advantage was accordingly taken of(His Highness’s recent visit to this country to discuss with him informally the terms of a new treaty to take its place. A copy is enclosed of the draft treaty which has now been sent to His Highness as a result of the discussions. This draft is subject to further consideration on both sides, but, subject to this, it is hoped that the negotiations may be resumed with His Highness in July after his return to Muscat and that they will be concluded in time for the new treaty to be signed there during that month.

We do not object, if you think it necessary, y o u n e excj-Uoion of such persons from the privilege oi trial oy the Consular authorities under Article 13 of the draft Treaty; but we consider that they should be entitled to all the commercial, and trading advantages secured to British subjects, by other articles of the draft, i/e should not, therefore, without consultation with the Aden authorities, willingly agree to the presentation to the Sultan of a draft Treaty which definitely excluded them from these advantages. • GIBSON, BSQ,.

We suggest that it should be amended to read as follows:- ’’That the special Board which will be presided over by the Sultan’s Port Authority shall consist of Omani members and British members in equal numbers”. We realise, of course, that this arrangement will mean that the casting vote will remain always with the Muscat authorities, but that appears inevitable.

E P DONALDSON/—&gt; ,2976/38_ T)IA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 28th April 1938 Muscat Treaty. / / With reference to Gibson’s letter of the 14th April, fed / Ho. P. Z. 2654/38, I am desired to forward a copy of a letter fh / )ril. addressed to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat enclosing a draft representing the results of the informal discussions with His Highness in London in connexion v/ith the revision of the 1891 Treaty. Notes of the meetings held with /His Highness between the 20th and 23rd April are also / ted / enclosed herewith, together with a copy of a letter nd / explanatory of a point in Article 1 (ii) which was sent to the Sultan on the 22nd April. 2. It will be noted that His Highness has been informed that the draft is subject to the views of the Government of India and the further views of His Majesty’s Government. As the discussions have been conducted in close consultation with the Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office/ ' Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE. ,CSX. ,MV0. , Secretary to the Government of India,, External Affairs Department.Office and the Board of Trade it is not expected that any fresh points or criticisms of the draft will be made from here, except possibly with regard to the Sultan’s proposed amendments of Articles 1 and 19, as to which the Colonial Office will wish to consult the Aden and Zanzibar authorities. I am to ask that the draft may be examined as soon as possible in order that any observations which the Government of India may wish to make may be considered here and the necessary instructions issued at an early date for any further discussion with the Sultan that may be necessary, or for the final conclusion of the Treaty. His Highness’ present intention is to reach Bombay at the end of May and after three weeks’ stay there to return to Muscat in the last week of June. 3. The more important changes introduced in the present draft compared with the revised provisional draft of 11th April are as follows:- Article 2 : The paragraphs dealing with monopolies gave much trouble and the present paragraph (2) was the best that the Sultan could be brought to accept. Article 4 : It was found necessary to concede to the Sultan freedom/freedom to impose restrictions with regard to the purchase etc. of immovable property by British subjects which would not be applicable to his own subjects. Articles 5 (7) and 6 (2) : The Board of Trade would not object to these paragraphs as at present drafted and Sir Trenchard Bowie thinks they may be accepted, provided that it is confirmed that the charges referred to in Article 5 (7) are in fact of long standing, as alleged by the Sultan. As Indian traders and Indian trade are the most affected the Government of India may have special views on the paragraphs. Article 7 : The Board of Trade would be prepared to accept this Article (regarding harbour dues &amp;c.) in the light of the assurances which the Sultan is willing to give. Article 9 : With regard to paragraph 3 of this Article, it should be explained that some doubt was felt regarding the inclusion of exception (b) relating to the importation of arms, but the Foreign Office Legal Adviser l and the Board of Trade considered that it might on the whole be as well to retain (b) in view of the possibility that the Treaty might be used by the Sultan as a model for/==y= for treaties with other Powers. Paragraph (3) was therefore retained in its common form. Article 15 (Jurisdiction): The comparatively/ minor points raised hy the Sultan have 'been met. Article 15 : Article 14 of the draft of 11th April was the one which caused most difficulty, and as His Highness’s objections were in great part due to its appearance in a published Treaty it was decided to deal with the essential parts of the Article by means of a confidential letter to which His Highness eventually agreed. 4. Copies of this letter and enclosures are being sent to Fowle at Bahrein and to Watts./ Sir Stewart . Very considerable progress has been made towards the conclusion of a new commercial treaty with Muscat in the informal conversations which Sir T. Fowle and Mr. Gibson have had with the Sultan. In the course of these the F.O. and the Board of Trade have been consulted at all material stages, and also the G.O. and the D.O. where they were concerned. The result is the draft below. If this goes through we shall have succeeded, in the circumstances, in obtaining a very good treaty, especially in view of the fact that the Sultan is in a strong bargaining position, since the old Treaty had expired and is only now kept in force from year to year, the last yearly extension having been obtained with some difficulty from the Sultan. We have yet to obtain the views of the G. of I, on the draft, and there is also one outstanding point, in which the G.O. are interested, which has to be settled. Subject to the settlement of this and any other points which the G. of I. may raise, or which might emerge here, it should not be difficult to conclude/conclude the treaty on the Sultan's return to Muscat unless he changes his mind in the meantime. In order to put on record with him the stage which the negotiations have reached, it seems desirable to give him a letter on the lines of the attached draft. I would propose to sign this, so that Sir T. Fowle can hand it to him at his final meeting with him to-morrow. A note explaining any noteworthy provisions in the draft treaty will subsequently be prepared for submission to the Secretary of State. )cJ ' ' u. 4 .&gt; //' U, Lftjliu CvitutuU 4^ MjM- T&lt;uJj fc y,o. 07FXCE, Co.

(1) In the case of legislation imposing taxes or duties and of municipal or police regulations, the consul will always post the laws or regulations within txvo weeks of the receipt of the request from the Sultan (or within a shorter period in special cases oi urgency) unless the laws or regulations are in conflict with Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 or 10 of the present Treaty, (ii) In the case of legislation imposing customs' duties, unless the law or regulation is in conflict with Articles 3, 5 or 6 of the present Treaty, the consul will post the law or regulation immediately upon receipt of the request from the Sultan and the law or regulation shall become applicable to nationals of His Majesty within such period as the Sultan may direct.

His Highness was unable to agree pointing out that this would mean that nations say of Debai would enjoy trading privileges in his territory while his own subjects would have no corresponding advantages in Debai. The point was left for further consideration. Article S (2) and (3) : A further and unsuccessful attempt was made to secure the Sultan’s acceptance of these paragraphs. He repeated that he had no desire to interfere with trade between Muscat and British territories but insisted on complete freedom to establish monopolies affecting trade carried on inside his territories. The matter was left over. A rticle 4 . The Sultan insisted on his desire to impose restrictions if necessary on the acquisition of immovable property - houses, shops Me. as well as land - by/ Muscat theaty . Bote of Sixth meeting with His Highness the Sultan 20th April. “ ~ ’ Present: His Highness, Sir f. Bowie and Mr. Gibson.'by foreigners ana said he could only accept the present draft if the words nhc nationals of the Sultan or” were deleted. This, as he said, would leawe him free to impose unlimited restrictions on all foreigners alike. He was however willing to substitute for the last four lines the proviso at the end of Article 5 of his own draft. The article was left for further discussion. Article G (2) i The Sultan agreed that a representative of the Board of Trade might be invited to discuss this paragraph with him and Mr. Dulichand. Article 14 ; The Sultan expressed a number of objections to this Article which he said was new and created a very unwelcome impression that there were two governments in his country. He was quite content that British Subjects should be tried in the Consul's Court and he was not interested in the civil and criminal laws applied to them by the Consul. What he did ■want was that British Subjects should, like his own Subjects, be subject to municipal regulations and the like, for example to regulations relating to curfew, prohibition of smoking during Ramadan, motor traffic &amp;c. It was exp 1 ained to h 1 m that tlie Article was considered essentia 1 in consequence of the surrender of the full ex-territorial rights conferred by the existing treaty, that it was considered necessary to provide machinery for removing any doubt as to the laws which were applicable to British Subjects in Muse at, and that His Eighness need have no apprehe nsion that regulations of the kind he referred to would not exhibited and enforced in the Consul's Court against British/British Subjects. It proved very difficult to satisfy the Sultan on these points and further examination of the Article in the light of his views was promised. The next meeting was arranged for Thursday morning 21st April, at 10 a.m.MUSCAT TREATY. The following matters were dealt with: Article 1 (ii ) : It was explained to the Sultan* with reference to his enquiry at the fifth meeting, that (a) the rights to he granted to companies under the proposed draft are solely rights of the companies as such and would not in any way limit his jurisidction over non- British employees of the company as individuals, and (b) in the event of a British Company obtaining a concession or contract wherein they accepted the imposition of certain conditions or restrictions by the Sultan's Government the terms of the concession or contract would be upheld in the Consul's court even though the conditions or restrictions involved a surrender of rights which might otherwise have been claimed for the company under the Treaty. He desired to have this explanation in writing anu said that in the light of it he was satisiied with the draft Article. Article 2 (2) and (5 ): The Sultan was asked to substitute for these paragraphs the draft paragraph proposed to nim at the fifth meeting, which it was understood at the time he was prepared to accept, and he was told that we were prepared to take the risk of his using his powers in a Note of seventh meeting with His Highness the Sult an, 21st Apri1. Present: His Highness, Sir T. Howie, Mr. Gibson, and, for the discussion of Article 6 (2) Mr. Shackle (Board of Trade) and Mr. Buiichand.way that would deprive the paragraph of some of its value.

(c) He objected to the inclusion of the last sentence and said it .was suiiiciently covered by the first sentence, which, he said, covered both internal and external trade carried on by bub.tish nationals. He was told that it was understood that he had hitherto always accepted the principle of the last sentence, that in our view it was a quite reasonable as well as a desirable provision in the Treaty, and that it was designed to cover the case of trade carried on say between Muscat and India which was not handled in Muscat by British subjects. Further there was no undue restriction, if indeed any, on the Sultan’s freedom of action, and the clause was one which would be and has been accepted by several countries. It proved impossible to overcome the Sultan’s objections and finally he said he was willing to accept cither the first sentence (subject to the points (a) and (b) above), or the second sentence, but not both, £r, as an alternative to either, the formula suggested to him at the fourth meeting, viz. ,r should the Sultan wish to establish an^ iiionopoi,y in his territory such monopoly will be arranged in such a way that it will not be detrimental to the trade ox nationals of His Majesty”. Article 3 (1 )/3. Article 3 (1 ): The Sultan showed some sign 0 f objecting to 'national' treatment in this paragraph which he said u.i d. not oocui xi* hilt pi © son o i'l'Gci'ty, u@ wns ns'i^od. to turn first to the next Article. . Article 3 was not further discussed but it was inf erred from a passing remarx of tne Siixtan at the end of the meeting that be did not attach much importance to his objection. Articl e 4: The Sultan was informed that we would be satisfied with the formula for the last few lines of this Article vvhich he said at tne fourth meeting he would accept (i.e. national and most favoured nation treatment m respect ox movable property. Most favoured nation treatment only in respect of immovable property). His Highness confirmed that he accepted the formula. (It is thought, though the point was not put to him on this occasion that this will remove his objection to H national' treatment in Article 3 (1)). Artic le 5 ( 6 ) : In addition to 'weighing' the Sultan now wishes to insert 'transit' fees, explaining that both these charges, like the others mentioned, are already embodied in the customs regulations which have been in force in Muscat for many years. He also presses for the omission of the words 'in strict relation to the cost of the services they are intended to cover' at the end of the paragraph, urging that 'on a reasonable scale' is quite sufficient. Art icle 6 (2 ): Mr. Shackle explained at length the reasons for which this paragraph was considered desirable, pointing out that it was in accordance with the almost universal practice, and citing as an example the treaty The provisions in force in Morocco for man matter/4. matter was not of great importance under existing conditions, but it mi gilt well be important in future whe changes were made in the Muscat tariff, and it was very desirable tiiao traders should know on what basis customs duties would be levied. Mr. Dulichand urged that the existing system was satisfactory, easily worked, and well known to all the traders concerned, who would experience much difficulty, as would also the customs staff, in gettin used to the procedure indicated in the draft. It might well be that it would be found desirable to adopt this procedure in the future when considerable changes were made in the tariff, but there was no present intention of making such changes and they would therefore prefer to continue the existing system. Mr. Dulichand was understood to propose that the draft should run n according to their market price (or market valuation) at Muscat . 11 He said the phrase ’’ready money” was a source of dispute, since traders frequently made their sales on three months’ or six months' credit and would argue that the price on which customs duty should be assessed should be, not what they were due to receive at the end of the period of credit, but the smaller price which the goods would fetch if sold at once for cash. It was eventually agreed to leave over the paragraph for consideration by His Highness in the light of the discussion. Article 12 (1) (i v): To meet His Highness the addition of the following words at the end of the Article was proposed and agreed to: ”arm shall so remit the case if any other party to the proceedings is a national oj.. the Sultan”.% 340 b. Article 13 (2 ) : In the first sentence His Highness desired ,T the courts” in place of ”a court” (of the Sultan). For the second sentence it was agreed to substitute the alternative two sentences in the margin. Article 12 (5 ) * To meet His Highness it was proposed to insert, after ”for the prevention of breaches of the peace”, the words ”or a breach of a law or regulation of the Sultan which has been made applicable to nationals of His Majesty under Article 14”. The Sultan could not agree to these words until Article 14 was discussed. Article 14 : This article was discussed at considerable length, and to meet some of the views expressed by His Highness at the previous meeting it was proposed to him that the second paragraph should run ”In the case of police or municipal regulations or of legislation imposing taxes or duties the text of the laws and regulations, or of the relevant provisions thereof, shall always De exhibited „ etc.”. It was represented to the Sultan that this met his practical objections, and the general purpose of the Article and its necessity from our point oi view v/as explained to him. He could not oe brought to accept it, even with the offered deletion of the third paragi aph which, it was explained, was inserted in his own inoeiest. He objected to a new article which showed that there weie two Governments in his State, and he could not ag/ee uo the machinery by which his laws were enf orceaole against British subjects only when exhibited cy the Consul. Certain of his remarks suggested however that bis oo jc^ uion was largely to the appearance oi the Ar tide iu tne Ii v,wty and that he might be less reluctant to accept the principle of the Article if it were embodied in unpublished/ 1 1 ! //MUSCAT TREATY.

After the meeting, however, he indicated his wish to amend the paragraph so that it would read, 'should the Sultan wish to establish any monopoly in any part of his territory such monopoly will be arranged in such a way that it will not be detrimental to the trade in which nationals of His Majesty are at the time occupied in that part of his territory'. ^aqt icle 3 - His Highness now takes exception to the provision according nation al treatment in paragraph (l) though he has no objection to the similar provision in paragraph (2). In paragraph (l) he said that this new provision, which does not occur in the existing Treaty, went much too far, and he was not prepared to waive his objection when it was pointed out that similar provisions occurred in the majority of commercial treaties, including treaties made e.g. with Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom.( It 2 . Article 6 (2) . His Highness said he had not come to any definite conclusion on this paragraph, hut his feeling was that there was no need to disturb a procedure which had been in force in Muscat f'or many years and worked satisfactorily to all concerned. article 12 (3) ; The amendment proposed at the seventh meeting was agreed to, in view of the conclusion reached on Article 14* Article 14 ; A proposal was made to the Sultan that only a short Article should be inserted in the Treaty and that the procedure contemplated in the present article should be agreed upon in an exchange of letters which would be confidential. ^ draft article and draft letter were handed to him.

The Sultan said he had no objection to these 'words if they referred only to m.f.n. , and not to nati rial, treatment. It was proposed to him that these words might be deleted while retaining the provision for ''‘national” treatment and after some discussion the Sultan agreed. article 6 ( 2 ) . ms the Sultan was still unable to accept the draft it was proposed to him that, subject to the views of the Government of India as the party principally interested in trade with Muscat, the following simplified formula might be adopted, ’’according to their market price following the normal usage of trade in Muscat”.

I have read through the notes of your fourth and fifth meetings with the Sultan and your revised draft Treaty, I have only a few remarks, as follows:** Article l(ii)- As regards the point raised on this by the Sultan at the fifth meeting, I think he could he told on (a) that the rights stipulated for companies are solely rights Ip — •: J' y of the companies as such and that they do not in any way limit such jurisdiction as he has over non-British employees as individuals. As to point (b), it is difficult to see exactly what the Sultan means. He might be asked to point to individual Articles of the draft Treaty with which he apprehends that conflict might arise, and also to say how. It might be pointed out to him that, so far as the rights of companies to buy and sell goods are concerned, Article 2(l) explicitly makes these rights subject to such prohibitions of impor w. or export as may be imposed within the terms of Article 3. Article 2(2H3). I s © 6 no objection to your alternative formula and do not think that the Sultan’s criticism of it is Gibson, Esq. /correct. i ?(3 (Iff :' r &gt;i correct.

Note of fourth meeting with Hio Highness the Sultan, 8th April. Present : His Highness, Sir T. Fowle and Mr. Gibson. The following points were dealt with. Article 2(1): In place of the words 'except that, as regards nationals of His Majesty, special permission shall have to he obtained before entering those places in the hinterland of Muscat which owing to conditions of lawlessness and insecurity shall have been notified unsafe by the local authorities” the Sultan, who objected to the phrase on several grounds, was prepared to accept something on the following lines:- ’’Nationals of His Majesty shall, before proceeding from the place where they reside to another place in the territories of tne Sultan, nobiis lug local Omani authorities of the place in wnich they reside, and such authorities shall inform them whether the in t endec destination is suitable for then to travel to or hot I f the authorities in question notify the said nationals in writing that the intended destination is unsui cable, and if the said nationals persist in travelling to their destination, or should they fail to notify the local authorities of their intended movements, then they vx-lI proceed at their own risk /and if harm befall them no claim will lie against the Omani Government/?” (the words in brackets to be omitted if it transpires that the^ ai e covered by ”at their own risk'/. It was explained to His Highness that a provision of this kind was suggested in order to avert the risk of local authorities* nol^-i-,.., e2. up the movements of Indian traders for n,^+„ ins vib s t an t i al re a s o ns. Article 2,(2) a nr] ( tt • „ - iiic Highness asked whether his view would he met by the substitution of some such Phrase as 'Should the Sultan wish to establish any monopoly in nis territory such monopoly will be arranged in such a way that it will not be detrimental to the trade of British subjects.' He at once enquired who was to decide what was 'detrimental' and said he uid not wish to leave open any grounds for disputes betv/eo-n him and Kis Majesty’s Government, \7hen pressed to explain his objections to the present draft he said he had no intention of doing anything which might affect trade between Muscat and British territories, and therefore accepted the principle of the draft article down to the word 'Parties”: but he wished to be freo to institute a monopoly affecting trade inside his territories, and even here he had not in mind anything vaich would interfere with existing trade e. g. that in rice. What he was thinking of was circumstances in which, wishing to encourage the setting up of an ice plant, he should give a monopoly for the manufacture of ^ ce » 01 ‘ J to take another example? a monopoly for liie sale of beef. The paragraphs were left for further consideration in the light of His Highness’s views. A rtgicle 6 (3) &lt; The Sultan said he was willing to ag: to the provision in the existing draft providing; for equal numbers of Muscat! and British Nationals on the board, under the presidency of the Director of the Sultan’s Customs. ee3 ,rticle 12. (l)(i) His Highness proposed the omission of the words 'and courts’*. (1) ,(iv) His Highness ashed for, and was promised, an explanation of 'questions of personal status'. (2) His Highness preferred in the first sentence 'The Courts' of the Sultan. He maintained his objection to the second sentence as a reflection on the standard of justice administered in his courts, and said he could not agree to it even if a reciprocal provision were inserted allowing an opportunity for his representative to be present in the Consul’s court. If a British subject were dissatisfied with the decision of the Sultan’s Court he would have a right of appeal to the Sultan himself. (3) His Highness desired that in the latter part of the paragraph an insertion should be made giving his authorities also the right of entry and search, i.e. that words similar to those in the beginning: of the paragraph should be inserted in the latter part. (4-) After considerable discussion directed to showing l His Highness that the Consul had not a free hand for the deportation of British subjects and that some such provision as was proposed in our draft was necessary in our view the Sultan desired the cancellation of the whole Article. He said he could not agree to any Tirovision requiring the production, or taking, of evidence in connexion with a request of his i or the expulsion of a British subject, and he therefore preierred to withdraw the Article suggested in his draft (Article 19). Article 14 . So far as this Article was discussed it became clear that the Sultan’s objection, at least as suacod by him on this occasion, a/as to the delay v/hich he mignt experience, Qs a result of the proposed procedure, in imposing taxes and above/aloovc all in imposing customs duties. A delay of ton days after publication of the proposed duties would, he said, enable traders to import goods from India before the duties were enforceable and so would deprive him of revenues. Further consideration of the Article was promised. Article 15 . As His Highness maintained his objection to this Article it was agreed that it should be omitted. Article 15. His Highness desired the insertion of a provision relating to nationals of His Majesty in the Sultan’s service which would enable notice to be given to him before they were arrested. Article 18 . The meaning of the words 'without request or compensation' was explained to the Sultan but he pressed for their omission and this was agreed to. The Sultan referred to Article 7 of his draft, regarding harbour dues etc. He was ashed to accept Article 8 of the existing Treaty, but objected on the ground that he wanted, or might want, to raise funds for the improvement of his harbours. He said he was quite willing to leave undisturbed the existing li hts maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Committee. He was prepared to pay a subsidy to cover the cost of the lights which would be deducted from the dues collected by him. He was further prepared to agree that such harbour dues should be levied on a scale corresponding to that levied by international custom, and he would agree to British representation on the special board provided for in nis draft. He was promised that the matter would be considered in tne light of what he now said. The next meeting was arranged for Saturday morning, 9th April^2 ) MUSCAT TTSATY Note of fifth meeting with His Highness the April. Present’ His Highness, Sir T.Fowle and Mr. Gilson. The following matters were dealt with’~ Article 1 : The Sultan ashed that from the term 'persons under His Majesty’s protection” should he excluded the subjects of Koweit ? Bahrein, Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Aden Protectorate and also of Zanzibar, and similarly that these territories should be excluded from the territories under His Majesty’s protection referred to in (iii), (iv) and (v) 4 He wished the exclusion to operate throughout all the Articles of the treaty and nor only in respect of those dealing with personal jurisdiction. He was told that the Government of India would be consulted in respect of the Persian Gulf States, and the Colonial Office regarding the Aden Protectorate and Zanzibar. (ii). His Highness would like a note assuring him, with regard to ’’corporate bodies”, (a) tnat individual employees of a Company, if not Britisn subjects, would be unconditionally subject to his jurisdiction, c-wm (b) that in case of conflict between the terms of a concession given to a Company (or o me a* contract oe ov.een the Sultan and a Company) and the terms of the Treaty, the terms of the concession etc. would, prevail. Subject to the above, His Highness was satisfies.. wiuS. this clause, and also with the reference uO j. egi^txa oicn of British shipping in (iii) 5 in the limit of tne explanations supplied by the Board of iiade. Article 2 (l) . The amendment suggested at the iourth meeting wa s/v/as further discussed. ancL ? with one or two amexidnients accepted hy the Sultan. A rticle 2 (S) a nd (5) . The following alternative was suggested, to the Sultan:- 'The Sultan will not establish in his territory any monopoly in respect of a trade in which nationals of His Majesty are at the time engaged without compensating such nationals for their loss of business either by permitting them to share in the monopoly on equitable terms or otherwise. Further, the Sultan undertakes to secure that any monopoly established by him shall interfere as little as possible with the trade between the territories of the High Contracting Parties.' His Highness had no objection to the second sentence. Further, he said that if we wished it he was quite prepared, to accept the first sentence also, but he pointed out that it left him free on his return to Oman to institute monopolies in every matter in which British Indian traders were not now doing business, thus preventing them from acquiring any claim to compensation in such matters in the future. The question was left over for further consideration and discussion. Article 4 . It was proposed to His Highness that a sentence might be added to the existing draft as follows 'Notwithstanding the' provisions of the previous paragraph of this Article the Sultan may impose restrictions on the purchase of land outside the towns in his territories by nationals of His Majesty orovided that the same restrictions are imposed on■To the nationals of the most favoured foreign country. ,J He said this did not meet him, as he wished to exercise a control over the acquisition by foreigne of immovaole property anywaere, both land and buildings, by requiring, as in his d.rait, that permission should be obtained. He remarked that with the existing draft, with or without the proposed addition, it was 0 pen to him, without inrringenient of the Treaty, to secure his object by issuing orders to his ow r n subjects that no immovable property was to be disposed of to foreigners without his permission. The orders would not apply directly to British subjects: the latter when desiring, say, to hire or purchase a shop, would approach an Omani subject for the purpose, that is, h-!rs dealings would be with a private individual, not with the Omani Government, while the Omani subject before consenting to dispose of the property would refer to the Sultanate authorities for permission. The Sultan would outwardly be controlling only the actions of his own subjects, as he was entitled to do, and yet would be able to secure his object. His Highness therefore suggested the retention of his own draft (i.e. the proviso to his Article 5). Sultan 1 s Article 7 (harbour dues) His Highness proposed, that the three which he was prepared to accept in respect of this Article (see note of fourth meeting) should be recorded in a letter and not in the Treaty itself, since he wished to avoid hampering his freedom in negotiating a treaty with a foreign power (particularly in regard to British representation on the special board). Article 12 fl)fiv) . It was exulained to His Highness that questions4. o -- p g i‘ l- o i id 1 s ua gug X'elateci 'to family lav: gc no rail y (luarriage, divorce ? legitimacy etc. ). He said lie wished that any dis-nite of this kind between Moslems ? e.g. divorce proceedings, in which one of the parties is an Omani,should he tried by Sharia law, i.e. in a Moslem religious court. The Article leaves this optional j_r bno case ox Moslems generally; His Highness wishe-d it to oe obligatory where an Omani is a party to a dispute. Article 12 (2). In place of the second sentence His Highness is prepared to accept a sentence suggested to him provided it runs as follows:- 'The national of His Majesty shall have a right of appeal to the Sultan, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Omani Courts, against any decision given against him in any such case if the Consul of His Majesty shall so reguest. If the Sultan should be absent the appellant may, if he so desires, ask that the appeal may be heard by the Sultan’s representative.” Article 12 (5 ). An amendment to cover the point mentioned by His Highness at the fourth meeting was given to him. He also asked that the proviso in this paragraph should be extended to enable his officials to arrest a British subject who was found breaking a regulation of the Sultan which had been published and communicated to the British Consul. Article 14. His Highness made the following points. He is anxious/anxious to be able to impose customs duties without delay. He would accept an amendment providing that legislation imposing taxes or duties should be exhibited automatically. He would prefer to substitute n for a suitable period 5 ' 1 for the reference to the period of ten days etc. ? leaving the exact period to be settled by an exchange of letters. In the last sentence 5 which would now refer to legislation other than that imposing taxes or duties^ he wished to substitute 'consider the matter' for 'consider the withdrawal of his request or a modification of the law or regulation in question' 9 and was anxious that delay should be avoided in the event of the matter being submitted to His Majesty’s Government. Further ? he wanted liberty to apply to British subjects temporary emergency legislation in the interests of public security. Article 16 . His Highness would accept this Article 5 subject to the deletion of the words 'and sufficient evidence proceeded with' and 'discharge such person from his service' 9 and to the addition of the following sentence.- 'No criminal or civil proceedings shall be taken before the consular authorities of His Majesty against any national of His Majesty in the service of the Sultan unless notice of the proceedings has been previously given to the Sultan or his representative. ' It was agreed that the next meeting should be held on Wednesday 9 20th Aprils aiter t.iu return ox Highness from Paris and that a revised drafu ox the Treaty should if possible be given to him before leaving London.7154/38 ££ .-'£-* C £ C '£ £ £ £ : £: £ ££. £ .V. 1 . 8th April, 1938, &gt; 1 pear Gibson, MUSCAT. I have read the note of the, third meeting with the Sultan. The following observations may perhaps be of some use to you. Article 2, paragraphs 2 and 5. It is, of course, a gross exaggeration for the Sultan to say that these paragraphs about monopolies would leave him no free hand. All they say is that he will notify us if he intends to set up a monopoly, with a view to avoiding interference with trade as far as possible, and that the question of compensation, if it arises, shall be settled by agreement with him or by arbitration. It might be worth pointing out to him, if you have not already done so, that reciprocal obligations of this character have been in existence as between Siam and ourselves since 1925, and that in the recent revision of the Anglo- Siamese Treaty the Siamese Government accepted an obligation to grant equitable treatment in respect of any measures they might take affecting the property, rights or interests legally acquired by British subjects and in respect of compensation for such measures (Article 10(1) of the new Treaty jfbson, Esq. /Cmd.r 57l?%’7 7-?. ' , Its T ZTZ ^$ f/}tV* . * ,. Cmd.5608), and that in notes attached to the Treaty (Nos* 1 and 2) they have agreed that under any monopoly they may set up the commerce of the United Kingdom shall receive fair and equitable treatment, and that in making its foreign purchases any such monopoly will be influenced solely by commercial considerations. (Both Article 10 and the Exchange of Notes are, of course, reciprocal in form). Article 4, I do not know how far you wish to press the Sultan to grant national treatment in respect of immovable property, but certainly the phrase he suggests is as far as we should be prepared to go in negotiating a bilateral treaty with any fully independent foreign country, and if his claim is accepted in principle then I think the drafting of his phrase is all right. Article 5(4)(b). I should regard it as preferable everywhere to say * consigned* only, as is the regular practice in all our modern treaties, but I doubt if there is any substance in the point. Article 6(2). I think it should be pointed out to the Sultan that the position as 1 regards the Customs valuations is radically changed by the fact that he is now to get tariff autonomy whereas up to now he has been limited to /importimport duties of 5%. So long as this limitation lasted the inclusion in the valuations of this very small limited margin representing the import duties did not matter, hut once he espeot e he secures tariff autonomy every increase that he makes in the import duties will atomatically he added on to the valuations on which those duties are based, thus producing a cumulative effect* It may indeed he said that it is the universal practice in other countries expressly to exclude the amount of the Customs duties and incidental charges from the valuations and, as an example, the Sultan might he shown the following i extract from the Act of Algeciras of 1906 which is, of course, an international agreement regarding Morocco. The second i! paragraph of Article 95 of the Act reads as follows foreign hen I as prefers! he regular doubt if n The ad valorem duties ahall he paid on the basis of the cash and wholesale value of the goods entered at the customs-house, free of customs and warehouse duties* In the case of damaged goods, the depreciation they have undergone shall he taken into account in their valuation”. In the last resort it seems to me that you might agree to say ”the ready money market price at Muscat”, hut that you ought to insist on adding the qualification ”less the Customs duties payable on importation”* Article 8, paragraph 5(h). So long as this Article remains unilateral the effect of omitting this exception in respect of the traffic in arms will, of course, merely he that the Sultan will have to treat us on a purely most favoured natior basis* To that, it seems to me, we need not object on our /ownown account, but the omission of the exception may possibly land the Sultan in difficulties 'pother countries with which he negotiates, and to which he may not he willing to grant most favoured nation treatment in the matter of arras » traffic, follow suit dn insisting on the omission of this exception* I am sending a copy of this letter to Beckett. Yours sincerely,.P.T, 7154/38 Dear Gibson, % I (0 (r*. h k. SuiU^. liG.UU2 01- Ttl^OE, (31 ^ o CEO.vCE STllEET 7th April, 1938, Draft Muscat Treaty* The answers to the two queries put to you by the Sultan on the Definitions Article (Art.l) should, I suggest, be as follows:- (l) Definition of ’nationals* as including corporate bodies, Nowadays trade is of course carried on, at any rate in countries such as the United Kingdom with a highly developed economic structure, by companies at least as much as by individuals, and this will more particularly be true ?/here international trade is concerned. In these circumstances it is necessary, and is now the invariable practice, for H.M. Government in their commercial treaties to stipulate for rights of companies as well as rights of individual subjects. For this purpose it is necessary to define the companies to which the treaty provisions are applicable, and this is regularly effected, both in United Kingdom treaties and in those concluded by other Powers, by defining them as those corporate bodies which are incorporated under the law of the particular territories to which the treaty applies: thus, for example, in relation to the United Kingdom, the present Gibson, Esq. /definitionoi definition will make the treaty applicable to companies jtisifl there registered under United Kingdom law, and in relation to India? to companies registered under the law of India. The term •nationals’ has been used in the present draft as a convenient expression to embrace both individual subjects and companies^ but as the case of companies is naturally not always comparable with that of subjects, the draft definition specifies that the word ’nationals’ shall include corporate bodies only in relation to certain Articles of the draft which are appropriate to companies as well as to individuals. (2) As regards the definition of ’British vessels’ in para.(iii) of Article 1, this again is common form in treaties concluded by H.M. Government. The law regarding registration as a British ship is uniform throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations in requiring that a ship shall not be deemed to be a British ship unless owned wholly by persons of the following description, namely, (a) natural-born British subjects, (b) persons naturalized by or in pursuance of an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or by or in pursuance of an Act of ordinance of the proper legislative authority in a aetherPe latii lia, ift to the laws of,some part of Majesty’s dominions, and having their principal place of 'business in those dominions; thus, there is no possibility that (as the Sultan apprehends) a Muscat! might secure registration of his ship as a British ship, whether under the law of Australia or of any other part of the Empire.

As so little time was left at yesterday*s meeting to discuss Board of Trade points I am writing in order to put our views more fully on record than I was ahle to do then* Article 2(2). If this paragraph is to Toe made 'bilateral I suggest that it might' he reworded:- 'Each H.G.P. undertakes to* inform the other of his intention to establish in his territories any monopoly liable to involve interference with the trade between the territories of the respective H.C*P t s, or with trade carried on in the territories of the one H.G.P* by nationals of the other, with a view to avoiding such interference as far as possible? Article 6(2). Customs Valuation. The objection to the omission of the word 'wholesale' is that it would leave the way open for the inclusion of retailers* profits in Muscat„ thus inflating the valuations. The point would, of course, he of definite importance if you were seeking conventional isations of any of the Muscat Customs diities, but as you are not, and since Muscat, now that she has tariff autonomy, could always offset any reduction in the Customs valuation by * + increases of the ad valorem rates of duty, it seems that ’the Gibson, Ssq. ‘ /chiefch.i©f consideration siionld t)e to avoid as ±ar as possible uncertainty in the minds of traders as to the amounts of the duties which they will have to pay* This uncertainty coufd oerhaps 'be avoided if Muscat could he persuaded to adopt the Indian valuations (contained in the Customs Tariff which is issued periodically hy the Department of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics) together with the formula on which those valuations are based (i*e* Section 30 of the Sea Customs Act of 1878). Moreover, this would seem a logical course in view of the extent to which Muscati merchants purchase their supplies wholesale in India. However, if this should not he found feasible -ind if is found unavoidable to drop the mention of ’♦wholesale” from the present formula, we should not in the last resort object on behalf of the United Kingdom. Article 18. The words ’’without request or compensation are for practical purposes only a explanation of ’’immediately and unconditionally”. So soon as, say, Muscat gives a concession to Prance she must give it to us, immediately i*e# without waiting for a request from us, and unconditionally i.e. without seeking to exact any counter-concession from us in return. The word ’’compensation”, therefore, practically /amountsin India, Jasilile ail: the last re: amounts to the same thing as n counter-concession* 1 , hut as the phrase is a well established one which has been in regular use ever since the Peace Treaties we should prefer not to alter it. If necessary ’‘without request or compensation** could be dropped and the words “immediately and unconditionally** might alone he retained provided that their significance as explained above is clearly understood. Light and Harbour Dues. On this subject we have nothing to add to what was said in my letter of S5th March on the Sultan*s Article 7, except that we should be satisfied if you can manage to secure the re-inclusion of Article 8 of the 1891 Treaty together with the provision for national and most favoured nation treatment for British ships in the third i paragraph of Article 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Beckett. Yours sincerely, st or cop scat givesiITcte of third fuscat Treaty, .eeimg with His Highness the Sultan. 7th Aaril. hr e sen ^ nis mgnness , Sir T. Towle, and Mr. Gibson It was suggested, and His Highness agreed, that the most convenient plan to those concerned for the conduct of the discussions after the 11th April would be for His Highness to go to Paris, as arranged, on the 12th April, spend a week there and return to London on the 19th or 20th April. Sir T. Fowle said he would in the circumstances postpone his departure until the 27th April. The draft Treaty previously left with His Highness was then taken up and the following Articles were discussed: Art.1 ; (i) Tor the final words His Highness said he definitely preferred 'Oman and its Dependencies' 1 , omitting the reference to Huscat. (ii) Plis Highness took strong exception to the inclusion in the definition of '-British protected persons' f or the purposes of the Treaty of the natives of the territories in Arabia under Pi is Majesty’s protection, particularly the natives of Howeit, Bahrein, Qatar, tne Trucial Coast and the Aden Protectorate. About Palestine He f b. with his position as an independent Arab Kuler if the Arabs of the neighbourin c t err it ories were withdrawn from his jurisdiction. He was not satisfied with the explanation that Eis 'Majesty’s Government were bound to give to tne natives of the territories named above the same protection in foreign countries as would be given to j.-.ri oisn. subjects. As regards co rporate po d ies His Hignness was ^old thcx-t this definition was common form and was essential in a commercial treaty. Despite the explanations given xis still wished/ he was not sure. He felt that it would be inconsistentwished to think the matter over and asked to be supplied with a written explanation of phrase. He was told that the to supply this. the meaning and effect of the Board of Trade would be asked i.n (iii) (iv/ and (v) uis Highness again represented that territory under the protection of His Majesty should not include the territories of the Arab States under Kis Majesty’ protection. In (iii) His Majesty objected to the phrase, ships registered ’’under the law of any part of the British Commonwealth &amp;c.” His objection appeared to be that it might be possible for a Muscat! to secure for his dhow the treatment accorded to British ships by having the dhow given through the British Consul a registration, e.g. in Australia or Canada. He suggested the substitution of the phrase - registered ”in the territories of His Majesty”. The real objection to this amendment (that in virtue of the definition of ’’territories” it would exclude from the definition of British ships ships registered in the Dominions which do not accede to the Treaty) was not explained to His Highness but he was told that his fears were unfounded, that it was believed that British law would require the owner of the ship to be domiciled (or if a company, registered) in the territory in question, and that the phrase in the draft was common form. He asked that here also he might be given an explanation in writing and was promised that this too would be sought from the Board of Trade. Article 2 (1): His Eighness pressed his previous objections to the insertion of the words ,f in the hinterland of Muscat”. He also wished to delete the word ’’ lawlessness ” and the reference to n ot i f i cat i o n. He said that. Indian traders were settled at various ports in Cman and he had no wi sh/wish to turn them out. But difficulty might arise when a trader wished to go to some other place in his territory which Indian traders did not frequent; he might not be in a position to protect such persons and yet would be held responsible by His Majesty’s Government if anything happen© to them. After much discussion he said he would not object if an arrangement was made by which an Indian trader, wishing to move to some other place in Oman, should be required to inform the local authorities, who might in certain cases think fit to notify him that owing to conditions of insecurity the place proposed to be visited was unsafe, and if it was understood that no responsibility for the person’s safety attached to the Sultan’s Government if, notwithstanding the notification, he should proceed to carry out his proposed visit. The Sultan drew attention to the phrase regarding the conditions and regulations applicable to his nationals when visiting the territories of His Majesty and claimed that he should not be denied any right of controlling the movements of British subjects within his territory, vnere conditions were much more insecure. (2) and ( 3 ): Hig Highness complained, almost bitterly, that these paragraphs about monopolies would leave him no free hand. He was not interested in an offer to make tnern reciprocal, as he had no trading interests iimely affected by British monopolies. Only about a third oi Muscat trade was in the hands of British Indian tracers, r. is own pe 0 pie would therefore 0 e proportiona.u© 1 j «^ 0 ^ than British sobjects by the creation 01 monopolies. was, however, very anxious to avoid disturbing trade; on the contrary he wished to see trade between India and Muscat increase. It was represented to him that by the present draft His Majesty’s Government were making a consideraole advance/ 4rO j4. / If-Ogy advance in that the 7 were withdrawing the existing prohibition on nonopelies ana were anxious to insert the present paragraphs only as a safeguard against any serious disturbance of trade or of the interests of British traders which might result from tin freedom to 'eate mono noli he exercise of the Sultan's For this reason they attached importance to the inclusion of these paragraphs, file Sultan gave no inaication that he was prepared to accept the paragraphs, which were left over for further di scussi on. A rticle 5 . The Sultan has no objection. Article 4 . His Highness is anxious to draw a distinction between immov 0 ab1e and moveab1e pr 0 perty, giving rn.f.n. treatment in respect of both but national treatment only in respect of the latter. He would accept the Article if the last phrase ran, n on the same conditions in respect of immoveable property as are or may be established with regard to the nationals of the most favoured foreign country and in respect of moveable property as are or may be established with regal'd to the nationals of the Sultan or the nationals of the most favoured foreign country 11 . Article 5&lt;, ( 4) (b ) For the phrase 11 not being consigned” , which in the Sultan’s draft was amended to ’’not being manifested and consigned”, he now wishes to substitute the phrase in Article 5 (4) (a), vis. !, not being destined and manifested”. Article 5 (6 ) His Highness explained that ”landing fees' were'Aaid to the man who performs lighterage (which is given out on contract). i'he worn 'or' should be inserted between 'wharfage' and 'ground rent', the latter being levied in the ports where there were no wharves, and either term being equivalent to demurrage or warehousing charges/charges. His Highness repeated that neighing charges were introduced in the reorganisation of the Muscat customs in 1920, and should he retained. Article 6 (2 ). His Highness said again that the term 'wholesale 1 ' is meaningless in Muscat, and argued that the qualification 'less the customs duties payable on importation' would in effect deprive him of a certain amount of revenue which he had derived in the past, and would only pat some extra profit into the pockets of the traders who would continue to sell at the old retail price^while paying less duty. He would not object to 'ready money retail market price' but otherwise preferred no change. His attention was drawn to the Indian practice as shown by sections 22 and 30 of the Indian Sea Customs Act, 1873, and he was told that the draft was an attempt to introduce a more rational procedure based on the recognised practice elsewhere. His Highness, however, insisted that what was a suitable system for highly developed conditions elsewhere was not appropriate to the conditions in Muscat, and he therefore wished things to go on as in the past. Arti cle 6 (3) . His Highness said that he now thought it unreasonable, seeing that Indian traders dealt with only a third of Muscat trade, that the tariff board should consist of equal numbers of the Sultan’s subjects and British subjects. He would prefer to amend his draft so that the numbers of either nationality were proportionate to their interest in Muscat trade. It was represented to him that it would oe very difficult to give effect to such a provision and further that, under the Sultan’s own proposal, the tariff ooard consi^t-ed of five persons so that British subjects were in a permanent minority. This did not seem to move His Highness who said he would think the matter over. Article 7. His Highness has no objection.4-oE j is rlignness proposed the addition o~ r/ords n or religious oeliei M at the end of para. 3 1°) , not press it when it was explained to him that paragraphs (l) and (2) allowed him power to impose any prohibitions or restrictions on imports provided there was no discrimination against His Majesty’s Government. He said that he was thinking of such a thing as alcoholic liquors. He agreed that whatever prohibition he put on the importation of alcoholic liquors would not extend to prohibiting such importation for the use of the British Consulate. His Highness suggested the omission of para.3 (b) dealing with traffic in arms, etc. His suggestion was noted for consideration. Art icle 9 : ITo objection. Article 10 : o objection.

Present? His Highness the Sultan, The Political Resident (Sir Trenehard Fowls), and Hr. J.f.Gibson (India Office). Sir Trenchard Fonle began by saying tnat His Hajesty's Government welcomed, as he understood the Sultan did also the opportunity afforded by the presence of His Highness in London to have an informal discussion of the Sultan's proposals for the revision of the 1891 Treaty and to explain to His Highness the conclusions which His Majesty’s Government had provisionally reached in the light of the views expressed by the Government of India. The matter had been discussed that very morning by the Departments concerned, and, while an important part of the Treaty proposals had still to be examined by them, he was able to give the Sultan His Majesty’s Government's provisional draft of the earlier articles of the Treaty. Sir Trenchard then gave His Highness a draft, as in the copy attached herewith, of the Preamble and Articles 1 to 10. He explained that there was no question of the Sultan committing himself at this stage and that he proposed, after going through the draft and explaining the variations from the Sultan's proposals, to leave it to be considered by His Highness at his leisure. He then proceeded to explain the draft Article by Article. The Sultan’s comments were as follows Preamble : no comment. Article l(i): For the phrase 'Muscat and Oman and Their/Their Dependencies' His Highness said he xras inclined to prefer simply it Oman u . AfMfLef—LCLiJ-Phrase ;: all persons under His Majesty's protection puzzled His Highness who remarked that it was more extensive tnan the phrase in the existing Treaty (which was limited to cue subjects of the Indian States) and said that he would wish to have a definition of it 3 as otherwise he might be at a loss to know whether he or nis Majesty s Consul was entitled to have jurisdiction over a particular person. With regard to the definition of the Sultan's subjects His highness thought it should cover all persons under his jurisdiction^ i.e. in addition to his own subjects, foreigners in his territory other than British subjects and British protected persons. It was explained to him that the term “Nationals of His Majesty' did not include foreigners who being in British territory were subject to His Majesty's jurisdiction. The Sultan apparently thought that some such phrase was needed to balance the reference to persons under His Majesty’s protection. He wished to consider the extension of the term 'Nationals' to cover 'corporate bodies'. Article 1(iii) : For 'Muscat!' His Highness preferred 'Omani', and wished the definition of his ships to read 'all ships registered by the Oman Government and entitled to fly the flag of the Sultan'. Article l(iv) ; His Highness tnought it would be desirable to insert a definition of Omani Aircraft. Article 2( 1); His Highness pressed for the omission of the words 'in the hinterland of Muscat'. For/For the words 'of all foreigners' at the end of the second sentence he preferred a reference to the most favoured nation ('of the nationals of the most favoured foreign country'). .( 2 ) anci jL3_)p His Highness wished to think over these provisions regarding monopolies (particularly with reference to the question of compensation) and desired to knov^ whether they occurred in other Treaties. He was informed that this was so and that the provisions 'i/ere in fact based on those in a recent Treaty with His Majesty’s G-overnment. Article 5 (4)(b): His Highness wished to consider whether one vords manifesced and consigned' which awoeared in his draft ought to be retained. Article 5(5) ; For the proposed 'Six' months at the beginning of this paragraph His Highness preferred to retain the ‘’three' months of his draft explaining that warehousing space in Muscat was very limited and that embarrassment might be caused if goods were allowed to lie in it for so long as six months. Art tele 5 (6) ° His Highness promised to give an explanation of the terms used in his draft? which had been supplied to him by his Director of Customs. He ' r saio. that all these fees? including t/eighing charges? had been levied at Muscat for many years past by an arrangement approved by the T^litical Agent. To cut out an item like ''weighing charges' would therefore be to deprive him of a right which he already enjoyed. Sir Trenchard observed that presumably His Highness referred to the reorganisation of the Muscat Customs ty an Officer of the Indian Customs Service in about 1920 /4. 1920. His Highness confirmed t-is. —§—,(41 * His Highness wished to omit the \/ord ^wholesale 9 explaining that it had no meaning in Muscat, where all one trade was retai1 trade, the merchants buying wholesale in India and selling in small quantities in Muscat. Article / o His Highness wished to consider this further. Article 6 (3 )« His Highness wished to consider this ’’exceptions” paragraph further. Apart from the above comments His Highness raised no objection to Articles 1 to 10 on his first reading of them. It was arranged that the next meeting should be held on Friday, 1st April at 4.45 p.m.MUSCAT TimAH-’V Note of second meeting with the Sultan- -S U April. Present: H.H.the Sultan* sir and Hr. J.P.g _ Irene hard Powle ibson. The remaining Articles of the provisional reoraft of the Treaty were given to the Sultan (as in the copy attached) and wei e briefly explained to him. Article 11. His Highness suggested the insertion of the word 'possible' before 'aid' or 'assistance' in paragraphs (l) and ( 2 ). A£ll£le 12 (2). Although it was pointed out to His Highness that there was nothing in this paragraph to fetter his jurisdiction he objected to the inclusion of the second sentence unless accompanied by a reciprocal provision for the attendance of a representative of His Highness at the hearing by the British Consul of proceedings instituted against a British subject by one of his subjects. He said that it would always be open to a British subject who thought he had been unjustly treated to appeal to the British Consul to make representations on his behalf. Article 12 ('4). His Highness objected to the latter Part of this paragraph* stating that he would not ask for the expulsion of a British subject without good reason and that his request ought to be accepted without being subjected to investigation by the British Consul Article 15 . pis Highness wished to insert the word 'Possible' before 'aid'. Art icle 14 . His Highness took exception to the second ail d tnird sentences* which he said would put him in an awkward position because they differentiated too much in favour/sSir T.Fov/le pointed out that he did not think that the delay was due to us 5 as we had heen waiting for the list of taxes and. rules from the Muscat Government. favour of British subjects. .He v;as anxious to give equality of t re a t : .ler.t - Tout these provisions vould. make it imp os si ole _or him to ant i c ip a te that a neu tax v/ould. a Pply to all alike, and. if the procedure contemplated in the last sentence mere carried out years might elapse before taxes could, be imposed on British subjects. His experience with regard to the introduction of municipal taxation did not encourage him to think that the delay entailed, by the procedure would be only negligible. x Article 15 . His Highness would prefer the omission of this Article, which he said would put him in an awkward position notwithstanding that no effect could be given to it without his consent. Article 16 . His Highness w/ished to consider this further. Article 17 . His Highness had no comments. Article 18 . His Highness could not understand the last four words. (it will be explained to him that these words only mean that most-favoured-nation treatment must be extended to British subjects without waiting for any request for it on their part and without making it conditional on some counter-consideration to be given by them.). Articles 19-21 . His Highness desired to consider these further. There was not time to explain item in detail, but he was told that they were common form in treaties now made by H. M. G-. Article 22 . His Highness appeared disappointed at the provision that the Treaty would not come into force before next February. He was informed that it arose from the circumstance/ 4 *4circumstance that certain Dominions «ere a party to the existing treaty, and that, if it were proposed to terminate the present treaty before the end of the period for which it was extended consultation with the Dominions concerned would be necessary and would probably entail such delay as might in any case prevent the new Treaty from corning into force before next February, It -was arranged that the next meeting should be held on Wednesday morning., 6th April.The Suitan ol Tuscat and Oman and Dependencies (hereinafter referred to/ C2SCATTRJ3A T Y« Provisional draft .

Similarly A r tS cles 2 and 10 of the French Treaty put the French on an equal footing with the _%r&gt;eriearns. The wording of .Article 2 paragraph 8. like all the other Articles of the draft Treaty^ which has been prepared by the aultaa himself) has a very wide implication and is most categorical, and would seem to override any possible preferential advantages or privileges given to French or American subjects by their respective Treaties which are not specifically accorded to British subjects in those Articles of the draft Treaty in which the phrase *roost favoured nation* 1 might have been included, but has been omitted« Article 1 5. &gt;eath of a British subject.

Under Article Z of the same Treaty french subjects anywhere in the State of Muscat have all the privileges which are enjoyed by the most favoured nation* The draft Treaty, however, allows for municipal taxes to be levied on all residents without distinction of nationality. In consequence both French and the United States ox Africa are better favoured nations than Great Britain, and again recourse could be had to ^Krt 1 ole Z paragraph 2 of the draft Treaty to level conditions to the standard of those of the 'moat favoured nation'.

K1NGSWAY. W.C.2. March, 1938. Dear Gibson, I am replying to your letter No. P.Z.1736/38, dated 17th March, to Russell on the subject of the revision of the Muscat Treaty of 1891. We agree that a ne\v sub-paragraph (3) of the third paragraph of Article VI, as set out in your letter under reply should be substituted for the existing sub-paragraph. It seems to us, however, that there is a case for freepmg the whole of Article VI applicable to imports oy air as well as by sea and perhaps you will consider this when you come to discuss the terms of the new Treaty with the Sultan or his 9 representatives. We would also like to see Article XI revised to include aircraft, and I attach a draft which might perhaps serve as the basis for a new Article XI. As time is short, I sand you the enclosed without further delay although it is admittedly somewhat hurriedly drafted. It does, at least, show what we want and there will no doubt be time to give it better shape before it eventually ir# vrlCSOil 9 ~ 7 India Office White 1.Highness shall, as soon as they come to itnow thereof, Draft Article XI British vessels or aircraft entering a port in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, in distress, or British aircraft in distress at an^ place in His Highness f dominions, shall receive from the local authorities all necessary aid to enable them to revictual, refuel, and refit so as to proceed on their voyage or journey. wrecked off the coast of His Highness’ dominions, or a British aircraft be in distress at any place in His Highness’ dominions, the authorities of His Highness tressed vessel or aircraft in order to save the ship or aircraft, her cargo, and those on board, they shall also give aid and protection to persons saved, and shall assist them in reaching the nearest British Consulate; they shall further take every possible care that the goods so recovered are safely stored, and kept for the purpose of being handed over to the owner, captain or British Consul, subject always to rights of salvage. His Highness’ authorities shall further see that the British Consulate is at once informed of suen disaster having occurred. Should a British vessel or aircraft be shall render all assistance in their power to the disT- ( of the ship or aircraft, agent of the ship or aircraft, Should a British vessel or aircraft, wrecked on the coast of His Highness' dominions, or a British aircraft in distress at any place in His nighness' I dominions, he plundered, the authorities of Hisi»enaer prompt assistance and take measures to pursue and punish the roDuers and recover the stolen property. Likewise, should a vessel or aircraft of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, or one of his subjects, enter a British port in distress, or be wrecked off the coast of His Majesty’s dominions, or should an aircraft of His Highness or one of his subjects be in distress at any place in the territory of His Majesty’s dominions, the like help and assistance shall be rendered by the British authori~ ti es •T. 576/15 Terch, 1938. pear Baggal^syt Thank you for your letter B. ?301/689/91 of the 22nd March about the proposed new CoMercial Treaty with ,/us oat. we were not previously ©ware that the Sultan had signified his desire to terminate the 1891 Treaty and to negotiate a new Treaty in its place. My letter to Hbson No. T.576/11 of the 15th ^ureh, in which we eteted our view ttot the consent of Canada and Sire should be obtained to any modification of the 1891 Treaty, was written on the understanding, based on the wording of the Sultan's letter of the 1st April, 1957, of which a copy was enclosed in India Office letter Ho. P.2. 44S6/57 of the 12th July,195?, that it was revision of the Treaty thet the Sultan desired, and we assumed that the 1891 Treaty would be kept in force. 2. We agree, however, that, if the treaty of 1891 could be allowed to terminate, and could then be followed by a new Treaty negotiated in the first place between the t i ■* ci r»-P thf* 0116 D©rt ©QO HU8 CBt» of 'fch# United kingdom and India of t.ic. other, GGALLAY, BSQ.other, the procedure, especially where Canada and .ire are concerned, would he very much simpler. We have not so far traced in the Dominions Office the notice of denunciation by the Sultan of the 1891 Treaty, hut presumably the mere fact that it has been thought necessary to renew the Treaty at intervals since 1914, if not an ea ^ ier &amp; a te* would justify the argument that, failing renewal, it would terminate. We therefore welcome the suggestion that a new Treaty should 'be negotiated to take effect on the 11th February, 1939, and that the 1891 Treaty should be allowed to l&amp;ps.e on that date. 4. If this suggestion is adopted, it would appear that Article 1 of the Indie Office draft Treaty, enclosed in Gibson* e letter No. P.Z. 1736/38 of the 17th March, should be omitted. If any declaration of the termination of the 1891 Treaty is thought necessary, we suggest that this would be better made separately from the new treaty, or else put into the preamble. 5. With reference to paragraph 7 of your lett r, we would propose, when we get the copies of the document renewing the 1891 Treaty for a year from the 11th February, 1938, to inform the Dominions that the Sultan hashas expressed his unwillingness to renew the Treaty after the 11th February, 1939. 6. perhaps for the sake of completeness, *e ought also to consider the correspondence with the Irish Free State in 1929 about the termination of commercial treaties applying to more than one Member of the British Commonwealth, - see Foreign Office letter Fo.U. 1*21/21 U/750 of the 8l|th July, 1S29, and Dominions office letter To. D.8359/29 of the 16th September, 1929. At the time we told the Irish Free State (rovernment that, if a foreign Government desired to terminate a commercial treaty in thi? category, we should be ready to confer with the Free State Government as to the best course to be adopted in the particular circumstances (with a view to ensuring that termination between the foreign country and the United Kingdom should not necessarily carry with it termination as between the foreign country and the Free State). We think that it would be reasonable to argue that that correspondence could not effect the position with regard to any such Treaty in respect of which notice of denunciation had already been given by the foreign counLry concerned. On this basis no action seems to be required in connection with the Muscat Treatyof 1891 beyond the formal action referred to in paragraph 5 above. X’his formal action will give the Governments of Canada and Eire an opportunity, if they care to take it, of calling attention to any matters which affect their interests. 7 . We will consider the point raised in paragraph 10 of your letter with regard to the possibility of action under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts arising out of the negotiation of a new Treaty with Muscat, but it may be difficult to come to even a provisional conclusion about this antil we have some clearer idea of what is likely to be included in the new Treaty with regard to our capitulate rights in Muscat. 8. I am sending copies of this letter to Gibson, Kelf-Gohen and Davies. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) G. E. BOYD SHANNONFOREIGN OFFICE, 3.?/. 1 25th March, 1938. Dear Gihson, I enclose three copies of some rather rough draft articles which I suggest in substitution of those articles in your draft which deal with capitulatory rights in Muscat. I will not try and explain them now but v/ill defer comment for the meeting. I have I am afraid also a good deal to say about the other draft articles, but as these are of interest also to other Departments, the Board of Trade in particular, I will merely raise these points at the meeting. I suggest that the capitulatory articles on the one hand and the rest of the treaty on the other could be treated at the meeting as separate subjects seeing that for the former it v/ill hardly be necessary for representatives of Departments other than the India Office and Foreign Office to attend, whereas the other articles interest other Departments as well. At present I am assuming that the meeting is at 10,30 on Wednesday at the India Office, but if perchance you said 10,15 ins of 10.30, I should be grateful if you would let me know. Yours sincerely J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office.giTOGESTED TEXT TO REPLACE ARTICLES 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 19 OF THE INDIA OFFICE DRAFT . 12. 1.

The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 shall apply to nationals of the Sultan or a third State who are in the regular service of the consul of His Majesty the King and Emperor as if they were nationals of His Majesty provided that, if any such person should be charged with a crime or a serious offence, and sufficient evidence is produced to the consul to satisfy him that the charge should be proceeded with, the consul will discharge such person from his service so as to allow the charge to be tried by the authorities of the Sultan. 17. (Article 18 of the India Office draft.)T.9559/37. Kli OF TFaFE, 'FCFCF STUFF' 25th March, 1938. Dear Gibson, I am replying to your letter (P.Z.7851/37) of the 8th December, 1937, and subsequent correspondence about the proposed revision of the treaty with Muscat. The reply to your original letter was delayed owing to the pressure of urgent work, and to my own absence on sick leave since the middle of January. However, we have now gone through the texts and have the following remarks to make. The draft Treaty at first sight seems rather a curious mixture of unilateral and bilateral provisions, but I assume that this is inevitable in the circumstances and that it is not desired to attempt to make a treaty in general reciprocal form such as we normally make with foreign countries. On particular points our observations are as follows:~ Article 1. Though this is not strictly a Board of Trade point, it would seem preferable to say (notwithstaiding bson, Esq,4 ! that the present wording is horrowed from the 1891 Treaty), 'Upon the entry intp force of the present Treaty the Treaty concluded on the 19th March, 1891, shall be abrogated'. After all. Article 1 will remain forceless until the new Treaty comes into force, and under Article 23 of the draft it will only come into force on ratification. Pending that, the declaration that the old Treaty is void itself remains of no effect. (For this very reason the present draft might possibly be allowed to stand, and no exchange of notes would be really necessary to cover the interim period; but this might lead to misunderstanding with the Sultan and therefore seems undesirable). Article 2. As rights are conferred on companies under Article 20, it would seem necessary to include a definition of 1 companies* in this Article. Also I think we must have a definition of the territories to which the Treaty applies. We already \ id Th S fi dthe 1 !85i i % ' Under t fl to force | t°n that tied • tlis ty te alloiis *ally necess^ it lead to ’ore seei n courpaiiiea o include a of the He already ^ave references to 'territories” in Article 5(2) and Article- 9, and further I think that the word “territories” ought to he substituted for “dominions” throughout the draft (Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 and 18). You will note that in Article 11, last paragraph, there is a reference, taken from the 1891 Treaty, to “Hi^ Majesty’s dominions”. .This phrase seems impossible in present-day conditions since we cannot undertake obligations e.g. for Canada, Australia or South Africa unless they want to accede to the Treaty.. I think, therefore, that Article 2 should be revised so as to read:- Vv_-_ c ' ^ o ”(l) The territories of the High Contracting Parties to which the present Treaty applies, on the part of His Majesty the King and Emperor, are Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and any territories in respect of which notice of accession is given under Article 22 or notice of extension is given under Article 21, and on the part of the Sultan Any reference in the present Treaty to the territories of the High Contracting Parties shall be deemed to relate to those territories of such High Contracting Party to which the Treaty applies. (2) ZAs the present paragraph ±7• (3) /Rs the present paragraph 2/. ( 4 ) For the purposes of this Treaty the expression ”companies of one (or of the other) High Contracting Party” means all limited liability and other companies, oartnerships or associations formed for the purpose of commerce, finance, industry, transport or any other business and duly constituted in accordance with the laws in force in the territories of that High Contracting Party.”Article 3. We observe that the corresponding Artier £ of the 1891 Treaty gave British subjects only most- f avoured-nation treatment. If you can get national treatment as well, clearly so much the better, but this would only be possible provided that the Article is kept unilateral, since I think we cannot give Muscat subjects national rights in all respects in this country* On.the other hand, we habitually stipulate in our treaties for reciprocal national and most-favoured-nation treatment in matters of taxation , both for subjects and companies. Therefore, if you would fail to get general national rights for British subjects it might be well to have a separate taxation Article giving them national and most-favoured-nation rights in matters of taxation in Muscat. .(If necessary such a provision could be made bilateral). We could suggest a text if required. ihe words in square brackets at the end of the first paragraph of Article 3 seem inappropriate where they stand, since they are really needed as a qualification of the rights of entry and residence , and we suggest, therefore, that they should be transferred to Article 5 (see note on that Article). ArticlesThe ’'freedom of commerce and navigation' Article, which is your Article 5, normally comef4-n fescat ountry, pula1; e injt; 'favoareci^i 1 Ejects g gen^ ■ght be iem nationals taxation in ould be ids equired, ad of the fin; ffhere they sfc ation of tiis sst, tbereto, 5 (see h oserce sud 5, .irst amongst the substantive Articles of our commercial - - - .V treaties: and I should therefore be inclined to transpose ^ Articles 3 and 5. Imperial Preference. The- reference in the last paragraph of Article 3 to the most favoured nation raises the question whether any Imperial preference safeguarding arrangement is required to cover the Treaty as a whole. So far as I can see this should not be necessary, since no safeguard is needed for the unilateral Articles, while the bilateral ones (Nos. 4, 5, 18 and 20) do not include any most-favoured-nation provisions with the exception of Article 4, and as Article 4 is purely concerned with consuls probably no Imperial preference reservation is necessary in regard to it. But if other bilateral most favoured-nation provisions should later be introduced, the question of safeguarding Imperial preference will need to be reconsidered. ^ For the sake of uniform phraseology, I think it would be well throughout to say !, any other foreign country ,f or ,f the most favoured foreign country’ 1 (as the context may require) in place of ’’most favoured nation”. A further point arises in regard to shipping. It is normal in Treaty practice to stipulate rights for ships aswell as for subjects in shipping matters and indeed it doubtful if rights for subjects alone wuld preclude * discrimination against British snips. iherefore, I think we must insert in some form a provision xor general national and most-favoured-nation rights for British ships. I suggest that this might be done by inserting a separate Article, corresponding to paragraph 1 of Article 13 of the new. Siamese Treaty, which might run as follows u In all that relates to navigation and the treatment of shipping the Sultan undertakes to treat British subjects and vessels not less favourably in any respect than Jiis own subjects and vessels or the subjects and vessels of any other foreign country. The provisions of this Article relating to vessels apply also to the passengers and cargoes carried therein. u Such a provision could, if necessary, be made bilateral, except that in respect of coasting trade we could only agree to give Muscat most favoured nation (and not national) treatment. A reference to this new Article, if adopted, should be included in Article 20 in order to secure rights for British shipping companies. Article 4 , line 15. For appointed to the consular officers’ 1 read apparently ”appointed to consular offices”. This Article seems rather out of place in the middle of Articles concerned with the rights of subjects, and I suggestetetof8 ll(. 0r till 8 a (s^ r Wcl e i!„, and the rtakestitK; ' vessels op 'sign coit^ • n S to vessel! pea carried be made bill! fe could onlji lot national] ile, if adopts;, to secure ril 'tV 4 to tl insular offisss 1 the middled jects, ardlsti: p. .xiat it might be transferred so as to come before Article 11, O * , &lt; w C which seems to be the first Article where particular duties and rights of Consuls are laid down. Article 5 , paragraph 1. We cannot give Muscat subjects unqualified rights to entry into the United Kingdom, and this right will need to be qualified by the words ,, so long as they satisfy and observe .... departure of all foreigners” which occur at present in square brackets at the end of the first paragraph of Article 3; . this seems to be their appropriate place. I do not know if it would be undesirable to make this provision reciprocal in effect, i,e. whether you want to retain an absolute right for British subjects to enter Muscat. If so, I think you would have to narrow the proviso down by saying, after the words ”wholesale or retail, in each other*s territories” in the eighth line of Article 5(1), something like ‘‘provided, as regards subjects of the Sultan, that they satisfy and observe the conditions and regulations applicable in the territories of H• M. the King and Emperor to the entry” etc. Paragraphs 2 and 5 . It would seem desirable, in a provision of this kind, to cover the trade of British , m subjects in Muscat as well as trade between Muscat and British territories. This might be secured by reading,e.g. -'Bach of the H.C.P. f s undertakes to inform 7 3 the other of his intention to establish in his territories any monopoly, with a view to securing that the monopoly shallinterfere as little as possible with the trade between the territories of the H.C.^s or with trade carried on in the _ territories of one H.C.P. by the subjects of the other'. Paragraph 5 , If we define companies as I have already suggested in Article 2,. .the words 'or companies, partnerships or associations' in the fifth and sixth lines of paragraph 3 can be deleted. It shauld be noted that the new Siamese Treaty (Gmd.5608) contains altered provisions as to monopolies - see^ Article 10(l) and the annexed .letters Nos.l and 2, You may wish to consider whether these new provisions are worth substituting for, or adding to, your present draft paragraphs 2 and 3. In his comments on the Sultan’s draft Article 4, the officiating Political Resident expressed the opinion that the grant of a monopoly to a foreigner in Muscat would not be - compatible with our most favoured nation rights, I am afraid that he is mistaken on this point, . , Article 7 . Your draft Article provides that British §B ^ e . c 1 ig. Muscat shall enjoy most favoured nation treatment in respect of duties on goods, but there is nothing in your^ticle 1(f) to consider for, or , the that the )t he ’itish ,reatment nyour raft to prevent the Sultan- from levying discriminatory import duties on goods of British origin . Separate provisions to deal with these two aspects of the matter seem to he needed. Moreover, there is no provision as to export duties, although Article 9(2) deals with export prohibitions. Assuming that the obligations are&lt;to be purely unilateral on Muscat, the Article might read somewhat as follows:- u , u (l) Articles produced or manufactured in the territories 01 His Majesty the King and Emperor, imported into the territories of the Sultan, from whatever place arriving, shall not be subjected to other or higher duties or .charges than those paid on the like articles produced or manufactured in any other foreign country. . (2) No other or higher duties or charges shall be imposed in the territories of the Sultan on the- exportation of any article to the territories of His Majesty the King and Emperor than such as are or may be payable on the exportation of the like article to any other foreign country. (3) No duty or charge exceeding that paid by the Sultan’s subjects or the subjects or citizens of anyother foreign country shall he levied on articles of- whatsoever origin or description (i) manifested for and imported into the territories of the Sultan, or (ii) exported from the said territories, hy British subjects, v/hether such import or export take place by sea, land or air. (4) Similarly, no duty or charge exceeding that paid hy the Sultan 1 s subjects or the subjects or citizens of any other foreign country shall be levied on any produce of the Sultanas territories that may be imported or exported by British subjects from one part to another xoart of the said territories. (5) The import duties leviable in the territories of the Sultan on goods produced or manufactured in the territories of His Majesty the King and Emperor, and on goods imported by British subjects into the said territories, shall be paid at the port /or other place/ in the Sultan’s territories where the goods are first imported, and on payment thereof such goods shall thereafter be exempt w r ithin the said territories from all other Customs duties.’ 1 Paragraph 5 of this redraft is of course based on the second sentence of Article 7, paragraph 1, of the draft.aot «ni(i tlle Ht, ies &gt; u aii! Ejects,, f slain, ^ ‘wlestbt^ “Meets ■') citories, ^ the territcrls anufactureiin M Baperor, i; 3 into the sal; ’t /or other aere the gooisi )f such goois »said territt irse of the draft. 'The corresponding Article ( 6 ) of the 1891 Treaty was in fact so worded as to prevent any further duties or taxes, no matter how designated, heing imposed in Muscat after the goods had been imported* If, however, it is nov/ proposed not to go as far as this, and to allow internal taxation on imported goods to be levied in Muscat, I think we must include an Article of the type normal in our conmercial treaties providing that such internal taxes shall not be higher on our goods than on Muscat goods or the goods of any other country* An Article might be included for this purpose on the lines of Article 9 of the new Siamese Treaty with a few desirable amendments. It would read as follows (assuming that it would be unilateral - we could make it bilateral if necessary though this should be unnecessary unless all the goods Articles are to be made bilateral) ’’Internal duties, taxes or fees levied within the territories of the Sultan for the benefit of the State or of organs of local or municipal government, on or in connection with goods produced or manufactured in the territories of His Majesty the King and I&amp;nperor, shall not be other or greater than the duties, taxes or fees levied in similar circumstances on or in connection with goods of national or any other foreign origin.” This new Article might be inserted between the present Articles 8 and 9. If you wish to retain detailed provisions regardingexemptions from payment of Customs duty and sale by publf*'* auction of goods left uncleared in the Muscat Customs, as set out in paragraphs (a) to (d) of your draft Article 7 ( 2 ) I see no objection to their retention. I notice, however that in line 2 of your Article 7(2)(b) you have acted on the suggestion of the Officiating Political Resident, that the Sultan’s words ’’not being manifested and consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan” ought to read ”manifested and not being consigned”. I think that on this point Mr. Caroe was under a misapprehension. All cargo taken on board a ship is entered on the manifest and it is not the case that the appearance of goods on the manifest at Muscat would prove that the goods were not consigned to a Muscat port. Incidentally, should not the paragraph which follows 7 (8)(d) be lettered '(e)' instead of being numbered '(g)'? v/itn reference to the proposed omission of the Sultan's draft Article 7, I enclose an extract from a minute from our Mercantile Marine Department, who do not wish you to agree that the Sultan may levy shipping dues at his own unfettered discretion until they have had an opportunity to discuss the subject with the interested companies. Can , please, what are the present arrangements in Muscat with regard to the levying of shipping dues?C0I %eH XI wm to Ij lon ‘ All ^ lan ^est 3Eilj; on the E ot consipe; ?h which folh? I nuabered 11 on of the is : a minute fi ot wish you I es at his on in opportune companies igements iiilK ? Article 8 . The changes introduced into paragraph 2 as to Customs valuation seem desirable. In the seventh line of paragraph 3, for 1 members 1 presumably read ‘numbers’. Article 9. A special provisioi\ as to opiurn etc. ? on the lines of Article 8(3) of the new Siamese Treaty, is usually included as part of, or immediately following, the prohibitions Article. I do not know whether such a provision is needed in the present unilateral Article or not, but you will wish to consider the point. We agree to 3^0 ur pro pas al to omit the Sultan* s Article 11 (Seamen Deserters) since we understand that you are satisfied that the Political Agent could in any case exercise jurisdiction over British deserters in Muscat under the Muscat Order-in-Council and our owi Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. Article 12 , paragraph 1, 12th line. Although the wording ’’disputes with subjects of His Majesty the King and Brrrperor amongst themselves” is taken from Article 13 of the 1891 Treaty, I think it ought to be amended to read ’’disputes between subjects” etc. Article 14. Hot withstanding your comments on this draft Article, I think the concluding words ’’ English bankruptcy law” are probably right. It would surely be avery difficult matter to determine precisely in many particular cases what was the place of domicile of a British subject. In many instances very likely Muscat itself would he the domicile, at any rate for practical purposes. Moreover, even if it were possible to decide exactly what was the domicile of each particular British subject, surely our consuls would be faced with an impossible task if they had in each case to apply the legislation of whatever might happen to be a particular individual^ domicile., Would not similar difficulties stand in the way of the alteration of the reference to 'Snglish law 11 at the end of Article 16 ? As regards the Sultan f s draft Article 15 . I agree with the comments of the Government of India in their despatch of the 25th February, 1938, No. F.77 - N.37; but if the Sultan wishes to make this Article reciprocal I see no objection to your offering him an Article on the lines of the enclosed extract (Article 27) from our Model Draft Treaty. _SQ . I think that this Article, based on Article 5 of the new Siamese Treaty, is probably the simplest way of dealing with companies; hut it will, of course, need to he carefully watched as the negotiationsprogress to ensure that we do not step into pit-falls consequent on alterations in other Articles. The rights and obligations conferred by treaties on subjects are not in all cases appropriate without modification to companies. Article 22 , paragraph 1 , 8 th line. For Effected 1 read ’effected’. Initial period of validity o f the n ew Treaty (Articles 21 1 22 and 24). We notice that you propose 12 years, as in the 1891 Treaty. This is a much longer r . - . . period than we should be likely to provide for nowadays in our bilateral commercial treaties, but no doubt the case is altered by the i*act that the present Treaty is to be mainly unilateral and presumably you want to tie the Sultan up for as long as possible. If, in the course of negotiations, you have to make the Treaty more bilateral and reciprocal in form, the point may perhaps deserve further consideration. There remain two points, as to which you will wish to consider whether they should be dealt with by new Articles, viz. (l) uncondition a l most-favoured-nation treatment and ( 2 ) arbitration. As to (l), there are a number of most-favoured-nation provisions scattered about the Treaty and it seems important that the Sultan should be left no loophole for treating anyof them as conditional* I should he inclined, therefore'*'’ to insert a new Article of general scope, reading somewhat as follows:- U A11 the provisions of the present Treaty providing for the grant of the treatment accorded to the most ^ favoured foreign country shall he interpreted as meaning that such treatment shall he accorded immediately and unconditionally, without request or compensation. ,f This follows the lines of paragraph 4 of the Protocol to the new Siamese Treaty and we are thinking of including such a stipulation regularly in our future treaties. The Article might he inserted after all the substantive Articles and before the formal Articles, i.e, between the present Articles 20 and 21. As to (2), I do not know whether you will think it desirable or not in the special circumstances of Muscat to have a provision for settlement of disputes arising out of the treaty by arbitration. If you do, you will find our up-to-date form of Article for the purpose in Article 21 of the new Siamese Treaty. I am sending copies of this letter to Baggallay, Beckett, Boyd-Shannon and Davies. Yours sincerely.1.

X. Steam Navigation Co. - to and from India (Bombay) Strick Line n _ ) - to United Kingdom, etc. Ellerman &amp; Bucknall ) Hansa Yamashita In 1936/7 the number and tonnage of steamers entering and clearing Muskat and Madras were - British Hansa Japanese 117 10 8 135 362,439 tons 83,132 “ 50.540 ' 495,911 ” Probably the bulk of the 'British' ships were B. I.S.N. ships, including, or perhaps consisting of, the weekly mail steamer, as the ships would be in some relation to the current of trade. In addition to the steamer traffic there is a considerable import and export trade in sailing vessels (40 per cent, of total imports, 20 per cent, of total exports), which is mainly with India. As I understand the position there are no shipping dues proper in Muskat, since under the French Treaty the 5 per cent, import duty exempts vessels from 'anchorage, pilotage and any other charges,' including charges on cargo left on board; and the U.S. Treaty makes the 5 per cent, include ail 'import and export duties, tonnage, licence to trade, pilotage, anchorage, or any other charge whatever 'and also precludes charges on cargo on board. Presumably this exertion is claimed by British subjects (and is in practice enjoyed by British ships) under Article 2 of 1891. Provision was made under Article 8 , 1891, for shipping, tonnage or harbour dues, and the Sultan wants to have the right of levying such dues himself instead of by agreement between himself and the Treaty Powers, and India ( 4. cproposes that every effort should he made to secure the withdrawal of the Sultan’s Article 7 so as to permit the continuance of the existing arrangements. Not knowing what existing arrangements are, I cannot decide what line must he taken, and before we could say I think it would he necessary to consult the shipping organisations (confidentially if necessary) to see if national and most-favoured-nation provisions would he satisfactory. With existing British preponderance it seems that national and most-favoured-nation would not he much safeguard without some clear understanding as to what charges would he permitted. This question is of the same general type as the question of fiscal autonomy which, according to the notes on Article 6, is being dealt with separately.''tBEE (+£7) E XTRACT FROM MODEL DRAPT TREATY ARTICLE 27.

The text will be found at page 310 of Aitchison s Treaties, volume 11, 5th (1929) edition, and on page 442 of the Handbook of Commercial Treaties. 3. Article 21 of this Treaty states that its stipulations shall be applicable to all the colonies n foreign /■d Shannon, Esq ninions Office.foreign possessions of He^ Britannic Majesty, excepting those ‘‘hereinafter named', provided, however, that these stipulations may Become applicable to the 'named' colonies or foreign possessions on due notice being given by Her Britannic Majesty’s representative in Muscat within two years of the date of the exchange of ratifications. The 'named' colonies or foreign possessions were:- The Dominion of Canada, Newfoundland, the Cape of Cood Hope, Natal, New South males, Victoria, Queensland,Tasmania, South Australia, Vestern Australia, New Zealand. 4. Notices under Article 21 were in fact subsequently given as regards self-governing Dominions in the cusjs of Canada, Australia, the Union of South Africa and Ireland, but the Commonwealth of Australia withdrew from participation in the Treaty on 3rd December, 1923, as is recorded in an agreement made on 11th February, 1929 for the prolongation of the Treaty for one year (see page 319 of the above-mentioned volume e»f Aitchis^n) and the Union ^f South Africa withdrewI *h STth October, 1932 (see Treaty Series No.41, 1933). 5. The agreement of 1929 which has apparently sin£e been extended year by year also states:~ ”It is also understood that it shall 'be Jpen to the Dominion of Canada and 'the Irish Dree State to withdraw from 'the aforesaid Treaty at any time on 'notice being given to that effect by 'His Majesty’s representative at fuscat'. But there dbes not seem to be any record of either Canada or Ireland having in fact withdrawn, so that the position is that, in addition to the United Kingdom, Newfoundland, Southern Rhodesia and the Colonies and Mandated Territories, the Treaty of 1891 applies today to the Dominisn of Canada, Ireland, India and Burma. 6. The Sultan informed the political \gent at Muscat on 1 st April IDS'? that he desired to discuss the revision of tile treaty, but he does not seem to have ever given notice, under Article 23 of the Treaty, of a definite intentian t©te terminate it at the end of twelve months and his &lt;*oxnmuni/^ation wae. apparently tantamount to an intimation that he did not desire to renew the agreement of 1929 for a further period when it otherwise came to an end on the following 11th rehruary, i.e. 11th February 9 1958. But he subsequently agreed, on 29th November, 1957, to extend its validity for a further year so as to give more time for the negotiation •f a treaty to take its place. ’’he existing rn reaty will therefore come to an end, failing any further i prolongation, on 11th Pebruary, 1959. The Treaty of 1891 is a capitulations and a commercial treaty but unlike the Morocco capitulatory and commercial treaties was terminable and is coming to an end in accordance with its own provisions ^he question &amp;f Dominions consent to its abrogation does not arise therefore. 7. The main question which now arises is on whose behalf the new Treaty is to be signed and the way in which the various Dominions shall be associated with it, if at all. In addition it will, I presume, -be necessary to inform the Dominion Governments of the Sultan's termination »f the Treaty.Treaty. 8. The new Treaty will be a Heads of State agreorient, and the natural course would be for it to be. concluded by TVie King for Great Britain, Northern Ireland and India, with an extension clause for the colonies and overseas territories etc. (to cover Newfoundland, Southern Rhodesia and Burma) and to have an accession clause for the Dominions. (I may say that, in view of the close relations of India with Huscat, it is certain that it will in any case be signed on behalf of the United Kingdom and of India).. There is no neea for any procedure of Dominions notes as well as an accession clause as in the case of Uorocco because the raison d’etre »f the Horocco notes was Dominions consent to the termination of the treaty which is as explained above n&gt;.-‘t required here. 9. The present treaty deals with a variety of subjects, including not only restrictions on the Muscat tariff but also extraterritorial rights to the queen and her We do not yet know precisely what the new the substance of which the India office are much mo re the grant of successors. treaty (withmore closely concerned than the Foreign Office) is likely to contain, 'bud while we hope that it will he possible to maintain our extraterritorial rights, even if in a modified form, it is probable that the tariff restrictions will largely disappear (although they will still continue, under the most-favoured-nation clause which we shall no doubt try to include in the new treaty, until such time as ruseat can rid herself of corresponding obligations to the United States and France). 10. Incidentally we should explain that as regards the exercise of capitulatory rights we shall have to consider whether iliscat is to be classed with Fgypt, Morocco and China ©r with the other Persian Oulf States. If you look at the correspondence with regard to the exercise by His Majesty's Government of jurisdiction over all British subjects and the necessity of Dominions consent therefou? (see in particular, page 4 of the draft letter to United kingdom High Commissioner enclosed in your official letter of 14th July last), you will see that while admitting theu.uumni—iii ■ ijuimmu— f^6 n-ecea^ity fox such consent in the first c se we did not adait i in the second - on the ground th-ut the othe A Persian Gulf states we* e.

Dear Gihson, Thank you for your letter No. P.Z.515/38 of the 7th March about the proposed revision of the Commercial ircaty with Muscat of 1891. We note that the views of the Government of India on the Sultan’s proposals have not yet been received, and I understand that the Board of Trade and foreign Office have also not yet formulated their ooservations. In these circumstances the following comments should be regarded as merely preliminary. 7, As stated in our official letter of the 27th July, 1937, the Treaty applies to Canada, Eire, Newfoundland, Southern Rhodesia and Basutoland, It would not be in accordance with present constitutional practice for His Majesty, in negotiating a treaty in respect of the United Kingdom and/or India, to affect detrimentally the rights of any of the Dominions without their express consent. It seems essential, therefore, that the consent of Canada and Eire should be obtained to any modification of the 1891 Treaty, The Government of Eire, at GIBSON, ESQ.at any rate, is unlikely to wish to participate 'by signature in a new treaty negotiated hy the United Kingdom with Muscat, so that the form in which Canada and iire should consent to any revision will need con sideration. Separate notes addressed on behalf of each 01 them to the Sultan might be appropriate, but it does not seem practicable to consider further what procedure would be best until the extent of the proposed revision is more exactly known. 3. In accordance with the recommendation of the Drafting Committee on the form of Commercial Treaties of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the 1930 Imperial Conference (E.(30; 34 (CT)), a new commercial treaty negotiated now should stipulate in terms for benefits for all British subjects and ships by the inclusion of specific definitions of these expressions. It is also the normal practice now to insert an Imperial Preference safeguarding clause, if the Treaty includes provision for most-favoured-nation treatment in His Majesty* s territories. Even if the wording of the old treaty is retained in the new one, there are several places where it might, be modernized, but it seems premature———premature to deal with this until the suhstanoe has ■been settled. 4. There is not likely to he any difficulty over tne revision of the 1891 Treaty in respect of Newfoundland, Southern Rhodesia and Basutoland, hut, so far as the Dominions Office is concerned, we would suggest that, subject to the views of other Departments, ii the new treaty is to apply ah i nitio to colonies etc., provision might be included for their separate withdrawal o. .then the views of the Government of India are received, perhaps the best way of settling the views of the United Kingdom Government would he to have a small interdepartmental meeting? 6 .

We agree generally with Sir Trenchard Fowle f s vie on Articles 4 to 8 and 20 of the drait treaty subject to the following coments: Article 4 . As regards paragraph 2, it is desirable that 'most favoured nation r treatment should be provided for in respect of import and export prohibitions ana restrictions. In this connection attention is invited to the remarks against Article 12 in our express letter referred to above, c.f. Article 2 of the Treaty between Muscat and United States of America, and Article 11 of the Treaty between Itocat and France. Article 6 . (a). The Article provides only for ’most favoured nation* treatment of goods imported by British subjects. It is considered that provision should also, be made for the , most favoured nation* treatment of goods of the contracting parties. (Signature) (Designation) -441S&amp;P—((sr-712) —« 28*9-29—5,000.(o^O^ (b) The draft of paragraph 3 of the exemptions seems to cover all Naval and Royal Air Force requirements, but it is suggested that in the case of the latter, Air Neadquaiters, British Forces in Iraq, should be consulted* (c) With reference to the last paragraph, it is considered that British subjects should be exempted from payment of customs weighing charges; if this is not possible it is suggested that a provision should be inserted that such charges will be on a low scale and that their incidence will not be raised. In this connection, attention is invited to paragraph 2 of letter to Bushire No.F.432 -N/37 ? dated vi-'v S/yv do the 18th September 1937, copies of which were forwarded in our weekly letter No.82-M, dated the 23rd September 1937* It is also considered that there should be some safeguard in respect of the other miscellaneous charges dealt with in the last paragraph of the article, e.g. that they will not exceed the actual cost of the services they are. intended to cover. .Article 2 0. We agree that this Article requires revision and suggest that it might be re-drafted on modern lines, c.f. articles 34 and 35 of the Anglo-Roumanian Commercial Treaty of 1930. It appears from the draft as it stands that India is included among f foreign possessions*. As the proposed treaty will presumably be concluded by His Majesty’s Government jointly on behalf of the United Kingdom and India there will be no necessity to include India among the parts of the j&amp;ipire in the accession clause.

We will communicate our final Views when we have received a reply from the Sind Government11» we support Fov/le's recommendations that this article should be deleted provided suitable arrangements can be made with the Sultan apart from the Treaty ior the recovery of deserters from British ships of war and their handing over to the Naval authorities. Desertion from British merchant vessels is an offence under section 221 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and in the case of vessels registered in British India under section 100 of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act of 1923. Both these Acts are applicable to Muscat, and the Political Agent can deal with offences under them under Article 12. No special provision in the Treaty is therefore necessary. article 12. We should not, it is considered, agree to the British subjects receiving worse treatment than that accorded under treaty to subjects of othe so long as the treaties concerned remain in fo their present form. In this connection attention is invited to Article 6 of the Treaty between Muscat and United States of America, and Articles 3 and 6 of the Treaty between Muscat and France. This consideration also applies in the case of Articles 15 and 17. (3 AnUsi sift ./Article 15 . The draft of paragraph 2 as it stands clearly runs counter to the existing law in British India. In the first place section 57 of the administrator G-eneral's Act, 1913 (assuming that the section is rendered operative Vis-a-vis subjects of the Sultan of I'uscat) will have no application when a Muscat subject dies outside British India leaving property in British India, nor when there is a person other than the Administrator General entitled to apply for letters of administration. Secondly, the draft article if given effect to would mean that even in respect of immoveabl e property of the deceased the disposition will be gove nbd by the Muscat Law. This is diametrically opposed to the law as administered in British India and equally to Anglish Law. It will be seen from Section 5 of the Indian Succession Act, | 1925, that the British Indian law takes no notice of the : nationality of the deceased in the matter of succession, 1 the determining tk factor being the domicile of the deceased, ; and even if it is assumed that most of the Sultan T s subjects : will be domiciled in Muscat, still in respect of the immo veable | property left by any such in British India, the property ■twill have to be disposed of in accordance with the British | Indian law and not in accordance with Muscat la?/. As for moveable property it can be disposed of by the proposed Muscat Consul, if letters of administration are granted to him by a competent British Indian Court, in accordance with the Muscat law provided the subject of Muscat aoncemed was domiciled in Muscat at the time of his death. Under the first paragraph of this draft article British subjects acquire a right similar to what the second paragraph seeks uo acquire for Muscat subjects and if the principle of strict reciprocity is accepted no exception could be taken uo tne second paia- graph of this article. But the all important lact remains that if the article as drafted is accepted, legislation will have to be undertaken in order to confer special rights on Muscat subjects residing, or possessing property in British India, a right which - - - _ _ - — _ ^Attention is also invited to our comments on Article 12 c*f« Article 9 of the Treaty between Muscat and the United States of .America* Article 17• Please see remarks on Article 12*has nou so far been conferred uoon sifm'pnf ■ ,, ueun suojacts oi any other State.

I attach a note. I taice it that it will be desired as far as possible to accept the Sultan’s draft, and that it may therefore be thought inadvisable to pursue certain suggestions made. A copy of the Siamese Treaty referred to several times in the note is also attached. I suggest that copies of the Sultan's draft, etc. should go as soon as possible to the Dominions and Colonial Offices, and that the views of the Oovernment of India should be expedited. When these and those; of the Board of Trade are received, a redraft will, I thi be necessary. It might be useful if someone with knowledge’of Muscat or of the Gulf were available.Preamble . There is a short form for this, and the only question arising is, whether the Treaty should he in the name of 'His Majesty, etc. for Great Britain and Northern Ireland' or 'His Majesty, etc. for India'. Since India has much larger commercial interests in Muscat than any other part of the Empire, I see no reason why the Treaty should not be in the latter form. I am not, however, aware that any Dominion Treaty has, as yet, included the usual accession clauses, and as these must presumably be in the Muscat Treaty, it may be considered preferable to have it in the name of 'His Majesty^ for the-Uttitod Kingdom and Northern Ireland'. Article 2(l) . Subjects should, I think, include all British subjects and all British protected persons - vide Article 1(1) of the Protocol to the Siamese Treaty. I agree that 'which shall not be harmful to the Sultanate”, should go out. I think it might be sufficient to get for British subjects national and most-favoured nation treatment, which should satisfy the Sultan as they would then be subject to any laws (consistent with the other provisions of the Treaty) which he might think fit to make for his own subjects. National treatment is indeed better than is generally obtainable nowadays - vide Article 1(b) of the Siamese Treaty. Article 3(B) . National treatment might be tried for here also. Article 3. It is quite ordinary to require that Consuls ' &gt;' - v should be 'appointed and recognised by the Article 18 of the Siamese Treaty**'. Who is to decide 'wherever the interests of commerce may require'? As you know, the general practice of the Government of India is to have Consuls only at sea-ports. Article 4(1) . Would it he an improvement, and sufficient, to substitute for 'except that special permission by thelocal authorities” ’’subject to such conditions as are or may he established for reasons of national security, or other reasons of public policy”, vide Article l(2)(a)(i) of the Siamese Treaty. Article 4(2) . If I am correct in suggesting that it is only Article 7 of the existing Treaty which deprives the Sultan of these rights, he should have no objection to the omission of the paragraph. Article 4(3) . I question whether the position would be safeguarded simply by the omission of this paragraph. Would something modelled on the lines of the following, taken from the Siamese Treaty of 1925 be adequate:- ’’Each of the contracting parties undertakes to inform the other of its intention to establish any monopoly with a view to securing that the monopoly shall interfere as little as possible with the trade between the territories of the two contracting parties. In the event of the establishment of any such monopoly, the question of the payment of compensation and the amount, if any, of such compensation which shall be paid to the subjects or companies, partnerships or associations of one of the two contracting parties established in the territories of the other shall be settled by mutual agreement by the two contracting parties or by arbitration”. Article 5 . A possible alternative to the^suggestion would be to provide for national treatment vide Article 1(2)(b) Article 6 . It hardly seems worth while commenting on this important Article until the Government of India's views are received. The possibility of getting the Sultan to conventionalise the duties on the chief imports from the Empire might be borne in mind. Q&amp;dk Article 7 . I doubt if it is possible, as suggested by the Resident in his Note on Article 4, to specify Articles which may be prohibited. For example, he has not included seditious or obscene literature, or disease-bearing plants or animals. Normally, national and most-favoured nation treatmentis regarded as sufficient, vide Article 8(2) of the Siamese Treaty. Article 7 . If the Sultan r s draft should be accepted it would seem well to arrange for national and most favoured nation treatment. Article 8 . I have no strong views tariff values are to be fixed by the market prices, which is I think theoretically correct, a purist might hold that they should be the market prices of similar goods less customs duty paid on them. National and most-favoured nation treatment might again be provided for. Article 10 . There might be a provision that salvaged goods should be exempt from payment of customs duty, unless cleared for internal consumption. Article 11 . I do not think that provisions of this nature are usual in modern Treaties. Article 13 . Is 'English Bankruptcy Law' quite satisfactory, or should it be the ''Bankruptcy Law of the place of domiciled Article 15(1) . Again, is 'English Law' suitable here? Article 15(2) . I am pretty certain that this cannot be accepted. To take an extreme case, I think British local law would generally give to the Crown the state of a person dying without kin, c.f. Article 19 of the Siamese Treaty. Article 20 . Articles 23 and 24 of the Siamese Treaty give the present standard provisions. Article 21 . I see no reason why the Treaty should not come into operation immediately on ratification, as indeed is provided for in Article 1.Ge^erjijL. The recent Siamese Treaty contains certain provisions which do not find place in the Sultan’s draft, I do not suggest that all of these should be included in the new Treaty, but consideration at least, might be given to the following:- j Article 5 , pro^j^sions in regard to Companies, r x Article 13 . Wri-e^c trade-marks, etc. Article 21 . settlement of disputes. Article SS^ ^nevertheless” clause. think an effort should certainly be made to get this clause into the new Treaty. His Majesty’s Government have indeed undertaken to try to get it included in all Treaties which they execute. Jf« dinUrfyu ^ ^ &amp;U' ti. ^ UmiL iu&lt; cxJ '.

(2) Prolongation of 1891 Treaty . As regards the prolongation of the existing Treaty for one year pending the linal negotiations and ratification of the new Treaty, Secretary explained to His Highness the impossibility of being able to conclude the new Treaty before February next year when the present one expires and the undesirability of having a period in which there would be no Treaty between the two countries. His Highness agreed, but asked for some concessions in the terms of the present Treaty. Secretary pointed out that His Majesty's Government had now agreed to the imposition on British subjects of the new Muscat Municipal Tax and previously ( in 1934) had permitted the Sultan to raise his Custom Tariffs, though he had bound himself by the Treaty not to do so. His Majesty's Government had also used their good offices on behalf of the Sultan with the French Republic and with some difficulty persuaded them to modify their rights under their own Treaty in this connection. The Sultan promised that he would agree to prolong the existing Treaty of 1891 for another year or until such time as the new Treaty should have been concluded and ratified whichever was less. It was decided that the Political Agent, Muscat, should address a letter to the Sultan informing him of / the agreement of His Majesty’s Government to this Municipal Tax and the Sultan would then reply that he was willing to prolong the Treaty ^or one year more on the conditions stated above.Extract from Note of t diECUggion hfeld on 17.11.37. tetween Sir Aubrey U eioalie'^alcreifery, External Affairs Department, and His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, at which the Political Agent, Muscat, was also present. (!) The new Treaty . Secretary explained to the oultan that though the G-overnment of India were interested in the Treaty in view of the proximity of the two countries, it was really a matter concerning His Majesty*s Government, since this and other Treaties had been in the past concluded between Great Britain and the Sultans of Muscat. He wished therefore the Sultan clearly to understand that though the Government of India would sympathetically consider the various proposals put forward by the Sultan in the Draft Treaty and would give their opinion on them to His Majesty*s Government, they could not of course say whether they would be finally acceptable or not. The Sultan said he quite understood the situation. 11-3ft—10.000.—T i' 3 ' ^ • Jl. » A n r i i * I Extract from Note of an interview beiweei: h£sC&gt; t Excellency the Viceroy, and His HighnesITt YDS 'Snilrdi of Muscat, at which Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary, External Affairs Department, was also present. v 2. fhe Sultan next referred to the Treaty negotiations which are at present going on between Major Watts and His Highness with a view to the conclusion of a new Treaty, when the present Treaty of 1891 expires in February 1938. The Sultan wishes to get rid of a number of restrictions on his sovereignty which exist in the old Treaty and particularly to secure complete freedom of action in the matter of the imposition of import tariffs. I have already submitted a note through P.S.V. which explains the present position and I will at my next interview show His Excellency a comparative statement, which has been prepared by the Political Agent, showing the Sultan’s desiderata. His Majesty’s Government are anxious, if possible, to persuade the Sultan to agree to a prolongation of the existing Treaty for one year in order to give time for the many details of modification to be settled. If such prolongation is not arranged, we shall have no Treaty at all with the Sultan for some months while he is away on his tour of the world, and it is hoped that he will consent to be reasonable in the matter, I propose however as was indicated at today’s interview to discuss the matter with the Sultan in greater detail next week.

I do not think that Gwadur, as suggested by lir.Oaroe, can be regarded as a Dependency since it is an integral part of the Sultan’s territories. Since Hr. Caroe’s remarks were written Sultan has prolonged the Treaty. Article 2 » Paragraph 1. Mr* Garoe’s remarks. The present position is that in Muscat subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf in practice come under the jurisdiction of Article 1 the /HRHHHUHBHI m iiiiiiinnim——gnnjnju jMniMiiim i (£”’■ ■ lO -3- the Political Agent, vide ny letter -o# 116-3, dated the 13th February 1936, and connected corres- pondence« On the whole I think it would be desirable for this class of individual to remain under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent* This can be done in two ways, either (a) by making no alteration in the draft text and trusting that the Sultan will make no objection to the present practice continuing, or (b) by suggesting the necessary alteration* If we suggest (b) it will bring the matter to the Sultan’s notice and he will probably object, I am therefore in favour of (a)* at If,^any time, the Sultan wishes to take his stand on the actual text of this Article then this class will fall under Ms j uriadict ion, and 1 do not think that this matters much. At Kuwait, e,g, this class as being Moslem, comes under the Shaikh’s jurisdiction, Immediately and unconditionally , No objection to omission. Thich shall not be Armful to the Sultanate etc. Pararaph 2, This is a very sweeping exception which should be strongly resisted. It seems to me to undermine very largely the privileges accorded by this Article, If it is retained it seems t o me that there is nothing to prevent the Sultan stating that any privilege is harmful to the State and must therefore cease. No comments. Art icle / iiin imumimiii nim -4- Article So 1 agree with Mr. Caroe'a views that it may be inconvenient to postings of Political Agents to Muscat subject to the usual foniialit ies but since the Sultan is an independent sovereign end our representative at Muscat is already a Consul as well as a Political Agent I do not think that we can obj ect. iyffiApie Paragraph 1# Accept tnat special permission shall nave to be obtained etc. It is of course quite natural for tne Sultan to wish to prevent British subjects from entering the hinterland, over which he has no control, nor do we want our subjects to go into these areas. As worded, however, this proviso will give the Sultan power to prevent British subjects i r om going any wher e what soever, including ports, and it is in ports that British Indian traders carry on their activities. I think this proviso should be altered so as to cover trie hinterland only. Omission of all kinds . I do not think we need object to this omission in this part of the Article but see my remarks against paragraph 5. Paragraph 2. This is too sweeping and gives the Sultan too much latitude. The articles in question should be specified and thi can /?G •5* Paragraph 3« can easily be done, as far as I can see they could be included under three headings (a) drugs, (b) alcohol and (c) Arms and Aimiunit 1 on 0 I agree with Mr.Caroe timt this paragraph is extremely dangerous. The unrestricted use of it by the Sultan might lead to cessation of all trade in the hands of British Indian subjects in any particular commodity. For instance, rice is largely imported through British Indian traders. A monopoly of this commodity to a Muscat! subject would t a ice the rice trade completely out of British Indian hands. ue should make every effort to have this paragraph dropped or, at all event 3 , the powers contained in it considerably restricted, I agree with Hr. Caroe* s views. Artxcle 6. -Paragraph 1, Or on the produce o f the Sultan's This wo ild seem an unusual proviso in an Article dealing with Custom® duty as it refers to goods produced in one part of tne Sultan's territory and transpor ted to another part, ary duty on which should come under the heading of Octroi, no ~ Customs, «’e need not, however, raise any objection a© this provides a safeguard that British subjects shall not pay any Octroi higher than that paid by the Sultan 1 s subjects or by those of the most favoured nation. This / Article 5.- 6 - iku 4v 8 duty siiall be paid at the port in tiig Jultan 1 &amp; doainxona etc . This sentence refers (a) to goods m d merchandise imported from foreign countries as vveil as (b) to the produce of the Sultan*s dominions. At the end of this paragraph it is stated that doth classes shall he exempt from all such Customs duties, the word Oustoms being used to cover tax on both (a) e.nd (to). But though the correct term for the tax on (a) is Customs, that for the tax on (b) f since the produce is of the Sultan*s territory itself, should toe Octroi . In Article 6 of Paragraph Paragraph Paragraph the existing Treaty this confusion does not exist md the draft Article might toe reworded so as to draw a distinction between Customs and Octroi, Ho comments, I agree with Mr, C&amp;roe* s comment, Ho comments. Ho comments. Ho objection, Ho obj ecti on v/edghing charges, vide Government of India letter Ko.F.452-H/S7, dated the 18th September 1937, a re not recovered in India. If weighing charges are not customary /A Article 6* - 8 ~ I agree with the Political Agent’s remarks that this Article should have formed part of Article 6 but as the Sultan wishes it to be separate we can agree* Paragraph 1* .As far as I know it is general custom in these days to pay in cash and this can be agreed to* Paragraph 2* There must of course be some method of assessing value but personally I am not clear what 'ready money market price' exactly means* Is it, for instaroe, the retail or the wholesale price ? The last fcart of this paragraph beginning 'and in that of native goods etc. 41 really relates to an Octroi, and not a Customs, duty (see remarks against Article 6 paragraph 1). If as suggested by Major Matts and Mr*Caroe the expression 'ready money market price' disappears from this Article then there is no check on the Paragraph 3, Tariff Board in assessing prices. Some check there should be though perhaps something less dubious than 'ready money market price' should if possible be devised* Paragraph 4* At first sight it might appear that the reference to the two experti infringes /•9- infringea on the powers of the Tariff Board. The two experts, however, would, I suppose, determine the dutiable value of any particular consignment under the prescribed tariff which has been fixed by the Tariff Board. as this paragraph forms a check on arbitrary assessment by the Cub toms authorities it should from our point of view be retai ned. Article 9 . Mo comments. Article 10. Mo objection to the slight alterations in this Article. Article 11 . In this Article two different classes of persons are dealt with, deserters from (a) His majesty’s Ships (b) merchant vessels. With regard to (a) such individuals will always be British subjects, but the offence is one punishable under the Naval Discipline Act, which has not been made applicable to Muscat by the Muscat Order in Council. Such deserters therefore do not appear to coxae under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. Similarly, persons under (b) do not priiaa facie commit a criminal offence in deserting, which is merely a breach of contract, and therefore also do not fall under the criminal jurisdiction of the Political Agent. I suggest accordingly that the whole of this Article be deleted from the new Treaty, especially as the sultan’s claim for reciprocal rights cannot, as Mr. Car oe points out, be accorded* Article 12/-In so far as this Article will, as Mr.Oaroe points out, render British subjects liable to taxation, the danger is that, the Sultan being a completely autocratic Buler, actual discrimination might well be made against British subjects under coTer of a law which purports to be fair to all affected. What one has to remember in regard to this Article^ and others giving increased power to the Sultan to deal with British subj ects^ is that it may well be his general future policy to try and force Brit ish subjects to leave his territory by transferring the benefits fef trade from their hands to those of Ms own subjects. This, from his point of view, is quite understandable but, from our point of view, should of course be guarded against as much as possible, v/e have had an unfortunate experience in Persia in the direction of British Indian traders having to leave the country partly owing to the restrictions placed on their activities by the Persian Oovernment. With regard to the example given by Mr.Caroe of imposition by the Sultan of an Income tax, this or any other tax imposed /11 . imposed by the Sultan would have to be enforced through the -Political Agent* s Court,, This of course is some safeguard against dis crimination, as if disoriiain&amp;tion were proved the Court could refuse to enforce the tax. With regard to cases of dispute between British subjects and members of other Christian nations, I agree with Mr* Caroe that in preserf; circumstances such cases will be few. If, however, a flourishing Oil Company, by reason of the Petrol aim Concessions limited Oil concession, springs up in Muscat, as it has in Bahrain, then such cases may increase, but to no great extent as Petroleum Concessions x-— limited employees will be mainly British subjects. The Corapany itself^ being a British Corporation, claims of British aga inst employees^/it will be decided in the Political Agent’s Court, an important point. If, however, the Sultan grants a concession to a foreign Company e.g# for oil in Gwadur, which is not covered by the Petroleum Concessions limited concession, or for any other activity other t ian oil in any part of his dominions, both the Comp&amp;ny and its foreign employees would not in any way be under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. This, however, is the situation even under the existing Treaty. Paragraph 2./Stl -12- Paragraph 2e I agree with Mr* Oaroe* a Tiews* Ve have all the more ground for insisting that the existing safeguard should continue as it does not affect the final decision of tne Sultana Court f but merely ensures that before this final decision is given the Consul or his representa tive should have been given an oppor tunity of attending the trial* Paragraph 3* In practice this paragraph introduces nothing new* Sven under present conditions 1 since the Political Agent haa no police at his disposal for the arrest of Individuals under hie juris diction or to prevent a threatened ends must be left to the Muscat Govern ment. I am of opinion, therefore, that this paragraph should not be objected to. views and I think that if the employees in question are limited to those of the that Consulate^/the Sultan may agree. breach of the peace, action to these I agree generally with Mr.Caroe* s Article 15 .
