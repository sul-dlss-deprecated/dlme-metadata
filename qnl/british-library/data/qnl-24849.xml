The Staff List shows the South Asian Department responsible for 'the Persian Gulf' but not for Persia. On the other hantD* Persia (and Iraq) have been included in the new list of work for the South Asian Department which has recently been drawn up but left for further consideration when the new Assistant Secretaries are installed in the Par Past and western Departments (see Pol.Pxt. 1 ^ 65 ). 3. I do not suggest that we do any transferring of files at the moment but I thought that you should see this as an example of one of several 'border line' subjects between our two Departments and I should be grateful if you would keep closely in touch with us about any developments in Persian affairs handled by your Department in the next few weeks. “Apr -OrC aS \j | si DO!. + (t Ur, ^ ^ ^ ^ 0 « U.

Soviet Government claim that these two men are simple people recruited from some distant region in Soviet Union who got lost and entered Persia by mistake or alternatively did not realise the importance of their action. Persian Government are awaiting confirmation of Soviet Government's position from Soviet Embassy here. Meanwhile M. Hakmat himself seems prepared to accept one or other of these not very convincing explanations. At least he is causing careful enquiry to be made by Military Authorities in the hope of ascertaining true facts of the case. He would clearly be happy to hand back the two Soviet soldiers if he could find a good enough excuse 2 * 4 for doing so since Persian Government are being besieged by relatives of Persians held in Soviet Union imploring them to do whatever may be necessary to get the men back.

New York, Minister for Foreign Affairs summoned me today and spoke about Persian-Soviet relations. 2. Speaking on his own behalf and not on behalf of the Persian Government he said he would be glad of our confidential advice as to whether Persian Government should communicate to Security Council a titre d*information introductory report on recent incidents on Soviet-Persian frontier. Persian Government had received no reply from Soviet Government to its notes on the subject and there were two schools of thought inside the Government, one in favour of sending a communication to Security Council (presumably in the hope of putting pressure on Soviet Government to hand back kidnapped Persian nationals) and the other opposing such action. It seemed fairly clear that Mr. Hikmat himself belonged to the second category judging from his remarks about wisdom of advice received on a previous occasion from His Majesty's Government in United Kingdom (but it is contrary to advice of United States Government) to the effect that Persian Government should refrain from raising subject of Soviet-Persian relations in United Nations. As he had asked for my own view in the light of my experience of United Nations I said that personally I could not see what useful or practical result such a communication to Security Council would have at this time but that I would of course ask for your instructions, 3. Mr. Hikmat went on to say that as a^result of a suggestion which he had made to Soviet Charge d'Affaires and also through Persian Ambassador in Moscow Soviet Government had recently offered to sell 100,000 tons of wheat to Persians. They had originally asked for payment in dollars but as Persian Government had intimated this would be impossible they now seemed willing to accept sterling. Actual sale would not be to Persian Government but to a Persian merchant who was already in touch with the Persian /Government onCONFIDENTIAL Tehran telegram No. 682 to Foreign Office - 2 - Government on the subject. Minister for Foreign Affairs said he felt bound to consider effects which any Persian action in United Nations as regards frontier incidents might have on the successful outcome of this negotiation as regards wheat was of great importance to this country.

His Majesty said that the recent visit of the Regent of Iraq aad resulted in an agreement on all outstanding issues including the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, the method of final frontier delimitation and Kurdistan. The Turks had also participated in regard to Kurdistan where the situation was now noimal. 3. The Shah said that he hoped the forthcoming visit of King Abdullah of Jordan would he equally satisfactory. He was however, somewhat apprehensive about the activities of the new President of Syria. As the Minister_ for Foreign Affairs had done a few days before His Majesty plied me with questions on this subject which I evaded.

There is little doubt that during or after King Abdullah's visit His Majesty may return to the charge and ; I.should therefore welcome guidance as to the line I am to adopt if.he does so. K. As regards Pakistan-Afghanistan relations it was clear that His Majesty had little sympathy v/ith Afghan pretensions and that his sympathies are all with Pakistan. 5. Since my audience it has been 'announced that the Israeli Government have at last agreed to recognise the title of certain Persian nationals to their property in Palestine. I understand also that on at least two occasions recently, a chartered United States aircraft has taken pas sengers from Tehran to Lydda via Damascus (Iran D.G.C.A. affirm that these aircraft did not fly over Iraqi territory). This would suggest a tendency towards more normal relations between Israel and Persia. : 15N7S Foreign Office please, pass Saving to B.M.E.O.

(Cairo), U.K. Delegation New York, Angora and Bagdad. My telegram No. 351. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me this morning about the latest phase of Persian-Soviet relations. Since M. Sadtchikov 1 s departure on April 15th, there has been no improvement; rather the reverse. After a brief interval, Russian transmission from Baku has resumed its barrage of abuse and misrepresentation. An offer to resume trade negotiations (see my telegram No. 3L6) has been withdrawn a day or so after it was made. The decision, to withdraw Soviet Consulates has neither been cancelled nor carried out. These officers who have no exequaturs and therefore no regular status have in some cases announced their departure but remain at their posts. 2. M. Hikmat said that he had seen the Soviet Charg(5 d ! Affaires two days ago and had drav/n his attention to these facts. M, Arasteh, the Persian Ambassador-Designate to Moscow, had also been present. M. Aliev had been amiable but unhelpful and had repeated his Ambassador*s remarks to the effect that an improvement in economic relations must be preceded by an improvement in political relations. M. Hikmat had repeated the reply which he gave to Minister Sadtchikov that there could be no improvement in political relations v/hile the Soviet Government continued to flood this country with hostile propaganda. The only way to break the vicious circle was therefore to stop it. Unless this were done, the Persian Government might have to consider starting a Russian service from Tehran. 3. M. Hikmat seemed to be / m *&gt;r - - 2 - SEGIIBT Tehran telegram No. 371 to Foreign Office. 3, M. Hiknat seemed to he convinced that the real am of Soviet pressure was still to secure the withdrawal of the Persian case from the Security Council. I therefore read out to him paragraphs 2 and 3 of your telegram No, 335 of which I happened to have a copy with me. The Minister' said that he quite agreed with your paragraph 2 and with the first part of your paragraph 3* But he very definitely disagreed with your conclusion that this episode could 'be regarded as closed. Finally in reply to my question, he said.that he had received reports of impending trouble in Kurdistan (Bagdad telegram No. to Tehran) but he did not appear to attach much importance.to them. The Military Attach^ has since informed me that this is also the view held by the Persian General Staff (my telegram No. 72 to Bagdad). 5. The impression that I derived was that M. Hikmat is. mainly concerned to find some means of breaking ’’the vicious circle' to which he referred and that although he may not admit it, he is still wedded to the idea of withdrawing the. Persian case from the United Nations as soon as an.opportunity offers. I do not believe there have been any sinister new developments which he was concealing from me.

The electoral law was considered premature in some quarters and general elections could not be delayed for its passage without infringing the funda mental law. The election would therefore be held on the basis of the existing law and preparations for it would start at once. The Shah said he was determined that it should be as free as was humanly possible. I said that if it were it would be in marked contrast to everything had heard of the recent elections, me agreed and said that he was determined that there snould not be a repetition of this performance. 3. The Shah then said that the Soviet Government had recently made an offer to conclude an economic agreement ..ith Persia which had every appearance of being serious. Vhile realising that this might be a bait to draw Persia into more extensive discussions, he did not wish the offer to be rejected out of hand. -eut he is disposed to abstain for the present from any initiative either in regard to this matter or to Soviet request for the withdrawal of the Persian case from the Security Council. He was most anxious to know whether I had received any com.lent on his proposal for direct aid to Persia either in the framework of the oauaaDad Pact or otherwise. 1 ‘-r « the Adverting to the Seven-Years Plan the Shall said that in next few days certain key appointments ould be made and /he indicated variousAd |TS \0 V. ’ sijc:^T Teiiran telegraiu ..o. 346 to Foreign Office, - 2 - he indicated various alternative possibilities. I refused to volunteer an opinion in regard to candidates for the post of Director General, but advised Kis llajesty very strongly against the appointment of his brother Prince aodul neza as titular Director General (see my letter to right G52/73/49 of r.pril 19tn). I said uhat no ^ood could possioly cone of such a divorce of power from responsxDility, but I hoped that his highness would continue to supervise the Plan as hitherto in an Honorary capacity. The Shah seemed to agree and, after some further discussion, to be in favour of appointing Li. faghi hasr as Director General. He several times expressed conviction that the plan could not be launched 'without foreign aid of some hind, and said quite openly that Hbtchai had been sadly mistaken in thinning other- ..ise. But he recognised that without Eptehaj's full co-operation the Plan could not be a success, and he hoped to be able to reconcile him to the appointment of h. Taghi Kasr. 5. The 3hah said that he looked forward to seeing bir william Fraser and to reaching a satisfactory agree ment with the Company during his visit. 1 said that I shared his majesty's hopes but I warned him that during the past fortnight tne Persian Government have confronted Hr. Gass with a number of shares ./hich if conceded would change the character of tne Concession and would deprive the Company of effective control of future operations. Cuch tactics jere deplorable, and I only hope that with the Chairman’s arrival discussions ,/ould tame a ,.iore realistic turn.

Since the Shah has taken the line that it would he undesirable to make a reference to the Security Council in the absence of far more definite guarantees from the Western Powers, the Persian Government, if they now reluc tantly yielded to further pressure from us to inform the Security Council, might well consider that they had estab lished a claim for economic and military support which neither His Majesty’s Government nor the United States Government are ready to pledge in advance. 2. It is clear from our exchange of views that it would be to Persia’s disadvantage to pursue the suggestion of offering to withdraw the Persian case from the Security Council provided the Soviet Government declared Article 6 to be null and void, and if you have not already done so you should advise the Persian Government against this proposal, 3. As regards the action which Persia should take in response to Soviet request, I am of the opinion that as the Soviet Ambassador's enquiry was oral, the Persians axe under no obligation to return a written reply• I should hope that Hikmat's statement reported in your telegram No. 335 [of 22nd April] combined with the final exchanges between the Persian Foreign Minister and the Soviet Ambassador before the latter left for Moscow may prove sufficient to close this episode. /i.

Since March 1948 Soviet frontier guards have several times violated Persian territory. Two of these incidents occurred on the Atrak River and the others in Azerbaijan. In particular a short time ago Soviet frontier guards opened fire at Naftlja on the Aprak on three Persi n soldiers who were, without, any possibility of doubt, on Persian territory. One v/as killed and two captured. Later the Soviet frontier guards opened fire on a Persian patrol at Qanli Bulagh in the Moghan steppe on Persian territory wounding one soldier. As soon as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed of these incidents oral and written representations were made about each of them, both in Tehran and Moscow. The Ministry protested against the violation of Persian territory asking for the punishment of those concerned and indemnity for the victims, tne return of the prisoners and measures to prevent repetition of these unfortunate incidents. In consequence the two prisoners returned with their arms and it is to be hoped that in consequence of direct negotiations and the settlement of frontier disputes between the two countries no more incidents will occur. The now Persian Ambassador in Moscow has received instructions to settle all these questions with the Soviet G-overnment. /3. In reply7 7 7 7 TEHRaN TELi&amp;RiM NO, 335 TO FOREIGN OFFICE - 2 • 3.

Moreover though relations between Persia and our neighbours are based on treaties, we are members of the United Nations and every grievance between one country and another which cannot be solved arnicaoly must be referred to the United Nations.

The Embassy accordingly ask if we could let them have any details that are available regarding past and present plans of this kind which have been adopted in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. 2. I enclose herewith a copy of a Note about the Persian Seven Year Plan. I should be most grateful if you could let me have any relevant information about similar plans in the Commonwealth which we could pass on to the Persian Embassy. V (C. Waterlow)(Miss) R.W.D.Fowler Esq Commonwealth Relations Office.(E 2499/1103/34) PERSIA’S SEVEN YEAR PLAN. The Plan was first announced in the Spring of 1946, but this Plan which would have cost a total of about 450 million pounds was far beyond the financial capacity of the Persian Government and in order to arrive at a more selective programme and to be able to judge which schemes were economically sound, the Persian Government invited a Commission of United States engineers to visit the country. The Commission arrived at the end of 1946, and after completing their investigations, they submitted a report to the Persian Government in July, 1947^ The general finding of the Commission was that Persia’s major efforts should be directed towards an increased efficiency in agricultural production and it was emphasised that industry should be left to develop slowly and naturally. The planners prepared a list of schemes which they considered should be carried out under the 250 million dollar programme. The present bill is based on this report and envisages a development programme to be carried out in 7-8 years at a cost of 21,000 million rials or at the official rate of exchange- some 160 million pounds to be expended as follows Per the year 1948-49 »• » ' -) 949-50 »» »&gt; »» 1950—51 ” ” ' 1951-52 ” ” ' 1952-53 ” ” ” 1 953-54 ” ” ” 1954-55 ” ” ” 1955-56 1,000 million rials. 2,000 ” ” 2,800 ” ” 3,200 ” ' 3,500 ” ” 3,600 ” ” 3,600 ” ” 2,200 ” ” The importance of the present Plan lies in the fact that It is the first attempt to carry out a long-term Plan of economic reform in Persia which has been effectively prevented in recent years by the lack of continuity in governments (there have been some 90 governments in the 42 years since the proclamation of the Constitution) and according to Article 1 of the Lav/ the Plan is designed ’’for the purpose of increasing the productive capacity and expansion in the volume of exports, preparing public requirements at home, improvement in agriculture and industry, exploitation of mines and other resources especially oil, completion of means of transport, reforms in public health and for carrying out measures in the development of the country, raising the general standard of life and education, bettering employment conditions and reduction in the cost of living”. For these various purposes the total sum available has been allotted hs follows Agriculture and irrigation .„ .. Motor-roads, railways, ports, and aerodromes .. Extension and development of industries, exploration and exploitation of mines .. Iranian Oil Company .. .. ,, Million rials. 57235 5,000 3,000 1 ,000 Extension/Million rials Extension of post, telegraph, wireless, radio and telephone .00 Building of cheap houses creation of water-systems and supply of power to the provinces Prevention of disease and prophylactic measures with the object of improving public health ^ . * * Aid to educational institutions and training of technical experts Scientific studies and research map-making preparation of statistics and other v/orks of public utility Prisons ., *. , • .. 0 »c . - * &lt;&gt; • 750 1,500 1,000 1,500 1,000 800 200 The question of financing the execution of the Plan has still to be settled and is likely to present difficulties as the sum available from the A*I,0„C’s royalties which have been ear-marked for development projects inside Persia over the next seven years will depend on the result of the Company’s present negotiations With the Persian Government e The Persians have also still to negotiate a loan for specific development projects from the International Bank,- These difficulties should not, however, prevent the Government proceeding with the first year's programme and, provided the political situation permits, the Persians should be in a position to make a start shortly on those essential measures of economic development to which we attach the greatest importance as the only sure d3fence against Communism. The Government have already engaged an American group - Overseas Consultants Incorporated - to draw up a report on the priorities to be given to the various projects included in the Plan and an advance party of this group with which the British firm Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners is associated is now in Tehran., Mr* Murray of the B.M.E.O. has been asked to supervise the statistical work and the Americans have also agreed in principle to the engagement of an expert from the Port of London Authority to advise on port clearance problems. According to the Law as now passed the report which is to be prepared by this group is now to be submitted to the Persian Planning Organisation within three months. The Bill provides for a Supreme Planning Authority, consisting of an Advisory Council of seven members, a Board of Control of six members and a Managing Director. As originally drafted, the Advisci'y Council would be appointed by the Shah on the proposal of the Government and would hold office for the whole period of the programme. The Managing Director would be appointed for three years but his appointment could be renewed for the remaining period of the Plan The Board r&gt;f Control would be elected by the Majlis and would hold office for two years. The Government of the Day ’would be connected with the Planning Organisation through the Board of Control/€ Control v/hich would have the right to report direct to the Government and might be charged by the Government to carry out investigations. The Planning Organisation are required to obtain the approval of the Council of Ministers before employing foreign experts who may be employed for a period not exceeding one year after the period of the execution of the programme. In passing the Law, the Majlis have amended the draft Bill to ensure that all appointments to the Planning Organisation should be approved by them before being confirmed by the Shah and have stipulated that credits under the Plan should only be used for paying technical personnel and not for increasing salaries. They have also laid down that the Planning Authority is to be staffed with Civil Servants drawn from Ministries who will continue to receive their present salaries. We have not received full details of these amendments but it would seem that the Majlis have now imposed a stricter control on the authority of the Advisory Council to carry out the programme on its own authority once it has been approved by the Seven Year Plan Commission of the Majlis. This is unfortunate as it may complicate the practical application of the Plan. It is, however, to be hoped that the Persians will appreciate the necessity for engaging foreign experts to assist the Planning Organisation in the detailed execution of the programme and that these advisers will be able to prevent to some extent the Government of the Day frittering away the sums allotted to the various projects in the grant of fictitious contracts to their friends and supporters. Both His Majesty’s Government and the United' States Government have on all possible occasions stressed the importance of economic development and reform to the Shah and to the Persian Government. It is to be hoped that the satisfactory co-operation established between the American group of Overseas Consultants and the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners in the initial planning stages of the programme is symptomatic of the collaboration which can be expected in the measures which are to be taken in the later stages to raise the standard of living in Persia and to improve the social and economic position of the Persian peasant who has for so long been exploited by a small and wealthy minority of land-owners and merchants.[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

Addressed to F oreign Office telegram No.297 of 7th April, repeated for information to Washington, Moscow and saving B.M.E.O. (Cairo). Soviet-Persian Relations. The Shah received me today and spoke at some length about alternative methods discussed in my telegram No.294- of dealing with the Soviet request (it was oral and not in writing)'for the withdrawal of the Persian case from the Security Council. 2. His Majesty took the [gp. undec] that it would be undesirable to ask the Soviet Government to recognize the invalidity of Article 6 of 1921 Treaty either on the lines suggested in the third draft or othery/ise. He was however opposed to a reference to the Security Council in the absence of far more definite guarantees of economic and military support than he had so far received from the Western Powers. He is inclined to think that as an immediate measure the Persian Government might reply to the Soviet reauest in a note on the lines of Ala’s second draft and at the same time warn the Soviet Government that if the pressure on the Persians were maintained they would be obliged to refer to the Security Council. 3. As regards the Atlantic Pact, the Shah seemed to understand why it could not be extended to include Middle Eastern Powers, but he reverted in this context to the urgent need for a more specific as surance of material support. He wondered whether a reinforcement of the Saadabad Pact would facilitate this; or the reverse. I promised to seek guidance on this point. . Please see my immediately following telegram.

On 20th March three Persian soldiers were attacked near Neftilja (scene of the third incident in my telegram No. 669) on Persian soil by 50 Soviet troops v/ho killed one and took away the others as prisoners. Shortly afterwards about 500 Soviet troops appeared near Neftilja and ordered the Persian Commander to v/ithdraw further south. The Persian officer refused and the post was reinforced on instructions from Tehran. In .spite of further Soviet intimidation (including the appearance on the scene of a few tanks) The Soviet troops ultimately withdrew though the prisoners were still in their hands. 3. The Persian Embassy in Moscow handed in a note of protest on about 22nd March and demanded an apology and indemnity. The Soviet Ambassador here, however, made light of the incident and said that it was a matter of no importance which could be settled locally. A. The actual frontier line at Neftilja is apparently under dispute (the Military Attachd sent topographical details to the War Office last December) and there is said to be ‘a small gusher of oil at Neftilja.

Your telegram No. 422 [sic]. Closure of Soviet Consulates in Persia. Absurd as it may seem I think the Russians rate the usefulness of the Persian Consulate General at Baku much higher than the estimate given in paragraph 4 of your telegram No, 3287 to Washington. For example Secretary of Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party emphasised at the recent Party Congress the need for intensified vigilance M to deny any access to our Republic and to Baku in particular, to enemy agents, diversionaries, spies, wreckers and all doubtful, suspicious persons. 2. But primary reasons for Soviet move seem to me (admittedly under all reserve) to be two-fold: (a) Soviet Government are notoriously sensitive to snubs. They have recently sustained a first-class snub through Norway's attitude in the matter of the Atlantic Pact and have shown their sensitiveness to it by handling Denmark in a different way (through an indirect approach by the Polish Governnent). Tehran telegram No. 237 to you paragraph 3, shows that tiie Persian Government have been pressing for the suppresion of at least some of the Soviet Consulates, Soviet Government would undoubtedly much.prefer to anticipate any request of this kind by closing the posts themselves. Closure of Soviet Consulates in the United States last year though circumstances are not.exactly comparable, serves to illustrate characteristic Soviet reaction in a matter involving prestige. (b) . Soviet Government are at the moment, according to many indications extremely anxious to conserve foreign exchange and even more personnel, in which respect their / trained CadresG G G G CONFIDENTIAL Moscow telegram No. 252 to Foreign Office - 2 - trained Cadres are strained to the limit. It seems to me arguable that their action in Persia is directly due to their feeling that their men and their money may be more profitably employed in the more promising fitfJds offered by other Asiatic countries. 3. In short, I estimate that Soviet move ought to bring some measure of reassurance to.‘ the Persian Government. No doubt Moscow Radio is still pouring out abuse of Persia. But Soviet press of recent weeks has contained only iust so much anti-Persian material as may prevent an observer from entertaining the suspicions which complete silence would arouse.

As you will have seen from my telegram No, 57 the Russians are already on the move, and it seems quite likely that these have already decided to withdraw all their Consulates. If they eventually decide to retain a Consul in Persia [?Grp. omtd.] expect him to be at Pahlevi which as you know is the H.Q. of Caspian fisheries. 4-.

For the reasons set out below I an inclined to think ^ ^ that the Persian Governnent would be wise to adopt the Shah .s suggestions to (a) offer to withdraw the Persian case from tne Security Council provided, the Soviet Government on their pa.rt agreed to allow article 6 of -the 1921 Treaty to be regarded as null and void, and » (b) agree to the. mutual withdrawal of consular representatives from each others territories. 2. The chances of the Soviet Government agreeing to the first proposal are remote. ^ ’’friendly gesture” of this nature would however have tactical advantages for tne Persians in that a Soviet refusal to consider such an offer would strengthen Persia’s case against the Soviet Government before the Security Council and in world opinion. 3. In the unlikely event of the Soviet accepting this proposal the advantage would still lie with tne Persians as an acknowledgement that xirticle 6 was obsole go world aeprive the Soviet Government of a powerful propaganda weapon as they could no longer claim that the activities of the United States Military Mission in Persia were incompatible with the terms of the 1921 Treaty and would justify a Soviet invasion of Persia. On the other hand the Persian quid pro 'quo would / only mean giving upForeign OlTicc teleRraj'.! ]\ T o^3287 to l/ashington / - 2 - only mean giving up the immediate advantage of being able to obtain publicity in the Security Council for Persia's differences with the Soviet Government (a right of which she has taken no advantage since 194.6) and conceding to the Soviet Government a possible advantage from the delay which night occur before the Security Council could be again seized of the Persian-ooviet dispute. Persian agreement to the withdrawl of the present dispute could not however , deprive her of the right to ask the Security Council at some later date to consider again the question of Sovict-Persian relations. 4. In regard to (b) the advantages to Persia in accepting the Soviet challenge by agreeing to the mutual withdrawl of all Soviet and Persian consular representatives from each others territories seen overwhelming. The Soviet Government have effectively prevented Persia’s solitary consul-general at Baku ' from carrying out even his normal consular duties and the value of this post to Persia as a reporting centre must be very slight. On the other hand in addition to their various Yoks reading rooms the Soviet maintain 12 consular establishments in Persia and their representatives who are relatively free to move within their consular districts can act as a focus for elements hostile to the Shall and the Persian Government, although the Soviet satellites have missions at Tehran they do not maintain consular establishments outside •• the capital which would take the place of the Soviet consulates should these be closed down. 5. Please communicate the gist of the telegram under reference with my comments to the State Department as I should be glad to know whether the State Department agree with riy views before sending final instructions to Tehran.[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on], Cypher/OTP * DIPLOMATIC DISTRIBUTION.

Tehran telegram to you No.227 and previous correspondence. Suggested United States declaration concerning Persia. i am not of course competent to judge likely repercussions of such a declaration- in Persia or the Soviet Union. I am inclined however to deprecate in any case the idea of the Security Council being chosen as the forum for such a declaration either in the shape of a communication addressed to the President of the Council but not necessarily calling for action by that body, or a fortiori if it were proposed that the Council should once more take up the Persian case, which as you know remains on its cause list despite action taken by Persian Government in 194-6 for its removal. 2. I understand from paragraph 3 of Washington telegram No.1325 that State Department are in fact not (repeat not) thinking of suggesting that the Council should take any action. But even a communication to President of the Council might, apart from its provocative effect on the Russians, be resented by some members of the Council as bringing another controversial issue within its purview without any obvious reason and at a time when the Council is fairly heavily occupied with other matters. As seen from here, therefore, it would appear preferable to keep the matter out of the Council and for the United States Government, if they wish to react to Soviet propaganda and other threats to the situation in Persia, to do so by means of counter-propaganda through similar media or some action corresponding to an inspired parliamentary question.

Soviet Ambassador called on Minister for Foreign Afiairs yesterday and renewed his previous suggestion that Persian Government could best demonstrate their desire for friendly relations with the Soviet Union by finally withdrawing their case from the agenda of the Security Council. 2. Mr. Hajir who brought me this information on behalf of the Shah said that in view of United States Ambassador*s insistence on action by Persia to counter Soviet threats to invoke the 1921 Treaty His Majesty was now considering replying to Mr. Sadtchikov*s latest representations as follows. He might be told that Persia would be prepared to withdraw her case from the Security Council provided that the Soviet Government agreed to allow Article 6 of the 1921 Treaty and correspondence based thereon to be regarded as null and void. Mr. Hajir admitted that he did not believe that the Soviet Government would agree to this but if they refused it would be clear they were reserving the right to act in certain circumstances without reference to the United Nations Charter. The proposed reply therefore seemed to provide an adequate response to pressure which the Persian Government is at present countering both from Soviet and from American ambassadors. In reply to Mr. Hajir f s question I said speaking personally I was inclined to agree with him but that I should prefer to consult you before expressing a definite opinion. 3. Mr. Hajir then/....SECRET Tehran telegram No c 237 to Foreign Office. ~ 2 - 3. Mr. Hajir then said that the Soviet Government had now replied to the request made by the Persian Government some months ago for an equalisation of numbers of consulates maintained by one country in the territory of the other. The Persians have only one consulate at Baku and before the war the Soviet's had- only one at Bander Pahler. The Persians regard the increase in number of Soviet consuls in Persia as a purely war-time expediency but Soviet Government have now replied saying if there is to be any change they will withdraw all their consulates and require the Persians to do the same. The.Shah is wondering whether balance of advantage may not be in favour of such a course. I said that again speaking personally I much doubted if it would be. It'would certainly not be regarded as a friendly gesture by the Soviets (or by any one else) and would further complicate a^ situation which is already very difficult. Moreover, the Soviets would still be able, through satellite missions here, to continue their subversive activities. For these reasons alone I thought it would be better to defer any response to the latest Soviet Note on this subject for the present.

Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 185 of 27th February repeated to Washington and Saving to Moscow and B.M.E.O. (Cairo). My telegram No. 184: Constituent Assembly. Following is full text of Shah's statement as reported in semi-official press. [Begins] My object in meeting you tonight is to communicate an important matter to you. You are of course aware that the present situation of the country is extremely confused, poverty, disaster, misery and disease ,have enveloped the country and no useful work can be performed by the apparatus of the Government. For example, no budget has been approved by the Majlis for five years and nothing has been done to improve society. All this is quite foreign, to my wishes and convictions and I have expressed myself in this sense on many occasions. The cause of this confusionis that the constitution and democratic system of Persia bear no resemblance to the constitution of any other country. As confirmed by the original champions of the consitution who drafted the fundamental laws and many of whom are present tonight this defect of the constitution was at that time intentional. There is no doubt that unless the various executive forces of the constitution are balanced against each other, nothing but confusion in the country will result. I, and no doubt everyone, is opposed to absolute executive power and believe that the legislature should supervise and control the executive. In particular the legislature should carefully examine and approve the country's budget. Similarly if the legislature should unfortunately be in error and a deadlock be created, the head of the State should be able to solve the difficulty by new elections and thus ascertain what new opinion is held by the people. Thus, like all progressive and democratic countries which have achieved a balance of forces, we too have to find a way out just as they did after long years of experience. /I must againim Tehran telegram No,. 185 to Foreign Office. - 2 - I must again repeat that in our country we have not a constitution in the proper sense of the word as other countries have and individuals do not share alike the advantages of real constitutional liberty. With the right to order new elections vested in the head of the state the people will be in better position to control their destiny and at the same time the elections will be carried.out much more freely and correctly. I am ready to sacrifice my life for the country at any time and I cannot allpw my name to be bandied about by a few ignorant people who wish to profit by defects in the constitution and drive the country to confusion and destruction. I n view of the foregoing and after consultation with the authors of the constitution, I have decided to convoke a Constituent Assembly. In doing’ this I have two objects in view: every law in the passage of time and as new situations arise requires certain amendments so that it shall conform to modern requirements. Such amendments were, unfortunately, not foreseen in our constitution and the first requirement therefore will be to find a means of amending the constitution to .the advantage of the State and of society. The second object is the amendment of Article 48 of the supplementary fundamental laws.. If by the convocation of the Constituent Assembly the Majlis does not succeed in passing the Senate Bill and in approving a new electoral law based on the principles of liberty and democracy which will limit the duration of the elections throughout the country to a period of one month, these two matters 'will be submitted to the Constituent Assembly. The^Government has been duly instructed to make preparations for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.

In the presence of the Prime Minister, the President of the Majlis and several elder statesmen, the Shah explained that in view of the urgent need of speeding up progressive legislation he proposed to convoke a constituent assembly at an early date which would (a) have powers to remove some of the ^mut g^7 of the constitution which are net compatible with modern principles and (b) provide the necessary authority for the dissolution in case of need of either the Legislative Assembly or the Senate or both. This was necessary since it was improper for the Majlis to control the state when there was no authority to control the Majlis. 2. The leaders of the Fractions asited for permission to discuss the matter with their colleagues. The Shah pointed out that the convocation of the constituent assembly was the duty of the Government. He was merely keeping the deputies informed. He had, however, no objection to them consulting their colleagues and reporting to him by the afternoon of Monday 28th February. 3. On the 25 th February the formal firman ordering the elections for the 16th Majlis was issued. It contained no mention of a constituent assembly.

This, as .shorn by Washington telegram No. 1047 [of February 21st] would produce a most unfavourable reaction in America and would we believe cause nearly if not quite as much danger to internal Persian stability as. course (1) above even if the Shah could find a government willing to carry it out which seems very doubtful-;.. . v (3) a modified method of constitutional reform on the lines proposed by Hajir in your telegram No, 165 fof February 19th] i.e, no immediate dissolution, (and therefore,. the continuance in.being of the present Majlis until the end of its legal term,) the. adoption of the normal legal procedure for summoning a new Majlis, and the convening’of a constitutional assembly meanwhile in order to carry out certain specific and limited constitutional reforms. It would, as pointed out in Washington telegram under reference, be extremely desirable that if this method were adopted the procedure should be approved either before or after the event or at least not actively opposed, by the Majlis, but I do not quite see how any governmentSECRET P.O. telegram No« 157 to Tehran, 2 . how any government however strong, can necessarily guarantee this, i.e. I am not quite sure v/hether there is a hard and fast line 'between the second and third alternatives set out hy the State Department in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Washington telegram under reference. 2. There seems no doubt that of these three alternatives the third is hy far the least had. It would he still further improved if action was only taken after consultation with elder statesmen as suggested in paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 169.- - You should therefore at your audience with the Shah speak; on the general lines of my telegram No. 145, adding, unless your American colleague is already taking, action on these lines, that you believe that his original proposal might have the additional disadvantage of indisposing important sections of American opinion at a critical moment. You should go on to say that if the Shah is nevertheless^determined to take action of some kind you believe that the wisest method of proceeding would he for him to have further consultations with elder statesmen either separately or together, and with their approval to act on the lines proposed hy Hajir in the hope, that with a. strong government the Majlis while remaining in office will either agree with or at least not oppose what is done hy the government and the constituent assembly. You should make it clear that we are not advocating this course. ? ut t0 the ? hah tha difficulties wnicn ne is likely to meet in pursuing the course which he proposes and a way in which we think these difficulties may he reduced.

C^airo) (Foreign Office please pass copies by fast bag as my telegrams Nos. 10 and 58) and Washington. Your telegram No. 145 has crossed my telegram No. 165 from v/hich you will see that the situation has changed considerably since my telegrams Nos. 1L2 and 151 were drafted. Issue of electoral decree can hardly be delayed beyond the end of this week and I should therefore see the Shah within the next day or two if my representations are to be effective. 2. I have already been over most of the ground covered by paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 145 both with the Shah and with Hajir, and I will do so again but I doubt if I shall make much impression on His Majesty. My own view is that reaction of politically conscious elements here to this plan will be determined by the attitude of elder statesmen such as Taqiz[gp. undec.]h, Tabatabai, Hakimi etc. who are sometimes called 'fathers of the Constitution'. If these elder statesmen are now genuinely in favour of certain constitutional reforms opposition inspired from abroad is unlikely to weigh in the balance. It is not yet clear however whether in objecting to a dissolution Kakimi and Tabatabai are merely seeking a pretext to obstruct the whole plan because they dare not oppose it outright. Again it is not clear whether they are in favour of certain reforms and not of others. It would be most unwise for me to probe into this question now but it does not in any case affect the line I wish to take with the Shah. 3. The present danger as I see it is that by employing unconstitutional methods in defiance of all sound advice even to attain constitutional ends, the Shah will undermine...,SECRET Tehran telegram No. 169 to Foreign Office - 2 - will undermine confidence in himself and in his aims both at home and abroad. He will in this sense be embarking on an experiment which is almost certain to involve him in a dictatorship, whether he wishes it or not. If on the other hand the Shah drops the idea of a dissolution and confines himself to persuading the Government to convene a Constituent Assembly (see my telegram No. 165) this danger need not arise. A. I therefore feel I should see the Shah within the next 48 hours and speak to him on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 165 and I hope you will instruct me to do so. 5. Charge d'Affaires with whom I have been in close touch throughout is in agreement with above. Foreign Office pass Washington as my telegram [Repeated to Washington and Saving to B.M.E.O.

SECRET Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No, 1.047 of 21st February repeated for information to Tehran, Moscow and B.M.E*0.(Cairo). Your telegram No. 2,010; Persia. State Department are in general agreement with line suggested in your telegram No. 145 to Tehran, but their impression is that the Shah may not now be dissuaded by reiteration of these familiar arguments and they therefore feel that, while they should be used, they do not go quite far enough. 2, Whilst State Department do not quite understand why present Government is unsatisfactory to the Shah or where a new 'strong' Government is to come from, there are, as they see it, three situations with which we may have to deal. The first is dissolution. On this they are in full agreement with the views expressed in paragraph 2 of Tehran telegram No. 165. The second is Hajir^s suggestion contained in paragraph 3 of Tehran telegram No. 165 with. a strong Government in the sense that it will be subservient to the Shah and will carry out his wishes whatever the views of the Majlis. The third is Ha jir r s^suggestion with a strong Government in the sense that it will be able to persuade the Majlis to fall in with the proposal to convoke a Constituent Assembly. 3. The State Department feel that dissolution must be resisted with all possible arguments. In addition to using those contained in paragraph 3 of your telegram No, 145 to Tehran they are thinking of pointing out to the Shah that such a step would have adverse effectsboth on United States public opinion and on Persia s position (see paragraph 1 of my telegram No. 616). If it were taken, it would be very difficult for the United States to extend to Persia the kind of support against foreign pressure /and threats which■■qgPMMr’fc'VTA'.: • SECRET Washington telegram No. 1.047 to Foreign Office, and threats which had been extended in the past and which the United States Government hoped to be able to extend in the future* It might also be pointed out to the Shah that the internal troubles which would be caused in Persia by such a step would make it difficult for the United States Government and perhaps also for the International Bank, to provide financial assistance in connexion with the Seven Year Plan. The State Department believe that such arguments should weigh very heavily with the Shah. 4, State Department consider that the same line should be taken.if Hajir s suggestion were adopted with a new Govern ment intended to be strong in the sense that it would ignore the views of the Majlis, In such circumstances the Govern ment might be defeated in the Majlis and the Shah would then have either to giveaway, which would be a serious blow to his prestige, or to proceed unconstitutionally with his plans in defiance of serious opposition and perhaps disorder within Persia and of much criticism abroad. The State Department believe that, if the Shah were to defy the Majlis, the situation would be as dangerous as that which would be created by a dissolution and that this, too, must thereford be prevented if possible, 5, # Should a strong Government in this context only mean that it is one which can persuade the Majlis to agree to the convocation of a Constituent Assembly, the State Department feel that the course suggested in paragraphs 3 a ftd 4 of your telegram No. 145 to Tehran should be followed and the Shah be left to get on with his reforms if he is unwilling to listen to our advice. The State Department think that the major dangers would be avoided if a proper constitutional procedure were followed by the Shah in this manner, even though there would undoubtedly be hostile criticism from the Tudeh party and other malcontents. 6, These are at present the views of the Greek, Turkish and Persian Division of the State Department only, but they hope to get approval for the despatch of instructions in this sense to the United States Embassy at Tehran in a day or two, and they suggest that questions of timing should be worked out by our two representatives at Tehran.

Washington and British Middle East Office (Cairo). r ^^grams Nos. 142 and 151, latter not repeated [of February 11th and 16th: Persian constitution]. It seems to us that any attempt to upset the internal stability of Persia must consist of two phases. One would ^ exploitation of bad political, social and economic conditions by labour agitation and propaganda of all kinds. There is no doubt that the Tudeh Party aided by Russia are steadily carrying on this kind of activity. The second phase would be if the Tudeh passed from this kind of preparatory stage to direct action with a view to overthrowing the.regime and obtaining political power themselves. If it is true- that the recent attempt on the Shah s life was planned by the Tudeh, this would be evidence that they were entering on this second phase but so far we are not altogether convinced that it was more than the work of an individual fanatic. 2. The inefficiency of the government and the failure • to adopt urgently needed social and economic reforms have up till now mhde the Tudeh ! s task in the preparatory phase a comparatively easy one. They have not so far been able to make much play v/ith political grievances owing to -the respect felt for the constitution as guarding political liberties after the dictatorship of the late Shah. - But if it could be represented that the constitution was being tampered with and that a new military dictatorship was being imposed, this would give agitators a new and most powerful weapon, the value- of which would not be seriouslv reduced even if at the same time the regime could point to considerable achievements in the sphere of social and economic reform. These latter measures seldom have the /emotive forceSECRET Foreign Office telegram No, H5 to Tehran emotive force--of •political slogans even though in fact they have a far greater effect on the lives of the people. 3* Martial law may well be necessary and desirable as an immediate result of the attempt on the Shah but in the long run it is not a sufficient answer to criticism pf inacceptable political and'economic conditions and should only be used as a temporary expedient. If the Tudeh Party have passed from the preparatory stage to a phase of more direct political action, then martial law provides the opportunity 'for dealing effectively with any such attempts to upset the stability -of' the state by violence. But this should be a short-term affair, the object of which should be an early return to normal conditions. 4. In the light .of these considerations the main . question for a -Shafr is to balance the advantage of* quick f; and decisive improvement in economic and.social conditions which he may hope to obtain through speeding up constitutional procedure and through the concentration of greater power in his own hands, against the very important political v/eapon which he will put in s the hands of his opponents and the opponents , of ordered progress in Persia by an attempt to tamper with the constitution which will undoubtedly be represented as a prelude to a thorough-going dictatorship on the lines of that imposed by his father. The fact that the Majlis have now passed the Seven Year Plan Bill suggests that there may be a good hope of early action in the social and economic sphere without prior 1 constitutional change and if so this greatly strengthens the arguments against the Shah's programme* 5. I agree that we cannot stand in the Shah's way if he is determined to carry out his reforms, some of which we agree are in themselves intrinsically desirable if only they were not accompanied by the disadvantages outlined above. I think your best course will be to set.out the position as we see it on the lines of the preceding paragraphs to the Shah but to make it clear that if bearing all these factors in mind he still feels it necessary to go ahead with his plan, we shall not wish to say anything- more and shall continue to give such support as we can to the maintenance of Persian stability and to orderly social and economic development. If the Shah is impressed by the force of the arguments mentioned above (or if he fails to find a Government willing to carry out his-.programme) he may perhaps see advantage in trying in the more favourable atmosphere which has now been created to persuade the Majlis to improve its own procedure in regards to the quorum, etc. As regardsOUTWARD TELEGRAM SECRET ^ Foreign Office telegram No. H5 to Tehran OL 6 .

During routine conversation on Persia, State Department said that, so far as they knev/, no definite progress had been made by Persian Government with its proposal to communi cate Soviet-Persian exchanges to the Security Council. State Department's own attitude was as described in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 618. But they had nevertheless recently been giving some thought to the possibility on issuing a unilateral American statement (paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference) since they did not want Soviet »&gt; charges to remain too long unanswered, although, as you rightly assume in your first paragraph, they did not propose to take any action in the immediate future. \ 2, As their thoughts have been moving in that direction however we spoke to them on the lines of paragraphs 2 and 3 of your telegram under reference and they took note of the point which you made. I think it would be advisable for us to keep in touch with them about this, since they are evidently still worried by the continuance without challenge of Soviet accusations about American activities in Persia and by the fact that the Persians have never pointed out to the world at large that Soviet rights under Article 6 of the 1921 Treaty are inconsistent with the United Nations Charter.

The Ambassador also protested against the closing of the Soviet book-shop in Tehran which took place at the time of the measures against the Tudeh. The Minister had said that the Persians wished to live in friendship with the Soviet Union and the Ambassador immediately took him up by asking why. in that case the Persian Government did not withdraw their appeal to the Security Council. Hikmat had replied that if Russians were prepared to do something tangible to show their friendship for Persia he personally would be prepared to consider the withdrawal of the appeal. 2, There has been strong criticism in Persian press of the attitude of Moscow wireless which has slurred over the attempt on the Shah's life, complained about establishment of martial law and defended the Tudeh Party, alleging that it had been deliberately victimised and was in no way responsible for the Shah's assailant. The Persian Government are also exercised about a report in this morning's B.B.C.'s transmission to the effect that a further Soviet note had been received. I have heard nothing of this.

In the meantime should the State Department ask you for our preliminary views you should say that whilst we do not oppose the issue of a United States Government statement on the proposed lines, our exchange of views has confirmed us in the believe that if this is to achieve successfully the limited objectives referred to in your telegram No. 618 [51st January], the statement should be issued after the Persian Government have communicated the copies of the correspondence to the Security Council and not before. 5. To judge from a copy of a telegram to the United States Embassy. Tehran, shown to us by the United States Embassy here, the United States Government are not prepared to increase their commitments tov/ards Persia. A statement cut of the blue which included no reference to increased aid to Persia is not likely to stiffen Persian resistance to the Soviet and for the reasons given in my telegram No. 1225 [January 29th] might indeed have the opposite effect. 666666Sir.

Apart from the dressing on his upper lip, whicn somewhat impeded his speech, he seemed to be in normal health and spirits. 2* As soon as there was an opportunity I spoke in the sense of paragraph 5 of my telegram No.78 and explained that you had instructed me to do so. As I foresaw His Majesty pointed out that the incident of last week had entirely changed the outlook. He attached no importance to his personal share in this affair and said that he was strongly opposed to hasty or intemperate action of any kind but that this was certainly no time for hesitation or delay. If a decision to end political stalemate once and for all were not taken now, he did not believe that another opportunity would occur. 5. The Shah then said that he had decided on the following procedure. Instead of ordering general election in a fortnight's time he intended then to order the con vention of the Constituent Assembly and simultaneously to dissolve the Majlis. He expected that within three months from the issue of convening decree the Constituent assembly would have completed its work, including the* passage of Senate Bill and a new electoral law. The general election would follow immediately and under the revised procedure would be over in a month or six weeks.' There should in this way be little if any delay in conven tion of the 16th Majlis which is due at the end of July* I pointed out that this was precisely the kind of programme against which I had been instructed to advise him. I also repeatedSECRET, - Bfehran telegram No,142 to Foreign Office, - 2 - also repeated the arguments against convening a Constituent Assembly before the general election and warned His Majesty that he would be focusing the entire issue on himself and on the Grown but he stuck to his plan. 4. Thus contrary to the belief which I expressed at the end of my secret letter of 9th February to Wright, the Shah has now reverted to his insistence on Constituent; Assembly which immediately before the incident he was prepared to waive (see my telegram No.93). But I am bound to say that for reasons given in the above letter I entirely agree with His Majesty*s assessment of the present situation. If there were ever any doubt that the Communist party have been exploiting Persian selfishness and ineptitude to prepare the way for a violent change of regime, last week s incident has entirely dispelled it. Failure to take decisive action now will probably entail the overthrow of the present rdgime 'within the next few months. But the only perspn who is ready and able to take the required decision is the Shah. We should therefore reflect very carefully before doing or saying anything which will weaken his hand. 5. For these reasons I abstained from further comment on the Shah’s plan, but I pointed out that to execute it he should have the support of a more active and re Pr e §2 n ^ a J ive Government than the present one. The Shah said that he was well aware of this and that he proposed to call on Hakimi. Tabatabai and Ali Mansur in that order. To my objection that the first two were very elderly the Shah replied that both were loyal, honest and liberal minded and would be able to form a Government on the broadest possible . se * T . I’he ^same was not so true of Mansur. I asked how wide His Majesty thought the net could be cast, e.g., would it not be wise to include Seyyid Zia? His Majesty said that he would consider this suggestion but I do not believe that he intends to pursue it for although Seyyid Zia has now made his peace it was clear from what the Shah said that he does not trust him. 666666t 4 Gypher/OTP Confidential OUTWARD TELEGRAM •&gt;&lt; S 60 J 6 Ift&amp;ZXEZ { I34g POLITIG,AL DISTRIHJTTDN^- FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN No. 128 E&gt;. 7,40 p.m.lOth February, 1949 10th February, 1949, Repeated to: Washington No, 1674, B.M,E,0.(Cairo) No. 289.

Your telegram No.156 [of 10th February: Persian Government and British Interests]. I am not satisfied that there will be no recurrence of the campaign against our interests, but since there is a lull at present, I do not now wish to ask the Shah directly to interfere in the policy of his Government. I agree therefore that you should not make the request contained in paragraph 4 of my telegranpNo.104 [of 5th February], but I shall be glad if ypu will make to the Shah the general observations contained in paragraph 5, 2. I think you should also make representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at an early opportunity on the lines of paragraph 5 and 4 of my telegram No.104. zzzCypher/OTP POLITICAL DISTRIBUTION 63J9' JNDuXED FROM TBHRAM TO FOREIGN OFFISS --3 t? i C k-' ir J.LeRougetel, No. 136 9th February,19^9.

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL Addressed to Foreign Office No. 136 of 9th February, repeated for information to Washington, B.M.3.0.(Cairo). Persian Government and British Interests, Your telegrams Nos. 104 and 109 both crossed my telegram No. 122 and as all three pointed to the same conclusion i.e, that we should hold our hand for the present I abstained from further comment, 2. I have now discussed the substance of these telegrams and also your telegram No. 115 with Gass who arrived here this morning. Agitation against our interests has died away and he agrees with me that unless there is a revival, we here should continue to hold our hand. But we both feel that a serious background article or two in London press could do no harm and may be very helpful, I hope it will be made clear to the company that I never had in mind 'a sudden flare-up of critical articles 0 but merely one or two serious articles which could be lifted and used here. I should certainly not have suggested anything which might have had an adverse effect on their impending negotiations unless there had appeared to me to be overriding reasons for doing so. 3. With regard to paragraph 2 of your telegram No, 104, recent events have confirmed my opinion that had incident not occurred, nothing but the Shah’s direct and drastic intervention could have prevented the government and in particular Ministry of Finance,from becoming the tools of our inveterate opponents. 4, I have just heard that the Shah will receive me on February 11th but unless you instruct me to the contrary I do not propose to broach the subject of last week’s anti-British agitation unless it is first raised by His Majesty. I have not suggested to the Shah that you are sending him an official message but will convey your personal congratulations when I see him (your telegram No. 116), Foreign Office please pass to Washington as my telegram No. 18, [Repeated to Washington],V V V 6369 En Glair IN'ST^XED POLmCAI' DISTRtrBUTld^ 8 j PROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE.

The assailant Fakhrarai who died from his injuries a few hours later has now been fully identified. Though he gained access to the University precincts by obtaining a card as a representative of the religious paper 'Partcham Islam” (which is under the influence of Kashani) documents found on him show that he was a member of the Tudeh Party. 2, The incident was followed: (a) by the resignation of the Government which was not accepted. (b) by a decree establishing marshal law and a curfew in the capital, and (c) by the proscription of the Tudeh Party throughout the country and the arrest of some 20 of its leaders. Decrees (b) and (c) were approved by a special session of the Majlis on February 5th. /K‘ ! So £&gt;&lt;/ &lt;5' Uj Ilu 4 . 1 u. ib\ CN L 1 V, 3. Persons arrested include the religious leader Kashani who has been exiled to Khorramabad and a number of newspaper editors including members of the group who held meetings last summer to protest against the so-called threat of dictatorship (Tehran despatch 150 of May 14th) as well as Tudeh leaders and minor Tudeh suspects. Police believe that the attempt was to have been the signal for a coup d'etat and a widespread revolutionary movement. 4. Certain deputies have apparently stated that the attempt was a plant organised by the general staff in order to justify the taking of military measures. It is thought likely that if they continue to express such views their parliamentary immunity may be suspended, (See my immediately following telegram).

Your telegram No. 96 [of Ist-f. February: Publicity for British interests in Persia.] Your proposal has been discussed with the Bank and Oil Company with the suggestion that, if they approved, they should make arrangements themselves for suitable notions . to appear in the London Press. Kennet entirely approves but the Oil Company while welcoming more publicity in general, think that a sudden flare-up of critical articles in London will appear to have been engineered by them, and will have adverse effects on their own negotiations They were willing to consider a suggestion that all publicity should be linked to recent agency messages reporting student demonstrations in Tehran, but wished first to obtain Gass's opinion. 2. If Gass has arrived, please discuss with him urgently and telegraph whether.you think we should still pursue this subject. We should also like to know whether your views have been modified by the attempted assassination and the declaration of martial law. 3.

You may of course give him a suitable message of congratulation from me in advance of something more formal. If he is unable to attend to business for the present, you should make the points in paragraphs 3 and 4 below to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Prime Minister if available. 2. I think it would be unwise to suggest to him that unless there is a complete change in the attitude of the Persian Government His Majesty's Government must review their policy towards Persia. What seems to be happening is that the Persian Government are allowing themselves to be driven by the campaign in press and Parliament against the Bank and the Oil Company into less reasonable behaviour towards them. What is needed is not a change of attitude but a stiffening, an attempt to lead public opinion instead of being led by it. Until a week ago we had no reason to complain of Golshayan's actions while Hikmat's^interventions were usually successful. I should like to bring them back to their former frame of mind. 3. You should therefore say that His Majesty's Government are surprised at the volume of hostile criticism of the Oil Company and the Bank that has sprung up recently, that these are the two most important British interests in Persia and that His Majesty’s Government would take it exceedingly ill if they were treated unfairly. You should go on to impress upon him the importance of these concerns both to the United Kingdom and to Persia, on the lines of paragraph 2— XaQNMPMTIAL .
