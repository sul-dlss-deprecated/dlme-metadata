Governor-General has drawn up certain demands as condition of retaining office and presented them to the Persian Government. They include :— 1. That Soulet should be ordered to co-operate in the maintenance of order, in default of which he should be dismissed as chief of his tribe. 2. That Governor-General should be empowered to employ the entire revenue of province of Pars for the period of one year to satisfy pressing local needs, but, above all, to organise necessary force of troops. No. 2. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 14.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 14, 1909. MINISTER for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance visited two legations yesterday, and applied for an advance from two Governments of 500,000L urgently needed by Persian Government. We promised to telegraph this application to our Governments. We both endeavoured to elicit views of Persian Government as to security for advance, employment of money, control of expenditure, and the engagement of foreign agents, but we found Ministers as yet unable to state their views with more precision and in greater detail than as follows :— Persian Government offer at present no security. They hope for a considerable loan later for consolidation at low interest of the floating debt, which would reduce charges on custom-house, thus enabling them to provide for necessary security. Ministers stated that money was to be used for restoration of order, for which formation of an army and gendarmerie was needed, and for reforms, especially financial. They said they were preparing and would communicate to the two legations a detailed programme of expenditure, and also scheme of control, of which we could gather no clear idea except that M. Bizot was to be given more influence than heretofore, and was to superintend its execution. If foreign advisers were found necessary they would be engaged, the Medjliss having approved their employment in principle, but as regards finances they wished for the present to try how far changes in Persian staff and the employment of enlightened persons would suffice to effect necessary reforms. This is not very encouraging, but I trust two Governments will not refuse to discuss an advance. For the first time there seem to be indications that I ersian Government is sincerely trying to prepare a sensible budget and a scheme for control.9 No. 3. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 15, 1909. HIS Majesty’s consul at Shiraz telegraphs as follows: “The Boir Ahmadis, a branch of the Kuhgeluis, have for some days held the Bushire road about 40 miles outside Shiraz; all communication is interrupted. Caravans have collected at Dastarjin, and tribesmen threaten to raid them. “ As conditions for the restoration of order Soulet-ed-Dowleh at Kazerun demands that the entire road in Fars should be placed under his control, that he should be given the governorship of several districts bordering on it, independent of Saham-ed-Dowleh. To grant these demands would involve the resignation of Saham and Karguzar, and renewed disturbances among Khamseh tribesmen, to refuse them the probable continuance of disorder on the Ispahan and Bushire roads, which will make it impossible for my Russian colleague to proceed to Bushire.” No. 4. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 16, 1909. PROPOSED advance to Persian Government. Provided that conditions are satisfactory and proper security can be obtained, the Imperial Government and the Government of India are prepared to make a joint advance. This advance would amount to 200,000b No. 5. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 17.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, December 13, 1909. I HAVE the honour to report that the following official communique respecting the situation at Ardebil is published this morning:— “ Immediately upon the arrival of the first echelon of the Russian column at the Persian town of Ardebil, which was dispatched there for the defence of the Russian consulate and the Russian subjects resident there, the Karadaghis and Shahsevans (who had previous to this taken possession of the above-named town and plundered it) forthwith left this locality and dispersed to their distant encampments. Since then order has been restored in Ardebil and its environs, and only on the big caravan route connecting the coastal town of Astara with the town of Tabreez are isolated cases of pillaging noticeable. “ Considering, in view of such a position of affairs, that the further presence in Ardebil of a strong detachment is no longer necessary, the Russian Government has decided to recall the greater part of the troops sent there, leaving within the Ardebil district five companies pf infantry, a mountain battery, three sotnias of Cossacks, and a section of engineers, in order, by the help of this force, to guard the consulate and Russian subjects against any eventualities, and to establish free movement for the trading caravans along the Astara-Tabreez route. Of the above-named detachments three companies of infantry, the mountain battery, a sotnia of Cossacks, and the section of engineers will be quartered at Ardebil, one squadron of Cossacks and a company of infantry will guard a portion of the above-mentioned route from Astara to Ardebil, and three squadrons of Cossacks and a company of infantry the road from Ardebil to Saiab, from which point up to the town of Tabreez the route will be guarded by portions of the Tabreez detachment. “As regards the losses incurred by Russian subjects through the pillagino- 0 f Ardebil by the nomadic tribes, responsibility for them will be laid on the^Shali’s Government, which is fomning detachments for an expedition against the Karadaghis and the Shahsevans for the purpose of collecting from them the losses referred toMoreover, the Persian Government has been warned that if its forces do not carry ont the task entrusted to them and Russian subjects do not receive the satisfaction due to them, then the Russian Government will itself take coercive measures with reference to these nomads when it shall deem it expedient.” I have, &amp;c.

However small the security, it is absolutely necessary that some should be offered. If the Russian Government will contribute 200,000b, we are prepared to advance the same sum, but at present we cannot give more. No. 7. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Deceived December 20.) Sir, Tehran, November 21, 1909. AS I had the honour to report in my telegram of the 15th instant,* the Persian Parliament was officially opened on that day by His Majesty the Shah. The diplomatic body having received invitations to attend in uniform, I was present at the ceremony with my colleagues and our respective staffs. His Majesty stood on a raised platform with the Regent on his right and the Yaliahd on his left, while behind were the clergy, including Seyyid Abdullah, the Mujtehed, who took so prominent a part in the Nationalist movement two years ago and has recently returned from exile. The proceedings were marked by conspicuous good order. The speech from the throne was read by the Prime Minister, Sipahdar-i-Azam; and the Shah having with drawn, the ceremony ended. The number of deputies present was just over the necessary quorum of sixty-one, the most prominent of whom are the following :— Tehran Azerbaijan ... Ispahan Astrabad Ghilan Irak ... Kazvin Pars Sani-ed-Dowleh. Vosouk-ed-Dowleh. Haji Seyyid Nasrullah. Zoka-ul-Mulk. Sadik Hesret. Motamin- ul-Mul k. Hussein Kuli Khan, Nawab. Prince Assadullah Mirza. Wahid-ul-Mulk. Taki Zade. Hakim- ul- Mulk. Mustashar-ed -Do wleh. Haji Mirza Reza Khan. Mirza Ibrahim Khan Mushir-ed-Dowleh Dr. Ismail Khan. Moazed-es- Saltaneh. Mom taz-ed-Do wleh. Fahim-ul-Mulk. Amid-ul-Hokema. In order to verify the mandates of the deputies, a provisional president, Motamin-ul-Mulk, and two vice-presidents, were elected on the 16th instant. The result of the examination of mandates was the rejection of five candidates, who, it See “Persia, No. 1 (1910),” No. 205. B 2was found, had not been elected strictly in accordance with the provisions ot the On the 20th instant a permanent president and other officials were elected, the result being as follows :— President. —Mustashar-ed-Dowleh. First Vice-President. —Hap Seyyid Nasrullah. Second Vice-President. —Momtaz-ed-Dowleh. So far the Assembly has been occupied in dealing with formalities relating to its own internal affairs, and beyond the reading of a few congratulatory telegrams including messages from the President of the United States and the French President, from the Austrian, Belgian, and French Governments, and communicating telegrams from Astara respecting the situation at Ardebil—no public business has yet been transacted. I have, &amp;c. G. BABCLAY. No. 8. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 20.) Sir, Tehran, November 29, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from the British acting consul-general at Tabreez respecting the recent movement of rebellious tribes at Ardebil. I have, &amp;c. G. BABCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 8. Acting Consul-General Smart to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Tabreez, November 14, 1909. WITH reference to my telegram of the 12th ultimo, # I have the honour to enclose herewith translations of the two telegrams sent by Bahim Khan and the Karadagh and Shahsevan chiefs respectively to the ex-Shah and to the two Bakhtiari chiefs Amir Mufakham and Sardar-i-Jang. I will not trouble you with a repetition of the events which led up to the capture and sack of Ardebil by the rebels. On the arrival of the Bussian troops, the rebels put up a certain Ghaffar Khan as governor and retired outside the town to the camp, formerly prepared by Sattar Khan. The Shahsevans are now negotiating with Beshid- ul-Mulk, and perhaps the display of force made by the governor-general and the approach of winter may conduce to effect an agreement. At Sarah, where Samad Khan and Bagher Khan now are, there appear to be about 3,000 men under the supreme command of Beshid-ul-Mulk. A detachment is at Astara and another detachment has fortified the Besht road in Khalkhal. This last detachment has already had a skirmish with the Shahsevans, whom they are reported to have repulsed with bombs in the time-honoured revolutionary manner. If peace is made and the rebels retire, Beshid-ul-Mulk will proceed as governor to Ardebil. 1 he Persian Government must make a big effort if they wish to save Azerbaijan. After three months long delay, 200 Persian Cossacks and 200 useless Inanloo horsemen stiuggleinto labreez. It is hopeless to expect the Governor-General to govern the most turbulent province of Persia with such a force. Azerbaijan contains probably the best fighting tribesmen of Persia, and its security is also endangered by the fedais, who exist here in greater numbers than anywhere else. Under such circumstances the problem before the Governor of Azerbaijan is probably more difficult than that con- lontmg any othei piovmcial governor. Ihe severity of the Azerbaijan winter may keep the unruly elements quiet for the next few months; but unless an efficient force, * See “Persia No, 1 (1910),” No. 239.sent from outside and containing no fedais, is organised during this breathing space, the spring may witness a general outbreak of disorders throughout the province. I have, &amp;c. W. A. SMART. Enclosure 2 in No. 8. Telegram addressed to ex-Shah by Bahim Khan and various Chiefs. FOR some time these constitutionalists have created disorders, murdered and plundered. Firstly, how many of the notables and seyyids of Tahreez have they not killed and plundered their houses ! Also at Ardebil they have killed several notables and seyyids, and carried off all their property. And in Tehran they have killed several notables and mujteheds, who are the representatives of the Imam. Having united with Georgians and Armenians, they have killed our ulema and sejyids. If they had any religion, what fault had the ulema and seyyids in their eyes ? Their whole thought is to ruin us and to annihilate the Mahommedan religion and our honour, Therefore, more than 2,000,000 people, and all the khans of Karadagh, and all the begzadehs and chiefs of the Kujubeglu, and the kathodas of the Shahsevan tribe, have unanimously agreed to start for Ardebil on the 14th of Ramazan, and as long as we live we will not allow any one to mention anywhere the word “ constitution.” We do not grudge any service for your Majesty, and we offer our lives and property as a sacrifice to your Majesty. The above is for the information of your Imperial Majesty. (Signatures of Rahim Khan and nine Karadagh and Shahsevan Chiefs.) Enclosure 3 in No. 8. Telegram addressed to Amir Mufakham and Sardar-i-Jang by Bahim Khan and various Chiefs. FOR some time past these constitutionalists have created disorders, murdered, and plundered. How many ulema and seyyids of Tabreez and other places^ have they not killed. From the beginning their intention has not been constitutionalism, but rather the destruction of the religion of Mahomet. Therefore, all the khans and chiefs^ of Karadagh, and the khans, begzadehs, and kathodas of the Shahsevans, having assembled, have agreed to start for Ardebil on the 14th of Ramazan, in order to destroy the constitutionalists there. Thence we will march on Tehran. Haying marched straight there, as long as we have life, we will not allow the name of constitutionalism to exist in Persia. The above is for your information. (Signatures of Rahim Khan and nine Karadagh and Shahsevan Chiefs.) No. 9. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived December 20.) g- r Tehran, November 30, 1909. IT was generally believed that when the Medjliss met a determined attack would be made on the Ministry by the advanced Nationalists. _ That this opinion has not proved correct is probably due to the counsels of moderation of Nasr-ul-Mulk, who since his return has used all his powerful influence to persuade the advanced Nationalists not to upset the present Cabinet. I believe that on his arrival he was urged to accept the post of Regent, but that he probably refused in the conviction that he could do more useful work for the moment if he held no office and confined himself to giving disinterested The main southern route—the Bushire-Ispahan road—is again reported practically closed, the section between Shiraz and Kazerun, on which the Russian consul-general at Bushire was recently attacked, and the stages immediately south of Ispahan, where the road is completely blocked by the Kuhgeluis, being especially disturbed. Disturbances [716J B 6are again threatening at Shiraz, where the Governor-Gen era!, able man though he is, is finding great difficulty in maintaining his authority with the small force at his disposal. The British acting consul regards the situation in Ears as critical, and urges that the governor should receive strong support from Tehran, adding that, should Saham-ed- Dowleh fail, the province would fall into chaos from which the only exit would be intervention. Tribal conflicts, for which the Kalhurs appear to be responsible, are reported from the neighbourhood of Kefmanshah. From Kerman news comes that the Narmashir district is threatened with raids from Baluchis. At Zenjan, where trouble has been brewing for some time, fomented by a reactionary mullah, there has been fighting between the mullah’s following and the Government troops, who were on their way to Ardebil. Fortunately the latter were entirely successful, the mullah and his leading supporters being captured, but notwithstanding this success, and despite the deliverance of Ardebil by the arrival of Russian troops, the general situation ^ is, I think, decidedly less hopeful than four weeks ago. Unfortunately the Cabinet’s programme for submission to the Medjliss, which is believed to contain a proposal to apply to the two Governments for a loan, has not yet been placed before the Assembly. The most crying needs for the present are the institution of an efficient gendar merie and the reorganisation of the financial administration. Both are essential before the revenue can again be properly collected and can be properly used. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 10. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 20.)

Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending December 3, 1909. Tehran. THE King’s birthday was celebrated in the usual manner on the 9th instant, when representatives of His Majesty the Shah and the Foreign Office bearing con gratulatory messages were received bv His Majesty’s Minister, who in the evening gave a dinner to the Cabinet Ministers and principal members of the English colony. The ex-Prime Minister, Mushir-es-Sultaneh, and others who were in “bast” at the Turkish Embassy have left their place of refuge and have paid varying sums to the Government, by which means they have apparently avoided molestation for their past reactionary activity. Colonel Prince Yadbolsky, Chief of the Staff of the cavalry division of the Caucasus, arrived at Tehran on the 23rd instant to take command of the Persian Cossack Brigade in succession to Colonel Liakhoff. The National Assembly. —The Medjliss was officially opened by the Shah on the 15th November. The corps diplomatique attended the ceremony in uniform. The speech from the throne was read by Sipahdar-i-Azam, the Minister of War. The first three days were occupied in verifying the mandates of the deputies under the provisional presidency of Motamin-ul-Mulk. On the 20th November Mustashar-ed- Dowleh was elected president, while Haji Seyyid Nasrullah and Momtaz-ed-Dowleh were chosen as vice-presidents. On the 22nd the deputies took the oath prescribed by the constitution, and on the following day Azad-ul-Mulk was confirmed as regent by a vote of the majority. J On the 25th the Regent, Azad-ul-Mulk, took the oath of allegiance to the constitution at a special sitting of the Medjliss in the presence of the principal muiteheds including Seyyid Abdullah, who had lately returned from exile.7 [716] The Regent informed the House of the resignation of Sipahdar and Sardar Assad from their offices of Ministers of Wan and the Interior respectively, but added that he had refused to accept their withdrawal. Their letters to the Regent, formally resigning their offices, were then read and the President proposed that the House should confirm the Regent’s decision not to accept the resignations of the two chiefs, and the proposal was unanimously agreed to without a division. On the 30th November, the Cabinet having in the meantime been reconstructed, the following Ministers were presented to the House by the Premier, Sipahdar-i- Azam :— Sardar Assad Ala-es-Sultaneh Mushir-ed-Dowleh Y osouk-ed-Dowleh Sani-ed-Dowleh Sardar Mansour Minister of the Interior. Minister of Foreign Affairs. Minister of Justice. Minister of Finance. Minister of Education. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The War Office remains under Sipahdar-i-Azam. Yosouk-ed-Dowleh then read the programme of the Cabinet, of which the following are the principal features. 1. Reform of the army, police, and road guards. 2. An immediate advance of 500,000/. and the consolidation of the present floating debt. 3. Financial reform and appointment of inspectors and a central Treasury. 4. Engagement of foreign advisers and reorganisation of all Government departments. Tabreez. No incident of importance has occurred at Tabreez itself during the past four weeks, but the Governor-General has found himself somewhat hampered by Sattar Khan, who returned to Tabreez early in November from Ardebil. One officer and forty-two Russian Cossacks were on the 2nd November sent to Sarah as the Russian consular agent at that place reported that it was threatened by rebels. Thirty of the detachment were to return if the officer considered twelve sufficient to protect the few Russians at Sarah. Ardebil. At the beginning of November Sattar Khan, who had been surrounded in Ardebil by Rahim Khan with Karadaghis and Shahsevans, escaped with a few men to Sarah. The Russian vice-consul at Ardebil telegraphed to the Russian consul-general at Tabreez that the town was on the point of falling, that^ the Government i° rc ®® h ac ‘- no more ammunition and had begged him to bring in Russian troops, that he could not he responsible for the safety of Russian subjects, and that he feared an attack on the vice-consulate by the terrified mob. On the 5th November His Majesty s acting consul-general at Tabreez reported that Ardebil had been takep and plundeied , t ie local authorities and some others had taken refuge in the Russian viee-consula e, an the rebels were demanding their surrender. The Russian vice-consul asked or immediate help. The Russian Government had meanwhile determined to reiniorce their consular guard at Ardebil, and were discussing the question of sending a considerable force. By the 11th November a Russian battalion was on its way to Ardebil from Astara with orders to keep the road open and to take action against caravans carrying loot and against depots of loot. A regiment was also at As ara ready to move if required. On the 16th November Russian officia s a ane -z stated that at least two battalions and 200 Cossacks had arrived at Ardebii. On the 17th November the Russian vice-consul reported that after two days negotiations, Rahim Khan and his men had evacuated Ardebil, a religious service of tha n s- fbving for deliverance had been held at which Armenian priests and Moslem mu as officiated, and later the Russian troops had been reviewed On the November Mr. Smart reported that Rahim Khan had gone to Karadagh and the Shahse to Moghan their winter quarters. On the 30th November M. Poklewsky announced thafit had been decidedto withdraw the greater part of the troops from Ardebffi Reshid-ul-Mulk had meanwhile reached Ardebil and assumed the governorship, and some Government troops had also arrived theie.8 Zinjan, A force of Government troops under Yprim and Sardar Bahadur arrived from Tehran on the 16th November on their way to Ardebil, but finding Mullah Kurban Ali and others still in revolt against the Government they attacked them. Some fighting occurred, but the rebels were soon scattered, and by the end of November all the leaders had been captured and order restored. On the 1st December the force was still at Zinjan. Besht. The town and district have remained quiet. Amid-es-Sultan, with 250 Government troops, left on the 2nd November for Ardebil. Ispahan. Samsam-es-Sultaneh retains the governorship, and the town remains fairly quiet. The Tehran road continues undisturbed, and the Yezd road has practically been so, though one caravan was plundered. Persian reports describe the Sultanabad road as quite unsafe. The Shiraz road near Yezdikhast has remained in the hands of some 300 Kuhgelui tribesmen, who have plundered several caravans and posts. The Persian Cossacks on their way to Shiraz managed to get through during the temporary absence of the tribesmen. Insurance companies refuse to insure caravans using the Shiraz road, and the rate of transport is double that of last year. The Governor-General of Ispahan refuses to guarantee the safety of a specie caravan in his district. There was a temporary improvement, but about the 20th November a serious robbery was committed by Kuhgeluis at Orchini, within 10 miles of Ispahan, on the Shiraz road, when the post was entirely looted, and a caravan of 300 animals carried off. The robbers are reported to be holding a position commanding the road and barring traffic. Yezd. The new governor has maintained order, punished many offenders, and dispatched a force to deal with the Tafti roughs. Many of the latter are now in hiding. On the whole, Yezd is a more peaceful spot than it has been for a long time. The roads are much safer, but one post was robbed near No-Gumbaz early in the month. Sultanabad. The outlook m Irak is, according to Mr. Yice-Consul Strauss, very unsatis factory. A leading priest took refuge in the vice-consulate, averring that the governor sought to kill him, but was eventually persuaded to leave. Many of the wealthier inhabitants of the town have left or are leaving for Kerbela and other places. Kermanshah. Um-ul-Khakan, mother of the ex-Shah, died at Kasr-i-Shirin on the 1st November on her way to Kerbela. About the 8th November a fight took place between Daoud Khan, supported by most of the tribes in the Kermanshah district, and the Sinjabis, allied with the Jafts of Kurdistan and the Ahmed wand Chelabis (Turkish refugees). The o-overnor received orders to support Daoud Khan, but as a party in Kermanshah was opposed to further fighting as likely to lead to a religious war, the Jaffs being Sunnis, be delayed some days before sending troops. When the troops were sent the Siniabis retired^ as they did not wish to fight Government troops. Daoud Khan thereupon plundered several tillages. The roads are unsafe and the country around Hamadan is reported disturbed and traffic practically stopped. ^ by th T egovemor and diStri0t ^ remained ( l uiet thanks to the strong measures taken r&gt;„i 4 . tele £ ram dated the 29th November from Kerman stated that the Sarhad Baluchis were gathering apparently with the intention of raiding the Narmashir district. His Majesty s Minister having urged the Persian Government to take steps to prevent this, troops are being dispatched from Seistan and Kerman to Bamnur whence it is hoped they will be able to control the Baluchis P ’9 Shiraz. The roads are going from bad to worse. The post from Bushire was robbed near Kazerun, two parcels belonging to His Majesty’s consul being carried off, apparently by Kashgais. The post from Tehran was robbed near Yezdikhast, and a caravan of seventy mules, accompanied by Arbab Bustam, was carried off near Khaneb Kirghan. The Arbab came on almost alone. On the 16th a similar robbery was reported from the Sineh Safid pass, ne&lt;*r Dastarjin, the robbers in both cases being Kuhgeluis; but it is inconceivable that they acted without Kashgai connivance. M. Passek, Bussian consul-general, arrived on the 15th. Mansur-es-Saltaneh, Arab, has been appointed Governor of Dashti and Dashtistan. He was to have accompanied Mr. Bill as far as Borasjun, but his departure is now dependent, like everything else, on the fate of the governor. _ On the 24th November a large caravan, which was accompanied by M. Bassek, consul-general, and M. Kadbulowsky, secretary, of ttm Bussian^ consulate-geneial at Bushire, was attacked by tribesmen, said to be Boir-Ahmadis, a section of the Kuhgeluis. Of the escort of two Bussian Cossacks, one was killed and the other wounded. Two Persian Cossacks were wounded and ten or twelve other Persians with the caravan were killed. The attack took place at the Karagatch bridge between Khan-i-Zinian and Dasht-i-Arjin. The Russian officials returned to the former place to which His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz with Dr. Woollat, the telegraph doctor at once rode out with an escort. This portion of the Bushire road has been disturbed throughout November, the trouble being attributed to the Kashgais, though whether with the approval of Soulet-ed-Dowleh or not is not known. The telegraph line has been persistently interfered with by Kasbgais, who also detained and beat a signa ler whom they met on the road. The Boir-Ahmadis have also been active on the 4 ars- Ispahan border, plundering caravans and in one instance killing five men. 1 eir country is under the Governor of Behbehan. The latter district has been late y separated from Pars and entrusted to the Bakhtiaris. Nothing short of a strong expedition is likely to bring the Boir- Ahmadis into order._ Between Dehbffi and Shiraz and in the latter town itself the Governor-General’s prestige has so far sufficed to keep order, but failing support in troops or in money wherewith to raise troops it is unlikely that he will be able to maintain order. He is in any case powerless to punish tribesmen who commit outrages such as that on the Bussian officials. His Majesty s Minister has strongly urged the Central Government to send immediate support to the Governor- General C The latter has incurred some unpopularity by restricting the sale of opium. A riot occurred in Shiraz on the 28th November. It was soon over, but Mx. Bill was inclined to regard the situation in a serious light as the Governor-General had no means of enforcing his authority and if he resigned there was no one to replace him. Peksian Gulf. Bushire. Twelve members, instead of six, having been elected irregularly to the local assembly, the Minister of the Interior has ordered a fresh election S1X members. The assembly, 1 laving failed to elect a member to the National Assembly, has been requested by the Minister of the Interior to elect one of twenty men residing at Tehran, whose names have been telegraphed to it , „ ^ ^ The Governor-General of Pars having at the end of October declared that he would not be responsible for the safety of the Firuzabad route caravans began to use the Kazerun road. Had the latter been placed in charge of He Kashgais, all m g have been well, but as it was entrusted to their enemies the Kawamrs, the Kashgais at once began to molest caravans. In addition to this, the^ khans of Haliki ant Borasiun are exacting blackmail under the name of “ road tax at an exorbitant i , and also compel muleteers to buy forage at double the proper price.

Smugg eis ar taking full advantage of the opportunity thus afforded them. Lingah. The report that Bastek had been taken proved correct but its seizure on the 29th September, was in no way connected with Seyyid Abdul Hussein, Lari. It appea10 that the Deputy Governor of Bastek, Soulat-ul-Mulk, being very unpopular, the people invited his enemy, Ghulam Hussein Khan, Yeravi, to come and turn him out. This the latter did without resistance, and he made the people pay somewhat heavily for his assistance. Latest reports are to the effect that he has left the town, leaving a deputy to govern it. The news of events at Bastek caused considerable alarm at Lingah, and many British subjects actually embarked for Bombay. His Majesty’s consul at Bunder Abbas went to Lingah to report on the situation, and found that the alarm was exaggerated. Lingah has now assumed its normal condition. No. 11. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 1.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 1, 1910. IN continuation of my telegram of the 15th December, 1 have the honour to report that I have received from the British acting consul at Shiraz an able and comprehensive despatch dealing with the situation created on the Ispahan-Bushire road by the recent depredations of the Boir-Ahmadi tribesmen. This tribe, thanks to its successful operations, and above all to its recent attack on M. Passek, has gained far-reaching prestige and a formidable power, and Mr. Bill is of opinion that its punishment is urgently demanded. He believes that the only Persian troops capable of undertaking such measures would be a joint force of Kashgais and Bakhtiaris, a combination which seems thwarted b}' the jealousy of the two chiefs, so tha.t the time when mere abstention on our part will fail to meet the pressing necessities of the case cannot of necessity be far distant, if it is not already at hand. He advocates the punishment of the tribe by a British expedition. Although deprecating such a step at the present moment, it is hard to avoid the conviction that we shall be forced at no distant date to consider the necessity of depart ing from our policy as formulated in your telegram to Sir A.

It is impossible indefinitely to tolerate the present state of things, which is so serious that the Russian consul-general is unable to proceed on his journey from Shiraz to Bush ire. _ It is clear that Mr. Bill does not believe that Persian Government are able to punish these outlaws. Be that as it may, prompt financial help can alone give them a chance of restoring order, and as the defeat of Rahim Khan’s force in the north, reported yesterday, will naturally add to Government’s prestige, the present moment is especially opportune for the granting of an advance. The severe cold has lartely forced the tribesmen to abandon the road, but this improvement cannot necessarily be lasting. No. 12. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 6.) (Telegraphic.) _ St. Petersburgh, January 6, 1910. I HAVE received a memorandum from Russian Government in regard to the proposed advance. They do not refuse in principle to participate in an advance though they are convinced that an advance of even 400,000b will not lead to an effective improve- ment of the situation, and will be speedily exhausted. They consider that an advance should be made m close connection with a more considerable loan, as the latter can alone provide necessary funds for the introduction of urgent reforms and for extinction or conversion of floating debts, which are so burdensome to the Persian Treasury furthermore, Russian Government draws attention to the fact that it will only be by means of negotiating a large loan that Russia and England will be in a position^to insist on the institution of an effective financial control. . A c C ? n ‘ r ? 1 of ex Penditure of advance is indispensable, and they think control should be confided to a special financial commission. * See “ Persia No. 2 (1909),” No. 70.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 8, 1910. SIR A. NICOLSON’S telegram of the 6th January. It is of course impossible to assert that financial assistance will put Persian Government in a position to restore normal conditions, but the chance of success at any rate justifies a trial, and, in my opinion, promptitude in granting the advance rather than the magnitude of the sum given is the important factor upon which success depends. The authority of the Persian Government would be greatly strengthened in the provinces by the mere fact that the two Governments were assisting them in this crisis. No. 14. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 17, 1910.) (Extract.) Tehran, December 27, 1909. ON the 30th ultimo the Ministerial programme, of which I transmit a summary, was presented to the Medjliss, and, after being discussed in secret session, was foimally approved, the two items on which the best chance of success depends the borrowing of 500,000Z. and the engagement of foreign advisers—being accepted only subject to the eventual approval by the Medjliss of the conditions attached to the advance and of the terms on which foreign advisers are to be engaged. On the 12th instant the Minister for Foreign Affairs called privately at the two legations to give us notice that the application for the advance would be made on the following day, and to uige upon my colleague and me the pressing need of the I ersiaiy Government. ^ On the following day his Highness called again, this time accompanied by the Minister of Finance, and formally applied for the advance, which the two Ministers declared to be imperatively needed for the restoration of order and for reforms in the administration, especially in the Department of Finance. . &lt; . . Since the application for the advance things have marked time m lehran; the Cabinet is anxiously awaiting to learn the conditions which the two Poweis decide to attach to the advance, and loses no opportunity of impressing upon my colleague and me that its resignation will follow a breakdown of the negotiations. As regards the state of public order in the provinces during the past four weeks, the only event of any importance reported has been a fight near Sarah a day or two ago between a son of Rahim Khan and some of the Government force sent from Tehran. Sardar Assad’s son commanded the Government troops, and the light is said to have resulted in the complete defeat of Rahim Khan s men. The state of the Bushire-Ispahan road was up to the last few days, if anything, worse than when last I wrote, but I learn this morning that a few caravans are passing now between Kazerun and Shiraz, the Boir Ahmadi tribesmen having been compelled by the severe cold to abandon their encampments, and that the road between Ispahan and Yezdikhast is no longer blocked by Kuhgeluis. Latest advices also denote some improvement on the Kermanshah-Hamadan road. Enclosure in No. 14. Precis of Ministerial Programme submitted by the Persian Cabinet to the National Assembly, November 30, 1909. (Translation.) . „ „ AFTER a lengthy preamble respecting the urgent necessity lor reforms, the programme states that the main object which the Government must keep m view is the maintenance of order in the country. For this purpose it is necessary (1.) To maintain a well-organised force, and to station it permanently in different parts of the country; . , , , t (2.) To employ regular road-guards for the protection ol trade routes ; and (3.) To organise an efficient police force in all the towns. Military reforms will require careful consideration, and, when completed, the scheme will be laid before Parliament. As a temporary measure for the maintenance12 of order, the Government propose to have between 25,000 and 30,000 of the existing soldiers under arms. The budget for this force will be submitted to Parliament for approval. To carry on the Government a sum of 2,500,000 tomans (500,000L) is necessary at once, and as this sum is difficult to obtain in the country at this moment, it is proposed that a fresh loan should be raised. In view of the importance of maintaining order throughout the country, it is proposed by the Government to open negotiations without delay for the purpose of obtaining an advance of the above-mentioned sum, and subsequently to negotiate respecting a larger loan for the purpose of consolidating the different advances made to the Government at high interest. The interest paid by the State on the loan will naturally be at a lower rate than that now borne by the advances, and thus a new source will be found for the payment of interest and sinking fund on the amount to be borrowed. The result of the negotiations for the loan will in due course be submitted to Parliament: The most important reforms which the Government will have to undertake will be the introduction of a system of control for the revenue and expenditure of the State, which is as important as the maintenance of order. At the same time as the financial reforms are introduced it will be necessary to establish an accounts department and a system for the collection of all the revenue in the capital, and the formation of a treasury department. The budget for each department will have to be fixed and presented to Parliament, but before undertaking these budgets, and putting them into execution, those which were in force when the present Government took office will hold good. It will further be necessary to reorganise the various departments of the Govern ment on modern lines, and for this purpose it is proposed to introduce foreign advisers in order that a proper reform should be assured. The Administrations of Justice and Education are particularly in need of reform, and the work of reforming the Administration of Justice is already in hand. New laws will be submitted to Parliament, but until this is done the present system will continue in force, and the Minister of Justice will be authorised to select his own subordinates. A Bill for educational reform wall be submitted to Parliament, and will include provision for the expense of sending students to Europe. No. 15. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 17, 1910.) Tehran, December 27, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul- general at Meshed reporting the judicial murder at Nishapur of two Ismailis at the instigation of the clergy. I have pointed out to the Persian Government the deplorable impression that would be produced in England, where the Ismailis, owing to the position of the Aga Khan as a British subject, are the object of very special interest, and I have urged the necessity of punishing the culprits and of dismissing the Governors of Darud and Nishapur, the latter of whom appears to have shown culpable weakness, and the former having been practically an accomplice in the outrages. Sardar Assad to whom my representations were made, seemed to realise how important it was that an example should be made of the fanatics responsible for these crimes, and promised to punish the two culprits, who have been brought to Tehran for trial. He told me however, that the Persian Government did not feel strong enough to execute two Mollahs without the sanction of the Ulema at Nejef, for which he had already asked, but he promised to dismiss the two governors, and if the Ulema refused to sanction the execution of the two culprits, to imprison for life Bagher Darrudi who actually committed the murders, and to deport Moin-ul-Ghuruba, the instigator of the crimes, bo JjLerDelci.13 it for &gt;osei ttder Enclosure in No. 15. Consul-General Sykes to Sir G. Barclay. gj r December 7, 1909. I HAVE the honour to report that Mohammad Khan, the munshi _ of this consulate-general, and a man of high character, has returned from enquiring into the very serious outrages perpetrated on the Ismailis, and what he states fully confirms, and also supplements, information received by me from various sources. Consequently my facts are substantially correct. ^ _ 2. It is hardly necessary to state for your information that the Ismaihs are followers of his Highness Aga Khan, who is the leading Mahommedan in India, In Persia they are scattered about in small, poverty-stricken communities, mainly m the Kainat (Sehdeh) and Nishapur districts, and during my long connection with Persia no such outrages have occurred, and it has been under a reformed and so-called enlightened Government that these poor men have been outraged, done to death, and then treated with unmentionable indignities. Indeed, their bodies were still unbuned a few ^ 3^The instigator of the whole business is apparently a certain Mollah Abdul Karim who was an Ismaili, hut became a convert to Shia doctrines. He pointed out to the Moin-ul-Ghuruba, a minor mujtehed of Meshed and an ardent Constitutionalist, that there was certain property in charge of Mollah Suliman from which tithes were paid to his Highness the Aga Khan, and suggested the murder of this individual and the seizure of the property, which they would divide. Last October the Mom-u - Ghuruba sent for Mollah Suliman and other Ismailis to Meshed where an enquiry was held as to their dogma. This step was followed by the Mom-ul-Ghuruba proceeding to Dizhad, some 20 miles east of Nishapur, where he was joined by Hap Mohammad Bakir Durrudi, and also by Mohammad Husain Khan, the Governor of Darrud. worthies tortured the Ismailis and destroyed their mosque. They then proceeded to Kasimabad where they acted in a similar fashion. Hearing of this, I obtained a strong letter from the leading mujtehed, known as the Agazada, which was sent to and received by the Moin-ul-Ghuruba. I also wrote a strong letter to the Khazm-ui-Mulk, Governor of Nishapur, who replied that he had settled the matter. 4. Mollah Suliman, Mollah Husain Ali, and three other leading Ismaihs were taken to Darrud where they were sentenced to death ; also the chief priest, tiaqi Aknund, who is safe in the British consulate-general, was condemned to death m his absence. After this the Governor of Darrud and Haji Mohammad Bakir Durrudi went to Nishapur and reported the matter to the governor and to Sheikh Aga, the leading muitehed. The latter, however, refused to have anything to do with the case, i e Khazin-ul-Mulk was asked to send his executioner, hut refused to do so Ibis is corroborated by the new chief of police, who pointed out to the governor what a serious position he was in. Indeed, what can be thought of a governor who, knowing what was happening, refused to act ? There is worse to follow. i , n 5. Haii Mohammad Bakir Durrudi then persuaded the Mom-ul-Ghuruba to alio\v the execution, and the men were murdered by Durrudi and their corpses treated wit r every obscene indignity. The Governor of Nishapur was petitioned by the Ismaihs to be allowed to remove the corpses, hut demanded a large sum of money, w ic was no given. Others of the prisoners who had not escaped had to pay the Governor of Nishanur for their release. , . 1 , -vr- i Ck Subsequently, owing to strong orders from Tehran arid my arrival at Nishapur Haii Mbhammad Bakir was seized and sent to Tehran. T h e Mom-ul-Ghuruba is still at Meshed, but I am exerting much pressure for him to follow. I may add that the Asazada has confirmed the accuracy of the above. , . , 8 7 I think Sir, that apart from the fact that the Ismaihs are connected with us, the dictates of’humanity demand that exemplary punishment be meted out to the two Mollahs and to the Governors of Nishapur and of Darrud This I feel sure that you will insist upon. My Russian colleague and the Persian authorities agree with me that these outrages would never have occurred had Nishapur been under Khorasan by which provmce.it is surrounded, and we are all addressing Tehran to remedy this state of affairs I need hardly refer to the bank case as an instance of the great difficulty of getting the Governo/of Nishapur to act, and I trust both that this individual may be dismissed and that Nishapur may be restored to Khorasan. It was temporardy severed to suit the personal convenience of his Highness the Naur-ed-Dowleh but until this anomaly be done away with it is hopeless to expect any reform in the district,.14 My latest information shows that a reign of terror still exists, and that the Ismailis are being blackmailed and robbed, but this I hope to stop by a telegram to the Governor of Nishapur that will assure them safety until the legation can take decisive action in this case.

The Assembly .—TheMimsterml programme, which was presented to the Medjliss on the 30th November, was formally agreed to at the sitting of the 7th December, when all the Cabinet Ministers attended. The Assembly, however, availed itself of the opportunity to remind the Ministers of their obligation to consult Parliament in all matters of finance. After considerable discussion, the Assembly, on the 15th instant, decided by a vote of the majority to allow the Government mint to make contracts for the mintino- of silver to the value of 400,000h During the past month the Assembly has been chiefly occupied preparing new internal regulations, which were read for the third time on the 28th instant. Financial Difficulties.—The Government applied on the 13th instant to the British and Russian Legations for a joint advance of 500,000h, and is still awaiting a reply. Tabreez. Tabreez has remained undisturbed, but fighting has taken place near Sarat between a force of tribesmen under the son of Rahim Khan and the Governmenl troops under Sardar Assad’s son and Yprim, in which the latter are reported to have been successful.

A report is current that on the 6th November an influential resident of Ravendge, in the Mahallat district, named Aga Sadr, was murdered, as was his twelve-year-old son, by order of the governor. Both were shot in their house by a Caucasian, Mehdi Khan, who was accompanied by Karim Khan, the old enemy of Messrs. Ziegler s murdered agent, Ali Khan, and six of the governor’s escort. Kermanshah. The state of the town is far from satisfactory, robberies being of frequent occurrence, Zahir-ed-Dowleh resigned the governorship at the end of November, and Nizam-es-Sultaneh was appointed in his stead, but has not yet assumed the governorship. The Bagdad road has been fairly safe, but on all other roads numerous robberies are reported. The telegraph line has been repeatedly interrupted, several miles of line having been destroyed, and much material carried away by marauding Kakawend tribesmen. Latest advices, however, show that the roads from Kermanshah are now clear. Hamadan. The Governor of Hamadan was was then reported quiet. dismissed about the 15th December. Kerman, The district The town and district have remained quiet. The governor has organised a force which keeps order and has also recovered a certain amount of goods plundered from caravans. The Baluchis, who were thought to intend raiding the Narmashir district, have made no move. Shiraz. The Governor-General maintains his authority with considerable difficulty, while the attitude of Soulet-ed-Dowleh is defiant. The Central Government has authorised the Governor-General to keep part of the local revenue for the purpose of maintaining order. The roads continue disturbed. Persian Gulf. Bushire. There was some difficulty in securing a satisfactory election for the local assembly. The election was therefore postponed until Darya Begi returned fiom Lmgah. Darya Begi returned on the 18th December. Mohammerah.

In this connection I enclose, for your information, an account given by one of the sufferers of a robbery which was reported in “ Shiraz News ” for the 8th December, 1909, and is very typical of the recent occurrences on the Bushire-Ispahan trade route. It will be observed that in this case, although a single Kashgai is reported to have been present, there ip no suggestion that the Kashgai participated in any force, and the robbers were Boir Ahmadi. There can be no doubt, I think, of the correctness of the statement that only genuine co-operation between the Kashgai and Bakhtiari would avail for the complete subjugation of this marauding tribe, as, unless they were attacked on both sides simultaneously, it would be extremely difficult to corner so active and hardy a race of mountaineers. Of this co-operation there appears to be a very scanty prospect. The Kashgai in general, and their Ilkhani in particular, are intensely jealous of the prominent position in Persia which recent events have given to the Bakhtiari, whom they consider inferior to themselves both in courage and in numbers, and there would be a serious danger of operations, undertaken in common by Kashgai and Bakhtiari, turning into hostilities between them. 3. I venture to suggest that the situation, which is merely the logical development of the gradual collapse of prestige which the last few years have brought upon the central authority, has now reached a point at which it demands the serious attention of foreign Powers interested in Persia. The movement, not merely of legitimate commerce, but even of individual travellers, is now attended with so much danger, in spite of the laudable energy displayed by the present Governor-General, that it is nothing short of a farce to continue to treat with the Persian authorities on the usual assumptions which underlie all intercourse between civilised nations. As an illustration of the present feeling in Pars, I may quote the remark made by a muleteer recently arrived from Bushire to the local agent of Messrs. Ziegler. The latter asked the muleteer to go to the British consulate to give me an account of his experience on the road. “ What is the good of going to the consuls,” was the reply, “ when they cannot even defend themselves ? ” The remark is perfectly justified, seeing that at the present moment the Bussian consul-general is unable to proceed to his head-quarters at Bushire on account of the recent attack upon him, and there is no immediate prospect of his being able to attempt the journey. The same considerations, of course, apply to the withdrawal of the British detachment at Shiraz. While I have very little doubt of their ability, owing solely to the presence of the Maxim gun, to force their way to the coast, I should be very sorry to recommend a movement which could not be carried out without serious risk of loss of life. This position of affairs would be of less importance if it were possible to discern the slightest prospect of an improvement in the essential features of the situation. But of this, as I have already indicated, there is at present no sign whatever. On the contrary, the conditions which have rendered possible the deplorable events of the last few weeks, seem to be about the only thing in Persia which shows unmistakable signs of permanence. 4. The policy of His Majesty’s Government is authoritatively stated on page 43 of the Persia Blue Book No. 2 of 1909, namely, that “His Majesty’s Government are disposed to think that the best course to adopt would be for Great Britain and Russia to stand entirely aloof from the internal affairs of Persia, allowing the existing chaos to endure until whatever element in the country is strongest gains the day. During this interval they would be prepared to face the danger which might be involved to British commercial interests.” In the face of this statement of policy it is with considerable diffidence that I venture to suggest that the time must infallibly come, if it has not come already, when mere abstention will no longer meet the urgent necessities of the case I can only base this suggestion on the fact, which appears to me patent, that the situation cannot get permanently better and must get worse, and that there is no sign that the period of anarchy during which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to face the danger to British commercial interests will reach its anticipated term in the triumph of some definite element in the country. On the contrary, the whole of Persian history is a constantly recurring series of periods of more or less prolonged disorder, frequently lasting for several decades. [ 716 ] 0 25. The form of action which I venture to put forward as the least objectionable is the following:— His Majesty’s Government would notify the Tehran authorities that on account of (a) the extreme danger to foreign subjects whose legitimate avocations compel them to travel from place to place in Persia ; e.g., in 1909 alone, the robbery of Mr. Gentleman in March, Mr. Linton and Mr. Smith in April, Mr. Middleton in June, Messrs. Wright and James in August, and the Russian consul-general in November, every one of which robberies has remained absolutely unpunished ; (b) the evergrowing list of foreign claims for goods robbed on the trade route, which has risen in 1909 in Fars alone from 40,609-3 tomans to 57,063-8 tomans ; (c) the regular increase in the wilful damage account of the Indo-European Telegraph Department which is already about double the last year’s total (1st February, 1908-lst February, 1909), and of yet more importance, the continual danger of assault and robbery run by the telegraph gholams on repairing duty, which has frequently menaced the line with total interruption owing to the natural reluctance of the men to go out, the time has come for the Persian Government to show its ability to establish and maintain order, or to acquiesce in the punishment of the most prominent offenders by a British force, the co-operation of a Persian force, if thought desirable, being welcomed. On the eventual collapse of the Persian effort, if made at all, the landing of a British punitive force would follow. 6. The tribe to be singled out for punishment is in my opinion the Boir Ahmadi Kuhgelu. They have been the most conspicuous marauders of the last year; they have acquired a great reputation, and their condign punishment would produce a corresponding effect among other robber tribes ; their country, in the hinterland of Behbehan, is comparatively accessible from the sea, and a march through it, with the destruction of their towers, and the capture or starvation of their flocks, could be effected without necessarily involving hostilities with any other tribe. It would, how ever, as indicated above, be a difficult matter to corner them, and they would probably move en masse into Bakhtiari or Kashgai territory, or in the direction of Yezd; and I would certainly not suggest their being followed up in either contingency. I believe, though, that their continued presence would be so irksome to the tribe harbouring them that these would readily do for us what they would not do for each other, and compel them to submit, especially if threatened with a British attack. 7. Of course, Persia is a country of kaleidoscopic changes, and it is possible that the next few weeks may produce some unforeseen change for the better; but I have felt it my duty to emphasise the fact that no signs of any such change are to be discerned, and to lay before you what is in my judgment the only possible means of restoring conditions in which British trade and travellers can circulate without serious danger to life and property. I would point out in conclusion that if the necessity of active measures is recognised, the sooner they are undertaken the better, as with each successful robbery the robbers become better armed, better organised and bolder.

The robbersheld the ridge above the road from the tower (“ burj ”) to the spring (Chashma-i-Mervarid). The first shot was fired in front, killing the sowar. The tufangchis, who were also in front, ran away, and the robbers closed in on the rear of the caravan. They carried away the whole of the caravan, and stripped and beat us. They carried away one of my men. They took him to a point called Haft Barm-i-Kudian, 3 farsakhs up stream from the Zinian bridge ; there they tied his hands and left him. They took him along to help with the mules. My personal loss was forty-five mules and two donkeys, with all my clothes, and 100 tomans—all I possessed. The robbers are a section of Boir Ahmadi called Tamuradi. They were enemies of Karim Khan, and as long as he b'ved they inhabited the Bakhtiari country. Since last year they have come east. I heir leader is Koi (Kaid?) Muhammad Ali. They have recently raided Bakhtiari territory with Mullah Kobad, and carried oft 12,000 sheep. Our loads were mainly piecegoods. The Boir Ahmadi sell these mainly in Ardakan and Behbehan. The only way of dealing with them is for the Bakhtiari and Soulet-ed-Dowleb to co-operate. The whole Boir Ahmadi tribe could raise 10,000 men ; few mounted, they are each equal to one Kashgai, and 100 of the other inhabitants of Bars. They have four strong towers, which could not be taken without artillery. One Kashgai was seen in the band of robbers. Principal robbers among Boir Ahmadi are now Ka Zafar, Mullah Ali Panah, Koi Hasal. They have plenty of Martinis, few magazine rifles. Since Karim Khan’s death they have dropped cultivation entirely. They have no settlements. Karim Khan left two sons, 6 or 7 years old. The present titular chief is Snru- kullah, half brother on the mother’s side of Karim Khan. The general idea is that he is only temporary, till Karim Khan’s sons grow up. Q. Would it be possible to punish them by excluding them from their markets ? A. No. Since there has been no Shah and no governor (sic), we are all obliged to keep in with the robbers. Anyone who refused them anything would certainly be killed in the long run. No. 29. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 14.) gq. Tehran, Ja?iuary 26, 1910. DURING the last four weeks there has been nothing in Tehran calling for special record. Our answer to the Government’s application for an advance is still anxiously awaited, and, as far as one can judge, the continuance in office of the present Ministry depends on the nature of our reply. It is largely due to the prestige of the two victorious revolutionary leaders, Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, now respectively Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, that the Government is able to carry on with its insufficient funds, and it is questionable how far a Cabinet of which they do not form a part could maintain such authority as the Central Government now possesses. In the north interest during the period under review has centered in the operations of the Government forces under Yprim and Sardar Bahadur, Sardar Assads son, against Rahim Khan. These have been generally successful, and Rahim Khan is apparently m a bad plight, for he has applied for protection to both the Russian and Turkish consuls- general at Tabreez. Both are said to have refused it, but the Persian Government are very anxious lest the defeated brigand should find his way to one of the foreign con sulates and be admitted to bast. . . . „ The situation in Pars, regarding which I am sending an interesting despatch trom the British acting consul at Shiraz, appears to be at the mercy of Soulet-ed-Dowleh At present all traffic between Shiraz and Bush ire is at a standstill: The Government having failed in an endeavour to induce the chief of the Kashgais to police the mam route, that road is completely blocked, and though Soulet-ed-Dowleh has made an arrangement with the merchants by which he guarantees the safety of the road via Jirreh the refusal of the Governor-General to endorse his guarantee has until now pre vented trade from using this route, traders fearing that the Central Government vvi repudiate liability for losses. The situation may improve for a time owing to the announcement of the appointment of a new governor. Sabam-ed-Dowleh s recall is attributed to complaints from Shiraz of the severity of his administration. Whether this was the real cause or not, the antagonism which has developed between the latter 16] 0 d22 and Soulet-ed-jDowleh has made him an undesirable governor at a moment when the Central Government were unable to support him. There seems some reason to hope that Soulet-ed-Dowleh will co-operate with Tarman Farma for the maintenance of order, instead of doing his best to upset his authority, which was the policy he pursued towards the late Governor-General. Except for Azerbaijan and Fars, there have been no occurrences in the provinces during the last four weeks calling for special mention. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 30. Sir G.

Ai the end o± December^ the Government troops under Yprim and Sardar Bahadur defeated the Karadaghis under Rahim Khan’s son and captured Ahar, Rahim Khan s head-quarters. A few days later the Karadaghis, having been reinforced, returned and attacked Ahar. The Government troops went out into the open and repulsed them, killing 30, and losing 1 killed and 4 wounded. The Karadaghis fled northwards. Januar Y the Karadaghis, under Rahim Khan’s son, once more attacked Ahar, this time in large numbers and from several directions. They were repulsed with heavy loss and fled, being pursued for 8 miles by the Government troops, v 10 os died. Sardar Bahadur was slightly wounded in one foot and had his loise s o under him. This defeat appears to have finally broken the power of Rahim Khan as he has applied to both the Russian and Turkish consulates at Tabreez for protection. Meshed. Quiet has prevailed at Meshed. It is probable that Rukn-ed-Dowleh will retain the governorship. Ispahan, 1 6 5t k Januar y Serdari-Ashjaa, Bakhtiari, notified officially to the Russian Mr p nt f 1 cons . u . ls -g e neral that he had been appointed to officiate as Governor-General. fhk ArVTVP hlm 1 ° * 1 * * * l the , 7th JanUar ^ S P eakin g of the Bakhtiari road, the , de °]ared that he and the other khans intended to do all they could to keep the it in the'LriL 118 H VV LPW’ t0 Set ab ° Ut build!n S P r0 P er caravanserai on l h- o Sai&lt; ^ ^ ^ the y k a d not at first grasped what importance the road kd told 3 ''“f' Tbey , had '“'y been makin S a «al.

Caravans have been using all the roads, and no robberies have been reported since the 21st December. Yezd. _ The town and district has remained quiet, but trade is still dull, merchants fearing to resume operations until certain that the new regime will last. Few caravans are therefore moving, but the roads appear to be fairly safe. The local assembly, owing to the opposition of the priests, refuses to admit a Parsee member as laid down in the constitution. The Parsees are meanwhile wasting their energy in quarrelling among themselves. Sultanabad. From reports received it appears that the Governor of Burujird, Amir Seif-ed-din Mirza, is absolutely powerless. Having no money wherewith to pay his troops, large numbers of them have deserted. The priests are in opposition to him, and any proclamation he issues is at once torn down. The deputies sent by him to govern subdivisions of his governorship have all been compelled to return to Burujird. It is feared that, failing the dispatch of a governor with troops and money, the Lur tribes will ravage the countryside in the spring. Kermanshah. Pending the arrival of the new governor, Nizam-es-Sultaneh, from Tehran, the town became quiet and robberies ceased. The governor arrived on the 5th January, the ex-governor having left on the 2nd January for Tehran. Caravans were leaving by all roads. Kerman. The town and district have remained quiet. There has been an exchange of views between the central Government and the governor as to the best way to deal with the Baluchis. The governor appears to have asked for funds to enable him to move a force against them. To this the Government replied that if he were not prepared to reduce the Baluchis and collect revenue from them, they could find another man who would do it. Kawam-ul-Mulk replied that he would like his resignation to be accepted before the Persian new year, and that the Government did not seem to realise that Baluchistan was now practically independent and divided into three parts under Sardars Said Khan, Bahram Khan, and Jihand. If, however, his request for money was granted, he would do his best to go to Bam and Began and bring the Baluchis to terms. Shiraz. The blocking of the Bushire road for caravan traffic owing to the disagreement between Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the Governor-General, has been the question of the month. The former made extravagant demands as to governorships, in return for which he would guarantee the usual route via Kazerun. His demands being refused, he proposed that a route via Jirreh should be used, he guaranteeing its safety, but owing to the refusal of the Governor-General to accept this guarantee, merchants have refrained from using this route. Meanwhile Saham-ed-Dowleh has been dismissed, and Barman Farma has been appointed Governor-General of Fars. The latter is still at Tehran. No. 31. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 16.) g^ r St. Petersburgh, February 13, 1910. THE following semi-official communique was published in the press yesterday “ Some foreign newspapers have circulated the news that the Bussian Government protect Bahim Khan, who has fled into Bussian territory, and. that they are extending to him special hospitality. This news is an invention. Bahim Khan, who played an active part in contending against the present Government, is regarded by the Bussian [716] 0424 Government as a political offender, and as such, according to the generally recognised international custom, is not liable to extradition. In order to cut off all communication between this refugee and his fellow-tribesmen in Persia, and to prevent on his part any kind of intrigue, he has been directed to move from the frontier and to betake himself to Ekaterinodar.” I have, &amp;c.

Teheran, le 3 (16) fevrier, 1910. (Translation.) IN reply to tbe request addressed to the two legations by the Persian Government on the 13th December last, the British and Russian Governments agree to make an advance of 10,000,000 fr. (400,000b) to the Persian Government on the following conditions:— 1. The programme concerning the employment of the sum advanced shall be submitted for the approval of the two legations. Disbursement will be made, in accordance with that programme, under the control of a commission composed of the Financial Adviser, of the Administrator-General of the Customs, or of their repre sentatives in case of absence, of two members of the Medjliss, and of two Persian officials, and presided over by the Minister of Finance. No disbursement can be made without an order for payment signed by the Minister of Finance, in agreement with the commission, and by the Minister of the department concerned. 2. The programme of expenditure shall not be approved by the legations unless it provides for the engagement of seven French officials with executive powers at the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the proposals contained in the report of the Financial Adviser to the Persian Government. These officials shall act according to instructions which will be drawn up with the help of the Financial Adviser and approved by him. No portion of the advance shall be paid before the Persian Government have addressed an official application to the French Government for the engagement of these officers. 3. The programme shall not be accepted unless it provides for the organisation of a sufficient armed force for the security of the commercial means of communication The Persian Government shall undertake to engage foreign instructors as soon as possible, but no foreign instructor shall be engaged for any armed force without the previous consent of the British and Russian Governments. 4. Persia engages to give no concession for thq construction of railways in Persia before offering the option to the British and Russian Governments. This right of option shall not be exercised in the case of a concession to be granted to a Persian subject for the construction and working of a railway with exclusivelv native capital so long as it is proved to the satisfaction of the British and Russian Governments that the capital is really native. 5. The Tabreez-Julfa Road Company shall receive the concession for navigation on Lake Urumia. * 6. This advance shall constitute the first instalment of the loan, for which the Persian government have applied, should it be agreed to by the British and Russian Governments. In the contrary event, this advance, at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, shall be redeemed m ten equal annual instalments secured on the customs »•»—* &lt;* “* *» ** —.. Tehran, February 3 (16), 1910.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received March 14.) { T^xtiTri.cti) Tehran, February 24, 1910. IN Azerbaijan tire situation lias somewhat cleared with the overthrow of Rahim Khan, but in Tabreez Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan are still a source of anxiety, and the acting British consul-general reports that until these two men are disposed of m ost Europeans would view with alarm the withdrawal of the Russian troops fiom Tabreez. In the Ardebil district, according to the Minister of the Interior, the Shah- sevans have made their submission, and promised to restore the plunder taken during the late rising. t • n i From Ears the news is anything but good. Caravans appear to be using ireely the route via Jirreh from Bushire to Shiraz, but the safety of this road is dependent on the good pleasure of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, at whose dictation the central Government substituted it for the road via Kazerun as the route for the safety of which they would answer. Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s attitude is disquieting. Recent reports state that the tribal chiefs in Ears generally are opposed to the Bakhtiari influence m the present Government, and I have since received a telegram from the British acting* consul- general at Bushire containing indications that trouble is brewing at the hands of Soulet- ed-Dowleh, who may be intending to attack the Bakhtiari influence which has become so powerful since the revolution, and in antagonism to which, Major Trevor says, the Kuhgelu and tribal chiefs are known to be in sympathy with the Kashgai. Whatever mav be Soulet-ed-Dowleh s designs the situation m Fais seems to be a his mercy, and the Persian Government cannot hope, at any rate in their present condition, to subdue him. No. 47. Sir G.

THE British and Russian Legations informed the Persian Government on the 16th instant of the conditions under which the two Governments would be prepared to advance a sum of 400,000Z. jointly. _ •, T The Medjliss .—The Minister of Finance, on the 29th January, submitted to t e Assembly a project with regard to the engagement of seven foreign employes for his Ministry, whose salary should aggregate 57,240 tomans (ll,000L). The mattei was referred to the Finance Committee of the House. _ , ni . On the 5th instant Ala-es-Sultaneh, the Foreign Minister, was interpellated regarding the continued presence of Russian troops in Persia Considerable vehemence wfs displayed by several deputies and the alleged inaction of the Foreign Minister was severely criticised. The replies given by the Foreign Minister and the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs were not considered to be satisfactory, and when the motion waspu the Foreign Minister failed to obtain a vote of confidence This being tantamount to his dismissal by the Assembly, Ala-es-Sultaneh ceased be in office from that day. The same evening the legations were informed that Ala-es- Sultaneh having resigned, the Foreign Ministry would be under the charge of Sakat- ul-Mulk, the Under-Secretary.On the 20th instant the budget presented by the Minister for War for the four months ending the 21st March next was read and approved. A variety of subjects of minor importance relating to purely internal and local affairs were dealt with in the course of the sittings. Tabreez. On the 1st February the Government forces under Yprim, Sardar Bahadur, Samad Khan, and Bagher Khan, which had concentrated at Aher, attacked and defeated the forces of Rahim Khan near that place. Rahim Khan fled and was pursued by the two former commanders. He, however, made good his escape to Russian territory, accompanied by some of his family. Two guns, eight loads of ammunition and Rahim Khan’s prisoners fell into the hands of the pursuing force. The Shahsevan and Karadagh chiefs, including Rahim Khan’s nephew, Kerim Khan, have all made their peace with the Government. Rahim Khan is reported to have taken with him a large amount of plundered merchandise. Resht. Tranquillity has prevailed. The Nationalist volunteers have been disarmed, and 200 men of the Khalaj regiment are now in garrison in the town. Meshed. Quiet has prevailed at Meshed and in Khorassan. It appears that the religious element is organising its forces for a struggle against the new order of things. The Governor-General is, however, working in accord with the Nationalist delegates from Tehran and it seems probable that he will retain office. Turbqt-i-Haidari. Aliek, Salar Khan’s stronghold, was attacked on the 31st December by the Government troops. The commander of the latter was slightly wounded early in the fight whereupon his men immediately withdrew. Salar Khan’s wife and children are prisoners. Ispahan. Quarrels have been frequent among the local authorities. These are apparently due to the clergy, who continue to make efforts to retain their influence. The latest news, however,^ is to the effect that Agha Najafi and his two sons are preparing to leave Ispahan for Kerbela. They wish to place their extensive landed property under foreign protection. On the 5th February fifty or sixty seyyids began forcibly closing the shops in the bazaar and crying out against the Assembly. Bakhtiari guards were sent to reopen the shops and the seyyids were forced to retire. Subsequently it was proclaimed by crier that any one closing his shop would have his goods pillaged and.his life taken. The action of the seyyids was intended as a protest against the chief of police, who had torn up and returned to Agha Najafi a letter calling for the release of a prisoner. On the 17th February a second attempt to close the bazaars was made by a priest who had quarrelled with the police. The shops were again forcibly opened bv the authorities. J . D ul i n g the first half of February all the roads to Ispahan were safe, and posts arrived regularly. The Shiraz road remained undisturbed until the 16th February on which date a robbery was committed at Orchini by forty robbers, said to be Kuhgeluis On this date the whole road from Orchini to Shiraz was stated by the postal officials to be very unsafe. The other roads remain undisturbed. Y ezd. The town has remained quiet; the roads have also been undisturbed, excepting K ™ 'T ’ ° n W1 i C i’ th e ml ddle of February, several robberies were reported The robbers, who are said tube Tutakis, Chaharrahis, Lashanis, and Pakalihis, mxler Fezla i Ganjah, frequent the road between Yezd and Anar. The o-overnor states that he has dispatched forces to clear the road. The governor ° recently said that his present post was altogether too small for him, and thlt he would probably be succeeded m it by one of his nephews m the next two mouths. ^ ^Kermanshah. The new governor, Nizam-es-Snltaneh, arrived on the 8th January with 100 horsemen and 500 infantry. By the end of the month he had been joined by 200 Sinjabi and 50 Nanakali horsemen, while 200 others were being raised locally and drilled. The measures taken by the governors have so far preserved order in the town, but his failure to deal severely with some of the more important disturbers of the peace is likely to diminish the respect for his authority. He is also handicapped by the emptiness of the Treasury. Early in February Salar-i-Masud, the Gurah chief and Governor of Kasr-i-Shirin, was ordered by tbe governor to come to Kermanshah with his regiment and taxes. He replied that, being in charge of the border, he could not comply. The governor repeated his summons, and Salar-i-Masud has since been in consultation with Daoud Khan, Kalhur, “chief of the tribes.” Daoud Khan has ordered the road-guards on the Kasr-i-Shirin road to cease exacting blackmail from caravans. Most of the roads continue safe, but several robberies are reported on the Kangowar- Hamadan road. Hamadan. Sardar-i-Nasir has assumed the governorship. He has not so far displayed much ability, and several robberies have occurred since his arrival. Kerman. The governor, who intended to visit Baluchistan and interview the Baluchi sardars himself, has been compelled to abandon the idea partly because the Central Government were unable to give him the money he asked for, and partly because^ of the danger of disorders occurring in Kerman on his departure. The reappearance of gangs of robbers on the Kerman—Yezd road may also have caused him to remain m Kerman. He has, however, dispatched a representative to interview the sardars. It seems that early m January he received a letter from Sardar Seyyid Khan, saying that as he is head of all the Ears tribes, and the Baluchis know him well, they are quite willing to submit tohiin , but as the Persian Government is powerless, and affairs are in disorder, the Baluchis do not know what to do.

We asked that a reply to our conditions for the joint advance should he made to us.

THREE extra months have been added to the period of contract between the present Financial Adviser and the Persian Government.

Reply of Persian Government adds that they will always respect entirely any arrangements made between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government as regards any sources of the country’s revenues. My Russian colleague has received a similar communication that has one addition, however, viz., that with regard to the passage respecting the loan veto, the Persian Government will observe all obligations in the loan contracts with the Russian Government. These notes are unsatisfactory, and we propose to reply that customs revenue and other sources of revenue affected to service of loans concluded in Russia and in England cannot in any case serve as securities for new loans ; secondly, that all financial obligations contracted by Persia in Russia and England, floating debt included, must be embodied in a regular engagement which would determine a fixed annuity for interest and sinking fund, as well as revenues to serve as security. A warning might also be given that Russia and England, while not wishing to hamper liberty of purely commercial enterprise of other foreigners, cannot admit that concessions by which England’s and Russia’s political or strategic interests might be adversely affected should be given to foreigners.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of the 12th ultimo respecting the murder of certain Ismailis in the neighbourhood of Nishapur, and to report that I have informed the Minister of the Interior of the great importance attached by His Majesty’s Government to the exemplary punishment of the authors of these outrages. Major Sykes has recommended the dismissal of the Governors of Nishapur and Darrud, and the punishment of Moin-ul-Ghuruba and Haji Mahommed Bakir, all but the first of whom were undoubtedly more or less directly responsible for the murders. I have not been able to bring the Minister of Interior to give full satisfaction to these demands. His Excellency refuses to dismiss the Governor of Nishapur, against whom he declares he can obtain no proof, or to punish the fanatical Mujtehid Moin-ul- Ghuruba further than to exile him to Kerbela or Nejef. He has, however, dismissed the Governor of Darrud, and imprisoned Haji Mahommed Bakir, who he promises shall be kept in prison for life. The property taken from the Ismailis has also been restored. Although the result of my representations is not altogether satisfactory, I am disposed, having regard to the weakness of the central Government, to refrain from pressing the Minister of Interior further in the matter, except in the event of the Ismailis of the Nishapur district being further molested.

Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending March 24, 1910. Tehran. THE Medjliss has been chiefly occupied during the past four weeks in considering the various departmental budgets presented to it. Its public proceedings, however, are somewhat formal and uninteresting. Most of the work is done in secret. On the occasion of the Persian New Year the Shah and Regent held a reception of the corps diplomatique. Tabreez. Quiet has prevailed. The Government troops, some 900 strong, under Yprim and Sardar Bahadur, arrived from Karadagh on the 23rd February. On the 9th March His Majesty’s consul reported a recurrence among certain classes of the population of the agitation against the presence of the Russian troops. In reply to an enquiry from His Majesty’s Minister Mr. Shipley reported on the 12th March that the town was quiet. He added, however, that the necessity for the removal of Sattar and Bagher Khans was as urgent as ever, in order that the town might return to its normal condition. The two khans left Tabreez for Tehran with 100 horsemen and some Government troops on the 19th March. Resht. Moayyer-ul-Mamalek, the new Governor-General of Ghilan, arrived on the 3rd March. Order reigns in the town and district, but minor disturbances were reported early in March from Talish. A police force has been organised in Resht. Meshed. Meshed has remained quiet. Asaf-ed-Dowleh was early in March appointed to succeed Rukn-ed-I)owleh as Governor-General, but public opinion in lehran and Khorassan against the former was very strong and his appointment was cancelled. Seistan. The district remains quiet. Since the arrival of Hashmat-ul-Mulk in Seistan the administration has sensibly improved, and little is heard of the recalcitrant Belooch chiefs. Ispahan. The town has remained quiet. Sardar-i-Ashjaa has been confirmed in the governorship, Sardar-i-Zafar, however, informed Mr. Grahame that the _ central Government had decided, apparently to avoid jealousies among the Bakhtiari chiefs, that none of them should be Governor of Ispahan. He added that Sardar-i-Ashjaa would probably not retain office after the Persian New Year. He predicted that no one except Bakhtiaris would be able to keep order in Ispahan.38 The roads, that to Shiraz excepted, have been safe and traffic has been normal. On the Shiraz road, Kumisheh has since the middle of March been the scene of dis turbances caused by Karib Khan, formerly Chief of Police at Ispahan, who on his dismissal fled to that place, and has collected a force said to number 1,700 men. A force of 400 infantry and fifty Bakhtiari horsemen, with guns, has been dispatched from Ispahan to deal with him, and another from Chahar Mahal is to co-operate with it. Yezd. The town has remained quiet. The roads, that to Kerman excepted, have con tinued safe. On the Kerman road several large bands of robbers have plundered several caravans and posts, and the road is again quite unsafe. The governor with a force has taken the field against the robbers, and has captured one party of thirty men with 900 plundered sheep. The local assembly has not yet accepted a Parsee member, though ordered to do so b}? the central Government. No member for Yezd has yet been elected to the National Assembly. Kermanshah. The town continues quiet and is efficiently policed. The roads are safe and blackmailing of caravans has ceased. Throughout the province all is reported quiet. Much credit is due to Nizam-es-Sultaneh who is moving about the province with a force of all arms arresting various offenders. Three of his more important prisoners have been sent to Tehran for punishment. The local assembly endeavoured to get them tried at Kermanshah, but the governor insisted on sending them to Tehran. His firmness has had a good effect, and some of the tribes have submitted and sent contingents to join him ; his total force now numbers 2,000 men. Daoud Khan and other important tribal chiefs seem inclined to submit to the Government. Kerman. Quiet has prevailed. Kawam-ul-Mulk has been appointed governor for the next year. He has received satisfactory messages from the Belooch chiefs, whom he has arranged to meet at Bam, where their grievances will be discussed. The administrative methods of reformers sent from Tehran have somewhat irritated the population, but an attempt by a priest to raise an agitation against them has failed. The roads to Yezd and Bunder Abbas are practically blocked to traffic owing to the presence of bands of robbers who have committed many robberies. Shir uz. The town has on the whole remained quiet. There have, however, been several in Am 168 an - d a / - 1 ! nob recen % raided the house of M. Nataf, the representative of the AliLance Israelite, he and his wife being compelled to seek refuge in his Maiesty s consulate. Na_sir-ubMulk has been appointed deputy governor. The Governor-General elect, Zafar-es-Sultaneh, has only recently left Tehran for Shiraz. The Ispahan road, especially near Sivend, and the Kazerun route to Bushire between Kazerun and Daliki are very unsafe, numerous robberies of posts and caravans being reported. The Jirreh road is open under the auspices of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. but it is reported to lack accom modation at the various stages. Moreover, the muleteers strongly resent Soulet-ed- Dowleh s recent arrangement with the khans of Daliki and Borasjun to divert the trade through their territories, this entails two long marches along a bad road on which no dive^r+ff 1 '^ tf m be - ! ad ; T • he khans . of Tan gistan and Chahkuteh are also trying to th^ Lt h ^ lat( ^ tkeir omi Jurisdiction.

IN reply to your Excellency’s note of the 8th Rabbi-ul-Avval, \\ e, the undersigned, British and Russian Ministers in Persia, have the honour to inform you that the British and Russian Governments are ready to recognise the right of the lersian Government to borrow money of parties other than the two Governments, but only on the following conditions :— 1. The customs revenues and other revenues serving as security for the English and Russian loans may not in any case serve as security for new financial operations. 2. All debts of the Persian Government to England and Russia must previously form the subject of a special formal engagement which shall fix a definite annuity foi interest and sinking fund, and indicate the sources of revenue to serve as security for the regularity of the annual payments. We have further the honour to inform you that England and Russia, while not hampering the rights of nationals of other Powers to purely commercial enterprise in Persia, cannot admit in any case that concessions _ affecting their political or strategic interests in Persia should be given to the nationals of other foreign Powers.

IN answer to the communication dated the 5th Sefer, 1328, signed by his Excellency Sir George Barclay and his Excellency M. Poklew r ski-Koziell, respecting the advance and loan proposed by the Persian Government to the British and Russian Governments, it is submitted with the highest respect that your Excellency’s sense of justice will of course cause you to admit that in the matter of a loan the only conditions which can be entertained are those relating to the fixing of interest the term of amortisation, and the manner of its repayment. In^ these circumstances, regarding the advance and loan which were under iscussion between the Ministers of my Government and the two legations, in view of the friendly relations between the two Governments, there was no expectation of any conditions beyond those relating to the amount, the interest, the source of revenue for repayment, and the manner of repayment, especially in the event of a portion of the conditions referred to above being suspected of incompatibility with the principles of the freedom and independence of the State. i ^ cb ux nrrl o b eg ^ ldlnS f he ? 0intSrelatil ^ t0 l , financial ref °™ and the means of maintaining ordei and security also, as your Excellency is aware, these two points were included in the programme submitted by the Ministers to the National Assembly.

Persia for the past four weeks. tonthly summary of events in I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING.Enclosure in No. 89. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending April 21, 1910. The National Assembly. THE deputies are now some sixty in number, and are divided into two principal groups, known generally as the “extremists” and “moderates.” The former is described by some as a “ noisy minority,” and is said to be composed of only fourteen persons, including Taki Zadeh and Hussein Kuli Khan. They are opposed to the Prime Minister (Sipahdar) and, in a lesser degree, to the Minister ot the Interior (Sardar Assad). The working majority of “ moderates,” which is probably not composed of more than some thirty members, realise that the best chance ot success lies in the support of the two chiefs, Sipahdar and Sardar Assad. On the 4th instant the two parties had a trial of strength over the re-election of a president and other officers, as well as the election of members for the various committees, all of whom were until then only elected temporarily. The moderates obtained the re-election of their president (Mustashar-ed-Dowleh) and 'the former vice-presidents, but of the six members of the committee for foreign affairs three were extremists (i.e., Taki Zadeh, Hussein Kuli Khan, and Vahid-ul-Mulk). A trial is being made by the assembly to revive the attempt made by its predecessor to raise money internally. Committees have been formed at Tehran and the provinces to collect funds, and 500,000 tomans is promised from dabreez, but so far very little money has actually been collected. Since the Persian new year (the 21st March) the sittings have been held in the new hall, which has been fitted up at great expense for the purpose. The deputies no longer sit in rows on the floor, but are accommodated in luxurious benches arranged in tiers facing the presidential chair. Speeches are made from a tribune, and proper arrangements have been made for the diplomatic body, the public, and the press. Tabreez. At the beginning of April the 400 Bakhtiaris at Tabreez under Saidar Bahadur (Sardar Assad’s son) left for Ardebil with 170 fedais under Yprim, 100 Persian Cossacks, and some artillery. The object of the expedition is to deal with the Shahsevan tribe, which had recently been pillaging in the Ardebil district. Ispahan. 1. Sardar-i-Ashj aa continues to act as governor. 2. The revolt of Karib Khan at Kumisheh terminated on the 3rd instant, when the Bakhtiari forces, said to number 1,400, attacked a fort in which Karib Khan and his followers were defending themselves. Fifteen of the insurgents were killed, and the remainder captured, but Karib Khan contrived to escape. The governor, who went to Kumisheh to direct operations, returned to Ispahan with the prisoners. 3 News having reached the legation of an attack on Mr. Bill while on his way from Shiraz to Ispahan, orders were sent by Sardar Assad to Sardar Ashjaa to send all the available force of Bakhtiaris from Kumisheh to meet Mr. Bill and bring him safely out of the danger zone. Mr. Grahame also proceeded to the spot to ensure the carrying out of these instructions. Mr. Bill eventually reached Kumisheh safely. Although particulars have not yet been received, it is known that two Indian sowars were killed by the robbers, who were probably of the Kuhgelu tribe, and that Mr. Bills party killed two of the robbers. The Persian Government is being held responsible for 4 4. Zaffer-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor of Ears, arrived at Ispahan on his way to Shiraz on the 17th instant. Y ezd. The reports received from the acting vice-consul lay stress upon the insecurity prevailing on the roads throughout the district. Shiraz. The town and piwince were in considerable disorder throughout March.46 Kerman. The road to Yezd has been overrun by robbers, but the Bakhtiari Governor of Yezd (Sardar-i-Jang) has taken energetic action against them, with some success. Kermanshah. Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the new governor, appears to be doing well, and the town and province are reported to be comparatively quiet. The roads are safe, and the tribes are submissive. ISTo. 90.

As for a definite* arrangement for the47 floating debts, viz., the interest to be paid on them and the regular payment of the instalments, the Persian Government were prepared to do that with the assistance of the two Governments. As to the last part of the joint note, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated at the interview that the meaning of it was not clear to the Persian Government. If, as it was rumoured, it referred to the question of railways, he might say that the Persian Government have no intention of giving railway concessions to foreigners, and have decided to reserve it for themselves. At the conclusion of the interview the Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to send a reply to the joint note on the 7th May. In their reply, which they sent on that day, the Persian Government stated, in regard to the first point raised in the joint note, that they would act in accordance with the provisions of the contracts made for the loans from the two Governments. In regard to the second point, they said they would make the necessary arrangements with the assistance of the two Great Powers. As to the last point of the joint note, the Imperial Persian Government stated that as it was vague they would defer their reply until the receipt of a written explanation from the two Governments, when they would express their opinion. Sir Edward Grey will see that the Persian Government have given their reply to the two points raised in the joint note. As to that part of the note which referred to grant of concessions, the Persian Government have deferred their reply until they have the explanations asked for.

No. 93. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May 21, 1910. WITH reference to your telegram of the 19th May, the Russian Govern ment, holding the view that the reply of the two Governments is in the nature of a commentary on the note of the 7th April, propose that you and the Russian Minister should intimate to the Persian Government that the communication expresses the categorical desires of the two Governments, who, if the Persian Government does not comply with them, will be .obliged to take measures to safeguard their interests, but that no answer is expected. _ ^ . I have accepted this suggestion, in accordance with which you may now act. No. 94. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 23.) (Telegraphic.) , , ,, Mai J 23 &gt; 191 °- , I RECEIVED yesterday a visit from a distinguished Persian, who came to sound me as to how the appointment of financial advisers would be viewed by His Majesty’s * For text of note see No. 10G.Government. He informed me that the Persian Government, bearing in mind the insistence of the two legations on the scheme drawn np by M. Bizot, had decided to employ Frenchmen in the Ministry of Finance, and that the Medjliss was prepared to sanction their appointment. No. 95. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 23.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 23, 1910. IN continnation of my immediately preceding telegram, my visitor also referred to the question of advance and loan to Persian Government, concerning which vague intimations have already reached M. Poklewsky and me. He stated that the necessity of solidarity and of friendly and intimate relations with the joint Powers was now becoming clear to Persian Government. The conditions attached to financial aid from the two Powers had alarmed public opinion, but it was now being comprehended that in drawing up these conditions England and Russia were safeguarding their own interests, and had no designs against the country. Persia had given us satisfaction on one point by her reply to the joint note of the 7th April; she was about to do so on a second by the engagement of foreign experts to superintend the Finance Department. In view of these facts she had a strong moral claim to our help. Money was badly needed by Persian Government, but they had practically pledged themselves not to obtain it except through the two Governments. In reply, I stated that His Majesty’s Government had a sincere desire to assist Persia. I had not been informed of what His Majesty’s Government’s views were regarding an advance and subsequent loan, but I thought that they would recognise the moral claim on them that Persia possessed. M. Poklewsky also had a long and friendly interview with a member of the Cabinet, who hinted at the subject mentioned above. M. Poklewsky and I concur in thinking that a very appreciable change has recently ta £en place m the attitude of the Cabinet, and we think that the opportunity should be utilised to gam the confidence of the Persians by offering tangible proof of our good-will. ^ Provided that foreign experts are engaged, I submit that, except to provide security for service and for repayment in the event of a subsequent loan bein£ concluded, we should make the advance without conditions. generally 1 ^ 6 ^ ^ WOulcl give stabilit y to present Cabinet and inspire confidence Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 25.)

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received June 6.) Tehran, May 15, 1910. DURING the last part of April and the earlier days of this month rumours were constantly circulated of the conclusion of financial operations by the Persian Government, but neither M. Poklewski nor I have been able to discover any fgoo mmdation for them. Sir50 The idea of selling the Crown jewels has apparently been shelved for the present, and an attempt is being made to raise an internal loan of 1,000,0001. at 7 per cent, on the security of the Crown domains, which are said to bring in 100,000Z. per annum. A similar attempt, made during the session of the first Assembly, proved a conspicuous failure, and though there are some who are less sceptical than I as to the outcome of the present attempt, there cannot be any doubt as to the difficulties which the promoters of this scheme will have to overcome. The recommendations of the committee of the Medjliss appointed to examine the question are as follows :— 1. That the proceeds of the loan should be devoted to organisation and reform on lines to be approved by the House. 2. That a committee should be elected composed of members of the House and others for this purpose. Foreign officials might be engaged to form part of this committee or board. 3. That the amount of revenue from Crown lands should be ascertained, and that provision should be made from this source for the amortisation of the capital and payment of the interest on the loan. Should the aforesaid revenue prove insufficient, any deficit to be made good from the passport receipts. The committee further recommended that loan coupons should be accepted in settlement of amounts due on account of revenue. 4. That the distribution of the bonds and collection of subscriptions throughout the country should be entrusted to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and that subscribers should everywhere make their applications and payments to the local branch or agency of the bank. 5. That a European official should be engaged from abroad as a financial expert to supervise and control the repayment of principal and interest, and to administer the resources assigned for this purpose. Various rates of interest, from 5 per cent, to 9 per cent., had been proposed, but the committee recommended the adoption of 7 per cent., and that the period should be for twenty years, and that the issue should amount to 5,000,000 tomans, in bonds of 10 tomans each.

Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for the four weeks ending May 18, 1910. Tehran. THE sad news of the death of His Majesty King Edward VII reached Tehran early on the 7th May. His Majesty King George’s telegram to the Shah announcing the event was received during the day. The following morning the Shah’s representative, the Cabinet Ministers, and other officials and notables called on His Majesty’s charge d’affaires to offer condolences. The memorial service will be held at the Protestant church on the 20th. 2. The Persian Government’s reply to the Anglo-Russian joint note of the 7t i A pul was received on the 8th May. It agrees to points (1) arid (2) as to the necessity of not alienating any revenues already pledged, and of consolidating the floating debts, but asks for explanations as to u concessions.” The reply to this note is in course of preparation. i ■ - i3. The Cabinet crisis terminated on the 29th April. The following is a list of the Ministers, from which it will be seen that Sipahdar and Sardar Assad have changed posts, and that there is no longer a Minister of Posts and Telegraphs :— Premier and Minister of Interior Minister of War Minister of Foreign Affairs . „ Minister of Justice «, Minister of Finance „ „ Minister of Public Works, Education, &amp;c. Minister of Commerce Sipahdar. Sardar Assad. Moavin-ed-Dowleh. Mushir -ed-Dowleh. Vosouk-ed-Dowleh. Sani-ed-Dowleh. Motamid-i-Khakan. Dabir-ul-Mulk has been appointed Under-Secretar j for the Interior and Kavam-es- Sultaneh Under-Secretary for War. 4. The National Assembly on the 10th May paid a special tribute to His late Majesty King Edward VII. While the members all stood the president delivered an eloquent address extolling the virtues of His late Majesty, and expressing the sorrow felt by the Persian nation on this sad occasion. A telegram was sent to the British Parliament conveying these sentiments. ^ . On the 28th ultimo the committee elected to organise an internal loan submitted its recommendations, which were that 1,000,000/. should be raised at^ 7 per cent, interest a year on the guarantee of the crown lands. The matter is dealt with fully in Mr. Marling’s despatch of the 15th May. The new Cabinet attended the house the 30th April, when Sipahdar announced that he and Sardar Assad had exchanged There having been a scarcity of bread in the capital a committee was elected ^ to investigate the matter and take steps to remedy the evil. Considerable dissatisfaction and some popular outcry having been caused by the alleged irregularities ol the Ministry of Justice, a committee was elected to investigate the matter, and is now at work. Tabreez. The Government forces under Yprim and Sardar Bahadur, which, as reported in the last summary, were operating in the direction of Ardebil against the Shahsevan tribe, have been entirely successful. The Shahsevans have been complete y °^ er - powered and comparative tranquillity seems to have now been restored m that part ot Azerbaijan. Resht. The new governor of Ghilan does not seem to be very successful in maintaining order. A great deal of trouble has been occasioned by incendiaries, and many arrests have been made. The roads, however, are reported to be safe. Nishapur. Serious riots occurred on the 16th instant owing, it is said, to the cornering of wheat, &amp;c., but a force of police sent from Meshed succeeded m restoring order. Ispahan. Mrs Marrable, an English missionary, was assaulted by some peasants or muleteers while cycling near Ispahan. Mr. Grabame, m reporting this incident, draws attention to the growin| insolence of the population of Ispahan towards Europeans mue h in the same condition as usual. It is reported that there is much dissatisfaction among native merchants at the delays, on the Ahwaz road. Messrs Lynch have had considerable trouble with the Bakhtiaris m connection with a laro-e caravan of specie they are bringing up by that road. After long delays the extortionate demands of the khans the caravan is at last on the move. Yezd. A woman who had been convicted, by her own confession, of having strangled her . Z faced 5 years) by another wife, was thrown from a building about 20 5s high. She was still alive when she reached the ground, and was thereupon stoned to death by other women who were looking on.The governor, Sardar-i-Jang, a Bakhtiari khan, has successfully operated against a large band of robbers on the Yezd-Bafk road. (Bafk is a district about 60 miles to the south-east of Yezd.) In the middle of April be brought m his prisoners to Yezd. Fifty-nine unwounded men were chained together in single file and entered the town on foot; five wounded men were brought in on camels, and leader, who had three bullet wounds, in a “palaki” Over 100 of the robber band were either killed or captured. The governor complains that, though the lehran authorities are unstinting in their praises of his recent exploits, they leave him to beai the expenses thereof himself. Shiraz. The movements of Soulet-ed-Dowleh (the present chief of the Kashgai tiibe),^ Zaygham-ed-Dowleh, his brother, and Zaffer-es-Sultan eh, the new Governor-(general of Bars, are attracting a good deal ol attention at present. The new governor left Ispahan on his way to his post on the 1st instant, but only left Abadeh on the 18th, having delayed his journey on account of pourparlers with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who is some miles south of Shiraz. Zaygham-ed-Dowleh, who travelled for some way with the governor, subsequently detached himself, and is now said to have collected a force of some 2,000 Kashgais around him, with the object of overthrowing his brother. Kerman. A great deal of damage has been done by floods, which have devastated nearly 150 villages. The damage done at Bafsinjan is reported to be very considerable, 30 persons having been drowned and 4,000 rendered homeless. The damage done to the crops is likely to cause a famine this year in the district. Bobbers are plundering round Kerman, and travellers are not safe even within 8 miles of the city. Hamadan and Kermanshah. Both towns and surrounding districts and roads are reported to be in comparatively good order. The Governor of Hamadan proceeded with a small force against a formidable robber, who looted caravans on the road between Hamadan and Kermanshah, with the result that the robber and his followers have fled.

Barclay and the Russian Minister, stating “ les Gouvernements d Angleterre et de Russie sont prets a reconnaitre le droit du Gouvernemettt persan a emprunter de Targent en dehors des deux Gouvernements, mais seulement aux conditions smvantes. In reply, respecting the first point, which states that les revenue de la douane et autres revenus servant de garantie aux emprunts anglais et russes P e uven ans aucun cas servir de garantie a de nouvelles operations financieres, 1 have the hono to sav that the Persian Government agrees on this point, and whatever has been inserted in the documents of the Government loans will be carried out m this respect. With regard to the second point, respecting the arrangements to be made w t regard to all the debts of the Persian Government to the Russian and British Goverm mpnts although the Persian Government does not see any connection between t condition and the right to make a fresh loan, as special revenues have been set aside for the debts of the Persian Government; but in spite of this, the Persian Government54 is prepared with the moral help of the two Governments to make a definite arrange ment regarding its recognised floating debts, which will include the fixing of the rate of yearly interest, the manner in which the debt will be paid, and the instalments payable from the specified revenues. But as to the statement made at the end of the note, as follows . L Angleterre et la Russie, tout en ne pas entravant les droits des nationaux d autres Puissances aux entreprises purement commerciales en Perse, ne peuvent en aucun cas admettre qu il soit accorde aux nationaux d’autres Puissances etrangeres des concessions qui puissent porter atteinte a leurs interets politiques ou strategiques en Perse. Owing to the ambiguity of this part of the note, the Persian Government postpone replying to it until the above passage is explained in writing, and the word concession, ^hich is used in a general sense at the end of the note, is explained, so that the 1 ersian Government may also give a reply on this point. j avail, ac. 1V&gt;P A TTTA1 Enclosure 2 in No. 106. Joint Note communicated to the Moavin-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Teheran, le 7 (20) mai, 1910. EN reponse a votre note du 26 Rebbi-us-Sani, nous, soussignes, le Ministre de Russie et le charge d’affaires de la Grande-Bretagno, avons 1’honneur de donner a votre Excellence les explications suivantes concernant la clause finale de notre note du 2o Rebbi-ul-Avvel:— Yu la difficulte de specifier les concessions qui pourraient porter atteinte a leurs interets politiques ou strategiques, les deux Puissances s’attendent a ce qu’avant de delivrer des concessions quelconques de voies de communication, de telegraphes et de ports a un sujet etranger, le Gouvernement persan entre dans un echange de vues avec elles afin que les interets politiques ou strategiques des deux Puissances puissent etre dument sauvegardes.

IN reply to your note of the 26th Rebbi-us-Sani, we, the undersigned, the Russian Minister and the British charge d’affaires, have the honour to give your Excellency the following explanations concerning the final sentence of our note of the 25th Rebbi-ul-Avval:— In view of the difficulty of defining concessions which might injuriously affect tbeir political or strategic interests, the two Powers expect that before granting any concessions for means of communications for telegraphs or harbours to a foreign subject, the Persian Government will enter into an exchange of views with them in oi dei that the political or strategic interests of the two Powers may be duly safe guarded. Any act in contravention of this principle would be regarded as contrary to the traditional friendship so happily existing between Persia and Russia and Great Britain. No. 107.

If, however, you cannot succeed in doing this, it would be enough, provided the Russian Government agree, to conveyto them a verbal expression of our regret* pointing out the consequences of thus disregarding our wishes. I had been led to hope that the Persian Government had entered upon a policy of greater friendliness, and I was prepared to meet their advances with encouragement, but a very bad impression will be produced if they insist on sending, quite unnecessarily, an unsatisfactory reply to our very moderate note.

Poldewsky had recommended that the matter should be left in abeyance until that of the reply of the Persian Government to the recent joint communication hac been settled. He asked whether Mr. Marling had not made a similar recommendation. I replied in the affirmative, but said that I did not know whether you agreed with the course recommended by the two representatives. It seemed^ to me that it would be a good thing in any case to come to an agreement in prmcipffi as to the_ advance, lie said that he concurred with this view, and was now only awaiting certain information on technical points from Tehran. At the same time, he was of opinion that the two Governments must take into account the suggestion made by their represen a ives a Tehran, that for the present the reply to the Persian Government as to an advance should be deferred.

I have, &amp;c, _absolutely safe and sufficient security. With a view, therefore, to enabling the Imperial Government to carry out the proposal of an advance to the Persian Government, it will probably be necessary to find some other source of revenue to serve as security for the sinking fund and interest of the Russian share of the advance in the event of the above-mentioned revenues proving insufficient; for this purpose the surplus revenues of the Southern Persian customs, which are still substantial, might be utilised if the British Government should see no objection. It is to be noted, in this connection, that at the present moment the position of the Persian Cabinet is by no means firm, and M. Poklewski and Mr. Marling think that it would be desirable to leave them to choose the proper moment for putting the proposed measure into execution. Being wholly of the same opinion, the Imperial Government propose to advance the sum of 400,0001. to the Persian Government only when the two representatives have informed their Governments that the moment is opportune.

In view of the fact, however, that the presence of the former in the Cabinet was regarded as essential bv the Prime Minister, he has been appointed Minister of Commerce. At the same time, Motamed Khaghan became Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. ^ The accession of Sardar Mansur to the Cabinet is generally regarded as a sign of the increasing influence of the party which favours good and intimate relations with Russia and Great Britain.

I need not insist on the state of the Ispahan road, which has beenclosed to caravans for over two months. The post is robbed with monotonous regularity, and, if by exception, a post gets through safely, it has only to thank the forbearance of the robbers. North of Abadeh the Kuhgeluis, and south of Dehbid the Arabs, appear to be in undisputed possession of the road. Nasr-ed-Dowleh, who is now among the Arabs at Kenareh, seems to have lost control of them for the present, the Jirreh route, under Soulet’s care, has been safe, but is now closed to down traffic. W ithout notifying or consulting the Fars authorities, to whom he had given written guarantees for the policing of the road, he suddenly informed the merchants of Shiraz that, after sixteen days he would be no longer responsible for any new caravans on the Jirreh road. The result is the suspension of all transport trade pending the conclusion of some new arrangement with Soulet, who is now in Khan-i-Khabis, where delegates of the merchants have gone out to see him. It is said that he wishes to change the Bushire road to the Firuzabad route, and to assume charge of the Ispahan road. The telegraph lines have been suffering much from interruptions, on the north by Arabs, on the south by Kashgais. The behaviour of the latter round Dastarjin, where they are continually cutting the wires, breaking into the telegraph office, stripping t le gholams, is far worse than in previous years. Soulet promised Mr. Bill that this year his tribe would avoid Dastarjin on their march northwards. Ten days ago the shoori section of the tribe passed through Dastarjio, making havoc on its way lo my complaints Soulet replied that, to his regret, this one tribe had been forced to pass through Dastariin, but that he did not believe the Darashoon capable M such improper behaviour. Since then, one by one, the different tribes of the Kashgais have passed, or are passing, through Dastarjin, each adding its quota to the work of destruction Beyond unfulfilled promises of preventative or punitive measures and expressions of regret, my representations to Soulet appear to have as yet produced little eflect.

THE Cabinet, after protracted negotiations with the the 21st May, as follows Premier and Minister of interior Minister of War ,, Foreign Affairs ... ,, Finance ,, Justice... ,, Posts and Telegraphs ,, Commerce „ Public Works Medjliss, was reconstructed on Sipahdar. Sardar Assad. .. Moavin-ed-Dowleh. Yosouk-ed-Dowleh. .. Sardar Mansour. .. Motamid-i-Khakan. Mushir-ed-Dowleh. .. Sani-ed-Dowleh.60 The newspapers ridiculed the constant exchange of portfolios by the above eight Ministers, and spoke in very disrespectful terms of Sipahdar and the new Minister of J ustice. On the 25th May the offending newspapers were suppressed by order of the Cabinet, and their editors were ordered to appear at the Courts of Justice to be tried, but this they refused to do. In consequence of considerable popular excitement Sardar Assad permitted the papers to reappear, and Sipahdar promptly withdrew from the Cabinet and retired to a country house. Negotiations continued until the 9th instant, when Sipahdar was induced to return to town. An attempt was made to form a Cabinet without him, but was not successful. Between 8 and 9 p.m. on the 28th May some unknown armed persons entered the house of Amin-ul-Mulk, formerly postmaster, and a person known to have reactionary tendencies, and shot him, after which they made their escape. On the 26th May an agreement between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank of Persia, for the consolidation of the Persian Government’s floating debt, was signed. The Medjliss. The Cabinet changes were announced to the House by the Premier on the 21st May. At the same sitting the House approved and passed the report of the Budget Committee to allow the import free of customs duty of certain machinery for the manufacture of tools and buttons which it is proposed to undertake at Tabreez. At the sitting of the 26th May, the House approved the arrangement concluded by the Government with the Bussian legation respecting the exports of lamb skins. The suppression of the newspapers was then brought up and made the subject of violent attacks on the Ministry, who were accused of unconstitutional behaviour. On the 4th June, the President announced that Vakil-ul-Boaya would not in future afford any assistance, as he had done in the past, to the executive departments. This was in consequence of the hostile criticism to which his action had given rise. Votes were taken, with the result that the majority approved of his continued activity in the executive branch while still a member. On the 7th June, Prince Assadullah Mirza, in his capacity of reporter to the committee formed to deal with the Cabinet crisis resulting from the suppression of the newspapers and other causes, read a long speech containing the conclusions arrived at by his committee. The statement contained a reference to the demand of Sardar Assad on behalf of himself and the Premier for fuller powers than they possessed in order to deal effectively with the situation. This, it would seem, the committee was not prepared to recommend. A reference to the Begent had been made and he had stated that he was opposed to a change of Cabinet. On the 12th June after Sipahdar had been induced to return to Tehran from the country where he had retired, one of the members gave an authoritative account of recent negotiations respecting the Cabinet crisis. He stated that the Beo-ent had sent for the President and had sent a message through him to the House to the effect that he deprecated a change of Cabinet. It had therefore been decided to form another committee to discuss matters with the former Ministers with a view to a settlement. Another deputy strongly condemned the system by which important matters of State were discussed by committees m secret, whereupon the President withdrew He was however, induced‘to return and a committee was eventually chosen to deal with the matter. Tabrees. Ihe situation in Azerbaijan is normal. Tte&amp;ht, 1. Jelal-ed-Dowleh, eldest son of ZiPes-Sultan, passed through Besht oh the 15th May on his way to Tehran. 2 jl T i ie T d the . the judicial and police departments have quarrelled with the local assembly, which they refuse to allow to interfere in adminis trative affairs Ihe members of the local assembly threatened to resign or to report matters to Tehran. Letters threatening the governor and other officials have been scattered about the town. J. Kawam-ed-Dowleh, Minister of I inance under the reactionary regime, wasarrested on the 16th May at Enzeli, on his way to Europe, as he had failed to appoint a responsible agent to represent him in Tehran. He has since been allowed to return to Tehran. 4. On the 19th May, the local press published a telegram from the Minister of the Interior (Sipahdar), informing the public that in future all cases between Persians and foreign subjects should be tried in the Persian law courts, and that the local Foreign Office agent has no right to interfere, but may be present at important cases. Meshed. On the whole, Khorassan may be said to be fairly orderly. Robbers from Ears have harried its western borders, but this is nothing unusual. Meshed itself and the surrounding districts are quiet, but the administration is said to have perceptibly slackened during the last few months. Up to date Khorassan has paid its revenue on the whole very well, but considerable difficulty is anticipated in its collection during the ensuing year. During May, numerous robberies were reported on the roads in the west of the province, and on the main trade road to Seistan. Ispahan. 1. A local journal having published an article reflecting on the Bakhtiari regime at Ispahan, a number of Bakhtiaris • assumed a threatening attitude towards the editor. The Governor-General had the editor tried, and he was condemned to fourteen days’ imprisonment ; his paper to be suppressed for three months. The Governor-General, however, released the editor. 2. During May the condition of all the roads was normal, posts arrived regularly, and no robberies were reported. Kashan. On the 27th May, Naib Hussein, who disturbed the peace of Kashan some four months ago, was reported to be within 4 miles of the town, with 250 men. On the 28th two of his sons, with 150 men, entered Kashan unopposed, Naib Hussein remaining at Finn. On the 2nd June he posted notices on the town gate, which, after stating the rates at which food-stufis were to be sold, went on to say that if the governor did. not leave the town that night he would be attacked. The Naib added tbat^ he had no intention of interfering with the town or the people, except seven or eight of his enemies. The Government troops remained in occupation of the positions they had taken up in the town, and on the 6th, 7th, and 8th June a good deal of firing took place, resulting m the Government troops losing one killed and two wounded, while the Naib’was said^to have had eight casualties. Reinforcements for the Government troops have been dispatched from Kum. Yezd. On the whole the roads have been undisturbed, but two robberies were reported the first on the Kerman road in the middle of May, when the post was robbed; ’this was done by a gang of some 300 robbers, whom the governor pursued to the Ears boundary. He was unable to do more than engage their rear-guard, from which he recovered twenty donkeys, three or four of the robbers being killed. Ihe second robbery occurred on the Tabbas road_ at the end of May, when a caravan was looted and several Afghan camel-men were killed. Asa result of representations made by His Majesty’s Deration, the Minister of the Interior sent urgent orders for the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators. Steps are being taken to provide road guards, but it appears that those employed are not regularly paid. Some troubles and outrages are reported from the district. At Ardekan the exactions of the local governor led to seventy villagers forcing their way into the telephone office and demanding that they be allowed to pay taxes direct to Yezd. At Nain a hooligan who killed a servant of the deputy governor in the mosque and wounded two inoffensive Jewish pedlars was not arrested, as the deputy governor was afraid of the mans followers. At Taft a sevyid made an unprovoked attack on an old Parsee and wounded him on the head and face with a knife In Yezd itself a Parsee endowment house, which was twelve years aVo illegally seized bv a Mahommedan neighbour during the absence of the trustee, was recently restored to'the Parsees by order of the governor, who gave permission to rebuild the dividing wall. On appeal this decision was revoked, but permission was given by the governor to the Parsees to refer the matter to Tehran Despite this, the Mahommedan on the 6th June broke down the wall, and beat and abused the Parsee62 woman in charge. An appeal by the Parsee community to the governor was met with vituperation. The Parsees contemplated taking refuge in the British telegraph office, but were dissuaded from doing so by Mr. Blackman. An urgent demand has been made for the first instalment of this years taxes of which the governor seems determined to enforce payment, irrespective of the people’s ability to pay. Kermanshah. The roads have all remained safe, and the province in good order except for some tribal fighting on the Kurdistan border. The governor is in negotiation with Daoud Khan, the Kalhur chief, and is awaiting the arrival of some Bakhtiari horsemen before moving from Kermanshah. Daoud Khan is reported to be apprehensive of the force being collected by the governor, and to be ready to make terms with him. Some discontent was expressed against the methods adopted by the governor for restoring order, but his prompt arrest of two of the ringleaders of the malcontents has put a stop to the agitation. Hamadan. Several robberies are reported, and the police are said to be very unsatisfactory. Kerman. Sardar-i-Zaffar, Bakhtiari, has been appointed governor in succession to Kawam- ul-Mulk. He will not reach Kerman for three months, during which time the Governor of Yezd will officiate for him. Kawam-ul-Mulk has resigned the post on the grounds that the central Government have not given him proper support, and have not protected his property in Bars, and because the deputy governor took advantage of his absence on tour to intrigue against him. During his tour Kawam-ul-Mulk collected a certain amount of taxes and punished several local governors for oppression and extortion. Shiraz. Zaffer-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor-General, arrived at the beginning of June, since when quiet has prevailed in the town. The Kashgais appear to be divided into two parties under Zaygham-ed-Dowleh and Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and the latter’s attitude towards the Governor-General is said to be submissive. The Bushire road via Kazerun appears to be once more open to traffic, and four Bussian Cossacks travelled by it in safety to Shiraz. The post is also now sent by this route. On the Ispahan road the section near Sivend is reported unsafe, though no specific acts of robbery are reported. Persian Gulf. Bushire. 1. Early in May the new Governor-General of Ears telegraphed to Darya Beggi informing him that the Gulf ports had been placed under him (the Governor-General), and confirming the Darya Beggi in their governorship. 2. At the end of April the Customs Department, with the help of the Khan of Bunder Big, established a custom-house near the mouth of the Budhilla Biver, a well- known resort of smugglers. No. 121.

THERE has been a notable increase of insecurity lately on the main roads, and Kashgai robbers are terrorising the environs of Ispahan. As no effect has been produced by the strongly-worded representations which I have addressed to the Persian Government, I sent Abbas Kuli Khan yesterday to inform the Council of Ministers that the situation was becoming intolerable to His Majesty’s Government. Sardar Assad at once replied that the Government could but anticipate that we should take military action : our forbearance in not having sent troops before had been gratefully appreciated b} 7 Persia ; and the Government would take energetic measures to restore order in Ears and elsewhere as it had now done in the north. Abbas Kuli Khan’s, strong but not threatening language was very well received, and I believe that some effort will be made to re-establish order in the country. No. 123.

IN continuation of my immediately preceding telegram, I have the honour to report that situation in Ispahan is described as disquieting by His Majesty’s eonsul- o-eneral. Mr. Grahame reports that Kashgais and Baktiaris are looting the Ahwaz road and that some 200 to 300 of the former tribesmen are in Ispahan itself, where they’outnumber the force at the disposal of the Governor-General, who is powerless to repress them. One hundred of Governor-General’s men are under orders to leave for Kumisheh whither, it is stated, he himself will go to interview Soulet-ed-Dowleh. His Majesty’s consul-general does not, however, state the purpose of this interview.

Murderer and most of the villagers escaped. Gun-boat was sent from Ashurada, and on arrival fired three shots as warning. Murderer eventually surrendered to Russian frontier post, saying that he preferred to be tried by Russians rather than by Persians. He will be tried in Russia, and will probably not be executed, but indemnity will be exacted from villagers. Incident caused no excitement here, and may be considered closed. No. 128.

It is not expected that any attempt will be made to punish the murderers, as witnesses dare not identify them. For the last two days bazaars have remained closed, but disorder is not feared at present. No. 129. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received July 18.) Si r ’ it* . Gulahek, July 2, 1910. 1 tilt number pf robberies on the high roads during the last few days point to an alaimmg increase in the insecurity of Persia. The European post-cart w T as attacked and looted pt Buinek, some 20 miles from Kazvin, on the Resht road, and two cases of t e same kind have been reported to me as having taken place near Kum, in one the mail from Sultanabad, and in the other the mail from Ispahan having been looted. Besides this, the Ispahan-Tehran road is rendered dangerous by the outrages committed by the notorious Naib Hussein, whose exploits, first at Kashan and now near Kum, the Government appear to be powerless to arrest, and a violent assault and robbery by armed men on some employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, about / miles east of lehran, three days ago shows that lawlessness prevails at the very gates oi tno C3&gt;T)iLci-L. Three of four eases of robbery, one of them on a caravan on the Ahwaz route have occurred m the immediate neighbourhood of Ispahan. Of the condition of the roads between Ispahan and Shiraz and Shiraz and Bushire you are only too well aware, and the slight improvement which I was able to report appears to have been a mere oause to allow the marauding tribesmen to see whether the arrival of Zaffer-es-Sultaneh the new Oovernor-General, at Shiraz meant that serious measures were about to be taken to restore order. Lur tri“t1caml' P und e er hj ^ I he state of the Yezd-Tabbas-Meshed road, on which a large British Indian caravan of over 200 camels was captured by a force of 300 Arab robbers about a month ago, is deplorable ; while, 60 or /0 miles west of Kuh-i-Malik-Siah, Afghan gun-runners HnYanThale knT'h 8 ' P ‘ ^ Iud °- E ' r0 P ean Telegraph Department's central Persian to Pobat 1 d * necessary for the English employes on the line to fly for safety Thus, practically all the chief routes used by British trade are more or less unsafe I have lost no opportunity of urging on the Persian Government, both verbally and in writing, the paramount importance of taking energetic measures to put an end to thisstate of affairs, and I propose to bring it to the notice of tire president of the Medjliss. ya I fear, however, that representations will be useless. The Government is quite alive to the situation, but it has neither money nor men. Under the old system a provincial governor kept order on the roads by putting each section under the care of a local headman, who was held responsible for its security, and if a case of robbery occurred the governor sent a handful of his retainers to exact a fine from the negligent official, and by this rough and ready system an energetic governor maintained security without much expense. But these primitive measures were displeasing to the Medjliss, and have been abolished in favour of a regularly organised force of road guards. Unfortunately, however, the road guards do not exist, or, in the few places wdiere there is a pretence of such a force, the men are unpaid, and naturally, in those circumstances, nothing efficient can be expected. The Treasury seems to be in serious straits. I am told that the deficit for the last two years is estimated by the Minister of Finance at 17 crores of tomans, or rather more than 1,500,00(F. The prospect of obtaining money in the near future is small. A necessary preliminary to any financial operation—except with the two Powers—is, of course, the conclusion of an agreement for the consolidation and service of the Government’s debts to the Russian Bank, and the Persian Government are showing little disposition to push forward the negotiations for this purpose. But, supposing that this difficulty is surmounted, there still remains the question of security for an advance, whether from the two Powers or from other sources. For an advance of so small an amount as 400,0001. security can be found, but there will be considerable haggling before any arrangement is reached, for the Persian Government have the most inflated ideas of the country’s credit. There is, of course, the possibility that the ^ projected internal loan will meet with a measure of success, but no one who is acquainted with the country has any faith in it, and the present state of insecurity is not calculated to reassure the native public. In such conditions the probability of the restoration of order on the southern roads in a reasonable period is slight, and I venture to suggest that the time has come when it is necessary to intimate clearly to the Persian Government that the prolonged interruption of British trade is intolerable, and that His Majesty’s Government will have to consider what measures they can take themselves to put a stop to it. ihe circumstances not only warrant, but demand, extremely plain speaking, if we are to bring it home to the ruling classes in Persia that they must put their house in order. For this purpose I would propose that the Persian Government should be informed that if, by the end of September, such a degree of security has not been established on the main trade routes in the south as to permit ordinary caravan traffic to be resumed, His Majesty’s Government will take the duty in hand themselves. This would stimulate the few who realise that, until European assistance, in the shape of adviseis and instructors, is enlisted, no progress towards reform and reorganisation is possible to enforce their views ; it would bring the Government and Medjliss face to lace with their desperate financial position, to wfiich at present they appear resolved to shut their eyes. -p It is quite possible that, under pressure of a threat of this kind, the rersian Government will find means to restore order. The successful efforts of Ypnm m Azerbaijan show what can be achieved when sufficient pressure is applied, and, now that Yprim has arrived in Tehran, his services might be used with equally good eilec in Fars. The one real difficulty is the money question, but the Government know quite well that for such a purpose they have only to apply to the two Governments, and they are only restrained from doing so by the insensate anti-Russian agitation o the ultra-Nationalists.

I SHOULD be glad if you wmild (after consultation with the Kussian Minister) give me your views as to the following proposals before I submit them to the Russian Government:— I presume you still think that there is little hope of the Persian Government applying to the two Powers of their own accord for money. In view of the fact, however, that unless they obtain money the situation will continue to grow worse and there will be little chance of quelling disorders, especially in Southern Persia, I think the two Powers might offer the Persian Government at once, on their own initiative and with no conditions beyond such as relate to repayment and security, an advance of 400,000k The offer of advance might be accompanied by an intimation that it is made on the understanding that it will be expended on the reorganisation of financial administration and on the restoration of order and security.

Gulahek, July 24, 1910. (Telegraphic.) YOUR telegram of 22nd July. Ihe Pei sian Government is certainly unlikely to apply to the two Powers for an advance at present. With iegard to the proposal to offer an advance spontaneously, I submit that the belief entertained and^ spread by the extreme Nationalists that the two Powers ait scheming to put financial fetters on Persia would be confirmed by such actionon our part. It is well known to the Persian Government that England and Russia are willing to make an advance without political conditions; it is only- hopes of obtaining money on easy terms raised by the propaganda of the Nationalist faction, who have sacrificed the interests of the country to their unjustified mistrust of the motives of the two Governments, which have prevented an application to us. I believe that the Persian Treasury are at present in such straits that if the Govern ment were given money very little of it would be devoted to restoring order in the country, and that an advance of 400,000L would not now be sufficient.

IT is inevitable that complete anarchy must soon result from the disorder which, according to the most recent reports from Tehran, is prevalent throughout the country, especially in the south, and is spreading rapidly. i t m Instances are numerous : the capture by robbers of a large British-Indian caiavan on the Yezd-Tabbas-Meshed road; the constant destruction by Afghan gun-runners of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s line m Seistan and the flight of the British staff to Robat; two mail robberies near Kum; an assault and robbery committed by armed men upon the Indo-European Telegraph Company s servants about 7 miles east of Tehran itself; outrages by the notorious Raib Hussein, lendeimg the Tehran-Ispahan road unsafe during June, and the state of the road between theie and Bushire, which has shown no sign of improvement since his arrival, and whic , as you know, has been the cause of serious losses to our trade and has long been scaicely PaSS Beside S these, there have been several cases of robbery in the immediate F 268 neighbourhood of Ispahan, and at Kermanshah, when the town was threatened by Kalhurs, the governor was forced to appeal to the Russian and British consulates to use their good offices to dissuade the tribe from attacking it, as he was left without any means of resistance.

MY telegram of 31st July. in mof L7im Sy n wftWindd°enf' ^Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 2.) Si r &gt; Gulaheh, Jidy 4, 1910. SARDAR ASSAD, the Minister of War, called on me on the 27th nltimo, when the expression of popular feeling excited by the nationalists against Russia over the recent incidents at Chargar and at Tabreez had reached its highest point, and asked me what I thought of the situation. I told his Excellency that observers well qualified to judge were asking themselves how long Russia would tolerate the campaign of malicious agitation that was being conducted against her in Tehran. As for myself, I could not understand the extraordinary folly of these people. Could they not realise that as Persia must have relations with Russia it was well that those relations should be good and friendly, and were they so insensate as to imagine that they could struggle against a Power whose armed forces alone were equal to one-third of the entire population of Persia ? And unfortunately the Government, instead of checking the pernicious clamour of that party, stood by and watched public opinion being infected by it. Why did not the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose special duty it was to foster good relations between Persia and her neighbours, protest in the Chamber against the campaign of the nationalists ? I had never seen in the accounts of the proceedings of the Medjliss a single occasion on which a voice had been raised against this suicidal agitation, and so far as I could learn the conduct of foreign relations was left entirely in the hands of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Medjliss. What possible chance was there of any Russian question obtaining a fair hearing from the committee, which never came into contact with the Russian Legation or with the British Legation, but which kept quite aloof from us, and sitting with closed doors probably worked itself up into hysterics over fancied wrongs. There must always be “ incidents ” between Russia and Persia; the great number of the, so to speak, “ floating ” population of doubtful or double nationality made that inevitable, and therefore it was the more necessary that every effort should be made towards minimising them, and he, Sardar Assad, could be quite sure that if these incidents were left to be settled by the Russian Legation and a competent Minister for Foreign Affairs, instead of being judged by a violently prejudiced irresponsible committee, the relations between Persia and Russia would speedily become amicable. Sardar Assad promised that he would make himself the advocate of a more conciliatory policy towards Russia. But, he continued, the obstacle was the prolonged presence of the Russian troops. I retorted by asking his Excellency why the Persian Government had made no reply to the intimation made by the Russian Minister about three weeks previously of the terms on which he was willing to negotiate for their withdrawal ? His Excellency said that the Cabinet crisis had prevented it, and went on to ventilate some of the grievances of Persia against Russia, but I cut short his tale of woe by saying he was doing exactly what I had tried to rvarn him against, namely, expatiating on Persian wrongs instead of going to discuss them with the Russian Minister, who would always meet him in a most conciliatory spirit. I told his Excellency that he only heard one-sided accounts, and thaUn the majority of cases he would probably find, if he would take the trouble to discuss matters with the Russian Legation, that, as in the Tabreez incident, the Persians were at least as much responsible as the Russians ; and as for the Russian Government, 1 could assure him that they desired good and intimately friendly relations with Persia no less tlictii ourselves* I have ventured to record this conversation at some length, as I think it will serve to depict fairly accurately the attitude of the Persian Government m Russian questions. I nn'U'P PvT* ’ CHARLES M. MARLING.Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received August 2.) Sirj Gulahek, July 12, 1910. ’ IN my telegram of the 30th ultimo, I had the honour to report that an insurrection of a somewhat serious nature had broken out in the piovince of Kermanshah. Daoud Khan, at the head of the Kalhur tribe, recently appeared with 1,800 men at Mahidasht, some 20 miles from Kermanshah, asserting that he hoped to arrange with the Governor-General the affairs of his tribe. In view of the grave situation in Luristan, where Sardar Akram has formed a coalition of tribes and threatens Kermanshah and Hamadan, the British acting consul and his Russian colleague pointed out to the Governor-General the desirability of Daoud’s Khan’s departure. His Excellency replied that he hoped to persuade the latter to withdraw in a few T days, but, failing success, he w'ould seek the consuls’ mediation. The Russian Minister and I thereupon instructed the two consuls, should the Nizam apply to them, to use their influence with Daoud, and to visit him if necessary. The Governor-General, however, made no application to the consulates, but on the 28th ultimo left the town and with his loyal Sinjabi force attacked Daoud. So far from realising his hope of inducing Daoud to withdraw, he was repulsed with heavy loss and returned to Kermanshah. The khan then informed the consuls that, having been thus wantonly attacked by the Nizam, he sought the aid of the two Powers to settle the matter in dispute ; he would accept any proposals they might make, and desired an interview with the Governor-General. Meanwhile his Excellency, without making any fresh overtures to the consuls, was showing marked signs of again taking precipitate action, and, to obviate the danger of such a course, the two consuls proposed a settlement by the payment of arrears of taxes and the limitation of Daoud’s activity to his own territory. M. Poklewsky and I have authorised the consuls to inform the Nizam of Daoud’s letter, and, subject to his Excellency’s concurrence, to try to arrange terms with Daoud, and, if necessary, by reason of the Nizam’s refusal to accept the consuls’ assistance, to advise him to submit to the Government. The Persian Government, to whom I did not fail to make representations in the sense of your telegram of the 30th ultimo, have informed me that Daoud has professed his loyalty to the central Government, and my latest information is to the effect that he has retired some 15 miles farther from Kermanshah. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. No. 143. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 2.) crxin-n t Gulahek, July 12, 1910. SINCE I wrote my despatch of the 2nd July the reports which I have received iiom Ilis Majesty s consul-general at Ispahan showed that the state of affairs on the roads converging at that city from Shiraz and Ahwaz was growing daily worse, and Mr. Grahame at last described the neighbourhood as being u terrorised by Kashgai robbers.” Having found that notes to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and verbal Minister of Interior or Minister of War are equally useless, the former being merely referred to the Medjliss Committee for Foreign Affairs and tie attei met with unfulfilled promises, it seemed to me necessary to take some other means oi forcing the attention of the Government to the necessity of restoring ^ j^erefore, as reported in my telegram of the 8th July, instructed ' . :)as Nun Khan, Nawab, to gain admittance to the next council of Ministers and gi\e them clearly to understand that His Majesty’s Government could not much longer a ^ mos f suspension of British trade. I enclose a memorandum by Abbas Kuli Khan of his interview with the Ministers, at which Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, tie presi ent of the Medjliss, was also present. Abbas Kuli Khan appears to have carried out his mission with great tact. I have some hopes that, although it seemspractically certain that the present Government will fall, the good impression will not he lost on their successors. But except under very strong pressure I am convinced that the Persian Government, whatever its composition may be, will do nothing. It is not that its members could not do something ; if they would employ the old-fashioned means the task is not one beyond their powers, but the general sense of the Medjliss is against that course, and is even more averse from the appointment of the men whose experience, acquired under the old regime, would ensure the success of those means. Even these objections might be surmounted if the Cabinet were in earnest. But unfortunately the Cabinet is much too occupied with its own internal squabbles and intrigues to look to the interests of the country, and until it receives a warning so serious that it cannot be disregarded, the same indifference to our protests and representations will continue On the morning of the 10th I received a report by telegraph from Mr. Grahame, the substance of which I forwarded to you in my telegram of the same day, that the presence of 200 to 300 Kashgais in the town and the intended departure of the governor and a considerable quantity of the troops at his disposal gave rise to some anxiety. As the Cabinet had once more tendered its resignation, I at once sent telegraphic messages to the under-secretaries at the Department of the Interior and for Foreign Affairs requesting that energetic measures should be taken for the maintenance of tranquillity in Ispahan; and having occasion the same afternoon to call on Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, I spoke to him very earnestly on the deplorable state of the southern provinces, and he promised to use his influence to restore security. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING, Enclosure in No. 143. Memorandum by Abbas Kuli Khan. BY Mr. Marling s instruction I proceeded to town yesterday to speak to the Cabinet about the increasing insecurity on the roads in Southern Persia. I found the Grand Vizier in the Parliament building. I informed his Excellency that I had come on the part of His Majesty’s charge d’affaires to put certain matters before the Cabinet. His Excellency ushered me into the adjacent room where all the Ministers were sitting. After the usual exchange of compliments, I asked leave to read out to them the 'notes which His Majesty’s charge d’affaires had written to the Persian Foreign Office about the deplorable situation in Southern Persia. Notwithstanding their protest that they had already seen the notes, I proceeded with the reading out of the last note of Mr. Marling’s, dated the 6th July. The Grand Vizier replied that if the present state in the northern provinces were to be compared with that of last year, it would be seen how much improvement was made, but in spite of that, the Russian and British Legations were always complaining at the slightest quarrel even between two individuals. I remarked that whatever might be the state of the northern provinces, the condition of the south was such that I did not believe that it could be tolerated much longer by His Majesty’s Government, who are constantly approached by the firms and traders doing business with Persia complaining of the increased insecurity in Southern Persia. What would be the ultimate result? I enquired. -Sardar Assad, Minister of War, at once replied that the Persian Government highly appreciates the friendliness hitherto shown by His Majesty’s Government in avoiding to make a military demonstration in the country. Of course, his Excellency said, 200 Indian sepoys would have restored order in Southern Persia. To show their oratitude, I said, the Persian Government should take some steps to relieve His Majesty’s’ Government of their anxiety by restoring order on the trade routes. Sardar Assad replied that, with regard to the Kashgai brigands near Ispahan, the Bakhtiaris have been ordered to pursue and punish them, but with regard to the disorder in Ears, a radical change in the administration of that province is indispensable, and that the Cabinet is now engaged in discussing the matter, the result of which would be communicated to His Majesty’s Legation in the form of a reply to its notes addressed to the Foreign Office on the subject. . . ^ The Sardar added that when I spoke to him some time ago m support ot tlie Soulet-ed-Dowleh he did not fail to point out to me that the Soulet was unwort y. 1 renlied that His Majesty’s Legation has never supported Soulet or any other person, but I, in accordance with my instructions, only urged upon the Persian Government- m72 a private and friendly manner the necessity of avoiding any conflict between the Sonlet and his brother, the Zaygham-ed-Dowleh, which might lead to serious complications in the south. . . x T . • n I may add that in the course of conversation the Grand Vizier referred to the force at the disposal of the Governor-General of lars for the purpose of beeping order in his province. X could not help remarking that governors did not alwaj s use the force at their disposal in the right way, hut sometimes for theii peisonal interest, and that the Cabinet was, no doubt, a better judge as to whether that was the case with the present Governor-General of Fars. With regard to the trouble in the neighbourhood of Kermanshah, the Cabinet informed me that Daoud Khan had already telegraphed his allegiance to the Persian Government, and that there was no ground for any anxiety as to the safety of foreigners in that town. ABBAS KULI. July 8, 1910. No. 144. Mr, Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 2.) Sir, Gulahek, July 15, 1910. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of the principal events that have occurred in Persia during the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. CHABLES M. MARLING Enclosure in No. 144. Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending July 15, 1910. Tehran. THE Cabinet was dissolved shortly after the resignation on the 7th July of the president of the Medjliss, and on the 14th July, when Sipahdar and Sardar Assad were elected to be deputies, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek announced that he had been entrusted by the Regent with the formation of a new Cabinet. On the 1st July Yprim Khan (Davidian) and Sardar Bahadur arrived at Tehran from Azerbaijan, bringing with them a number of prisoners captured in the recent expedition they led in those parts. The Medjliss. On the 14th June the regulations and conditions for an internal loan of 1,000,000/. at 7 per cent, interest, repayable in twenty annual instalments, guaranteed by the Crown lands and passport revenues, were passed by the House. At the sitting of the 16th June the renewal for four years of the contract of M. Mornard, the Belgian Director of Customs, at a salary of 50,000 fr. a-year was approved. One of the deputies, however, seized the opportunity to make an attack on M. Mornard. On the 21st June the report of the War Office and Budget Committees regarding the proposed purchase of 30,000 rifles of the latest pattern was read. It was decided to send a delegation of three persons to Europe to make enquiries on the subject. On the 23rd June a committee was elected to inspect the accounts of the Ministry of Finance. It is understood, however, that the intention was to examine the accounts of the Customs Administration. _On the 25th June the Budget Committee’s report dealing with the proposal of the Minister of the Interior to purchase 50,000 Mauser pistols was read. Taki Zade used this as an opportunity to make a long speech strongly criticising the Government’s policy. He pointed out the danger of passing isolated proposals of this nature before the budget had been presented to the House. The sitting of the 29th June was remarkable on account of the insubordination of one of the members to the president, who, in order to enforce his authority, left theHouse. The incident showed that the president’s popularity was greatly on the wane. He had always attempted to shield the Cabinet, at any rate at public sittings, but on the 2nd July he was unable to hold back the deputies any^ longer.^ Sheikh Ismail Hashtroudi began by giving an account of his conversations^ with some of the Cabinet Ministers respecting the attitude of Ilussia. He^ led his hearers to understand that the Medjliss was so displeased with the Cabinet Ministers that if they were not afraid of their intrigues they would immediately pass a vote of censure against them. This speech, the first of its kind to be delivered at a public sitting, was followed by others of a similar tendency. ■ „ i At this sitting three months’ leave of absence asked for by d aki Zade was granted to him. This move on Taki Zade’s part was brought about by the action of the Ulema of Nejef, who telegraphed to the Regent, the Cabinet, and the Assembly urging the deputy’s removal owing to his alleged revolutionary and irre igious tendencies. He has, however, not yet left. ^ . In consequence of an attempt to discredit Vekil-ul-Roaya, the deputy who was attached to the Ministry of Finance and successfully conducted the negotiations with the Imperial Bank for the mint contract and the consolidation of the floating debt, a committee was elected to examine his accounts relating to the forced subscriptions leyiec from the Zil-es-Sultan and others. At the sitting of the 2nd instant the committee read their report and Vekil-ul-Roaya subsequently made a speech. On the 5th July further attacks were made on the Cabinet, arid on the 7th the president of the Mediliss, Mustashar-ed-Dowleh, tendered his resignation which was accepted by the House without comment. Zoka-ul-Mulk was elected to replace him. On the Uth July Sipahdar and Sardar Assad attended, and were elected deputies by a maiority, in the place of members who have resigned, as provided m the Electoral Law. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek announced that the Regent had entrusted him with t e formation of a Cabinet, which he hoped soon to present to the House. Both Sipahdar and Sardar Assad addressed the House in suitable terms, reminding the members ot their entry into Tehran a year ago, assuring them of their complete dismteiesredness, and promising to support the nation in the task before them. These words were received with loud cheers. . Tabreez. The situation in Azerbaijan has remained normal. JResht. The Government troops under Yprim and Sardar Bahadur, who have been employed at Ardebil, passed through Resht on their way to Tehran in ^e middle of June/ They had with them fifty-nine Shahsevan prisoners, including the leading chief, Amir-i-Ashayer. Meshed. The state of the province continues tranquil, but the administration leaves much to be desired, owing partly to the multiplication of offices by the Persian Government which renders it difficult for the various officials to know what duties they are expected to perform and where their respective responsibilities begin and end. The provincial assembly is a body devoid of either influence or resources, and its power m local politics may be said to be nil. Seistan. 1. The province is generally tranquil, though Afghan gun-runners have rendered the Seistan-Kuh-i-Malik Siah road unsafe. The revenue is being collected by t e Gustoms and is coming in slowly. The village headmen complain bitterly to the Cu toms against the governor, and declare that unless something is done to improve their c/ndilon they wiU be forced to seek protection in one of the consulates, or, failing that, to nmve mtoyfgha Dehaneh and Kuh-i-Malik Siah was repeatedly f T 6 A? A Ff 0 .h a n nun-runners during June. An arms caravan accompanied ifmtfthaL Lfft Bal^h 17?o/ards thf end of June. This was believed to be 7 i i J+u ori fUp ] ith July another caravan was reported to be near the last ^e season but “lU/ gim-runners plundered theAritish rest-house and 1 the'Persian^Customs official’s house at Girdichab. Their caravan consisted of 50074 to 600 camels, most of whose loads were arms, and was accompanied by 150 armed men. Birjand merchants have taken steps to have their goods stopped at Kuh-i-Malik Siah until the road is safe. The Indo-European Telegraph Department employes are also at Kuh-i-Malik Siah. In spite of urgent representations, the Persian Government have done nothing to stop the gun-runners, Ispahan. The condition of Ispahan town has continued normal. The local assembly meets regularly, but does not appear to transact much business. The roads to Ispahan were safe during the first half of June, but during the latter half the Shiraz, Ahwaz, and Sultanabad roads were reported unsafe, and several robberies occurred. On the Sultanabad road the robberies were the work of Lurs, who appear to have been raiding extensively. They plundered the posts and killed several persons. The robberies on the Shiraz and Ahwaz roads were committed within a radius of 30 miles of Ispahan, and appear all to have been the work of Kashgais, against whom the Bakhtiari Governor-General seemed disinclined to take any measures. According to latest reports Soulet-ed-Dowleh is at Kumisheh, to which place Aga Norullah has gone to meet him. Meanwhile, some 200 Kashgais have assembled in Ispahan itself. The Persian Government, however, state that there is no reason for disquietude on account of the movements of the Kashgais. Telegraphing on the 13th July, Mr. Grahame reported that caravans had come into Ispahan unmolested on the 12th and 13th, and that an emissary from Soulet-ed-Dowleh. had also arrived. On the Tehran road the posts have been at times interfered with. This is attributed to the followers of ISTaib Hussein of Kashan. Naib Hussein apparently had to leave Kashan when reinforce ments for the Government troops arrived. He was followed and attacked, and lost two killed and sixteen prisoners. On the 11th July his men robbed the post from Tehran near Khafr, killing three Bakhtiari passengers and taking off fourteen post horses. Yezd. The town has remained quiet. A good deal of opposition has been displayed against certain officials sent from Tehran to institute taxes on certain articles such as opium and firewood, owing to the fact that these articles are already taxed in Yezd by the governor. The latter appears to have supported, if he did not instigate, the opposition. The officials concerned have referred the matter to Tehran. At Nain the attempt to impose these taxes led to a crowd assembling in the British telegraph office and demanding redress from the Governor of Yezd. The question was referred to Tehran, and the tax on opium is now being collected without trouble. The condition of the roads has been normal, though on the Kerman road exaggerated accounts of a robbery near Bafsinjan made muleteers nervous as to the safety of the road. A specie caravan of the Imperial Bank of Persia reached Kerman in safety. The Parsees having failed to obtain a satisfactory reply to their appeal to Tehran in the case of the endowment house, mentioned in last summary, there has been a crop of cases in which Mahommedans question the correctness of contracts, leases, &amp;c., of Parsees. Kerman. The country generally is disturbed, and no road can be said with confidence to oe safe, as the local authorities are unable to maintain order. His Majesty’s consul thinks t hat things are not likely to improve now that Kawam-ul-Mulk has left the province. The arrival of Sardar-i-Jang may have a good effect, but it is not likely to restore order all at once throughout this large province. On the 10th July a party of 500 Ears robbers had surrounded Sirjan, where fighting was in progress. They had also plundered a post, burning tbe letters. The people of Rafsinjan were much alarmed. Shiraz. The general situation in Ears shows no improvement. The Governor-General appears to be incapable, and, having used the Kawamis and Zaygham-ed-Dowleh to weaken Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s power, he has now alienated the former and will probably alienate the latter. Meanwhile he has to some extent restored Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s power, and the only trade routes on which any traffic has taken place to Ispahan and Bushire are those which Soulet-ed-Dowleh insists on being used and for which he75 provides guards. He is reported to be at Kumisheh, which is not in Ears but in the province of Ispahan. There seems little hope of any improvement in the situation until a capable governor is appointed. Persian Gulf. Bushire. The Governor-General, Darya Hegi, was in the middle ol June still at Bunder Abbas. The local assembly at Bushire had almost ceased to exist, only two members of the six elected being still at Bushire. The question ot a fresh election for tlm assembly had been referred to Tehran. Considerable uncertainty as to the safety of the roads to Shiraz and as to the road to be used seems to have existed during Hay and June. In the latter part of May Assistant Surgeon Kelly was able to travel safely to Shiraz, Soulet-et-Dowleh arranging for his safe passage. On the 5th June it was reported at Bushire that Soulet-ed-Dowleh had telegraphed to one of the Tangistain chiefs that henceforth caravans would use the Firuzabad road, and that he would e held responsible for the safety of caravans passing through the country controlled by him The chief in question, Zayer Khudder, was reported to have offered the new Governor-General of Ears 800L in the hope that caravans would be allowed to use the road passing through his jurisdiction, and that he would be given control of the port ot Dilwar, the principal resort of smugglers.

Saint-Petersbourg, le 20 juin (3 juillet), 1910. (Translation.) AYITH reference to the aide-memoire of the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 3rd (16th) June, the British Embassy has the honour to inform the Imperial Ministry that the British Government agree that, in the event of the Persian Govern ment applying to the two Governments for an advance, that advance should be secured on the entire customs revenues, of the north as well as the south of Persia • provided however, that none of the southern revenues shall be applied to the service of the new advance until the service of the Anglo-Indian loans and the debts of the Imperial jan v lave been fully discharged, and that separate accounts be kept as regards the payment of interest and sinking fund on the old loans and on the new advance respectively. His Majesty’s Government are quite ready to support the Imperial Government in their opposition to the free importation of silver, and share the view of the Imperial government that it is desirable to leave the two representatives to choose the proper moment for informing the Persian Government that the two Powers agree to advance the sum m question. &amp; St. Peter sburgh, June 20 {July 3), 1910.Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 5.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 5, 1910. MY telegram of 3rd August. Government have issued a proclamation for the surrender of arms possessed by unauthorised persons within forty-eight hours. It is doubtful how far it will be obeyed, and the Government is not in a position to enforce it, as they cannot count upon the Bakhtiaris, and the Cossack brigade have scarcely 400 effectives in Tehran. Fedais are divided into two factions : firstly, those identified with the murderers of Seyyid Abdul; and, secondly, those who murdered Taki Zade’s nephew, and who pose as championing the popular demand for the punishment of Seyyid s assassins. These latter are headed by Sattar and Bagher Khans. . , At a meeting held yesterday they decided not to disarm until certain demands were complied with, most important being dissolution of the Cabinet.

I am reluctant to commit His Majesty’s Government to a policy of intervention on the scale proposed, but prefer to insist, in the first instance, on the formation of a body of road-guards of some 1,000 or 1,200 men, levied and officered by eight or ten officers of the Indian army lent by the Government of India, in the hope that this measure may prove sufficient to attain the object in view. I have to request you to explain to the Russian Government the nature of the scheme, and to propose to them that, when making the representation suggested in my telegram above referred to, the two representatives should insist on its acceptance by the Persian Government.

Immediately after this twenty or thirty Persian Cossacks from Nizam-es- Snltaneh’s camp arrived, dispersed the soldiers, and beat the aggressor. He is now under arrest in the governor’s house. Very shortly afterwards Samsam-ul-Mamalek, commander of cavalry, the Rais-i-Kushun, and several civil dignitaries called to offer apologies and to see that the Russian consul was effectively guarded. Some fifty men, Persian Cossacks and soldiers of the Hamadan regiment stationed here, were posted in the garden, and at night horsemen patrolled the neighbouring ground. During this day and the next no disturbance took place. Small groups, however, of the Kerendi soldiers passing before the house shouted insults at M. Lissowski. On the afternoon of the 25th Nizam-es-Sultaneh called on the Russian consul and gave every apology and assurance for the future, promising the same day to disband the regiment. He nevertheless warned him that the Russian Cossacks should not for the present appear in the streets. Next morning I received a note from my Russian colleague, saying that he hoped that the matter was near settlement. On the evening of the same day I called on him and found that the situation had grown still more serious. He had that afternoon been on his verandah with the officer commanding the guards whom Nizam-es-Sultaneh had sent, when one of three Kerendis passing by aimed his rifle at him. The man was seized by Persian Cossacks before he could fire, and is now under arrest. Further insulting demonstrations were made before the house. My Russian colleague seemed now determined that if this state of affairs did not immediately cease he would forthwith leave Kermanshah wdth his escort as a protest. I did all in my power to dissuade him from this step, and offered, pending a reply from his Government, to exert independently all possible pressure on Nizam-es- Sultaneh to obtain the instant disarmament of the Kerendi regiment and the introduc tion of fresh troops, in order to assure a proper maintenance of public security. My Russian colleague cordially accepted my proposal. I consequently telegraphed what steps I proposed to take, and early next morning addressed a strong note to the governor, requesting immediate disarmament and the introduction of fiesh ti oops, and stating as my reason for this demand that, since such disorder prevailed that the life of the Russian consul was threatened, I had no possible guarantee of the safety of British subjects. I closely followed up my note by a visit to the governor, accompanied by Persian Cossacks, whom he had sent of his own movement to escort me. I began by telling him that, if he were willing to treat me with complete fiankness and confidence, and receive my advice in the same friendly spirit in which it was given, a solution might be found for this unpleasant affair. I informed him that the Russian consul was determined at the first recurrence of these disorders to quit his post as a protest, and that the consequences of this step would be as serious for himself as for the future of Persia. replied denying that any insult had been offered to the Russian consul or his flag, and stated firmly that no attempt had been made on his life. I was fortunately able to repeat almost verbatim the statement of my Russian colleague to Nizam-es- Sultaneh s “ munsln-bashi,” which I had heard the night before. I then pointed out that his words were belied by his^ own actions ; that he had sent troops to quell the fust disorders and officers and officials to apologise; that he had himself made excuses to M Lissowski and warned him that the streets were not safe for his Cossacks • and that he had that morning taken the unusual step of sending horsemen to escort me I further entreated him very amicably to abandon this attitude and deal openly with me but was again met by the same stolid denial. He even offered to hold a meeting with M. Lissowski and myself when the officer of the guards whom he had sent to the Russian consul could be examined as to the facts. I replied assuring him that complete frankness existed between the two consulates, and that the time was uast when a provincial governor in Persia could hope to gain his own ends by stirring up suspicion between the British and Russian consuls, and told him that I was not come to test the veracity of my colleague, but to exact the execution of his duty as Governor towards the representatives and subjects of foreign Powers. Thereon he gave me the fullest assurances that he would disarm and disband immediately the companv of 100 men to which the man killed had belonged, and that he would do his utmost to dismiss the remainder of the regiment and replace it without delay. • I i tlien w ent ^ irectl y. t0 Russian consul, and informed him of the governor’s attitude. My colleague immediately sent for the officer in question, who on our requesting him to relate what had happened, entirely confirmed the details’reported above. .The Persian guards of this consulate, who belong to the same regiment on independent examination by my “ mirza,” further confirmed this accountAt 3 o’clock on tlie same afternoon one company of the Kerendis was paid off and disarmed. Later they were escorted outside the town. I have addressed no further communication to the governor, and await your instructions as to my attitude towards him. This morning I have received an official reply to my note. Nizam-es-Sultaneh states in this communication that complete order prevails, and that no insults have been offered to foreign subjects or consulates. He nevertheless gives me cognisance of the disarmament of the company of Kerendis, and informs me of his plans for dismissing and replacing the remainder. On the whole the outlook is more hopeful to-day, but the governor’s incongruous attitude does not appear likely to mend the situation, and I am afraid that it is impossible to persuade him to desist from his absurd denials. Apart from this, Nizam-es-Sultaneh has done all in his power, and that with great promptitude, in the matter of supplying my colleague with a strong guard. Feeling against foreigners in general is pronounced. I think, however, that, after the governor’s action in dismissing part of the troops, there is little likelihood of a further attempt against the Russian consul. Since yesterday afternoon the telegraph has been interrupted. An urgent telegram reporting the results of my interview could not be sent yesterday, nor has my Russian colleague yet received a reply to his message reporting the renewed disorders. M. Lissowski, who during four days has been subjected to a continual nervous strain, has throughout acted with great moderation. On some occasions the guards have with difficulty been restrained from firing on the soldiers outside, and no rash action has been taken. I have, &amp;c. G. G. KNOX. No. 159. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 29.) Sir^ Gulahek, August 11, 1910. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual summary of events in Tehran and the provinces during the past four weeks. The state of affairs in the south has not, 1 regret to say, been materially improved, though there was a short period at the end of last month when the security on the Shiraz-Ispahan road was better. The Ahvvaz- Ispahan road is, however, now fairly safe. I have constantly urged the Persian Government to take effective measures to restore order in Fars, but the Cabinet crisis and, since the formation of a new Government, the difficulties which have beset Ministers in Tehran have prevented anything being done yet, but I hope that the recall of Zaffer-es-Sultaneh, of whose incompetence I have had to complain so often, from the governorship of Fars indicates that the Government intend at last to take the question seriously in hand. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 159. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending August 11, 1910. Tehran. SEYYID ABDULLAH, the principal mujtehed of Tehran, a priest whose reputation was not good and who had taken a prominent part throughout in the constitutional movement, was murdered in his house on the night ot Friday, the 15th July, by a band of men who took no pains to hide their identity. They were “ fedai,” and the murder was clearly a political one, intended to impress the party he was supposed to have sided with, or at any rate to put an end to his alleged intrio-ues against a section of the Nationalists. The party of whom Taki Zade was one of the most prominent members was held responsible for the outrage, and shortly afterwards Taki Zade was forced to leave the country. The murder created [716] G82 considerable stir in the capital, and a large number of merchants and others collected at one of the principal moscjues of Tehran with the object of pressing the authorities to, capture the murderers. . 1 On the 25th July the new Cabinet, which had in the meantime been formed with considerable difficulty, was presented to the Medjliss by the Premier, Mustaufi-ul- Mamalek. It was composed as follows :— Minister of the Interior ... Minister of Foreign Affairs Minister of Finance Minister of War ... Minister of Justice Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Farman Farma. Hussein Kuli Khan, C.B. Hakim-ul-Mulk. Kawam-es-Sultaneh. Dabir-ul-Mulk. Assadullah Mirza. On the 1st instant a second outrage was committed by the “ fedai, but this time by a section of them apparently hostile to the ultra-Nationahsts, for one of the victims was Mirza Ali Mohammed Khan, nephew of Taki Zade. This was looked upon as a reprisal for the murder of the Mujtehed Seyyid Abdullah. The new Cabinet thereupon'considered the desirability of disarming the “fedai” responsible for these outrages and for the insecurity so generally felt. A proclamation was issued on the 5th instant calling upon the “ fedai to disarm, but they replied by collecting under the leadership of Sattar Khan—the defender of Tabreez at the park of the late Atabeg, and by formulating certain demands. This state of affairs lasted until the 7th instant, when the Government decided to use force against them. At 2-30 p.m. on the 7th instant an unforeseen exchange of shots at the park gates between a “ fedai ” and some Bakhtiari opened active hostilities between Sattar Khan’s supporters and the Government forces. Guns were brought up to points commanding the park walls, which are in close proximity to His Majesty’s Legation, and a considerable amount of ammunition was expended on both sides. Eventually after nightfall a breach was made in the wall in the direction of the French Legation, by which the Bakhtiari entered, taking Sattar Khan prisoner, together with Bagher Khan, who had joined him, and the whole of their following, some 300 men, including a number of unarmed merchants. Sattar Khan was wounded in the fighting, and about eighteen “ fedai ” were killed at the loopholes and about forty wounded. The Government casualties are said to have been seven killed and twenty-three wounded. The Bakhtiari were prominent in the fighting under Sardar Bahadur, the eldest son of Sardar Assad; and Yprim, the Armenian chief of police, was foremost on the Government side. The “ fedai ” showed very little resistance, chiefly due, no doubt, to their unpreparedness and to the nature of the ground, which is little adapted to defence. Two days later Sardar Mohy (Moez-es-Sultan), another leader of “ fedai,” closely connected with the ex-Prime Minister Sipahdar, took refuge with his following at the Turkish Embassy in the country, and it seems as if, for the present, this element of disorder in Tehran has received a severe lesson, and that the prestige' of the new Government is likely to be enhanced thereby. The public proceedings of the Medjliss during the past four weeks do not call for any special report, as they were not of any particular interest. Most of the important business of the House was conducted in secret as usual. Nasr-ul-Mulk left for Europe at the end of July. Tabreez. It appears that the Governor of Maragha not long ago arrested the officers of a small force of armed police sent there by the Governor-General and had them beaten. The latter is said to contemplate sending a strong force to punish the offenders. Mr. Stevens thinks that the local governor, who is a reactionary, will prove too strong for this. • &lt; Meshed. Ptukn-ed-Dowleh, who was dismissed from the post of Governor-General, has, in consequence^ of ministerial changes at Tehran, remained at his post. The local commander-in-chief returned early in July from his abortive expedition to the western frontier of Khorassan. He accomplished nothing, and fresh robberies were reported near Jurbat, six travellers being said to be killed. The eastern frontier ;of Khorassan was also said to be in a disturbed state, A large band of robbers,consisting of Kakaris, Jamshidis, and Afghans, was established near Zorabad under one Mangul Khan, Kakari, and had committed several robberies, one being that of a large caravan, the property of Kussian subjects, bringing sugar to Meshed, Prince Dabija protested strongly, and the Persian authorities promised to take measures to suppress the brigands. A good deal of friction seems to exist between the local police and local governors, notably at Bujnurd, Kuchan, Sarakhs, and Birjand, The interference of the police is said to exercise a bad effect on the general administration, this support that be expressed his willingness to pay compensation for all robberies committed by Kashgais recently in the Ispahan district. There is reason to believe that many of these robberies were not committed by Kasbgais, but by Bakhtiaris and Chabar Mabalis, instigated thereto by Amir-i-Mufakham, who covets the governorship of Ispahan and seeks to discredit Sardar-i-Asbjaa. Zaygham-ed-Dowleh has been in the Bakbtiari country since the middle of July. Early in August fighting between Bakhtiaris and Kasbgais was reported to have taken place some 30 miles south-west of Kumisheh, but this has not yet been confirmed. Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s emissary stated to both the Governor-General and the local assembly that bis master’s intentions were pacific, and that he was a staunch and loyal constitutionalist. The emissary, Moavin-ul- Mamalek, visited His Majesty’s consul-general, and enquired why His Majestyfi legation bad vetoed the appointment of Soulet-ed-Dowleh to the governorship of the Gulf ports. Mr. Grahame, in returning his visit, delivered a message from His Majesty’s charge d’affaires comparing the protests of friendship made by him on behalf of his master with the latter’s acts. On the 11th July the post from Tehran was robbed by Naib Hussein s men near Imamzadeh, but apart from this the road has remained safe. On the whole, there has of late been an improvement in the condition of the principal southern routes, but a certain insecurity still exists on the Yezd and Sultanabad roads. It is possible that the recent improvement may perhaps he attributed to the desire of Soulet-ed- Dowleh to figure well in the eyes of His Majesty’s Legation and of the public ; in the same way, the insecurity now prevailing on some roads may be ascribed in great measure to bands of Kashgais who are out of the control of their chief. On the 6th August 100 camels were carried off by Kashgais at the very gate of Ispahan. 1. Sardar-i-Jung has not yet left to take up the governorship of Kerman, though his nephew, Sarum-ul-Mulk, who, it was said, would succeed him at Yezd, has been there for some time now. The Ispahan road has been unsafe at times. The Imperial Bank of Persia has forwarded large amounts of specie to Yezd recently. Ibis has somewhat troubled the postal authorities, who are very short of horses at their stages. The tax on opium is now being levied, but the other proposed new taxes remain m abeyance. At Nain those on salt and opium are being levied after a reference by the people to Tehran. Merchants in Yezd are reported to be ordering goods, particularly cloth, through agents at Tehran, owing to the practical blockac e fix* TwnfAQ Ttiift diminishes the demand for local productions and lor and the collection of revenue is said to be retarded in consequence. The chief of police at Meshed is accused of having amassed money illegally, and is losing favour all round. Ispahan. The chief features in the situation have been the arrival of some 300 Kashgais at Ispahan and the despatch by Soulet-ed-Dowleh from Kumisheh of an emissary to the Governor-General. The object of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s negotiations with Sardar-i- Ashjaa appears to be to gain the support of that section of the Bakhtiaris to which the latter belongs, while the rival section is supporting Zaygham-ed-Dowleh in his efforts to retain the allegiance of the Kashgais. So anxious is Soulet-ed-Dowleh for Yezd. animals and arms from the mha hearing of Naib H ussein s approac house was pillaged (t,p,d a cam van robbed. Naib Hussein visited the British telegraph G 2 [716]84 office and enquired about the state of things at Yezd. One of his sons subsequently came to the office and, despite the refusal of the signaller on duty to give up his two rifles, took them, but paid him 12Z., which was some 5l. less than their value. On the 17th Naib Hussein, hearing that forces were moving against him from Natanz and Ispahan, left for Zavareh. His Majesty’s acting vice-consul at Yezd informed the governor of Naib Hussein’s movements. The Sardar thereupon sent a telegram to Naib Hussein daring him to come on to Yezd, but as he mentioned that he had heard of his movements from the telegraph officials, and as a son of Naib Husseins had already declared that his father owed them a grudge for reporting his movements, and would pay them out, the telegram was not delivered. It appears that Naib Hussein was in correspondence with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. On the 2nd August Naib Hussein was at Anarek, where some fighting took place in which he was successful. He was, however, compelled to retire owing to want of forage. A force of Bakhtiaris is said to be in pursuit of him. Kermanshah. 1. Daoud Khan, Kalhur, who had on the 7 th July withdrawn to Harunabad, returned on the 15th to Mahidasht, still accompanied by a large force, but with the avowed intention of making his submission to the governor. He camped 5 miles outside the town, and next morning, after closely surrounding the governor’s camp with a large number of horsemen, he proceeded himself to the governor’s tent. The interview, which took place under the rifles of Daoud Khan’s bodyguard, was brief and unsatisfactory. Daoud Khan, after making the customary gestures of submission, replied to a question of the governor that he had not taken this step earlier for fear of treachery, and was then dismissed. His Majesty’s acting consul and his Bussian colleague, seeing that Daoud Khan was acting so high-handedly and with such open distrust of the governor, decided to make to the latter the communication they had already been authorised to make by their respective legations. The governor replied thanking them for their communication, and informing them that Daoud Khan had now made his submission, and he hoped a peaceful settlement was assured. The two consuls then wrote to Daoud Khan, who had previously applied to them, that they had referred his application to their legations, and, having received their reply, they had informed the governor of his letter, expressing to him the hope that the questions at issue would be settled without further bloodshed. They hoped an amicable solution was assured, and advised him to accept whatever conditions the governor offered. 2. Kermanshah, except for an incident arising out of the shooting of a Persian soldier by a Bussian Cossack which has already been fully reported upon, has remained quiet, though there has been some firing at night, one man being killed and two or three policemen wounded. Much feeling exists against local Government institutions at Kermanshah, Burujird, and Senneh. On the 15th July some Kurds bringing in fruit were robbed 24 miles from Kermanshah, one man being killed. Hamadan. On the 11th July the bazaars wnre closed as a protest against the collection of the salt tax ^ and octroi. The former is especially obnoxious, as much salt is used in the tanning industry here. On the 12th there was an orderly demonstration, but on the 13th the demonstrators were joined by roughs. The windows of the shop of a German chemist were broken after he had been warned to close his shop and had refused to do so. A crowd met the cashier of the Bussian Bank, a Bussian, and beat him. He was apparently hit with sticks as he walked through the crowd, but not hard enough to damage him. Mr. McMurray, of the Imperial Bank of Persia, met a similar crowd armed with sticks the same day, but it made way for him and saluted him. The Bussian telegraphed to Tehran, but was later reported 'to have accepted an apology from the ciowd. The same day the crowd went to the seat of the local government, and, crying out that they wanted the bricks and mortar they had contributed last year for the building, pulled down a pillar or two and took away the furniture. The Jews and Armenians shut themselves up in their houses. The bazaars remained closed until the 16th, when news of the death of Seyyid Abdullah was telegraphed from Tehran with permission to celebrate the funeral. This was done very quietly, and the bazaars were reopened. The news seemed to calm the town, while the priests went to Amir-i-Afkham in great trepidation. On the 19th the governor, Sardar-i-Nasser, who had spent the last four months in a garden outside the town, entered the town with 200 men. His appearance had a good effect, and the taxes were paid. Amir-i-Afkham, a man of greatlocal influence, is widely accused of* having fomented the disturbances. There is little security ; the police, who were badly paid, disappeared completely during the disturb ances. In the town robberies take place every night, and one post was robbed within 4 miles of the town. Kerman. The province is still without a governor, and Nusrat-us-Sultan, the deputy governor, is described as being incompetent, obstructive, and obnoxious to the local assembly and the people. In the middle of July the local assembly adjourned its meetings as a protest against the arbitrary proceedings of the deputy governor. Persian Baluchistan was reported to be entirely beyond the control of the local government of Kerman. Some thirty Baluchis from Sarhad attacked Naimabad, a village near Fahraj, on the 12th July and carried off seventy camels and much other plunder, killing one camel-man. It was also reported that Kundil Khan with 100 men had plundered Isfandaga and Mehni, The band of Ears robbers mentioned in last summary was attacked by a combined force of police and Afshars and were put to flight, losing twelve killed and eleven prisoners. Much plunder was recovered from them. Though the Shiraz-Kerman road is the only one still closed, the roads cannot be said to be safe. Shiraz. The situation appears to be that the Governor-General, acting under the orders of Sipahdar while still Minister of the Interior, completely re-established Soulet-ed-Dowleh's power m Fars. Several local governorships have been given to the latter s adherents, and a large part of the Kashgais who had gone over to Zayghaim-ed-Dowleh have returned to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Zaygham-ed-Dowleh was appointed Governor of Behbehan, but informed the central Government that, owing to the difficulties created for him in his own tribe by Zaffar-es-Sultaneh, he could not take up the post. Zaffer-es-Sultaneh requested Soulet-ed-Dowleh to send 800 Kashgais to Shiraz to be at his disposal for administrative purposes, and over 100 have arrived, under command of a notorious robber. His Majesty’s consul was officially notified by the Governor-General that from the 8 th July the Government of Kazerun had accepted responsibility for the telegraph route to Bushire, but as Soulet-ed-Dowleh is known to oppose its use, caravans are afraid to use it. The people at large are much disgusted at the re-establishment of Soulet-ed- Dowleh’s power. The Kawamis and Zaygham-ed-Dowleh are in communication and are encouraged by Sardar-i-Assad. On the 6th July Zaygham-ed-Dowleh was requested by telegraph by Sardar-i-Zaffer to proceed to the Bakhtiari country “ with or without forces. The telegram ended : “ It is quite certain Soulet will be utterly suppressed. Zaygham- ed-Dowleh is reported to have gone, but with only fifty horsemen. The Firuzabad road to Bushire appears to be quite safe, but no one seems to have much confidence in the Ispahan road, on which several robberies, including some of posts, are reported. On the former road muleteers are subjected to much extortion. On the 9th August it was announced at Tehran that Zaffer-es-Sultaneh has been dismissed from the governorship of Fars. Persian Gulf. Bushire. The post to Shiraz was robbed on the 26th June between Kazerun and Mian Kotal. No. 160. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 29.) gj r Gulaheh, August 11, 1910. THE Cabinet whose formation I had the honour to report in my despatch of to-day’s date had been in office but a few days when it was called on to deal with the very difficult question of the disarmament of the fedais and mujteheds, a measure the necessity of which was imposed by the perpetration, on the 1st instant ot tlie three political murders reported in my telegram of the 2nd instant. lhat these crimes were purely political is proved by the fact that one of the victims, Mnza i Mohammed Khan, a nephew of Taki Zade, received some warning, and he consequent y went only a few hours before he met his fate to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs \dX O86 that lie and two others were threatened. Mirza Ali Mohammed was shot by a party of fedais in a tea-house in one of the busiest streets of the town, and three or four .other persons were wounded by the reckless shooting, but no attempt was made to arrest the criminals. The next evening the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ house w T as visited by fedais, but fortunately his Excellency was absent, or he w r ould undoubtedly have been killed. These crimes were evidently reprisals for the murder of Seyyid Abdullah, and it seemed as though political warfare in Tehran was to be carried on by the revolvers of assassins, who were constituting themselves the champions of the rival parties. The state of affairs was becoming intolerable, and the Government began to talk of a general disarmament of the fedais and mujtehids, who were both an expense and a danger to the State. The Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned the proposed action to the Russian Minister at the review on the 2nd instant, and when I joined in the conversation, M. Poklewski was giving it his cordial approval, particularly urging the arrest of the murderers of Seyyid Abdullah. As the Russian Minister and 1 had already talked over the matter, and agreed that we ought to encourage the Government, I expressed similar views, though I rather urged the superior importance of disarming the fedais, as it seemed to me that the arrest of the assassins and the expulsion of the foreign fedais would be a comparatively simple matter when the disarming had taken place. From what the Nawab said it was clear that the Ministers were apprehensive lest if the fedais should make any serious resistance, the Russian Government should make it a pretext to bring troops from Kazvin to Tehran, and he was obviously relieved when M. Poklewski assured him that there was not, and never had been, any wish on the part of the Russian Government to find a pretext to send troops to Tehran, and the Persian Government could be sure that unless the disarming operations resulted in such serious and prolonged disorders as to be dangerous to foreigners, not a man would be moved. Hussein Kuli Khan also showed some anxiety to find out whether the Russian Minister anticipated that Colonel Yadbolski would raise any objections in case the Government called on the services of the Cossack brigade under his orders. M. Poklewski naturally pointed out that Prince Vadbolski was in the service of Persia, and would of course place his services and advice, and the force he commanded, at the disposal of the Government. If he was asked to do impossible things, he would, of course, raise objections, but only on military grounds. The same evening Colonel Vadbolski was invited to attend a Council of Ministers, and was requested to effect the disarmament. This he declined to do, as he said that a house to house search for arms, such as was then contemplated, required a larger force than the 420-450 men of the brigade then in Tehran, and he would not accept tlm responsibility of attempting it with the assistance of the half-disciplined forces which were all the support that the Government could offer him. As a matter of fact the idea of immediate coercion was abandoned the same night, and on the next day the Government issued a proclamation announcing that all unauthorised persons were to deliver up their arms against payment within forty-eight hours, after which measures would be taken to seize them. The decision, as I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I saw that afternoon, seemed to me to be unwise, for it would encourage the fedais to think the Government was vacillating, and it would give them time to prepare for resistance, or at least to hide their rifles, and in the meantime another murder might be committed. But if none of these predictions were fulfilled, the proclamation produced no result in the shape of surrendered rifles. The fedais of all kinds were equally unwilling to surrender the weapons which alone gave them their importance, and they did not believe that the Government was prepared to go to extremities with them. In this, however, they were mistaken, for the Ministers had succeeded in securing the invaluable services of 4 prim, and they could count on the support of Sardar Assad and the Bakhtians, who three or four days earlier had declared that they would not assist to disarm the fedais. On the afternoon of the 6th, fedais of ali parties began to collect in the garden close to His Majesty’s Legation, known as the Atabeg’s Park, where Sattar Khan and a lew of his followers were living, and the troops and gendarmerie quickly occupied every coign of vantage m the upper floors, and on the roofs of neighbouring houses and on the city walls. Access to the garden was, however, unimpeded, and Bagher Khan, battar Khan s colleague in the defence of Tabreez, is known to have left the place and returned to it on the following morning, the 7th. I am reporting in other despatches the events which took place on that day, and it is sufficient to sav here that by 9GO p M. the fedais had surrendered, Sattar Khan being wounded.87 To all appearances the victory of the Government was complete ; they had had stolen them ■; and it was certainly rather a significant fact that these auxiliaries had done a little looting in the neighbouring houses, and in the garden itself. It subsequently transpired, however, that the Government’s theory that the rifles had been thrown into a deep tank in the garden was correct, for about 300 were eventually recovered. On the other hand two of the most notorious leaders of fedais, Sardar Mohi and Zerghain-es-Sultaneh Bakhtiari, were still at large, the former having betaken himself to his uncle’s house in Zerguendeh, where he was secure as being under Russian jurisdiction, and the latter being in hiding, and the surrender of rifles from the fedais and mujteheds in the town was pitifully small. Tehran does not quite know what to make of the situation. It is recognised that the Government has shown courage and energy, and has done a public service in breaking the power of the fedais and mujteheds. But on the other hand there is a strong current of sympathy with Sattar Khan, who is believed to have deprecated the resistance in which he was forced by circumstances to take a leading part. There is also a certain discontent among the Moslems that the direction of the affair should have been placed in the hands of Yprim, a Christian, and a perceptible anti-Armenian sentiment is abroad ; and finally, no one has any real confidence in the Government. The bazaars, in spite of the Government’s threats, remain partially closed. _ There has been an attempt by the chief of the clergy to take bast at Shahabdulazim, and Moez-es-Sultan (Sardar Mohi) has left Zerguendeh- to take bast with some twenty-five other mujteheds at the Turkish Embassy. to His Majesty’s Legation reporting on the fighting which took place on the On Sunday morning, when the situation appeared to be growing serious, I directed Major Stokes to proceed to the legation in town, as I considered it desirable to have a member of His Majesty’s Legation present, and he remained there until Monday Memorandum by Major Stokes respecting the fighting at Tehran on August 7, 1910. captured about 300 fedais, but when on Monday morning it was known that only some fifty or sixty rifles were forthcoming instead of the 300 which the fedais had taken into the garden, people began to say that the Bakhtiaris who had made the final assault I have, &amp;c. ’ CHARLES M.

Enclosure in No. 161. been secured, aijd some troops^ had &lt; they could fire on the park. Yprim, was in command of the forces, was at the central police station, while two of his [716-J88 orderlies awaited instructions at the palace, where the Cabinet was assembled. At 2 p.m. an enquirer at the palace was officially informed that, failing the laying down of arms, offensive measures would be taken within an hour. This was the situation when, at 2'30 p.m., one of the fedais attempted to leave the park by the main gate. A gendarme told him he must lay down his arms if he wished to go. The man immediately fired at the gendarme with a Mauser pistol, but missed him. A Bakhtiari shot the fedai, who, badly wounded, attempted to regain the park. Two or three of his friends came out to pull him in, whereupon firing became general. The Government troops now began to occupy positions for a regular attack on the park, and while they were doing this those already in position maintained a desultory fire on the defenders. The park is a rectangle, 500 to 600 yards long and 130 yards wide, its north wall lying within 100 yards of the northern ramparts of the town, which command it. It is surrounded by a mud wall 15 feet high and about 2 feet thick, and has three gates, at the south-east and south-west corners, and in the centre of the south face. Along each face runs a street, the opposite side of which is formed by houses or garden walls which are high enough to command the interior of the park. The park, which is fairly thickly wooded, contains two houses, one of them having two storeys. At 4'45 p.m. the attack was begun in earnest, two Creusot quick-firing guns and two Maxims being brought up. One Maxim, posted at the north-east corner of the British Legation, fired at intervals along the south face of the park, but was never directed at the park itself. One quick-firing gun put several shells into the park, but the held guns for the most part endeavoured to make breaches in the park wall. The defenders fired in most cases from loopholes made in the wall. At 7 p.m. a held gun was brought up to the north-east corner of the British Legation, whence it opened hre on the south-east corner of the park. A breach was effected near the south-west corner of the park at about 8 p.m., and the door at that corner was set on hre. The attackers entered at this point about an hour later, and by 10 p.m. Sattar and Bagher Khans and 270 men were prisoners, besides some thirty or forty bazaar people who had come to the park to join in what they thought was a demonstration and had been unable to get away when the fighting began. Though over 2,000 troops were held in readiness by the Government, less than 1,000 actually took part in the hght. The Government losses were hve killed and about a dozen wounded. The fedais lost fifteen killed and twenty-seven wounded, among the latter being Sattar Khan. Of ten corpses of fedais I saw in the park, eight had been shot through the head, presumably at loop-holes. The troops under arms were :— Regular infantry Regular cavalry Gendarmes Police..

(Translation.) THE Imperial Ministry has carefully considered the proposals contained in the aide-memoire of the British Embassy of the 30th July (12th August) of this year, and agrees with the proposal that the Russian Minister at Tehran should join his British colleague in drawing the serious attention of the Persian Government to the insecurity that exists on certain trade routes in Persia. The Imperial Ministry sees no objection to the proposed formation of a force of 1,000 or 1,200 men, analogous to the Persian Cossack brigade, to be under the com mand of eight or ten officers of the Indian army in order to protect the above-mentioned roads. From information just received, the Imperial Government is of opinion that the period of two months which the British Government propose to allow to the Persian Government to restore order on the roads is not sufficient, and that it would be better to extend it to three months, especially as the appointment of a new Governor-General of Fars—probably that of Prince Ain-ed-Dowleh—is shortly to be made.

SINCE my return from leave on the 18th ultimo there has been nothing calling for special record in the political situation at Tehran, where the new Cabinet appears for the moment to be working harmoniously. The Medjliss is busy discussing the engagement of foreign assistants. In the provinces interest has centred in the movements of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, chief of the Kashgai, who has for several weeks been in negotiations with certain of the Bakhtiari Khans and the local assembly at Ispahan with the object apparently of making sure of the retention of the Ilkhaniship. His attitude towards the central Government has recently given cause for anxiety. As reported in my telegram of the 31st August, he sent some days ago a threatening message to the Persian Government, in which he announced that he was about to march on Tehran, having received orders from the Ulema of Nejef to avenge the death of Seyyid Abdullah.^ the threat was thought sufficiently serious to warrant Sardar Assad’s ordering 2,000 Bakhtiaris up from Chaharmahal to Ispahan. The situation was complicated by dissensions amongst the Bakhtiaris. F ais there is no improvement to record. The Firuzabad route is open between ushire and Shiraz, but the postal road between these two places and between Shiraz and Ispahan is closed. Ain-ed-Dowleh has been appointed Governor-General, but has not yet started from Tehran. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 172. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 26.)

AT the sitting of the Medjliss on the 11th August, the Cabinet’s proposal to engage foreign officials for the different Ministries was read. The proposal was as follows :— Ministry of Finance (7 Frenchmen)— Treasury Direct raxes .. Control Ministry of Interior (6 officials)— Central Ministry and Provinces . Gendarmerie .. Police Ministry of Justice (2 officials)— Conseiller legiste Director of Administration 3 2 2 1 Italian. 3 Italians. 2 Swedes. 1 Frenchman. 1 Egyptian It was proposed that these fifteen officials should be engaged for a period of three years. After a short discussion the matter was referred to Committee. On the 16th August the Committee elected to investigate Vekil-ul-Roaya’s accounts submitted a report on the result of the enquiries made. It was to the effect that the accounts showed a considerable deficit regarding which Vekil-ul-Roaya was to give further explanations. The matter has not since been raised. On the 18th ultimo a letter from the Ministry of Finance was read proposing to make a monthly allowance of 400 and 300 tomans respectively to Sattar and Bagher Khans, as v r ell as a further grant of 2,000 and 1,500 tomans respectively. Another letter from the same Ministry w T as read proposing to allow a pension of 500 tomans a-month to the heirs of the later Mujtehed Seyyid Abdullah. Both proposals were referred to Committee. At the sittings of the 20th and 23rd August the Ministerial programme was discussed, and eventually agreed upon by a large majority. On the 25th August a Committee was elected to draw up a programme for the House. The President stated that this programme 1 will include a list of the most important matters which will be put before the House for its decision. This step was taken on account of the excessive waste of time over unimportant matters. A telegram was then read from Sardar Zafar, Bakhtiari, who said that in accordance with the orders of the Medjliss he had dispersed the Bakhtiari force he had collected for the purpose of attacking Soulet-ed-Dowleh. On the 3rd September one of the deputies interpellated the Minister of the Interior regarding current reports as to the action taken by Amir Mufakham, Bakhtiari, and the intention of Soulet-ed-Dowleh to march on Tehran. Farman Farma in reply denied the truth of the reports. On the 6th September the Committee entrusted with the examination of the Ministerial programme respecting the engagement of foreign officials, submitted their report. It recommended that instead of employing Frenchmen for the Ministry of Finance, Swiss should be engaged. During the course of the debate, the clerical Prince Hajji Sheikh-ul-Reis^ moved that the financial assistants should be citizens of the United States of America. I he spokesman on behalf of the Government, Prince Assadullah Mirza, strongly urged the employment of Frenchmen, which he declared to be desirable for reasons _which the Cabinet could not publicly state. It was clear, however, that a great majority was in favour of employing Americans, and the question95 was again referred to Committee. Explaining the nse of the word “employ^ instead of “adviser/’ Assadullah Mirza stated that it might he necessary to endow the officials engaged from abroad with execntive functions, and not to limit their powers to the mere giving of advice. The Shah’s Birthday. On the 2nd September the Shah’s birthday was celebrated in the nsnal manner. The corps diplomatique was received in audience by the Regent and the Shah, and His Majesty’s Minister took the opportunity of presenting to His Majesty the King s letter announcing the sad news of the demise of His late Maj esty, as well as of presenting his new credentials. Tabreez. Taki Zade arrived at Tabreez, from Tehran, on the 9th August. The situation has continued normal. Meshed. Though no one had arrived to replace him, Rukn-ed-Dowleh left Meshed on the 23rd July. The province, though without a Governor-General, has remained quiet. The roads/except on the Afghan frontier and near Turbat, where several robberies are reported, have been safe. The administration shows no signs of improvement, there bemg much friction between subordinate departments. The news of the murder of Seyyid Abdullah caused some uneasiness, but nothing untoward occurrec. Ispahan. 1. On the 9th August, 300 to 400 Bakhtiari horsemen left for Kirman, via Yezd, under command of Iskander Khan, son of Sardai-i-Zafar. % , i 2. The Governor-General continues a policy of subserviency to the clergy, and the local administration shows no improvement. The state of the roads seems to vary a good deal; at times caravans pass unmolested, at others numerous robbenes a e reported These are all attributed to parties of Kashgai tribesmen, the victims m some cases being Bakhtiaris. Throughout August negotiations continued between the various Bakhtiari chiefs, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and the Ispahan clergy. The question at issue appears to be the ilkhaniship of the Kashgais. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, the present ilkhani P has obtained the support of Amir-i-Mufakham and Sardar-i-Asjaa, as well as of the clergy who, with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, are said to be acting on msti notions received from Tehran from Sipahdar. Zaygham-ed-Dowleh, the other candidate for the ilkhaniship, has the support of Sardar-i-Zafar and the other Bakhtiari chiels who t&lt; their orders from Sardar Assad. There have been frequent rumours of fighting, but these are not confirmed. The Government and the Bakhtiari chiefs at Tehian have striven to avert a conflict. Soulet-ed-Dowleh has retired from near Bumisheh to Abadeh and it is understood that Amir-i-Mufakham and the other chiefs who support Soulet-ed-Dowleh will be brought to Tehran, and that Sardar-i-Muhtesham will proceed to Ispahan to maintain order among the Bakhtiaris. . It was reported that a reconciliation had been effected, but this has proved to be incorrect. Sultanabad. On the 27th August severe fighting was i eported between the Governor-General and the Lurs; the situation of the former was said to be precarious. Yezd. Twworrlc' the end of July a rumour was current that the ex-Shah, with Zibes- Sultan and 19 000 men, tad Aded at Resht. Such rumours have a dangerous effect S ' the lawless horded villagers. Sardar-i-Jang, despite the issue by him of a on the lawless uo _ , j p an( i ec l 0 ver the governorship to his nephew, is proclamation announcing that he had handed J Mudabber-ed-Dowleh, who stillg oYJnA' r A 26th J\G 1S proceeding to Jv Nain are reported to be unsafe but Jwf of ^ a PP eara t0 f* 6 normal. Naib Hussein who has been iohe^Wlntizam-ul-MuIk, was at the end of August still near Anarek, whilst the force supposed to be pursuing him remained at Naim.96 Kermanshah. The town and district have continued quiet. The local police are reported to be very unpopular, and towards the end of July there was a disorderly demonstration against them. The governor, on hearing of the disorder, came to town and publicly abused the chief of police. The latter resigned, but was subsequently reinstated under orders from Tehran, and received an apology from the governor. Daoud Khan is reported to be making difficulties about paying taxes ; the state of the roads is normal. Hamadan. 1. On the 26th July an Afghan subject was killed. Representations were made by His Majesty’s acting consul at Kermanshah to the Governor of Hamadan. The murderer has been arrested, but has not yet been tried. 2. After the formation of the new Cabinet, the governor received a telegram from Tehran ordering him to arrest, punish, and expel the disturbers of the peace. The telegram was pu blished, and somewhat frightened the public. The following disturbing rumours were current :— Nazar, the Lur chief, who assisted Sardar-ed-Dowleh in his rebellion, was approaching Burujird. The ex-Shah was about to arrive. Amir-i-Afkham has levied 10,000 lb. of flour from each of his forty-six villages between Hamadan and Kazvin, to be collected at a large village in Sardarud. This is presumed to be intended for some force or expedition. Kerman. The local assembly resumed its sittings towards the end of July, under instructions, it was said, from Tehran. An attempt was made by the priests to prevent the collection of certain fresh taxes authorised by the local assembly, and the octroi collectors were attacked and driven from their posts. The police, however, quelled the disturbance, and reinstated them. The deputy governor is very unpopular, but lately he has been very polite to His Majesty’s consul, and has expressed a desire to settle all British claims. The province has remained quiet with the exception of Baluchistan, where disorder prevails. On the 30th August a large force of Baluchis from Sarhad and Rigan, under Jihand, visited Fahraj and other villages, and besieged the Governor of Bam at Karimabad. The latter’s men are said to have killed fifteen of the raiders, who retired the next day, taking with them a large number of animals and twelve slaves. The Narmashiris lost two men killed. Shiraz. Zaffer-es-Sultaneh, the ex-Governor-General, left for Tehran on the 17th August. Kawam-ul-Mulk has been appointed acting governor. Perfect order is kept in the town. Caravans are using the Firuzabad road to Bushire and the Sarhad road to Ispahan. Both these routes are in the hands of the Kashgais, who blackmail the muleteers. The postal roads north and south are unsafe, being rendered so by the Kashgais who wish their own roads to be used. Ain-ed-Dowleh has been appointed Governor-General, an d_ his _ advent is awaited with interest; he has not yet left Tehran. Public opinion is generally pessimistic owing to the almost complete surrender of the late Governor-General to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. It is to be noted, however, that Sipahdar, at the time Minister of the Interior, was responsible for tins surrender. Soulet-ed-Dowleh is now at Abadeh. It is generally thought at Shiraz that a capable governor, if given full powers, might, with the troops now at Shiraz and the skilful use of Zaygham-ed-Dowleh, be able to restore order. The tribes will shortly be moving from their summer to their winter quarters, and in the absence of a strong governor there is considerable risk of disorder. Persian Gulf. Bushire. At the end of July the Kazerun route to Shiraz was still closed, but the Firuzabad route was safe and in use. Reports from Bunder Abbas and Lingah indicated that the roads from those ports were still unsafe.97 Ahwaz. ri Shuster was in a disturbed state throughout July, and the bazaars were closed. Ihe cause of the trouble is not known. Sheikh Ivhazal summoned the leading men on both sides and announced his intention of putting a stop to these recurrent disturbances even if he had to employ all his forces. Steamers had ceased to run to Shuster, and the Shuster-Dizful road was unsafe. UP till now I have thought it advisable to delay our joint representations with respect to the roads in Southern Persia, partly because it seemed to me that the occasion of the Persian Government obtaining money would be a more opportune moment for making them, and partly because I did not wish to embarrass the Government by whom a strong Governor-General of Pars had been appointed, but as the insecurity of the Ispahan-Shiraz route is worse than ever and the Governor- General-designate has not yet left Tehran, I think we might now make our representations on the lines suggested in your telegram, appointing three months as Sir G.

Barclay to Sir Edicard Grey.—(Received October 24.) Sir, Gulahek, October 6, 1910. THE summary of news for the past month, which I enclose herewith, presents a more than usually disquieting picture of disorder. It is true that the feud, reported in previous despatches, between the two branches of the Bakhtiari khans has been patched up and that Soulet-ed-Dowleh no longer threatens Ispahan, but the retirement of the Kashgais southwards has been marked by widespread devastation and they are reported to be raiding even the outskirts of Shiraz. Meanwhile, the departure of Ain-ed-Dowleh, the Governor-General of Fars, for his post is still delayed, the Government being unable to find funds for equipping a force to accompany him. The post road between Shiraz and Ispahan remains completely blocked for caravans, and several robberies have even occurred on the road north of Ispahan. Luristan has been the scene of more than the usual disorder, and latest reports indicate that the governor is besieged in Burujird. In the north the Shahsevans have again broken into revolt and, after defeating a Government force sent against them from Ardebil, are in complete control of the surrounding districts. The same tribe is also reported to be looting some 20 miles from labreez on the Tabreez—Kazvin road. Even in the neighbourhood of Tehran, in the Demavend district, there is a petty rebellion led by a certain Amir Mukarrem, a large land-owner of Mazanderan, assisted by a certain Rashid-es-Sultan. This move ment is due probably not so much to political motives as to private grievances against the Government, but both men have a considerable following and, though a force sent against them has met with some success, they are in a strong position in the mountains and may still give some trouble to the Government. In Tehran the only events of importance during the month were the resignation of Farman Farma as Minister of Interior and the death of the regent. 1 araian 1 anna s resignation was due to a difference of views with his colleagues on the course to be adopted with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. His Highness favoured the retention of Soulet as chief of the Kashgais at least until the arrival of a Governor-General at Shiraz, while the rest ol the Cabinet were for Soulet’s immediate dismissal, a step which, however, they have not yet taken notwithstanding Farman Farma’s resignation. Vosouk-ed-Dowleh has been strongly pressed to accept the Ministry of the Interior, but has so far persistently refused. As far as I can judge, the Cabinet, though it still retains the valuable support of Sardar Assad and the Bakhtiaris, has declined in popularity since I last wrote. On all sides one hears complaints of its powerlessness to restore order. The best hope seems to lie in the return of Nasr-ul-Mulk. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 181. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for September 1910. Tehran. PRINCE FARMAN FARMA resigned the portfolio of the Interior during the course of the month owing to a difference of opinion with his colleagues respecting the attitude to be adopted by the Government towards Soulet-ed-Dowleh, the Kashgai chief. He maintained that to dismiss Soulet at this juncture would bring about a worse situation in Fars than actually exists, whereas the other members of the Government took a contrary view. So far no one has been chosen to succeed the Prince. Azad-ul-Mulk, the regent, died on the 22nd September, and the following day a special sitting of the Medjliss was held to elect his successor. Nasr-ul-Mulk received over 40 votes, the remainder being given to Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek. The late regent’s funeral was conducted with much ceremony on the 30th September. The diplomatic body attended in uniform. Some anxiety has been caused by the action of Amir Mukarrem and Rashid-es- Sultan north-east of Tehran. The former is hereditary Governor of Larijan, and has his head-quarters at Renneh, on the eastern slopes of Demavend. ^ Both he and Rashid-es-Sultan were prosecuted by the Government, in connection with some dispute over land occupied by them, and the courts having given judgment against them, they retired to the mountains and defied the Government. Expeditions have been sent against them and skirmishes have taken place, but so far both rebels are still at large. At the sitting of the Medjliss on the L8th September, a Shiraz deputy named Hajji Agha severely attacked Sardar Assad, who was sitting in his place as deputy for Tehran, respecting his attitude towards Soulet-ed-Dowleh. The Shiraz deputy strongly urged Sardar Assad not to interfere in matters which did not concern him, and remarked that if he did not cease his unauthorised campaign against the unoffending Kashgai chief he would be no less a rebel that Rashid-es-Sultan. Sardai Assad did not show any feelings of annoyance, but replied quite calmly to the attack. Tabreez. Towards the end of September serious disturbances were reported from Ardebil, where the Shahsevans had risen, defeated the Governor s troops, capturing some guns, and were looting It was rumoured that Rahim Khans son, who had accompanied him into exile, had returned to Karadagh, and was creating disturbances The post to Tehran had been looted near Mianeh. On the 29th September a stiong body of Shahsevans was reported to be looting at Shibli, 25 miles from Tabieez. Meshed. 1. The condition of the province remains unchanged. Many murders and robberies are reported. In the Tabbas district the governor has been taking active measures to suppress a notorious robber, Mohammed Ali of Nishapur, but without success. Ear y in September a caravan belonging to a British subject was plundeied half-a-mi e i Meshed as it was starting for Afghanistan. The Acting Governor-General is power e s as ^ 1ms practically noUoops^ ^ a prominent , wealthy Russia,&gt; subject, disappeared mysteriously towards the end of August, and has not yet been traced. ^ H 2100 Seistan. On the 21st August a caravan on its way to Seistan from Kuh-i-Malik Siah was attacked by a party of robbers —seven Afghans and three Baluchis—near Girdi Chah. The caravan included four camel-loads for His Majesty’s consulate at Seistan. Four men with the caravan were killed and the goods plundered Parties were sent in pursuit of the robbers, who were traced to Mirabad, but have not .yet been caught. About the same time it was reported that a party of pilgrims on its way to Meshed was attacked at the Anjira defile, sixteen persons being killed. On the 12th September the roads were reported still unsafe. Ispahan. At Ispahan itself the situation is normal, and during September all the roads, except that to Tehran, appear to have been safe and caravans to have come in unmolested. In the latter half of September there were three robberies on the Tehran road, the last being that of the post for Tehran, which was plundered some 30 miles north of Ispahan ; the robbers were said to be Bakhtiaris. The quarrel amongst the Bakhtiari chiefs has, for the time at least, been settled. Sardar Assad has summoned most of the leading chiefs to Tehran to arrange a permanent settlement, but it remains to be seen if they will obey the summons. Yezd. 1. Sardar Jang, the governor, left for Ispahan on the 11th September, leaving Salar-i-Moyaed in charge of Yezd. The latter, a young man of 22, has made himself very unpopular with the people by his inconsiderate and brusque manner. It is said with regard to Sardar Jang s term of office that it was marked by a welcome period of safety on the road and of good order in the town, but, on the other hand, his autocratic government was strongly reactionary; bribery was very rife, and all the so-called constitutional departments which were set up had to be subservient to him. The condition of the roads has been normal, excepting the Nain-Ispahan road, which was reported uncertain, and the Yezd-Anar road, which was closed by robbers towards the end of September. 2. Naib Hussein, Kashani, and Intizam-ul-Mulk moved from Anarek to Ardistan towards the end of September and put that place and Zuwareh under contribution. Several of the leading inhabitants of Ardistan, the chief justice included, were seized and maltreated by their followers, but Intizam-ul-Mulk, on his arrival, not only released the chief justice and restored his property to him, but had one of his assailants severely beaten and an ear of another cut off. It appears that Naib Hussein is willing to surrender if the Government will amnesty him and release his son, now a prisoner at Tehran. He has telegraphed in this sense to the National Assembly begging forgiveness. His party is said to number 500 horse and foot. Burujird. The governor is reported to have repulsed an attack made on the town by Silakhoris. There has also been fighting against the Sabz Ali tribe, and the town appears to be blockaded by tribesmen. Kermanshah. 1. The governor’s former authority appears now almost completely sapped. The unusual vigour he displayed in the early months of his governorship won for him many enemies, and these, headed by the leading priest in Kermanshah, the chiefs of the unpopular local Government officials whom he tried to keep under control, and the chief tax collector, whose usual perquisites were interfered with, have made complaints to Tehran against the governor. These complaints, mostly quite unjustifiable, have so weakened his position that his firm attitude has been gradually relaxed, and he has offered his resignation. This has not, however, been accepted by the Government. 2. Early in September four large caravans, principally of opium and valued at 100,000/., ^ were completely plundered near Kangovar, as also a large number of. pilgrims, including some ten families of British Indians, who subsequently reached Kermanshah destitute. Though most of the robberies took place outside his province, Nizam-es-Sultaneh dispatched a force to the scene. It is reported that most of the101 robberies were the work of the Khazzal tribe, the rest that of the Kakawends. The general opinion was that they were instigated by Sardar Akram, who was near Harsin. Ramadan. Fighting took place early in September between Abbas Khan, Chenari, and the Governor of Hamadan, supported by troops from Kurdistan, Abbas Khan was defeated, and took refuge with the Khazzal tribe near Kangovar. said l of atic lied ^ The hief 3 to Kerman. Sarim-ul-Mulk, elder son of Sardar Zafar, and Mudabbir-ed-Dowleh, lately Deputy Governor of Yezd, arrived at Kerman on the 5th September. His Majesty s consul was officially informed that Sarim-ul-Mulk was temporarily Governor-General until the arrival of his father. It was not clear what Mudabbir-ed-Dowleh s position was meant to be. While the roads in Kerman province appear to be safe, those m Baluchistan are all unsafe. On the 18th September the former deputy governor and the chief of police took refuge in His Majesty’s consulate, fearing punishment at the hands of Sarim-ul-Mulk. Shiraz. Kawam-ul-Mulk, the Acting Governor-General, is maintaining good order in the town, but is powerless in the province. The Kazerun road to Bushire remains closed, but caravans are using the Firuzabad road. The mam road to Ispahan is at t le mercy of Kashgai and Arab tribesmen, who spare nothing and rob the posts regularly. The telegraph lines are being continually interrupted, and men sent out to repan them are robbed and beaten. One caravan recently came through from Ispahan by Sarhad route. The Governor of Darab and all the officials have abandoned their posts, and the district is at the mercy of the Baharlus, with whom Sheikh Zakaryieh is said to be on the war-path. The Kashgais under Soulet-ed-Dowleh are migrating southwards and have pillaged the country-side south of Abadeh and have raided even mitskmts of Shiraz. 1 The Acting Governor-General has brought Arab horsemen into the to , as it is not clear what are the intentions of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who ' s ^ thm f of Shiraz.

I have received Persian Government’s note. 22nd October, which please see, is a good summary. After consultation with the Russian Minister I would propose, subject to your approval, to reply pointing out that what is said about the piesence of foreign troops and the abuse of bast at the foreign legations (Russian and Turkish) is irrelevant to the matter in hand, viz., depredations by tribesmen on southern roads ; that statistics showing increased customs receipts apply to the north rather than to the south, and that though it is true that for the last live months the southern customs show a considerable revival (Mohammerah customs, indeed, show a big increase) as compared with the same period last year, it must be remembered that the first months of last year were marked by the Tangistam troubles in Pushire, and in any case it cannot be denied that main southern road is practically impassable owing to disorders, and g 0 long as these continue there can be no lasting revival. I would make it clear that we could not allow surcharge on southern import duties unless the proceeds be spent in opening southern roads, as we could have no confidence that the proceeds would be properly used, and that however reluctant we may be to find ourselves compelled to take measures contemplated, which involve a^ minimum of interference in Persian internal affairs, we intend to see them through if order is not restored in time allowed. I would also state in my reply that His Majesty’s Government will not view unfavourably any loan contracted with a good British house so long as it does not violate conditions laid down in joint note of the 7th April.

HIS Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire telegraphs as follows “ I venture to urge the extreme gravity of actual situation in Southern Persia, of which I beg to submit a summary. . “ Central Government has ceased altogether to control Persian Baluchistan generally. In the last week a raid of Dashtiari tribesmen was expected at Charbar. Presence of one detachment alone deterred the raiders. It is reported that a descent was made last week on the village of one Mir of Biaban, who has been co-opeiating with us, and the Mir himself assassinated. I have dispatched a special messenger to learn the truth of this rumour. Persian authorities have made no attempt to rearrest Mir Barkat, who escaped in August last. , , ^ 4 “I have the honour to refer you to my telegram of the 11th October, with regard to the situation at Bunder Abbas. Early in the month a band of robbers, some 500 strong, from the direction of Lar, descended on the^ district and terrorised several caravans and villages, approaching to within a short distance of our old consulate and quarantine station. No opposition was offered to them by local authorities. Ihey were not followed, and none of the loot has been recovered. British goods to the value oi half a lak of rupees are among the stolen property. . . . • “ I have not telegraphed with regard to Bushire and neighbourhood,^ as the situation has not been sufficiently anxious to warrant my troubling you, but the Tangistams are restless and indisputable proof has reached me in the last few days _ that boulet-ed- Dowleh is trying to persuade certain of their leaders to interfere on his behalf m the Bushire Government. _ . i.p. » “ Plis Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz reports that the Kashgai chief is fomenting disorders in the province and in the town. _ .. . “ Baluchis are expected to attack Narmashir m the Kerman district. “ I have already reported that Bushire-Tehran mails have been diverted by Persian postal authorities to Bagdad and Ahwaz routes. “ You are aware that the line staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department m the south if they can go out at all to repair faults, can do so only at great risk. “ It is impossible to contemplate with equanimity three months more of such lively anarchy and I believe in any case that the force suggested for the patrolling of [716J- ' 'the Bushire-Ispahan route, viz., 1,000 to 1,200 men will no longer be sufficient. It is certain, however, that the difficulty and expense of any measures we may undertake will increase in ratio to the delay that elapses.” I postpone till to-morrow comments on above. No. 190. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 30.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 30, 1910. I HAVE received information from His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz to the effect that a serious riot, in which Government troops as well as Kashgais joined, took place in that town to-day. Mr. Smart reports that the disturbance was instigated by Soulet-ed-Dowleh, whose tribesmen surround Shiraz, and are entering the town. Government house was invaded by rioters, who also sacked the Jewish quarter of the city.

(Telegraphic. 1 Tehran, October 31, 1910. I VENTURE to point out, with reference to my telegram dated the 30th October, that the disorders reported by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, taken generally, testify indeed to a very grave situation in the south of Persia, but, considered separately, they do not differ except in degree from the disturbances which for many months past have prevailed in the south. Except in so far as they react on the condition of the trade routes and expose British subjects to the chance of danger, I am of opinion that these disorders do not directly affect British interests. Hitherto experience has shown that British subjects run little risk from robber raids. His Majesty’s ships are at hand to protect many of them. Furthermore, it is no new thing for the trade routes to be impassable, and though the future may show that our scheme of road-guards is insufficient, I submit that it is at all events worth a trial on the Bushire-Ispahan road before recourse is had to intervention for the general re-establishment of order in the south of Persia, which would necessitate the dispatch of a large expedition, involving great expense, and must have the most far reaching consequences besides. The Government’s weakness proceeds from lack of money. For weeks there has been no Governor-General of Ears because the Government are without the funds to equip properly and dispatch the Governor-General designate to Shiraz. I submit that we ought at least to see what the Government can do with money before having recourse to the perilous experiment of intervention on a large scale. It is to be hoped that financial aid will soon be extended to the Persian Government.SirG. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 1.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 1, 1910.

WITH reference to my telegram of the 25th instant and my despatch of the 15th October, I have the honour to transmit herewith an English translation of the note which 1 have received in reply to my note of the 14th October respecting the re-establishment of order on the southern roads. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 199. Hussein Kuli Khan to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency. Tehran, October 21, 1910. NOTE has been taken of the purport of your Excellency’s communication of the 10th Shavval, 1328 (a.h.) (14th October, 1910), respecting the southern roads, and 1 now have the honour to sa}^ that His Majesty’s Government, being well aware (of the fact), should therefore admit in what (a deplorable) condition the country was in when, after the decline of the former disturbances, the Persian Government last year took up the reins of Government, seeing that all the affairs and Government107 ’-£i. administrations—especially tlie finances—were in complete disorder, and that the foundations of security and public contentment were completely disturbed. Though (the Government were) daily confronted with obstacles, such as the stay of bodies of foreign troops in the interior of the country—which causes public uneasiness, and is the pretext for incitement and intrigue on the part of persons who profited by the former disturbances—as well as other incidents, such as those at Karachidagh, Ardebil, Zenjan, Yeramin, &amp;c., which constantly occupied the Government forces at several points ; from that date to this the affairs of the country have, in many instances, improved and are improving. But unfortunately, in certain places, the intrigues of persons who, for their own profit, wish that the country should remain in the state of disturbance of the former regime, are still going on, as explained below, and have not entirely ceased. For instance, certain persons, after being guilty of sedition and intrigue, take refuge in various legations, and, availing themselves of the protection afforded to them, consider themselves exempt from exile, which is customary in. the case of such refugees, and intrigue within and without the precincts of the legation. Others again, by methods the illegality of the majority of which has never been contested, such as proteges, considering themselves immune, do not recoil from any kind of incitement or sedition. In the same way others who pass among the people as Persian subjects, but in reality, reiving on their foreign nationality, commit crimes with audacity and in complete confidence, and afterwards, declaring themselves to be foreign subjects, evade the jurisdiction of the Government. And also persons, undoubted Persian subjects, who by illegal means pretend they are foreign subjects, and then commit various kinds of sedition. These conditions, which cause the utmost trouble to the Government, provoking disturbances in the country, and, furthermore, the continued stay of bodies of foieign troops, have encouraged some persons to treasonable consideration of a letuin of the former regime and give them unfounded hopes. _ . . Apart from the fact that the Government’s attention and time is thereby, to an extraordinary degree, directed to considerations and necessities i elating to home affairs, this matter is naturally a cause of regret and sorrow, as a prolongation of this state of affairs might possibly cause a blow to and injure trade between I ersian and British subjects in the southern provinces. The Persian Government is of opinion that the principal cause ol this unlortunate state of affairs, apart from the reasons above stated, is the unfoitunate impiession caused by the stay of bodies of foreign troops and the financial stiaits and embariass- ment of the Government, which is one of the consequences of the mismanagement and carelessness of the former regime. _ _ # „ If these unfortunate impressions and financial straits did not exist, the forces at present at the Government disposal would be sufficient for the maintenance of order, and the maintenance of order on the southern roads would present no difficulty m But, as mentioned above, it is because of'financial straits and embaiiassments that the Government has not been able to fulfil its principal aim, which is that of incieasing As in the reply of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 26th Rabbi-ul-Avvel (a.h.) (7th April, 1910), it was brought to your Excellency’s notice that the new Government, as soon as formed, had laid it down in the programme which they presented to the Mediliss that a portion of the advance and loan which they had m view should be devoted to the increase of security on the roads. _ Consequently the Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs of that day entered into negotiations with your Excellency regarding an advance and loan. , ^ n imn\ • + +i The note of the 5th Sefer, 1328 (a.h.) (16th February, 1910), m answer to the efforts of the Persian Government, contained conditions laid down by the British Government for that small advance, the acceptance of which would have _ been contrary to the independence of the kingdom, the maintenance of which is the pnmaiy dutv of every Government. In view of these circumstances the Persian Government sou 'lit for other means of procuring funds. In the meantime, your Excellency s note of the 3rd Rabbi-ul-Avvel, 1328 (a.h.) (16th March, 1910), regarding the International Syndicate brought about discussions and exchanges of notes which caused delay m the obtaining of the fund necessary for the purpose of increasing security on the roads. At the same time, besides the fact that the discussions and exchange of notes above mentioned created results which preoccupied the Persian Government, t ey brought about ideas among the public, the result of which in course of time has led to the situation referred to in your Excellency’s recent note.ffiTfimnanm i.»—- 108 Under these circumstances, your Excellency’s sense of justice will cause you to admit that if the new Government had not at the outset heen confionted with these difficulties in obtaining money, the maintenance of complete security would have heen much easier for the Government than it is at present. In spite of this the Persian Government have not for an instant swerved from their purpose, and, with the accomplishment of this object m view, they are considering the followdng means of obtaining funds :— Thev are in process of negotiation with a group regarding their recognised (consolidated) debt to the Imperial Bank with lower interest, and the Persian Government is of opinion that in this manner a sum of money will be available which will enable them quickly to put an entire stop to sedition and incitement. The guarantee which the Persian Government propose to offer for this loan is the same guarantee which was given for their recognised (consolidated) debt to the Imperial Bank, on account of the reveymes of the southern customs. * T or this reason the guarantees of Persia’s other loans will in no way suffer. Iu view of the Persian Government’s anxiety respecting the immediate security of the commercial highways, they consider it very appropriate that the greater part of the expenditure now necessary for increasing the security of the roads should be met by the funds obtained by this transaction, and they assure His Majesty’s Government that the Indian loan of 1904 udll in no way be adversely affected by this financial measure. In these circumstances, the Persian Government are quite confident that His Majesty’s Government, in view of their anxiety respecting the development of commerce, will look favourably upon this transaction, which the Persian Government have in view chiefly on this account. At the same time, I think it necessary to draw your Excellency’s attention to the fact that as the Persian Government cannot every year, by successive loans, meet its requirements, they must find a source of revenue to meet each requirement; and the best source of revenue obtainable at the present time, under the present conditions of Persia, which could furnish a portion of the sum required for the gendarmerie, is that very suggestion contained in your Excellency’s last note regarding an increase of 10 per cent, on the customs revenues. But as the proposal contained in the above-mentioned note is contrary to the undoubted independence of the Persian Government, the friendly relations and the amity which up till now have existed between the two Governments, the Persian Government can never under any circumstances consent to it. But as, on the other hand, the Persian Government take particular note of the anxiety of His Majesty’s Government respecting the commercial highways, and as the Persian Government consequently regard the maintenance of their own independence and the removal of His Majesty’s Government’s anxieties on this score as identical, they consider it desirable that this 10 per cent, tax should be levied on the customs by the Persian Government themselves and be expended on the necessary increase of security. The Persian Government therefore.request His Majesty’s Government, through the medium of your Excellency, that they should give their support to the accomplish ment of this aim ; and as this request of the Persian Government is made with the object of developing commerce, and the Persian Government consider its fulfilment necessary for the maintenance of the very same security which you mentioned, its acceptance should be hastened. Before concluding this note I consider it necessary, in order to prove that commerce has not suffered, to draw the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the extraordinary increase of the customs receipts from the south. Without, however, entirely denying that in recent times there have been any kind of troubles and obstacles in the way of means of commerce between Persia and England, I consider that it is shown by the statistics of customs revenue that no real commercial losses have been sustained by British subjects, while, on the other hand, the increase of 100,000 tomans in the Arabistan customs receipts in the year “ Takagoui-il ” (1909-10), as compared^ to the previous year, and the extraordinary increase during the present year, conclusively proves that southern commerce has only been temporarily diverted from its former channel. furthermore, the whole of Persia’s commercial imports during last vear showed an increase of about 19 per cent, over those of the year “Pichi-il” (1908-9/, and during the five months of the present year an increase of 20 per cent, is shown. Ihe part italicised does not appear in the French translation supplied by the Persian Foreign Office.In view of the facts above stated, the Persian Government are of opinion that foreign subiects have no cause of complaint regarding commerce with Persia.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.-—{Received November 21.) Sir, Tehran, November 2, 1910. I HAVE the honour to transmit the monthly summary, which, I regret to have to point out, presents an even darker picture of chaos than that enclosed m my despatch of the 6th October. . „ . ^ • , i In the south the new developments calling for mention are the riots m binraz, t le threatened attack on Lingah, necessitating the landing of 160 British bluejackets and four guns, the disorders in the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, and the threatened advance of Baluchis on the district of Narmashir. The state of the post road between Bushire and Shiraz is worse than ever, and both this roaxl and that between Shiraz and Ispahan remain impassable for caravans. Even the Bakhtiari road from Ahwazto Ispahan which had hitherto been safe, has been the scene of several robberies, m which Bakhtiaris as well as Kuhgeluis are reported to have been the culprits. In the north the most tangible of the disturbing features has been the fighting at Nash an. This is, however, now happily terminated with the flight of rsaib Hussem. As regards the other seats of disorder, in Karachidagh Rahim Khan s son is said to havebeen defeated, but the Shabsevan district, my Eussian colleague tells me, is beyond the Government’s control, and M. Poklewski informs me that the same may be said of Mazanderan, where Amir Mukarrem with Eashid-es-Sultan is reported to have turned the tables on the Government troops. In Tehran the matters specially calling for mention are the loan negotiations, the presentation of our note on the 14th October regarding the southern trade routes, and the recent changes in the Cabinet. I have, &amp;c. G. BAECLAY. Enclosure in No. 203. Summary of Events in Persia for October 1910. Tehran, A NOTE was addressed on the 14th October to the Persian Government respecting the disorders on the southern roads, and the Persian Government’s reply was received on the 22nd. The Cabinet was reconstructed on follows :— Premier .. Minister of the Interior Minister of War Minister of Finance Minister of Justice .. Minister of Foreign Affairs .. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Minister of Education the 30th October, and is now composed as .. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek (unchanged). .. Prince Ain-ed-Dowleh. .. Prince Farman Farma. .. Sani-ed-Dowleh. .. Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh. .. Hussein Kuli Khan (unchanged). .. Assadullah Mirza (unchanged). .. Vacant. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Medjliss was re-elected the 13th October as follows :— Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Motamin-ul-Mulk, Sani-ed-Dowleh, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, Mamtaz-ed-Dowleh, Moaziz-ul-Mulk. Tabreez. On the 24th October His Majesty’s vice-consul reported that Eahim Khan’s son, with 1,500 men, was creating serious disturbances in Karajadagh, and had attacked'the Government forces near Ahar. A later report stated that he had been defeated. Meshed. The situation remains unchanged. The chief of police was dismissed on the 1st October, and left on the 3rd for Tehran. The Tabbas and Turbat districts are reported to be in a disturbed condition, owing to bands of robbers. Zahir-es-Sultan is officiating as Governor-General. Seistan. The state of the roads was, in the middle of September, still unsatisfactory. Ispahan. Sardar-i-Ashjaa, Bakhtiari, was on the 10th October succeeded in the post of Governor-General by Motamid-i-Khakan. The new Governor-General appears anxious to cultivate friendly relations with His Majesty’s consul-general. Agha Norulla has left Ispahan for Kerbela. Some show was made of a desire to persuade him to return, several leading men going out to bring him back, but in general his departure seems tc have given satisfaction. Ihe Kermanshah and Yezd roads have remained safe. The Shiraz road to Abadeh has been practically closing owing to bands of marauders, who are said to be waiting for a European to exact vengeance for the men killed by Mr. Bill’s escort. Ihe Tehran road has been considerably disturbed, posts being robbed and delayed. ^ The robberies are variously attributed to Naib Hussein’s followers and to Bakhtiaris. Several Europeans have been detained at Ispahan owing to the state ofIll this road, but two English travellers from Tehran have reached Ispahan safely. The Ahwaz road was until the 26th October quite safe, but since that date two large robberies have been reported. The Ispahan postal authorities have, owing to the Shiraz road remaining closed, arranged for mails to be carried by the Ahwaz road to Nasiri. The service is to be weekly, and mails are to reach Nasiri from Ispahan^ in twelve to fourteen davs. Early in October most of the leading Bakhtiari chiefs assembled at Ispahan, bringing with them in all some 1,000 horsemen. A general reconciliation was arranged, and it was decided that they should all go to lehran. This they now intend to do when they have dealt with Naib Hussein at Kashan. Kashan. Early in October Naib Hussein and Intizam-ul-Mulk were at Ardistan with their followers. They made several offers of surrender to the central Government on certain conditions, but the Government demanded their unconditional surrender. I hey then marched on Kashan, where they arrived on the 7th October, and _ were welcomed by the townspeople, though numbers of the latter fled to Kum on hearing o Naib Hussein’s return. Naib Hussein posted up notices in Kashan that he would hurt no one, and no one need be afraid of him. On the 9th a force of Bakhtians unc er Amir-i-Mufakham and Sardar-i-Zafar left Ispahan for Kashan, and was followed next day by other chiefs and their followers. On the 11th the people of Kashan telegraphed to Tehran asking for the release of Naib Hussein’s son, and Naib Hussein announced that, failing a satisfactory reply to this request, he would be compelled to take drastic measures. He fortified several buildings and the town gates, and was reported to have with him 1,200 well-armed men, mostly horsemen. The buildings fortified included the building used jointly by the Indo-European Telegraph Department and the 1 ersian Telegraph Administration as their office. On the 12th 180 loads pf goods for European firms at Tehran reached Kashan, and were looted by Naib Hussein s men as soon as it was known that they were intended for Europeans. Some Bakhtiaris arrived on the ] 3th, and fighting began the same day. Firing continued during the night, and the Bakhtiaris made two attempts to rush the position, but were repulsed, four benig killed. On the 14th Amir-i-Mufakham and 500 Bakhtiaris arrived, and during the night the Pusht-i-Meshed quarter of the town was captured from Naib Hussein s men. Ihe la ter attempted to recapture it, but were defeated. The Bakhtians were said to have had from ten to twenty men killed, including several of the younger chiefs, and an urgent message for medical assistance was sent to Tehran via Kum. Amir-i-Mufakham was reported to be unwilling to bombard the town and cause loss of life to women and children. He was in favour of pardoning Naib Hussein and giving him a public post in Kashan. He was directed by the central Government to inflict the least possible punishment on the Kashams, and to direct all fire on Naib H' 88 ®' and his men. Some Bakhtiaris stole the post horses from some stages on the Ispahan road, but these were subsequently returned. On the 23rd Naib Husseins son sent the telegraph signaller a message at Kashan to the effect that before escaping ^om Kashan he would destroy the telegraph office and as much of the line as he cou order to attract the attention of His Majesty’s^ Legation. _ A strong message was seid to him from His Majesty's Minister advising him to refrain from any ™ch ytiom the 26th the Bakhtiaris made two attempts to rush the enemy s position, hut were repulsed. The Bakhtiari chiefs at Kashan once more requested permission from i ehra to bombard the town. The number of Naib Hussein’s men was ^w said to be 2,o00. Reinforcements with artillery were sent to the Bakhtians from Ispahan and lehran and on the 30th October the bombardment of the town was begun. At o A^. on the 31st Naib Hussein, with a force of, it is stated, 300 men made his ^P e A force of Bakhtiaris is said to have gone in pursuit of him. The town occupied by Bakhtiaris. Sultanabad. Muntassir-ed-Dowleh, lately Governor of Burujird, wl m a PP^ his cost arrived at Sultanabad on the 9th, and left again on the L4th for Kum, tiaye as secretly as possible. The Lurs were once more engaged in plundering villages in the Saraband district, and the roads were unsafe. The post from Kermanshah was plundered by Lurs near Kum on the 15th October. Yezd. The governor continues a campaign of extortion, and has put a stop to the work of the administration by his treatment of the heads of the various department .The Chief Justice closed his court, and took refuge in the_ British telegraph office, but was persuaded to leave it. The chief of police was publicly abused by the governor. The people telegraphed twice to Tehran complaining of the governor, but as they got no satisfaction, on the 13th and 14th October demonstrations were made protesting against local taxation. The doors of the local assembly were burnt down, the chief of police was fired at and fled, and the bazaars were closed. While Yedz-Nain and Yezd—Meshed roads are reported safe, the fehiraz and Kerman roads are closed. On the Kerman road several small parties of robbers render the road unsafe, while the postal service to Kerman is entirely disorganised owing to the disappearance of post horses from several stations. The post is conveyed on donkeys. The Bakhtiari horsemen returning from Kerman are reported to have done a great deal of plundering on the way. Trade is practically at a standstill, and prices have risen considerably at Yezd. There have been several instances of individuals seeking refuge from the tyranny of local officials in the British telegraph offices at and near Yezd. The refugees were informed that His Majesty’s Government could not interfere in the internal affairs of Persia. Kermanshah. Cholera broke out in the town early in October and has continued to spread both in the town and in the district. The governor and other leading officials, the troops, and about four-fifths of the inhabitants have deserted the town. Business was on the I 6th October at a standstill and a state of panic prevailed. The only troops left in the town were thirty Persian Cossacks, forming the governor’s escort. On the 20th October fighting was reported to have occurred between Sinjabi and Kalhur tribesmen near Kasr-i-!Shirm. Habibullah Khan, son of a former Sinjabi chief, having obtained troops from Daoud Khan, attacked Samsam-ul-Mamalek, but was repulsed with considerable loss. He then retired to obtain more troops. Mean while the Governor of Karend has been instructed by the Governor of Kermanshah to support Samsam-ul-Mamalek. Kerman. The local situation has remained unchanged. On the 21st October a force of Baluchis under Jehind and Mohammed Keza Khan, was reported to be moving on Fahreh with the intention of raiding Narmashir. On the 26th this force, which was said to number 1,500 men, was reported to b© within 20 miles of Fahreh, at which place 600 Government troops had been collected to oppose it. The Baluchis came to within 8 miles of Fahreh, but then turned off towards Bam, apparently being afraid to attack Narmashir. Shiraz. Fars is still without a Governor-General, but the deputy governor, Kawami-ul- Mulk, appears to have maintained order in Shiraz itself until the 30th October. On the 29th Soulet-ed-Howleh arrived in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, and early on the 30th his two partisans, Nasir-ul-Mulk and Baha-es-Sultaneh, went out to see him. Immediately after their departure, a mob broke into the Government-house with the corpse of a Mohammedan girl whom they pretended Jews had murdered. The rioters completely sacked the courts of justice, destroying or carrying off everything, the archives included. They even threatened Kawami-ul-Mulk, who,' however, drove them out. xhe rioters then attacked the Jewish quarters. Soldiers sent to defend the quarter joined the rioters in pillaging. Numbers of Kashgais then joined in and did more damage than all the others. The quarter was completely sacked; eleven Jews weie killed and fifteen wounded, and every house was entirely stripped. The whole population of 5,000 Jews, rich and poor, are now absolutely destitute. Mr. Smart, who repoited^ these facts, after a personal inspection of the Jewish quarters, has ananged a lehef subscnption with the local authorities. It is reported that Soulet-ed- Dowleh undoubtedly instigated the riot, through Nasir-ul-Mulk and Baha -es-Sultaneh, m ordei^ to compel the central Government to give him full powers and turn out the Kawarms. the troops at Shiraz are unpaid and disaffected. Including Persian Cossacks and Aiabs, the Kawami has only 400 loyal troops. The opinion is held t rat the situation would be improved if Soulet-ed-Dowleh were sternly admonished, Nasir-ul-Mulk expelled from Shiraz, and martial law proclaimed. Failing this, further disorders may be expected. I he roads in Fars are all very unsafe, and traffic is a most entnely suspended. Much damage has been done to tbe telegraph line,especially in the neighbourhood of Dasht-i-Arjin and Kazerun. Men sent out to repair the line have been robbed and ill-treated. Between Ispahan and Shiraz, the country side is overrun by Boir Ahmedis, Kuhgeluis, and Lashanis, and many villages are reported to have suffered at their hands. Persian Gulf. Bushire. Telegraphing on the 30th October, Colonel Cox reported that the Tangistanis were restless, and that Soulet-ed-Dowleh was endeavouring to induce some of their leaders to interfere on his behalf in the Bushire Government. Owing to the unsafe condition of the roads, the postal authorities were sending the mails for Tehran via Bagdad or Ahwaz. The governor’s attempt to take charge of the Tangistani port of Dilwar has proved abortive : the customs post there has been withdrawn, and imports into and exports from that port have been forbidden. Bunder Abbas. Early in October, some 500 robbers from Lar invaded the Bunder Abbas district and nlundered caravans and villages right up to the town itself. The local authorities were unable to oppose them or to follow them up. The goods plundered included British goods to the value of 3,300/. Lingah. On the 22nd October His Majesty’s vice-consul reported that a well-known marauder named GhoBm Hussein Khan, of M^arawi, near Bastak, was marching on Lingah with a large following, and asked for the presence of a war-ship. His Majesty’s ship “Fox,” with the senior naval officer, arrived off Lingah on the 24th. On the 25th His Majesty’s Minister authorised the landing of sufficient force for the_ protection _ of foreign lives and property if an attack appeared eminent. At the same time the senior naval officer was instructed by Colonel Cox to send Gholam Hussein Khan a message warnino’ him against coming to Lingah. On the 25th the marauders, 3,000 strong, were reported to be two days’ march west of Jebel Turunjah. The force was that of a coalition of three chiefs, those of Galadar, Iskanu, and Warawi. On the 27th a Persian force sent out from Lingah to stop the marauders was reported to have been defeated, and 160 men with four guns were accordingly landed from His Majesty s ship fox. The senior naval officer was authorised to take the necessary measures to prevent the marauders entering the town. News having been received on the 29th October that the Chief of Mazkur had embarked 800 men at Sbivuh to attack Lingah, His Majesty s ship “Odin” was sent to deal with him.

No. 206. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 19.) Sir, Tehran, November 18, 1910. WITH reference to my despatch of the 29th ultimo, enclosing the Persian Government’s reply to my note of the 14th October, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note which I addressed, in accordance with your instructions, to the Persian Government on the 17th instant on the subject of the restoration of order on the Bushire-lspahan road, I have, &amp;c. G, BARCLAY, Enclosure in No. 206, Sir G. Barclay to Persian Government. M. le Ministre, Tehran, November 17, 1910. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge your Excellency’s note of the 21st ultimo. In replying to this communication I do not deal with your Excellency’s references to the presence of foreign troops in Persia, as I consider these references to be irrelevant to the matter with which I am now specially concerned, viz., the outrages and depredations of tribesmen on the southern trade routes. Your Excellency points to the increase in the total volume of Persian trade for 1909-10 (Takhaghouil) as compared with the year 1908—9, and to the further increase which has marked the first five months of the current year, but I must point out that the increase observable in 1909-10 applied, as can be seen from the customs returns, to the north and not to the south. In particular it will be seen that the Bushire customs receipts for last year were much lower than 1908—9, just as in 1908—9 thev were much lower than in the preceding year. As regards the increase during the first five months of the current year it is true that the southern customs share in this increase, but it should be remembered that this yeai s harvest has been exceptionally abundant, and that the first five months of last yeai with which comparison is made included the period during which Bushire was m the power of Seyyid Murteza and his Tangistanis, and I would draw your Excellency s attention to the fact that notwithstanding this the Bushire receipts only show an increase of some 12 per cent. • ^ ) 11 \ whatev 8 r may be the statistics of trade for the past months, it cannot be denied that certain of the southern roads are practically impassable. This especially ic eis to the main southern trade route connecting Bushire with Ispahan, the district on e coniines of the provinces of Ears and Ispahan being in a state of indescribable 1801 though traffic between Bushire and Shiraz has not latterly been entirely stopped, it has only been able to pass by an inconvenient and circuitous route where merchandise is subjected to extortionate and illegal fees, and only bv the sufferance of a tribal chief who is not under full control of the Government. ei e can, indeed, be no hope of any lasting revival of trade so long as the present anarchy continues on these southern roads, and it was with a view to securing for this deplorable state of things a remedy to be applied if possible by the Persian Government,115 but if necessary with the assistance of British officers lent from the Indian army to the Persian Government, that I have addressed your Excellency on the subject. It could not be contended that the above measures would constitute any infringement of the sovereign rights of Persia, as the officers lent from the Indian army would take service under the Persian Government. As regards the 10 per cent, surcharge on the import duties on goods passing through the southern customs, I am to state that His Majesty’s Government can only agree to this charge on condition that the proceeds are spent effectively on securing the safety of the southern trade routes. The scheme foreshadowed in my note of the 14th October for the organisation of a Persian force with British officers would satisfy this condition. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 207. Sir G, Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Beceived December 19.) Sir, Tehran, November 20, 1910. SHORTLY after the news reached Tehran of the meeting held some weeks ago at Constantinople to protest against the action of England and Russia in Persia, an attempt was made to organise a similar demonstration here. An anonymous circular was widely distributed, calling on all true patriots to meet on the 17th November in the Artillery Square to demonstrate against the continued presence of Russian troops, and against the British note respecting the condition of the South. At the appointed time a few hundred persons having assembled, the principal mujtehed declared the proceedings opened, and several speakers proceeded to address the audience on the subject of Persia s alleged wrongs. The action of England and Russia was characterised by the various speakers as directed towards the termination of Persia’s independence, and the convic tion was expressed that the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government towards this country bv no means affected the sympathetic feelings of the British nation towards Persia. The meeting, however, did not evoke much patriotic enthusiasm among the somewhat indifferent gathering, and though the local press has endeavoured to make much of it as a great popular demonstration, it seems to have been a complete failure. There seems little doubt that the whole thing was organised by the local journalistic leaders, perhaps encouraged by the militant Nationalist element in the Assembly, as they have been extremely noisy of late in their attacks on Russia and England, especially since the publication of my note of the 14th October, respecting the southern roads. _ . The suggestions which have been made m a portion of the European press as to the recent note being the forerunner of the partition of Persia by Great Britain and Russia have not fallen unheeded in this country. The articles have been trans lated and published in full, while the comments thereon have, in some cases, been even more exaggerated than those which appeared in the European papers ^ An open letter has also appeared in the local press from the chief priests of JNejet to the foreign representatives at Tehran, m which a fervent appeal is made to justice and honour against the supposed aggressive aims of Great Britain and Russia. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 208. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Beceived December 19.) Tehran, November 30, 1910. SINCE my note of the 14th October regarding the disorders on the southern trade routes was presented there has been every indication that the Persian Govern ment at length realise the necessity of opening the mam southern road. The first essential steps to this end—the appointment of a really competent Governor-General of Ears and of one who can be induced to take up the post has already been taken. At first it was proposed to bring the Zil-es-Sultan back to Persia [716] “ 1116 to fill this post. Indeed, the Cabinet telegraphed on the 3rd instant offering His Imperial Highness the appointment, but Jellal-ed-Dowieh, the Ziffs son, telegraphed to his father advising him not to accept it. They have appointed Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who has recently done good work as Governor of Kermanshah. He has extensive property between Bushire and Shiraz, and some influence in the province of Fars. His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah reports that he is on the point of leaving for his new post, and will travel via Bushire. But without the backing of a strong force there can be little hope that even an efficient governor will be able to deal with the situation. The Minister of War has undertaken to dispatch a force of between 2,000 and 3,000 men to Shiraz, and now that the Persian Government seem about to accept the offer of financial assistance from the Imperial Bank there seems a good prospect of Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s receiving the promised support. Meanwhile, it is announced that Soulet-ed-Dowleh has guaranteed the safety of the main route from Bushire to Shiraz. Unfortunately, the value of this guarantee is largely discounted by the news which reaches me at the moment of writing that the first caravan to abandon the circuitous routes recently followed and to trust to Soulet’s guarantee has been looted between Shiraz and Kazerun.

THE pi incipal Bakhtiari khans are about to assemble at Tehran, and several of them have already arrived. The khans who lately besieged Naib Hussein at Kashan are on their way to lehran with their men. Sardar Assad has summoned them to Tehran in consequence of the recent disagreements which arose between them, and which nearly brought about inter-tribal hostilities. Their misunderstandings have, for the time, been cleared up, and it ^ will now have to be decided which of 'the khans will go to the Bakhtiari country m authority over the tribe.

The Governor of Tabbas fled fromTabbas to Purbat, where he was, towards the end of October, awaiting reinforcements to enable him to return to his post. The roads to Seistan and to the Afghan frontier were reported to be unsafe, and robberies were frequent, especially near Turbat. Seistan. Armed parties of Baluchis are reported to have taken to the road and to have committed numerous robberies. His Majesty’s consul has urged the local authorities and chiefs to restrain their men, but the success of the raids made on Narmashir by the more southern Baluchis has caused the Seistan Baluchis to try their fortune, All the roads are reported to be unsafe, Ispahan. The town has remained quiet, but there is considerable discontent at the scarcity and high price of bread. The authorities are trying to reduce the price of bread, but have to contend with the holders of grain, who are wealthy and influential persons, many of them members of the local clergy. The state of the province, which was unsatisfactory, there being many complaints of the illegal surtaxes exacted by local governors, has improved somewhat. The Governor-General appears to be desirous of cultivating friendly relations with both consulates. There has been a certain amount of intrigue against him, which is attributed to his predecessor, Sardar-i-Asjhaa. All the roads have been disturbed. The posts on the Tehran road were at first delayed owing to the removal of the post horses by Bakhtiaris, but, though the horses have been returned, the posts are still somewhat irregular. The Shiraz road has remained closed, and robbers are reported at Kumisheh, Yezdikhast, and Abadeh. On the Yezd road, 300 robbers were reported at Nain on the 3rd November, and ten camels with their loads were carried off from Nogumbaz. The post was attacked near Ardakan. The governor left for the scene. On the Sultanabad road, on the 14th October, a caravan of pilgrims was attacked, four being killed, and at the same time a caravan of opium was plundered. On the Ahwaz road, between the 17th and 20th October, four robberies occurred at Murwari, Sultani Sari Bak, and Gandum Kar. At the last-named place the mails were robbed. These robberies were erroneously stated in last month’s summary to have occurred after the 26th October. The Bakhtiari chiefs promised to take immediate steps to re-establish security on this road, and no further robberies have been reported, Kashan. On the 31st 250 Bakhtiaris were reported to have left Kashan in pursuit of Naib Hussein, who passed through Khalibad on his way to Ardistan that night. He then moved by Zavareh and Amirabad, and reached Shahrab, 36 miles east of Ardistan, on the 3rd November. His followers were deserting him daily, and only 100 men remained with him. He was making for Anarek, which is described as an oasis in the middle of an absolute desert. Shahab-us-Sultaneh was at Ardistan on the 3rd. He is reported to be in hot pursuit of Naib Hussein, and considerable reinforcements have passed through Ardistan on their way to join him. The Bakhtiaris are said to be keenly mortified at Naib Hussein’s escape from Kashan. On the 1st November it was reported that some Bakhtiaris had looted part of the bazaars at that place. The chiefs promised to' punish the offenders. The town was quiet, and Munazzam-ed-Dowleh had been appointed governor. Yezd. The governor has continued to extort money on all sides. One result of this has been that numbers of respectable people have endeavoured to foice their way into the vice-consulate to take refuge from the governor’s exactions. In spite of all efforts to prevent them, some found their way in and declined to leave, denying that the governor’s assurances were of any value. Trade in Yezd is at a standstill. The Bakhtiaris forming the escort of the ex-Governor of Kerman are reported to have plundered villages and travellers along their loute fiom Yezd to Kashau. On the 9th November near Kabutar Khan, on the Kerman road, the caravan of the Bussian consul from Kerman was robbed, but M. Petroff pursued with his escort and recovered nearly all his property. On the 7th November 800 Baharlus attacked Dehaj and captured 1 000 sheep The Dehajis, however, blocked the passes, drove off and pursued118 the robbers, killing four, wounding several, and capturing one. Their own losses were one killed and four wounded. Zaygham-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, has now been appointed governor, and left Ispahan for Yezd on the 19th November. Kermanshah. 1. The cholera epidemic seems to have ceased by the end of October, only a few cases being reported in November. Many of the fugitives from the town returned to their homes, but the governor still remained outside the town. liobberies in the neighbourhood of the town were of frequent occurrence. Nizam-us-Sultaneh has now been appointed Governor-General of Fars, and it is understood that Rukn-ed-Dowleh will succeed him at Kermanshah. 2. Early in November the Kalhors again attacked Kasri Shirin, the governor of which place fled to Kermanshah, where he arrived on the 6th. The telegraph wire between Serpul and Kasr-FShirin was cut, and many people sought refuge in the custom-house, Kerman. Jelal-ed-Dowleh has been appointed Governor of Kerman; pending his arrival, Sardar-i-Nusrat is officiating, and His Majesty’s consul reports him to be most obliging. Sarim-ul-Mulk, who was officiating for Sardar-i-Jang, is stated to have appropriated a considerable sum of public money while at Kerman. Sardar-i-Nusrat has established quarantine stations against cholera at Anar and Kawar for pilgrims returning from Meshed. The people of Kawar are said to have been seized with panic, and many fled from the town. The Bunder Abbas road was, during October, reported unsafe^ for travellers, as was the road between Kerman and Yezd. On the 4th November it was reported that a force of Baluchis had plundered Kashid, some 30 miles north of Bam, carrying off much booty, and killing thirty-two men. The force then moved towards Khabis. Shiraz. Little or no improvement in the condition of Fars and of the roads to Bushire and Ispahan was recorded during October. In November, however, the state of the Ispahan road improved slightly, owing to the departure southwards of the tribes, but the Boir Ahmadi still remain engaged in plundering on the Aminabad-Abadeh section of the road. The northern post has been reduced to a service of messengers on foot. J his system is safer, but takes twice the time of the waggon post. Nizam-es-Sultaneh has been appointed Governor-General, and is on his way to Shiraz fiom Kermanshah via Bagdad and Bushire. Soulet-ed-Dowleh reached Kazerun on the 10th November, and a few days later was entrusted by the central Government with the task of keeping open the Kazerun road to Bushire. His departure from t e neighbourhood of Shiraz had an excellent effect on the town, which became much quieter. Persian Gulf.

NO robberies on Bushire-Ispahan road have been reported since 5th December, but latest intelligence is that Soulet, owing to disaffection of his tribesmen, has failed to provide adequate guards or to recover plunder, and that cessation of robberies is due solely to wintry weather. Nevertheless, caravans are now passing along main Bushire-Shiraz road, though certain British firms have hesitated to dispatch goods by it unless I assured them that Persian Government would be held liable for losses.Further Correspondence respecting the Affairs of Persia.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100046384822.0x000008_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/261/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100046384822.0x000008</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/261/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Persia.
