H.B.k s Consul at Shiraz informs me that this statement has soon prepared on tne^same lines as the accounts which colonel Gough^ submitted m September 1918, but that whereas S n ?f casi0 1 n Governor General gave signed receipts lor the items shown as recoverable from the Persian Government, on this occasion he has refused to do so* At the time of making application to His Maiesty’s Government for these later advances Sir Percy box was careiul to point out that they would have to be considered tor the most part as a subsidy rather than as recoverable o£? a ^ l ni s •. 1 1 , e statement submitted shows that a sum of Krans 260 ,4 ^0 might now be added to the claim already lodged with the Persian Govenment of Krans 3,930,472,50 but as Farman larma refuses to produce vouchers for these new items, it is probable that the Persian Government will refuse to acknow ledge liability for them. Moreover it is to be noted that the claim lodged with the Persian Government for Krans 3 930 472,50 included an luem of Krans 1,500,000, advances for Gendarmerie purposes for which Colonel Gough had not been able to obtain accounts from tne Couth Persia Rifles* These accounts have not yet been made out by the South Persia Rif ikes, but it appears that there is an unexpended balance of Krans 200 604.25 in the hands of H.B.M’s Consul at Shiraz, which will have to be deducted from the claim. As the details of this claim of Krans 3,930,472, 50 have not yet been called for by the Persian Government, I do not propose at present either to intimate to them the additional claim for Krans 263,425. nor the reduction due to them of Krans 200,604, 25, but to leave these points in abeyance for consideration 7/hen the whole question comes up for settlement.

By a decision taken by the Eastern Committee on June 21st, His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz was authorised to inform him, in reply, that His Majesty's Government could not commit themselves to such guarantees without further details, but that they would be prepared to take into consideration such financial losses as the Kawam-ul-Mulk might actually incur as the result of such hostilities. Sir C. Marling in his telegram No.718 of August 21st stated that between May 22nd end August 21st His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz had made payments amounting to One hundred and fifty-three thousand tomans,- of which the payment of Eighty-two thousand tomans was in connection with the Kawam-ul-Mulk and the remaining Seventy-one' thousand tomans was expended for payments to friendly Kashgais and other purposes. In reply to a ■ • telegram from this Office to the effect that these payments had not been sanctioned Sir C. Marling' explained in his telegram No*810 of the 11th ultimo that Colonel Gough had made these payments on his own responsibility he Under-Secretary of State, tut India Officet. •: : v)cc T.48,000 but that they bad been unavoidable in the circumstances It appears, however, that he only drew Seventy thousand t 7 0 00 tomans in connection with these payments on His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire, but proposed to draw a further sum of thirty-five thousand tomans from the same source. The balance of forty-eight thousand tomans was met by other funds at Colonel Gough's disposal. In his telegram No.759 of August 30th last Sir C. Marling stated that the Government of India had in l on ed hxm - tney considered this expenditure as jus tidied and that Colonel Gough should be authorised t0 i ncur a further expenditure of One hundred thousand T.100 000 tomans for the military operations of the Bakhtiari Khans and the Kawam-k-Mulk. it will thus be observed that the total proposed liability in this connection uncovered by any sanction amounts to Two iiuiiaaeo. ana L ivo 'thousand 'tomans* Mr. Balfour directs me to point out that, while Colonel Gough had no authority to make any payments in this connection, the situation at Shiraz at the time FaS ra ° St cmical ^-d that Colonel Gough was for some time completely Isolated and was thus compelled to adopt extraordinary measures to ensure that the Kawam-ul-Mulk &amp;n ° Ulu renaer ^equate assistance to repel the attacks of tie K^bi^is. In these circumstances Mr. Balfour hopes that M r .

His Majesty*s Consul says it is impossible to make nccurate estimate though he knows that property mentioned has actually been destroyed. He consxderes claim is undouot- edly exaggerated and tiiat if he were given tomans 50,000 he would still be over (? paid omitted)., Principal point, however, is that our promises should be cjnsideied trust worthy if we are to expect assistance in future ^ime of need.
