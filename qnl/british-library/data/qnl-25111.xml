IN the attached letter and Memorandum the Foreign Office have drawn the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to certain acts of Turkish aggression at various points in the Persian Gulf, which might in certain circumstances call for retaliatory measures on the part of His Majesty’s Government. They wish the Committee to consider “ what form local action in the Persian Gulf by His Majesty s Government had best take, what measures would be required of the Indian and Imperial naval and military forces, and what effect such action would be likely to have on Great Britain’s position in Egypt and India, and on her prestige in other Mahommedan countries.” 2. The attention of the Committee is drawn to the Report and Proceedings of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Bagdad Railway, Southern Persia, and the Persian Gulf, dated the 26th January, 1909, which contains a map, an index, and a good deal of information regarding the places mentioned in the foreign Office Memorandum. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., April 6, 1911.

THE only act of aggression taken by the Turks as regards Koweit is in connection with the Sheikh’s Fedhagia property. This is a large estate on the Shatt-el-Arab, purchased by the Sheikh about two years ago for £ T. 48,000. On previous occasions when the Sheikh has bought land in Turkey, he has had no difficulty in registering the transactions in the local land office. In the present case, the Office has refused registration unless the Sheikh enters himself as an Ottoman subject. This, acting on the advice of the British agent at Koweit, he has hitherto declined to do. [478]miNTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY J. \V. HAUK1HON.- 11/4/1911 2 There is, however, a constant possibility that Turkish aggression on Koweit might take a more direct form than this. Urn Kasr Fort, at the head of Khor the Sheikh’s territories. There has also been a small post on Warba and Bubian Islands, which are considered as being undoubtedly Koweit territory. But if the Turks really wished to encroach on Koweit, they would probable have very little difficulty in finding a plausible pretext. The embroilments which the Sheikh occasionally has with neighbouring tribes, such as that with the Muntafik Arabs in L910, might furnish the Turks with specious grounds for active intervention ; and, with the levelling tendencies which the present regime has displayed in various parts of the Empire, it can hardly be doubted that the Turks would welcome a pretext for action if other conditions were favourable to them. In such an eventuality, we might find Turkish soldiers at Koweit itself. This is a small sandy island about 10 miles south-east of Ujair* (the southernmost point to which His Majesty’s Government regard Turkish sovereignty as extending) and close to the mainland. It has been occupied by Turkish soldiers or gendarmes m 1909 and 1910. On each occasion the Porte has been informed that the island, is claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein, by whose subjects it has been used for fishing purposes, and that the presence of the Turkish flag constitutes an infringement of the status quo. On each occasion, in one manner or another, the island has been evacuated. These places are all situated on the coast of the Katr Peninsula, and are therefore regarded by His Majesty’s Government as being outside Turkish jurisdiction. At El Bidaa, however, the Turks have had a small military post since 1872, and though His Majesty’s Government have tolerated its existence for many years, they have never actually acquiesced in it. To the other three places the Turkish authorities, at one time or other during the past few years, have appointed Mudirs, but the officials have seldom proceeded to their posts. In 1895, His Majesty’s Government forcibly dispersed a settlement of Bahrein malcontents, who had settled at Zobara under the Turkish flag. In 1903 and 1904 there was an attempt to appoint a Mudir to Wakra, and a British warship was sent to prevent his landing. In 1910 the Vali of Bussorah appointed a Mudir to El Odeid, but, so far as is known, be has not attempted to proceed thither. Except with regard to Koweit and El Odeid, which is in the territory of the Trucial Chiefs, Turkish aggression threatens places of little intrinsic importance. But taken cumulatively, and in connection with questions arising in neighbouring parts of the Empire, their action might have considerable importance, and His Majesty’s Government might be forced to take local retaliatory measures. It is not possible to say beforehand what acts of aggression would call for such measures, as this would largely depend on the circumstances of the moment. But it is desirable now to consider what form local action in the Persian Gulf by His Majesty’s Government had best take, what measures would be required of the Indian and Imperial naval and military forces, and what effect such action would be likely to have on Great Britain s position in Egypt and India and on her prestige in other Mahommedan countries.

[558] LOCAL ACTION IN THE PERSIAN GULF. THE Foreign Office Memorandum, dated the 6th March, 1911 (C.LD. Paper 103-D)&gt; concerning'Turkish aggression in the Persian Gulf, which has been submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, concludes with the expression of an opinion that it is * desirable now to consider “ what form local action in the Persian Gulf by His Majesty’s Government had best take ; what measures would be required of the Indian and Imperial naval and military forces; and what effect such action would be likely to have on Great Britain’s position in Egypt and India and on her prestige in other Mahommedan countries.” In the absence of more definite and direct instructions, and with the object of answering such of these questions as concern the War Office, the following paper has been prepared by the General Staff. Although the suggestion of the Foreign Office does not go beyond purely local action in the Persian Gulf, it must be borne in mind that the outcome of local military action is not necessarily limited to the locality, but that such action may involve not only reprisals on the spot, but retaliatory action elsewhere. It is conceivable, though perhaps unlikely, that this would be the case in the present instance, and that Brit sh military action, though intended to be confined to the region of the Persian Gulf, might produce far-reaching effects in other directions. In any case, it seems desirable that military action with the object of bringing pressure to bear upon another Power should not be initiated without considering the possibility of its leading to strained relations and war with that Power. The situation appears to be as follows : The Sheikh of Koweit, whose territory at the head of the Gulf offers perhaps the best and most natural terminus for the Bagdad Railway, is not only friendly xo us, but is bound to Great Britain by Treaty engagements which place him in some measure under our protection. The temporary occupation of his territory by a British force might therefore seem the obvious step for us to take at this juncture, and one perhaps as well calculated as any other to enforce our views upon the Ottoman Government. On the other hand, while our occupation of Koweit would assert our influence over the Sheikh and his possessions, and to that extent would uphold British interests and prestige in the Gulf, it would not cause Turkey any material inconvenience or loss; and if she acquiesced in our remaining there, possibly under protest, it is not clear what permanent advantage we should have gained on the withdrawal of our troops. Forcibly to enter Turkish territory against the wish of its Mahommedan inhabitants would not only be an act of war against Turkey, but might arouse religious feeling among the more fanatic of the Mahommedan races. But to occupy territory which we claim as being under our protection with the good-will of its population is another matter, and might be agreeable rather than distasteful to the Mahommedans who think themselves oppressed under Turkish rule. The sympathies of the Arab tribes west of Koweit, which we should not be unlikely to secure, would further tend to strengthen our position. There appear to be no great military difficulties connected with this occupation, which would, it is assumed, be carried out by troops from India. The Turkish garrisons in these regions are small, amounting at present, perhaps, to no more than 800 men at Bussorah and Umkasr, with possibly a post on Warba Island. Further to the south, garrisoning the province of El Hasa upon the western sliore of the Gulf, there may be about 1,000 Turkish troops who would have a difficult desert march of from four to five days through a region by no means friendly to them, were they to move northwards. It is submitted that the British occupation, if decided on, should be confined to thePRINTED AT THE FOREION OFFICE BY J. W. HARRISON.— 2/5/1911. Sheikh of Koweit’s territory. The entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab is only guarded by a small fort at Fao, the capture of which would offer little difficulty; but it would seem desirable to avoid entering territory indisputably Turkish, or attacking Turkish forces unless these had invaded the Sheikh’s territory. It is, of course, possible that the Turks might anticipate us by occupying Koweit, over which they are understood to claim suzerainty, but such action, besides being damrerous in the face of the opposition of the Arabs, especially the Muntifik and other tribes west of the Euphrates, who are always in a state of partial revolt against Turkish rule, would be of so unfriendly a nature that it may be doubted whether the Turks would take it. Our occupation of Koweit might lead to the reinforcement of the Turkish garrison in and around Bussorah, but it may be that no deliberate attempt to turn us out of Koweit would be made. Moreover, there is no reason to suppose that even a comparatively small British force would be unable to hold its own in circumstances peculiarly favourable to defence, especially if supported by the Navy from the sea, and by the Arabs inland. The force to he dispatched from India should be as small as is consistent with safety, the climatic conditions in the Persian Gulf during the summer months being unfavourable. It might perhaps suffice to send two battalions of native infantry and a native mountain battery, together with personnel for a small camel corps, the camels being purchased on the spot. The opinion of the Indian military authorities should, however, be obtained as to the strength and composition of the force. It would also seem prudent that an adequate reinforcefnent should be held in readiness in India, and that arrangements should be made for its early dispatch should an emergency occur. It must be understood that the occupation of Koweit is only suggested as a means of temporarily putting pressure on Turkey without the use of actual force. The occupation is not suggested as the first step in an offensive campaign, nor should it be regarded as a preliminary to further operations in the direction of Bussorah or Bagdad. Such operations would not meet the contingency of a war with Turkey, and it is not proposed that in the event of war the British line of advance should ascend the valley of the Euphrates. As regards the possible effect of our occupation of Koweit in other directions, the Turkish countermove might take the form of a concentration of Turkish troops upon the eastern frontier of Egypt. Although the Turkish army is not just now in a position to undertake offensive operations upon a large scale, owing partly to the reorganisation which has only recently been begun, and partly to the troubles in Albania, with the Druses and in the Yemen, it is possible that a concentration on a moderate scale might be effected. This measure and a consequent stirring up of unrest in Egypt are not improbable, if we put pressure oh Turkey at Koweit or elsewhere. It seems important, therefore, that if it be decided to occupy Koweit we should be ready to reinforce the British garrison in Egypt, which at present is only sufficient for the preservation of internal order. It may be added that on its present footing, and pending the completion of the scheme of reorganisation now in pr ogress, the Turkish Army is calculated to provide 29 army corps of 1st line troops (18 cavalry brigades, and 58 divisions, of an aggregate strength of 25,000 cavalry, 580,000 infantry, and 1,600 guns). When the reorganisation is completed, the number of army corps will he increased to 38, with 20 reserve divisions in addition, giving a total of 14 cavalry brigades, and 92 divisions, of an aggregate strength of 25,000 cavalry, 920,000 infantry, and 2,200 guns. It is anticipated that the reorganisation will be completed in 1915 ; it will involve heavy expenditure on personnel and materiel, and it is possible that the requisite funds may not be forthcoming. The rank and tile of the Turkish Army are of excellent quality, and the training of the troops, especially in Europe, has greatly improved under their German instructional staff. Hitherto the w^eak spot in the army has been the officers, but here also a marked improvement has taken place both in the junior and in the senior ranks.

It is suggested that His Majesty’s Government should enter into negotiations with the lurkish Government, explaining to them fully their interests and policy in those regions, and that an attempt should be made to effect a general settlement on the lines recommended by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire in his telegram to the Government of India enclosed in your letter of the 9th December. Failing the success ol these negotiations, it is suggested that it would probably be necessary for His • ir St T) S . 0ve J? n S 1 r ent t0 assert by force their view of what constitutes the status quo m the Persian Gulf region. 1 !n the present disposition of the Turkish Government, Sir E. Grey considers it unlikely that they would approach such negotiations as are suggested in a reasonable spirit; and that, m view of the difficulty His Majesty’s Government would have in Imding a quid pro quo, it would be out of the question that the Turkish Government would make the concessions indicated in Colonel Cox’s telegram above referred to. In vi.ov^olrtho certamty of these negotiations ending in failure and of the serious steps cr 1 $ l n S ^ a J est -) TS brovemment might be forced to take consequent on such failure bir E. Grey won hi deprecate for the present any discussion with the Turkish Govern ment as to affairs of the Persian Gulf unless they should initiate them. The best moment for such negotiations would come when the Turkish Government aeain approach His Majesty s Government with a view to obtaining their assent to the 4 per cent, increase of the customs duties. It will then be necessary to discuss the question of Koweit in connection with the Bagdad Railway, and by using the customs increa.se as a lever it may be possible to obtain a satisfactory arrangement about Koweit and other places on the Persian Gulf. Till His Majesty’s Government obtain this they can at any rate withold their consent to the increase of customs duties and if a breach with Turkey must come, it would be better that it should come on this’ground than on the ground of negotiations initiated by His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Persian Gulf questions only. s As to removing by force signs of Turkish authority from places where their rights are not admitted, the question must first be considered how the Turkish authorities can be prevented from replacing them once they are removed. Where an island is concerned no difficulty would arise; but it would be useless to expel a small Turkish force on the mainland from a place which Turkey can reoccupy with a larger force subsequently, kuch action might lead to a situation of which the only solution would be a war with Turkey, and the question should be considered as to what should be done m sudi a case and what complications in Egypt or India might be involved by war -turkey; Iu ^ S , lr E ;, .W considers that it would not be safe to press matters so far till the naval and military authorities are known to be agreed upon a plan of campaign, and prepared to carry it out in the last resort. f f ui For these reasons Sir E Grey, though appreciating the inconvenience of the p ifsent unsettled and undefined state of affairs, considers that, unless extreme provo cation is forthcoming, it would be better to wait till the Turkish Government renew th is year their request for the increase of customs dues, and then to open the question ol ail the points m dispute and to endeavour to secure a reasonable settlement.

In view of the certainty of these negotiations ending in failure and of the serious steps which His Majesty's Government might he forced to take consequent on such failure. Sir E. Grey would deprecate for the present any discussion with the Turkish Government as to affairs of the Per sian Gulf unless they should initiate them. The best moment for such negotiations would come when the Turk ish Government again approach His Majesty's Government with a view to obtaining their assent to the four per cent increase of the Customs duties. It will then he necessary to discuss the question of Koweit in connexio with the Bagdad Railway and by using the Customs in crease as a lever it may he possible to obtain a satis-y-f (47123/10) satisfactory arrangement about Koweit and other places on the Persian Gulf. Till His Majesty's Government oh tain this they can at any rate withhold their consent to the increase of Customs duties and if a breach with Turkey must come, it would be better that it should come on this ground than on the ground of negotiations initiated by His Majesty's Government in regard to the Persian Gulf questions only. As to removing by force signs of Turkish authority from places where their rights are not admitted, the question must first be considered how the Turkish au thorities can be prevented from replacing them once they are removed. Where an island is concerned, no difficulty would arise, but it would be useless to ex pel a small Turkish force on the mainland from a piece which Turkey can reoccupy with a larger force subse quently. Such action might lead to a situation of which the only solution would be a war with Turkey, and the question should be considered as to what should be done in such a case, and what complications in Egypt or India might be involved by war with Turkey. In fact Sir4-2 (47123/10) Sir E. Grey considers that it would not he safe to press matters so far till the naval and military au thorities are known to he agreed upon a plan of cam paign and prepared to carry it out in the last resort. For these reasons Sir E. Grey though appreciating the inconvenience of the present unsettled and undefin ed state of affairs, considers that unless extreme pro vocation is forthcoming it would he better to wait till the Turkish Government renew this year their request for the increase of Customs dues and then to open the question of all the points in dispute and to endeavour to secure a reasonable settlement.

From—L ihottoiot A. T. W.mov, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul for To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the marginally noted correspondence on the ' to Ambassador, No. 22 , subject of the particular incident 'which gave rise to the Shaikh’s recent difficulties with the Turks, as a direct consequence of which the Turkish Gunboat JHannavis shelled the village of Zain. (1) Consul, Basrab dated 23rd April 1910. (2) Consul, Mohammerab, to Eesident, No. 423, dated 30tb April 1910. (3) Consul, Mohammerab, to Resident, No. 566, dated 4th June 1910. (Extracts attached for reference.) 2. On Tuesday night, October 18th, according to information communi cated to me and confirmed by Haji Rais and Mirza Hamza, a concerted attack was made by a number of Arabs upon the agent and fallahs of Muhammad-al- Mishn occupying date plantations in Fadaghia (which adjoin those of Shaikh Mubarak) half-way between Basrah and Fao. News of the occurrence reached Mohammerah on the 19th and on the evening of the 20th the Mar marts went down to Fadaghia to enquire into the case of the disturbance. The Tabur Agassi was on board. 3. It appears that the fallahs (subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerah) whom the Turks evicted from the lands in April, took refuge with Naghaimish- bin-Ibrahim-bin-Naghaimish, a petty Shaikh who, with his followers, lives at Ma’amir near Fao, and who was concerned in the piracy of a Persian boat on 8th March. His name is as now given and not as stated in correspondence on the subject of that incident. They were replaced in Mishri’s lands by other tribesmen of the Shaikh, the Chief headmen of whom were named Humaiyid, M’atuq and Ishaq. 4. It appears that the Kaimmakam of Fao recommended to the new Vali of Basrah that the old fallahs, who had taken refuge with Naghaimish, should be reinstated in their old homes, and that the Vali approved of the suggestion. The Kaimmakam then gave orders to the Turkish police officer (chaush) in 1602 F. D,2 Eadaghia to reinstate the said fallaks and remove those who had taken their place. The police officer referred the matter to his official superior, who told him not to obey the Kaimmakam, and some time was spent in the exchange of letters on this subject between the various officials concerned. 5. At last the fallahs, in whose favour the Vali had decided, incited, it is said, by Shaikh Naghaimish, and perhaps with the tacit approval of the Kaimmakam of Eao, attacked the date groves in force, together with the agent of Mishri, and looted dates and other property. They are at the time of writing still in possession. There was a good deal of firing on both sides, but no lives were lost. 6. The foregoing version is that which I have been able to obtain locally. The absence of the Shaikh at Ahwaz makes it impossible for me to discuss the question with him, but I understand that Shaikh Mubarak was near the land in question, in his yacht, on Tuesday night, and that he has written to the Shaikh on the subject. 7. It is not impossible that the incident may be utilised by the Turks as a peg on which to hang accusations against the Shaikh, and I have therefore thought it advisable to report the matter in detail. On the information before me, it appears that the incident arises principally out of the dissensions between Turkish officials concerned, and their inability to control Shaikh Naghaimish, which was evinced in so marked a degree during the enquiry by them into the piracy on the 7th March. Extract from Mr. Consul Crow’s despatch, No. 22 of 23rd April 1910, to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Constantinople. ***** Last month Muhammad Bey-al-Mishri applied to the Turkish authorities in the usual way to remove certain fellahs from his property at Dawasir. The authorities tried to carry out the orders given for their removal but without success, and the trespassers were supported in their attitude to the local authorities by one Muhammad-al-Kanan, who with his followers lives at Zain on Turkish territory. The Vali sent the Tabur Agassi with 15 gendarmes to arrest Muhammad- al-Kanan. This they were not able to do, and were informed, in answer to their demands, that all the people there belonged to Shaikh Khazal, and were unable to come to Basrah, and if the arrest were insisted on, the agent of Muhammad Bey-al-Mishri would be killed in the same way as Kasim Chelmeran. * * * • * Extract from Mr. A. T. Wilson’s letter, No. 423 of SOth April 1910,. to the Political Resident t Bush ire. ***** 7. The case of Muhammad g, Mishri ^ has another aspect. The “ removal of fellahs in the usual way ” is a guphemi^m for an attempt on the part of the ■ Turks to oust the tenants of certain lands, alleged to be Persian subjects, ! without reference to the Turkish Courts of law, in favour of the Turkifh owner. It is not stated who gave the message to the Tabur Agassi that Mishri would be killed in the same way as Chelmeran, if the arrest of Muhammad-al-Kanan were insisted on. It is strenuously denie:l,d and seems inherently improbable, that Muhammad-al-Kanan, or his men, would have been so foolish as to utter such a threat to 15 armed gendarmes on Turkish soil# The story is not unlikely to be a fabrication on the part of Turkish subordinate officials with the object of causing trouble between the Shaikh and the Vali. * * * * £Extract from a. letter, No. 566, dated 4th June 1910, from His Majesty's Consul, 7. The Shaikh replies that the “ trespassers ' whom Mishri tried to have Mishri, a Turkish landowner, applied to the ? em0Ved ^ the “ ^SUal Way ” Were SUb- Turkish authorities in the usual wav to remove lects of his and belonged to thft Persian success. Mishri then proposed to replace them with other Arabs of the tribe of ammad Kanan, but the latter tribal Chief refused to let any men of his tribe replace Haji Faisal’s men, as this would give rise to a blood-feud, or at least to much bitterness. Mishri was very angry at this, and made a bid case of it. ile tola lies to the Yali, and to the police, and, as far as the Shaikh can make out, the story of his or of his agent’s life being threatened by Muhammad £anan is based solely in Mishri’s word, or that of the police. Muhammad Aanan did not do so, nor any responsible person. 8. The Shaikh replies that Muhammad Kanan is a Persian subject, that Reference above complaint, the Turkish police Wrote as much to the Yali at the time, were informed when they tried to arrest Muham- The TabUT Agassi (police Sergeant) Went swt K h7nd tdi'nt to Zainto arrest Muhammad kanan, but imprisoned) and if arrest was insisted on, alleged no specific offence, except that he Mishn s agent would be killed like Chelmeran. had been annoying Mishri, who is a i 9 iO) r ’ Crow8 ^)espatch, X0, 23 of 23nd A P ril tyrannical and grasping man.

The Council withheld their consent. Vali then despatched a tele gram to Constantinople that the attack, which occurred the day after Shaikh Khazal had been decorated by the English, was instigated by the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait. The Marmaris, which returned from Fada- ghia, has, I see, got steam up again, and in view of possible developments, I hasten to communicate this to you.” _EWs I beg to suggest, in view of the above, that a gunboat be immediately despatched to Mohammerah.

The Mar mar is, which returned to Basrah on the 24th, passed Moham- merah on her way down river at 10-30 a,m., on the 26th. I have, up to the time of writing, no further information as to her doings. 4. The Shaikh, who is at Ahwaz, on hearing of the attack on Mishri’s property at once wired to Mirza Hamzah to impound all dates found on the Persian side of the river which there might be reason to suspect of having been looted from the Eadaghia lands, and to comply with any legal demands that the Turks might make for the arrest of Arabs, accused of complicity in the outrage, who might have taken refuge in Persian territory. 5. I am informed that the gunboat Marmaris, on the 22nd and 23rd, landed parties of soldiers at several points down the Turkish shore, and attempted to find the various headmen and interrogate them, but found that they had all prudently absented themselves, and that their whereabouts were unknown. Naghaimish in particular, with the bulk of his tribe and all his family, has disappeared for the moment. 6. It is stated that he even went so far as to send a sowar to near Saihan to cut the telegraph line there so as to prevent the officials at Eao from wiring to Basrah for reinforcements. 7. Mr. Consul Crow’s letter of 24th instant confirms in general the version of the affair which I gave in my letter No. 1175, of the 22nd instant, though I was unaware that Sulaiman Nazif, the late Yali, had taken a personal part in arranging for the return of the old fallahs. His action confirms in a striking way Shaikh Khazal’s defence of Muhamad-al-Kanan’s action in April 1910, which was the cause of the attack on Zain by the Turks. 8. I am sending copies of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister, His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, and the Political Agent, Kuwait. 9. A robbery accompanied by the murder of two persons, with two severely wounded, took place in Basrah on the night of the 24th instant. It is supposed to have been instigated by the family of Mishri, in order to raise resentment against the Shaikh, against whose door it will be laid, and in order to spur the Yali to some violent action. 10. The Shaikh has wired to Haji Rais to take the advice of His Majesty’s Consul in regard to all action proposed by him in regard to the recent occurrence, and to do nothing without his sanction.

The gardens were attacked on Tuesday night, October 18th, by Arabs and a large quantity of dates were stolen. On October 20 th the Kaimakam of Fao icpoi ed the attack and said the dates had been carried- off in several boats to the Persian side. The Mishris then put in a complaint to the Vilayat to the same effect, stating their loss to be 6,000 Turkish liras (sic) and alleging that the robbers numbered 500 persons (sic). Both these figures are no doubt grossly exaggerated. Instructions were then given to the Marmaris to proceed to the scene of the robbery and the vessel left on October 20 th with about 30 gendarmes under a Colagasi, Shukri Efifendi, who was instructed to enquire and report. On arrival at Fadaghia they heard some of the robbers were still in possession, and several shots were tired in the air but, finding no one there, the vessel left again for Fao. i • jnecaBing on the Yali on October 24th on the occasion of the Sultan’s mrtnday, 1 asked him if he had any cause to suspect support or instigation from Shaikh Khazal s people in the attack and he said : “ Ummam,’’ i. e., 1 do not believe so. “ The Shaikh was away at the time up the Karun and tne attacx was made by the Arabs and was an ordinary affair for purposes of robbery such as often occurs in the district.” The Yali distinctly gave me ^understand that he did not think the attack had any connection with o ammerah.

I shall send a copy of this letter in due course to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Mohammerah, 29th October 1910. My dear Crow, I am informed by the local authorities here that according to a report received today from Haji Sultan, the Marmaris, during her stay at Fao (Wednesday evening to Friday morning), dropped a mark on the river between herself and the Persian shore, just opposite some huts occupied by pearlers known as Sa’adun, and commenced rifle practice at it. Almost all the bullets went far over the mark, and forced the occupants of the huts to fly : bellams going up and down the bank had to 'stop, and sailing vessels in the vicinity were much inconvenienced. No one was hit, fortunately, as all in the vicinity of the said mark had the good sense to fly for their lives. It seems probable that the Commander of he Marmaris did this in order to induce some one to fire hack at him, which would have given him an excuse to open fire with his guns. I do not suppose for a moment that the Wali of Basrah has cognizance of such pranks, hut I inform you of them, in case you may see an opportunity of bringing them to notice. Bifle practice in a narrow river devoted to interna tional commerce is surely reprehensible, apart from; any other considerations in view of the dense population on either bank. I am in possession of specimen bullets. A copy of this goes this mail to Bushire. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. 1719 F. D.fT3 3 v. 4 According to my information, Mishri’s people telegraphed to the Yali from Asshar to Basrah some days before October 18th and asked him to protect their gardens at Fadaghia, as they heard they were about to be attacked and plundered.

O n arrival at Padaghia they heard some of the robbers were still in pos- session and several shots were fired in the air, but finding no one there the vessel left again for Fao. • ca 1 llin ' ? n on October 24th on the occasion of the Sultan’s birthday I asked him if he had any cause to suspect support or instigation from Shaikh Khazzal s people in the attack, and he said, “I do not believe so. Shaikh Khazzal was away at the time up the Karun, and the attack was made by the Arabs, and was an ordinary affair for purposes of robbery, such as often occurs m this district.” He distinctly gave me to understand that he did not think the attack had any connection with Mohammerah. I then told him according to my informa tion, the trouble was caused by Mishri’s evicted fallahs, but if he had reason to suppose it was otherwise, and had any complaint to make against Mohammerah, 1 should he glad to know as we were interested in the maintenance of friendly relations between Basrah and Mohammerah, and, though I was aw^are he dis- H . k fi intervention, yet I was ready to assist him' in putting the matter nght it he would tell me what the trouble was. He thanked me, and said it was also in their interest to maintain friendly relations with the Shaikh, but the affair was as I had stated and nothing was required. On the following day I received news which leads me to think that the Wali misled me with a pur pose and wilfully lied to me. My dragoman obtained confidential information that on October 20 th four days before my interview the Vali, in discussing the Mishn incident with his Administrative Council, verbally asked them to give their decision to attack Pallahiyah and Mohammerah. The Council did not consent to this, and the Valias proposal was not recorded, but His Excellency then telegraphed to Constantinople to the effect that the attack was instigated by Shaikhs Khazzal and Mubarak and occurred the day after the former had been decorated by the English. c^ Se 7l C r eC ^ fallahs, according to Mr. Wilson’s report, are subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerah residing in Turkey, one would reasonably suppose that the Turks, if they wanted the Shaikh to recover the stolen property and punish the fallahs, would address the Shaikh on the subject before resortin o* to such an extreme measure as that indicated by the Vali’s proposal to his Council. But I am informed by Mr. Wilson that up to the 25th instant no communication from the Basrah authorities had been received by the Shaikh on the subject. J Demi-official, dated the 28th October 1910.

Dates , Syrup of dates Liras Rupees . 1,190 karas, 785 tins, also 120 50 Shaikh and Turks*6 2 . His Majesty’s Consul forwarded copies of the correspondence to me with a request that I would ascertain w hat was known to Shaikh Mubarak of the facts, as he was near the spot in his yacht at about the time of the occur rence. 3. Shaikh Mubarak in describing the affair said that though he passed the gardens in question he saw no signs of any unusual movement of boats or ^ “ bellams”. The following morning when anchored off Eao he heard of the raid and learnt that some 200 fellahin who bad worked for generations in these gardens and been evicted six months or more ago and who had taken up their xesidence with bin ^aghaimish at Mhhamir, had gone off the previous evening accompanied, by another 100 of Mahamir men ^ (followers of Naohai- mish apparently) and raided the gardens, driven off bin Mishri’s watchers, and removed the dates. Later he heard they had been joined by other men from Ziyadiah, Dowasir and the vicinity, attracted by the prospect of loot and that altogether some 400 “ karas ” of dates had been taken. He added that he made particular enquiries as to whether any men from the Persian side of the river had been concerned and heard that none were j implicated. The raid was in revenge for eviction and managed, so far as any concerted action may have been led by anyone in particular, by bin Naghai- mish. Shaikh Mubarak said that the Kaim Makam at Fao was well aware of the true facts and indeed had been previously warned by bin Naghaimish that the evicted “ fellahin ” would retaliate unless their wrongs were redressed. The first news received at lao came from the Turkish Police-Post near Fadaghia, which reported a raid by 1,000 of Shaikh Khazzal’s men, a number preposter ously exaggerated by the chaush ” of police in order to saddle the blame of Turkish mishandling of the original dispute on the Shaikh of Mohammerah. 4. The Shaikh also said that his Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim, was in Basrah at the time and^the Vali, Jelal Bey, was then satisfied that Shaikhs Mubarak and Khazzal were not concerned in any way and that it was the result of evicting bin Mishri’s fellahin six months ago. The Vali made en quiries from Shaikh Saleh bin Ibrahim, and Shaikh Mubarak suggested that His Majesty’s Consul would obtain the actual facts in detail if lie enquired from this man. 5. As to the rights of the original quarrel Shaikh Mubarak informed me that the usual custom is for the fellahin to receive a fourth or more of the produce of all full grown trees, that these fellahin had for s weral generations been on the ground and the present gardens were the result of the labours ol their tore-fathers and themselves. Bin Mishri desired to reduce their share of the produce very considerably, which they naturally resented. They appealed to the late Vali, Suliman Nathif Bey, but failed to get any redress, and were evicted. They nursed their grievance until a favourable opportunity presented itself and then took revenge in the usual way by a raid. 6 . Shaikh Mubarak added that he doubted if many of the fellahin concerned were Shaikh Khazzal’s subjects for they had been domiciled so long in bin Mishri s lands that several of them at any rate would be in possession of Turkish nationality certificates. 7.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 5.) (No. 865.) Sir, Constantinople, November 29, 1910. THE surmise that I ventured to make in my despatch No. 843 of the 22nd instant, that it was the intention of the “ committee ” to bring about the recall and disgrace of Nazim Pasha, appears to receive confirmation from a recent telegram I have received from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad, reporting the rumours current as to the mission of Ismail Hakki Bey Babanzadeh. Mr. Lorimer says that the supposed object of his visit was to report on (1) Muntefik affairs ; (2) British designs on Bussorah ; and (3) Mazim Pasha’s conduct of affairs generally, and that one result of the reports sent by the deputy in a secret cypher to the Grand Vizier and Minister of War is that Nazim has been instructed to proceed to the Muntefik country, an order which the vali is very reluctant to obey. Ismail Hakki has also been instructed to report whether, in his opinion, Nazim Pasha should be entrusted with the expenditure of the loan which the municipality of Bagdad is contracting with the National Bank. Sir H. Babington Smith informs me that that operation, which was being discussed in the Council of Ministers, has now been referred back to the Council of State merely to give time for Ismail Hakki’s report to reach Constantinople, and it seems to be a legitimate inference that the Council of Ministers expect a report adverse to the vali. In my above-mentioned despatch I reported that Ismail Hakki had also been deputed to examine the complaints, both foreign and native, as to the recent arbitrary demolitions of house property, &amp;c. The “ Tanin,” of the 25th, gives some extracts— translation of which I have the honour to transmit to you—of his reports, which in substance amount to a damaging criticism of the proceedings carried out in the vali’s name. It is taken for granted that compensation will be paid to those who have suffered by the projected street improvements, and it is suggested that 10 per cent., or even 20 per cent., more than the sums now being offered would be well spent if the public excitement can thereby be calmed. Rifaat Pasha, to whom I spoke on this question yesterday, informed me that compensation would certainly be paid, but he would not commit himself to promising that the sums claimed would be paid in full. I told him that Mr. Lorimer had been called on to furnish a list, carefully revised by himself, of British claims, and that I should present it as soon as it reached me, with a request for a settlement in full. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1 . Extract from the “ Tanin ” of November 25, 1910. (Translation.) The Possibility of Prosperity for Bagdad. NAZIM PASHA desires to widen the streets of the town, particularly those suitable for electric tramways. Probably about 90,000i. of the Bagdad loan will be devoted to constructing a road 22 metres wide as nearly as possible parallel to the river. This is a very necessary project, but it has given rise to a great deal of talk. Some suggest making the road farther from the river, where it would contribute to the prosperity of the outlying parts, while costing only one-third as much as the projected road ; but the road is needed in the commercial part of the town, and would be useless in open ground. Some do not wish to be compelled to leave houses in which their families have lived for generations, wdiile others are doubtful whether they will get compensation if their houses are demolished. Everyone is in a state of anxiety ; but this feeling of fear and apprehension can be dispelled by repeated notices, by influential [1814 e—3][This iJocuireent is the Propeity of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.} Mr. Marling to Sir Edicard Greg.—(Received November 28.) (No. 843.) Sir, Pera, November 23, 1910. WITH reference to your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October and Sir Gerard Lowther’s despatch No. 797 of the 31st October concerning the arbitrary and aggressive proceedings of the Ottoman local authorities in Bagdad and Bussorah, I have the honour to enclose paraphrases of two telegrams from His Majesty’s consul at Bagdad, reporting that the property numbered No. 6 in his despatch No. 42 of the 5 th September has been demolished under circumstances of injury and insult, that the authorities had given notice of their intention to expropriate part of Messrs. Lynch’s head offices at a price little more than a third of that estimated by their local manager, that it is rumoured locally that the temporary permission to tow barges given in 1899 is about to be withdrawn, and that the general effect produced on British subjects was so deplorable that some of them—presumably Indian Moslems—were actually becoming Ottoman subjects mainly owing to the apparent inability of the British authorities to afford them proper protection. Mr. Lorimer also expresses the opinion that the Bagdad municipal loan should not be entrusted to the present local Government, or in any case should not be given until the question of compensation to British subjects has been settled. I have further just received a written unofficial communication from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, complaining that Lynch’s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad or Bussorah. As regards the demolitions, Sir Gerard Lowther in his telegram No. 246 of the 11 th instant reported to you that the Minister of the Interior had practically decided to indemnify the owners for their losses, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave me a similar assurance again yesterday morning. The Minister of the Interior has, moreover, declared that the Government has decided to pay such indemnities “ should it be proved that the regulations on the subject have been contravened.” In reply to the remark that after the buildings were removed it was difficult to prove that they were not in a dangerous state before demolition, he replied that there had also been numerous strong complaints from natives whose property had been similarly treated, that the matter might come up in Parliament, that one of the Bagdad committee deputies had received secret instructions to investigate the whole affair, that his conclusions seemed most damaging to the vali, that both native and foreign subjects would have to be indemnified, and that all his (the Minister’s) colleagues were in favour of recalling Nazim Pasha. General Nazim Pasha has the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian, and is rather the type of a blunt soldier who is ignorant, as his recent methods at Bagdad have shown, of the niceties of civil administration. As you are aware, he has been an opponent of the committee, and early in 1909 was suddenly appointed Minister of War by Kiamil Pasha, with the idea of compelling the officers to cease dabbling in politics. This excited the fierce anger of the committee, who promptly brought about the violent and unconstitutional fall of the Grand Vizier and his new War Minister. Again, after the mutiny of the 13th April, 1909, Nazim Pasha incurred the displeasure of the committee by accepting the post of commander of the mutinous Constantinople army corps, which he reduced to order, and advocated punishing without the interven tion of the Macedonian forces. Being popular with the rank and file his presence in the capital was irksome to the committee, who apparently resolved to send him to the distant post of Bagdad, with the ulterior object of ruining his reputation and dismissing him as a failure. It is not impossible that Nazim Pasha’s arbitrary methods of improving Bagdad were indirectly suggested to him by some member of the committee with a view to compassing his downfall, and it seems undoubted that they would like to be able to say that his recall was due to the English, to whom Nazim was reputed to be friendly. It is on this account that in our written and verbal complaints about the recent high-handed proceedings at Bagdad this embassy has been careful to omit any mention of his name, and to refer always to “ the local authorities ” or “ the Bagdad [2988 ee — 1 ]municipality.” There seems little douht now that Nazim Pasha’s tenure of office at Bagdad will not last long. With reference to Mr. Lorimer’s suggestion that steps might be taken to defer the conclusion of the Bagdad municipal loan, I do not see how, in view of recent events, the embassy could approach the National Bank with that object. As regards the expropriation of Messrs. Lynch’s head offices, I have caused the Minister ot the Interior to telegraph to the vali to see that the provisions of the Expropriation Law are not departed from, and informed Mr. Lorimer that, unless the authorities offer a reasonable price, Messrs. Lynch’s agent should, if necessary, bring an action within fifteen days, as prescribed. I have further had the Minister of the Interior’s attention drawn to the threatened withdrawal of Messrs. Lynch’s permission to tow barges, and to the fact that the existing accumulation of cargo at Bussorah makes it very inopportune to raise the question at the present moment. In view of the present frame of mind of the Turkish authorities, they would not now be likely to entertain the suggestion in Messrs. Lynch’s letter of the 21st October and that of the 10th November, 1910, enclosed in your despatches Nos. 335 and 346 of the 31st October and the loth November respectively, that they should be allowed to use a fourth steamer to help to work off the congestion at Bussorah. In the Euphrates and ligris Steam Navigation Company’s letter of the 10th November it is stated that Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery has been granted a permit to run steamers between Bagdad and Bussorah, and that this gentleman is understood to be in close touch with the agents of the German Hamburg-Amerika line. At first sight it is difficult to see why Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Bagdad should not be in as close if not closer touch with Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery. The communication from the Porte complaining that Messrs. Lynch’s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad and Bussorah seemed to contest the right of the original two steamers to carry the British flag. I at once caused energetic representations to be made on the subject, with the result that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs now declares that probably the local authorities confounded the two original steamers with the third steamer, for which permission was granted in January 1907, with the proviso that it should fly the Ottoman flag, and that their complaints refer only to alleged “ irregularities ” ot the third steamer. As regards the decision prohibiting the registration of Sheikh KazaTs lands at lailieh, the Porte has hinted that representations on the subject would more properly come from the Persian Embassy here, but has promised to re-examine the matter. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to try and arrange that the sheikhs agent should move the new vali at Bussorah to again refer the matter to Constantinople for reconsideration. In a telegram of the 14th November, His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah reported from Bushire that the “ Redbreast ” had visited Wakra and Odeid and found no sign of Turkish mudirs at those places, while, as reported in my telegram No. 248 of the 14th instant, His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire has since reported the desertion of the Turkish post at Zakhnuniyeh. I would venture to suggest, for your consideration, the advisability of sending the “ Redbreast ” to Zakhnuniyeh to ascertain whether any Turkish gendarmes are still there, and whether, as previously reported, the Turkish flag is still at the bottom of the mast. The visit of a British ship is certain to be reported, and its importance magnified by the local Arabs up to Bussorah and Bagdad, and its effect may counteract to a certain extent the deplorable impression among British subjects at Bagdad caused by the high-handed action of the Turkish local authorities. The fact that this despatch is a report on some of the questions forming the subject of your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October must be my excuse for including in it more than one subject-matter. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . ( 1 onsul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther, (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 12, 1910. REFERRING to my telegram of the 8 th instant and to your Excellency’s telegram of the 10 th instant, I regret to report that British reputation at Bagdad has fallen to avery low ebb, and I find that British subjects are seriously alarmed, seeing that their rights have never hitherto been so trampled upon here. For four months past they have been suffering from illegal oppression, from which there is no sign of any redress to come visible. A prosperous merchant, Abdul Ali, has talked of renouncing his British nationality for Turkish, and several British Indians have actually done so. If I have so far failed to show your Excellency the serious nature of the situation, it has been only because I was unwilling to appear alarmist. The vali is incompetent, and under the influence of unscrupulous and ignorant underlings, and it is with regret that I am reduced to the conviction that he must be removed and replaced by a more intelligent man. Yesterday they demolished part of the two storied building, No. 6 , with circum stances of injury and insult, and have continued doing so to-day. The violence of the local authorities increases daily, and I can only conclude the Minister of the Interior is misleading your Excellency. The vali appears to treat the question as a personal one, and the next thing will be expropriations, which will cause great and as yet unforeseen losses ^to British subjects if carried out on the same lines as the demolitions. Could your Excellency not obtain compensation in even one case ? It would to some extent allay the panic. Immediate payment to the ice manufacturer, whose case is clear, would effect this purpose. The Bagdad municipality loan should not, I think, be entrusted to the present local Government, or, at any rate, not given till the amount of compensation payable to British subjects for the demolitions and prospective expropriations has been discussed and approved by His Majesty’s Embassy. The loan will certainly be misspent, and the city will thus be saddled to no purpose with a heavy debt for a generation. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther. (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 14, 1910. REFERRING to my telegram of the 12th November last, I anticipate that I shall soon learn that a block of lofty houses owned by some Indian nawabs, to which I did not refer in my despatch of the 5th September last, will have been expropriated on scandalously unfair conditions. Meanwhile, notice has been sent to Lynch’s manager of the expropriation of 3|- metres from the front of his office and warehouse, the expropriation to take effect in fifteen days, and compensation being fixed at 424 Turkish liras only. The unscrupulous character of the proceedings is shown by the fact that Lynch’s manager estimates the cost of rebuilding on a new alignment would amount to some 1,184 liras, while the estimate made in my despatch of the 5th September came to 1,250 liras. The total claim made by Lyncb amounts to 2,396 liras, i.e., for buildings which will now be expropriated 1,828 liras, for wall and shops wrongfully demolished 568 liras, though there is perhaps room for discussion regarding the items of the cost of recon struction. I fear that a grave blow would be struck at British prestige, from which it will not easily recover, if Lynch’s office and warehouse are destroyed and no proper compensation first fixed. It is absolutely necessary that the vilayet’s proceedings should be checked, and the view is gaining ground here that the British Government cannot protect its subjects in Turkey.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 46211 / 10 . and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, —.

As regards the suggestion that Kis Majesty's Ship 'Redbreast' should visit the Island of Zakhnuniyeh I am to acquaint you that Kis Majesty's Ship 'Redbre8st ,, has temporar ily left the Persian Gulf and is now being refitted at Bombay. The approaches to the island are unsurveyed and reported to be full of dangerous shoals; it is probable, however, that one of the ships employed in the ams traffic blockade could, ii navigated v/ith great care, approach the island within two or three miles. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. 3.3. Their Lordships would be prepared to direct the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies to send a vessel to the island, provided that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers the matter to be of sufficient importance to justify the withdrawal of a vessel from the blockade, and the navigational risks which would be incurred. It is desirable in any case that the vessel should be absent from the blockade for as short a time as possible. 4. As however His Majesty’s Consul Greneral at Eushire has reported that the Turkish post on the island has been deserted, it is not clear that anything would be gained by sending a ship there and it is suggested as preferable that the Commander-in-Chief East Indies, who is now in the Persian Gulf, should be informed of the objects which the Secretary of State desires to attain, and that the action to be taken should be left to his discretion. 5. Their Lordships presume that the Commander-in-Chief's proposal to visit Bagdad which was not approved (vide Foreign Office letter of the 13th instant) w^as made in order that he might have an opportunity of ascertaining the stateL\ state of affairs personally. 6.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1 . Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 54.) Si r , Bussorah, September 16, 1910. I LEARN privately that Hikmet Pasha, the commodore, recently sent a report to the Minister of Marine to the effect that if he was not supplied with another gun-boat and a transport-ship the English were likely to take Bussorah. About two weeks ago the vali received an urgent telegram on the subject, asking him to report the facts. The yali replied that he noticed no indications of such an intention on the part of the English, and that the report was unfounded, but, in any case, a gun-boat and a transport-ship would not prevent them. Hikmet Pasha seems to have won the confidence of Nazim Pasha, the Vali of Bagdad, and is undoubtedly intriguing against Suleiman Nazif Bey, the Vali of Bussorah, with whom he is not at present on speaking terms. I understand their differences are partly due to questions relating to the provisioning of the naval barracks and the crew of the “Marmaris,” and partly to an unjustifiable claim put forward by Hikmet Pasha for a sumptuary allowance of 15 liras a-month for the entertainment of foreigners, which sum he asked to be paid out of the vilayet revenue. The vali said he did not entertain, and was not entitled to the allowance. The arrangements for pajdng the “ fleet ” seem somewhat imperfect, and the quarrel may have been embittered by the reported action of the captain of the gun-boat stationed near Ghermet Ali, above Bussorah, who is alleged to have invited the local mal mudiri to pay him an official visit on the national fete day and to have arrested him on board during the visit because he had not paid the captain’s salary. The mal mtidiri is said to have paid up, but complained to the vali that the captain had spoilt his fete day. Hikmet Pasha seems to have decided anti-English proclivities, and is no doubt nettled by our unwillingness to assist him in his schemes for the improvement of the bar, reported in my despatches Nos. 37, 40, and 44, of the 22nd June and the 1st and 12th July respectively. His mendacious reports respecting British action in regard to Bussorah may be due to spite or to a desire to attract public attention. He seems ill qualified to occupy a position of importance.

This Ali is the nephew of Ibrahim who was until recently the Mudir of Ojair and he is thus acquainted with the internal workings of the Hasa Office. 2. When Suad Beg, Mutasarrif of Hasa returned to Ojair in the S* S* 'John 0 f Scott' on the 5th August 1910 (vide diary No, 280) after temporarily acting as Yali of Basrah, he brought with him two men, one named Sulaiman Effendi and the other is named Abdullah Effendi (mixed negro blood)• He first wished to appoint Abdullah as Mudir of Ayun, and Sulaiman as Mudir of Odaid, but at the request of the latter the two appointments were interchanged. Thepay of these posts is said to be 60 Rials each* 3. The name of the Mudir of Zubarah is also Abdullah Effendi, not however to be confused with the Abdullah Effendi, of negro blood. 4. I can still find no corroboration of the appoint ment of a Mudir for Tfakrah, on the contrary this rumour is denied to have foundation. 5.

Like his predecessor (see my despatch No. 878), he will certainly decline to entertain, even unofficially, representations from us on behalf of sheikh.

It will be seen from this despatch that Mr. 'arling has suggested that His Majesty's Ship 'Red breast * should visit the Island of Zakhnunlyeh, between Bahrain and the mainland. In regard to this Island I am to explain that though the ownership of the is- -land Is claimed by the ’helkh of Bahrein, the Turkish authorities have on more than one oecaalon recently i sent ftie Secretary of the Admiralty.(44632/10J S3 cent soldiera and gendarmes thither who have hoisted the Turkish flag in violation of the existing status quo.

The Vali replied that he had not at present received any telegram on this subject; that the island belonged to Turkey and that this Consulate had no right to enquire into their affairs either officially or privately. His Excellency then told my dragoman that he was astonished that the Consul, whose business it was to watch trade, should interfere in political matters. My dragoman asked him to explain more precisely what he meant but he dropped the sub ject and on being informed that most of the people who fished in the island2 were foreigners, and that the enquiry on my part was justifiable, His Excel lency was good enough to say that, if the Consul addressed him officially on the subject, he would consider it.

Memorandum on Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’s telegram repeated in Government of India’s Telegram of 1st December 1910. 10 The immediate question out of which this arises is the desirability of concluding a treaty with a Sheikh or Sheikhs of the El Katr peninsula as a bulwark against Turkish aggression. In a Despatch of 22nd August 1910 His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had written: “ Should His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India now decide on the expediency of making such a treaty, there would seem to me no objection “ from the Constantinople point of view.” The Foreign Office referred to ;the India Office, the India Office to the Government of India, and the Government of India to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. It will be convenient to take Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’s telegram piece meal :— I. “ At the present juncture I find it difficult to discuss question apart from general Anglo-Turkish situation in the Gulf. In a letter just received Consul at Basrah writes that new Vali, when ashed what action he had taken regarding Zakhnuniyeh, replied that the island is Turkish territory and challenged right of Consul to discuss it officially or privately. He added that he was astonished that Consul did not mind his own business which was trade. It is thus evident that communications made to Porte regarding^ recent incidents have had no effect, and it seems to me that position has become impossible and humiliating, and that unless atmosphere is quickly cleared frequent recurrence of unpleasant incidents is inevitable. It appears to be generally agreed that temporising policy, which we have pursued for years past, will not serve the purpose with the Young Turk regime, and 1 submit that their assertive attitude and recent attempts to upset status quo give us strong and imperative grounds for settling issues nowP The general position is at present as follows. In their letter of 4th ■October last the Foreign Office requested the observations of Viscount Morley on the terms of a draft despatch which it was proposed to address to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, “respecting the vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey, and the number of “ incidents of political aggression which have recently marked^the conduct “ of the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf.” The draft despatch, after enumerating the complaints of His Majesty’s Government, ^concluded as follows :— “ These occurrences, which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced in their cumu lative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities,—an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. . ppg Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint; in ^taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty s Govern ment have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of course arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.” S. 41.Lord Morley concurred in the draft, remarking that he “ is in entire acord “ with Sir E. Grey in thinking that the time has come when it is necessary to “ give the Turkish Government a sharp reminder of the interests of Great “ Britain and India in those regions.” The despatch issued on 17th October 1910. Then came the anti-British and pro-German explosion at Constantinople caused by the publication of a garbled version of the British note to Persia regarding the restoration of order on the southern roads. The Ambassador took fright, and begged to be allowed to postpone communication of the despatch “ until ill-feeling has died down ” (Sir G. Lowther’s telegram Xo. 2A2 of 24th October); and the Foreign Office, without again consulting this Office, agreed (Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 323 of 26th October). Lord Morley thereupon addressed a letter (28th October)' to the Foreign Office, which was of the nature of a protest against this change of policy, observing that “ Sir G. Lowther’s telegram No. 232 of 24th October contains no “ considerations that could not have been foreseen when the despatch in “ question issued ” ; that the object of His Majesty’s Government is “less “ to secure an adjustment of the particular incidents, than to impress “ upon the Turkish Government, in a manner that shall preclude further “ misunderstanding, the importance which they attach to their interests “ in those regions, and their determination to see that they are respected ” ; and that the probability of attaining this object would be “ greatly “ diminished if the general protest is long deferred, and if His Majesty’s “ Ambassador proceeds by means of piece-meal representations in the “ meantime.” To this letter the Foreign Office have not thought it necessary to reply, and we are therefore entirely in the dark as to what their general policy is. II. “ From a local standpoint what is needed to clear the air is (1) that we should cease to make a secret of our Agreement with Koweit, and should inform Porte that we intend to make it effective. If we can simultaneously eliminate anomaly of Turkish flag at Koweit, I strongly recommend it.' The history of Turkish and British relations with Koweit will be found in pp. 155-160 of the Report and Proceedings of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Baghdad Railway, Southern Persia, and the Persian Gulf, dated 26th January 1909. We have two secret Agreements with the Sheikh. By the first, dated 23rd Jannary 1899, he binds “ himself his heirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Repre- “ sentative of any Power or Government, without the previous sanction of “ the British Government,” and “not to cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give “ for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory “ to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous “ consent of His Majesty’s Government for these purposes.” In return he is assured oi the “ good offices of the British Government ” towards himself, his heirs, and successors. The first of these conditions w r as inserted without the authority of His Majesty’s Government, and in approving it Lord G. Hamilton remarked that its “ operation, more especially with regard “ to the relations of the Sheikh to the Turkish Government, will require “ the careful attention of Your Excellency.” (Secret Despatch No 11 of 30th March 1899). By the second agreement, dated 15th October 1907, we secured (a) the lease of a strip of land on the foreshore to the mouth of Bunder Shweikh ; (h) the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of certain other tracts, including “ the entire island of Warba, situated near Khor Abdullah and the surrounding foreshore.” The Sheikh in the same agreement confirmed the earlier one, and expressly included the Ottoman Government among the foreign Governments to whom he is not to alienate Koweit territory. For obvious reasons secrecy was necessary, but the German Government were informed confidentially ol the second condition of the 1899 Agreement, and if they know of it the Turks certainly know of it also.It is not quite clear what Colonel Cox means by making the agreement “ effective.” It is ineffective only in the sense that the circumstances have never arisen in which it would take effect. Presumably he means a making explicit of what is implicit in it, viz., n denial of Turkish sovereignty and an assertion of a British protectorate. This would have to be considered with reference to its effect on Germany as well as on Turkey. As regards the later agreement, there is the further difficulty that the Sheikh’s claim to the island of Warba is not indisputable, and as recently as March last Government of India, India Office, and Foreign Office were all agreed that it was inadvisable to take any steps to raise the question (S. 3130/10). As regards the Turkish flag, it should be explained that the Sheikh of Koweit has flown it certainly since 1871, and possibly since 1856. In 1901, when it was suggested by the Government of India that he should discontinue the use of it, Lord Lansdowne rejected the proposal, and was “ not prepared to support any action which could be interpreted as asserting the entire indepen- “ dence of the Sheikh of Koweit ” (Foreign Office letter, 24th August 1901, S. 2251/01). The proposal was pressed later in the year, with the suggestion that the Sheikh should fly the plain red Arab flag instead, but the Foreign Office adhered to their objection (Foreign Office letter 24th September 1901, S. 2366/01). In 1904 the Government of India suggested that the Sheikh might retain the Turkish flag for use at Koweit and use a distinctive flag (i.e. a Turkish flag with the word “ Koweit ” written across it in Arabic) elsewhere (Secret letter No. 2247 of Sth December 1904), and this was agreed to by the Foreign Office (letter of 18th February 1905, S. 2653). The Sheikh concurred at first (S. 873/06), but later in the same year demurred, on the ground that it “ was sure to get him into trouble ” with the Turks, unless be was guaranteed by us against the consequences (S. 2010/06). The Government of India thought that this “might involve us in responsibilities of a somewhat extended character ” (Secret Letter No. 193 of 27th December 1906, S. 2205). The Foreign Office were consulted (27th January 1907), and the Ambassador at Constantinople was not opposed to according this guarantee, thinking it “ very unlikely ” that the Turkish Government would interfere with the Sheikh’s action (Sir N. O’Conor’s Despatch No. 105 of 18th February 1907); but the Foreign Office have never replied to our letter, and the question has remained in a state of suspended animation ever since. It will have been observed, from the passage referred to above in the Defence Committee’s proceedings, that the basis of our policy at Koweit has purported to be adherence to the status quo. This has been a convenient formula, but it is two-edged. The Turkish Government understand it in their own sense (and what that sense is is shown by the fact that they have made the Sheikh a Kaim-makam, and that they are applying the utmost pressure to induce him to register himself as a Turkish subject). We under stand it in our’s. One of the difficulties is to define our own meaning. Thus, the Foreign Office were parties to the agreement of 1899. Yet in September 1901 they declared that “ there does not appear to have been any “ period since [1871] when His Majesty’s Government have not been ready “ to admit at least the suzerainty, if not the actual sovereignty, of the Sultan.” {Foreign Office letter of 24th September 1901). For practical purposes the definition given by Sir T. Sanderson to Count Metternich a few days earlier seems sufficient, viz., that the status quo is “the Sultan’s authority as it exists in those parts.” Turkish authority “as it exists” is limited to the Turkish title conferred on the Sheikh (it may be noted that within the last few weeks the Sheikh has refused the offer of an allowance to accompany the title), the use by the Sheikh of the Turkish flag, and a Turkish guard sent to the island of Bubiyan, in violation of our definition of the status quo, in 1902. It would appear, therefore, that while there is nothing in the agreements that could not be made public without violating the status quo, we could not deny Turkish suzerainty if the Foreign Office view of 1901 is sound; nor could we assert a protectorate in view of Lord Lansdowne’s pledge to the Turkish Government in 1901 so long as the Turks themselves maintain the status quo (as we understand it), and do not send troops to Koweit. A further question is whether the despatch of the Turkish guard to Bubiyan Island does not absolve us from this pledge.So much for theory. In practice it will be observed that His Majesty’s Government have at times been inclined to go somewhat further. In January 1902 H.M.S. Pomone landed guns to protect the Sheikh against an attack threatene 1 by the Amir of Nejd and the Turks, and His Majesty’s Government, in spite of Turkish protests, refused to remove them so long as danger of attack existed. And in October 1902 His Majesty’s Government, while refusing to give the Sheikh guns for his own use, under took to defend the Koweit district (understanding thereby the district adjoining or close to the bay) provided that he fulfdled his engagements and took their advice. Our definition of the status quo seems therefore in practice to receive this extension, viz., that we should deny to the Turks the means of asserting even such authority as they may possess. (2.) “ That we should (a) bring about withdrawal of Turkish military posts from El Bidaa, Bubiyan, Urn Kasr, Zakhnuniyeh, and Jinnah, and (b) finally to abolish mudirates at Wakra, dec., and (c) induce Turks to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and UjairT (a) As Bubiyan, Um Kasr, and Jinnah stand on a rather different footing from the rest of the places mentioned, they may be taken first. Bubiyan is an island immediately to the north of Koweit, between Koweit bay and the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. It is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, mainly in virtue of the fact that some of his tribes (the Awazim) use it for fishing purposes. But in 1902 the Turks sent a small guard there, and the Ambassador at Constantinople was directed to protest. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he was not aware of the occupation of Bubiyan Island, though he knew that troops had been sent to Um Kasr; and he informed the Ambassador that the real motive of these proceedings was to keep a debouche for the Bagdad Railway under Turkish protection, as difficulties had been raised about extending it to Koweit (1912/02). In 1904 the Government of India recommended either that the Porte should be called upon to withdraw their post and that we should ourselves establish a post in behalf of the Sheikh at the northern end of the island, or that the Porte should be informed that we regard the island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that unless Turkish troops were withdrawn we should support him in establishing a post of his owm (402/04). Sir N. O’Conor was thereupon authorised to repeat his former protest, and, after an interval of some months, if the post had not been withdrawn, to inform the Porte in the sense of the Government of India’s second alternative (2G05/04). The first part of these instructions was carried out, and as regards the action subsequently to be taken the Government of India made the following recommendations in their telegram of 26th June 1905 :— “ Mubarak welcomes idea of establishing post, on condition ( 1 ) that British Government give him full moral support, inform Porte that they recognise his claim to Bubiyan, and support him in instituting post ; ( 2 ) Mubarak asks for following material support; (a) maintenance of Political Agent at Koweit as practically permanent; ( 6 ) occasional visit of man-of-war to Koweit and Khor Abdullah ; (c) contribution by British Government of Rs. 500 for erection of guard quarters, and Rs. 100 a month for guard maintenance. We regard these terms as fair, and advise full acceptance. Cost of (c) is less than subsidy sanctioned in your telegram of 17th January 1899. Sheikh suggests more than one post, and visit by Cox to Khor Abdullah should be sanctioned before number or location of posts is settled.” The Foreign Office thought that this went rather too far, and the question was held over for consideration by the Defence Committee in connection with that of the eventual terminus of the Bagdad Railway (3249/05). In September 1905 Sir N. O’Conor again spoke to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, but without drawing a reply. In August 1906 the Govern ment of India returned to the charge (1372/06), and the wffiole question (which does not seem to have been considered by the Defence Committee) was referred to an inter-departmental committee (Foreign Office, Admiralty, and India Office), which, in its report dated 2nd October 1907, recom mended that “ if diplomatic considerations permit . . . the continued “ occupation of Bubiyan Island by a Turkish post, in derogation of the A Sheikh’s territorial claims (which have been recognised and supported byHis Majesty’s Government), should be neutralised by the establishment forthwith of a Koweiti post, with the countenance of His Majesty’s Govern- ment, on Warba Island (immediately north of Bubiyan), or, if that should “ prove undesirable, on the northern shores of Bubiyan Island. If practi- “ cable we would even recommend the establishment of posts on both islands. “We desire to emphasise the importance which we attach to the effective “ assertion of the Sheikh’s territorial claims to Bubiyan.” The Foreign Office accepted these conclusions (12th November 1907, 3903/07), and local enquiries were instituted as to the basis of the Sheikh’s claims to Warba. It appeared that these w r ere not very strong, historically; but in view of the fact that it is separated only by a narrow channel from Bubiyan, it might fairly be argued on geographical grounds that the ownership of Warba followed from that of Bubiyan. The Government of India reported in September 1908 that the Sheikh was not at the time anxious to move in the matter of his claims to the latter, and His Majesty’s Government therefore decided to take no action (Secret Despatch No. 19, 30th October 1908), a decision which, as has already been mentioned, was reaffirmed in April last (Secret Despatch No. 9, 8 th April 1910). To Um Kasr the Sheikh’s claim appears to be much more shadowy than to Bubiyan. There is an old fort there, which is said to have been built by his grandfather, but in 1904 it was uninhabited. On the other hand the Turks were reported to have little claim beyond that of actual occupation. • • The importance of these places is indicated by the following passage from the Government of India’s letter of 4th February 1904: “ With the “ shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a single “ Power, the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any “ time be converted into an impregnable harbour.” Jinnah has not hitherto figured in the correspondence, but it is an island lying alongside of the Island of Musallamiya, which is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. The Sheikh protested against the landing of Turkish troops on the latter island in 1902. It may be explained that the southern limits of his territory have never been defined, but the Government of India were of opinion that the Sheikh’s claim to Musallamiya could not be maintained, and that the island was clearly within the Turkish sphere of influence. (Telegram 10th May 1902.) Of the other places mentioned as occupied by Turkish troops, El Bidaa and Zakhnuniyeh are south of the region known as El Katif, in which His Majesty’s Government have recognised continuous Turkish influence. As will have been seen from paragraph 155 of the Defence Com mittee’s Proceedings, the southernmost point of that influence is Ujair. South of Ujair and on the El Katr Peninsula, His Majesty’s Government have declined to recognise Turkish sovereignty, but the Turks established a garrison at El Bidaa in 1872 and we have acquiesced in it. Zakhnuniyeh is 10 miles south of Ujair, and is claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Turks ran up their flag there in March 1909 and arranged to keep a guard there. The Government of India recommended that a protest should be made at Constantinople, and that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be allowed to fly his flag on the island (telegram of 23rd May 1909). The protest was made and the Ambassador was informed in September that the guard had been withdrawn at the beginning of June. In these circumstances it was decided to drop the question of the Bahrein flag, the policy of His Majesty’s Government being to avoid disturbance of the status quo (telegram to Viceroy 13th October 1909). In November the Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that there were no Turkish soldiers on the island, but by April 1910 they had reappeared, and the Turkish flag was again being flown. The Ambassador again protested, but received only evasive replies (telegram of 16th August 1910). The subject was therefore included in Sir E. Grey’s despatch of 17th October, to which reference has already been made, and the Ambassador was instructed “ to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison.” In a telegram dated 17th October 1910 Sir G. Lowther reported that the Porte had instructed the Vali of Basra that when the gendarmes left the island at the end of the fishing season they were not to return except under orders from Constanti nople ; and on 14th November he reported that the gendarmes had deserted,/O 6 Z l 'T je T.

If the Minister for Foreign Affairs, after studying the question of Zakhnuniyeh and Odied and consulting his colleagues, does not give categorical instructions for the non-interference of the Turkish local authorities, it would seem necessary, subject to the views of His Majesty’s Government, to take a strong fine. For, to the Turkish mind, Zakhnuniyeh is a sort of stepping stone to El Katr, and perhaps even to the Trucial coast. The Turks do not put forward any valid claims to justify their territorial acquisitions in those parts, but it is not difficult to glean that they base their claims on the fact that in the beginning of the 16th century a Turkish flotilla, under Piale Pasha, annexed Gwadur, in South Baluchistan, and sailed up the Gulf, compelling the Arab Chiefs to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan and Caliph. They further feel that as the dominant Islamic power they have undefined right to bring under their allegiance and to protect the small Arab Moslem tribes, &amp;c., in the Arabian peninsula. Sir E. Grey’s despatch of 17th October contained the following passage :— ‘ I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government; I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well-nigh a century. “ Moreover, as Your Excellency is aware, in November and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacv over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. “ But, apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. “ In these circumstances Your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo; and your repre sentations were to be based, not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction.” III. “ That having achieved second item, we should make treaties on lines of Trucial Coast agreements with Bin Thani, and, if necessary, with other headmen on the west coast of KatrT The question of making an agreement was first raised by the Govern ment of India in 1902 in connection with the desire of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani to be taken under our protection, being alarmed at an intimation which he had received from the Turkish authorities that they intended to send more troops to those regions. The Government of India were in favour of the conclusion of an agreement, but in 1903 the idea was shelved because the abandonment by the Turks of the contemplated mudirates above referred to made it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to do anything themselves inconsistent with the status quo. The Government of India, however, in 1904 suggested that without establishing a protectorate it might be justifiable to make such an agreement with the Sheikh as would secure the maintenance of the status quo and the exclusion of foreign interference, the Sheikh undertaking not to enter into relations with, receive the representative of, or cede territory to any foreign power. (Secret letter No 77 of 31st March 1904). His Majesty’s Government had at the time a large number of questions outstanding with the Turkish Govern ment, and Sir N. O’Conor was unwilling to add to them, being moreoverdoubtful whether even the modified proposals of the Government of India could be squared with the status quo. As a compromise the Government of India proposed the revival of an agreement of 1868 made with a former bhmkh but the foreign Office (18th February 1905), thought that this would be ineffective, and the matter was reserved for consideration by the Defence Committee along with the whole question of the Persian Gulf. It is not known whether it was so considered, and it has not been heard of since until oir G. Lowther s Despatch of 22nd August, from which quotation has already been made, and the Foreign Office letter of 4th October, in which the views of the India Office were asked for. Cl e have in the present telegram the views of Lieutenant-Colonel Cox and the Government of India. They are as follows :— (Colonel Cox):— “ 1 consider that it would be useless now to make treaty with Bin Thani rndess we are prepared to do so openly, and to bring about elimination of lurkish influence of Katr, as suggested in second item above Without such simultaneous action existence of treaty would only be source of danger to the Thani family from, the present Turkish regime and they would themselves fight shy of it. (Government of India) :— “ We concur with Cox that no advantage would accrue from treaties with Aalr Chiefs, and furthe that Chiefs would probably not now agree to enter into treaties, unless the Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and UjairT It will be observed that in 1904, when the local situation was ripe Constantinople was not ready; and that now, when Constantinople is ready' the local situation is not ripe. Sir G. Lowther in his despatch of 22nd August savs that “the time may not be far distant when, as advocated by Lord i, -^ ans downe m February 1905, a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal treatment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf may “ become imperative.” The nearest approach that has been m'ade to anything comprehensive was Sir E. Grey’s Despatch of 17th October the late ot which has been described. If the settlement is to be friendly there must be some give and take. As to this Colonel Cox’s view is U hcther achievement of above ends is possible by means of comprehensive reciprocal compromise, or whether coercive measures will be necessary is a question beyond my purview, but I beg to say that I can conceive no quid pro quo which we could offer Porte in this sphere in exchanae for withdrawal of her pretensions. It could perhaps be found in some other sphereT This will presumably be accepted. The only points of contact that we have with Turkey in the neighbourhood of the Gulf are things that both of us want and neither can afford to part with. “ Should coercive measures (Colonel Cox says) be necessary, we can never expect the recurrence of such a favourable junction locally as exists at present The numerical strength of military posts in question has just been reduced to a minimum under Nazim Pasha’s scheme for concen- trahng troops at Bagdad; while we have strong squadron in the Persian Gulf in connection with Arms Traffic, which would make naval demonstration simple matter.” 4he Foreign Office, as has been mentioned above, have already contem plated resort to force in the case of the mudirates in Katr, with the result not uncommon m such cases—that it was proposed that India should perform the task. If troops are to be employed, it is perhaps natural that thev should be Indian troops But their employment would probably come within the scope of 21 &amp; 22 Viet. c. 106, s 55 : “ Except for preventing or repelling actaal invasion of Her Majesty’s Indian possessions, or under other sudden « T neces 5 lt y’ the revenues of India shall not, without the consent of both Houses of larhament, be applicable to defray the expenses of any „ military operation carried on beyond the external frontiers of such possessions by Her Majesty’s forces charged upon such revenues.” It istrue that the employment of Indian troops in the naval blockade has not been regarded as covered by the Act. But that can hardly be described as a military operation, whereas the ejection of Turkish garrisons could hardly be described otherwise. That, however, is perhaps ■a detail, since Parliamentary discussion might be inevitable in any case. As regard;* the local situation, Colonel Cox’s views are borne out by recent reports. The Consul-General at Bagdad has more than once called attention to the military weakness of the Province. In the August Summary (page 14) he noted that after denuding a large part of the country of troops Nazim Pasha had only been able to concentrate some 3,000 men at Bagdad, a number not more than a sufficient garrison for the capital. In order to effect this concentration the forces in Hasa have lately been considerably reduced ; in July 570 men were withdrawn (140 from El Bidaa), and 200 more were to follow. These were not to be replaced, but in cases of emergency troops would be sent from Basra (letter from Political Agent, Bahrein, 24th July 1910, S. 1317/10), the garrison of which the Consul-General, Bagdad, put at one battalion (September Summary, page 5). There remained 70 infantry (to be raised to 100 probably), 40 police, and 6 guns at Katif; 60 infantry and 4 guns at El Bidaa ; 50 infantry and 2 guns at Ujair; and about 600 infantry, 35 cavalry, 130 police, and 12 guns at Hofuf (the capital of Hasa, 40 miles inland from Ujair). It remains to consider the question of a treaty with the Katr Sheikh on its merits. Arguments in favour of it are given on page 4 of Sir R. Ritchie’s B !&amp;J memorandum of 30th January 1905. Since that date the case for a treaty v has become somewhat stronger. For example, the Katr peninsula is the only part of the coast of the Persian Gulf on which the arms traffic is not pro hibited, and it tends to be a dumping ground in consequence ; thus we heard on 5th December that a dhow under French colours had left Muscat in that direction. If we had a treaty our chain of defences would be complete. Again, with regard to the pearl fisheries, the Law Officers in answering the reference made to them had no doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as may justly be considered territorial. Outside these they were inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof ; but they considered that the point was not free from doubt. And as regards the deeper waters they were of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. In these circumstances, the Secretary of State agreed with the general conclusion of the Law Officers, viz., that it was not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalties from fishing on the banks. And he added, “The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods.” (Secret Despatch No. 8, of 31st March 1905.) These indirect methods, which would consist mainly in putting difficulties in the way of interlopers, could probably only be successfully employed if our position vis-a-vis of the tribes were such as would be secured to us by the proposed treaties. With regard to the terms of such treaties, it has been suggested that they should follow the lines of the 1892 agreements with the Trucial Chiefs. These provide (1) that the Chiefs will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Government; (2) that without the assent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence within their territory of the Agent of any other Government; j(3) that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territory, save to the British Government. CONCLUSIONS. “ Achievement of above measures would completely consolidate our position on Arab coast and in Gidf generally, especially in regard to pearl fishery question, and, if it is ever to be brought about, it seems essential that action should be taken now. If it is delayed, the suggested association of Turkey with Triple Alliance and increase10 0 / her navy may render task very difficult, if not impossible. In any case, therefore, by one method or another, I respectfully urqe necessity of adjusting position with Turkey forthwith, chronic elements of friction ichidi have now become dangevous.” follows • C0nClllS10I1S t0 theSe cons iderations seem to point are as (1.) It is desirable to conclude treaties with the Katr tribes. (L.) It is not possible to do so unless we can guarantee them against Turkish aggression. (3.) There seem to be three ways of arriving at such a guarantee— (а) A comprehensive settlement by friendly agreement. The materials for this do not appear to be forthcoming. (б) A comprehensive settlement by announcement to the Turks that we do not recognise their position at Koweit and south of bjair, and the translation of that announcement into action by the removal of all signs of Turkish authority. This would obviously be a serious measure, but it might perhaps be taken m reply to some particularly objectionable action on tie pait of the lurks, either in the Gulf or elsewhere, such as will doubtless be forthcoming before long. (c) A piecemeal settlement. We should make no announcement o policy , but as each case arises, instead of protestino - remove the objectionable Turks. In the case of Koweit tins would also, presumably, mean that we should support Jr 16 . by force in the question of the registration of his lurkish properties, i.e., guarantee him against the conse quences of forcibly ejecting any persons whom the Turks might send to take possession of those properties. (4.) When the T.irtish difficulty has been finally removed by one or other of these means, the main reason for concluding the agreements will have disappeared. F. A. H.British Interests on the Coast of Arabia, Koweit, Bahrein, and El Katr. The following extract from a letter of the 5th January 1903, from the Government of India to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, gives a succinct statement of the political geography of the Arabian coast of the Persian ‘Gulf. The places named are marked in the attached copy of Cuvzon’s map. “ From Kow T eit to Katif town Ottoman rule has long been recognised, and, in fact, though this has never been explicitly admitted, it would he difficult to dispute Turkish claims to exercise jurisdiction as far as, and inclusive of, Ojair. South of this place, and on the El Katr peninsula, His Majesty’s Gevernment have declined to recognise Turkish sovereignty, though the Turks actually have a garrison at El Bidan “ From and inclusive of Odeid eastward, the coast belongs to the Trucial Chiefs as far as Ras-el-Kheima. Thence, starting from Bams south of Tibba, round the Musandim promontory, to Dibba, the country is in the occupation of the Shihooh tribe. Claims have been put forward by the Sultan of Muscat to exercise jurisdiction over this tract, but it has been held that his ascendancy is so indeterminate that it need not be considered. From Dibba southward to Khor Kalba, the Batineh coast is regarded as part of the territory of the Sheikh of Shargah. The local Sheikhs have from time to time invoked the assistance of the Sultan of Muscat, but the Government of India have decided that no interference by Muscat can be admitted; that this portion of the coast is subject to the maritime truce; and that the Sheikh in power is bound by the terms of the agreements which have from time to time been concluded with the Trucial Chiefs.” The British Government has treaties with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, and with the Trucial Chiefs mentioned in the Government of India’s letter quoted above. The Koweit Treaty (23rd January 1899) provides that the Sheikh shall not receive the Agent or representative of any Foreign Power without the consent of the British Government, and shall not sell, lease, mortgage, or give for occupation any portion of his territory to any Foreign Power or the subject of any Foreign Power. Simultaneously with the signing of the Treaty, the Resident wrote to the Sheikh promising him the good offices of the British Government, and impressing on him as a condition of the Agree ment that it should be kept secret and not divulged without our consent. The Treaty was accompanied with a gift of Rs. 15,000. The treaties with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs are on the same lines ; but provide not only that the Chief shall receive no representative of any Foreign Power, but that he shall not enter into any agreement or hold any correspondence with any Foreign Power. And, as regards the cession of territory, these treaties provide that the Chief will not sell, lease, &amp;c., any territory , except to the British Government. These treaties contain no promise of protection or good offices. It may be added that we have a treaty with Muscat (of 1891) by which the Sultan agrees not to cede, sell, mortgage. &amp;c., any portion of his * territory save to the British Government, and that along the southern coast of Arabia, west of Dhofar, where Muscat territory ends, we have agreements with the Sheikhs, along the coast as far as Aden and the Red Sea, binding them not to hold correspondence or enter into agreements with loicign Powers. This stipulation in the majority of cases is accompanied by one precluding the Chief from parting with territory. Koweit. Koweit has no immediate and direct relation with the question of the policy to be pursued on the coast south of Ojair where lurkish so\ereignty S. S. 4.2 is held to end, except in so far as our proceedings at Koweit influence the attitude of the Turks towards us in El Katr and Bahrein. The questions at issue at present with the Turks at Koweit are : — -iniV ^he status of our Political Agent. —Major Knox was sent in August 1904 to Koweit m connection with the difficulties arising from Turkish complaints that the Sheikh was supporting Ibn Snoud (the Wahabi) who had defeated Ibn Eashid (the Turkish protege) in Nejd, and whose successes seem suffident to threaten the continuance of Turkish rule in the interior, the Turks, who apparently believe that we are instigating the Sheikh of Koweit to support Ibn Saoud, at once complained of Major Knox’s appoint ment. We replied that the appointment was not a permanent one but that we reserved the right of sending an officer to Koweit at our “ uncon- troUed discretion ” to report and “ensure the continuance of the modus mvendi which had been arrived at. We also instructed the Government ol India (26th November 1904) that Major Knox might remain at Koweit lor the present, that he was to he withdrawn after a “ reasonable interval,” and that before leaving he was to inform the Sheikh that he would repeat his visits, and that the date of his return would depend on the course of events. The present position is governed by these instructions. It should be added that the Resident recently reported that the Sheikh of Koweit was going with Ibn Saoud to Basra to come to terms with the Turks. Other reports however, say that the Turks are organising a military expedition on a large scale to put down Ibn Saoud and the Wahabi movement. Major Knox’s instructions are that he is not to say or do anything to connect us even in directly with the warfare now in progress in the interior, and that he is to repeat to the Sheikh the warning to avoid entanglements in the interior given him by Lord Curzon personally when he visited Koweit. (2.) Bulnan Island.—The island is apparently a desolate mud-flat, where Kovv&lt; it fishermen have certain rights. It is of importance as commanding one bank of the Khor Abdullah, which will presumably be the channel of •approach to the harbour at the terminus of the Baghdad Railway. In 1902 Sir JV. O Conor protested against the action of the Turks in placing a military ™ ( .?L SOm , e 10 meD ’ relleved ^ intervals from Eao) on the island In May i904 Sir N. O’Conor reverted to the subject, saying that unless the post was withdrawn, it would be necessary to ra : se the question “ in a more unpleasant The action to be taken, in event of a Turkish failure to vo untarily withdraw this post, has been reserved for consideration. The proposal of the Government of India was either to insist on Turkish with drawal or to allow the Sheikh to establish a post of his own. Bahrein. Our relations with Bahrein are governed by the treaty already mentioned. b he ‘ sl i a ' ld « situated in a deep bay ; it faces on the west the Turkish district ot Katif, and on the east, the peninsula of El Katr, in which we do not recognise lurkish authority, 'the place is of importance as the centre of BHhTI r T1 ° f tt l e Gulf ' U is ‘• ,lso tbe -e^ence of a number of Butisb Indian traders, whose export trade in dates from Katif has recently f ^ some difficulty with the Turkish Government owing to the extortion's or the local Turkish authorities. We do not recognise Turkish authoiity in Bahrein. In 1895 we forcibly dispersed, m the interests of the Bahrein Sheikh, a settlement of malcontents who had established themselves at Zobara, on the Katr coast, under the uikishflag. the Turks protested, but His Majesty’s Government stated m reply that they did not recognise Turkish jurisdiction on the Katr coast and must repeat once more that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which is under Bie protection of the Queen of England, are totally inadmissible ” (Note Verbale of 12th August 1895.) ^ 1 U1 slol e- In 1901 Sir N. O’Conor, reporting on the action of the Government of India in recognising the Sheikh’s eldest son as his successor, said that any arrangement which strengthened our authority over Bahrein must be regarded uitli satisfaction, and added that he would welcome the news that a British oi British Indian subject had been appointed Director of the Bahrein Customs as a material proot ot our authority over the island. Sir N. O’Conor further3 pointed out that the Porte, if they thought they could count upon the support of any Foreign Power in asserting then* supremacy over the island, would not lose the opportunity of doing so. In this connection it should be mentioned that an inquiry was received from the French Government in ,July last as to bringing Bahrein within the jurisdiction of their Vice- Consulate at Bushire, the reason given being that French subjects have come to establish themselves on the island and carry on pearl fishing. The Government of India were in favour of postponing the reply to the French- request, and this view, as far as this Office is aware, has been accepted by the Foreign Office. In August 1904 the Government of India were authorised, with a view to strengthening our position with the Sheikh, to appoint an officer of the Itegular lolitical Service as Resident, in place of the existing Agent who was of a lower official status. A small guard of Native Infantry was also sanctioned, and it was arranged that a suitable vessel should be placed at the disposal ol the Political Officer to be used if necessary in the suppression of piracy in the shallower waters of the coast. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, replied that he had felt strongly for some years past, that we were losing the opportunity of asserting our supremacy in Bahrein, that he sincerely welcomed the proposals of the Government of India, and that he undertook that the Turkish Government should raise no serious difficulties. The above statement may perhaps suffice to explain the position of Bahrein in connection with the present question of the action to be taken in consequence of the outrages committed by retainers of the Sheikh’s nephew on certain German and Persian subjects. The German case has already been met by the punishment of the offenders and the payment of compen sation. In the Persian case the Sheikh seems recalcitrant. There seems no objection to the proposals made by the Government of India with a view to obtain redress and to ensure order in the future, except as regards the recommendation that we should seize the Custom House and not give it up till the Sheikh accepts British management of his Customs. At present the Customs are farmed to British Indian banias, with the result that the Chief only receives a revenue of rather more than a lakh, which is a third only of the estimated yield of an efficient system. In their Despatch of 21st April 1904, the Government of India explained that the Sheikh had on several occasions promised not to renew his leases to the farmers when they fell in, but that he had tailed to keep his word when the time came; and they said that they regarded the question of Customs reform as a test case of the nature and degree of the influence which the British Government may reasonably claim to exercise over the Sheikh. A compromise would be to insist on the Sheikh cancelling the leases (with compensation to the farmers), and assuming the administration himself. This would assimilate the Bahrein practice to that of Muscat, where the Sultan has abolished the farming system, but has consistently refused to put the administration under British control, retaining the management in his own hands. The adoption of this change by the Sheikh of Bahrein might or might not lead to Ids agreeing subsequently to placing the administration under a British official. El Katr. The notification to the Porte of 12th August 1895 (mentioned above) sufficiently establishes the fact that His Majesty’s Government do not recognise Turkish jurisdiction over the Katr coast. But the force of the statement is somewhat modified by the fact that since 1872 there has been a Turkish gamson at El Bidaa. In lb68 we concluded an agreement with the then Sheikh (the father of the present Sheikh), by which he bound himself to take no hostile action by sea, and to refer all disputes to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sheikh Jasim, the present Sheikh, on succeeding his father, applied for a renewal of the Agreement, but this was refused (in 1882) on the ground of the nature of his relations with the Turks. Sheikh Jasim is now of a very great age, and the virtual ruler is his brother, Sheikh Ahmed, with whom the Government of India are exceedinglyv 4 desirous that a treaty should be made in anticipation of the death of Sheikh Jasim. An opportunity of making such a treaty arose last year, when the Turks disturbed the status quo by appointing officials to various places on the coast, and when the Government of India proposed that a treaty should be entered into with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of our treaties with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, by which he would be debarred from dealings with Foreign Powers, and from parting with territory to others than the British Government. The Turks, however, withdrew their interloping officials in deference to our remonstrances; and the Government of India were instructed to report whether the objects to be gained by a treaty Avere of such urgent importance as to justify immediate action in spite of the diffi culties Avhich such action would create witli the Turks. The Government of India replied, in their telegram of the 30th December, by proposing the immediate conclusion with Sheikh Ahmed of a treaty similar to that of 1868, which Avould bind him to take no hostile action by sea, and to refer all disputes to the Besident in the Persian Gulf. The reasons in favour of the immediate conclusion of a treaty are—- (1.) The Katr coast, lying as it does between Bahrein and the Pirate coast, constitutes a break in the continuity of our maritime influence. (2.) The absence of a treaty may hinder His Majesty’s ships in the work of suppressing piracy and maintaining the peace of the Gulf. In this connection it may be observed that the objection to the extension of Turkish authority in those regions is that the Turks cannot establisli a strong administration, and 1 that their attempt to rule El Katr might only end in anarchy. Bahrein, as the centre of the pearl fisheries, attracts pirates. '(3.) The absence of a treaty considerably increases the difficulty of making arrangements to protect the pearl fisheries from outside interference which has been threatened by certain Frenchmen settled in Bahrein. The question of what powers Ave possess in this respect under our existing treaties Avith the local Sheikhs is under the consideration of the Law Officers of the CroAvn. (4.)' The absence of a treaty may encourage the Turks to set up a riA'at Sheikh to Sheikh Ahmed on the death of Sheikh Jasim. In this connection it may be observed that Sheikh Ahmed and the Arabs of El Katr are Wahabis, and presumably sympathise Avith Ibn Saoud in his attack on Turkish authority in the interior. It is thus of importance to them that the new Sheikh should be on their side against Ibn Saoud. From tbe point of view of the Government of India, the balance of advantage seems to lie on the side of a treaty with Sheikh Ahmed; and it has been suggested that, as any treaty with him Avill raise a difficulty Avith the Turks, if there is to be a treaty, it should be on the lines of those with the Trucial Chiefs. On the other hand, if Ave make a treaty it will be incumbent on us to support Sheikh Ahmed if, on the death of Sheikh Jasim, he becomes embroiled with the Turks, and a fresh chapter of difficulties with the Porte may be opened. To leave the situation in El Katr to work itself out Avithout interference on our part, even though the ultimate result may be the restoration of a nominal Turkish sovereignty, would not be inconsistent with the policy laid down in Lord Lansdowne’s Minute of 21st March 19D2, as to the position at Koweit. Lord Lansdowne stated that the “ bed rock ” of our policy in the Gulf is that “ Avhile AA r e do not grudge a debouche for “ international commerce in the Gulf, and have no wish to make it into a British lake, we should resist to the utmost all attempts by other PoAvers “ to obtain a foothold on its shores for naval or military purposes .... i( shall pursue that policy not in virtue of ambiguous understandings Avith local Chiefs, but as the predominant Power in Southern Persia and “ the Persian Gulf.” 30th January 1905. B. Bitchie.r rom Vice) 1st December 1910. foreign Secret. K] Katr. \\ e have consulted Cox on question raised in your telegram of 6th October, lie replies as follows : “At the present juncture I find it difficult to discuss question apart from general Anglo-Turkish situation in the Gulf. “In a letter just received, Consul at Basrah writes that new Vali, when asked what action he had taken regarding Zakhnumyeh, replied that the island is Turkish territory, and challenged right of Consul to discuss it officially or privately. He added that he was astonished that Consul did not mind his own business which was trade. It is thus evident that communi cations made to Porte regarding recent incidents have had no effect, and it seems to me that position has become impossible and humdiating, and that unless atmosphere is quickly cleared frequent recurrence of unpleasant incidents ip inevitable, ft appears to be generally agreed that temporising policy, which we have pursued for years past, will not serve the purpose with the young lurk regime, and I submit that their assertive attitude and recent attempts to upset stains quo gives us strong and imperative grounds for settling issues now. “ I-rom a local standpoint what is needed to clear the air is— 1st. lhat we should cease to make a secret of our agreement with Ivoweit, and should inform Porte that we intend to make it effective. II we can simultaneously eliminate anomaly of Turkish flag at Koweit, I strongly recommend it. “2nd. That we should bring about withdrawal of Turkish military posts from Albida, Bubiyan, [Jmmkasr, Zakhnuniyeh, and Jinnah, and finally abolish Mudirates at Wakra,&amp;c., and induce Turks to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and Ojair. • &gt;rd. 1 hat having achieved second item, we should make treaties on lines ol trucial coast agreement with Bin Thani, and, if necessary, with other headmen on the west coast of Katar. “ Whether achievement of above ends is possible by means of compre hensive reciprocal compromise or whether coercive measures null be necessary is a question beyond my purview, but I beg to say that I can conceive no quid pro quo which we could offer Porte in this sphere in exchange for withdrawal of her pretensions. It could, perhaps, be found in some other sphere. “ Should coercive measures be necessary, we can never expect the recur rence of such a favourable juncture locally as exists at present. The numerical strength of military posts in question has just been reduced to minimum under Nazim Pasha’s scheme for concentrating troops at Bagdad; while we have strong squadron in Persian Gulf in connection with arms traffic which would make naval demonstration simple matter. “Achievement of above measures would completely consolidate our position on Arab coast and in Gulf generally, especially in regard to pearl fishery question, and, if it is ever to be brought about, it seems essential that action should be taken now. If it is delayed, the suggested association of Turkey with Triple Alliance and increase of her navy may render task very difficult, if not impossible. In any case, therefore, by one. method or another, I respectfully urge necessity of adjusting position with Turkey forthwith and eliminating chronic elements of friction which have now become dangerous. On grounds above explained, I consider that it would be useless now to make treaty with Bin Thani, unless we are prepared to do so openly and to bring about elimination of 'Turkish influence from Katr, as suggested in second item above. Without such simultaneous action, existence of treaty would only be a source of danger to the Thani family from the present Turkish regime, and that they would themselves fmht shv of it.” We concur with Cox that no advantage would accrue from treaties with Katr Chiefs, and further that Chiefs would probably not now agree to enter into treaties, unless the Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and Ojair.Sir:- I aai diracted by the Secretary of State for for eign Affairs to transmit to you for submission to the Karl of Crewe copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires at Constantinople regarding British interests in Mesopotamia. Mr. Marling reports further aggressive action by the Turkish local authorities of Bagdad and states that according to information receiv ed from His Majesty's Consul-General in that city Bri- 11 sri prestige has thereby been dariaged to such an ex tent that some British Indian Subjects have taken steps to have themselves naturalized as Ottoman subjects, while others have declared their intention of doing so . To restore British prestige in some measure Mr. Marling suggests that His Majesty's Ship 'Redbreast' should be Instructed to visit Zakhm^lyeh to ascertain whether any Turkish gendarmes are still on the island and to create an impression on the local Arab population.

Section i. [43062] No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 28.) ^ Pera, November 23, 1910. WITH reference to your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October and Sir Gerard Lowther’s despatch No. 797 of the 31st October concerning the arbitrary and aggressive proceedings of the Ottoman local authorities in Bagdad and Bussorah, I have the honour to enclose paraphrases of two telegrams from His Majesty’s consul at Bagdad, reporting that the property numbered No. 6 in his despatch No. 42 of the 5th September has been demolished under circumstances of injury and insult, that the authorities had given notice of their intention to expropriate part of Messrs. Lynch’s head offices at a price little more than a third of that estimated by their local manager, that it is rumoured locally that the temporary permission to tow barges given in 1899 is about to be withdrawn, and that the general effect produced on British subjects was so deplorable that some of them—presumably Indian Moslems—were actually becoming Ottoman subjects mainly owing to the apparent inability of the British authorities to afford them proper protection. . . Mr. Lorimer also expresses the opinion that the Bagdad municipal loan should not be entrusted to the present local Government, or in any case should not be given until the question of compensation to British subjects has been settled. I have further just received a written unofficial communication from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, complaining that Lynch’s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad or Bussorah. As regards the demolitions, Sir Gerard Lowther in his telegram No. 246 ot the 11th instant reported to you that the Minister of the Interior had practically decided to indemnify the owners for their losses, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave me a similar assurance again yesterday morning. The Minister of the Interior has, moreover, declared that the Government has decided to pay such indemnities should it be proved that the regulations on the subject have been contravened.” In reply to the remark that after the buildings were removed it was difficult to prove that they were not in a dangerous state before demolition, he replied that there had also been numerous strong complaints from natives whose property had been similarly treated, that the matter might come up in Parliament, that one of the Bagdad committee deputies had received secret instructions to investigate the^ whole affair, that his conclusions seemed most damaging to the vah, that both native and foreign subjects would have to be indemnified, and that all his (the Minister’s) colleagues were in favour of recalling Nazim Pasha. . ...... . . General Nazim Pasha has the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian, and is rather the type of a blunt soldier who is ignorant, as his recent methods at Bagdad have shown, of the niceties of civil administration. As you are awaie, he has been^ an opponent of the committee, and early in 1909 was suddenly appointed Minister of War by Kiamil Pasha, with the idea of compelling the officers to cease dabbling in politics. This excited the fierce anger of the committee, who promptly brought about the violent and unconstitutional fall of the Grand Vizier and his new W ar Minister. Again, after the mutiny of the 13th April, 1909, Nazim Pasha incurred the displeasure of the'committee by accepting the post of commander of the mutinous Constantinople army corps, which he reduced to order, and advocated punishing without the intei \en- tion of the Macedonian forces. Being popular with the rank and file his presence in the capital was irksome to the committee, who apparently resolved to send him to the distant post of Bagdad, with the ulterior object of ruining his reputation and dismissing him as a failure. It is not impossible that Nazim Pasha’s arbitrary methods of improving Bagdad were indirectly suggested to him by some member of the committee with a view to compassing his- downfall, and it seems undoubted that they would like to be able to say that his recall was due to the English, to whom Nazim was reputed to be friendly. It is on this account that in our written and verbal complaints about the recent high-handed proceedings at Bagdad this embassy has been caieful to omit any mention of his name, and to refer always to “ the local authorities” or “ the Bagdad 1! • 1 C0P m ' 10municipality.’’ There seems little douht now that Nazim Pasha’s tenure of office a Bagdad will not last long. With reference to Mr. Lorimer’s suggestion that steps might be taken to defer the conclusion of the Bagdad municipal loan, I do not see how, in view of recent events, the embassy could approach the National Bank with that object. As regards the expropriation of Messrs. Lynch’s head offices, I have caused the Minister of the Interior to telegraph to the vali to see that the provisions of the Expropriation Law are not departed from, and informed Mr. Lorimer that, unless the authorities offer a reasonable price, Messrs. Lynch’s agent should, if necessary, bring an action within fifteen days, as prescribed. I have further had the Minister of the Interior’s attention drawn to the threatened withdrawal of Messrs. Lynch’s permission to tow barges, and to the fact that the existing accumulation of cargo at Bussorah makes it very inopportune to raise the question at the present moment. In view of the present frame of mind of the Turkish authorities, they would not now be likely to entertain the suggestion in Messrs. Lynch’s letter of the 21st October and that of the 10th November, 1910, enclosed in your despatches Nos. 335 and 346 of the 31st October and the 15th November respectively, that they should be allowed to use a fourth steamer to help to work off the congestion at Bussorah. In the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company’s letter of the 10th November it is stated that Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery has been granted a permit to run steamers between Bagdad and Bussorah, and that this gentleman is understood to be in close touch with the agents of the German Hamburg-Amerika line. At first sight it is difficult to see why Messrs. Lynch’s agent at Bagdad should not be in as close if not closer touch with Mr. Abdul Kader-el-Khedery. The communication from the Porte complaining that Messrs. Lynch’s steamers fly the British flag when moored at Bagdad and Bussorah seemed to contest the right of the original two steamers to carry the British flag. I at once caused energetic representations to be made on the subject, with the result that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs now declares that probably the local authorities confounded the two original steamers with the third steamer, for which permission was granted in January 1907, with the proviso that it should fly the Ottoman flag, and that their complaints refer only to alleged “ irregularities ” of the third steamer. As regards the decision prohibiting the registration of Sheikh Kazal’s lands at Failieh, the Porte has hinted that representations on the subject would more properly come from the Persian Embassy here, but has promised to re-examine the matter. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to try and arrange that the sheikh’s agent should move the new vali at Bussorah to again refer the matter to Constantinople for reconsideration. In a telegram of the 14th November, His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah reported from Bush ire that the “ Bedbreast ” had visited Wakra and Odeid and found no sign of Turkish mudirs at those places, while, as reported in my telegram No. 248 of the 14th instant, His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire has since reported the desertion of the Turkish post at Zakhnuniyeh. I would venture to suggest, for your consideration, the advisability of sending the “ Redbreast” to Zakhnuniyeh to ascertain whether any Turkish gendarmes are still there, and whether, as previously reported, the Turk ish flag is still at the bottom of the mast. The visit of a British ship is certain to be reported, and its importance magnitied by the local Arabs up to Bussorah and Bagdad, and its effect may counteract to a certain extent the deplorable impression among British subjects at Bagdad caused by the high-handed action of the Turkish local authorities. The fact that this despatch is a report on some of the questions forming the subject of your despatch No. 312 of the 17th October must be my excuse for including in it more than one subject-matter. I have, &amp; ® HARLES M _ MARLINa Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Oonsid-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther, (Telegraphic.) P. Bagdad, November 12, 1910. REFERRING to my telegram of the 8th instant and to your Excellency’s telegram of the 10th instant, I regret to report that British reputation at Bagdad has fallen to ary low ebb, and I find that British subjects are seriousty alarmed, seeing that their rights have never hitherto been so trampled upon here. For four months past they have been suffering from illegal oppression, from which there is no sign of any redress to come visible. A prosperous merchant, Abdul Ali, has talked of renouncing his 11 British nationality for Turkish, and several British Indians have actually done so. If I I * have so far failed to show your Excellency the serious nature of the situation, it has been only because I was unwilling to appear alarmist. The vali is incompetent, and ”ndei the influence of unscrupulous and ignorant underlings, and it is with regret that I am reduced to the conviction that he must be removed and replaced by a more intelligent man. J Yesterday they demolished part of the two storied building, No. 6, with circum stances of injury and insult, and have continued doing so to-day. The violence of the local authorities increases daily, and I can only conclude the Minister of the Interior is misleading your Excellency. The vali appears to treat the question as a personal one, and the next thing will be expropriations, which will cause great and as yet unforeseen losses to British subjects if carried out on the same lines as the demolitions. Could your Excellency not obtain compensation in even one case ? It would to some extent allay the panic. Immediate payment to the ice manufacturer, whose case is clear would effect this purpose. ^ The Bagdad municipality loan should not, I think, be entrusted to the present local Government, or, at any rate, not given till the amount of compensation payable to British subjects for the demolitions and prospective expropriations has been discussed and approved by His Majesty s Embassy. The loan will certainly be misspent, and the city will thus be saddled to no purpose with a heavy debt for a generation. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Sir G. Lowther, (1 ele^aphic.) R Bagdad, November 14, 1910. KEFERRING to my telegram of the 12th November last, I anticipate that I shall soon learn that a block of lofty houses owned by some Indian nawabs, to which I did not refer in my despatch of the 5th September last, will have been expropriated on scandalously unfair conditions. Meanwhile, notice has been sent to Lynch’s manager of the expropriation of 3^ metres from the front of his office and warehouse, the expropriation to take effect in fifteen days, and compensation being fixed at 424 Turkish liras only. The unscrupulous character of the proceedings is shown by the fact that Lynch’s manager estimates the v cost of rebuilding on a new alignment would amount to some 1,184 liras, while the estimate made in my despatch of the 5th September came to 1,250 liras. The total claim made by Lynch amounts to 2,396 liras, i.e., for buildings which will now be expropriated 1,828 liras, for wall and shops wrongfully demolished 568 liras, though there is perhaps room for discussion regarding the items of the cost of recon struction.

Telegram P., No. 941, dated (and received) the 9th October 1910. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Please refer to paragraph 5, first enclosure of my letter No. 2529, dated feeptember 18th. Owing to attitude of Wali in regard to status of Kuwait and animosity existing between him and Shaikh Mubarak, I did Dot think that course suggested by Shaik of Mohammerah was then advisable or that it would be welcome by Mubarak. The position has since been modified bv the Wali’s recall and Kuwait now names two Mohammerah subjects living in Turkish limits and suggests that we should demand their surrender to us on the ground that the piracy took place on the high seas for the security of which we have made ourselves responsible.5 the high seas, where the British Government took upon itself to maintain peace and order. He pointed out— and t there is considerable’truth in the argument—that if some of the murderers, whose names are now all known and who are recognised as subjects of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, escape punishment by sheltering in Turkish territory with the cognizance of Turkish officials piracy will become a profit able industry and a considerable recrudescence may be expected. It was of course impossible for k haikh Khazal to arrest them unless they set foot within his juris- diction (at present and for some time to come a most unlikely contingency) and s ould they be so foolish as to do so, the possibility of reprisals similar to the recent incident at Zain would probably make Shaikh Khazal disinclined to risk his own interests in an effort to assist Mubarak, close as is the friendship between them I made no comments and contented myself with telling the Shaikh that I would lay his views before you. He has been to considerable trouble and expense to trace the culprits and consequently perhaps feels rather sore and disappointed at being unable to lay them by the heels. 6 4. In my humble opinion Shaikh Mubarak’s attitude can hardly be called unreasonable in view of the undoubted fact that all native craft plying these waters and indeed as far up the Shatt al-Arab as Mohammerah or Basran, whether for pearl- diving, carrying date-produce or in the ordinary course of trade, trust implicitly to the security afforded by years of the policework of His Majesty’s ships. In mv recent tour a ong the pearl-banks this implicit trust that all craft were perfectly safe even without weapons was frequently brought very forcibly to my notice and it seems to me that there is a danger of that confidence in our will, if not in our power, to maintain the security of these waters, being shaken. Though the danger may probably not be immediate, it is significant that the non-apprehension of the perpetrators of this particular piracy should be discussed in the way related, and it requires but a few similarly successful excursions on the part of such lawless’spirits for the danger to become a reality. It is for this reason that I have ventured to lay the matter before you m some detail in the hope that some means may be devised to bring about either the surrender of the culprits for trial on Kuwait or their adequate punishment by Turkish authorities. 5. Shaikh Mubarak has furnished me with the names of four more persons ascertained to have been concerned in the piracy; details regarding them are given in the annexure to this letter. 6. His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah furnished me with a copy of his letter No. 962 of the 2nd September 1910 to your address on the same subject in which he puts forward the difficulties from the Mohammerah point of view As he very truly remarks the bond fides of the Turkish officials are open to grave suspicion, and it is this fact which hampers both Shaikhs in all their dealings with them. Unless theWaliof Basrah or the Qaimaqam at Fao can control the Turkish side of the river in some more efficient fashion than is exposed by paragraph 6 of Captain Wilson’s letter it would seem not improbable that their efforts°to prevent piracy may have an exactly contrary effect, especially if the men concerned in the Kuwait “ boom ” case find they can go scot-free, secure in their fictitious claim to Turkish nationality. Both Shaikh Khazal and Shaikh Mubarak are vitally interested in preventing piracies on the river, more especially at the present time when date export is commencing. Their co-operation in suppressing piracy and bringing offenders to book may, therefore, be counted upon without question, thus leaving as the only uncertain factor Turkish methods and means, confidence in which is not inspired by the Fao Qaimaqam’s'action in regard to Saleh, or the Wall’s support of his subordinate in the matter.

Until the pearling season is finished, which will bo shortly, it would be convenient if she remained in the north of the Gulf for general work.

I have since informed the Minister of Foreign A hairs that, in virtue of instructions received from His Majesty’s Government, I am holding the central Government responsible for the amounts in question. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to sec how . the local authorities at Bagdad can indemnify the British subjects without laying themselves open to similar claims by Ottoman subjects who have suffered similarly, and it may be easier for the central Government to settle these matters direct with His Majesty’s Embassy. As regards the Sheikh of Koweit’s lands at Fadaghia, the information as to details, &amp;e., supplied by His Majesty’s officers in those regions differs considerably from that in the hands of the Minister of the Interior, and the latter proposes waiting the arrival in Constantinople of Ahmed Pasha-as-Zoheir, who is expected in a few days. The Minister declares that he has no knowledge of the alleged appointment of mudirs to Wakra and Zobara, and he has telegraphed to Bussorah for information on the subject. As regards Zakhnuniyeh, 1 am still awaiting confirmation from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah of the execution of the orders for evacuation. I have made further representations to the Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding the difficulty of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. The Minister has promised to again speak to his colleague of Public Works on the subject.

They were at once surrendered on demand to the Sheikh ot Mohammerah by Mubarak, and imprisoned. The remainder came from Maamar-ud-Daura, near Fao on th Turkish side. Application was made to the vali in the matter by the sheikh. A lis giving the names of them all was also furnished to the vali. He sent down police who, according to my information, were told by the headman of Daura, one Bin Naghaim, a Turkish subject, that he would consent to no enquiry or search, and if any attempt to do so were made it would be resisted by force. The Turkish police went away without doing anything. . The vali a few days after wrote to the sheikh that, after careful enquiry, it had been found that the persons mentioned in his list were not guilty of complicity in the piracy, and that Bin Naghaim had furthermore expressed his willingness to point out the real culprits, who lived in Mohammerah. Sheikh Khazal replied asking for Bin Naghaim to be sent for to Bussorah, where he might make good his words. He has heard no more about it since, as Bin Naghaim is not the least likely to come to Bussorah. Pirates, moreover, do not choose Mohammerah as their residence. I may add that the information regarding the guilt of men in Daura was quite independently obtained by Shakespear from Mubarak, who said that one of his men had witnessed the division of the spoils. The vali has done nothing whatever to arrest or make enquiry into this matter, though asked to do so more than once. Apparently he has been fooled in this case, as in the Zain case, by his police. In the Zain case they made him believe his authority as being flouted. In this case, when it is openly defied, they assure him that “ careful enquiry ” has been made, &amp;c. The third piracy on record is that of the 29th June. A Koweit boom, Nakhuda Salih-al-Hajri. The whole crew were murdered, eight men in all, the boom looted and scuttled. This took place on the high seas south of Koweit. The pirates were nine in number. All came from Saniyah, or Katah, in the Dawasir district, Turkish territory, except one man of Kasbat-al-Nassar, who has been arrested and imprisoned by the sheikh. The vali was asked by Sheikh Khazal unofficially to arrest the men in Dawasir, of whom the sheikh showed a list. I am informed the vali declined to take any steps in the matter owing to the lack of legal proof, or some excuse of the sort. He, however, claimed that the man arrested by the sheikh in Kasbat-al-Nassar was a Turkish subject, and wanted Sheikh-al-Khazal to release him, which he very properly declined to do. The man’s father and mother are living in Kasbat-al-Nassar, and he is, I have no doubt, a Persian subject. As regards concerted measures for the prevention of piracy, the vali and^ the sheikh have made some arrangement for patrolling the river Avith bellams containing representatives of either side, but the vali’s attitude in the proved cases of piracy which have been referred to him has been so disappointing, doubtless on account of his political obsessions, that the sheikh is not very hopeful as to the result of concerted action. I am inclined to share the sheikh’s pessimism. The pirates are well aware that their names are known to the Turks. They see that no action of any kind is being taken against them by the vali, though anyone who happens to be a Persian subject has been promptly arrested. They will no doubt become bolder later on.

I would also venture to submit that any written mention at the present of our relations with latter would intensify suspicions fomented by Germany and her local organ here of our aggressive intentions in South Persia.

I IU\ L received your Excellency s despatch No. (503 of the 22nd August and other reports, in which you enumerate repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexatious treatment ol British subjects m Asiatic Turkey, and, further, draw my attention to A, num,,ei of incidents ol political aggression, all tending to a disturbance of the re^™n7tL h p h llave ,recently marked the conduct of the Ottoman authorities in the region 01 the Jrersian Gull. It will be convenient to deal first with the injustice to which British commercial interests have been subjected. In July the representative of Messrs. Lynch and Co. at Bagdad was informed that certam property of Ins firm would, under a municipal regulation, be demolished as msec me and dangerous. I he British Consul-General found that the property which he took an early opportunity of inspecting, was perfectly safe. A few days later a notification was made to Messrs. Abdul Ali, a British-Indian hrm, respecting the projected demolition, on similar grounds, of their principal shoo and the arbitrary expropriation of the site, which is a valuable one. This property was likewise found, on inspection, to be 111 excellent condition and in no wise dangerous 1 he British Consul-General hereupon visited the President of the Municipality and protested vigorously against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext oi danger to the public The conclusion drawn by His Majesty’s Consul-General was that, m the absence of funds to meet the cost of legal expropriation, the procedure complained ol had been adopted. Notwithstanding that your Excellency had in the meantime made urgent representations through the Minister of the Interior, an extensive demolition of Messrs. Lynchs property, including their chief office, was begun on the 7th August and more recently His Majesty’s Consul-General has reported that the property of British subjects alieady demolished and threatened means a loss of some £ T. f) 000 ■ while he learns that it is proposed to enforce further expropriations, at great loss to many British subjects resident in Bagdad. On the 29th September your Excellency reported that British-Indian property at Kazimia and Kerbela had likewise been demolished, and that the Vali had declined any indemnification on grounds which are wholly unconvincing. His Majesty’s Government must emphatically protest against this procedure ; they must further, in view of the fact that it has originated with the Vali, hold the Ottoman Government themselves responsible for the damage already inflicted, and, after receiving a report as to its precise extent from His Majesty’s Consul-General, your Excellency should present a detailed claim to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before leaving the question of these expropriations, I think it necessary to advert to the rumoured intention of the A ali of Bagdad to cause a new road to be constructed through the middle of the grounds of His Majesty’s Consulate-General, whereas by making a slight deviation it might be made to follow an existing road : it is true that after your Excellency had made representations to the Sublime Porte, the Vali asserted to His Majesty’s Consul-General that no interference with the Consulate buildings had been in contemplation: 1 feel constrained to observe that the local evidence to the contrary effect is of a conclusive character. Two further cases of unwarrantable interference with British interests have also recently occurred at Bagdad :— In the first of these cases Messrs. Abdul Ali, the British-Indian firm already referred to, were suddenly ordered to sell the ice manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of 20 paras an oke, their usual charge: I understand that owing to non-compliance with this arbitrary order the local authorities have threatened to close by force two ice factories belonging to British Indian subjects. [2930 r—4]In the second case two British, firms, Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. and Messrs. Blaney and Solomon, were informed that they must transfer their factories to the outskirts of the town, on the pretext of a regulation 4G years old concerning steam- engines and boilers, whereas, as your Excellency has pointed out to me, the factories in question are run by smokeless oil-engines, which are in no respect dangerous. There is clearly, therefore, no ground whatever for the application of the regulation to these factories, and its enforcement would be wholly unreasonable and very burdensome to the owners. Your Excellency should insist upon satisfaction being accorded to all these British subjects and afford to them the full and effectual protection of His Majesty’s Government, who cannot admit a continuance of the oppression to which they are being subjected. You should add that His Majesty’s Government cannot be expected to acquiesce in the helplessness expressed by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to the illegal proceedings of the Bagdad authorities, and that such helplessness on the part of the central authorities amounts to an abdication of Government. I have already furnished your Excellency with full instructions on the subject of the forcible and unjust intervention of the Ministry of Public Works in the dispute which has arisen between the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company and the Societe des Quais : it is matter for grave concern to His Majesty’s Government that, apart from this particular incident, the Board of this Company should be compelled to complain that “ for the past two years the attitude of the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works has been increasingly overbearing and harassing,” and that they should have claimed the active protection of His Majesty’s Government “not only on account of the important material interests involved in the present case, but also in view of the systematic and continuous attempts which are now being made to encroach on the Company’s rights and privileges as laid down in its Conventions with the Imperial Ottoman Government.” I pass now to the incidents of political aggression. On the 30th May, 1909, I informed your Excellency that the Turks had some time previously occupied the island of Zakhnuniyeh, which lies some 10 miles south-east of Ujair; that they had hoisted the Turkish flag on a fort, and had arranged to keep a guard there; that the Sheikh of Bahrein had protested to His Majesty’s Government against this occupation, his father having built the fort, where he used to keep a garrison, fifty years ago ; and that the island, which had no permanent inhabitants, had been regularly visited for purposes of fishing, by natives of Bahrein. I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise concerns the Ottoman Government: I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well-nigh a century. Moreover, as your Excellency is aware, in November and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. But apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. In these circumstances your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo ; and your representations were to be based not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south-east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction. Although the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed your Excellency that the garrison had been withdrawn in June 1909, it has since been reinstated in the island, and, according to the latest reports, has quite recently been reinforced : and the Ottoman authorities in regard to this question seem set upon disregarding your Excellency’s repeated representations on the subject. I have accordingly to instruct your Excellency to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison. The next point upon which I desire to address your Excellency is the treatmentVnli vl nf V he S1 f kli •?/ KoW i t has been subjected by Suleiman Nazif Bey the late ln«I . t u 1 ’ W1 1 t !, re gard to the property which he purchased, in the’course of last yeai, from Ahmed Pasha-el-Zoheir at a price of £, T nnn ^'TnVi i i down When Wc T , Sheikh Mubm-ekhK^o W luikish I-and Office he was informed that he must register himself as a Turkish subject : such a demand in reference to a transfer of land had never before been made c excellency should inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Maiestv’s Oovernment regard the conduct of the late Vali in this matter as an at en.h t J rt the status quo with regard to Koweit, which is the basis of the understanding between H.s Majesty s Government and the Ottoman Government in this imporLnt question t,- 11 Mpears, moreover, from reliable and circumstantial reports, that the late Vali aefkh y M 0 ubZk^ m title TU the Vendor °i the Feda g hi a Property to impugn absurdity of repudiating the salehn\l~ ^ well aHhat ophe' BriiLTconsul! 6 VeDd01 '’ b ° re th ° Se ° f aU the B ~ h '-‘^es His Majesty’s Government rely upon the Ottoman Government to briim obont n sabsfactory settlement of the registration of this property; thev have no wish to raise difficulties with regard to the past conduct of an official who has since been recalled • but I must add that the incident is vexatious, and serves to deepen the impression entertained by His Majesty s Government of ill-will on the part of the Turkish officials. V r U f p 1S iecent ciea J in ^ s . wlt { 1 Sheikh of Mohammerah the conduct of the late ^ a^ of Pussorah has been in the highest degree violent, vindictive, and unjust. M. * + , lb kno ™ t0 Hls Majesty’s Government from reports received from His Majesty s Consul at Bussorah that there were no disturbances of importance on the Shat-el-Arab during last winter, that the Sheikh recently exercised his good o ices m the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between the Vali and an important Arab chief of Turkish nationality, and that the Sheikh has in fact carried his conciliatory attitude towards Nazif Bey so far as to acquiesce without complaint m the destruction of houses belonging to him at Bussorah. It is further known through His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah that Sheikh endeavoured to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and rusht-i-Kuh. Such was the situation at the end of March last when the Sheikh appeared still to be on the best of terms. Shortly afterwards, however, the' Vali brought against the Sheikh certain accusations into the nature of which it is unnecessary to enter m detail, since your Excellency is already familiar with it from the correspondence which has passed on the subject. No serious proof of the truth of these accusations was ever offered, nor was any opportunity ever given to the Sheikh to disprove the charges brought against him, which he was perfectly able and willing to do. On the contrary, the Vali totally ignored a friendly and conciliatory letter addressed to him by the Sheikh, expressing the intention of proceeding to Bussorah to discuss the matters in dispute, and, further, on the Sheikh’s arrival there on the fbth April, most unjustifiably and discourteously refused to receive him at all. Khazal has the Vali of and the Vali ali is The Sheikh had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah. On the 24th April the \ ali issued circular instructions to the local officials under his jurisdiction summarily to remove all headmen dependent on the Sheikh, and on the 25th April during the latter’s absence at Ahwaz, the Turkish gun-boat “ Marmaris,” actino on the orders of Nazif Bey. shelled the village of Zain belonging to the Sheikh, which was afterwards looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers. In the course of this attack the house of the Sheikh’s mother was burnt, and one of his wives died from shock caused by the bombardment. On the 26th April the Vali, in two official letters addressed to the Persian Consul at Bussorah, went so far as to threaten action against Mohammerah itself in the event of failure to comply with his demands. In spite of the injury and provocation which he had received, Sheikh Khazal continued to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government by maintaining a conciliatory attitude, by restraining his agents and supporters from any aggressive action, and by adopting their suggestions with respect to the wording &amp; of his communications with the Vali. The latter, on the contrary, displayed strong lesentment at the attempts made by His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, to promote an understandino- between him and the Sheikh.Nazif Bey, it is true, finally accepted Sheikh Khazal’s explanations and agreed to consider the incident closed, but lie unconditionally refused to express regret for the death of the Sheikh’s wife and the destruction of his mother’s house, or to pay any compensation for the losses suffered by the Sheikh in consequence of the unjustifiable bombardment of Zain. Further, at the very moment when he was considering the Sheikh’s explanations with which he owned himself satisfied, his agents were occupied in subjecting the Sheikh to further petty annoyances in the matter of the renewal, contrary to the Vali’s promise, of the lawsuit against the servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s agent at Bussorah, of the unjustified destruction, for the third time since the dispute between the Sheikh and the Vali began, of the former’s house property on the Ashar Creek and of the raid on Mirza Hamza’s house and the seizure of his property, on the ground that he had disregarded a summons for debt which had been issued against him. There can be little doubt that Nazif Bey was the real instigator of these vexatious proceedings. A further injustice to the Sheikh has now been committed by the decree recently issued by the Sublime Porte forbidding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah in the name of the Sheikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be actually contrary to Ottoman law. Your Excellency should bring these facts to the notice of the Turkish Government, and inform them that I iis Majesty’s Government are bound, by agreement with the Sheikh, to use their good offices on his behalf in the event of a dispute with a foreign Power, that they have most carefully considered the circumstances of his recent dispute with the Vali of Bussorah, and cau see no justification whatever for the harsh and aggressive action of the latter, especially in the matter of the attack on Zain, nor for the recent decree of the Porte regarding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah. You should add that, in view of their obligations towards the Sheikh, they cannot allow the status quo on the Shat-el-Arab to be altered to his detriment 1 , and you should express the hope that a satisfactory arrangement will be arrived at with the Sheikh, who has displayed anxiety to live on good terms with his neighbours, and has shown, throughout recent events, great self-restraint and patience, in marked contrast—as His Majesty’s Government observe with regret—with the attitude of the Turkish authorities. These occurrences, which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced, in their cumulative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities,—an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint : in taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty’s Government have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of course arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.

He was invited to send the owner in to Bushire to give detailed information and the man arrived on 27th May and gave his statement which was recorded. No one was murdered, and the dhow was allowed to go after bein^ relieved of her contents, valued at about Rs. 2,500. It appeared that the piracy had been perpetrated on 7th or 8th March. The sufferers had appealed to Shaikh Khazal but nothing special had as yet resulted, though they heard that the Shaikh had been making enquiries and had effected some arrests. * On reference to the Shaikh of Mohammerah who was addressed urgently it was ascertained that he had, as the result of his enquiries, been led to suspect some former subjects of his, now in exile in Kuwait. He bad asked ShaikhMubarak to surrender them and this the latter did. Later on, however, Shaikh Mubarak wrote to Shaikh Khazal saying that he had received certain evidence that two of the men sent had not been concerned in any way, and asked for their release. As Shaikh Mubarak had surrendered them readily, Shaikh Khazal felt bound to comply. Two were released and the other retained in prison. At this juncture occurred the incident between the Shaikh and the Vali of Basrah arising from the bombardment of Zain. I now attach a report on the subject from His Majesty’s Consul, Moham- merah, which brings the matter to date. Bushire: P* Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, September igio. ) Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 865 , dated Mohammerah, the 18 th August 1910 . From— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I. A. Acting Consul, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence on the subject of a piracy that took place near the second buoy, on the 7th or 8th March; the vessel belonging to Agha Saiyid Hussain of Bandar Rig. 2. I am now in a position to state further developments in this case. It will be recollected that the value of property and cash stolen was estimated by the Nakhuda at about Krans 10,000, and that Shaikh Khazal demanded the surrender of three men, ex-Shaikhs of Gusbah, from Mubarak in connection with the robbery. One of these is still in confinement ; the other two were released at the request of Shaikh Mubarak. 3. Haji Sultan, the Shaikh’s agent at Gusbah, was informed of the piracy about the 8th March, made enquiries locally without delay and found that certain persons were implicated, residents of Daura and Maamra on the Turkish side: he gave their names to Sha kh Khazal and to the Nakhuda. He further stated that it was common knowledge that the goods and cash (6,000 krans) | were divided up in Daura near Maamra, in the lands of one Shaikh Naghaim, a Turkish subject. 4. The information that Shaikh Mubarak gave the Political Agent at Kuwait in regard to these facts corroborates the above story in almost every detail. 5. The Vali’s precipitate action in regard to Kut-i-Zain made it impossible for the Shaikh to make formal complaint at the time, as the detailed enquiries were only completed at the end of April, whilst the bombardment of Zain took place on the 23rd, and tension had existed several days previously. 6. In the last week of July, however, when some semblance of friendly relations had been restored, Shaikh Khazal wrote to the Vali^ officially, giving full details of the piracy, and asking that an official might be directed to proceed to Maamra to make enquiries into the matter on the spot, and promising every assistance from his agents at Gusbah in identifying the criminals, etc. A few days later, a police commissaire was sent by the Vali to Mohammerah, and thence to Gusbah, after receiving letters of recommendation to Haji Sultan from the Shaikh. I am informed by Haji Rais, that, on their arrival at Gusbah, they were treated with every consideration by Haji Sultan, who sent a man with them to Maamra to identify the alleged pirates. He could not have gone himself without arousing suspicion amongst those whom it was desired to apprehend. It appears from his letters to the Shaikh, to which I have had access, that, on the arrival of the police, and on learning that they intended to make a search for stolen property, and to arrest persons, Shaikh Naghaim threatened to call out his men and kill the whole gang, and declined to allow them to enter the villages, or hold any enquiry. It is certain that they did nothing and arrested no one.6. The Vali has now replied to the Shaikh’s letter: he states that careful enquiry in the presence of Haji Sultan has shown that none of the stolen property was landed in Turkish soil, and further states that Shaikh Naghaim has said that he knew who the robbers were, that they were all in Mohammerah, and that if he went there he could point them out. 7. The absurdity of the last statement is evident: pirates operating near the outer buoy do not live at Mohammerah, and Shaikh Naghaim is not well acquainted with Mohammerah. The “ careful enquiry ” moreover, did not take place in the presence of Haji Sultan, and it seems doubtful whether it took place at all. 8. The incident seems to me to be a further instance of the facility with which the subordinate Turkish officials are able to deceive the Vali, in the same way as they did in the case of Muhammad Chanan at Zain. It also seems to show that the ability and determination of the Turkish authorities to cope with river piracy is more doubtful than Mr. Consul Crow seems to think. In this case, I am led by the evidence to conclude that the Turks have allowed piratical Arabs to intimidate them, without taking any steps to punish them, and that the Turkish police cover up their defeat by the old plea that the culprits live in Mohammerah. Encouraged in this way, pirates will doubtless resume their operations when the boats come up for the date season. 9. I may add that the number of British sailing craft entering Mohammerah in 1909 was 86, the corresponding number for Basrah being 30. The larger figure for Mohammerah is due to the fact that there is no export duty on dates from Mohammerah, and that the cheaper sorts, for the Indian market, are mainly grown. The safety of the river is therefore a matter of importance to Mohammerah even more than to Basrah, and I note, therefore, with great regret that it has been decided not to depute one of His Majesty’s ships for the protection of British sailing craft this year. There seems reason to fear a recrudescence of piracy on the river, for which the Mohammerah authorities will be blamed, although the direct cause of it will be the failure of the Turks to take any action in the definite case referred to above, when it was referred to them by Shaikh Khazal. 0 .

India, copies of further correspondence on the subject of piracy in, and at the mouth of, the Shatt-el-Arab, with special reference to my letter No. 2397, dated l^! 1 4th September 1910. 2. The fear expressed in paragraph 2 of the latter communication has been realised, and it will be seen from the second enclosure above cited that the Shaikh failed to arrive at any satisfactory arrangement with the Vali in regard to the apprehension of the rest of the gang. 3. With regard to the general question of piracy in, and near the Shatt-el- Arab, Lieutenant Wilson’s letter of 13th September indicates that the Shaikh is exercised by the non-arrival of one of His Majesty’s Ships this season as usual. 4. I am, therefore, profiting by the presence of H. M. S. “ Redbreast’’j which has been placed at my disposal by His Excellency the Commander-in- Chief in connection with recent cases of piracy, to send her up the Shatt-el-Arab as far as Mohammerah in order that the piratical contingent residing near the mouth of the river may take note of her presence and the Shaikh of Mohammerah be somewhat reassured. The danger zone is the part of the river between Mohammerah and the outer buoy where joint ownership prevents either party from taking effective measures for its suppression. Pending any action that Government may feel able to take on paragraph 2 of my letter No. 2398, dated 4th September, I shall not feel justified in keeping her permanently in the river and on her return she will cruise at the northern end of the Gulf, and will be available at short notice for any emergency that may arise. No. 962 , dated Mohammerah, the ' September 1910 . From— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, LA., Acting Consul, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the prevention of piracy A. Resident, No. 2029, dated 26th July 1910, to Consul. B. Consul, No. 865, of iSth August 1910, to Resident. C.

Political Agent, Kuwait’s No. 519 of 24th August 1910, to Resident. in the Shatt-el-Arab, and to refer to the marginally noted correspondence on the subject. 2. The Shaikh has been in Basrah for two days with the Vali and, in deference to your request, to which I have repeatedly adverted in conversation with him, has made some suggestions for concerted action with a view to prevent piracy on the river. The Vali seemed to welcome his proposals, and promised to proceed to Qasbat and Fao with him to make arrangements in this connection. 3. The Shaikh has, however, no confidence in the Vali’s sincerity, and is rather nervous in regard to the whole question of joint action and diplomaticdealings with the Turks generally. He was not reassured by the attitude of the Qaimmaqam of Fao, who, as soon as he heard of the arrest of Salih by Shaikh Khazal, at the request of Shaikh Mubarak, in connection with the Kuwiat boom piracy, demanded his release on the grounds that he was a Turkish subject, (a wholly fictitious claim, I believe). 4. The question is greatly complicated by the fact that the Vali is on bad terms with Shaikh Mubarak, and were Shaikh Khazal to ask for the surrender of the other men wanted in the Kuwait piracy case, (who all live in ur ish territory), on the ground that their surrender had been asked for by Shaikh Mubarak, the Vali would at once refuse. Were he to apply for them on the ground that they w r ere his tribesmen, as they undoubtedly are, the Vali would equally certainly refuse, on the ground that he does not admit the claim of the Shaikh to exercise tribal jurisdiction of any kind in regard to Arabs living temporarily or permanently on Turkish soil. Shaikh Khazal contemplates, however, asking for the surrender of these men as pirates wanted by him, for offences in which his subjects are concerned, and will support his request by pointing out that unless they are apprehended piracies will recur, and involve Turkish and Persian authorities in trouble with foreign Governments. 5. He suggests, as an alternative, that we should write to the Vali of Basrah asking for the surrender of these men to us, on the ground that the piracy took place on the high seas. This course seems to be open to objection but I am not aware of the rules and precedents governing such cases. 6 The Shaikh mentioned the attitude of Shaikh bin Naghaim at Maamrah (Daura), near Fao, when police enquiries were being made in regard to his alleged complicity in the piracies of 2nd and 24th Safar ; he found that the Vali was unaware of the fact that the Turkish police had been flouted and facilities for search or enquiry refused ; he, however, promised to make further enquiry, and to send for bin Naghaim to be brought to Basrah. As bin Naghaim will probably refuse to come, further developments may be expected. 7. The Shaikh’s attitude is, I think, satisfactory, and I believe he is only deterred from more active measures by fully justified suspicion of the bona fides of the Turkish officials. No. 971, dated 7th September 1910. From—L ieutenant A. T. Wilson, I. A., His Majesty’s Acting Consul, Mohammerah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report, with reference to my letter No. 962 of and instant that, on the 4th instant, the Vali of Basrah accompanied the Shaikh to Fao with the object of making some joint arrangement for bellams, with the representatives of either side, to patrol the river mouth. Some such arrangement is said to have been made. The Vali, however, supported the Quaimmaqam o Fao in asserting that Salih was a Turkish subject, and altogether refused to do anything in regard to the remainder of the gang in 1 urkish territory, when asked to arrest them by Shaikh Khazal. 2. The Shaikh refused to give up Salih, pointing out that he was born in Qasbat-al-Nassar, had a house there, and that his father and mother were still living in that village. ^ No. 987, dated Mohammerah, the 12th September 1910.

In continuation of my letter No. 971, of the 7th instant, I have the honour to inform you that I interviewed the Shaikh on the nth instant at Faihyah.2. In regard to the Kuwait boom piracy, he informed me that his visit to Fao with the Vali had so.far been productive of no result. The Vali had, he thought, dropped the question of the nationality of Salih, but had persisted in refusing to take any action in regard to the men accused by Shaikh Mubarak of complicity in the boom piracy of the 29th June. 3. In reply to Shaikh Khazal’s request for their surrender to him, on the ground that they were his tribesmen living on Turkish soil, accused of an offence on the high seas, and that without the Vali’s permission he could consequently not arrest them, the Vali briefly remarked that the piracy was a Kuwait complaint and that he could therefore take no action. He put the list which Shaikh Khazal had prepared, of their names and addresses, into his pocket, and, as far as is known, proposes to do nothing in the matter. 4. In regard to concerted measures for the prevention of piracy, Shaikh Khazal informs me that it was arranged that six bellams, manned by joint Turkish*Persian crews, should patrol the river mouth. His bellams and his men are ready, but the representatives of the Turkish Government have not yet appeared. He seems to expect that they will eventually be sent however.

I have the honour to state that, on the occasion of my last visit to Failiyah. Shaikh Khazal took occasion to enquire when he might expect to see the usual gunboat arrive for duty in the river in connection with the suppression of piracy. 2. He said that he presumed, from the anxiety that we had showm in discussing the matter with him, that we also should take special precautions and not leave the burden of patrolling solely to him. 3. In this connection I may mention a persistent rumour, which seems to have obtained wide circulation locally, to the effect that the Turks have prohibited British warships from entering the Shatt-el-Arab.

Prates recognised and identified by Shaikh’s representative at Qasbat-al- Nassa. Three of them reported to be refugee Shaikhs of Qasbat-al-Nassar who live at Kuwait. They were at once surrendered, on demand, to the Shaikh of Mohammerah by Mubarak, and imprisoned. The remainder came from Maamar ud Daura, near Fao, on the Turkish side. Application was made to the Vali in the matter by tbe Shaikh. A list giving the names of them all was also furnished to the Vali. He sent down police who, according to my information, were toldby the headman of Daura, one bin Naghaim, a Turkish subject that he would b rested b? foZ' ry T r h Se T C 1 ’-T d l ^ attem ' ,t t0 do 50 -de, it Zld be resisted by force. 1 he Turkish police went away without doing anything.

It is satisfactory to find that the identity of the pirates has been estab lished and two of their number apprehended, but I fear it is probable that the unsatisfactory relations existing between the Vali of Basrah and the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah may complicate the task of effecting the apprehension of the rest. Shaikh Khazal will however be sure to do his best in the interests of Shaikh Mubarak, and as regards his general obligations it will be apparent from the enclosed extract from the last Mohammerah Diary that he is endea* vouring to act up to them.

The Shaikh informed me that the 'bellum” originally suspected has been found to be innocent, as also six other boats from the Shatt-el-Arab, whose Na- khudas, owing to Shaikh Khazal’s help, Shaikh Mubarak has been able to inter rogate. Nor has anything been gleaned from enquiries southwards beyond the fact that the pirate Ahmad bin Salman accompanied by a crew of Bam Hajir Arabs had started out. This notorious pirate is reported to have made no ex cursion to the north, and to have recently retreated to some lair near Katif; it is said he proposes to confine his efforts to the Katif and Katar coasts and the vicinity of Ojair. Enclosure 2. No. 519 (Confidential), dated Kuwait, the 24th August 1910 . From—CAPTAIN W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—L ieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to my letter No. 437, dated the 6th August 1910, I have the honour to report that evidence has been obtained by Shaikh Mubarak which it is hoped will lead to the early apprehension of the perpetrators of the piracy on the Kuwait “ boom ” belonging to Saleh al Hajri, and that two of the culprits are already in the Shaikh’s prison awaiting trial. 2. It appears that the Shaikh’s secret enquiries on the river led to suspicion being directed to a certain “ bellum ” which frequently trades between the Shatt- el-Arab and Kuwait. The Nakhuda and most of the crew were known in Kuwait and a watch was accordingly kept on their movements. One or two of the crew visited Kuwait some weeks ago apparently to ascertain if the excitement caused by the piracy had died down and whether enquiries were still being made. The Shaikh allowed them to leave without taking any immediate steps in the hope that confidence might bring the Nakhuda or others to Kuwait.o On the 18th August the Nakhuda, Sahaim bin Qaid, arrived in the pirate ' bellum ” accompanied by one of the suspected crew,^ with ghi and other articles for sale. Both the men were apprehended and confined separately. At nrst both denied all connection with the piracy, but eventually the younger man Zahir, agreed to turn informer if promised a pardon. This the Shaikh granted and the story the informer gave is as follows:— The Nakhuda of the “ bellum ” Sahaim bin Qa id, when visiting Kuwaiti became aware of what Saleh al Hajri proposed taking in his “boom to the pearhbanks and the probable date of his sailing. He planned trm piracy and accordingly sailed back to the river to pick up arms and ammunition at Rabthda near Saniya. Having done this he brought the bellum back and remained sailing about to the south of Falaikha Island on watch until Saleh al Hajn’s “ boom ” should set out. Saleh al Hajri sailed on the 28th June in the afternoon and on perceiving her the pirate “bellum ” made off on an eastward tack as if to clear Falaikha l sland for the Persian coast, then with the advantage of weather position suddenly veered round and sailed down on the Kuwait “ boom’' She reached^ her some time after noon on the following day, the 29th June off Ras al Ijlaieh and ran her down amidships, her crew firing at those on board the boom. Most of the latter were shot on board and the rest jumped over board to save themselves but were pursued in a dinghy and shot in the water, no one being left alive. 1 he pirate crew then removed everything in the Kuwait “ boom ” to their own vessel and scuttled her as already reported. The pirate “bellum went off and sheltered some days up the Bahmishir River and eventually got back to the Shatt-el-Arab after her crew had gradually disposed of the loot which had already been shared. 4. The informer gave the names of the pirate crew and where they were to be found and the Shaikh has sent to try and apprehend them. c The names of the men murdered in the Kuwait “ boom ” and those of the pirate crew as hitherto ascertained are given in the annexure attached hereto. 6. I am informed by the Shaikh that the pirates are all Shiah Arabs of the Cha’ab tribe under the authority of Shaikh Khazal, though their present residence is on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and so in Turkish territory. Ihe Shaikh anticipates no difficulty in dealing with them, however, on this score as the men are well known in Kuwait and Mohammerah and there is no chance of their churning to be Turkish subjects, their position being analogous to a large number of Shaikh Khazal’s subjects who for purposes of date-tillage reside in Turkish territory. The Shaikh is endeavouring to secure further evidence by recovering some of the looted property. At present there is only the informer’s story and marks on the “ bellum ” which show she has charged another vessel with some consi derable force.

CONFIDENTIAL. [31386] [August 29.] Section 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 29.) (No. 603.) } SiTj Ttierapia A.uyust 2^ 1910 ON the 5th July I received a telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to the effect that, according to information from the resident at Bushire, Turkish soldiers had again leturned to the island of Zakhnuniyeh and that the Turkish flag was hoisted theie on Fridays, and later received the despatch from Mr. Crow, copy of which is enclosed herewith. I immediately brought the matter to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and renewed my representations of the spring of last year on the lines of the instructions conveyed in your telegram of the 30th May, 1909, pointing out that the island is situated some 10 miles to the south-east of Ojair, the point recognised by His Majesty s Government as the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction in El Hassa, and that tliis violation of the status quo would only needlessly create a fresh incident. His Excellency promised to study the question and let me know the result later on, but from the evasive nature of his replies to my repeated representations of last summer I have some doubt about obtaining a definite settlement as desired by His Majesty’s Government, and suspect that the withdrawal of the military post, reported by me on the 27th September, 1909, was merely owing to the termination of the fishing season, during which the Turks pretended the presence of their gendarmes to be necessary to maintain order among the Dowasir fishermen from Bahrein who frequent the island. In a report received by the Porte from the Mutessarif of El Hassa the latter, after giving the dimensions, &amp;c., of Zakhnuniyeh, maintained that it was practically part of the mainland, thus revealing the pretensions of the Turks not only to the island but to the coast south-east of Ojair. Mr. Crow, in his telegram of the 6th August, 1910, reported that the Vali of Bussorah has now appointed a mudir, or sub-governor, at Odeid. Ail this seems to point to a determination to assert and extend Ottoman sovereignty in the neighbour hood of El Katr and it seems to me only prudent that His Majesty’s Government should make up its mind as to the attitude to be adopted towards Young Turkey’s general forward policy in the regions of the Gulf. Under the old regime we temporised, but it seems that now a more definite and direct attitude may become expedient, if not necessary. The vigorous action of the Vali of Bussorah in dealing with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and in the bombardment of Zein showed a deter mination to assert Turkish sovereign rights ; while Mr. Lorimer, in his telegram of the 16th August, records his conviction that the high-handed methods employed by the authorities of Bagdad in the matter of the demolition of Messrs. Lynch’s premises and the threatened encroachments on the residency were intended to demonstrate that foreign subjects and interests are at their mercy. This policy, if not checked, may be extended to the sepoy guard of the residency and to the “ Comet,” the presence of both of which is highly distasteful to Turkish national sentiment, whilst it is not impossible that we may eventually find a boycott, as in the case of the Greeks and Austrians, started against Lynch’s steamers with the object of driving this foreign company with its foreign flag off Turkish internal waters. The old regime was economically old- fashioned and negative as regards the assertion of its sovereign rights. After the change in July 1908, and while the Cabinet was composed of the Elder Liberal statesmen who had preserved the traditions of the A’ali Pashas and Fuad Pashas of the time of the Crimean war and after, we had pro-British demonstrations reflecting the views of the men in power, and it was felt that Young Turkey, under their guidance, would shrink from raising awkward questions as to our position at Koweit, Bagdad, Cyprus, Egypt, Ac. But it was noticed at the time that prominent committeemen took no part in these demonstrations, and seemed rather to discountenance them, and when in 1909 the committee took over the machinery of Government, the Elder Liberal statesmen and pro-British demonstrators were put in the background, and their voices and sentiments silenced by the state of siege, though the present rulers have to reckon with them to a certain extent. The committee, composed of younger men, is more modern and businesslike, while it is also more positive and self-assertive [2853/—1] B 7/ ^ 0 *7/^7 '7 7 6 )as regards the vindication of its “ national ” rights. It is not swayed by sentiment, bnt has adopted the doctrine of “ Real-Politik,” and not unnaturally believes that Young Turkey has to play a prominent, if not the principal, part in the Asiatic revival, and work in sympathy with cognate forces in Persia, Egypt, and India. In its internal form the committee appears to be a Judseo-Turkish dual alliance, the Turks supplying a splendid military material and the Jews the brain, enterprise, money (e.g., Djavid Bey’s recent loan in Paris),fand a strong press influence in Europe; while, as shown by Sionist literature since the revolution, the Jewish world seems to have now turned its eyes towards Mesopotamia as the land best suited to Jewish colonisation and the ultimate formation of a Jewish autonomous State. The Jews, who now seem to inspire and control the inside machinery of the State, and are bent on the economic and industrial capture of Young Turkey, appear determined that no important enterprise shall be started in Mesopotamia without their participation, if not control, and it is perhaps significant that the attacks on Sir William Willcocks have been led by a Jew in a Jewish organ here, and the opposition to the Lynch scheme in Turkish circles was mainly the work of Sassoon Effendi, the Jewish deputy for Bagdad. The Jews, in order to maintain their position of influence in Young Turkey circles, have to play up to, if not encourage, Turkish “nationalist” tendencies, and the two elements make a distinctly strong combination which has to be reckoned with, especially by those interested in Mesopotamia. It must, moreover, not be forgotten that the present form of constitutionalism in Turkey is not one which the masses have risen up and demanded, but is rather a form which a freethinking oligarchy have imposed on the &gt; masses at the point of the bayonet. This minority, who are also in a sense anti-clerical, have felt the necessity of replacing the old theocratic conception of the deeply religious Mussulman by a new Pan-Islamic and Pan-Asiatic creed. Again the purely Turkish element, inspired by its past traditions of conquest and its martial superiority, naturally arrogates to itself the role of protector of other Asiatic and Islamic peoples. The result I is a strong anti-Russian current, as, in their phraseology, Russia “has usurped and oppresses ” Asiatic Mussulmans, and a similar, if less strong anti-British current, owing to our position in India, Aden, Egypt, the Persian Gulf, and especially owing to the Anglo-Russian entente regarding Persia and Afghanistan. Thus the natural corollary of this perfervid Asiatic-cum-Islamic sentiment is a community of interest between Russia and England, more particularly in Persia, while France, owdng to her position in Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco also, though in a lesser degree, comes in for a share of Young Turkey’s resentment. Had Turkey’s “ constitutionalism ” been an approximation to real liberal and popular institutions, allowing a certain amount of free play to the different elements, she would, like Austria, have formed internally a natural equipoise of races, and would have felt no necessity to adopt a chauvinistic attitude in her foreign politics—an attitude which is, so to speak, potentially aggressive. The Turkish masses put up with thirty odd years of the despotism of \ildiz, and especially the severer form which obtained during the second half, he., since the Armenian massacres, practically without a murmur, and there is no reason why they should not similarly endure for a considerable period the more go-a-head despotism of the committee. But should the position of the latter be shaken owing to an explosion of internal disaffection or external shock, or a combination of both, we should almost certainly see a repetition of the pro-British demonstrations of 1908, somewhat embar rassing as they were. We must, however, take facts as they are, and, as far as Mesopotamia is concerned, 1 Young Turkey’s policy is to spare neither energy nor money to create a strong military force in those regions, to disarm the refractory tribes and bring them under effective control, and, in a word, to impress the Arabs and show them that the Turk is master against all comers, native or foreign. It must, too, be remembered that the present military Governor-General of Bagdad’s semi-viceregal powers run from Hekkiari in the north to Mohammerah and to El Katr in the Arabian peninsula, and the Turks have a natural desire and pretension to pose as the protectors of the weaker Asiatic Mussulman state in Persia. The committee has been compared to a steam-roller, which, in a semi-republican manner, is determined to level all privileges, starting vdth those of the palace. It has done so in Albania and Roumelia, and is now busy in Syria. It also, somewhat logically, feels a desire to apply the same levelling process to the privileged or predominant position of foreigners, e.g. t of the British in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Had they proceeded slowly and gradually their policy would have been more successful and encountered less objection and resistance. But what appears to natives and foreigners as undue haste and abruptness of method seems to be the prevailing characteristics of- *3 le nou Jegime, and the recent action of the authorities at Bagdad in the matter of the 0,1 demolitlon of Pi'emises and their intention of unnecessarily running a roac ilough the grounds of His Majesty’s consulate-general are only instances in point. • ^ cail ^ 10t liel P sympathising with the desire of a regained consciousness of national independence to assert itself, but the present mental attitude of the Young Turks is rather destructive and devoid of a feeling of give and take. Given this frame of mind it would seem only prudent of us not to remind them either in the public press or pmately °i our commercial or political predominance in Irak or the Gulf, as such asbei ions only nerve them to further attempts to diminish our prestige and undermine our predominance. ^ iie ext ernal ^ manifestations of our special position in those regions which wound t leir siisceptioihties are, apart from the general situation in the adjoining districts of +n rS pV t vr 3 Q S1 u e n° f ° U n 1 ' esl( ^ nc y buildings and grounds at Bagdad, the sepoy guaid, the R.I.M S. Comet, the British flag flown by two of Lynch’s steamers on Turkey s internal waters, the status of the Sheikh of Koweit, and his influence and position as regards the Mumtefik, Ibn Saoud, &amp;c., Bahrein, and El Katr, if not, indeed, the Irucial Coast and Muscat. ^ The sepoy guard and the “Comet,” which are the survival of a state of things vlnch is passing away in proportion as Bagdad becomes accessible to the outside world, are m a way incompatible with an effective assertion of Turkey’s territorial soveieignty, and give a certain legitimate ground for umbrage to the Turkish autlionties ; but until the new regime is able to stand alone without the prop of martial lav in the capital, if not, indeed, until the time comes to do away with the Capitula tions, it would seem premature to consider any suggestion towards abolishing them, except, perhaps, as part of a general bargain or liquidation of our position vis-d-vis of lurkey m the upper reaches of the Persian Gulf. After the revival of the constitution an attempt was made to settle the question of the British flag on Lynch’s steamers by fusing the latter with the Mehrieh Ottoman Company, ana, had Kiamil Pasha or Hilmi Pasha retained power, the scheme would doubtless have been sanctioned ; but, as will be remembered, a section of the committee took up an uncompromising attitude, the project fell through, and it only remains for the present to endeavour to protect Lynch’s acquired rights, but the possibilitv of friction ending in an anti-Lynch boycott cannot be excluded. As regards Koweit and Sheikh Mubarek’s sphere of influence, His Majesty’s Government m 1902 contended that he had always been independent, and that his father had specially stipulated such independence when he allowed Turkish troops to cross his territory during Midhat Pasha’s expeditions to El Hasa (called Nejd by the Turks). The Turks maintained that Koweit was an integral portion of the Ottoman Empire, and pointed to the Turkish flag flown there, and the grade of pasha accepted by the sheikh. To this latter argument my predecessor replied that these were merely i emblems of the sheikh’s spiritual dependence on the Caliph, and the status quo basis was agreed^ to, but the Turks interpreted it as meaning that Koweit was an integral part of their territory. In their mind England’s interference there was due to our rivalry with Germany over the terminal section of and point of the Bagdad Railway, and they expect to get the question settled favourably to their contention when final arrangements are made for the completion of that enterprise. As regards Zakhnuniyeh, El Katr, and Bahrein which in a way form one group, the active forward policy of the Young Turk Vali of Bussorah and the Mutessarif of El Hasa (Nejd) have already brought us into sharp conflict, and there seems no doubt that we should insist on Turkish exclusion from the district south of Ojair. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs, after studying the question of Zakhnuniyeh and Odied and consulting his colleagues, does not give categorical instructions for the non-interference or the Turkish local authorities, it would seem necessary, subject to the views ol His Majesty’s Government, to take a strong line. For, to the Turkish mind, Zakhnuniyeh is a sort of stepping-stone to El Katr, and perhaps even to the Trucial Coast. The Turks do not put forward any valid claims to justify their territorial acquisitions in those parts, but it is not difficult to glean that they base their claims on the fact that in the beginning of the sixteenth century a Turkish flotilla, under Piale Pasha, annexed Gwadur, in South Baluchistan, and sailed up the Gulf, compelling the Arab chiefs to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan and Caliph. They further feel that as the dominant Islamic power they have undefined right to bring under their allegiance and to protect the small Arab Moslem tribes, &amp;c., in the Arabian peninsula. This second claim is of course untenable from an international law point of view, and is a strange derogation from the much-vaunted principle of “ Ottomanism,” asopposed to Islamism, supposed to be the keystone of the new regime. The first claim is barred by the absence of effective occupation for close on three centuries, and is consequently inadmissible, as shown by the arrangements with Germany by which His Majesty’s Government acknowledged the latter’s rights in the Cameroons, South- West Africa, &amp;c. Should the present Turkish Government prove obdurate in the matters of Zakhnuniyeh and the Mudir of Odeid, it would be well, I think, to remember that in applying the methods of coercion, employed under the old regime, it was a question of bringing pressure to bear on a Sultan who did not allow such incidents to be discussed in the native press ; whereas the present rulers, who owing to youthful inexperience have perhaps less sense of caution and responsibility, may, through the native press—which is not allowed to criticise their acts—rouse public opinion by appeals to the fanaticism and ultra-national feelings of the ignorant masses, and by depicting England as aggressively hostile to Islam. I do not, however, think that we should be deterred by such methods. Young Turkey is now on fairly friendly terms with Austria, despite the amputation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while, though the Russian Embassy have been extremely complacent and apparently in relations of most intimate friendship with the leading members of the committee, the latter’s organs have not refrained from fierce attacks on Russia and her policy. Again, (lining the last nine months the blandishments showered by the French Embassy and Government on the Young Turks have not deterred them from taking up a line of sharp antagonism to French semi-official finance in the matter of a recent loan, and courting the displeasure of French Government circles by rather violent criticisms in the “Tanin,” &amp;c. . On p. 22 of the Confidential memorandum of February 1908, respecting British interests in the Persian Gulf, the Trucial Coast is said to extend to El Odeid, and the Abu Dthabi are reckoned among the Trucial chiefs, while on p. 42 Colonel Felly is quoted as having in 1872 regarded El Cdeid as properly belonging to Aber Dthabi. In 1904, after the appointment by the Turks of a mudir at A\ akra had been cancelled, the Government of India expressed forcibly their view that a treaty should be negotiated with Sheikh Ahmed, but this course was deprecated by my predecessor. Sir Y. R. O’Conor, who regarded the conclusion of the proposed treaty as then inopportune. Should His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India now decide on the expediency of making such a treaty, there would seem to me no objection from the Constantinople point of view, and the time may not be far distant when, as advocated by Lord Lansdowne in February 1905, a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, treatment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf, including the withdrawal, absolute or against some quid pro quo, of the Turkish post at El Bidaia, may become imperative, if, indeed, it is not forced upon us. In their despatch of the 21st February, 1907, the Government of India expressed the view that the chances of Turkey re-establishing her authority in Eastern Arabia to be remote, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks disappearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. The revival of the Turkish constitution in 1908 and the events of the last two years have considerably, if not profoundly, modified the situation in the near East. The Turkish revolution was not merely a change of regime and m reign, as it appeared to some, but meant the awakening of new and powerful forces on the lines of an Asiatic or Turkish revival, fl In 1903 our position in the Gulf seemed threatened by Russia, and Lord Lansdowne’s declaration in the House of Lords had in view the possible aggressive expansion of other Powers than Turkey ; but the latter is now bent on an active and forward policy there, and after the recent acquisition of money in Paris and additions to her fleet from Germany, we may soon see one or more Turkish naval units cruising in the Gulf. A ship flying the Turkish flag will certainly produce a greater effect on the Arabs than did the “ Yariag,” while the meddlesome tactlessness of Turkish naval officers and their desire to have coaling stations, &amp;c., may give rise to troublesome incidents. I was recently confidentially informed of the drift of a report on the Persian Gulf and England’s position there compiled by Mahmoud Bey, the Ottoman consul-general at Bombay, and his subordinate Jelal Bey, both of whom seem to be keen and active officials. The report sketches the way in which Great Britain has built up her influence by generous pecuniary treatment of the Arab chiefs at Muscat and elsewhere, and urges that the Ottoman Government should employ similar methods, which, it says, ought to be more successful than those of England, owing to the Islamic tie between the Arabs and the Turks. Some remarks in this despatch may sound like severe criticism of the policy of the present rulers of Turkey, and I may perhaps point out that my official and private -relations vvith. those in power are c[uite cordial, while their professions of friendship for Great Britain are frequent and, I have no doubt, genuine ; but I feel that this should not blind us to the mam trend of Young Turkey aspirations, and to the likelihood that the prosecution of their national programme will bring British and Ottoman real or fancied interests into conflict in several parts of the Arab world, and perhaps, especially, m Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Hussein Jahid Bey, deputy for Constantinople, the fidus Achates of JJjavid Bey, the Minister of Finance, and the spokesman of the committee in the Tanin, has recently told us in a couple of signed articles that Young Turkey must strain every nerve to increase her land and naval forces, and that when the Minister of War can dispose of 1,500,000 bayonets, and the Minister of Marine of a considerable naval force, Turkey’s Minister for Foreign Affairs will be considered as one of the greatest of European statesmen, and Turkey will then “wreak vengeance on those who do not now treat her with proper regard.” Some officers in high positions have been heard indulging in similar outbursts, and an aide-de-camp of the Minister of War recently declared to an Englishman here that Turkev would, if put to it, light the Islamic torch from Calcutta to Morocco. These and other such expressions of a crescentade spirit need not be taken too literally, but they cannot be entirely ignored, as they are indicative of strong undercurrents. In this connection, I have the honour to enclose copies of three articles which have recently appeared in the“Jeune Turc,” a committee-inspired paper, which like the “ Neue Freie Presse ” of Vienna, is financed and directed by Jews. The latter’s detes tation of Russia, v hich is one of the features of Young Turkey, is frequently reflected in its columns, and in one of the enclosed articles A. A. (i.e., Ahmed Agaief, a Mussulman from the Crimea) represents English statesmen as having of recent years adopted a policy inconsistent with British traditions by concluding certain ententes alluding to the Anglo-Russian entente. The articles inveigh against what they erroneously call the Triple Entente, and try to make Young Turkey incline towards the Triple Alliance. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Ordinarily, as the Government of India are aware, one of the three subsi dised vessels of His Majesty’s Navy remains in the North at this season for the protection of the pearling industry. This year I was in the hope that the pro pinquity of the vessel usually deputed to the Shatt-al-Arab for the date export Season in August or September would suffice for all purposes, and that it might not be necessary to detach another vessel from Arms Traffic duty in the South. On enquiry, however, from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, I learn that Government have decided that the deputation of one of His Majesty’s ships to the Shatt-al-Arab for the protection of British Indian sailing craft is not considered necessary this season. 4. I am already in communication with His'Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, t regarding two milder cases of piracy on Persian vessels near the Shatt-al-Arab Bar, and therefore regret from my own point of view that the decision has been taken this year ; in any case it will not now be safe in my opinion to leave the whole of the northern portion of the Gulf for the next few months without the presence of one of His Majesty’s ships, and as soon as H.

The piracy seems to have been well planned and carried out in a most thorough and cold-blooded manner for even at this date (a fortnight after the occurrence) no trace has been obtained either of the missing men or of the sus pected helium. 3. The Shaikh is still making secret enquiries on the Shatt-al-Arab and something may result therefrom in the future. In the meanwhile I would venture to suggest that the presence of a British man-of-war (if one can be spared from the Arms Traffic operations) in the river or a cruise from the pearl-banks to Kuwait and the Shatt-al-Arab would do much to allay the apprehensions caused by this incident and would probably deter other lawless spirits who, emboldened by the present success, may contemplate similar excursions. It may be men tioned in this connection that no man-of-war has visited Kuwait since the 7th October 1909 and I believe the Flag has not been shown in the river since last November. I asked Shaikh Mubarak about the piracy to-day and the following are the facts&lt; Saleh al Hajri left Kuwait in the afternoon of Tuesday the 28th June to join the pearling fleet. There were besides himself, one Baghdadi passenger which to buy pearls, 32 half-bags of rice, some bags coffee and a lot of dates, all for sale among the pearling fleet. Enclosure No. 3.

Saleh had on board some Rs. 5,000 in cash withj- J n h n E sa ™®. af * e ™ 00n a iellum from up the river also left Kuwait in the same direction. This helium was manned by Kasba and Maniauni people. It is presumed that there was collusion between the helium and the Doragh sailor with Saleh al Hajn, who knew what his master was carrying. ^ On Wednesday the 29th a Bahrain boat sighted Haiti’s boom at anchor in itVn'd f 0mS r l 0 ; t r' ater a ' d 0ff l RaS , AI ,ileiah (Q ali y ah on ™ a P). went up to it and found there was nobody on board, but there were some spent Martini bullets on the deck, a few splashes of blood, and the stripped of her con tents except a bag or two of dates and rice in the bottom. Her sailing and other gear were intact but one anchor was missing and she had a small hole stove in her bottom as a so had the jolly boat belonging to her. They took the sails and the joilly boat for identification purposes to Kuwait as they failed to clear the water out of the boom, though several efforts were made. The Shaikh then sent another boom to bring her in. On arrival in Kuwait some more bullets were found embedded in the wood work and her weather-board or gunwale on the star-board side smashed parently having been charged down by the attacking helium.

In this connection I beg to forward for the information of the Government •No. 745, dated the 20th November 1909. India a copy of a letter* from the Poli tical Agent, Bahrain, on the subject. It would appear that the assurances given by the Turkish Government regarding the evacuation of the Island are correct, and that there are no Turkish soldiers now there. 3. It will be seen that the Shaikh of Bahrain suggests that his flag should be flown at Zakhnuniya in the cold weather when the Dawasir tribe are there, but that no flag should be flown during the summer months when the Island is unin habited. On the other hand Captain Mackenzie thinks that, as no flag has been flown on the Island since the days of the Shaikh’s father, it will be rather a dis turbance of the sfatos quo to fly a flag, and that the action will increase the sus picion with which our actions on the Arab Coast are viewed by the Turks. 4. It seems to me that if a flag is to be hoisted at all it should be flown at intervals all the year round, and not only for a few months in the year. 5. I therefore propose, should the Government of India see no objection, to request the Shaikh to hoist his flag and maintain a Dawasir custodian who will remain on the Island during the hot weather. No. 745, dated the 20th November 1909. From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—M ajor A. P. Trevor, I. A., First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, Persian Gulf. With reference to this office diary entry No. 122, dated the 30th April 1909, I have the honour to inform you that some days after Major Prideaux left Zakh nuniya, four Turkish soldiers were sent to reside in the fort there and guard it. They stayed a few days and built a small house, and repaired the platform of the flagstaff, and then returned to Ojair, taking the flagstaff with them. About three weeks ago some fifteen men of the Dawasir tribe went to Zakhnuniya and it is reported that the Island is clear of soldiers. As the Island is uninhabited during the summer months, it is difficult to obtain reliable information as to whether the Turks visited the island from time to time, but it is reported by the Dawasir that there were a few soldiers tb ere when they first arrived but that they left shortly after. They also stated that they have been told by the soldiers of the Ojair garrison that it is the intention of the Turkish officials to send over men shortly to repair the fort which is now a ruin. It seems probable that these actions are due to the changes of Mutasarrifs of Hasa, and of Walis of Busrah. I have warned the head of the tribe not to permit any imbroglio with the Turks. 2. I mentioned to Shaikh Esa the question of flying bis flag in the island. He said that he would like it flown while the Dawasir remained there during the win ter, but that it should be withdrawn in summer on their return. 3. My personal opinion on the flag question is that if we are going to adhere to the status quo ante, the flag should not be flown as Sheikh Esa told me he did not think that the flag had been flown since the time of his father. Provided the Turks are not allowed to go there, and the Dawasir continue to go every winter the pre scriptive right to the island is strengthened without the question of the flag being raised. Again if any insult to the flag takes place it may force our hand into severe measures than it may be politic to take. The hoisting of the flag there would moreover tend to increase the suspicion and distrust with which our actions in these parts are viewed by the Turks.Sir G.

Bahrein, In March last Mudir of Ojair visited island of Zakhnuniyah and ran up Turkish flag on ruined fort on the island. Zakhnuniyah is small island 10 miles south of Ojair, has no permanent inhabitants, but is frequented in winter by Bahrein Dowasir and claimed by Sheikh of Bahrein. Prideaux, who visited island on 18th March, found Turkish flag attached to a mast on the fort. He was informed by Dowasir that Mudir had enquired whether they were coming under Turkish rule. I hey replied in negative, and refused to comply with Mudir’s request to run up and lower Turkish flag daily. Cox telegraphs, 6th May, that tower on the Island has now been repaired by Turks who have arranged to keep guard of 20 men there relieving them from Ojair daily. Sheik of Bahrein desires to protest against Turkish occupation. He says that fort was built by his father, Sheikh All, with concurrence of h^ejd Amir, and that he used to keep garrison on the island. e consider that claim of Sheikh should be supported. His Majesty's Government have never recognised Ottoman jurisdiction as extending south of Ojair. We recommend that Porte be informed that island belongs to Bahrein, and they be pressed to issue orders to Mudir to remove garrison posted on the island. Cox also recommends, and we agree, that Sheikh of Bahrein be advised to fly his flag there. Copies of correspondence were despatched by mail of 20th. Foreign Secret. Zakhnuniyah Island. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople instructed 30th May to bring facts to the notice of Porte, and to ask them to send orders for the withdrawal of the garrison on the ground of avoiding any disturbance of the status quo. It seemed desirable not to raise question of our protectorate over Bahrein in the first instance. As to proposed advice to Sheikh to fly his own flag, result of our representations can be awaited before deciding on any line of action.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. The correspondence ending with my letter No. 626, dated 7th March 1909, treated of the inclination of the Turkish authorities to repeat their former attempts at interference at Wakra on the Katar Coast. 2 . In the communication of which I now have the honour to submit a copy, Major Prideaux, while relating in one portion of it what passed in the above connection at a visit which he has recently paid to Sheikh Jasim bin Thani at Lusail, also reports the circumstances under which the Mudir of Ojair has endeavoured to assert Turkish jurisdiction on the Island of Zaknuniyeh. It is in the latter connection that I make the present reference. 3. Hitherto, ue have set our faces against any sort of recognition or tolera tion of Turkish jurisdiction south of Ojair. (I beg that it may be particularly noted at this point that the correct position of Ojair is as shown in Admiralty Chart No. 2837-3.“ Persian Gulf general, Sheet II M , and not at the head of Salwa Bay as indicated in certain official works and published atlases. It will be seen from the Chart referred to that Zaknuniyeh is some 10 miles south of Ojair). 4. The Bahreini Dowasir who frequent the island in the winter having returned to Bahrein, it will remain uninhabited during the coming hot weather months; it seems therefore unnecessary for me to move Government by telegraph, but I trust that the Sheikh of Bahrein’s claim will be upheld, and the Porte notified that the island belongs to that Sheikh and that we are prepared to maintain his rights over it. I would also suggest that Sheikh Esa be advised to fly his flag there during the winter and to employ a regular custodian to take charge of it from among those of his Dowasir subjects, who annually migrate there. No. 207 , dated Bahrein, the 4 th April 1909 . From—M ajor F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report that the Turkish Officials in Hasa, under their present Mutasarrif, Mahir Pasha, are apparently making some effort to establish their authority more securely in the rather vaguely defined district over which they rule. 2. During the last week of February 1909, I heard that the Mudir of Ojair had been corresponding with the Dowasir tribesmen who periodically visit Zakhnuniya Island from Bahrein, with a view to getting them to admit their allegiance to the Turkish throne. A week or two later the rumour reached BalTrein that a Turkish salaried Kaimmakam had been despatched to Doha to take over the Government of the town (or whole Katar Peninsula, perhaps, as the Turks claim it) from Sheikh Jasim bin Thani and his deputy son, Abdallah bin Jasim. 3. On the 8th March, I proceeded to Lusail, Sheikh Jasim’s headquarters, in the Agency launch, and on the 10th the old Chief rode in from the interior to meet me. I also despatched a confidential reporter, who had accompanied me from Bahrein, by name Yusuf bin Ahmad Kano, overland to Doha to collect all the authentic news possible connected with the object of my visit.4 . Sheikh Jasim received me very cordially, and appeared to be enjoying better health than I had ever seen him in before. He scoffed at the notion that there had been any recent ilhfeeling between ^ the Turks and himself, and declared that, in the matter of the A1 bu Ainain dis affection at Wakra, the Government had supported him quite as much as he could wish. The new official who had come to the fort at Bida’ was, he said, connect ed with the troops, and though he had tried occasionally to give advice to Sheikh Abdallah (Jasim’s son), the latter had resolutely ignored him. When I observed that 1 had heard that the Turks were talking of assuming the adminis tration of the Customs, Sheikh Jasim said the revenue from this source was insignificant, being only about Rs. 400 monthly, and barely sufficient to defray the cost of the Bazar watchmen. To please the British Government he had introduced a heavy tax * to kill the trade in slaves and arms, but provisions and * C.f. Persian Gulf Residency Diary Entry No. Other necessities Were Still admitted free. 1340, for week endingytH July igoy. The latter part of this statement I am quite sure is not true, though the Sheikh went to the length of calling in my pilot, a Katar Nakhoda, to confirm what he said, and the man actually did so until we had left the Sheikh’s presence l My messenger into Doha reported on his return that the Turkish official about whom we had been uneasy was ostensibly a Kazi, such as was attached to the Government Staff in Hofuf and Katif, and that his post in Doha would be quite a sinecure as no Arabs would ever go near him. We found on our return to Bahrein that this worthy had personally hurried off to Hasa vtd Bahrein to report the news of my visit the instant he heard of it in Doha. 5. On the 17th March, I left Bahrein again in the steam launch to visit Zakhnuniya Island which is situated close to the mainland about 10 miles south of Ojair. The most recent news about this place had been that the Mudir of Ojair had just visited the island, taking two or three military officers with him and a Turkish flag, and that he had asked the Dowasir, whom he met there, whether they had settled anything with their headman in Bahrein about coming under Turkish rule. The tribesmen replied that they had decided not to accept his (the Mudir’s) advice, as they might then perhaps lose their possession in Bahrein. The Mudir afterwards proceeded to the ruined fort on the west side of the island, and ran up the flag. He then told the Dowasir, that he did not a.k of them anything, except to run up and lower the flag every day at sunrise and sunset, and, when they all left the island, to return it to him in Ojair. The Dowasir declined to comply with this request, and most of them returned to Bahrein soon after the Mudir’s departure. 6. I landed on Zakhnuniya on the 18th March, and found that there was only one boat of fishermen on k the beach. The men, Bahrein subjects, were living in two or three temporary mat huts at the southern extremity of the island and were engaged in fishing for sharks, swordfish, etc. The dilapidated fort on the west side of the island was uninhabited, but 1 noticed that a Turkish flag was rolled up and attached to the bottom end of the halyard and fastened tight to the mast. The island is absolutely devoid of trees and brackish water is only obtainable in small quantities from shallow pits in the hollows of the sand mounds. 7. From Zakhnuniya I proceeded straight across the Bay of Bahrein to Hawar Island, were the Dowasir have two similar winter villages. Here I found in one locality a collection of 40 large huts under the authority of a cousin of the tribal principal Sheikh. This individual, Esa bin Ahmad Dosin', is also related by marriage to Sheikh Esa bin Ali, and he told me that he had at first thought that the launch was a Turkish gunboat, a visit from which they quite expected to receive. He also told me that Zakhnuniya was undoubtedly a possession of the Chief of Bahrein, but that the Dowasir regarded Hawar as their own independent territory, the ownership of this island having been awarded to the tribe by the Kazi of Zubara more than loo years ago, in a written decision ’which they still preserve,The contesting tribe named A 1 bu Toba is now apparently extinct, but as • the Kazi of Zubara was in those days an official of the A 1 Khalifa, the island _ would seem to be a dependency of the mainland State, which the Chief of Bahrein still claims as morally and theoretically his. 8. On my return to Bahrein, I informed Sheikh Esa as soon as possible of the result of my trip, and he at once said that he desired to make a written protest on the subject of the Turkish occupation of Zakhnuniya. He remarked that his father Sheikh Ali had built the fort, with the concurrence of the Nejd Amir, Bin Saud (who then ruled the adjacent mainland), for the protection of his central possessions, and that for some years he had kept a garrison on the island. When the necessity for this had ceased he had withdrawn his men, but at a later date one of the Chief Dowasir had repaired the fort with his, Sheikh Esa s, permission for a residence. The island was an unproductive possession, \ and, on account of the blood feud with the A 1 Morra, it was not very safe now to live on, but at the same time the Sheikh objected strongly, to the Turks annexing the place. Another possession, outside of the Bahrein Islands, which the Chief holds and from which he derives several hundred krans in revenue each year, is the reef situated about 7 miles from Budaiya (North-west town of Bahrein), which is actually on the west or mainland side of the deep water channel from Katif to Ojair. This reef, named Labaina, includes the two islets (2 feet high), marked on the Admiralty Chart “ 0 . I. Bahrein to Ojair ” which are respectively known as Lubainat al Aliya and Laba inat as Safliya . The Sheikh takes a tax from all the boats wticn collect turtle sliell on these islets, and if the Turks maintain their right to Zakhnuniya, they may soon see fit to claim the two northern islets, as they claimed the Nazwa Sand-bank near Katif in March 1907. 9. I enclose a translation of Sheikh Esa’s formal letter of protest, and venture strongly to recommend that favourable consideration be given to it.

Also the island of Zakhnuniya off the western coast, near Ojair is under my jurisdiction of Bahrein, and my subjects are (periodically) residing there in order to hunt in the sea.

Bahrein, In March last Mudir of Ojair visited island of Zakhnuniyah and ran up Turkish flag on ruined fort on the island. Zakhnuniyah is small island 10 miles south of Ojair, has no permanent inhabitants, but is frequented in winter by Bahrein Dowasir and claimed by Sheikh of Bahrein. Prideaux, who visited island on 18th March, found lurkish flag attached to a mast on the fort. He was informed by Dowasir that Mudir had enquired whether they were coming under Turkish rule. I hey replied in negative, and refused to comply with Mudir’s request to run up and lower Turkish flag daily. Cox telegraphs, 6th May, that tower on the Island has now been repaired by lurks who have arranged to keep guard of 20 men there relieving them from Ojair daily. Sheik of Bahrein desires to protest against Turkish occupation. He^ says that fort was built by his father, Sheikh Ali, with concurrence of Nejd Amir, and that he used to keep garrison on the island. We consider that claim of Sheikh should be supported. His Majesty’s Government have never recognised Ottoman jurisdiction as extending south of Ojair. We recommend that Porte be informed that island belongs to Bahrein, and they be pressed to issue orders to Mudir to remove garrison posted on the island. Cox also recommends, and we agree, that Sheikh of Bahrein be advised to fly his flag there.

Besides these few remarks which I have made bold to lay before your Lordship, 1 beg leave to say that I find some difficulty in clearly understanding the policy propose by the Government of India in regard to El Odeid. On the one hand, it is suggested that our warning to the Porte should he based on the fact that we consider El Odeid a£ an appanage of the Chief of Abu Dhabi, an independent Ruler with whom we have Treaty relations—that is to say, that we consider El Odeid as independent of the Chief of Katr; while, on the other hand, we appear to be contemplating the contingency of counteracting Turkish designs in El Katr by countenancing the absorption of El Odeid by Ahmed-bin-Thani. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Blech. THE Turks claim the Katr coast as part of the Nejd, to which in 1871 they sent a military expedition to assimilate it to the other provinces of the Empire. We have never admitted the validity of this claim, and we have treated misbehaviour on the part of the local Chiefs without much regard to Turkish pretensions, though the Turks have, at the invitation or with the connivance of those Chiefs, established small militavy posts at Ojeir, Zobara, and El Bidaa. It does not appear that any remon strance was addressed to the Turkish Government against the establishment of the post at El Bidaa, the date of which is not mentioned, hut to which Colonel Talbot alludes in his No. 76 of the 7th May, 1893, as having existed, though unrecognized, for twenty years or so. In 1881 British naval officers were instructed not to allow themselves for the future to he too much hampered by the 3-mile limit in pursuing and capturing pirates, especially as the Turkish authority on the coast is at many points of a very shadowy description. The Porte was informed that as our remonstrances against unrestrained piracy in Turkish waters had produced no result, the British naval officers in the Persian Gulf would be authorized, when necessary, to take such measures as they may think fit for the protection of British commerce without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial jurisdiction in those waters. In reply to a complaint respecting the action of British Consular authorities in regard to the Chief of El Bidaa, Lord Granville stated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 7th May, 1883 : “ I beg leave to remind your Excellency that the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Katr coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Government.” In 1889 Her Majesty’s Embassy represented to the then Grand Vizier the various considerations which made it very desirable for the Turkish Government not to extend its military action south of Katif. Whether in respect of these considerations or for other reasons the Turks apparently took no action. Under instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, Her Majesty’s Embassy asked the Sublime Porte to inform it as to the truth of a report which had reached Her Majesty’s Government, to the effect that the Imperial Ottoman Government intend to establish posts at Zobara and Odeid on the Katr coast, and that Mudirs have been appointed thereto. No reply having been received, a further inquiry is made. Her Majesty’s Government coidd not acquiesce in the occupation by Turkey ol a port which is regarded by them as a dependency of Ahou Dthabi, the Chief of which is one of the parties to the Maritime Truce. Zohara and Odeid are within the Vilayet of Bussorah, and have long since been administered by Kaimakams and Mudirs. The Imperial Government has no knowledge of the Maritime Truce, and cannot recognize it. Transmits a copy of the Maritime Truce, signed by the Chiefs of Raz-ul-Khaima, Abou Hthabi, Debay, Ejman, and Umalgawin. Odeid being a dependency of Abou Dthabi, the Chief of which is a party to the Maritime Truce, Her Majesty’s Govern ment cannot acquiesce in a Turkish occupation of that port.\ 3 'Lti-J Zobara and Odeid are in the Yilayet of Bussorah, and long administered by Kaimakams and Mndirs. The British Besident could not be ignorant of the fact that the sovereignty of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan extended over the countries in question, and he should have abstained from exercising the r61e of mediator between th rab Sheikhs without the previous assent of the Porte. In any case, the Ottoman Government having been left in ignorance of this act, it can have no influence on its sovereign rights. Moreover, it is merely an armistice between Sheikhs, and could in no case be invoked against the establishment of Turkish military posts at Zobara and Odeid. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reports that there are no Turkish troops at Zobara, and that Odeid is unoccupied. Reports are prevalent that the Turks intend to send troops to Katr to attack Jasim. The Resident suggests that he would be justified in preventing the Turks from occupying either Zobara or Odeid, and compelling their evacuation if suddenly seized. He has been instructed m reply by Lord Lansdowne to report any movements of the Turks on Zobara or Odeid, but to take no measures of forcible opposition without orders. In 1893 the question of the Katr coast came to the fore, and the Porte informed Sir C. Ford that the Sultan contemplated sending troops to the Katr coast as a dependency of the Nejd. His Majesty’s Government instructed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to proceed in a ship of war to inquire into the disturbance. The Turkish Government deprecated the dispatch of a British ship, and stated that the place formed an integral part of the Ottoman dominions ; a telegram was communicated by them from the Governor and inhabitants of Katr, acknowledging the Sultan’s sovereignty. Colonel Talbot, who did proceed to El Bidaa, recommended that an effort should be made to procure the withdrawal of the Turks from the Katr peninsula. A proposal was made to negotiate with the Sultan to resign his supposed rights over the Katr peninsula to Jasim and Ahmed his brother, but Lord Rosebery thought that nothing would come of it. Lord Kimberley subsequently proposed that Her Majesty’s Government should continue the policy laid down in 1883 of denying Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr. Lord Rosebery assented, but did not think it necessary to make any official communi cation on the subject to the Turkish Government unless they raised the question officially. Rustem Pasha was reminded unofficially of Lord Granville’s Declaration of the 7th May, 1883. (See above. Minute on India Office 10th August, 1893, in Confidential Paper 6410.) The Government of India have directed that the Commandant and Senior Naval Officer may be informed that His Majesty’s ships are not to recognize Turkish rule at El Bidap, but that British Naval officers should avoid giving Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting by overt action such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in that locality, and to this end His Majesty’s ships should refrain from visiting the harbour of El Bidaa except when special occasion for doing so arises. The India Office drew attention to the discrepancy in the suggestion contained in the Foreign Office letter to the India Office of the 26th August, 1893, of recognizing the nominal suzerainty of the Porte at El Bidaa so long as the Turkish authorities do not move bevond the limits of the town. It was pointed out that this was incom patible with the instructions of the Government of India that Her Majesty’s ships should not recognize Turkish rule at El Bidaa. In reply, the Foreign Office concurred in the instruction to the Naval Commander. A complaint being made by the “Nakhoda” (master) of a British boat against the Turkish Commander at El Bidaa, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to take no further action in the matter, as the result of pursuing it further would probably have been to elicit from the Commandant’s superiors an assertion of the Porte’s jurisdiction at El Bidaa.

Sir: - ,/ With reference to recent correspondence, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying draft of a despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople respecting the vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey and the number of incidents of political aggression which have recently marked the conduct of the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf. j 4 Sir E. Grey would be glad to be furnished with the observations of Viscount Morley respecting the terms of this despatch. t Sir E. Grey is of opinion that, although the in cident respecting the alleged intention of the Vali of Bagdad to interfere with the grounds of His Majesty's Consulate-General is closed, it would be better not to allow the matter to pass without some comment(32854/10) 15'S' comment, as it may 'be reopened, at any time. h. With regard to the appointment of a Turkish Mudir at El Odeid, Sir E. Grey considers that refer ence to this subject might perhaps be omitted, if the enquiries which have been instituted locally show that the official in question has not proceeded to El Odeid; on the other hand, it might be expedient to comnunicate to the Ottoman Government a clear statement of the claims of His Majesty's Government on the subject. ^ In this connexion, I am to draw your attention to a statement made by Sir G. Lowther in his despatch No.603 of the 22nd August (of which a copy has already been sent to your Department) that there now appears to be no longer any objection to the conclusion of a treaty, as desired by the Government of India in 1904, with a Sheikh of the El Katr Peninsula, and I am to request that Sir E. Grey may be furnished with Lord Morley's views on the subject. / It will be observed that Sir G. Lowther further raises( 32854 / 10 ) 15 6 raises the point as to whether the withdrawal of the Turkish post at El Bidaa should he insisted upon, '‘7, Sir E.

Should it he necessary to use force at those places, then the ques tion of El Bidaa might he reconsidered. £ With regurd to the difficulty which has arisen in relation to the Sheikh of Koweit’s Fedaghia prop erty, I am to suggest that, if the enquiries which are now being made should show that that difficulty has disappeared with the recall of the late Vali of Bussorah, it might he prudent to omit all reference to this question. I am. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,CONFIDENTIAL. \5~t DRAFT. Sir G. Lowther. No. &gt;. v [32854] Foreign Office, Sir &gt; October , 1910. I HATE received your Excellency’s despatch 3^10 (J No. 603 of the 22nd August and other reports, in which you enumerate repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey, and, further, draw my attention to the number of incidents of political aggression, all tending to a disturbance of the status quo, which have recently marked the conduct of the Ottoman authorities in the region of the Persian Gulf. These occurrences, which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced, in their cumulative effect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of the local Ottoman authorities,— an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. I therefore have decided to in struct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order that his Excellency may be fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint: in taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty’s Government have decided to make friendly repre sentations, believing that the Ottoman Govern ment will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of nourse arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policyj It will be convenient to deal first with the injustice to which British commercial interests have been subjected. In July the representative of Messrs. Lynch and Co. at Bagdad was informed that certain property of his firm would, under a municipal [740] B 1regulation, be demolished as insecure and dangerous. The British Consul-General found that the property, which he took an early oppor tunity of inspecting, was perfectly safe. A few days later a notification was made to Messrs. Abdul Ali, a British - Indian firm, respecting the projected demolition, on similar grounds, of their principal shop and the arbitrary expropriation of the site, wdiich is a valuable one. This property was likewise found, on inspection, to be in excellent condition and in no wise dangerous. The British Consul-General hereupon visited the President of the Municipality and protested vigorously against the wanton destruction of property on a false pretext of danger to the public : The President agreed that the pretext was really false, but he regretted that he had no power to stay the operations which were being carried through with a high hand by a member of the military staff of the A' ali, who was set upon certain schemes of municipal .improvementj The conclusion drawn by His Majesty’s Consul- General was that, in the absence of funds to meet the cost of legal expropriation, the procedure complained of had been adopted. Notwithstanding that your Excellency had in the meantime made urgent representations through the Minister of the Interior, an extensive demolition of Messrs. Lynch’s property, including their chief office, was begun on the 7th August, and more recently His Majesty’s Consul-General has reported that the property of British subjects already demolished and threatened means a loss of some £ T. 5,000; while he learns that it is proposed to enforce further expropriations, at great loss to many British subjects resident in Bagdad. His Majesty’s Government must emphatically protest against this procedure ; they must further, in view of the fact that it has originated with the Vali, hold the Ottoman Government themselves responsible for the damage already inflicted, and, after receiving a report as to its precise extent from His Majesty’s Consul-General, your Excel lency should present a detailed claim to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before leaving the question of these expropria tions, I think it necessary to advert to the rumoured intention of the Vali of Bagdad to cause a new road to be constructed throughthe middle of the grounds of His Majesty’s Consulate-General, whereas by making a slight deviation it might be made to follow an existing road : it is true that after your Excellency had made representations to the Sublime Porte, the Mali asserted to His Majesty’s Consul-General that no interference with the Consulate buildings had been in contemplation: 1 feel constrained to .observe that the local evidence to the contrary effect is of a conclusive character. Two further cases of unwarrantable inter ference with British interests have also recently occurred at Bagdad :— In the first of these cases Messrs. Abdul Ali, the British-Indian firm already referred to, were suddenly ordered to sell the ice manufactured by them at a reduced rate of 10 paras a kilogramme instead of 20 paras an oke, their usual -charge: I understand that owing to non-compliance with this arbitrary order the local authorities have threatened to close by force two ice factories belonging to British Indian subjects. In the second case two British firms, Messrs. Blockey Cree and Co. and Messrs. Blaney and Solomon, were informed that they must transfer their factories to the outskirts of the town, on the pretext of a regulation 46 years old concerning steam-engines and boilers, whereas, as your Excellency has pointed out to me, the factories in question are run by smokeless oil-engines, which are in no respect dangerous. There is clearly, therefore, no ground whatever for the application of the regulation to these factories, and its enforcement would be wholly unreasonable and very burdensome to the owners. Your Excellency should insist upon satisfaction being accorded to each of these British firms and afford to them the full and effectual pro tection of His Majesty’s Government, who cannot admit a continuance of the oppression to which they are being subjected. I have already furnished your Excellency with full instructions on the subject of the forcible and unjust intervention of the Ministry of Public Works in the dispute which has arisen between the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company and the Societe des Quais : it is matter for grave concern to His Majesty’s Government that, apart from this particular incident, the Board of this Com pany should be compelled to complain that “ for 'the past two years the attitude of the Ministry of4 • Commerce and Public Works has been increas ingly overbearing and harassing,” and that they should have claimed the active protection of His Majesty’s Government “not only on account of the important material interests involved in the present case, but also in view of the systematic and continuous attempts which are now being made to encroach on the Company’s rights and privileges as laid down in its Conventions with the Imperial Ottoman Government.” I pass now to the incidents of political a ession. s Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, in a telegram dated the Gth August, reported that the Yali, Suleiman Nazif Bey, had appointed a mudir at El Odeid, which is within the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dthabi, one of the Trucial Chiefs who, for a great number of years, have been under the protection of the British Government.r] I do not propose to enter upon a detailed review of British relations with the Trucial concerns the Ottoman Government: I need simply observe that those relations have been the foundation of the maritime peace which has now been maintained in the Persian Gulf for well- nigh a century ; I and that, according to a treaty stipulation, the Chiefs are bound “ not to consent to the residence in their territories of the agent, of any other Government without the assent of the British Government.”'] As your Excellency is aware, on the 10th December, 1871, the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave an assurance that his^ Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople. Moreover, an authoritative writer has stated that the native annals of the province of Oman incontestably prove that that province, as well as f the Arab Chiefdoms of the Persian Gulf, became independent of the Bagdad Khalifate in the But apart altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred,, Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under Turkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. Chiefs, since the matter is one which in no wise'_Ihus on the 7th May, 1883, Lord Granville wrote to Musurus Pasha, then Ottoman Ambassa dor in London, that “ the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the El Katr coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Govern ment, and again, in a note verbale of the 12th August, 1895, Her Majesty’s Government stated that fhey did not recognise Turkish jurisdiction on the El Katr coast.” El Odeid being separated from Ujair by the LI Katr Peninsula, there can be no question v hatever as to the nature of the claim apparently made by Turkey to the former place. lour Excellency should point out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Go\eminent regard the appointment of a Turkish mudir at El Odeid as an act amounting to terri torial encroachment, and that they request the Ottoman Government to rescind the appointment foithwithn On the 30th May, 1909, I informed your Excellency that the Turks had some time previously occupied the island of Zakhnuniyeh, which lies some 10 miles south-east of Ujair ; that they had hoisted the Turkish flag on a fort, and had arranged to keep a guard there; that the Sheikh of Bahrein had protested to His Majesty’s Government against this occupation, his father having built the fort, where he used to keep a garrison, fifty years ago; and that the island, which had no permanent inhabitants, had been regularly isited for purposes of fishing, by natives of Bahrein.^In these circumstances your Excel lency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status quo ; and your representations were to be based not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south-east of Ujair, the furthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction. Although the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed your Excellency that the garrison had been withdrawn in June 1909, it has since been reinstated in the island, and, according to the latest reports, has quite recently been reinforced : and the Ottoman authorities in regard to this question seem set upon dis regarding your Excellency’s repeated representa tions on the subject. I have accordingly to instruct your Excellency [740] C6 to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison,jand to add that, should the matter not receive a satisfactory settlement at an early date, His Majesty’s Government must take steps to assert and maintain the rights of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island in questionn The next point upon which I desire to address your Excellency is the treatment to which the Sheikh of Koweit has been subjected by Suleiman Nazif Bey, the£V ali of Bussorah, with regard to the property which he purchased, in the course of last year, from Ahmed Pasha-el-Zoheir at a price of £ T. 48,000 which was duly paid down. When, however, Sheikh Mubarek took steps,to register the transfer at the Turkish Land Office he was informed that he must register himself as a Turkish subject : such a demand in reference to a transfer of land had never before been made. Your Excellency should inform, the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Govern ment regard the conduct of the/Vali in this matter as an attempt to modify the status quo with regard to Koweit, which is the basis of the understanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government in this important question. It appears, moreover, from reliable and circum stantial reports, that the(Vali tried by tortuous methods to instigate the vendor of the Fedaghia property to impugn Sheikh Mubarek’s title. The vendor remonstrated with the Vali, pointing out the absurdity of repudiating the sale in the face of the title-deeds, held by the Sheikh, which, besides the signature of the vendor, bore those of all the Bussorah notables as well as that of the British consul. t His Majesty’s Government rely upon the Ottoman Government to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the registration of this property; they have no wish to raise difficulties with regard to the past conduct of an official who has since been recalled ; but I must add that the incident is vexatious, and serves to deepen the impression entertained by His Majesty’s Government of ill-will on the part of Turkey.^ In his recent dealings with the Sheikh of Mohammerah the conduct of Suleiman Nazif Bey has been in the highest degree violent, vindictive, and unjust. * 6 . UIt is known to His Majesty’s Government from reports received from His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorali that there were no disturbances of importance on the Shat-el-Arab during last winter, that the Sheikh recently exercised his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between the Vali and an important Arab chief of Turkish nationality, and that the Sheikh has, in fact, carried his conciliatory attitude towards Nazif Bey so far as to acquiesce without complaint in the destruction of houses belonging to him at Bussorah. It is further known through His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah that Sheikh Khazal has endeavoured to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Such was the situation at the end of March last when the Sheikh and the Vali appeared still to be on the best of terms. Shortly afterwards, however, the Vali brought against the Sheikh certain accusations into the nature of which it is unnecessary to enter in detail, since your Excellency is already familiar with it from the correspondence which has passed on the subject. No serious proof of the truth of these accusations was ever offered, nor was any opportunity ever given to the Sheikh to disprove the charges brought against him, which he was perfectly able and willing to do. On the contrary, the Vali totally ignored a friendly and conciliatory letter addressed to him by the Sheikh, expressing the intention of proceeding to Bussorah to discuss the matters in dispute, and, further, on the Sheikh’s arrival there on the 18th April, most unjustifiably and discourteously refused to receive him at all. The Sheikh had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah. On the 24th April the Vali issued circular instructions to the local officials under his jurisdiction summarily to remove all headmen dependent on the Sheikh, and on the 25th April, during the latter’s absence at Ahwaz, the Turkish gun-boat “Marmaris,” acting on the orders of Nazif Bey, shelled the village of Zain belonging to the Sheikh, which was afterwards looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers. In the course of this attack the house of the Sheikh’s mother was burnt, and one of his wives died from shock caused by the bombardment. On the 26th April the Vali, in two official letters addressed to the Persian Consul at Bussorali, went [740] D8 so far as to threaten action against Mohammerah itself in the event of failure to comply with his demands. In spite of the injury and provocation which he had received, Sheikh Khazal continued to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government by maintaining a conciliatory attitude, by restrain ing his agents and supporters from any aggressive action, and by adopting their suggestions with respect to the wording of his communications with the Vali. The latter, on the contrary, dis played strong resentment at the attempts made by His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, under instruc tions from His Majesty’s Government, to promote an understanding between him and the Sheikh. Nazif Bey, it is true, finally accepted Sheikh Khazal’s explanations and agreed to consider the incident closed, but he unconditionally refused to express regret for the death of the Sheikh’s wife and the destruction of his mother’s house, or to pay any compensation for the losses suffered by the Sheikh in consequence of the unjustifiable bombardment of Zain. Further, at the very moment when he was considering the Sheikh’s explanations with which he owned himself satisfied, his agents were occupied in subjecting the Sheikh to further petty annoyances in the matter of the renewal, contrary to the Vali’s promise, of the lawsuit against the servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s agent at Bussorah, of the unjustified destruction, for the third time since the dispute between the Sheikh and the Vali began, of the former’s house property on the Ashar Creek and of the raid on Mirza Hamza’s house and the seizure of his property, on the ground that he had disregarded a summons for debt which had been issued against him. There can be little doubt that Kazif Bey was the real instigator of these vexatious proceedings. A further injustice to the Sheikh has now beeii committed by the decree recently issued by the Sublime Porte forbidding the registration of land in the vilayet of Bussorah in the name of the Sheikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be actually contrary to Ottoman law. Your Excellency should bring these facts to the notice of the Turkish Government, and inform them that His Majesty’s Government are bound, by agreement with the Sheikh, to use their good offices on his behalf in the event of a dispute with a foreign Power, that they have most carefully</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000037_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/162</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000037</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/162</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 757/1909 'Persian Gulf:- Turkey and Turkish aggression (Occupation of Zakhnuniyeh Island.
