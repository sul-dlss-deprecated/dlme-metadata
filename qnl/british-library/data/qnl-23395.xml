The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Sulf, Bushire Memorandum I have received a bill for £21-9-0 from Messrs. F.P.Raker and Co., Ltd., London, on account of a Shield supplied to the order of Colonel Loch in March 1937. This Shield was presented by the Political Agent to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain as a Musketry Chal lenge Shield for competition amongst the State Police. 2. I find from the file that Colonel Loch intended to meet the cost of this Shield from the Agency Private Fund, and this to my mind is far from proper. If the Shield was presented by the Political Agent it should be paid for from the Toshekhana FundjS, as would happen in any similar case in India. Unfortunately the allotment for the Bahrain Agency Toshakhana Orant has already been ex ceeded this year, and I an, therefore, unable to meet this bill. I would request that if possible a sum equivalent to £21-9-0 may be transferred from the Residency Toshakhana Grant to this Agency in order to enable me to pay the bill. 3.
