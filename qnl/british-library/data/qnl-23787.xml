I took up appointment as Ravildar in the Bahrain State Police Force and arrived at Bahrain on the 9th duly 1937# As I was on probation for six months 1 did not apply for the transfer of my pension papers to Bahrain before my confirmation# I therefore applied for the transfer of my pension papers in February 1338* i.e. after my confirmation in the above Force. I received my : P pension Certificate in May 1938. This is the only reasonfor my not being able to drav* the pensibn for the period for which I claM. I am due Rs# 192 for the period from 1st Appil 1938 to the 31st July 1938. #Statement of Havildar Abdul Karim recorded on the 9th August 1938.

It know Havlldar Mirza Jan who is also in the service of the Bahrain State. 1 know him from India as wc were in the same group (10/10 Baluch Begiraent T *B.) • To my knowledge he could not draw his pension for more than a year because he did not aprly for the transfer of his pension paners to Bahrain before his confirmation in the Bahrain State Police Force and when he applied there was some delay in the transfer of his pension papers which he received in ?' ? ay. The statement by Mirza Jan is correct and he is the real person who pap graphed S atement of Naik Piran Bitta recorded on the 9th August 1938. I am a retired L/H of the British Indian Army* At present I sm a Naik in the Bahrain State Police Force. I know Havildar Mirza Jan who is also serving in the Bahrain Police Force.
