Lorimer replied that the marriage certificate may be registered at the Agency, citing a previous marriage in 1909 as a precedent. He did, however, state that the Agency would take no responsibility for the consequences of the legality of the marriage being challenged (folio 3).Lorimer wrote to the Political Resident (Colonel Percy Cox), asking for further guidance on the legal status of the couple, and whether their status as Christians afforded them protection from the British Government (folios 7-8). Cox replied that the Political Agent’s notarial functions were being considered by Government, and that the couple’s conversion to Christianity should not relieve them of their obligation as subjects of Bahrain (folios 10-11). Cox referred the matter to the Government of India for further clarification (folios 13-14).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e7#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
