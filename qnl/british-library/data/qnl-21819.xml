Reference to previous correspondence :Summary of decisions for an Emergency Medical Aid Scheme formulated by the European Doctors of Bahrain Island on October 21st and 22nd 1940» Main Principles of Scheme &gt; 1* Centralisation of all medical units in Manama to operate from one base hospital was passed as being more beneficial, than in having two emergency units working in two hospitals. 2. The Mission and Government Hospitals would be alternatively used,-according to the number of empty beds available, and other factors. A skeleton staff would remain on duty at the second hospital to deal with any casualties who might inadvertently arrive there. 3. During an Air-Raid the following two parties would come into action (a) An outgoing Group to bring in casualties. Dr.Me Dowall, Dr. Earny, and Dr. Holmes, each equipped with two dressers would be the personnel, Br« Holmes being in charge. Suitable transport would be supplied, containing medical necessities and Stretchers. (b) A Base Group to receive the casualties. Dr. Storm and Dr. Snow would control this with their respective House Surgeons and Staffs to form one surgical team to operate in that hospital chosen for theweek. 4. Casualties . Dr* Kennedy who will be controlling the Awali area, agreed that all English cases as far as possible should be .sent to his hospital, and all Arab ones should be transported to Manama. Essential Requests Proposed . 1. A sum of money under special budget for extra equipment. This has been granted. 2. A minimum of 2 police at each hospital who would sleep there, and accompany the outgoing group in the double capacity of police and stretcher - bearers. Mr. Belgrave has kindly consented to a minimum of 2 police for each hospital, and possibly more, who will proceed to each hospital after the alarm. 3. All telephones and electric lighting to be left open always for the hospitals. This has been agteed to. 4. An air raid warning to be given to the hospitals first, i.e. direct to the doctors-in-charge. Awali hospital will telephone both hospitals, warnings it is hoped will be received from other sources at the onset of a raid.Page No»2 III* Essential Requirements Proposed . 1* Existing hospital equipment to be increased in the way of field dressings, stretchers, splints, and extra beds. The special budget to cotfer this. The present urgency is twelve stretchers. These are being made now. 2. One special ambulance. Three lorries to be improvised as ambulances. 2 . blue buses have very kindly been arranged for by the BAPCO authorities, to operate at night in an emergency. These can be adapted to take 6 stretcher cases, and twelve minor casualties each. 2 . more will be held in reserve. IV. Awali. Dr. Kennedy has generously offered the full support of his Staff should the Manama area become involved while the Camp and Sitra areas remain unaffected ; and this offer would certainly be reciprocated under reverse circumstances. V. Conclusion* Medical Staff, equipment, and some transport, have been ready to operate from the night following the raid on 0ct.l9th. They are now ready for action on the lines of the above improved measures. This scheme is primarily for the Manama medical personnel, but shows the methods of co-operation with the Awali Hospital, the generous aid they have extended to us. Dr. Kennedy and his Staff will be working in the main as a separate unit.California Arabian Standard Oil Company Dhahran, Saudi Arabia October 30, 1940 His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Agent, Bear Sir:- Will you please advise the Port Director at Basrah that the light beacons '3, #5 and ^7 on the Has Tanura channel are not lighted* these beacons should be left dark: as a defense measure. Aach of these beacons has its characteristic flash and this information has been made fully available on published Marine Charts. The relative position of these lights of known characteristics should be of considerable help in identifying this area. The Ras Tanura Peninsula can be readily located from beacons $5 and $7* our terminal operations. In all probability, we shall have very few ships calling at this port. Those ships which do call can be brought in during daylight hours. e should like to suggest for your consideration that It will not be necessary to use these lights for Very sincerely yours CCD:!I made a short flight in a Royal Air Force aircraft last night in order to observe the effectiveness of the present black-out arrangements* Squadron Leader Coates and Mr. Anderson, Superintendent of the Refinery also went up in a second aircraft. We took off at 7 n.m. and remain- ed in the air for approximately an hour flying for most of the time at 3000 feet. My remarks are as follows. (1) The black-out over the Oil Refinery and Awali Camp is satisfactory. The Shaikh’s Palace at Sakhir was a blaze of light* (2) The present regulations regarding dimming of head lights of motor cars are satisfactory. (3) Manama and Muharraq were rather as one would imagine Blackpool would appear if observed at night from the air in August. The black-out over these two towns is entirely ineffective. (4) After the moon had gone down, purely by the aid of the light given by stars it was easily possible to distin guish the outline of the Islands and further to distinguish roads. The pipeline from the Refinery to Sitra was clearly visible. (5) The navigational aids, i.e. the various beacons off Sitra and Manama and the light vessel were easily distin guishable from a considerable distance. /U- ml 2. It can therefore at once be stated ^n the first place there is no object in dealing with navigational aids until more effective steps have been taken to black-out Muharraq and Manama and secondly with aid of a map and given a clear night an aircraft once having found Bahrain can easily locate the Refinery even without the assistance of moonlight. The Refinery could be picked out at once throughthe roads leading to it, round it and away from it and the Camp at Awali was distinguishable in the same way. It therefore remains to be decided whether in view of these facts it is worth continuing with black-out at all. At present there is a glow over Manama visible from about 20 i 2 © miles away and this is caused not so much by electric lights most of which were shaded, but by oil lamps and cook ing fires in barastis and on the roofs of buildings and the riding lights of dhows and other craft at anchor. When the black-out order was issued it was ci^sidered that the light of an oil lamp would not be visible from a distance greater than from half a mile to a mile. This is entirely incorrect and a single hurricane lamp is visible at least from 5 to 6 miles away. It is of course true that later on injthe evening most of these lights would be extinguished and pro bably at about 11 o'clock only a few lights would be showing. But there is no reason to suppose that enemy aircraft will approach only in the early morning. 3. To make the black-out effective therefore every light however small must be shaded from above. Light directed downwards is difficult to see but lights however small showing directly upwards are visible from great dis tances. To effect a proper black-out is therefore going to be an immense task and it seems very doubtful on the face of it whether however great an effort is made a reasonable result can be obtained. 4. On the other side of the picture there is the fact that aircraft attacking Bahrain have to operate from bases a long way off and considerable errors in navigation might i be made if reliance is placed on celestial navigation without the assistance of D/F Wireless. With a total black-out enemy aircraft might fail to find the islands. It appears however /-3 however that in the last raid Wireless was used and my own view is that on a clear night once having reached the coast of the Persian Gulf aircraft could not fail to find Bahrain, black-out or no blackout. On the other hand during the winter months cloudy skies are fairly frequent and in such conditions a total black-out would make it very difficult &amp;s for aircraft to locate their target. In my view it is for the Military (and Naval) authorities to decide whether a total black-out is necessary as a defence measure. The oil field area will of course remain blacked out as at present. If they decide that it is , we will do our best to enforce it but the political side should be placed before them i.e. the difficulties and possible results &gt; of enforcing it. I suggest therefore that (i) the A.L.O. be asked to record his views (ii) we report the matter by letter to the Political Resident who could discuss with A.O.C. on arrival. / ASi'Xh.'v?.

The Naval Base at Juffair was most effectively bla- cked-out , a small amount of light being only visible from 500 ft. when almost directly overhead. 11* Cables and ireleas receiving station was very good, not a single light being visible. The transmitting station was also equally dark but this was rather rendered null and void by the illuminations from surrounding buildings. 12. The black-out of anamah and fuharraq was completely ineffective, but it must be xaat remembered that the law en forcing it had only been brought into force a few days pre viously and also it was the second day of the Id al ritr, the great uslira feast celebrating the end of Tamadhan. 1 '5.

BKFIHSHY FLARES We propose to operate the Refinery in future without any flares, that is, the gas ^fxich was formerly 'burnt in the flares will he discharged out into the atmosphere without 'burning. We have ma&amp;o certain alterations to our flare lines in order to conduct these gases further amy from the Refinery site into a non ha saroous location. The Crude Still flare line, which discharges , at a point near the Forth end of the coke pile, dis- cljarges a very small amount of gas and is not considered to 'be particularly dangerous. The area surrounding the end of the line has 'been fenced and the area has 'been tested since the starting of the Crude Still and found to 'be safe. However, in spite of this it is well that people keep out of this vicinity. The Cracking Still flare now discharges at a point near the overflow from the skinminc pond. The area in this vicinity should 'be considered dangerous; also the area surrounding the outlet from the Polymer Plant flare line. The exact 'boundaries of this dangerous area cannot 'be determined until after the Reformer, Cracking Plant and Polymer Plant have 'been 'brought 'back on stream. When these plants ore on stream tests will 'be made under various weather conditions and eventually a considerable area will 'be fenced off. Pending these tests we have erected 'barricades, one near the South Refinery gate and a secona one opposite the end of the Cracking Plant cooling tower. All guards should 'be removed from 'beyond these 'barriers. Guards should 'be posteu at these 'barriers to keep people and motor vehicles out of the area. As regards protection against sabotage, the Company will undertake to ensure that no possible enemy agents enfcer the Refinery through the Refinery fence adjacent to this pending same definite arrangements./ 4 th November, 1940.

GAS DISPOSAL - PRODUCING AREA, With the return of our eil wells te production, we plan to experiment with the disposal of excess gas to the air without burning, at the five tank batteries. We expect to discharge this gas from a line at each battery rising from 40 to 60 feet from the ground. The immediate vicinity around each riser, will be marked as a danger area, from which all unauthorized persons should be excluded. Will you please inform Major Byard that such danger areas will be established and marked as soon as practicable, and that his guards should be instructed to stay clear of such areas. Also, the guards should be instructed to assist (in so far as is consistent with their tours of inspection) in keeping all persons except recognized members of the Producing Department, from entering these areas. The operation of engines in automotive equipment or the existence of any flame or spark, will be particularly hazardous in these vicinities.UC-!&gt; GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN ) ? )t * l / NOTICE No. ^6/1359• The foi±owing order for reducing all lights in Bahrain iff aade by the Government of Bahrain as a precaution against attack by hostile aircraft on the territory of Bahrain. 1. iror xno Purpose of this Order 'Lights' shall mean electric lights, lights from petromax lamps or other lamps of similar manufacture, oil flares, fires and other bright lights but outside the area of operations covered by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Unless specially v£L^-this order stated shall not include hurricane lamps or similar small lamps burning oil through a wick, cycle lamps or electric torches. 2. Between the hours oi sunset and sunrise no lights except those of motor vehicles which have been dimmed in accordance with the provisions of this Order are to be shown in the open without permission. All lights in shops, houses, buildings or dwelling places of any sort must be effectively screened in order to prevent light of a greater intensity than that shown by a small oil lamp being visible from outside. 3. Steamers entering the Port of Bahrain may show only those’ lights which are essential for the working of cargo and these must be effectively screened from above. Ridinglights of dhows and other craft at anchor within the territorialwaters of Bahrain will be continued but the degree of their illumination will be controlled by the Port Officer at his discretion. 4. The dimming of headlights, sidelights and tail lights of motor vehicle^will be carried out by the State Engineer’s Department .who may summon the owners or drivers of such motor vehicles to attend at any place the department may appoint for the purpose. The degree anu metnod of dimming for each vehicle will be according to the following specifications Headi-miita The lamp glass will be painted black with non-tranaluoent paint except for (a) a horizontal strip across the width of the lamp, one inch deep and below the centre line of the lamp glass and (b) a rectangle one inch high and two inches long in the centre of the lamp with its base on the centre line of the lamp glass. Sidelights The lamp glass will be painted black with non-translucent paint except for a circle in the centre of the lamp of radius. Tail Lights The lamp glass of that part of the lamp which is used for illuminating the number plate will be blacked completely. The red glass of the tail lamp will be painted black with non-trcnslucent paint except for a circle of £* radius. No other lights except headlights, sidelights and tail lights which have been dimmed in accordance with the ProvisionsI of this Order may be shown on any motor vehicle when being driven between the hours of sunset and sunrise. If the owner of any motor vehicle considers that owing to the state of the lam^s the degree of dimming required by this order would not permit the vehicle to be driven with safety at night at 25 m.p.h. he shall produce the vehicle for inspection by the State Engineer’s Department • The State Engineer may then at his discretion reduce the araton the lamp glass painted black and give the owner a written certificate that this has been permitted. 5, The sp#ed limit for all oars, whether public or private, during the hours between sunset and sunrise will be 30 miles P.H# or 48 £elo P.H. The spped limits within municipal areas of Manama &amp; luharraq will be as « previously laid down in Elans, i.e. ZZ miles p.h. 6.

I have the honour to refer to the Air Liaison Officer Bahrain's letter No.ALO/S/Air/20 dated 4th November, 1940, concerning the black-out at Bahrain. 2. I suggest (a) That the light buoys and beacons at Sitra should be extinguished. (b) That the Bahrain Light Vessel should not be extinguished since it cannot be seen until aircraft are over the Island and it is most desirable that, if possible, it should be kept burning for shipping. (c) That the Manamah buoys should not be extinguished. I consider they would be of little practical value to aircraft attempting to bomb the refinery. 3. If you concur I propose a date should be decided upon for extinguishing the Sitrah Lights in order that I can inform the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station and issue the necessary instructions to shipping.

At present the rectangle of one inch high and two inches long allows a powerful beam to issue which is nearly as dangerous as the full glare, especially on the Manama-Awali road, in that the beam shines along above the road; and, on a slope, naturally points to the sky. I suggest that an effective method of dimming would be such as diffuses an area of glow upon the highway just ahead of the vehicle. 3. At present traffic along the Manama-Awali road ismore dangerous than before because this beam from an approaching motor dazzles one; and it becomes impossible to see the road. For safety one is force] to slow down considerably and blow the horn. especially taxis,very rarely reduce their headlights when approaching another car, and very rarely reduce their speed, which, in such a narrow road under these conditions, should never be more than thirty miles, or fifty kilometers, per hour. Recent accidents go to prove this. 4. I trust that it would not be out of place if I suggest t! ^ all cars other than private vehicles should by order be equipped with governors' so that their speed cannot exceed the above limit, while their headlights should be so shaded as to prevent any direct beam issuing from the headlight. 2 I submit that effectively to dim the headlights, it Added to this danger is the fact that oncoming cars, I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully.Confidential 1.0, No. C/870-^6/13 Dated tde 10th Nove/nber 1040 I neve received copies of the correspondence l4s of between you and the Defence Officer, Bahrain, dated the 4th November lo40 about brack-out arrangements for the Refinery, In Anderson’s letter to you I see that the black-out for the Refinery has been fixed to commence from 9 p.m, each night and he mentions that this has the tacit approval of tne autnorities.

My comments are as follows 1. The black-out of the Refinery and Awali Camp has dete riorated considerably. Lights were visible from 3000 ft. over most of the Refinery and particularly north and south of the Power House and in the cracking units. The ,, dummy ,, refinery placed at some distance to the south was entirely ineffective owing to the large number of lights visible from the Refinery itself. Lights in the Awali Camp seemed generally spread over the area of the Camp. 2. Black-out over Manama and Muharraq although far from satisfactory has improved since my last flight. A large number of electric lights in houses belonging in many cases to Europeans are still visible. 3. Motor car headlights as at present dimmed are clearly visible from 3000 ft. but not from any great distance away. In many cases the paint used to black-out headlights has come off as a result of the rain. The dimming of headlights could I think be made more satisfactory if the breadth of the aperture were reduced and the line of the aperture placed * well below the centre line of the lamp. This amongst other things would obviate the risk of dazzling. 4. Navigation lights are still burning and are distinguish able from a considerable distance away. 5. Bright lights were visible in the direction of A1 Khobar. So far as I could tell from the air they were not oil flares but lights on the landing wharves. Although I spoke to Mr. Ohliger about this the lights were still burning the day after my flight. 3d/- R.I. Hallows. 28th November 1940.D.O* No. C/927-28/13 Dated the 30th November 1940. As you know the question of the degree to which black-out could be enforced in Bahrain had been held in abeyance pending instructions from the Royal Air Force Headquarters. Royal Air Force Headquarters have now expressed the opinion that we should enforce the black out as far as may be reasonably possible. I think that we should now proceed to enforce the black-out regulations more strictly and I should be very grateful if you could make arrangements for police patrols to visit the resi dential and bazaar areas in Manama and Muharraq and take the names of all persons failing to comply with the regu lations with a view to prosecution. 2.

Before going up in the aeroplane I discussed the observation with the Air Liaison Officer and he was anxious that I should observe (a) Muharr&amp;q and T'anauiah from above and from 3 or 4 miles distance. (b) The oil refinery and camp. 3. There were a few strong lights in Manamsh although I was not sufficiejitly acquainted with the layout of the town to be able to say where they were situated on the ground. One very bright light in or near Elanamah or JUiharraq was visible from Awali. tfhen approached from the direction of the sea lights in J/ai^iaah were visible from a distance which I estimated at from 2 to 3 miles* 4. Tne position of oil refinery was apparent soon after leaving the air field at Luharraq because large flames either from a furnace or of escaping gas were burning. These were extinguished as the aircraft approached Awali. 5. The refinery in Awali was clearly visible from a distance of 1 to 2 miles as there were two bright lights showing on or near the roof of what appeared to be the main building. There were also many chinks of light shoeing e^ll over the building which showed a broad band of light points which would appear to delineate the position of the building. The effect of lights covered from above shining through open doorways or verandahs does not appear to have been appreciated These are visible from aircraft approaching the lighted buildincr.

To: - H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN: ^ 0 MEMORANDUM :- May I invite a reference to your Order of 29th October, 194o., made under Defence Regulation No.4., which relates to the 'black-out'. 2. On the night of the 21st January, 1941., an unusually violent storm was raging, and there was no moon. Two down-mail steamers were expected; and doubtless country craft were at sea striving to secure shelter at Bahrain. I have since heard that one Bahrain craft was wrecked at sea, and some of its crew were drowned. 3. Having regard to the wording of Clause 2. of the Order, I mentioned to you by telephone that, to afford assistance to these steamers and/or craft I proposed to light the Pier sea light, which was done. One steamer made her anchorage at nine o'clock p.m.; and the No.2. (Anchor) light was shone until the return of the Quarantine Medical Officer, the Air Liaison Officer, and the Naval Officer-in-Charge from their duties aboard this ship. A heavy dangerous sea was running. 4. Objection to my action was taken by the local Superintendent of Police who telephoned stating that he was responsible to the Royal Air Force authorities in Iraq for the maintenance of the black-out in Bahrain; and I pointed out that he was not responsible for control of the lighting of the Port. I do not question this Officer's enthusiasm. 5. Clause 3 . of the Order does not, however, refer to the Pier Light, which is recorded in the Admiralty's Persian Gulf Sailing Directions, as 'an occasional light, to be lighted upon request'. Although the light was then used under exceptional circumstances, its use might give rise to some misunderstanding. Might I therefore ask if you would be good enough to favour me with your opinion as to whether or not the operation of this light should be brought within the Clause 3 . I might add that the Maharaq Customs Light was formerly in use for navigation; but this has been discontinued since the black-out .- ?=mp-CONFIDENTIAL.

Dear Mr. Hmith, If you will remember I asked you in one of my previous letter to inform me to stop showing lights on my house for steamers arriving here at night or during the hours of darkness, if you ever think it necessary for us to stop it. About a few weeks ago Khan Sahib Seyyed Aodul Razzaq, in a conversation with me, gave a hint about some sort of 'Blackout”, but he did not definitely tell me to observe 'Black-Out'. All he asid was ' I am afraid, I am afraid ' which I took to be a warning that I should black out. I vainly tried to get him to say definitely that I should not show lignts on the top of my house, however, may I ask you to kindly enquire from the authorities concerned and give me definite instructions as to whether I should continue to show lights on top of my house when steamers arrive here during the hours of darkness or I should not.

Dear Sir, During the present situation in Basrah it is considered inadvisable for our flyingboats to remain there for longer than is necessary to refuel, and Bahrein has therefore been made one terminal of the shuttle service to and from Cairo. Starting from May 23rd, aircraft will therefore fly from Cairo to Bahrein on Fridays and Sundays, and return to Cairo on Saturdays and Mondays. Connecting aircraft from India will also trach Bahrein on Fridays and Sundays, and return on Saturdays and Mondaysi so that on the nights of Friday/Saturday and Sunday/Monday there will be two aircraft at anchor. It is possible that the aircraft returning to Cairo will have to make a night take off, necessitating the use of flares and searchlights for a short period and, in any case, the cargos of the two meeting aircraft, the second of which will arrive late in the evening, will have to be changed over in darkness, necessitating the use of a certain amount Of light on the aircraft themselves and on the R.A.F. Jetty while this is going on. We would assure you that every care will be taken to reduce the lighting to a minimum, and trust that these opera tions will be in order. ft Yours faithfully.

The Naval Officer in Charge, Jufair.fjf ■sif - sr Bahrain, July 30, 1941 Dear Alban, For some time many of the public, especially the Shaikhs, have been getting rather restive about the black-out in Manama and Muharraq which appears to them to be unnecessary owing to the present dis position of the war. After discussing it several times with the senior Shaikhs I told them that I would write to you and obtain your views on the matter. I discussed the question myself, unofficially, with Brigadier Hughes and he gave me to understand that it was his personal opinion that the black-out in Manama and Muharraq did not at present serve any useful purpose, but I daresay he would not wish to be quoted in this matter. The black-out was imposed after the Italian raidj when Italy still occupied the Red Sea portion the advice of the A.O.C., Iraq. The position would appear to have changed a good deal since then so perhaps the military authorities could be eonsulted again and asked whether some relaxation of the black out in houses, not cars or street lights, could be made. Yours sincerely, Major R.G.E.W. Alban, O.B.E., H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.Major D.O.No.C/809-28/13* Dated the 4th August X941, Belgrave has written in to ask if there can be some mitigation of the black-out. He has apparently been approached to do so by the senior Shaikhs. He points out the change in the w ar situation since the raid in last November, and mentions Brigadier Hughes as having given it as his private opinion that the Manama/Muharraq black-out does not serve any useful purpose. I would myself suggest that the responsibility for the decision in this matter now rests on military shoulders, and we are only concerned with interpreting their ideas and putting them across on the State. If you agree, I will try to get a ruling from the Military Mission, or from Hewitt, and will wire their opinion to ^ou ( ? repeating to P. H. ) for confirmation. My own opinion is that, with the exception of car headlights, and unnecessarily bright outside lights R.G.E.W. Alban, C.B.E., ( e.g.... Political Agent, Bahrain, Camp, Karachi.- 2 • (e*g* those which Shaikh Hamad used to have round his minaret at Sakhir) which might help planes approaching from a distance! we should relax the black-out, especially in view of the present temperature - and declare Manama and Muharraq to be open towns - though that is perhaps no real protection against the Axis l But they are hardly worth a bomb. A secondary point, on which we should perhaps con sult the Resident, would then be whether I may give publi city to this declaration by the radio. I will not comment on this, till I know your views on the major point. Yours sincerely.Confidential D. 0. No. K/3 Office of the Political Agent, Bahrain.

' I am of ooinion that the degree of Black-out may now be reasonably relaxed. It is my ooinion that it is unnecessary at oresent to enforce a black-out in general until 21.30 hrs. nightly, and that in special cases this period may be extended. I would suggest that in cases where it is desired that this period should be extended that the Defence Officer be consulted, and at the same time he should be told what arrangements can be made for a speedy extinction of lights, especially those out of door$ I would not recommend any relaxation in the Black out as applied to cars, owing to the difficulty of enforcing it again. In making these recommendations I am influenced by the fact that somewhat similar rules hold force at Basra. [(.i T.btsvZA vMi Major, DEFENCE OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF.Confidential D.O.No*0/920-28/13.

In this connection I would remark that the local law is that (except during the month of Rama dhan) all places of business, i.e. coffee-shops etc., must close at night at four hours after sunset, and all lighting in private houses should cease at five hours after sunset. Since the time of sunset varies slightly during the year, and the Arabic method of time-keeping is current in the State,and many people are unacquainted with Local Standard Time; I propose that the Bahrain Government’s Proclamation shall state: ’’Four hours after sunset”, instead of ”9.30 p.m.”.

In reference to your No: DKF/M-83/B42 of the 29th October, and particularly as to the black-out on motor-cars, I would invite your attention to the fact^tne present method of dimming motor-car head lights is ineffective, because the unblacked space across the lamp-glass, being across the middle of the glass, is placed too high up, and permits all the glare and dazzle from the lamp to escape and shine (especially when a vehicle proceeds uphill) upwards, the light being actually needed upon the road, not in the air. The impression received from an approaching oar is that tho lamp-glass is not blacked out at all, because of the dazzle. A better method of controlling the light would be (1) to paint black a little more than one-half of the upper part of the lamp-glass and a little more than one-half of the lower part of the inside reflector. This method has already proved successful in England as it casts the light down upon the road; or (2) to lower the unblacked space across the lamp-glass by at least one inch. Then the glare would dazzle only when the vehicle is proceeding uphill. In the meanwhile the Police have been ordered to observe and report upon all cars whose lights may be considered to be unsatisfactory.

Medical Officer, Awali Camp, came to see me on the 16th March. 2. He made three representations: (1) He was trained in A.R.P. work and was anxious to assist in this kind of work in Bahrain.' (2) He maintained that the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company were doing war work and that they should be considered along with members of the Fighting Services for civilian posts after the war. (3) He stated that he had attended the detachment of troops at Awali for one year 3 months without any charge and suggested that he should be given some title in return for this work. 3. I leave it to you to take any action you may consider desirable or necessary on these requests. The second request seems logical, especially if industrial conscription is applied, but I am rather doubtful if any useful purpose would be served by addressing the Govern ment of India on the subject at present.

In regard to the proposed demonstrations at Manamah and Muharraq will you please consult the Adviser to the Bahrain Government ? No propaganda has yet been done among the public in regard to A.B.P. and it may be premature to have public demons trations at this stage. It will, however, be very useful for responsible persons who are likely in the future to become air wardens ,, etc., to be present at the demons trations. The people I had in mind are N.C.Os of the State Police, members of the municipalities of Manamah and Muharraq, hospital staffs, and possibly British residents of Manamah who are likely to take a lead in organising preventive measures if an air raid does take place. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Belgrave and you will no doubt decide, either now or after the party have arrived, on the places where the demonstrations should be held. - i / / Yours sincerely, Major H.T.Hewitt, 1 T .C^, Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, Awali.

S.Z.Extract from * INDIAN INFORMATION * Vol. 10, No.88, February 15th, 1942. Lesson of Rangoon Raids is 'TAKE SHELTER * 'The greatest lesson which we have learnt from the Rangoon raids- is that we must educate the people to stay in their houses or to get into shelters, and it is hoped that from now onwards every practice that is held in India will be for the people and not for the A.R.P. services alone,' said an official spokesman in a survey of the Jap anese raids on the Barman capital. The Japanese launched two heavy raids on Rangoon on December 23 and 25, 1941. In each case, there were over fifty bombers escorted by a number of fighters. British and American fighters went up to meet them and shot down 40 - an enormous proportion of losses, for it has been estimated that a Joss of 10 per cent in a raiding air force is a serious loss to the enemy. No air force in the world can continue heavy raids if it suffers losses as high as 30 per cent, as did the Jap anese on these occasions. It is important to note that the Japanese have attempt ed no big raids since then. There have been no bombing raids by day, only a sweep by fighters. The raids have been carried out only at night and with a few planes which appear to have concentrated on military objectives. There is in Rangoon, in addition to British R.A.F. fighters, a number also of American Volunteer fighter planes and pilots. Some of the fighters which brought down the Japanese planes were manned by these Americans. The two big raids appear to have been directed mainly at civilian morale. Very little damage was done to mili tary objectives, and there was little material damage in the city, in comparison to the total of buildings there. CASUALTIES HEAVY IN THE OPEN Civilian casualties were heavy in the first raid owing to the fact that people either failed to get into the slit trenches and shelters (of which there were many on the street pavements) where they would have been quite safe, or even left them and ran into the open during the raid. Others did not attempt to seek shelter within their houses but huddled in groups in doorways. There were no casualties among the people in shelters and slit trenches, even though bombs fell within 30 f^et of these. But there was a heavy death-roll among people in open spaces. It is estimated that in the first raid on December 23 nearly 1,000 people were killed, or were dying before they were formally admitted to hospitals, and 950 were in jured. Barman and Indian casualties were about half and half. A number died in hospital* There were, before evacuation of casualties to India began, some 320 Indians injured in Rangoon hospitals. Many of these have now been brought, under special care, to hospitals in India. When the first raid occurred the people were to some extent stunned by what was happening / Afterw © After that, large numbers of them left the city and made for the open country or went away along the exit roads. Evacuation camps had been prepared outside the city by the authorities, but large numbers of Burmese and In dians seem to have decided to go as far away as possible. Some even went as far as Prome, but later decided to re turn to Rangoon and special trains were sent to bring them back. Many of these have now been accommodated in camps outside the city, where they are being fed by the author ities. Most have their own cooking utensils and the camps have the appearance of villages newly sprung up. EVACUATION ARRANGEMENTS The evacuation camps previously erected by the author ities were designed to deal with people whom it might be necessary to.take out of the city by order in preparation for siege conditions. These were of the greatest value for the purpose of feeding and caring for the refugees, but they were not suited for prolonged residence in air raid conditions and were rapidly exchanged for more suit able and more dispersed camping sites, where the return ing people could live in safety in smaller units and take up a life in accordance with their customary conditions of living. Amongst those who left the city after the first raid were many of the menial municipal services, transport drivers and others who v/ere necessary to the work of clear ing up after the raid. This introduced some difficulty temporarily in the disposal of the dead and other municipal services. But with the help of stout-hearted volunteers the difficulty was overcome. The dead were taken to mortuaries at the cemeteries where they were retained for 24 hours for identification and the corpses were then duly buried or burnt, as was done after the Bihar earthquake. FEWER CASUALTIES IN SECOND RAID In the second raid, there were fewer people on the streets and in open spaces, and casualties were very much lighter only 50 being killed and another 50 injured. There were in the two raids a dozen or so of consider able fires, but these were brought under control. A certain amount of damage was done by these, but they were of small extent compared to the total area, and apart from them then was very little material damage. The communications in Rangoon are good, and it was a comparatively easy task to limit the spread of fires. THREE TYPES OF BOMBS USED. Among the bombs used by the Japanese were high ex plosive bombs which had a very limited' effect, anti-personn el bombs, which are dangerous if people stay in the open, but innocuous when cover is taken, and incendiary bombs.- The lest mentioned contained pellets of phosphorous. These pel lets burn quietly and can easily be put out by throwing a cup of water over them. But they have the property of relighting if left to dry and receive the heat of the sun. When found they should be collected in a receptacle of water, and then be allowed to burn themselves out somewhere in the open where they can do no harm. Some buildings sustained direct hits from high explosive and incendiary bombs, and, though fires were started and windows broken, the buildings themselves were not brought down as a whole. The headmaster of the Gujarati High School, where a bomb penetrated the building, had an extraordinary escape. He was standing in the angle of a pillar about 20 feet from the burst of the bomb but was entirely uninjured. The children were on holiday, and though the staircase was damaged and some windows broken, there were no casualties and no fire, and the damage will be easily repaired. NEED FOR LEADERSHIP The raids made clear the need for training, discipline and, above all, leadershij-) in all A.R.P. services Paper schemes and training in accordance with them are beneficial and necessary, but when the test comes it is courage, initiative and leadership that counts above all else. The raids also show that we must feed our A.R.P. services while they are at work; the firemen in Rangoon worked loyally' and continuously for eighteen hours. Food was provided for them or they could not possibly have done so much, and an organization to carry food to all our services in India is nww to be established. Transport in sufficient quantity, and with stout-hearted drivers who will not flinch from danger is another necessity which the Rangoon raids bring out. In Rangoon there were three large regular hospitals and four emergency hospitals, with well over a thousand beds available in all. The Japanese made no attempt to spare either the civil population or their hospitals and indeed directed their attack against both. One hospital was hit by five bombs, but doctors, Nurses and volunteers continued their work at the n£ight of the raid. More lives could have been saved had blood transfusion been more generally possible. In India there are blood-banks in Calcutta and Delhi and blood can be taken without any harm to the giver, preserved, and used to save life if raids on India should occur. The homeless in Rangoon have been settled in dispersion camps outside the city'. All the Provincial Governments in India have under consideration the construction of such dispersion and rest camps, and the problem of dispersal of population is also engaging active attention. In some cases these camps have already been established. The Burman authorities, in the first place, decided to restrict permits for deck space to women and children and those accompanying them. This injunction was shortly afterwards re laxed to the extent of reserving 70 per cent of the deck space for women and children; and as the pressure of these firsu claimants is dealt with and shipping increases, furtner relaxa tion will be possible. /InM © * * * In India the problem of receiving those who arrive and need advice and assistance in getting to their homes is receiving the fullest attention, and it is expected that the organization will very shortly be in full working order and able to deal with all the demands made upon it. * * * RAIDS AIMED AT CIVILIANS The air raid on Rangoon on December 23, 1941, was made by a large force of bombers escorted by fighters and was clearly aimed at the civilian population, said a Civil Defence Department communique of December 29, 1941. A very high proportion of the Japanese aircraft are known to have been brought down. Casulaties were fairly heavy where people came on to the streets and extremely light where they took cover either in their houses, or in trenches or in shelters. In one quarter where the population obeyed orders and took cover there was no death and only a very few were slightly injured. The experience of Rangoon shows the vital importance of taking cover at once. Casualties dueto fragments of bombs would have been much lighter had orders been complied with by the public immediately the warning signal was given. The Government of India cannot too strongly impress on all concerned that the safest course for them is to remain in their houses, or, if outside, to take shelter. . Where it is possible to dig even a shallow trench inside the house or courtyard and stay in this with the bed or table over it, this will afford protection.Wt. 36569/2597 1,485,000 2/38 D.P.W.

Much the most valuable and interesting document is the Note by the Director General Civil Defence (India) on the Rangoon Air Raids. Do you think it would be possible to prepare a pamphlet in Arabic bringing out the salient points of this report? Much the most important thing seems to me to be to make every single person in Manama and Muharraq realise that he or she must take shelter if there is an air raid or, if there is no shelter near, or only a barasti hut, people must lie down on the ground. Police and rescue squads and wardens would also be given confidence if they know that they are only expected to work after an air raid is over. Force might be given to ex hortations to people to take shelter if they understood what happens when a bomb explodes, and if they knew that in Rangoon hundreds and hundreds of people who remained in streets and doorways were killed, and no one who took shelter in a house or trench was killed. Do you think it would be a good thing to propagate the gospel of self-preservation through the schools? If things are put in the right way people need not be scared but would be given confidence.

Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohd, Sup T t, State Police. S/I Abdul Karim, State Police. The meeting discussed A.R.P. measures which have already been taken and further measures which appear to be necessary. The Defence Officer, Persian Gulf and the Officers of the Royal Air Force made suggestions and offered advice. Measures already taken include the following a. Black-out including dimming of car lights. b. Provision of trenches in Manama. c. Medical scheme incorporating the Government medical staff, the American Mission and V.M. hospital. d. Police scheme. e. Air-raid warning. f. Fire appliances (3 fire engines). a. It was decided that the black-out should be strictly enforced from 9.30 P.M. in Manama and Moharraq. It was emphasised by the R.A.F. officers that the most effective protection against night bombing would be a complete black out. After discussion it was agreed that in case of an air raid electric current would be turned off at the main, this would not affect telephone services.—3— 2 /&amp;/ b. It was decided that the number of trenches in Manama should be increased and trenches should be constructed in Moharraq and certain villages on Moharraq Island. Owing to the difficulty in finding space in Moharraq for trenches it was suggested that they might be built in the open spaces within the mosques. c &amp; d.The Medical and Police themes were not discussed in detail. e. The likelihood of advance information of an impending raid was considered. Should methods exist to give an advance warning then a local air raid warning and all clear signal would be necessary. It was suggested that a steam whistle might be operated from Mr. Hussain Yateem's ice plant or a ship's siren obtained from Casoc, who are known to possess one or more. f. The existing location of the three fire stations was considered suitable. 2. Additional measures to be taken in hand included the following a. Precautions against incendiary bombs. It was proposed by a fnimber oftU committee and approved by the meeting that the Government should be asked to order the removal of the matting roofs from the Manama and Moharraq bazaars which are a source of danger from fire which might result in the dest ruction of the oazaar area and all the food supplies contained in the bazaars. It was suggested that the roofs should be replaced at the Governraent expenses after the war and in the meantime the material should be taken over by the Government. The committee decided to prepare a notice for the public telling them what preparations to make in order to be able to deal with incendiary bombs. The Defence Officer provided notes on incendiary bombs to assist the committee in framing a notice.Samples of specially made sand bags were inspected. Squadron Leader D T Agapeyej^r explained various alternative methods which could be adopted if the regular equipment was not available. It was recommended that areas of the town containing barasti houses should be segregated and divided into sections to prevent fires spreading. b. It was decided that air raid wardens should be appointed by the committee in Manama and Moharraq. The maps showing census divisions of districts which had been made during the census.^ A list of duties of wardens should be drawn up by the committee. c. The possibility of using three high minj^arets in Manama for fire watching was considered, in the event of certain arrangements by the Royal Air Force, these could be effectively used. The meeting, which commenced at 10.50 A.M., broke up at 12.30 AoM. A committee meeting was arranged for Saturday 25th April at 11 A.M.# 5 ^ D.O.No. CjSI - Thank you very much for the Air Raid Precaution literature and note on Rangoon raids contained in or* your No. C/719 dated 24th May 1942, the last is extremely interesting and useful.

Minutes of a meeting of the- the Air Raid Precautions Committee held at the Adviserate on Saturday, 30th May 1942. Reference to previous correspondence :■— 2— Minutes of a meeting of the Air Raid Precautions Committee held at the Adviserate on Saturday, 30th May, 1942. A meeting of the Air Raid Precautions Committee was held at the Adviserate on Saturday 30th May 1942 at 11 A.M. The following were present:- The Adviser, Mr. J. Mo Camphell, Haj Khalil hin Ibrahim Kanoo, Haj Hussain Yateem, Haj Yusuf Mahnood Hussain, Haj Mohamed Saleh Shatter, Mr. A. Edwards, (Ashraf Bros). The maps of Manama and Kuharraq on which the existing trench-shelters were marked were studied. It was decided that shelters were needed more urgently in saaf districts than in districts containing stone houses. Haj Yusuf Mahmood Hussain (Moharraq) said that in his opinion 30 to 35 more shelters were needed in Muharraq. Haj Khalil Kanoo (Manama) suggested 50 to 60 more shelters in Manama. The Adviser suggested putting an inner wall of sand bags two or three feet from the existing cement wall of the customs round-about which could be used as an air raid shelter. Asked about suggestions for more shelters, Haj Hussain Yateem suggested making some shelters for the population on the east shore of Manama from the old Telegraph station to Gozaibia. Haj Mohamed Saleh suggested deve loping the old drain ffom G-ozaibia swamp running to the sea in the east into a shelter fur that area. Owing to shortage of bags, it was suggested that murabba or fashti stones should be used for raising the side walls of trenches, also for shelters above ground level. Haj Yusuf Mahmood Hussain suggested converting the present enclosure in Moharraq known as rt Hotat Shaikh KaI^ad ,, into a shelter.2 \(ok Asked about propaganda for AoR.P., all the members said that the article which appeared in the newspaper yesterday was not relished by the public but they agreed that more articles were necessary to make the publicc prepare themselves for an emergency. They agreed that every individual should be taught to take shelter immedi ately on warning. The committee was of the opinion that the pamphlet No.(6l which was sent around to the members should be translated into Arabic and freely distributed. It was decided that the Broadcasting Station should be used as a medium for all announcements about precautions, especially about every single individual, be he a policeman, a warden, fire fighter, driver, or doctor, taking shelter immediately on the warning and doing the work of relief or otherwise after the raid only. Haj Hussain Yateem suggested that on the days when A.R.P. announcements are made on the radio, the station should be asked to announce something to the effect that an important announcement about A.R.P. would be heard by them later. Regarding air raid warnings; it was suggested that Mr. W.B. Steele, the State Engineer, should be consulted about sirens of the type used by Casoc launches. Regarding lack of voulanteers for warden* duties; the members said that people are afraid that if they enlisted as wardens they would later be asked by the G-overnment to do other duties which they might not be able to perform. Haj Khalil Kanoo suggested that more articles should be inserted in the newspaper explaining what the wardens are expected to do. Haj Hussain Yateem3 Ibl and Haj Yusuf Mahmood suggested that if the Ruling iamily volunteered others would have confidence and volunteer. Mr. J. M. Campbell suggested that after the pamphlet is translated and circulated, the members of the committee should speak to likely volunteers explaining that their duties would be before and after but not during raids. Before a raid they would have to explain to the inhabitants of their fariq the different methods of protection and explain the precautionsmen tioned in the pamphlet. The Adviser read out extracts from a report on the raids on Rangoon which the members listened to with great interest. It was suggested t at some foodstuffs should be stored outside Iv'anama in order to avoid possibility of losing the whole supply if the bazaar was burnt. Haj Yusuf Mahmood Hussain complained that saaf construction within amarahs in Moharraq have not been removed and naj Khalil Kanoo said that in Manama most of the saafl roofs have been removed. It was agreed that ooth municipalities should be written to asking them to take action. Particular mention was made of an amarah Cj-ose to tne petrol station at Moharraq where saaf and date sticks are sold. Haj Hussain Yateem suggested that in case of a fire due to air raid only one fire engine should rush to the spot, and the others should remain in their places ready to go to other sites where fires may be reported. The meeting terminated at 1 P.M.

(May 28, 1942;.Published in the Bahrain Newspaper on 1^/5/1361. no './hat happened at Rangoon may happen in jahrain. The Bahrain Government has obtained, official infor mation about tiie air raids by the Japanese on Rangoon. The things which happened in Rangoon happened, in many other places which were attacked by Japanese aeroplanes anu it is possible to learn many useful things by consi dering the facts about the air rains on Rangoon, Rangoon is a city containing 5,00,000 people. Manama and Muharra^ together have a population of 45,000 people. Rangoon is built in European fashion with clocks of buildings, 300 JL 200 yarns each ulocK separated by wide roads, these wide roaus prevented fires from spreading. Our towns have few wide streets, the houses are very close together and fires could spread easily. In Rangoon the important offices and houses are uuill of cement concrete, the small houseware of wood roofed witn iron. In Bahrain the new ana important buildings are made of cement and stone, older buildings are of stone ana mud but we have many barastis which will burn even more easily than the wooden' houses of Rangoon. During the first raid on Rangoon 1250 people were killed immediately, about 1000 were wounded ana 2/3 of the wounded people died from tneir wounus. Let us compare the casualties in Rangoon to casual ties which might happen in Bahrain, taking into consi deration the difference in the population. This would mean that in a similar air raid against Manama ana Muharraq 112 people would be killed immediately ana ninety would ue injured, of the ninety 6u might die from wounds. But in Rangoon the inhabitants haa been preparing against air raids for many months, A.R.R._organisatipn existed and warning was given about the first air raicus' almost an hour before the aeroplanes arrived, what would be the condition mi our cities if suddenly enemy aeroplanes began to drop bombs and use machine guns against the people? The tarpets which the enemy attacked in Rangoon were the docks, the congested part of the city such as our bazaars, ihe aerodrome ana the x^ower house. During the second raiq_on Rangoon only 50 people were killed and about 50 v .ore injured. Why were 1250 people killed in the first raid and only 50 on the second raid? The reason for the large number of casualties in the first raid was because people aid not take_shelter. No buildings were knocked down by high explosion bombs ana no people in shelters were hit. xill the people who were — killed —2 © /?/ „ killed and wounded v;ere in the open, standing in doorways, running in the streets, watching the aeroplanes. The bombs used by the Japanese in riangoon and which, if balirain was boated, might oe usea here, sena sharp metal splinters, like razor blades, with terrific force, which kill people who are standing 50 or 60 yards from where the bomb strikes the ground. In some cases peo ple who were 300 yards away from the bomb were killed. The height of these splinters is from the Height of a man’s knee to his chest. They cause terrible wounas. But these splinters no not enter tne ground nor do they go through stone walls or Sana bags, but tney will go through barastis. What lessons no these facts teach us? To avoid be^g killed or wounded people must seem shelter in houses or in channels or pits. To stay in the open is to invite death. It is for this reason that the Government is buil ding trenches in manama and Muharraq. and if there is a raid all people who are outside should immediately enter these trenchers or enter stone mouses or ditches or if trey from house or trenches when bombs are falling they should lie flat on the ground as it is possible that the splinters from tne bomb will pass above them. The Government is taking measures but the help ana co-operation of the public is necessary. In other countries thousands of people volunteered to heklp the authorities hy instructing the population what to ao in case of air raids. It is before ana after the raid that action has to be taken. During the time that bombs are falling all persons whether private citizens or officials or police must remain in cover. Tne Bahrain Government recently called lor volunteers for A.h.P. work from the people of Banana ana ^uharraq, out of the 45,660 persons living in these two towns how many people offered their services? Eleven people of whom only four were Arabs.SECRET. Ref:- Office of the Defence Officer, Def/Air/S/6. Persian Oulf at Bahrain, Awali, 8th February, 1941. The Chief Local Representative, Messrs.

I have the honour to refer to your letter of 16th January, 1941. Decision in this matter must lie in the answer to the following question. ^ ^ . . In Vie ' v the other marks and aids available, will the additional reduction of light effect, created by the ^ hese buoys, add enough to the navigational difficulties of aircraft to prevent them finding their tar get ? . s ° the occasional twelve hour delay of tankers is a price worth paying for that security. If not any delay is most inadvisable* 2. There are two ways of effecting this reduction of light. Ci) Close the port of Sitrah by night. (ii) Close the port only to incoming traffic and light the buoyage as requisite for moving ships already in port. Between August 1st and present date about fifty entries and departures have been made by night. 3. The final decision in this matter will of course be made by the authority ordering the black-out after con sultation with appropriate Defence Officer and considering the preceding facts and argument. 4. Any action or promulgation of information, consq- quent on the decision of that authority, to all Merchant Shipping is the responsibility of and is accepted by Naval Authority. 5. I would suggest that a decision should accordingly be obtained from the appropriate authority which should be communicated to the Bahrain Petroleum Company as well as the sense of my paragraph 4, a point upon which they seem to be uninformed. 6. 1 would also expect to receive notification of any such decision in due course.

Dear Colonel Hay, In reference to the war position and the vulnerability of Bahrain to an attack, mainly directed towards the Bahrain Petroleum Company*e refinery, hy hostile aircraft; may I submit to you several points :• 1 . It can be easily assumed that enemy aircraft would by night. Thus, the easiest way to reach the Refinery would be to find the lightship •BAHRAIN*, thence the °utar Buoy, the _ Inner Buoy, the West Spit Buoy (all of which ar# and, turning South, proceed oyer the Ras Zarwan flashlight beacon, over Manama; and, guided by tM . Ain al Adhari, the enemy would be directed straight to h Refinery. To mislead the enemy, all these flash-light buoys snould be extinguished. The necessity for them at present is, un fortunately, not pressing, as the number of steamers is roub le as, and they all make port in daylight. 2. Some time ago Captain L.S.Parke discussed with me at great length the defences of Aden, where he was Chief of Police There he put in a system of dummy markings and misleading around lights which were completely successful against t.ie &amp;auL iir-?aUsf I suggest that similar mi b leading markings and dimmed lights could be put in from the Jeb*i sA Bukkan southwards; so that, except on bright moonlit nights, the enemy would be similarly misled. x The bright white plastering of buildings in Bahrain not only creates a brilliant glare in the daytime, but ai ? o a erys asvery clearly distinguishable land-marks at night-time, even when 8 there is no moonlight.

Sir, ,, 4 reference to your No.409-S dated 19th ay, 1942, I have the honour to infonn you that I am ;inable to agree with the suggestion that the light buoys leading to Sitrah Anchorage should be extinguished. I expect an increase in the number of ships using the Sitrah Anchorage for bunkers and such ships should be able to leave in the dark if required. experiments in the United Kingdom have proved Yx iB possible to dim buoy lights successfully so thfr L3 ey are not viBlble above 1,500 feet under normal conditions, and in fact, the lights in the Shatt-al-Arab have already been treated in this manner, satisfactory# reports being received from pilots, ship masters and also from aerial observation. 3. The Port Director, Basrah, has been authorised by the Indian Government to proceed with the manufacture screens for all Gulf lights, which I have no aoubt will shortly be placed in position. It is not proposed to dim the Bahrain light vessel, arrangements haying already been made that same can be extinguished auickly in case of emergency. euxmicu I have the honour to be.

The question whether the light buoys round Bahrain should be extinguished has been the subject of voluminous correspondence in the past, to which the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, the Defence Officer, Bahrain, and the Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, have all made substantial contri butions. At one stage the matter also came before Colonel Prior - vide Residency Memorandum No.C/457 dated 10th November 3. My own inexpert view is that the extinguishing of the lights would impede friendly shipping far more than it would hinder hostile aircraft. The best solution of the problem seems to be that which has now been adopted - vide para 3 of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf’s letter No.157 dated 4th June 1942. £*'09 1940 Yours sincerely The Hon’ble Lieut.-Colonel W.R.Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf BushireSecret , No.C/813, Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th June 1942 To The Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.

C MSMOlUflDOM LS330N3 INVENT IK A.R.P. IT? QRAVT BRITAIN . !• (a) This Memorandum is a summary of the principal lessons learnt in Great Britain up to the end of January 1942 f as a result of air attacks on industrial centres and the oItII population. (b) This information has been obtained from the Inspector General of A.R.P., Ministry of Home Security, Great Britain. 2. The principal lessons learnt, above all else, are as follows:- (a) The paramount need for fire watching to tackle the incendiary bombs before they have had time to start a fire (b) The vital necessity for having very large supplies of static water readily available to cope with major fires. (c) The great importance of an efficient 'post blitz' organization to deal with the restoration of the situation and all the troubles of the population after a raid. (d) The vital importance of an efficient training organization. An A. R.P# 3taff School and Regional Training Schools have proved Invaluable in ensuring an adequate flow of trained A.R.P. Officers, Instructors, and personnel for the various services. 3. Fire Fighting and Fire Vat oiling . (a) Fire watchers are linked up with the Air Raid Wardens Service. (b) 'Block System' for fire watching in business premises is the most efficient. This was first adopted in Birmingham and has worked very well. The underlying principle is to have fire watchers and fire parties on duty in each block of premises, who are fully trained in the use of the stirrup hand pump and not only know the buildings for which they are responsible, but how to get about them in the dark. (o) The use of the jet and not the spray is advocated on almost all occasions when tackling an incendiary bomb by means of the stirrup hand pump. It is quicker in action and the spluttering does not matter as much as was thought at first.-2 *• Wattir 3m?ply , (a) The larger sis# of daias, holding anything up to a quarter of a raillion gallons of isater, are being installed in open spaces, basements and sites of blitzed houses. (b) The water mins failed badly in laost air attacks either on account of damge or owing to the large number of fire appliances trying to work from the mains and thereby reducing the pressure. (o) On account of (b) abore adequate static water is essential. 5. 'lost Blitz 1 * Organization . (a) This should be a separate organization from the operational side of A.R.F. in order to deal effectively with such questions as first aid repairs to houses, billetting, rest centres, emergency feeding, cooBnunal feeding and other problems which are the inevitable aftermath of an attack on the civil population. (b) The vital lesson learnt is to have a number of enquiry bureaux established at which all questions can be answered by responsible officials in a sympathetic and practical manner. There must be no question of pushing the unfortunate victims of an air raid from one Government Department to another in order to have their questions answered. (o) The temporary 'trekking problem' - Inevitable after heavy air attack - is best dealt with by the establishment of hutment camps where people oan get out and sleep and be brought back again for work in the morning. 6. Training . (a) Mobile reserves consisting of approximately 100 men are being trained as a combined A.H.P* itoroe under a Coacaan&amp;ant for First Aid, Keseue and Decontamination ork. ^ (b) This Force is primarily intended as a mobile reserve to re-inforce any place which is in trouble. It is a self contained unit with its own transport and equipment and under goes intensive training. (o) Inter Service training, i.e. training rescue, first aid and decontamination squads in each other*s work is being carried out. (d) Regional Training Schools train all A.H.P. personnel in their work including Fire Guards, in the administration and organisation of A.r,p. schemes and rescue parties in the new technique of tunnelling.—No •C/931 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 29th June 1942, To The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Bahrain* Dear Sirs The note of the Bahrain Air Raid Warning Siren is unfortunately identical with that of the siren on the launch used by your Company to convey passengers between Manama and Dhahran.

Reference to previous correspondence S.ZMinutes of a meeting of the Air Raid PrecautionCommittee held at the Adriserate at 10 A,M. on Tuesday the 8th September 1942* A meeting of the Air Raid Precautions Committee was held at the Adviserate on Tuesday the 8th Septoaber 1942 at 10 A.M© The following were present C. Dalrymple Belgrare, Esquire. (Adviser to the Govt) J. M. Campbell t Esquire. Haj Khalil bin Ibrahim Kanoo. Haj Yusuf Mahnood Hussain. Haj Hussain Tate earn. Haj Mohamed Saelh Shatter. Mr. K.P. Narayan (Secretary to the Adviser). The new air raid siren which was tried out on 17th \ August 1942 was discussed. The members said that it was neaid in some places in Manama and Moharraq but in certain places in Manama it was not heard. It was heard in the Port, also in the house of Haj Hussain Yateem. Haj Hussain suggested that the fire bells also could be sounded but the Committee did not come to any decision about the fire bells. The Adviser then put before the Committee that there was a suggestion that the siren should be blown every day during the month of Ramadhan. This would accustom the public to the sound of the siren and conserve the supply of gunpowder at present used for firing the guns. The gun powder is difficult to obtain now, it would also ensure that the siren was in working order. During Ramadhan over 130 bags of gunpowder is normally used. Haj Khalil Kanoo said that the guns would be more effective as they are heard in the villages. He suggested that perheps the even! gun could bo eliminated and replaced by the siren, but not the morning gun. The Committee unanimously agreed to the suggestion and requested the Adviser that a procla mation should be Issued to the public announcing that the siren instead of the gun would be heard every day at sunset. The Adviser suggested having an air raid practice at night during Ramadhan. He said In the last practice onlythe Police and Hospitals took part. In the coming practice all the public should be asked to participate. The Committee agreed that another air raid practice in which all the public participated would be useful but thought that air raid wardens would be needed to tell the public where to go and what to do. As no more ▼olunteers have come forward it was saggested that Pre sidents of the different clubs in Bahrain should be sent for and asked whether some of the members of their clubs would volunteer. Regarding the practice it was decided that the public who are outside on the roads and public places should be persuaded to go into the trenches. It was decided to have the practice on the niglit of 10th Ramadhan (night between 10th and 11th Ramadhan) as there would be moonlight. The trenches should be cleaned out. The time was fixed for 9.50 P.M. which would be just after the Ramadhan Taraweeh prayers. This being the first time that a public air raid practice is being held it was agreed that the public should be notified of the pub practice. Those in houses should be asked to remain in the houses and those outside to be directed to the trenches and shelters. All oars should be stopped. The Mvisor said that arran ements have been made to switch off all the Manama and Moharraq lights except those of the Hospitals. It was suggested that instead of a policeman or natur an air raid warden would be more useful at each trench or shelter and the policemen could patrol around and enforce the black-out especially in the coffee-shops where there are no electric lights. When it was suggested that complete black-out should henceforth be imposed Haj Khalil Kanoo said that owing to Ramadhan complete black-out should only be enforced after 9.30 It was agreed that the practice should be held in Moharraq as well as in Manama. The bridge should be leftopen for the traffic • The air raid wardens should c arry with them a locally made badge. The Adviser suggested that some of the local notables should be Invited to watch the practice. The Committee agreed and suggested that the Secretaries of both the Municipalities should be collect the members of the Municipalities and take them around walking. A policeman sho dd go with them in order that they should not be prevented from waMng to the shelters. Mr. J. M. Campbell suggested that after some progress lias been made in the matter of the practice, requests A should be made of the Royal Air Force for aa a R.A.F. plane to fly over Bahrain on practice nights. The plane would be i' able to spot places where the black-out is not rigidly observed. The Adviser said that the Royal Air Force Officers have suggested that some of the trenches in Bahrain are very long and had suggested that *f long trenches are dag they should be dug in a zig zag and not in a straight line. The Committee agreed and the Secretary of the Manama Muni cipality said that he would alter the long trenches accords ingly. Asked wfcefckea? what the response of the public was to the printed instructions for precautions during an air raid,\ Haj Hussain Yateem said that the public did not welcome the instructions but said that the Government was very pessimistic about air raids and was trying to excite the people. The Committee thought that the compaign to ©nlighter the public should continue. Mr. J. M. Campbell said that there were among his staff men who wished to join first aid vonlunteers. The Adviser replied that they would be welcome. The meeting came to a close at 11 A.M.Telegram S. From Thompson, Baghdad. To Political Bahrain. Mo.33/14. Dated 15th received 17th September 1942.

I have heard from the British Embassy at Baghdad that Professor Webster will be able to visit Bahrain, but can only stay here for a very short period. The dates of his visit are not yet known. Yours truly,1?&gt; An A • t .P, practice was held in Manama and Moharraq yesterday evening. The warning siren blew at 9.30, and all electric lights except those on the Cable Wirele^ circuit and in the Hospitals were turned off fr/m tfrfe main^ Mr. Belgrave, Major Hewitt, Squadron Leader Chase and I toured round Manama in Mr. Belgrave 1 s car. 2. The black-out was on the whole thorough, only two lit-up houses in Manama being observed, in addition to the Fort and surrounding buildings which emitted a modicum of light which would been vis itae from the air. I believe that the Club at Moharraq was delinquent in this respect. 3. There was not a single car to be seen apart from those of officials. Of the public, the large majority were indoors; the coffee-houses were full but had extinguished their lights. The trenches had few occupants and, though not many of the public were wandering about the streets, those that were there were apparently allowed to remain by the police instead of being shepherded into trenches. This was particularly so in the case of a crowd of young men collected in the road opposite the Technical School where there was to be a fire; the police only came and drove them into neighb™ 11 '*-’ +.r.«nr&gt;v,Qo Q-r+o-r. ^'■‘•awn their attention steps of their houses instead of being either inside t hem or in trenches. Otherv/ise the police and naturs went about their work with zeal and must have been quick off the mark (though of course fore-warned,) when the alarm sounded. 4. A bevy of members of the Manama Municipal Council and of the A.R.P. Committee witnessed the practice as spec tators by invitation. There are 12 A.R.P. wardens in Bah rain, who were in attendance but did not take any obvious part in the proceedings, perhaps because they wore no visible marks by which they could be distinguished. I understand that about two dozen more young men offered their services yesterday; though too late to be of use last night, they will doubtless be availed of now. The 'All Clear' sounded at 9.47 p.m., according to the state Uingineer who was in were on the door--2- charge of it: reports hov/ever conflict as to the time at which we in our car did not hear it. 5. Immediately after the 'All Clear', — why not before is not clear, — a bonfire was lit in front of the Technical School. The State's two fire engines (one is in charge of the State Engineer and the other of the Municipality,) in due course arrived, — though not until the fire was beginning to . ander the orders of the State the man nearest us found a diversity of objects at which to *tra4n his hose, — successively over the top of the fire, doubtless with the intention of hitting his comrades on the other side, then on the fire and then on the hither side of it, presumably in order to s top it spreading. Throughout the fire what I took to be fire-bells con tinued to ring from somev/here behind us; what the object was in their J doing so after the fire-engines had arrived I did not discover. j 6. After the fire had burnt out, we went to the medical aid post in front of the Customs House. The all-clear having sounded, a considerable crowd had gathered to see the fun. This, with the ululations that echoed in considerable number round the squar:, which I did not trace to their source but presumably came from the injured and bereaved, g^ave a suitable atmosphere, of confusion, in which well- trained stretcher-bearers (members of the Band) and realistic casual ties played their part well. Drs. 3now and Iteele were on duty, supervising the disposal of casualties, some of whom recovered with miraculous rapidity and were allov/ed to proceed home, either with or without first-aid treatment, while others were taken to the Government! and Mission Hospitals. We went on in due course to the Government Hospital, but the patients had been sent home, having completed their role. 7. The following points come to notice they were reported not to have been heard at the 'ort. Ihey were, hov/ever, apparently heard throughout Moharraq. (b) A certain number of the police were mounted. Mounted police would certainly not, 1 think, be a practica/' ^sition in the Engineer^ ^Lest they should get there before it was properly under weigh). The firemen set about extinguishing the flames. We were not sufficiently near to v/atch their individual activities in detail; (a) The sirens were not, I believe, audible throughout Manama;-3- (244 confusion of a real air-raid. (c) 'Those entitled to be in cars should have a control light put on the front of their car, so as not to be stopped by the police (as we were frequently). The A.L.C. is having one fitted to his. This practice was useful as a start, but the next one should be more realistic, with aeroplanes taking part and some kind of fireworks let off and v/ith less notice in / advanc e•Telegram 3.

Should there be any reason for complaint about messages of this type in future I should be obliged if thejcomplaint could be made to me or to the State Engineer at once, not five days later. Special calls such as fire and Air Raid alarms are logged by the operator but no record is kept of ordinary calls so it is difficult for the operators to give any details of a normal call several days after the call took place.

The H.Ci. is informed by the R.a.F. that a test flight v/as made on 25/26 Sept., over the CASCO refinery at DHaHRaN to observe the general blackout conditions. Two members of CaSCO staff were in the aircraft at the time. 2. The bright light issuing from the burners, disposing of waste field gases was visible from 26 - 31 kilometres away. In the event of air raids, this would undoubtedly be of great assistance to enemy bombers. / 3. At Kirkuk and Bahrain the flares have been eliminated by piping the gases away and dispersing them in the open air. 4. It would be appreciated if CASCO could be approached on this matter with the object of adopting similar measures at _ DHaHR/lN in order to dispense with the flares. LHL/MANI. (Sgd:) J.S.

Col. J. S. Judd, C.G.S., to Mr* H. S. Bowlby. The only feasible means of dispensing with the burning of the waste gas flares will require the erection of a steel derrick on the high jebel and the installation of two large diameter pipe lines to disperse the high pressure field gases and stabilizer plant and tank vapors into the open air* This method is estimated to cost approximately $15,000. Also, it will require the use of considerable large diameter pipe. Our supply of pipe is very limited, and may well be required for some other more essential war effort. We are, as always, anxious to cooperate fully, but it occurs to us that in view of the favorable change in the general war situation, Lt* Col. Judd may wish to withhold his suggestion that we take remedial steps at this time.

I referred the matter to Colonel Hewitt who states that he has no objection to the proposed change if you can guarantee that (a) a complete black-cut can be ro-started at £4 hours* notice, and T.hat (b) a partial black-out can be imposed at short notice. 2 . will you please let me know whether you are able to give this guarantee V if you have any doubt about the signi ficance of the terms 'complete black-out 11 and 'partial black out', I suggest that you ascertain exactly what is required direct from Colonel Hewitt.

Sir: Bahrein Island. Persian Gulf. llth May, 1943. A R25TEERY BLACKOUT A T.Trs 'n. / Please refer to your confidential letter No/C/632 dated May 10th 1943 regarding possible shortening of the hours of blackout in the Refinery. The Company is able to give the desired guarantee. The nightly blackout of lights at 11.00 p.m. will serve as a check on the efficiency of the blackout and the speed of extinguishment. We anticipate the blackout can be imposed in a few minutes time. Unless you have an objection, I suggest that the term 'refinery' be made to include Sitrah terminal, Zellaq facilities, and the field installations. None of these installations are any more vital than the refinery proper. Since speaking with you on this subject, a point of minor importance has come to my attention. The shifts at the refinery change at 11.00 p.m. It would be a bit more convenient if the blackout started at say 11.30 p.m. This would have the advantage of avoiding the work of extinguish ment of lights right at shift change time and would allow the new shift a few minutes in which to look things over with benefit of lights before the blackout started. This point however is of relatively minor importance and if it were to cause delay in obtaining approval, it can be disregarded. W. P.

Political Agent, BahrainObservation of blackout measures from r,ircrHift on the evenihg of the 8th January, 1941. I made a short flight in an Royal Air Force aircraft on the evening of the 8th January 1941, between 6 p.m. and 7.45 p.m. to observe the effect of blackout measures in Jahrain. 8. Before going up in the aeroolane I discussed the observation .eir.h the Air liaison officer and he was anxious that I should observe :— (a) Muharraq and Kanamah from above and from 3 or 4 miles distance. (b) The oil refinery and camp. 3. There were a few strong lights in 1 ananah although I was not sufficiently acquainted with the layout of the town to be able to say where they were situated on the ground, one very bright light in or near I'anamah or 'uharraq was visible from Awall. Vhen approached from the direction of the sea flights in Fanamah were visible from a distance which I estimated at from 2 to 3 miles. 4. The position of oil refinery was ap arent so* n after leaving the air field at Tuharraq because large flames either from a furnace or of escaping gas were burning. These were extinguished as the aircraft approached Awali. 5. The refinery in Awali was clearly visible from a distance of 1 to 2 miles as there were two bright lights \ showing on or near the roof of what , poeared to be the nain building. There were also many chinks of light sho ing all over the building which showed a broad band of light points which would appear to delineate the position of the building. The affect of lights covered from above shining through open doorways or verandahs does not appear to have been appreciated These are visible from aircraft approaching the light'*' b ilding. There was also r^e'bright light visible which•which appeared to be an incompletely covered furnace. a The dunmy refinery was visible but was not such/conspicuous target as the main building of the refinery itself. 6. The oil camp at Awali was well blacked out.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00005c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/699</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00005c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/699</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 28/13 Black out and A.R.P.
