The head is beautifully modeled with great freedom and suggests a strong Mycenaean influence. A cord runs to the cow's head from the right and on the upper right corner of the block there is part of some floral decoration also in sunken relief. Very slight traces of red paint on the background. The disk between the cow's horns is only a semicircle possibly indicating that the piece was never completed. The stone is unusually soft. \r\nCondition: There are minor chips on the cow\u2019s face. The part including her horns and disk was apparently found separately and reattached.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "9 x 5 1/8 x 11 13/16 in.
