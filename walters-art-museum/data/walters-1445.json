The codex was written in nastaʿlīq in black ink by Ibn Sayyid Murād al-Ḥusaynī and illustrated by Muḥammad ʿAlī Mashhadī in 1068 AH / 1657 CE. According to the colophon, Ibn Sayyid Murād al-Ḥusaynī copied the manuscript for the painter Muḥammad ʿAlī, the “Mani of the time,” as a “souvenir.” The fact that the manuscript was produced for one of the most prolific artists of seventeenth-century Iran makes it a highly significant document. It opens with an illuminated incipit with headpiece (fol. 1b) and closes with an illuminated tailpiece with colophon (fol. 21b). Text pages have interlinear illumination and small rectangular and triangular pieces with polychrome floral and scrolling vine motifs. There are eight miniatures in a style associated with the Safavid centers of artistic production of Mashhad and Isfahan (fols. 5a, 9a, 10b, 13a, 14a, 16a, 17b, and 19b).", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/80060", "Keywords": "Islamic; Mughal; Persian; Safavid; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Colophon; Illumination; Illustration; Manuscript; India; Iran", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore; by bequest to Walters Art Museum, 1931.", "Dynasty": "Safavid Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Muhammad Riza Naw'i Khabushani (died 1019 AH/AD 1610)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.19b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.19b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.19b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.19b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.19b_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CPS_W.649.19b_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
