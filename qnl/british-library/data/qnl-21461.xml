The Political Situation in Mesopotamia. The political situation in Baghdad and Mesopotamia is intimately connected with that in the Persian Gulf. During the 19th century the British gradually built up for themselves a special position in the Persian Gulf and in Lower Mesopotamia. Great Britain undertook and maintained single-handed: — 1. The suppression of the slave-trade and piracy. 2. The preservation of peace and the development of trade in the Persian Gulf. 3. The opening up of the Tigris and Euphrates to navi gation. 4. The survey of the coasts and rivers and the production of navigation charts, sailing directions, etc. At the end of the 19th century the British occupied a para mount position at Baghdad and held practically a monopoly of the navigation of the Tigris. Almost the whole of the trade of these regions was in British hands. In 1910, 87 per cent, of the trade of the Persian Gulf was still British. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, great changes have come about—changes so great that our position at Baghdad has been seriously challenged. The main factors which have produced these changes have been the building of the Baghdad Railway and the advent to power of the Young Turkish Party. In 1908 the Young Turkish Party rose to power and embark- Intrigues &lt;?d on a policy m the Baghdad region and in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait -Turkish petty annoyances . which was most markedly aggressive and inimical to British interests. Although in 1901 the Turkish Government had agreed to recognise the status quo in the Persian Gulf, it now proceeded to intrigue with the Shaikh of Kuwait, and tried by many offers to induce him to accept Turkish nationality. The Shaikh, however, stood loyally by his agreements of 1899 and 1907 with the British Government. Intrigues Turkish intrigues against the Shaikh of Muhammareh of M'uhammu- 1 culminated in open use of force in April 1910, but this affair was reh. tided over. Not content with this the Turks pursued an aggressive policy in the Qatar peninsula and the Trucial coast, occupied the island of Zakhnuniyah, and even went so far as to put forward shadowy claims over the 'Oman peninsula, Masqat, and even Gwadar on the Baluchistan coast. These intrigues were coincident with the efforts of Germany to strengthen her commercial position in the Persian Gulf. Nearer home the Turks seized every pretext to pick a quarrel with the British. The Turks objected to the use of the British flag on the two original Tigris steamers belonging to Messrs. Lynch and Com pany, and at Baghdad itself took exception to the following existing British privileges : —• (t) The sepoy guard on the British Residency. (u) The presence of the R. I. M. S. “ Comet ” flying the British flag, for the special use of the Resident. (in') The size of the British Residency and grounds at Baghdad. &gt; -^ n August 1910 the offices of Messrs. Lynch and of Messrs. ’Abdul ’Ali (a British Indian firm) were demolished on a false pretext of danger to the public, in order to avoid the payment of compensation. In September 1910 British Indian property at Khadimain and Karbala was similarly demolished. Improvement The attitude of the Turks towards foreigners in general, and o h i&lt;&gt; t ' to iu particular, underwent a verv marked change tirade, 1912. for the good j n 1912&gt; ' 5 Balkan ar. The defeat of Turkey in the Balkans also greatly changed the political situation, for the rise of a strong Balkan'hegemony Twhilst it weakened Turkey in Europe, also had the effect of bar ring to Germany the direct road to Constantinople and Turkey in Asia, wilich, rumour had it some years ago, Germany intend ed to colonise. Turkey’s defeat in the Balkans led to widespread lawlessness in 1912 in the Muntafik country and in Kurdistan, in which province the outbreaks were said to have been fostered by the Bussians. ' Another result of the weakening of the Central Government Committee of was the decline in popular favour of the Committee of Union ^ccord m an&lt;1 and Progress and the founding at Baghdad, in January 1912, ‘ r of a local branch of the Committee of Freedom and Accord, which was opposed to the former. In Basrah the anti-Turkish feeling had been still more marked. Arab Move- In June 1918 the Turkish Commandant of Troops was assassi- raen t. nated by Arabs, and it was feared that there would be a general Arab rising. Disturbances continued in Basrah till March 1914, but the rising did not come to a head. The execution of part of Sir William Willcocks’ irrigation irrigation in scheme for Mesopotamia was entrusted to Sir John Jackson Mesopotamia, and Company. The first section of this scheme, the construc tion of the Hindiyah barrage, was completed in December 1913. Neighbouring Principalities. The following short history of neighbouring tracts affords an insight into political relations of the Turks with their neigh bours. Kuwait. _ Kuwait is a tract of country of somewhat uncertain bound aries directly administered by the Shaikh. He has independ ently contracted obligations from time to time with the British Government, and this, the latter maintain, he is quite justified in doing; the Turks, on the other hand, do not admit this. . The family of the present Shaikh, Jabir ibn Mubarak, originally dwelt in a small fort called Umm Qasr, at the head of the Khor Abdulla, whence, on account of acts of piracy, they were expelled by the authorities at Basrah at the end of the4 seventeenth century, with the result that they moved down to Kuwait Bay. For the succeeding two centuries, the history of Kuwait is mainly concerned with tribal alliances or feuds, into which the influence of the Wahabi* rulers from Riyadh or Hail entered from time to time, and it was not until 1871 that any direct con tact with the Ottoman Empire first commenced. In that year ’Abdullah bin Faisal, the ruler of Najd, appealed to Midhat Pasha, the Wali of Baghdad, for assistance against ’Abdullah’s brother Sa’ud, who had possessed himself of A1 Qatar and Qatif, then under the rule of the Amirs of Najd. Sa ud had also, in the harbours of these localities, seized certain Kuwait ships and had returned an evasive answer to the remonstrances of the then Shaikh of Kuwait. As a result of a conference between the Wali and the Shaikh, it was decided that they would co-operate with ’Abdullah against Sa’ud. The latter was de feated and according to the Turkish account, the Shaikh placed himself under Turkish control, assumed the Ottoman flag and, bv accepting the title of Pasha, acknowledged henceforth a certain subjection to Turkey. According to the Kuwait con tention, however, the Shaikh was merely granted the title of Pasha in return for services rendered, at the same time receiving grants of land in the neighbourhood of Fao, and a grant of money which was paid regularly until 1898. Kuwait now flies a flag of its own. From 1871 onwards to 1897, the question of the sovereignty of Kuwait arose in various forms, mainly on the general point of the repression of piracy on the Gulf Coast by British ships. In April 1897, Shaikh Mubarak failed in an endeavour to obtain from Turkey a recognition of independence, upon which he preferred a definite request for British protection. The British Government were at first not disposed to interfere, but in 1899 action was precipitated by the report of a Russian railway concession in Kuwait with the result that certain arrangements were entered into with the Shaikh. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the Shaikh had accepted the Turkish designation of Qaim-Maqam,t which might perhaps be held to Tepresent the * A puritanical Moslem sect started by ’Abdul Wahab of Basrah, which spread over the Arabian desert of Najd and the Nafud, and embraced the Jabal Shammar country to the north-east. f Head of a qadha (administrative division of country in the Ottoman dominions).holding of office under the Turkish Government, but this was 1 explained as merely incidental to the possession of the Turkish property at Fao by the Shaikh. Subsequently a more difficult question arose through the endeavour of the Turks to appoint a harbour official at Kuwait; this led to a remonstrance from the British Government, and the subsequent removal of the official by the Turks. In the beginning of 1900, the first rumours arose as to the Baghdad railway project, and as it was reported that the German promoters would negotiate directly with the Sultan, for a con cession of land in Kuwait Harbour to use as a terminus, without regard to the Shaikh, the British Government announced that, while they did not desire to interfere with the status quo or with the Sultan’s authority iij those -parts, they could not, having regard to their great interests in the Persian Gulf, view with indifference any action which would alter the existing condition of affairs or give another Power special rights or privileges over territory belonging to the Shaikh, with whom His Majesty’s Government had certain agreements. As a result probably of this attitude no mention was made in the subsequent railway convention as to any definite terminal port, but other events during 1901 and 1902 raised the Kuwait question to a somewhat acute stage. In 1901, the Shaikh attacked the Amir of Najd and the latter appealed to the Ottoman Government, -which thereupon mani fested an intention of despatching troops to Kuwait. This was resisted by the British Government which announced its reso lution to oppose by force any landing of troops in Kuwait terri tory. It was within a few weeks of this incident that Mubarak himself having asked for the presence of addPion&amp;l ships in the harbour, an official from Basrah visited Kuwait and informed the Shaikh that his assertion of independence was disapproved of by the Sultan, and that punishment must ensue if he did not make his submission. To this communication, Mubarak, after consultation with the Senior Naval Officer, replied that his relations with the Turkish Government were the same as they had always been, and*later, upon representation by our Am . bassador at Constantinople, the action of the Basrah official was disavowed.A more peremptory summons was, however, issued later in the year, which resulted in the Shaikh stating that he would have no option but to comply unless he'was assured of British support. He was informed that the British Government would not tolerate any attack upon him by land or sea, and the Senior Naval Officer again received instructions to defend Kuwait, by force if necessary. To complicate matters further Ibn Rashid (prob ably instigated by the Turkish officials at Basrah), advanced towards Kuwait town, whereupon a provisional scheme of land defences was drawn up by the Senior Naval Officer, in con junction with the Shaikh, and some machine-guns and blue jackets were landed. The threatened attack, however, passed off, and the Porte again disavowed the action of its officials, only, however, during the next year, 1903, to occupy various more or less debatable points on the Kuwait boundaries with small posts of troops, i.e., Safwan, Bubiyan Island, Umm Qasr, and Warbah Island. The Turkish Government still exercises a certain pressure upon the Shaikh, presumably owing to his possessing private property at Fao and Basrah, but between the years 1903 and 1910 there was little to record in the way of interference with the rather vague “status quo” which has been already alluded to. The conception of this status quo, and the manner in which the question is now regarded by His Majesty’s Government, was stated by Sir E. Grey in the House of Commons on March 9th, 1911, in a debate concerning the new arrangements in contempla tion for the construction of the Baghdad-Persian Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway. His words were: “We are not anxious to disturb the status quo in the Persian Gulf. To a great extent that status quo has been built up by us in previous genera tions. We have practically opened the Persian Gulf to trade and kept it open. That has been a matter of historical knowledge for years past. We are not anxious to have a forward policy in the Persian Gulf, to acquire new territory, or to disturb the status- quo; but if the status quo is going to be disturbed by others, then we must undoubtedly use our resources to maintain the position we have in the Persian Gulf. Part of the status quo is that we have entered into treaty obligations with the Shaikh of Kuwait and in any negotiations which there may be, or in any changes, which may take place, it is an obligationpf honour with us to see that our treaty obligations towards the Shaikh of Kuwait in maintaining his position are fulfilled.”In 1914 this and other points of variance were on the point of being amicably settled. Al Hasa. South of Kuwait we come to the so-called “ Turkish ” pro vince of Al Hasa. This comprises the fertile district of Al Hasa proper, with its port of ’Oqair, the coast town and district of Qatif, and tire fortified port of Al Bida’ (Dohah) on the eastern shore of the Qatar peninsula. It thus stretches from Kuwait south-east towards the country of the trucial Chiefs, and inland to the frontiers of Najd, and is often all described by the name of Al Hasa. Recent History and Present Politics. Turkish rule in Hasa, which had extended without interrup tion for 42 years from the occupation of Midhat Pasha in 1871, was ended in 1913 by Bin Sa’ud, Amir of Najd, who on May 5th seized Hofuf without much fighting, and soon afterwards took Qatif. The Turkish garrison withdrew first to Oqair, then to Bahrein, whence, with the troops from Qatif, it finally sailed to Basrah. Amirs were appointed by Bin Sa’ud in Hofuf and Qatif, and at a meeting at Oqair with Captain Shakespear, the British Political Agent from Kuwait, in 1913, the Amir announced that these officials were instructed to help and protect British sub jects in consultation with the Agent. In June 1914 Bin Sa’ud accepted the title of Wali of Najd and Hasa from the Ottoman Government, but he continued to invite closer relations with the Indian Government, and on Captain Shakespear’s appoint ment as Political Officer in Najd, later in the same year, he re ceived the British representative with cordiality. On the outbreak of the European War, he opposed Bin Rashid, who had espoused Turkish interests in Arabia, and fought a drawn battle with him near Majma in Sadair, in March 1915; but in the summer of the same year a formal peace was concluded between the two Amirs. Bin Sa’ud can summon to his standard the ’Ajman, Beni Khalid, and Beni Hajar, and to his control over these tribes is due the improvement in the security of the Hasa province and the caravan routes by which it is approached. The hostility of the Bedouin to the Turks had been such that the sovereignty of the Sultan extended no further than the effective8 power of the garrisons and military or police posts, while life and property were insecure even in the neighbourhood of Hofuf. Under the Porte, the whole region of Hasa, known as the Sanjaq of Najd, formed a division of the Basrah vilayat. The capital was Hofuf, and the country was administered on the usual Turkish system, though the government approximated to the nature of a military occupation. Subsidies were paid to the ’Ajman, Beni Hajar, Beni Khalid, and Ahl Murreh tribes,, who provided carriers of the official mails, and rafik for their escort. The garrison, chiefly concentrated at Hofuf and Qatlf. consisted of 4 battalions of infantry and 2 squadrons of cavalry r with one mule-battery, and a small auxiliary camel-corps of Arabs. Id addition, there were 6 companies of Dhab'ituyahz, 4 of which were mounted. The revenue was chiefly obtained from agriculture, more especially date-cultivation, a tax being imposed on dates in Qatif, while in Hasa the Government took a share of the corps. The amount thus obtained was estimated at nearly £25,000; customs were farmed, and are said to have yielded as much again. There were no public posts or tele graphs. Najd. Najd was, during the early part of the 18th century, the cenrtre of the extensive Wahabi empire, which extended from Mecca to near Baghdad. Originally ruled by one Amir residing at Riyadh it gradually became split up by the intrusion of a Shammar prince from the north, and, after various alterations of power, it has now become resolved into two main zones of influence, i.e., that centering round Hail to the north, and that centering round Riyadh to the south. At Hail the ruling .power is the Shammar dynasty of Ibn Rashid; at Riyadh the original Wahabi dynasty of Bin Sa’ud is predominant. Though, from the fact that they have at various periods undertaken military movements into these regions, the Turks profess to regard both the ruling Amirs as tributary to the Ottoman authority at Basrah, there is no doubt that whatever vestige of Turkish authority there may have been at any time has now completely disappeared, and that both states enjoy an altogether independent status. The first appearance of the Turks was in 1818, whenMuhammad ’Ali from Egypt, acting under instructions from the Porte, undertook a successful expedition against the Wahabi power. His garrisons remained there until 1831, when they were driven from the country. The next incident occurred in 1871, when, as already related. Midhat Pasha, the Wali of Baghdad, supported one of the claim ants to the Amirate, and obtained possession of the province of A1 Hasa, which at that time belonged to the Wahabi power. Recent History and present Politics. All Najd acknowledges at present the Sa’ud dynasty of Riyadh in Aridh. Its jurisdiction is enforced directly by accredited representatives in Aridh, Sadair, and probably 'Kharj, and also in parts of Aflaj, Washm, Qasim (e.g., Bureida) and probably Kharik: indirectly in the other parts of these latter districts, in the towns of Aneiza and Majma, and probably in Salaiyil and Dauasir. Each town has its Amir or governor and its mejliss or council, but only in Aneiza of Qasim have we heard of the council having much power. Hereditary Amirs are not uncommon even in directly administered districts, and they seem to be the rule in the outlying quarters of the south, where, as in parts of Washm also, the settlements are free except for a tributary obligation. The present power of Riyadh suffered eclipse at the hands of the Shammar Amirs of Hail from the middle of the eighties of last century until 1902, the representatives of the Sa’ud family being reduced after 1891 to puppets, while Rashidite governors took charge of all the important settlements in Qasim, Sadair, Aridh, and Washm. This state of things was terminated by Abdul Aziz Bin Sa’ud, who had remained in exile at Kuwait with his father, Abdurrahman, until he heard that his uncle, the mediatized Amir, had been murdered by Bin Rashid’s orders. With only about forty followers he appeared in Sadair, raised part of that district and marched on Aridh, where he had no difficulty in surprising and removing the Rashidite governor of Riyadh. His father stood aside and accepted his son as Amir. Acknowledged by all the southern provinces, Abdul Aziz marched on Qasim in 1904, and though forced to retire thence by a Turkish force sent under Ahmad Faizi Pasha to co-operate with the Amir of Hail, he returned in 1906, and has held that district to tribute, and partially in direct subjection,ever since, but not without frequent skirmishes with the forces of Jabal Shammar. In 1910 he had to meet both an internal and an external danger. Certain grandsons of his late uncle, Sa’ud, claiming the throne for the elder branch, tried to raise Kharj and Harik. At the same time Abdullah, the son of the Grand Sherif, appeared in Qasim, professing to champion rights of the Ateiba violated by Abdul Aziz. The latter’s younger brother, Saad, his representative in Qasim, was made prisoner; but finding that the Amir of Hail, who had lately made peace with Abdul Aziz, did not co-operate, Abdullah retired stipulat ing that the Qasim towns contribute to the Meccan treasury a sum of £4,000 annually (the larger towns had previously paid such ‘ Peter’s pence ’ voluntarily), and be free to elect their own governors. Abdul Aziz assented to these terms. The southern rebels had no success, and after being driven from town to town, fled out of Najd. For harbouring some of them, Abdul Aziz inflicted heavy punishment on the Ataiba a year later, in viola tion of his convention with the Sherif. Hard pressed for re sources he had been coveting Hasa, which before 1871 per tained to his dynasty, and he had tried, without much success, to enlist the support of the Indian Government, seeking to revive an agreement which had subsisted between his uncle, the Amir Abdullah, and ourselves in regard to Gulf matters. The Balkan war and the internal dissensions of the Bin Rashid house at last offered him an opportunity, and the presence of rebel grandsons of Sa’ud at Hofuf, an excuse: and early in 1913 he descended on Hasa, captured the central oasis, and ten days later, Qatlf. He sent the Turkish governor and garri son down to Ojair, whence they made their way into el-Katr. At the end of that year he had a conference with two repre sentatives of the Indian Government, and, after a show of nego tiating with the Ottoman Power and accepting the title “ Wali of Najd,” he invited a British agent to his court, and declared for us and against Bin Rashid, the ally of the Turks. The latter advanced early in 1915 into Sadair, but retired after fighting a drawn battle near Majma, in the course of which our newly arrived agent, Captain Shakes|5ear, was unfortunately killed. In the early autumn the Grand Sharif, who shelters the rebel grandsons of Sa’ud, again sent up Abdullah, with a considerable force, to mediate between the two Amirs and at the same time to enforce the pact of 1910, especially its financial clause. A peace was patched up (it has not been very faithfully observed), and the Sharif’s son retired, leaving some soreness behind.British position in the Gulf generally. s British interests are closely concerned with the regulation of the Gulf in general. The following words defining the British standpoint are quoted from a speech delivered by Viscount Morley (Acting Secretary of State for India), in the House of Lords, on 22nd March, 1911: — ‘ £ If by any chance in negotiation our position in the Gulf is challenged this is the answer. That position has been described as unique. Great Britain ‘ has not sought territorial acquisi tion in these regions. She has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere except in the capacity of Sovereign. She has had duty thrust on her without dominion. She has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects; has patrolled during upwards of two centuries waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship. She has kept in strange ports an open door, through which traders of every nation may have as free access to distant markets as her own. If Great Britain has become in any sense arbiter and guardian of the Gulf, it has not been through any restless ambition urging her on to the control of the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to calls that have been made on her in the past to enforce peace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, and to hold back the arm of the marauder.’ That is our charter. It gives a true picture of our historical position. It is owing to British enterprise, the expenditure of British lives and treasure, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world, and to this cause alone it may be said that the seaborne trade of these regions owes its very existence.” In 1914, when -war broke out, the- British and Turkish Gov ernments were on the point of signing an agreement settling all the disputed points regarding the status of Kuwait, the Baghdad Railway and Navigation of the Shatt-al-’Arab. The terms of the agreement had been unde# discussion for over a year, and each subject had been patiently threshed out. Outline of the operations of British Forces up to May 20th, 1916. War with Turkey was declared on October 81st, 1914, at which time the situation at the head of the Persian Gulf was as follows:— There was a British force of a Brigade and two12 mountain batteries under General Delamain on transports off Bahrain Island, as a precaution against a surprise attack by the Turks on the Oil Fields in ’Arabistan. To oppose this the Turks could, it was estimated, put in the field at the least some 8,000 men and 32 guns of their Basrah troops, not includ ing any reinforcements which might have come from Baghdad. As regards the Arab tribes, the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muham- mareh and Ibn Sa’ud, the great Chieftain of Central Arabia, were on our side, while Ibn Rashid, the Ruler of Hail, and the Shaikhs of the Muntafik and Bani Lam tribes of Mesopotamia had ranged themselves with the Turks. The Wali of Pusht-i- Kuh and the Bakhtiari Khans were maintaining a neutral attitude. On November 6th a landing was effected almost without opposition at Fao, at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab. The mam disembarkation, which took place at Saniyah above, and on the opposite bank to, the Oil Company’s Refinery at ’Abba- dan, was completed by November 10th. On November 14th General Barrett arrived with reinforcements and took over command. Our force then began offensive operations. Basrah was formally occupied on November 23rd after combined naval and military _ operations along the Shatt-al-’Arab, in which the principal action was that of Zain, where the enemy’s losses C u me -D to over ^’MO- A proclamation was read announcing that Basrah had passed for ever out of the hands of the Turks'? Operations were then undertaken against a Turkish force at Qurnah under Subhi Bey, Wali of Basrah, who surrendered on December 9th with over 1,000 men and four guns. In January, 1915, some 5,000 Turks and Arabs established themselves at Rotah Creek, 6 miles above Qurnah, but on the left hand bank of the Tigris. At this time the Turkish forces were disposed in three areas —on the Euphrates, Tigris, and Karun. The main force of the enemy was concentrated on the Euphrates, whence they made a determined, but unsuccessful, attack on us at Sha’aibah on March 16th. It was found that the enemy was bringing supplies down by river, so a “ blockade ” was carried out by means of heavy guns on rafts which were pushed forward to fire on the landing places. This proved most successfuL On April 9th Sir John Nixon took over com mand of the Force. From April 12th there was continuous fighting, which culminated on April 14th in the defeat of theenemy at Barjisiyah with a loss, estimated at 6,000. The enemy fled at Khamissiyyah, nearly 90 miles away, harassed in their flight by the Arabs their former allies. It may be remarked that the Arabs hand is always against the loser, and his wish is to be left alone, a law unto himself. He disliked the Turkish rule of oppression, and would equally dislike our idea of law and order. The force on the Karun threatened the Oil Fields, and for that reason and to support the Shaikh of Muhammareh, whose tribesmen were giving trouble, a British Force was sent to Ahwaz. By the end of May, after a series of operations, suc cessfully executed under severe climatic and physical difficulties, the Turks were forced back on to the Tigris line. It was then decided to operate against their concentration on the Tigris. In spite of great difficulties caused by the flooded state of the country, the enemy’s position was successfully attacked, and after our troops had covered about 90 miles in less than four days, the town of ’Amarah was occupied on June ■3rd. On June 18th the 12th Brigade (less one battalion) reached ’Amarah by land from the direction of Ahwaz. The next operation was the occupation of Nasiriyah, a town of great strategic importance at the junction of the Euphrates and the Shatt-al-Hai, which connects the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This was accomplished on July 25th after nearly three weeks of fighting under the most trjdng conditions of climate and terrain against an enemy who made a stubborn resistance. The enemy’s losses amounted to some 2,500 men and 15 guns. On October 2nd it was reported that there were no enemy troops left in the Euphrates area. In order to improve our strategical position and more effect ually to prevent any movement of the enemy in the direction of Persia, it became necessary to seize and hold Kut-al-Amarah. On September 28th a successful attack was made and the enemy fled towards Baghdad with heavy losses. Unfortunately effective pursuit was impossible owing to difficulties of naviga tion. The enemy rallied at Ctesiphon. After concentrating at ’Aziziyah, the British forces under General Townshend moved forward against the Turkish position at Ctesiphon and on November 22nd captured that position. However large reinforcements having reached the enemy, GeneralTownshend was compelled to fall back, and from November 25th to December 3rd be retreated on Kut-al-Amarah, which was invested by the enemy on December 7th. The operations in the early part of 1916 were mainly directed to the relief of Kut-al-Amarah. On January 7th the battle of Shaikh Sa’ad was fought by the relieving force and the position captured. This success was followed by the battle of Orah (or Wadi) on January 13th and 14th and the capture of the enemy’s position at that place. On January 21st came the battle of Umm-al- Hannah. The enemy were now in a strong position at Es- Sinn. An unsucessful attack on the Dujailah redoubt—a portion of this position—was made on March 8th and 9th. On April 5th the British carried the Hannah Falahiyah posi tions (near Umm-al-Hannah) and on April 9th attacked the Sannaiyat position about 3 miles west of Umm-al-Hannah. An advance on the right bank of the Tigris resulted in the capture of the enemy’s position at Bait ’Aiessa and an enemy counter-attack upon that position was repulsed with some loss. Floods now impeded the further advance of the relieving force and on April 29th the garrison of Kut-al- Amarah, having exhausted all their provisions, capitulated. On May 20th the Dujailah redoubt and Es-Sinn positions were occupied by the British.CHAPTER H. GEOGRAPHY. Boundaries. The tract of country to be dealt with in this report com prises the locality commonly known as Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia as a whole is the lowland portion of the basin of the ancient Asiatic rivers Euphrates and Tigris, in contradis tinction to the Armenian and Kurdistan hill country, which forms the high-lying portion of the basin, the dividing line between the two being found in the neighbourhood of Diarbekr. Mesopotamia itself can again be subdivided into Upper and Lower Mesopotamia, the former, Al Jazirah (the island between two rivers) extending south as far as Baghdad, and the latter, ’Iraq-i-’Arabi continuing to the Persian Gulf. Our boundaries then for this report are Upper Mesopotamia, similar in character to Lower Mesopotamia on the north, and the Persian Gulf on the south. The eastern boundary is the Turco-Persian frontier, which was demarcated in 1914. The approximate line, emer ging from the watershed of a belt of high mountains east of Baghdad, runs along the foothills about 40 miles east of the Tigris to a little west of Muhammareh, where Persian terri tory adjoins the Shatt-al-’Arab. As regards the country on the west, we have the Arabian tableland, rising very gradually from the lowland, Euphrates country and without any definite line 'of demarcation between the- authority of the Turkish Government and the spheres of the various independent or /semi-independent Arab tribes and chieftains. Geographical peatures. Between this western desert tableland, rising to 1,000 feet at about 100 miles from the Euphrates, and the Persian hills on the east, nowhere is the country more than 100 feet above sea-level, and the whole Mesopotamian zone may be regarded as a northern extension of the Persian Gulf, which at one time probably reached almost to the Mediterranean. The country has in fact gradually been filled in by the alluvia of the great rivers and the advancing sands of the desert, and owing to this i ( 15 )I 16 geological origin, the soil is found everywhere to consist of a sandy clay, abounding in excellent agricultural properties and incapable of cultivation only where water fails. Its astounding fertility is sufficiently shown by the fact that it still remains unexhausted after having supported the teeming populations^ of the Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian Empires and that Sir William Willcocks is of opinion that, if a proper system of irrigation control is once more put into force, the country can have in front of it a future of prosperity equal to that which it enjoyed in ancient days. At the present time, owing to the want of suitable control over the water and to the inertia of the inhabitants, the land so favourable for agriculture _ is, comparatively speaking, little cultivated, and the population relies mainly on the produce of its flocks and herds for which there is good grazing in sprino r even in the so-called desert country. The main features of the region are the two rivers Euphrates J and Tigris, which, together with their valleys-, will be alluded to / m detail later. These rivers approach fairly close to one an- other at Baghdad, and then turn apart to unite finally at Gurmat 'Ah, below Qurnah. From Qurnah downwards the stream is known as the Shatt-al-’Arab. The junction used to be at Qurnah, and the old channel of the Euphrates is still in existence, though the banks are for the most part destroyed and no Euphrates water enters the Tigris from it. Between Baghdad and Qurnah the main streams are connected by several channels and intermittent water-courses, of which the chief are the Nabr 1 Isa or Sakhlawiyah Canal (closed at its head on the Euphrates)- and the Shatt-al-Hai. Around Qurnah and between Wnarah and that place there are extensive marshes, but below Qurnah. the Shatt-al-’Arab traverses a flat and fertile plain, doped over v ith villages, and covered with artificially irrigated meadow lands and date groves. At Muhammareh (Persian territory) 40^miles above its mouth and 20 miles below Basrah the Shatt- al- Arab is joined by the Karun from Persia, and here properlv begins the delta, of which only one arm is navigable. For six months in the year this delta is converted into a swampy dis trict, through the melting of the snows about the head-streams m spring and occasionally by the action of the autumn rains. ^ noutl1 to Baghdad the main stream (Shatt-al-’Arab t and iigns) is navigable throughout the year for steamers of ^ some size (see page 100). mThe Shatt-al-Arab. The Shatt-al-’Arab is the river formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates above Basrah, and flowing into the Per sian Gulf at its north-western extremity. From the mouth to a point about eight miles above Muham- mareh it forms the Turco-Persian boundary. It is a fine river, 1|- miles wide at the mouth, and navigable as far as Basrah, by any vessels that can cross the bar at the entrance. At present the draught of vessels crossing the bar is limited to 18 feet 6 inches, which is far below the average draught of a modern vessel and as every additional foot of draught means approximately another 500 tons of cargo, the importance of giving increased depth of water over the Bar will be readily seen. A 24 feet channel from the outer bar to Fao can be obtained by dredging and depositing elsewhere some 4 million tons of sand and silt and 2 modern dredgers can do this work in 6 months. The land is very low on both sides of the entrance, but differs much in appearance, that on the western side being fertile and thickly covered with date trees, that on the Persian side being on the other hand comparatively bare and barren for several miles up the river. There are two channels leading into the river entrance, the- eastern or Khor-al-Amaya, and the western Khor-al-Kafka. The latter is the principal channel, and is the one used by steam vessels; it .runs between two .large banks and across broad flats, which form the bar already alluded to. To cross the bar vessels drawing more than 13 feet must wait, for the flood. At high spring tide (highest tides are night tide in winter, day tide- in summer), vessels of 20 to 22 feet draught can enter; at neaps the draught is 18. As the mud is very soft, powerful steam vessels are forced through a foot or more of it, and vessels- load to the actual depth available at the bar. A later examination, however, of the bar, concluded in 1911, under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief, East. Indies Squadron, indicates that at a moderate outlay of money the bar could be dredged so as to admit of the passage of vessels drawing up to 25 or 26 feet.18 Fao. The bar is about 2 miles from Ras-al-Bisha, the western most point of the entrance, and 3^ miles above Ras-al-Bisha is Fao, a village of about 400 inhabitants, and the late terminal station of the Turkish land telegraph line, connecting with the British cable (Indo-European) to Bushire and India. Fao has a rough stone landing jetty, with deep water a few yards from the outer end. There is a mud fort at Fao and in the neighbourhood, about 6,400 yards south-east of the telegraph station, is also an un completed brick work. This is closed work in the shape of a blunted redan (but nearly rectangular) facing approximately south-east. It is now in ruins and overgrown with reeds. (See also page 133.) Having entered the river, the banks are vely low on both sides the entire distance to Basrah, and are intersected by numerous irrigation canals; the country is often under water except for small raised banks between the plantations. The belt of land near the river is exceedingly fertile and produces dates, vegetables and grain. This belt extends from half-a-mile to 2 miles from the river bank; behind is waste country or swamp. Large herds of cattle roam along the banks of the river. On the ebb the wate^ is fresh and fit for drinking except in the autumn; then the river is low and slightly brackish. Ten miles above Fao it is always fresh at low water. Considered as a possible site for a railway terminus, Fao, which lies inside the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-’Arab, has all the disadvantages and none of the commercial advantages of Basrah. The land on the eastern bank as far as Muhammareh is known as ’Abbadan island, being separated from the mainland by the Bahmanshir river, which runs from the Karun river at Muhammareb. into the Gulf east of the Shatt-al-’Arab. Fao to Kabda Point .—Kabda Point is the long rounded point on the west bank opposite to and about 24 miles above Shallali Point on the chart. Previous to reaching this, Ma’amir village is passed on the western bank, 7 miles above Fao, and further up Ad Dorahj on the eastern bank a boat-creek runs off opposite Fao 1leading to the Bahmanshir, and above this is the large date grove of Qasabah. Shoal water extends from the eastern bank around Kabda Point. Kabda Point to Hafar Channel (Karun river). —In this reach there is shoal water around Dawasir island, and some diffi cult navigation by Mahalla island. The latter is formed by a shallow boat channel leading from Baraim village to Harta village on the eastern bank. Near the village of ’Abbadan, opposite the upper Dawasir island on the eastern bank, the Bahmanshir bends in to within a distance of miles. The refining works of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are situated on ’Abbadan Island. On the western bank above A1 Khast point is the village of Saiha, with a custom house; from here on to the Hafar channel the country is open and devoid of plantations. From 400 to 1,600 yards south of the entrance of the Hafar channel, which leads to Muhammareh and the Karun river on the Persian side, the ship channel of the Shatt-al-’Arab is obstructed by a bar, which occasionally, between February and June, affords a very low depth of water. Hafar Channel to Basrah. —From abreast of this channel the navigation space of the river is obstructed by the low grassy Dabba island, 4|- miles long and occupying three-fourths of the river width. Opposite the southern end of this island is the village of Mutawa, and thence for 18 miles up to Basrah there is deep^ water, and from here date groves line both banks of the river. On the left bank is part of the Muhammareh district; and part of the Basrah Qadha. The margin of the river is covered by a practically continuous line of date-groves, having a depth inland of from to 2 miles. East of the date-groves is a flat low lying alluvial plain, usually called desert,' but it is fairly well watered, and consists to a great extent of grass or cultivable land. Infantry could march from Muhammareh to a point opposite Basrah, by keeping 2 or 3 miles inland from the bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab. The Shatt-al-’Arab would then have to be crossed to reach Basrah. Two streams and several muddy creeks would have to be crossed. The right or western bank of the river'. —The margin of the river is covered by a practically continuous line of date-groves,having a depth inland of from ^ to 2 miles. There are some deep muddy creeks, some of which extend inland for a consider able distance from the river Shatt-al-’Arab. There is a ten- foot tide in the lower Shatt-al-’Arab, w r hich fills these creeks and probably any inland marshes, but exact information regarding these marshes is not available. West of the date-groves, the country is partly open desert and partly marshy as far as the Khor Zubair, an arm of the sea which runs up from Warbah island, northwards, and nearly parallel to the Shatt-al-’Arab, at a distance of 25 to 30 miles from it. The country between the river Shatt-al-’Arab and the Khor Zubair is believed to be not very suitable for the movement of troops, except along •one good track, which runs along the edge of the desert, im mediately behind the fringe of date-groves. (See Communica tions.) Much of this peninsula (on which Fao stands) is the piivate property of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammareh, though it was Turkish territory. West of the Khor Zubair again there is open desert, the going over which is reported to be firm and good. ^ The northern part of the Khor is surrounded partly by a marshy plain much intersected by creeks, and partly by an alluvial plain which is liable to inundation. -Approximate height above sea-level of Principal Localities on the Shatt-aVArab and Tigris rivers between Fao and Baghdad.

Northern ’Arabistan consists of the alluvial plains of the rivers Karun, Diz, and Kharkheh. The country is far the most part flat, though a few low ranges of hills exist. Southern ’Arabistan with the exception of the range of hills through which the Karun forces a passage at Ahwaz, consists of level open plains, mostly barren and thinly sprinkled with desert scrub. Some parts are grassy and cultivated. Near the coast the country is liable to inundation. Bahmanshir River .—From the eastern channel of the Shatt- alr’Arab, the Khor-al-Amaya, the Bahmanshir river is reached. This river forms, with the Shatt-al-’Arab, the island of ’Abbadan, extending to Muhammareh, where the Bahmanshir joins the Karun river. The Khor-al-Amaya channel is tortuous and shallow until near the Bahmanshir mouth, but vessels drawing 7 feet can enter the river at low water, the least depth to be passed over being a soft mud bar with 8 feet of water, 10 miles from the mouth. Inside the bar the depths vary from 10 to 15 feet, and at 5 cables from the mouth there is as much as 10 feet. The Bahmanshir river was the original mouth of the Karun, and, following the course of the stream, is about 50 miles in length from the entrance, 10 miles above the bar, to Muhammareh, or 35 miles in a straight line. It is navigable for vessels drawing not more than 7 feet for about 30 miles from the mouth. Its width near the mouth is 600 to 800 yards, but in the northern half of the river in some places it is only 300 yards across. The banks near the mouth are sloping and of soft mud, covered with coarse grass above high-water mark; a few miles further up the banks are harder and steeper. At about 22 miles from the mouth, villages and date gardens commence, and line the banks almost all the way up to the junction with the Karun. The northern part of the river for about 15 miles is very shallow, some of the mud banks drying almost across the channel at low water; the R.I.M. steamer “Comet,” drawing 3 feet, grounded twice in 1899 in steaming up. Karun river.—The entrance to the Karun river from the Shatt-al- Arab is by the Hafar Channel, 45 miles up stream. This channel, for all • practical purposes, forms the connecting23 link between the Karun and the Gulf, for the Bahmanshir, the* original mouth (vide page 17), is not generally favourable’ for navigation. The length of the Hafar Channel is 2 miles-, width 400 yards, and depth 18 to 24 feet. From Muhammareh to Ahwaz, a distance of 117 miles, the- Karun is navigable for vessels of 24 feet draught from August to November, and for vessels of 44 to 5 feet draught when the- river is high. To Ahwaz the width averages 400 yards, the channel being tortuous. The strength of the current, varies from 2 to 5 knots according to season. Just below Ahwaz there are rapids for - H miles; here cargo is generally transported from steamers to others above the rapids, but Messrs. Lynch’s Stern wheeler “ Shushan ” can effect the passage of these rapids. The Karun is the sole navigable river of South Persia, and forms the approach to valuable provinces; there is some import ance, therefore, to be attached to this river as a trade route. Muhammareh .—This town is situated in Persian territory, on the north (right) bank of the Hafar Channel, about one mile from the Shatt-al-’Arab and 46 miles from the Persian Gulf by that river. Muhammareh consists of about 800 houses, some of brick and some of mud, and is built on alluvial soil, chiefly along the river bank, where erosion is prevented by revetments of date logs. The town is enclosed above and below by date plantations about 4 mile deep, and behind the town is an open, treeless desert within any ground within sight. Beth banks of the Karun river are lined with a thick belt of date palms. The Shaikh of Muhammareh’s palace is about 4 miles up the Shatt-al-’Arab just above Failiyeh, and stands on the water’s edge. It is protected in rear by a deep canal. Muhammareh is 4 days by steamer from Karachi. The population of Muhammareh amounts to 23,000, and that of the neighbouring district of Fallahiyeh to 45',000. ’Arabistan is potentially one of the richest provinces of Persia, but the country lacks the population necessary to develop its great agri cultural resources. Thousands of acres could be put under cultivation in the neighbourhood of Muhammareh alone. Eveni^with the lack of development of natural resources, the trade of dMuhammareh is by no means inconsiderable, and has much increased recently owing to the disturbances on the Bushire- rShiraz road. The imports rose from 261,859?., in 1909, to 916,810?. in 1910, the bulk of the goods received being material for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which works in the Karun valley. The exports (opium, tobacco and dates) have also increased, but the wheat crop has gone down owing to the failure of the crops in two successive years, this having also happened :in the neighbouring valleys of Mesopotamia. Ahwaz is a village of 3,000 inhabitants, standing upon the left bank of the Karun at a point where the bank is high. Behind 'the village is a desert, and at the north end on an elevated salient .of the river is a ruined fort in a strong position. In 1913 a wall round the town was being built. Shushtar stands on elevated ground, between two branches of the Karun river. The citadel is situated on a sandstone cliff overhanging the Shatait, w r here that river bends due south. It is commanded at short range by part of the town and at longer ranges from the hills on the west bank of the Shatait. Some parts of the town are in ruins, and most of the houses are old. There are only 3 entrances to the town and in each case a bridge or ferry has to be crossed. Dizful is situated on the left bank of the Ab-i-Diz, where the bank falls away towards the river in conglomerate cliffs 100 feet high. The town extends 1| miles along the river and is | of a mile deep. The houses are closely packed, many two-storied of brick: the streets are narrow' and crooked. The outskirts of the town are mostly in ruins. The Governor-General’s palace is situated on the right bank, and consists of a rectangular enclo sure 500' by 300', incapable of defence. Below' IJizful is an ancient bridge of 24 arches. Neither Dizful nor Shushtar has any defences against assault. Basrah and vicinity. Description of town .—The towm of Basrah occupies an im portant position as the trade-gate of Mesopotamia and a portion of Western Persia, and as the port of transhipment from ocean going steamers, to the river boats and caravans of the interior. It is situated 67 miles from the sea on the right bank of the Shatt- ^al-’Arab. As a port itThas disadvantages under present condi-25 'S™i° r . alt , h ?' gh navigation up the Shatt-al-’Arab for ocean steamers is fairly easy, there are some shifting shoals and a mud-bar at the mouth limiting the draught of vessels which can ffl1l w lly , ente Q , T i e , tl ? e , 1S 1 f 1 e ! t U P to Qurnah, the rise and fall bemg from 9 to 10 feet, but this is dependent on the strength of the wind and the amount of water in the river. After cross mg the bar ocean steamers anchor off Basrah in mid-stream whence the cargo is discharged into wooden lighters, carrying lo to 20 tons. There is not room for two vessels abreast,'but any number can lie up and down the river, which is here 600 .yards across. Ma gil or Kut-al-Farangi, as. it is known by the Arabs, some 3 miles up the river from Basrah, has, owing to its extensive deep water frontage, been selected as the most suitable locality for Port development and solid wharves for deep water -steamers, floating pontoon landing stages for river craft, sheds, warehouses and roads are in course of construction. There is a bridge over the river at Gurmat Ali. The actual town itself- lies 2 miles from the river on a narrow- creek, the Nahr-al- Ashar, along wdiich a very fair carriage road runs. It stands in a large area, once enclosed by a mud wall with raised towers at intervals, all of which are now demolished or out of repair The remains of the wall enclose an irregular rect angle, 4,300 by 2,200 yards, the buildings being at the south west corner, and the rest of the space filled with date gardens. The population, including suburbs, numbers 33,000, mostlv composed of sedentary Arabs. There are some Europeans and Indians, about 3,000 Persians and 1,000 Jews. Surrounding country and communications .—The country sur rounding Basrah is quite flat everywhere. All available informa- ticaif regarding land communication will be found in Chapter The river routes are fully described in Chapters VI and VIII (see pages 95, 112 and 137). The Shaiba Bund. Twelve miles north west of Basrah on a high sandy rido-e stands the old group of Forts known as “ Shaiba.” Between Shaiba ridge and Basrah lies a stretch of desert without a single tree or bush, growing only a few scattered .patches of grass too poor to afford grazing to sheep or cattle.Years ago this desert was a well cultivated area irrigated by canals and yielding plentiful crops of grain. Bad administration allowed the canals to fall into disrepair and the ruin was completed by heavy floods from the Euphrates. When in flood this great river for many miles of its course has no banks and unless some systematic effort is made to bring it under control it will for ever be liable to change its channels with little warning, to ruin, in a single season’s flood, land under cultivation, to fill up a lake with deposit or to create a marsh. The damage may be done by the work of a single season but the process of reclamation is of necessity slow and uncer tain. The flat desert between Basrah and Shaiba has three distinct boundaries: to the north, the Euphrates near its junction with the Shatt-al-’Arab, east, the Shatt-al-’Arab itself, west, the Shaiba ridge. In March 1915 the battle of Shaiba was fought and after a hard struggle we inflicted a severe defeat on the Turks. Our main position was the Shaiba ridge while the base of supplies was Basrah. After we had taken up our position the Euphrates floods swamped the whole desert between these two places. The difficulties of keeping open communication and maintaining supplies were enormous. Pack mules and small country boats alone could cross the desert with supplies of all kinds; at times the boats had to be forced through semi-liquid mud and the mules sank to their girths. Once the Shaiba ridge has been reached the area liable to flooding can be avoided without difficulty and communication can be maintained with the interior towards Nasiriyah. and other places in the Euphrates valley. The importance of preventing a recurrence of last year’s flooding between Basrah and the Shaiba ridge is clear as an aid to possible military operations. The value of any protection afforded now will be enhanced in years to come after the war when the development of the country by irrigation is taken in hand. Until the floods of the Euphrates, which now sweep over the country from March to July can be checked, communication with the high ground will be impeded and no attempt to reclaim the desert for cultivation can be thought of.27 ied by repair ate. course brino umels under :sh, eason ncer- itinct with , the 'ter a Our iplies rates aces, ining boats limes the liable :ation other year's an aid banced of the per the ication reclaim W ith thna two-fold object in view the Engineers of the Meso potamian Field Force were ordered to build a bank, with one flank on the Shatt-al-’Arab and the other on the Shaiba ridge. This bank of earth is about forty feet wide at the bottom and seven feet high. The first mile of it lies through a belt of palm trees on the right bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab; from there on wards it stretches across the desert for ten miles till it meets the ridge which is well above any possible flood level. The first two miles run due west and the remaining eight roughly south- west The main channel of the Euphrates is about three miles north of the bank. The prevailing winds are from the North and North-West across the immense lake formed by holding the flood water back! so tnat tne bank is subject to continual lapping. •nn 6 waters , be g in to drop early in June and after the middle of the month all danger of the bank being breached is over. 0 Zubair.—-This town, the site of old Basrah, stands in the desert 9 miles to the south-west of the modern Basrah, and forms tfie first stage on the route from Basrah to Kuwait or Najd. Around the town, which is walled, the country is entirely barren except to the south-east, on which side a scattered series of lucerne and melon fields, hedged with tamarisks, extends to a distance of 3 miles; this tract is called Dirhamiyah, and the drinking water of the town is supplied by its wells. There is in the town a large covered bazaar, mostly of masonry, and the dwelling-houses are either of sun-dried or of burnt brick, the latter being excavated in great quantities on the adjoining site of ancient Basrah. n/r P 0 P u ^ a ^ 0n about 6,000, and virtually all are Sunni Muhammadans, as is natural in a place which holds the tomb of Zubair arch-rebel against ’Ali, and killed here in fighting against him. Many notables and land-owners of the Basrah neighbour- hood have country houses at Zubair, to which they retire in the ot weather m quest of a drier atmosphere, and some important amiiies of Central Arabian origin are also located here. Juss or gypsum mortar is exported from Zubair, and sandals and rude saddlery are manufactured, but the carrying trade pro bably supports a larger number of the population than any other- industry. The melons of Dirhamiyah have a high reputation.28 Zubair is a market town for the surrounding Bedouin tribes. The ruins of old Basrah extend from the walls of Zubair for 3* miles along the road to the modern Basrah; they consist of mounds of earth intermingled with fragments of yellow burnt brick, and they cover an area of several square miles. Two miles from Zubair, on the southern edge of the high road, are the remains of one of the principal mosques of the ancient town; part of its northern minaret, faced with excellent yellow brick, is still erect. About a mile to the east of this old mosque is the tomb of Talhah, who was slain along with Zubair in the Battle of the Camel, fought near this place in 656 A. D. These two monuments alone remain to testify to the greatness of the former city. The Tigris Valley (from Baghdad to Basrah). The river Tigris forms the principal means of approach from Basrah and the Persian Gulf to Baghdad, and, as noted by Sir W. Wilcocks, is the only means of communication worth the name between the capital of Mesopotamia and the outer world. Approaching one another to within a distance of 24 miles at Baghdad, the Tigris and the Euphrates then trend apart r finally uniting at Gurmat ’Ali and thence flowing as one stream to Basrah. The country between the rivers is the ancient Babylonian plain, once of great fertility, but now largely lying waste owing to the want of irrigation canals and the proper artificial control of the water which existed in former days. The lower part between the two rivers, prior to their junc tion, is mostly marsh, with brakes of canes and reeds, while along the lower course of the Kharkeh, a Persian stream which joins near Qurnah, there are also extensive marshes, so that south of ’Amarah traffic is restricted to the river, and any military movement from Basrah to Baghdad would necessarily have to be by steamer or boat, unless a wide detour were made to the west by the Euphrates valley as will be described later.. Between the river and the hills on the Persian frontier on the east, the country is flat and termed “desert” shortly after the vicinity of the river is left. As a matter of fact, how ever, although there is no cultivation, this tract is fairly well watered and is to a great extent grass or cultivate land.29 The Euphrates Valley (from Fallujah to Basrah-}. The valley of the Euphrates offers somewhat different characteristics to that of the Tigris. In the first place the course of the river is by no means clearly defined, and in addi tion to the old and new channels of the main stream, there are many subsidiary watercourses and tracts of water which, especially in the time of flood, complicate the question of move ment and navigation in this region. On this account the river is in present circumstances little used as a means of traffic. On the other hand, it is possible by the Euphrates valley to reach Basrah by road. There is a through route, avoiding the main water difficulties, by Diwaniyah and Samawah to Suq-ash-Shuyukh, and thence to Basrah, the marshy tract which prevents this place being reached by the Tigris valley being skirted by moving along the edge of the desert. Samawah can also be reached in a more roundabout manner, via Karbala and Najaf. The general nature of the Babylonian plain, which occupies the_ space between the two rivers, has already been alluded to in the last chapter. West of the Euphrates the tableland of the Syrian and Arabian deserts approaches to within 30 miles of Najaf and thence continues south within a short distance of the river. This desert tableland is of different formation accord ing to locality, and where it merges into the Mesopotamian lowlands it is by no means an altogether arid waste. Large numbers of nomad tribes circulate over well-defined tracks, and the soil of fine sandy gravel offers a good surface for movement. General nature of the country on the river banks. —From the Hindiyah barrage to the end of the Shinafiyah Lalje there is continuous cultivation on both banks, and the traveller is never_ out of sight of many date groves. Where the banks aie high, wheat and barley are grown, and lower down there is an enormous area of rice cultivation, which is far more pro fitable than winter crops which are ruined by floods every second or third year. In the direction of Diwaniyah also there were large areas under cultivation, but owing to the drying up of the Hillah branch of the river, many have ceased to exist. The completion (1914) of the new Hindiyah Barrage (q.v. below) will, no doubt, remedy this. It is said that the lands on the Euphrates round about Hillah used to pay a B30 revenue of about ^T.57,000 a year, whereas they now pay practically nothing. It seems that the cultivating population has migrated from the now dry Euphrates to the Hindiyah. Between Shinafiyah and Samawah • there is not much cultiva tion. As the banks are high, canals are impossible, and cul tivation by lift would be laborious. Further, it is said that during the last fifteen years, this tract has been much disturbed by Arab raiders. From Samawah to Nasiriyah cultivation is scattered, but taken as a whole fairly extensive; irrigation is done by water lift, except close to Nasiriyah, where rice cultivation begins. From Nasiriyah to beyond Suq-ash-Shuyukh is a long suc cession of gardens and cultivation, and the country appears incomparably richer than^ anything seen elsewhere in Meso potamia. In several places Sir William Willcocks has com pared it with the very best parts of Egypt. From Suq-ash-Shuyukh to Qurnah there are extensive date plantations, and their area can be almost indefinitely increased if the swamps are reclaimed, which w r ill not be difficult to do if Sir William’s schemes are carried out. As regards through-traffic, many caravans come from Central Arabia to Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Nasiriyah and Najaf, and there ought to be a large trade in skins and wool, in addition to the local trade in dates, rice and cereals. If the people could conveniently export their produce, there would no doubt be a corresponding increase in the import trade. Hindiyah Barrage .—The Hindiyah Barrage is the only work, of those projected by Sir W. Willcocks, which has actually been taken in hand and completed by the Turkish Govern ment. It is situated a short distance below Musaiyib, at the pPint where the Euphrates divides into two branches, one flowing past Hillah, the other, the Hindiyah Branch, towards Najaf. Owing to various causes the former commenced to silt up about 45 years ago and though an attempt was made 20 years after to remedy this by the construction of a barrage in the form of a weir across the Hindiyah Branch, the situa tion became more and more serious, as the fertile areas below Hillah and in the direction of Diwaniyah were gradually drying up. By 1910, Hillah itself was in a‘parlous state, water only reaching it during floods. In that year the repair of the old barrage and construction of a new barrage was begun by Sir31 W. Willcocks, who later handed the work over to Sir J. Jackson and Company, by whom, in spite of many troubles, political and physical, it was completed in 1914. The new barrage is provided with gates so that the height of water held up can be controlled, and the Hillah Branch has a regulating head. Two locks to take large country boats were constructed in conjunction with the barrages. The dimensions proposed were 55x8 yards. This work should restore the lands, of which mention has been made, to their old position of prosperity, and increase the area under cultivation. It will ensure a perennial flow of water along the Husainiyah Canal to Karbala. Towns on or near the Tigris. {See also route reports, pages 121, 122 et seq\). Qurnah .—A town of 5,000 inhabitants on the right bank of the Tigris, and situated at the junction of that river with the former channel of the Euphrates. The date plantations, commencing at Basrah, continue for 4 miles to the north of Qurnah where there then begin the great marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates, extending between those two rivers, and the marshes to the east formed by the overflow of the Karkheh, and other streams. The two lines of telegraph, leading from Baghdad by the Euphrates and Tigris respectively, unite at Qurnah. There is a telegraph office open at Qurnah connected by a line to Basrah. A railway has been made between Qurnah and ’Amarah and is open for traffic. Shatrat-al-'Amarah. —(Qal’at Salih) 500 houses. Amarah .—Amarah is a small town on the Tigris River about 100 miles north of Basrah as measured on the map, but con siderably more by water, owing to the winding of the river. It occupies the apex of a triangle between the Tigris River and the Jahala Canal and consequently possesses a large river front along which substantial brick buildings have been built, in great contrast to the small collections of'mud huts, which form the habitations of the majority of the Arabs living away from the river, b 2The Christian sect of Sabians have their principal location at Amarah. The two towns, R-ut-al-Amarah and ’Amarah are the principal places between Baghdad and Basrah. After Amarah had fallen into our hands, steps were imme diately taken to acquire these houses for hospitals and billets for troops and to improve the sanitation and communication. A road is being made to Shaikh Saad. Road making is most difficult, owing to the absence of stone in the country, and the construc tion of a road, to take heavy motor traffic in all weathers, presents a problem difficult to solve. At Amarah it was found that a certain quality of silt clay when deposited in layers and well rammed produced a surface capable of throwing off dhe rain-water and thus maintaining a hard crust on the road way. This is in great contrast to the ordinary mud roadways of the country which soon become seas of mud under the in fluence of rain, and in which heavy carts sink to their axles. If, however, the hard crust gets worn into ruts during wet weather, rain water is held up and the road surface is soon ■destroyed. Much land has also been reclaimed from the river at and near Amarah by means of earthen revetments or bunds, and huts for the accommodation of troops and hospitals have been and are being built. All materials for these huts have to be obtained from Basrah, through the Engineer Field Park. This latter organisation is responsible for the supply of all enmneer- ing material, nearly all of which has to be obtained from India, since at the present time the only resources of the country tor building purposes are mats, reeds, and a poor quality of buck. Date palms are the only trees growing in the country m any quantity, and are too valuable to be cut down as timber in any case such trees would be of very little value for con- ■structional purposes. Bridges at Amarah. 1. There are three Boat Bridges at Amarah (c) Over Tigris River. (b) Over Jahalah Creek, (c) Over Musharrah Creek. 2. The Tigris Bridge as left by the Turks on their retire ment from Amarah, is a little over 500 feet long and consistsof 20 “ Saffinas, ” a native boat 30 feet long, 11 feet beam, o feet free board, made of branches of trees for ribs, and planks made watertight with a coating of pitch on the outside. The gunwales act as saddles for the road bearers, which alternate in spans of 10 feet and 15 feet. The small “ cut ” or swing portion to allow boats to pass through consists of a raft of 3 Saffinas; and the large cut, to allow steamers.to pass, includes the small cut and a second raft of 9 Saffinas operating in two portions. Each portion swings on to the left bank. ‘ The bridge is closed by pulling on a wire cable that connects the large raft to the fixed portion, ■and then pulling the small raft to the big one. The old Turkish Saffinas are gradually being replaced by new ones of similar dimensions but built on more scientific lines. 3. The Jahalah Bridge consists of 27 Dannaks (a native canoe covered with pitch and decked over) fitted with saddles; the spans between canoes varying from 10 feet to 15 feet. Two on the left form the “ swing out ” to allow mahelas to pass. 4. The Musharrah Bridge consists of 6 Dannaks and one Saffina, thus forming a hogback which allows small craft to pass underneath. . 5. The Bridges can take Field Artillery and are provided with hand railings. Kut-al-Amarah. —4,000 inhabitants and the centre of a considerable grain traffic, most of which comes from the Shatt- al-Hai (more usually known as Shatt-al-Gharaf) the canal or channel which runs across from the Tigris at Kut to the Euphrates. 500 houses, with telegraph office and barracks for 200 men all on the left bank of the river, with a bridge of boats across. Caravan routes lead to Baghdad and Mandali; from Badrah on the latter route, a difficult hill track crosses over to Kirmanshah in Persia. 8hatrat-al-MuntafLk is a small town on the Shatt-al-Hai, and is on the boundary of the Basrah and Baghdad wilayets. In the neighbourhood lives Shaikh Bargash of the Muntafik tribe. The Shatt-al-Hai is dry in the low water season, water then being obtained from springs in the river bed. Some further details regarding these towns will be found in route (river) 'Report No. 4. (See page 136)./ 34 Towns on or near the Euphrates. (See also Route reports, pages 121, 122 et seq.). Gurmat 'Ali. —A large village built on high ground in the marshes, connected with the Tigris by a large water-channel and with^ Basrah by a carriage road through marshes and date groves. The country on either side of this road is not passable for troops. To the north-west are reed-covered swamps with many island villages standing like towers out of the* water. To the west is the hhor or open water. A bridge over the Euphrates was opened here in December 1916. Suq-ash-Shuyukh. —An important town situated for the most part on the right bank of the Euphrates; it derives its name from the fact that the desert tribes resort to it for trade. The town has numerous fruit gardens, and its date planta tions extend up the left bank of the Euphrates till they meet those of Nasiriyah; the neighbourhood, unfortunately, is marshy and the climate unhealthy. The Euphrates is spanned at the town by a bridge of about 12 pontoons, the number of which is increased to 15 or 16 when the river rises. P°P u ^ a tion of Suq-ash-Shuyukh amounts to about 12,000 souls, about three-fourths of whom are Shi’ahs; but it includes &lt;00 fsabians and 300 Jews. The religious head of the Sabians lives here; the community, who have a small primary schoo! for their children, are mostly goldsmiths, blacksmiths and builders of Mashhuf canoes; they inhabit a quarter on the left bank of the river which is connected with the main town bv the bridge of boats. J . There are over 200 shops at Suq-ash-Shuyukh, but, except with the Arab tribes, there is no considerable trade. Nasiriyah. —Nasiriyah is a comparatively modern town of some 10,000 inhabitants, founded on the left bank of the Euphrates, about 19 miles from Suq-ash-Shuyukh, by Nasir Pasha, chief of the Muntafik Arabs, to perpetuate his residence. It usually had a garrison of one or more Nizam battalions, and was the place of assembly for the various expeditions designed from time to time to overawe the Muntafik. A railway connects the town with Basrah. J Samawah —Samawah stands principally on the right bank o tlie Euphrates, and is built of materials obtained from some ancient ruins close by. There is a boat-bridge. ■■35 It has a good bazaar, and is a special centre for the corn trade of the adjoining districts of the Euphrates. To the south the river bank is lined with extensive date gardens. There is a ferry a short way down stream at A1 Khidhar. Rumaithah .—Rumaithah is a town of about 2j500 inhabi tants, who are all Shi’ahs. There is a bazaar of some 180 shops, but many are now deserted. The houses, in number about 600, mostly low mud huts, are scattered among gardens and plantations. It was formerly a place of considerable prosperity, but owing to the drying up of the branch of the Euphrates on which it stands it is now half deserted. After the date harvest a good deal of business is still transacted here with the Arabs of the neighbourhood. The opening of the new Hindiyah Barrage (see pages 30—31) may favourably affect this place-. Diwaniyah is situated on the Hillah branch of the Euphrates, which, before the completion of the new Hindiyah Barrage (see pages 30—31) in 1913, had dried up. The population (in 1908) numbered less than 4,000, mostly Shi’ahs, and was decreasing. The houses are mostly of sundried brick. The town depends for supplies on outlying places, and water is obtained from wells. The trade is practically nil. It is the headquarters of the Diwaniyah Sanjaq, and its central position in the district is its only recommendation as such. The nominal garrison was 1 battalion and 3 guns, but seldom more than 80 men were present. The town is connected with Hillah by a double, and Samawah by a single line of telegraph. Formerly there 'was a bridge of boats across the river. Hillah .—Hillah is the chief town of a qadha of the same name in the sanjaq of Diwaniyah. The population, three- fourths of whom are Shi ah Arabs, number 30,000. Surrounded by gardens and fruit trees, Hillah is the centre of a district which produces wheat and barley in abundance, though in 1908 its agricultural prosperity was on the decline owing to the drying up of the branch of the Euphrates on which it stands. This may have been stayed by the opening of the new Hindiyah Barrage, at the junction of the two branches of the river near Musaiyib. There were (in 1908) some 2,000 shops and 120 grain stores, and considerable trade was carried on. It is calculated that under favourable conditions the following36 supplies could be collected in a week; 400 tons of wheat; 600 tons of barley; 100 tons of rice; 1,000 oxen and cows; 600 buffaloes; 300 horses; 100 donkeys, 50 mules; 700 camels, and 5,000 sheep. There is a post office and telegraph office. The military garrison consisted of 1 regiment of cavalry, 1 battalion of infantry, and 3 guns. There was said to be a large stock of ammunition, equipment for a battalion of reservists, and a reserve battery of field guns. M usaiyib .—Musaiyib is an important place on the Baghdad- Karbala road; it contains 1,000 houses, and the permanent in habitants number some 3,500, with a floating pilgrim popula tion of 1,500 more, mostly Shi’ah Arabs and Persians. The larger part of the town, including a covered bazaar, is- on^the left bank. There is a bridge of boats (24 in number), 185 yards long, crossing the Euphrates (see also page 217). Transport is not readily obtainable; there are 100 shops and 25 grain stores; there are 40,000 date trees, and the place is- the centre of a good agricultural district. Najaf (MetMad 'Ali ).—Najaf is a place of 12,000 inhabi tants, including a number of Indian Moslems; it contains the shrine of Ali, and is a spot of great sanctity among Shi’ah Moslems, some 6,000 corpses being brought here every year for internment. It is about 30 miles from Hillah, and is situated on an ele vated ridge of sandstone 150 feet above the plain. It is sur rounded by walls 25 feet high and 5 to 6 feet thick, of burnt brick, with no ditch; these are nearly square in circuit, and strengthened at' intervals by bastions, the houses inside being closely^ packed. 8 Water is scarce; wells brackish; best drinking water in skins from Hindiyah canal, 4 miles off. Tim town is dependent on the Bani Hassan and Muntafik Arabs for supplies. There was formerly a regular garrison of one battalion. Supplies abundant from Baghdad to Najaf. Over 2 000 nil grims a day pass over this route in pilgrim season, lasting about 4 months and never have any difficulty about supplies The country which is most fertile, with much corn, and immense flocks of sheep, would support an army corps, on march or halted, for some time, if the inhabitants were friendly NajafItself is situated in middle of desert, and supplies are all brought in on donkeys by Arabs. b Karbala (Mashhad Husain). —Karbala is on the plain 20 miles west of the Euphrates, with which it is connected by the liusamiyah canal. J The town contains 5,000 large well-built houses, has now no walls but is surrounded by date groves and gardens, amon- which many houses are hidden. 0 Water-supply, often uncertain, is from the canal. (The com pletion of the new Hmdiyah Barrage in 1914 should have assured a perennial flow of w^ater in the canal). Brackish well water is otherwise used. The population is about 60,000, mostly Arabs and Persians with many Indian Moslems and a few Jews; the few Turks are tiios© connected with, the Government. The Mosque of Husain, which is also his burial place, is a peculiar object of veneration for the Shi’ah Moslems, and there- 01 e a Persian religious centre of great importance. , ,T he t°T is frequented by Shi’ah devotees from all parts of the Moslem world. 1 The bazaar is well stocked, and busy, and Karbala is the centre of a busy agricultural district, with abundant supplies. Karbala was recently made the head-quarters of a redif division, and the place is the seat of a mutasarrif under Baghdad. Consul W&amp;S Unt ^ thG outbreak of tbe P res ent war a British 0 Vice- ■ Baghdad. Description. The city of Baghdad, at one time a famous capital of the Moslem world and in what was once one of the richest and most productive regions, is situated on both banks of the Tigris nearly midway between Musal and the Persian iTulf. It is still the largest city of eastern Turkey in Asia, the population being reckoned at about 140,000, of whom some 00 ,000 are Jews. On the east bank lies the most modern portion of the town, including^ the Government offices and the chief commercial and public buildings. On the west bank is the old town, en closed by an extensive tract of orange and date groves. The old walls of brick have been demolished, except in a few places,notably in the south-west corner, but the ditch still remains now dry for the most part, and enclosing a circumference of about 6 miles. The remains of the old covered way and glacis form a line of mounds, giving a command of 10 to 15 feet over the plain. There are two gates still remaining, the south-east gate (Bab-ash-Sharqi) on the right bank, the north-west gate (Bab- al-Mu’adhdham) on the left bank. The citadel near the north west gate still exists but its walls are also falling into decay. The town has no architectural character whatever, and even in the modern portion the streets are mere alleys crowded with bazaars, which are arched in with brick. The late XVali, Nazim Pasha, among other measures took in hand the question of street improvement, but his acts were not characterized by prudence, and he caused great resentment by the various de molitions which were carried out by his order. The shops are well supplied with European articles, including Manchester cotton goods and English stores. The Sarai (residence of the Wall), a good building, is situated on the river bank north of the citadel; near, and also on the left bank, above the bridge, are the infantry barracks, an imposing two-storied brick building, on three sides of a square, able to contain 3,000 men. The artillery and cavalry barracks and stables are in the citadel and outside the north-west gate. In addition to the regular barracks, a standing camp of mud built huts has recently been established outside the town about 1 mile from the south-east gate. There was a large European colony, chiefly British, who lived in good houses on the left bank of the river near the British Residency. A fine hospital, built by a wealthy Jewish merchant, has lately (1911) been opened outside the north gate, while there are French Carmelite schools, a Jewish high school and a branch of the Church Missionary Society. The representative of the British Government in Baghdad had for long occupied a privileged position in comparison 0 with the status of the representatives of other foreign powers. These latter fulfilled the ordinary functions of consuls, but the British representative was styled Resident (he is referred to by Arabs as “ Safir ”—ambassador) and had a guard of 30 ' IndianInfantry, with a gunboat of the Royal Indian Marine (R.I.M.S. “ Comet ”), stationed on the river. Communication across the river is at present maintained by a bridge of boats consisting of 22 pontoons, made of wooden planking, coated with bitumen. The breadth of the roadway is 30 feet. On the pontoons near each end of the bridge facing south are cafes, and in the centre two rooms for the watch men of the bridge. This bridge was constructed in September 1902, and is in good repair, but the steep ascent and descent at each end make it difficult for horses, and almost impassable at low water for wheeled vehicles heavily laden. The bridge is 221 yards long, and 16 of the pontoons are about 42 feet long, but three pairs in the centre and near the ends are 52 feet long. The breadth of the pontoons is about 18 feet. In high floods or strong wind the bridge has to be swung back. The approaches on either bank are through narrow, winding streets. The current in April is about 4 miles an hour, the average width of the stream being 250 yards, and in flood it is 30 to 36 feet deep. To allow boats to pass, six pontoons next the right bank, can be swung back. In conjunction with other improvements due to the initia tive of the late Nazim Pasha, tenders have been invited for the construction of an iron bridge, 240 yards long and 40 feet broad, with a swinging portion of 33 yards for the passage of steamers. In addition to the steam boats plying on the river, which will be alluded to in Chapter VI, 100 large sailing-boats are available at Baghdad, carrying from 20 to 100 tons each, and 200 wicker coracles carrying^ 1 ton or ten men. A British firm in 1911 supplied three 12 knot motor-vessels to work as ferry boats on the Tigris at Baghdad. Country immediately around Baghdad .—The country general ly around Baghdad is quite flat with desert both east and west. This desert, however, in many places is covered with pasturage in spring or after any fall of rain and there are some immense tracts which only require irrigation to become fruitful. Imme diately in the neighbourhood of the river there is cultivation and on the right bank gardens and cultivated tracts extend for some way.40 South of Baghdad towards Mahmudiyah, movement off the raised embankment, on which the road runs, would be difficult- after rain or if the river were high. West towards Fallujah, the desert is in parts sandy clay and in parts pebbly, covered at first with camel-thorn and then with scanty shrubs. East, the country is an open sandy desert, uncultivated but cultivable; in the valley of the Diyalah towards Ba’qubah movement would be difficult for troops on account of the numerous water-cuts. No positions for attack or defence of the city offer except on the south side, where on the right bank of the river, at 3 miles from the south gate, a line of low earth hills form a fairly good position facing south and extending for 2 miles, with the- left bank resting within ^ mile of the river. The suburbs, the gardens and date groves could be connected by earthworks with the hills and a regular line of defence formed on the right bank, but the left bank has no natural advantages for either attack or defence. Approach from the south by the Mahmudiyah road could be met by a defence of the bridge over the Khirr steam, 3 miles south of Baghdad. The locality here offers a suitable site for the construction of a bridgehead covered by the occupation of the wood in rear. North-western shores of Persian Gulf (Fao to Kuwait). Proceeding south-west from the entrance to the Shatt-al- ’Arab, there are two main inlets or indentations in the coast line (i) the approach to Umm Qasr, and (ii) the Bay of Kuwait. (i) Approach to Umm Qasr. This place lies at the head of a rectangular opening of the- coast line, the space so formed being occupied by Bubiyan island, with the Khor ’Abdullah and Khor Sabiyah inlets leading round this island to Umm Qasr. Just in front of Umm Qasr is the smaller island of Warbah. The Khor Abdullah is 13 miles wide at its entrance by Ras-al-Qaid, 17|- miles long up to Warbah island and 8 miles- further on to Umm Qasr.The channel to follow to reach Umm Qasr Mess north olr Warbah island, between this and the mainland. Great care is necessary to avoid a sandbank extending eastward from Warbah island, but there appears to be nowhere less than 24 feet of water available for navigation, and it is considered that the shallow part off Warbah island could be dredged if neces sary. Anchorage may be taken up anywhere in the channel, but there is a well-sheltered and deep anchorage between Warbah and the mainland as Umm Qasr is approached. Both shores of the Khor ’Abdullah are of a very low alluvial land, covered in places with reeds and grass and with shallow flats extending a long way out on both sides, more particularly from the northern shore. Bubiyan island is 25 miles long by 12 broad, but it has no permanent population, and apparently no natural water-supply. It belongs to the Shaikh cfl Kuwait, but in 1902 a small Turkish post was established on the narrow Ras-al-Qaid peninsula. A small brick barrack was constructed, but all supplies, in cluding water, had to be brought by dhow from Fao. The post has since been removed. The Khor Sabiyah, which separates Bubiyan from the western mainland, is about 1,000 yards wide, but is shallow,, and not suitable as a means of approaches to Umm Qasr.- Warbah island is about 8 miles long by 2 broad; it is flat and sandy, and about 10 feet above high water-level. At the south-west end of the island there 'are great natural advantage&amp; for the establishment of a port. It will be recollected that the channel to Umm Qasr runs along the eastern point of Wardah island, and that Umm Qasr cannot be reached by the Khor Sabiyah and Khor Salaa along the western end, but if one pro ceeds up the Khor ’Abdullah and then turns off along the south, of Warbah island, the bank or bar in the northern 'hannel. which has to be crossed to reach Umm Qasr, is avoided and a deep channel is reached extending to the south-west corner of Warbah. This is rather narrow, but has good anchorage for the largest ships and is quite landlocked. If the channel were dredged, a very fine harbour indeed might be made. Umm Qasr is the name of a small creek at the head of the Khor ’Abdullah and on the banks of which the Turks con structed a small fort. North of Warbah island, the Khor ’Abdullah and Khor Sabiyah unite, forming the Khor Zubair,42 from which the Umm Qasr creek branches off to the west about 4 miles above the junction. The Khor Zubair is about | mile wide and contains deep water opposite Umm Qasr and for 14 miles inland. At this point, it divides, into two branches, one running north-eastwards, with a depth of 18 feet, to within C 12 miles of the Shatt-al-’Arab, the other much shallower and narrower, going further west to within 10 miles of Basrah and Zubair. Although, however, the depths of the channel in the Khor Zubair are generally good, the navigation is not alto gether easy. For anchorage and landing see page 105. The Umm Qasr creek itself is about 3 miles long and ^ mile broad, with a depth of water generally of only 3 to 4 feet. The fort is situated about ^ mile inland, but the usual landing place is at the entrance of the creek. The building is nearly square, measuring about 120 feet each way, and having one entrance in the north face; a recently constructed salient on the west side enfilades two faces. The walls are 15 feet high, loopholed at 4+ feet from the ground, and are built chiefly of mud; the gateway and coping of the walls are of burnt brick. There are wells with a plentiful supply of water to the northwai-d opposite the entrance to the fort at 250 yards distance, and the water used by the garrison is sweet: whether it is obtained from these wells, or elsewhere, is uncertain. No supplies are obtainable at Umm Qasr, and not even vegetables are grown; there is grazing for sheep, but not for horses. The ground in the neighbour hood is firm and gravelly. Umm Qasr is said to be more healthy than Basrah; it is 15 miles from Safwan and 34 from Basrah: there are wells on the direct route from Zubair to Umm Qasr, but travellers between Basrah and Umm Qasr ordinarily pass through Zubair and Safwan. For details of routes via Zubair and Safwan see Chapter VIII, Routes Nos. 1 and 2, page 112 et sea. The country to the north and east of the Khor Zubair is marshy for several miles. Safwan, on slightly rising ground, has wells of passable water 12 feet deep. There are a few houses and a date grove sur rounded by a wall. Jabal Satiam, an isolated volcanic hill, stands 5 miles to the west. f&lt; of 3 of fo ti a of a m pi bo th bu P t: e g n o: ni G p&lt; ♦ ar il sii43 Umm Qasr and Safwan constituted the southern limit of Turkish occupation as distinguished from the territory under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The political relations between the Shaikh and the Ottoman Government are mentioned in Chapter I. (it) Kuwait Bay and Territory. Following the coast line of the Khor Sabiyah round to Kuwait Bay or harbour, there is only one spot which calls for further notice, i.e., Sabiyah (the Khor Sabiyah has been alluded to on page 41). Sabiyah is a fortified mud enclosure belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait; it is situated on the east bank of the Khor about 3 miles from the tip of the promontory that divides the mouth of the Khor Sabiyah from Kuwait Bay. The enceinte of the fort is about 100 yards long by 80 yards broad, and at high tide the sea approaches it very closely; in spite, however, of a rather steeply shelving bank, landing is difficult on account of mud, in all states of the tide. The garrison consists of about a dozen retainers of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The supply of water, from wells outside the enceinte, is brackish; there is a plantation of about 300 young date trees. Sabiyah formerly boasted some cultivation, which it owed to Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim, the enemy (now deceased) of the present Shaikh of Kuwait; but the place was ruined in hostilities between Shaikh Mubarak and some of his nephews about 1899. Sabiyah is surrounded by some tamarisks, which, in approaching the place from the west, first become visible at a distance of about 5 miles. Extent of Kuwait territory .—The boundaries of the Kuwait principality are for the most part fluctuating and undefined; they are, at any given time, the limits of the tribes which then, either voluntarily or under compidsion, owe allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The northern and southern frontiers in the neighbourhood of the sea, may, however, be regarded as fixed; on those sides the question is not between the Shaikh and nomadic Arab tribes, but between the Shaikh and the Turkish Government. On the north the most advanced Turkish out posts upon the main land were at Umm Qasr and Safwan, and the influence of the Shaikh of Kuwait was unquestioned up to the very walls of those places; we may accordingly con sider the frontier on this side to be a line running from the44 Khor Sabiyali so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to the Batin. On the south the Turks had no station nearer to Kuwait town than Musallamiyah Island; the Shaikh’s boundary on the south may be considered to run westwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to Nta’ and onwards to Warbah. It is a task of great difficulty to circumscribe the Shaikh’s territories on the remaining sides with even approximate accuracy. Shaikh Mubarak stated (1904) that on the north-west his influence reaches to the Batin and somewhat beyond it, and that on the west the inhabitants of Summan, but not those of Dahana, acknowledge him; and his assertion is to some extent borne out by known facts in regard to the occupation of Hafar, which Ibn Rashid, though at one time he seized it, was unable for long to retain. We may therefore consider that the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and the south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from'Dahana as far south as the point where that line is inter sected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh.' These being the limits of the Kuwait Principality its length from N.-N.-W. to S.-S.-E. is about 190 miles, and its breadth from E.-N.-E. to W.-S.-W. about 160 miles. The maritime possessions of Kuwait consist of the islands of Bubijan, Warbah and of Failakha, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and ’Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Kuwait Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al-Maradim. Kuwait Harbour.—A remarkably fine bay some 20 miles long and 10 miles wide, stretching approximately east and west, forms an excellent and flourishing harbour. The sur rounding country to the southward is low-lying, level, and of the ordinary desert type, stretching away as far as the eve ean see. The “ Hill Fort ” shown on the charts, some 7£ miles south-east of the town of Kuwait, stands 180 feet above sea level, and is a conspicuous object when entering the bay from the sea. It is a well-built square erection, with towers at the corners. There is a small village to the south-east of this fort on the coast, nestling among palms and other trees. For anchorage and landing see page 105. With the exception of some sand-hills immediately to the south of the town, which are referred to in grater detail further45 on, the general character of the country along the southern •shore of the bay is the same, i.e., an unbroken level plain of fairly firm whitish sand stretching away to the south and south west. After reaching its most westerly point in Dohat Kadhamah, near the head of which lies the village of Jahrah, the coast-line makes an abrupt turn to the north-east. Along this northern side of the bay, about 2 miles from the water’s edge,-there runs a line of heights, steep and cliff-like on their sea face, having an elevation of about 200 feet. These give valuable shelter from the prevailing and most important wind, the shamal, which Mows from the north-west. Owing to this shelter no sea at all distressing to big ships is raised in the bay, even by a strong north-west gale. The general direction of the coast-line then trends eastwards until it reaches the Khor Sabiyah, which separates the swampy island of Bubiyan from the mainland. Along this shore a mud flat extends some distance from the beach, and increases in width to the eastward until it is nearly 5 miles in breadth opposite to Ras-al-Ardh. Failakah Island, at the entrance to the bay, is about 7 miles long by 3 miles wide at its western end. It is all very low- lying, its highest point being only 30 feet above sea level. There is only one village, Zor, on the north-west coast. The Inhabitants of the island number some 500 souls. The island is unhealthy, and the water indifferent. Kuwait Town .—The town of Kuwait lies on a small projec tion, or tongue of land (which terminates in Ras-al-’Ajuzah), on the southern shore of the great bay to which it gives its name. The town extends about a mile along the beach; it is provided with numerous substantial stone breakwaters, which form tidal harbours for native craft. The beach dries out to a considerable distance, and landing when the tide is out is by no means a pleasant operation; ponies are taken out and are mounted from the boat, or failing this it would be necessary to wade for a considerable distance. At high water, how-ever, the sea washes up to the front row of hcArses and landing from boats, or any of the sea-walls, is an easy matter. It is a re markably clean, well-built and prosperous looking town, with many solid stone houses, others being built of sun-dried brick. The bazaar is broad and open, clean and busy. The town is surrounded by a low wall with towers, which, however, are not in a good condition for defence.‘'‘nrrrr'TT—fim— 46 Outside the main gate, on the southern, or land, face, ther&lt;' is a large suburb of mud huts, which is the point of arrival and departure for the caravans trading between Kuwait and the interior. Here may be seen strings of camels, Avaiting for their loads or having just got rid of them. Here, too, the Bedouins mostly congregate, as, if armed, they are not allowed to enter the town itself, camp and transact their business. The popula tion is estimated at approximately 35,000 souls, of whom some 50 are said to be Jews from Bushire, with a synagogue of their own. The town is said to contain about 3,000 houses, 500 shops, three caravansarais, six coffee houses, three schools and four mosques, as well as numerous warehouses and stores. There are no statistics or definite date available, but the growth and prosperity of the place may, perhaps, be inferred from the fact about 30 new houses are said to be built, and 40 new shops opened, every year. It is connected to Basrah by a land telegraph line via Zubair. Population .—The following detailed estimate of the popula tion of Kuwait territory was furnished by Shaikh Mubarak in 1901 :— Fighting men in Kuwait Old men and children Women ..... 19.000 13.000 22.000 54,000 Fighting men in the district (within 10 miles of Kuwait ... Old men and children Women ..... 12,000 9,000 14,000 35,000 Total 89,000 There are no means of checking these figures, least of all those referring to the districts outside Kuwait itself, which must include many wandering tribes of Bedouins, and as such must be subject to considerable fluctuations. It is possible that at the time this estimate was furnished, the numbers of persons in the town had been increased by an influx of out lying tribes taking refuge in Kuwait, at the approach of IbnRashid; in this case, perhaps, the exaggeration may not be quite as great as it would appear at first sight. If the apparent over-estimate of “ fighting men ” be reduced to the numbers mentioned in another estimate, also furnished by the bhaikti, ru'.. to between 6,000 and 7,000 men, with a roughly propor tionate deduction from the numbers of women and children, the total number of inhabitants would seem to work out to between 30.000 and 40,000, the former of which is the number usually considered to be approximately correct. The population is Muhammadan, Arab fashion, that is, tolerant to others and not over-rigid to themselves. The Wahabi faith is proscribed, and all the efforts of^ Naid have never succeeded in making one single proselyte at Kuwait. Resources .—Nothing grows near Kuwait, save grass and vegetation for camel-grazing; the agricultural resources may, therefore, be -considered nil except at Jahrah, (q. v. page 42). During the winter months there is some sparse grazing, enough for the needs of- the Bedouins’ herds of frugal goats, even on the apparently arid plain round the town of Kuwait; Dut the best grazing grounds, much frequented by Bedouins, are those around Jahrah, Kadhamah Bay, and thence along the north ern shore, between the Zor hills and the water’s edge. No sign of cultivation can be seen on the higher ground north and north-west of these heights. The wealth of the place proceeds from its trade, shipping, shipbuilding, fishing, pearl fishing, and, to a small extent, cattle-breeding. Some 500 boats, with crews averaging from 15 to 40 men each, are engaged in pearl fishing. The size of these boa s varies from 30 to 300 tons burden, while some, of as much as 1.000 tons are engaged in trade with India and Mesopotamia. The sea-going cargo boats number between 30 and 40. There are about 300 carpenters, who gain a livelihood by boat building; all the material is imported from India. Fishing is evidently a considerable industry; the fish weirs on the flat beach between Kuwait and the open sea are a very conspicuous object. Besides the fish most commonly met wi in Eastern waters, excellent soles are to be had, which would be, no doubt, a feature in the “ menu ” of the hotels, should this harbour ever become the ocean terminus for any railway such as that now contemplated.48 Administration .—The Government is patriarchal, even as the Shaikh himself is the living presentiment of one’s idea of the biblical patriarchs. A big dinner is prepared every day for any wanderers and strangers who may wash to share it; the one and only restriction is that arms must be left at the gate. The Shaikh exercises political and the Qadhi judicial func tions. Punishment is rarely inflicted, and there seems to be but little governmental interference with the liberty of the subject in any respect, and to be little need for^it. No tribute, is, or ever has been, paid either to the Amir of Najd or to the Turkish Government. Nor is tribute exacted fiom other tribes. The Shaikh has a Customs Department, but no statistics are available. Thus under a succession of common-sense rulers with a policy wisely originated and systematically pursued, an Arab band of pirates now appear as the masters of a thriving free- trade port. In December 1914, the Shaikh of Kuwait adopted a special flag of his owm. Currency .—The currency is cosmopolitan. As elsewhere in Arabia the Maria Theresa dollar, “ real ” (the value of which: is about 1 rupee 8 annas) may be considered the standard medium of exchange; while Persian krans and Turkish copper- coins are also met with. English sovereigns are occasional^ to be found, and the Indian rupee is not despised. Bills can be obtained on Basrah, Bushire and Bombay, and also, it is- said, on the capital of Najd. Mater-supply .—Mater is obtained from the followino- sources :— ° (0 Scattered wells south-west of the town, and 4,000 to 5,000 yards E.-N.-E. of Bandar Shuwaikh. Most of the water for the town is got from these wells. (n) Wells with abundance of water about 3 miles S.-S.-E. of Kuwait. (Hi) W ells at Ras-al-’Ajuzah, east of the town. (if) Wells at Jahrah. The water is reported to be of indifferent quality. Water is also obtained from the Shatt-al-’Arab, and a tank steamer has recently been acquired by the Shaikh for this pur pose. rClimate .—The climate is distinctly good as compared with that of many ports in the Persian Gulf- In December and January it is perfect, and can only be compared with that of Egypt—fine and bracing in the mornings and evenings, and never unpleasantly hot. Even during the hot months of the year, the prevailing wind, from the north-west, which blows from the desert, is somewhat tempered by crossing_ 10 miles of the waters of the bay, while, on the other hand, it has not absorbed enough moisture to have that muggy,, steamy and relaxing character with which it reaches Bushire. Though the drinking water is brackish, fever is practically unknown,, and dysentery and opthalmia are rare. In short, as has been rather quaintly remarked, ‘ 1 where men commence begetting new families at 80 and die at 120, the climate cannot be considered as prematurely exhausting. Trade—The resources of Kuwait are entirely commercial. Its geographical position as the only seaport for the Jabal Shammar district of Central Arabia, as well as its mercantile aspect, has in this respect been compared with Trieste s some what similar position with regard to Austria. Palgrave remarks on this similarity, and considered it to conduce to a continuance of the good relations existing in his day (1862—63) between the Shaikhs of Kuwait and those of Hail. This, however, has not been the case since _ Shaikh Mubarak’s accession. The loss of trade due to the disturbed state of things which has obtained of late years must have been considerable, and the anxiety of Ibn Rashid (Shaik oi Amir of Hail) to possess himself of Kuwait, or at the least to set up a Shaikh there friendly and subordinate to himselt is. easily understood. The natural advantages of this seaport as a mart are evident and lasting. Imports are chiefly cereals, piece-goods, tobacco, dates, coffee, sugar: exports tobacco, wheat, pearls, dates and gu. Jahrah. —A village which lies some 15 miles west of Kuwait, at western extremity of the bay, about 1,200 yards inland from high water mark. It is well built of sun-dried ric s and has a circumference of about a mile and a l ia “- er ^ are out-lying patches of cultivation round the walls, and many enclosures containing wheat, date trees, lucerne, _ tamaris', etc., surrounded by mud walls, from 2 to 3 feet thick anc [ or 10 feet high; most of these contain their own wells, tnewater of which is; as a rule, good for irrigation purposes only. The population may be estimated at about 500 souls. There is an old fort (in disrepair) on the western frontage of the village, as well as a new one, built by the present Shaikh, clear of the south-eastern end of the village. Climate. The climate of Mesopotamia may be classed as tropical, with an excessively hot summer, during which the plains be come scorched and bare. The winters are short and mild, forming the pleasantest part of the year. Corn is sown about November and December and harvested in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised as well. The climates of Kuwait, Fao, Basrah, and Muhammareh are very similar. Kuwait appears to be the coolest, owing to the proximity of the sea and the sandy deserts. Basrah occasionally has frost at night in Januaiw. The average heat in summer is 108 degrees in the shade : extreme, 118 degrees. It is cold in winter but there is seldom any frost. The coldest time is in January. The rainy season is from December to February. The prevailing wind is from the north-west, called “shamal,” which blows for a month at a time in the hot weather and is somewhat of a relief. The following table gives an average range of temperatures taken at Fao, Basrah and Baghdad :—wmmmmmm 52 Rains -—Rains may fall between the middle of November and the middle of March. Total appears to vary from lii' -to 3^ at bao; at Basrah it is about 6'. There are occasional showers at all seasons. The wettest months are December, January and February. Winds. —During the first half of March and during July north-west winds prevail with dry heat. From about the middle of July to the end of September the atmosphere is damp as well as hot; there is little wind from September to January. South winds may be expected in December to April, north and north-west from April to September. In September and October there are frequently fogs at night and in the early morning; especially near Fao. Health .—Malarial fever in the season of floods and in the a u tu mn is the principal disease of the country, though this fuIT be decked by the building of 'bunds to stop the flooding of the country. Epidemics of cholera and plague occur. The spread of the former and of choleric diarrhoea aie much increased by the enormous number of flies. The prevention of the plague of flies and its elimination ^rorn camps, etc., in Mesopotamia depends on the following Whenever possible, trench latrines should be abolished in favour of the tin and incinerator system. So lon» as the present trench latrine system is in use in an y part of a camp, flies are bound to swarm. Where trench latrines must be used, fly-breeding must be prevented by the liberal use of light mineral oil or some other agent that will prevent the flies settling and the maggots developing. A bottle of this oil should be at every trench; each man using-the latrine should sprinkle oil and then earth; when the trench is filled in, earth and oil should be used. If this is done, the flies will not settle on the feces, they will not lay eggs_, and the feces will be surrounded T b y a layer in which the maggots cannot live. it should be noted that fuel-oil, pesterine and the like will not do for this purpose; the volatile constituent must be present. Even w&amp;ere tins are used, oil should be sprinkled to keep flies off the feces.Unless it is certain that the heaps will burn and are burnt completely, it would be better to spread out the wet horse dung till it is dry, then put it in the heaps to burn. Dry horse dung breeds no flies but wet horse dung preserved from desiccation in litter sweepings, etc., does. The proper disposal of kitchen refuse is important. Where incineration cannot be practised and it must be buried, it can be oiled. Above all it must be collected: chance bits of wet refuse, thrown on the ground, not noticed, breed both house flies- and blow flies. A danger source is the offal -of goats slaughtered by native units. It should be incinerated and, failing that, buried at once before flies can lay eggs on it. Where possible, as in standing camps, there should be a supply of oil at the butchery, and when the pit is being filled in, oil should be poured over at about 12 inches from the ground level, to form a protec tive covering through which maggots or flies could not come to the surface. As every one suffers alike from the plague of flies it is- important to get all ranks to understand that dirt and carelessness breed the flies. The man who defaecates in a ditch, the man who chucks food refuse down anywhere, the sais who does not burn his horse dung, these help to produce the plague; flies always mean a faulty latrine system or a dirty camp and this needs to be brought home. There is a belief that flies breed all over the place, in the desert, in soil, etc. So far as house flies and blow flies go, that is not so; man produces his plague of flies himself entirely. Flies are in some number at Basrah; as you go up river you have these brought from Basrah till you get within three miles of Amara, when you get more. As you get to successive camps up river you get more and more, till it culminates with the plague at the most ad vanced positions. There is no natural production of flies and the plague is due to faulty latrines,.. faulty disposal of refuse and dirt.■BSSmm 54 ** The methods discussed above are suitable to trench and camp, but are impossible in a moving echelon. A body of men moving will not be troubled with the flies they breed unless they halt for more than nine days; if they adopt the usual trench system, the plague of flies will commence at each halting place about ten days after they , reach it. Apart from flies, there is danger of typhus from lice and the annoyance of the sand fly. Both can be coped with if the proper remedy, Vermijelli or some equiva lent is issued to everyone. This is a specific for ^ lice, extensively used in the army in France, Flanders and Egypt. It is rubbed on the person or the seams of clothing and is used to wash clothing. A very small amount rubbed on the hands and face keeps sand flies and mosquitoes off for the whole night. Basrah is said to be less unhealthy than it used to be; at present, however, it is malarious most of the year. The con struction of bunds as noted above, should diminish the pre valence of that disease. The winter is the most suitable time for military operations any time between October and March. For climate of Kuwait See page 49. 'Arabistan .—Rain may fall at any time between October and the middle of May; it is commonest in December. From the beginning of October to the end of March the climate is good. During January the thermometer falls as low as 40° at Muhammareh, and in Northern ’Arabistan it some times reaches freezing point (32°). The heat during June, July, and August makes military operations during these months almost impossible. -During the hot weather, especially in autumn, malaria is prevalent at Muhammareh, but no doubt much of the sickness is due to the insanitary condition of the town. This is the case also at Shushtar. In July the thermometer sometimes reaches 110°, and at Shushtar occasionally even 120.° The nights in the neighbourhood of the Karun are generally cool. In 1857 the troops suffered much at Muhammareh from myriads of flies by day, and from sand flies by night; but the heat was found to be less than at Bushire.\11 routes in Southern ’Arabistan are almost impassable after rain, and in dry weather they are very trying owing to the sand and dust. Both Dizful and Shushtar are too hot to allow of life under canvas being either healthy or pleasant during the hot weather. Yet the finding of a suitable hill station is difficult. The nearer hills appear to have no water at the necessary elevation, while the distance to any place of the required elevation is almost prohibitive. A site in the Mangasht hills at an elevation of 7,500' has recently been reported on by Captain Noel. From Dizful, Khurramabad, 4,050', is about 100 to 150 miles according to the route taken. Two places called Pahreh, 4,250 and Challan, 4,280', where tribes camp, are only 40 and 53 miles respectively, Bazmu, 5,000 , is 100 miles, and would be suitable from a climatic point of view. From Shustar, Qal’eh Bazuft, 5,300', is HO miles Along the Bakhtiari road, Malamir, at 80 miles, is only 2,9.)0 , and Dih Biz at 113 miles is 5,200', and yet it is deserted by its inhabitants in summer. The Physical and Climatic Difficulties of the Meso potamian Theatre of War. Iraq is a vast plain of alluvial clay unrelieved by a single range hill, or natural eminence of the slightest importance; it is low-lying throughout, and even Baghdad—560 miles ~y river from Fao, and 340 as the crow flies—is only 11- feet \long the Western border of Iraq the sterile Arabian desert comes close up to the Euphrates, which has no right-bank effluents and therefore at no time provides water for eitffir wells or streams that might be an aid to military operations in the desert country. „ , +l 0 On' the Eastern border the plain stretches away to the Persian Mountains, which follow roughly a line running paralle to, and 15 to 40 miles from,, the left bank of the Tigris. Between these boundaries so defined lies a count ry to describe in detail, even in general terms because it is rarely the same for more than a few weeks together. _ It is an - of marsh and desert, of river and lake, where a ^se of the water- level amounting to only a_ foot or so will alter of the land and convert into a huge expanse op ' ’■HBBmnan 56 or into an impassable morass, what was an arid desert only a few days before. A fall of the water will almost equally quickly lay bare scores of square miles of thick brown mud that only needs time to dry to become capable of supporting most military traffic. But when the water recedes it generally does so whole-sale leaving behind not even so much as a soli tary pool, for troops to draw upon; where it remains it is held in brackish marshes and is probably unfit for human consump tion. Nor does rain alleviate matters; in fact it makes them rather worse. The average annual fall is only 6’43 inches, of which not less than 5 inches are, as a rule, distributed over the period from the beginning of November to the end of March. The amount in those five months is little enough, but it is the nature of the fall rather than its sparseness that causes the trouble. In Mesopotamia slow, steady rain is almost unknown. 'I he storms are frequently of great violence and accompanied by hail and strong gales; occasionally they continue into April and they were particularly bad during April 1916. They come on with remarkable suddenness and may bring all troops move ments to a dead stop in a few minutes. They do not, as a rule, last long and the worst recorded at Basrah this year (March 22nd) only lasted about half an hour in that time, however, it did a good deal of damage, and hailstones, the size of walnuts, fell. From May to October, any rain is quite exceptional and what little there is may be expected to take the form of light spasmodic showers. The so-called “ flood season ” has little or nothing to do with the rains and owes its being almost entirely to the melt ing of the^ winter snows in the Caucasus and in the Highlands of Asia Minor hundreds of miles away. The rivers commence to rise early in January and reach their high level at the end of March. _ April and May are the principal months for floods, which begin to subside early in June and may be considered over by the end of July. The period of lowest water is dn the months of September and October. During the high-flood season practically the whole of the country watered by both the Tigris and Euphrates, from just below Baghdad to the sea, is beneath the flood-level of those nvers : in fact on the Tigris, except for a few isolated mounds and banks, there are only three places a few feet above flood- level, viz. :—Shaikh Saad, a point about a mile and a half below Kut-al-Amarah, and Ctesiphon, and the two first-named57 are insignificantly small areas, only a few hundreds of yards square. The rivers are kept within their banks only by means of marginal dams, or “ bunds, ” constructed almost throughout their length from the headwaters to the Persian Gulf. These “ bunds ” are composed of loose earth just heaped up at the edge of the river, and they are generally less than 6 feet broad and only three or four feet high. When one goes up the rivers during the floods and observes that the surface of the water on which the steamer floats is a foot or two above the level of the surrounding country, the importance of the bund and its apparent unsuitability for its work strike one with great force. In peace time the bunds are a source of constant anxiety to the Arabs, for a broken bund, probably not noticed until the river has pierced it, must be repaired at once if miles of land are not to be put under water. In 'war-time the bunds are of even more vital importance, for whole tracts of country may be rendered untenable by the judicious cutting of one of them, or a flank may be secured or a line of advance barred by the same simple device. In view of the length of the bunds and of their imperfect construction, it is not surprising that the confinement of the w^ater leaves much to be desired and that there are many large areas of marsh and shallow lake close to the rivers. These areas one would naturally expect to find actually contiguous to the river banks, but it is a remarkable fact, not yet fully explained, that the chief lakes and marshes are not contiguous to the rivers but anything from half a mile to four miles away from them, the land between being dry and not marshy except during prolonged bad weather. These narrow strips or belts ” of land between river and marsh are one of the most noteworthy features of the country, for it is to them that mili tary operations are usually of necessity confined, with the consequence that direct frontal attacks over absolutely flat ground, without a vestige of covers are so frequently unavoid able. This, in itself, is a great difficulty, but there are other factors which add to the complexity of the problem. Thus the dry belts are intersected by creeks and irrigation canals that hamper free movement and are generally sufficiently broad and deep to necessitate bridging. They are of all shapes and sizes and are so numerous that, seen from an aeroplane in the flood season, they resemble the costal bones of a fish■■■■ 58 ^ joining the spinal column. This applies with particular force to the river Hai, where no less than 36 water-courses, all more than 5 yards wide occur on the right bank between Nasiriyah and Kut; following the bunds of the river the distance is 136 miles between the two places, so that there is a creek to cross every four miles approximately. On the left bank the situa tion is even worse, for there, more than 40 creeks occur besides the Bad’ah river, which has a breadth of 60 yards. The length of the creeks is anything up to 20 miles. On the Tigris and Euphrates the creeks and watercourses are almost as numerous as on the Hai, and many of them, 'V like the Wadi, and the Musharrah are so wdde and deep as i to attain to the proportions of rivers. It is a curious fact that nearly all the watercourses connected with the rivers are distributaries and not tributaries; there is scarcely, with the notable exception of the Wadi, a genuine affluent in the whole country, for even the streams that flow from the Persian Mountains lose themselves in the Suwaikieh or in the Huwaize which, like the other great marshes, absorb the water drained from the capital rivers through the medium of creeks and irrigation cuts. The marsh and lake-areas lie beyond the dry belts; they may be anything up to 20 miles in width and up to 50 miles or more in length, but their dimensions are an uncertain ever- varying factor. During the flood-season the marshes themselves are quite -4 ► impassable, although dry strips of ground are found in the intervals between some of them. In the low-water season some of the marshes dry up alto gether, others shrink considerably and the dry ground between the latter will usually be fit for most kinds of traffic; in some places, however, the drying ground contracts to such an extent that wide cracks occur, rendering movement of cavalry and wheeled transport out of the question. Tracks actuallv travers ing the marshes exist in the dry season, but they are little used even by Arabs and it would be inadvisable to depend on them for military purposes, except for small bodies of infantry and cavalry in an emergency; the ground remains soft even in the driest years and any regular traffic would soon land both man and horse knee deep in mud. ^The actual positions of lakes are occasionally greatly affected by the direction and force of the wind. Certain lakes have been observed to extend on one side or contract on the other .for as much as one or two miles when a strong wind from the North has succeeded a strong wind from the South. These changes do not take place gradually either; in one case the edge of a lake approached a camp at a rate of between 12 and 15 yards a minute and necessitated a rapid change of site. Troops may encamp at night on good dry ground with little or no water in sight and yet find by daybreak that a broken bund, a shifting lake, or the effects of seepage have made it impossible to stir from the camp, which may itself be under water. Indeed so great is the risk of unpleasant surprises, and so deep the mud at times, that causeways some miles in length have sometimes to be built. Along them, troops, guns and transport move in the direction required, and when they reach their journey’s end the camps they occupy, or the trenches they man, must often be surrounded by dams or other earthworks if they wish to be reasonably sure of not being flooded out before the morning. All these difficulties are at their maximum during the period of high flood at which time the movement of troops near marsh or river is fraught with considerable risk. Also the flood- period comes at an unfortunate time of the year. If there were no floods in March, April and May, these months would be the best for military operations; the weather is then better than at any other time, there is little rain, and a reasonable temperature prevails, but these climatic advantages are entirely nullified by the floods whose subsidence is followed immediately by the burning heat of June, July and August. Beyond the marsh and lake areas lie stretches of desert which are, generally speaking, unflooded, and passable but waterless. In the East the desert extends from the edge of the marshes to the Pusht-i-Ivuh, but here it is liable in parts to be inundated by the overflow from the Abi Gunjian Chun and from the mountain-streams when the snows are melting during March and April. West of the Tigris the desert similarly begins at the edge of the marshes some 20 miles from the river and extends until it merges in the marsh area watered by the Hai and its Eastern—or left bank—distributaries. West of the Hai the process is repeated towards the Euphrates, so that speaking in broad terms, there is always the same sequence ofmmmmmmmammtma 60 features extending outwards on both sides from the main rivers, viz. :— River. Narrow dry belt traversed by creeks. Marsh and lake area. Desert. Marsh and lake area. Narrow dry belt traversed by creeks. River. This sequence continues from the Pusht-i-Kuh on the one side to the eastern edge of the Arabian desert on the other, only in the south does a different picture present itself. Here, from Suk-us-Sheyukh downwards, the Euphrates cannot be said to have a clearly-defined bed, and the whole area included in the triangle Nasiriyah, Gurmat Ali and a point midway between Qurnah and Ezra’s Tomb becomes one huge expanse of open water and marsh, with only a solitary half inundated village here and there and with the Hamar Lake as its principal feature. In the dry weather the marshes recede but the general marshy-character of the triangle remains unchanged. The northern and southern sides merge into desert, its eastern side is closed by the Tigris and by the dense belts of palm groves that follow that river’s course for nearly 120 miles, from Qurnah down to the sea. They are another landmark of the country, but a detailed description of them need not be given here; suffice it to say that fighting in them resembles fighting in woodland, aggravated by the presence, every few yards, of ditches deep with bog or water, and innumerable low banks and mud walls. The palm-belt area is always damp, and here it is that the humid heat takes quite as much out of man and beast as the scorching sun up-country. In Basrah the maximum shade temperature recorded last year was 115° Fahrenheit; this year the highest up to date has been 112‘2°. The mini mum temperature in Basrah for 1915 was 36°, and for 1916 it stands at present at 32°. Inland the average readings vary at different places up to Baghdad, but the contrasts between maximum and minimum are even greater than near the sea. It will thus be seen that the climate of Iraq is one of extremes. The hot weather begins in May and ends about the beginningof October, the hottest months being June to September, both inclusive. In November the weather is cool, and in Decem ber, January and February it is decidedly cold, especially up stream, where the temperature not unfrequently falls below freezing point. March and April are warm and unsettled, with occasional thunder and duststorms. There is no natural shade of any kind, for trees are scarce in Mesopotamia. Indeed here are practically none but date-palms, which give poor shade, and from Qurnah to Baghdad not even these exist outside the palm gardens at Amarah and Ivut; the wood at Kutniyeh (about half-way between Azizieh and Ctesiphon) and a few other isolated clumps form the only ex ceptions. Lack of trees means lack of wood both for building and burning; the fibrous palm is ill-suited for the former pur pose, and for the latter it provides only the “karab,” that is the thick end of the palm-branch cut off near the stem—at best this is only moderately good fuel. Thus nearly all wood (including firewood) has to be imported from India and else where. The question of arboriculture has been taken in hand and experiments have been made, but there is so much sub soil water near the surface that most exotic trees get water logged and die. To the lack of wood must be added an almost total absence of stone, which has therefore also to be imported. Below Baghdad stone is found only at Samawa and at the Jabal Sinam, an isolated volcanic hill some 80 miles south-west of Basrah. There are consequently no metalled roads in the country beyond those made by Indian Expeditionary Force “D,” and all the local houses are built of sun-dried brick. These houses are of little benefit to the Army, because they are rarely where they are most wanted and because the majority of them are most unsuitable as billets. They are wretched hovels, badly ventilated, without water, without proper cook ing-ranges and without sanitary arrangements of any kind; before the British came to Iraq the open street was the public latrine of the lower orders. The best houses consist of a quad rangular shell of rooms built generally in two storeys round a square courtyard, which slopes towards a small hole in 'the centre. The hole is the entrance to the cesspool and when the sub-soil water rises during the flood-season the courtyard is flooded, as may be the lower rooms as well. When the water subsides it disappears through the hole, and a foul stench62 comes up instead. There is nothing to keep the houses cool, no verandahs, only an expanse of country brick that retains the heat during the day and gives it out again when the sun is down. Houses of this nature cannot be used as Hospitals and are often unfit to use even as store-rooms. So new houses have to be built but before the walls are begun the ground must be laboriously raised by earth, brought to the spot in boats or in mule-panniers, otherwise the subsoil-water will rise up into the basement during floods, destroy the foundations and swamp everything. As regards supplies, those locally produced are of little value in supplementing those imported. This is not so much because local supplies are scarce as because, owing to trans port difficulties both by land and water, and to the attitude of some of the Arab tribes, the local supplies cannot be got in from the surrounding country in adequate amounts. Some local products, such as fresh vegetables and potatoes, are cer tainly scarce, but others, e.g., rice, salt, barley, bhoosa, and ghee would suffice to meet all demands could they but be collected. Potatoes and vegetables present an additional problem in that the heat is liable to make them uneatable in a short time. Where cold storage is impossible, onions will spi'out and other vegetables rot, if they cannot reach the troops quickly and be consumed at once. Fresh meat could also be obtained in ample quantities where it is possible to induce the Arabs to bring in their cattle or to allow 7 sheep to come down from the Persian Hills. Grazing for horses exists in places, and during part of February and March 1916 the horses w'ith the Tigris Corps were able to dispense with the Government fodder, but grass cannot be depended on for long, and it rarely grows where it is most w r anted. The impracticability of drawing to the full on local products seriously affects the question of river-transport and a great .deal of tonnage is absorbed in carrying to the fighting troops .■supplies of all kinds that in any other theatre of war would /certainly be obtainable on the spot. Eiver transport is further ihandicapped by physical and climatic conditions affecting the Hye-rs themselves. In the low water season (August to - Feb- v&gt;uary, both inclusive) the draught of vessels is limited to a maximum of 20 feet at the Outer Fao Bar, and this only under favourable conditions on the top of the tide; trans shipments are therefore often necessary. Between Basrah and63 «s cool, retains the sun fospitals i houses ground spot in fill rise idations f little ‘ much trans- ttitude be got Some re cer- la, and mt be itional ble in ; will troops Iso be se the down laces, , with iment rarely oducts \ great troops would further ng the )' Feb- ; to , a only trans- h and Qurnah, the draught of vessels proceeding up-stream is limited to 10 feet in the low-water season. Between Ezra’s Tomb and Qal’at Salih is a reach known as “ the Narrows.” The width of this reach is only about 65 yards; the depth is not more than 5 feet during the low-water season, and it is neither safe nor practicable for one vessel to pass another unless the up-bound one is banked in. Thus the scope of the Tigris, as a line of communication, is limited to the number of vessels which can move at one time up or down stream through the Narrows. It is further limited by the fact that the Narrows are not navigable after dark, in fog, or in sand haze. In certain parts of the river, owing to its narrowness and to the strength of the current, to the presence of sandbanks, and to frequent high winds, it is extremely difficult to bank in when bound down-stream; a case in point is Qal’at Salih where vessels can only stop at great risk. From the end of March to about the middle or end of July the current in certain reaches of the Tigris attains a rate of 5 knots and constitutes a further serious obstacle to navigation; it is an uncertain factor too, as it varies with the season of the year and in different parts of the river. Thus in the Narrows it might be anticipated that the current would be unusually? strong in the flood-season; but it is not so, for the banks of the^ river in this locality are very low and the water overflows into- the surrounding country, so that vessels frequently run ashore- through being unable to divine the river proper. From Kut to Amarah the current is very strong in the flood-season being pent in by comparatively high banks. During the last low- water season (1915) vessels of the “P” class reached Kut drawing over 5 feet, but only after overcoming almost insuper able difficulties. A vessel like the “ Medjidieh,” specially designed and built for Tigris navigation, carries a full cargo of 400 tons on a 4 feet draught, but “P” class vessels cannot get down to this draught when light even after dismantling- top-hamper. On the Euphrates the conditions are less trying, there is little or no current and few difficulties present themselves till the entrance to the Hamar Lake is reached. This is very narrow and even in the high water season it is inadvisable for vessels to attempt to pass. On the edge of the Lake there is a bad bar carrying only about 2 feet of water in the low- water season and complicated by a tricky bend on the bar c 264 itself. The channel across the Lake is devious but there are no difficulties for shallow-draught vessels in the flood-season; in the low-water season all traffic is stopped except for heliums. Off Beni Hoteit, and 8 miles east of Hokeika, there are two more bars, but these and all other obstructions in the Lake should be removed in three or four months from now by the powerful dredger already at work, which will dredge a channel 150 feet wide and 6 feet deep below the water. Above Hokeika the Euphrates presents a broad, deep easily navigable channel for any river-craft and no difficulties remain but those due to sand haze and wind which, in the form of the “ Shamal,” blows particularly strongly on the Hamar Lake. The prevailing winds in Iraq are from the north and north west, and the Shamal comes from the latter direction. It normally begins about the middle of June and blows more or less continuously for about 40 days, although there are occasional lulls of from 24 to 48 hours’ duration; its velocity 'occasionally reaches 40 miles per hour and it has the effect of drying the atmosphere and of affording some relief from the intolerable summer heat. Other winds in Iraq are the “• Sharqi,” or east wind, which brings high temperatures with it, and the south wind which is invariably oppressive and accompanied by dust. All the winds may produce shifting lakes and all affect shipping to_ some extent, whilst the dust they raise increases the^ difficulties of observation for airmen and adversely affects their engines by choking them up. The pulling for artillery teams is very heavy in places, and even where the surface is good at first it soon cuts up and be comes heavy, if a succession of vehicles attempt to make a track. The same applies with even greater force to mechani cal transport where such can be utilised at all, and anything heavier than a 30-cwt. lorry will probably break through the desert crust and get bogged in the mud beneath. Where the 1 ground is soft, solid tyres will cut in from the outset, so pneu matic tyres are almost an essential. The consumption of petrol is extraordinarily high (3 to 4 miles per gallon for Peer less lorries) owing to the impossibility of using the higher gears even in dry weather, and in wet weather it has been found that mechanical transport is quite unable to move anywhere. It will thus be seen that in Iraq, all military problems,65 ■e are eason; Homs, 'e two Lake by ie bannel okeika lannel 3 due ml,” whether strategical, tactical or administrative, are affected by climate and physical conditions to an extent rarely met with m any theatre of war. Nearly all the conditions combine to cieate difficulties, few to alleviate them, and most may be ascribed either to a lack of water or to a surfeit of it. Far away from the rivers want of water makes operations impossible, whilst near them the excess of water is almost as great a source of trouble. ortli- .

The bulk of the inhabitants consists of Arabs, either nomad Bedouins or, in the case of the populations of the towns and villages, sedentary Arabs; of the nomad tribes, the principal are the Muntafik, under Ajaimi bin Sa’adun Pasha, who used to live at Suq-ash-Shuyukh, and the Bani Lam, on the left bank of the Tigris towards the Persian hills. There are many sub divisions of these tribes and also numerous other smaller tribes. The nomad Bedouins, especially the Muntafik, were in constant conflict with Turkish rule and supplied no soldiers to the Turkish army, in consequence of which the local units of Baghdad and Basrah were invariably below the proper strength. The Turks proper form the official classes and the ruling element of the towns. Apart from the Arabs and Turks, there are certain numbers of Chaldeans and Sabians, with some ‘ Persians and a good proportion of Jews, mainly in Baghdad itself. The Chaldeans (a Christian race who claim to be de scended from the old Assyrian stock) are not encountered as a rule so far south as Baghdad, except when engpged on work on thp river. They provided the crews of the river steamers. The headquarters of the Chaldean Church is at Musal, and there is also a considerable number of this sect at Baghdad. The French, under whose protection they are, use the Chaldean Catholics as a medium of French political influence. The Sabians, another Christian sect numbering about 3,000, claim to be followers of John the Baptist, and are mostly located around ’Amarah. The Nestorian Christians, whose headquarters appear to be at Babylon, desire the British to take more political interest in them and their Church. In fact they wish for official protec tion such as the Chaldeans enjoy from the French. The Russians were said in 1912 to have been anxious to offer them this facility and a section of the Nestorians was then parleying with them. The Shi’ahs of this part have their headquarters at the celebrated shrine of Karbala. They are very hostile towards67 the Russians on account of the latter’s “stringent action” towards their co-religionists, i.e., in Northern Persia, and favour the British. Their power for action and their influence are, however, very limited and they lack capable leaders. Both at Karbala and Najaf (see pages 36 and 37) the Turks have stirred up disturbances. Being themselves Sunnis they are antagonistic to the Shiahs who have their principal Shrines at the above mentioned towns. The outrages committed are not likely to lead the inhabitants to support the Turkish cause. The principal towns (with number of inhabitants or houses shown in brackets) are : — ' Baghdad (145,000). Karbala (65,000). Basrah (33,000). Hillah (30,000). Najaf (12,000)’. Amarah (10,000). Nasiriyah (10,000). Shatrat-al-Muntafik (500 houses). Musaiyib (6,000). Qurnah (5,000). • Kut-al-Amarah (4,000). Diwaniyah, Samawah, Rumaithah (500 houses). Zubair (1,500). Basrah. The population of Basrah, including suburbs, numbers 33,000, mostly composed of sedentary Arabs. Zubair. The population of Zubair is virtually all Sunni Muhammadan as is natural in a place which holds the tomb of Zubair, arch rebel against ’Ali and killed here in fighting against him. Many notables and land-owners of the Basrah neighbourhood have country houses at Zubair, to which they retire in the hot weather in quest of a drier atmosphere; and some important families f]f Central Arabian origin are also located here. Muhammareh. The population of Muhammareh amounts to 23,000, and that of the neighbouring district of Fallahiyeh (’Arabistan) to 45,000. ^ ’Arabistan is potentially one of the richest provinces of Persia, but the country lacks the population necessary to develop its great agricultural resources.tmaammrnm 68 The Arab Tribes of Mesopotamia. The cultivated delta watered by the Tigris and Euphrates is inhabited by Arab tribal confederations, more or less settled, who are immigrants from the Arabian deserts. Some have been established in Mesopotamia from a remote period, others have come in during the last two or three hundred years, but all are originally nomads of the interior wilderness. The unbroken drift of her peoples northwards is one of the most important factors in the history of Arabia. The underlying causes were probably complex, but chief among them must have been a gradual change in the climatic conditions of the peninsula, involving slow desiccation, together with the pres sure of an increasing population on a soil growing steadily poorer. To the hunger-bitten nomad, the rich pastures of the Syrian frontier, the inexhaustible fertility of Mesopotamia, offered irresistible attractions, and opportunities for expansion were found in the weakness and political exhaustion of the neighbouring northern states, whether they were Turkish Byzantine, Persian or yet earlier empires. The long recoi ls of Babylonia enable us to trace the process in its earlier histori cal phases, a study of existing conditions shows that until a recent period it was still going on, and if a forecast may be hazai'ded, it will not be arrested in the future, though the nature of the migration may be altered. Instead of devastat ing hordes, sweeping like locusts over cornfield and pasture, the surplus population of Arabia may find in a Mesopotamia reconstituted by good administration not only abundant means of livelihood but far-reaching possibilities of social and intellectual advance; and they will be received with welcome in a land of which the unlimited resources can be put to profit in proportion to the labour available. The conversion of the wandering camel breeder and camel lifter into a cultivator of the soil, in so far as it has taken place in Mesopotamia, was an inevitable process. In theiift.progress northward the tribes found themselves ultimately upon the limits of the desert; the wide spaces essential to nomadic existence no longer stretched before them, while the pressure of those behind forbade any return. They were obliged ta look to agriculture as a means of livelihood. Thereby they lost caste with the true Badawin, yet, though these last would scorn to intermarry with tillers of the earth, shepherds and herdsmen of buffaloes, they are nevertheless of the same blood69 bates ettled, 2 have others 'S, but . The most rlyiug must , )f the pres- ladily t the amia, nsiou £ the rkish icor-ls stori- itil a ,y be i the istat- ture, laiiaia riant i and icome profit camel i place :ogress in the jmaiic assure ;ed to r th^ would Is and bbod and tradition and not infrequently fragments of very ancient and famous Arabian tribes are present among the cultivators upon the outer limits of Arabian migration. Thus in Mesopo tamia the Bani Tamin, who are divided among various big tribal groups, were masters of the whole of Central Arabia before the time of the Prophet and still form a large part of the Oasis population—their first ajppearance in Mesopotamia dates from about the beginning of the Mohammadan era; and the Khazraj, now found chiefly on the Persian frontier, sup plied by their martial exploits in the southern deserts much of the romantic stock in trade of the pre-Mohammadan poets. It follows from the conditions under which settlement has been effected that the old tribes are often widely scattered along the edges of the cultivated land, large units which once ranged over extensive stretches of desert having been split up and thrust apart by the intrusion of others. For example, the Jubur, a tribe now only half nomadic, are found along the Tigris as far north as Mosul, as well as on the eastern frontiers of Syria, and the Zubaid are divided between Mesopotamia and the volcanic districts east of Damascus. The transition from a nomadic to a settled life is always a slow_ process and the very doubtful security offered by Turkish administration did not tend to hasten it. Except in the immediate neighbourhood of big towns, such as Baghdad and Basrah, tribal organization has not been relinquished, tribal law and customs hold good and tribal blood feuds continue to be a terrible scourge. A periodical reversion to tents is common and even the reed villages are semi-nomadic, shifting frequently from place to place. The puzzled map-maker may find his last addition to geographical knowledge removed, almost before his eyes, from the spot assigned to it in his survey and re-erected on another site. But the rising value of land tends to pin down these restless husbandmen and no sooner do they settle than their numbers increase out of all comparison with those of their hungry if prouder brethren, who neither plough nor harvest tlm wilderness. The Muntafiq confederation occupy 7 an area which in round figures extends 65 miles from east to west and 50 miles from north to south, and number, at a rough estimate, not less than 200,000 souls, whereas the whole of the great Badawin group of the Anazah, which peoples the Syrian desert from Aleppo to the sands of Central Arabia, can scarcely be reckoned at a higher figure.70 The proximity of Persia and the existence in Mesopotamia of Karbala and Najaf, two of the most holy shrines of the Shi’ah sect, to which the Persians belong, with the resulting influx of Persian pilgrims, have brought the country much under Persian influences. Nomad Arabia belongs wholly to the Sunni half of Islam, yet the tribes settled in Mesopotamia have embraced, almost without exception, the Shi’ah faith. Those, however, who maintain purely nomadic habits, “ People of the Camel ” as they proudly call themselves, have kept as a rule to the desert doctrine and are almost invariably Sunni. From the head of the Persian Gulf up to Qurnah, tribal organization has almost died out, except that many of the peasants working in the date gardens belong to khe tribes of our staunch ally on the Persian side of the river, the powerful Shaikh of Muhammareh, who has in the past maintained the right to mobilise them for his own tribal operations. Above Qurnah the country, from Euphrates to Tigris for some distance along the banks of both rivers, is occupied by the Muntafiq, a large and loose confederation of tribes of different origin, all of whom acknowledge, to a less degree or a greater, the over lordship of the Sa’dun clan. These Sa’duns are sprung from a Mecca family closely related to the Sharif, a branch of w r hich migrated to Mesopotamia towards the .close of the Abbasid period, about the beginning of the 15th Century. Themselves Sunnis and of the purest Sunni stock, they established their authority over the Shiah tribes and played a very considerable part in the stormy history of the land. In the case of one scion of the family who had rendered them valuable service in Central Arabia, the Porte even tried the experiment of appoint ing him Wali of Basrah, but it quickly proved a failure and was abandoned. Of late years their power as a ruling family has been gradu ally disintegrating owing to internal rivalries and dissensions, and at present, though several of the leading members of the “ Sa’dun ” possess large estates in the Basrah Wilayat, they are able to exact but a small portion of their dues from their tribal tenantry and as tribal leaders in the field they are now of little account. Their family prestige is still, however, con siderable. The position of the Sa’dun clan as affected by the outbreak of war between Turkey and Great Britain has been a difficult one, for many of them own properties both in the territories71 in British occupation and in those at present controlled by the Turks; but except in the case of two or three irreccncilables their behaviour has on the whole been reasonable and intelligible, and there is little doubt that they will all come into the fold when they are satisfied that Turkish rule has vanished for ever from the Basrah Wilayat. Some part of the Muntafiq is still nomadic; the rest inhabit tents, reed huts, villages, and even towns, cultivate the land and breed sheep, cattle, buffaloes and camels. Many of those who belong to the settled sections roam the desert in spring with their flocks and herds for the sake of pasturage. The tribes of southern Mesopotamia are better armed than those above Kut and the Muntafiq are well provided with modern rifles. Above them, along the course of the Tigris almost up to Kut, lie two large and powerful tribes ranging from the. river to the Persian Hills. Of these A1 Bu Muhammad, a socially inferior and possibly non-Arab people, are rice growers in the marshes on either side of the Tigris and breed immense herds of buffaloes, which are exported in great numbers to Syria. Like all Marsh Arabs they have maintained a semi-independ ence, and, down to the youngest member of the tribe, they are well armed with rifles. The second big group, that of the Bani Lam, have occupied the country above Amarah for the last four or five hundred years. Their Shaikhs claim descent from a famous pre-Muhammadan tribe of Eastern Arabia, but, in spite of their pretensions, none of the Badawin of the inner desert would regard them as equals or intermarry with them. Their most prominent Shaikh, Gadhban, a great rebel against the Ottoman Government before the war, joined the Turks against us, but has now reconsidered his position and most of his house came to terms with us as soon as we advanced up the Tigris. The Bani Lam are cultivators of rice but none of them have entirely abandoned nomad life. They inhabit tents and are generally on the move with their herds from February to June. Their horses and camels are reckoned the best in Meso potamia. They are good shots, especially from the saddle. Round Kut, both on the Tigris and on the upper part of the great Hai canal, which flows out of the river southwards, the Bani Rabi’ah bear sway, a tribe of ancient fame in Arabia. They are a turbulent people, well known robbers and disturbers■MBBBBBHi 72 of traffic along the river, but not so efficiently armed as their neighbours to the south. Still less well provided with rifles and more submissive to control are the two smaller tribes which cultivate the Tigris banks up to Baghdad, the Toqah and the Zubaid, while the inhabitants of the Euphrates marshes above Nasiriyah, though their reputation leaves much to be desired, have not shown themselves ill-disposed towards us. Far down in the scale of civilization as these amphibious dwellers in swamp and reed bed would seem to be, the amazing quickness of the Arab in adapting himself to new conditions and profiting by unexpected opportunities must never be for gotten. A child born yesterday in a reed hut or a black goat’s hair tent may well be found practising medicine or the law in Baghdad before the next quarter of a century is over, and, though his father may prefer to abide by something more nearly resembling the old customs, a solid balance at the bank will.testify that he leads the simple life by choice and not of necessity. • The following is a list of the principal tribes with their approximate fighting strength : — Bawi (Bawiyeh) . . 2,710 Ka’ab .... • 15,722. f Asavireh 4,750 Dria &lt; Ghubaish (A1 Bu) 3,042 (.

The most generally spoken language in Mesopotamia is a form of Arabic which is practically a local dialect. The Turkish officials speak Turkish and some of them French in addition. Hindustani and English are little understood. Persian is largely spoken in some districts—in towns on the Tigris, for example, such as Amarah. The Muhammadan Religion. The cardinal doctrine of the Muhammadan religion, which is called “Islam” (literally “submission to God”), is pure theism, formulated in the words “ There is but one God'.” It also accepts the divine missions of Moses, Christ, and Muham mad. j A final judgment, an after state, a heaven and hell, good and bad spirits, and guardian angels are amongst the tenets of the religion, which inculcates also the virtues of almsgiving, truth, sobriety, and mercy to animals. Its rites include punctilious and ceremonious prayer, ablutions, circumcision, pilgrimage, and abstinence from alcoholic drinks. The holy book of the Muhammadans is the Koran, which is written in Arabic and was compiled from the sayings of the Pro phet. It embodies portions of the Old and New Testaments. Both Christians and Jews are considered as possessing the scriptures, and are called by Moslems “People of the Book.” Of lesser importance than the Koran, but also much vene rated, are the “ Sunnat,” or traditions of the faith. Muhammadans are divided into two main sects—Sunnis and Shi’ahs. Of these the former are generally regarded as the Orthodox party. The Sunnis acknowledge the succession of the first four Khalifahs, Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman, and ’Ali, as rightful successors of Muhammad, and the subsequent Khalifahs down to the present Turkish Sultan. These are all considered to have inherited the sp ; ritual and temporal supremacy bequeathed by the Prophet. The Shi’ahs, who are held to be heretics by the Sunnis, deny the first four Khalifahs and the present succession. They recognize as the first true Imam, ’Ali, who married the74 Prophet’s daughter, Fatimah, and had two sons, Hassan and Husain. These two, early in the history of Islam, took up arms against the reigning Khalifah and were defeated in battle; their dynasty soon ceased to exist. The Shi’ahs now acknowledge no spiritual head, but look for the re-appearance of Imam-al-Mahdi. Their chief temporal prince is the Shah of Persia. In distinction to the Sunnis, who hold that truth can only be found in tradition, they main tain that certain learned doctors have a right to use their judg ment. A third section of Muhammadans are the Wahabis, who are generally akin to the Sunnis, but are reformers of a puritan type. They inhabit Central Arabia. A fourth division are the Moors, who are otherwise Sunnis, but regard their own Sultan as Khalifah. All the chief centres of Islam, i.e., Mecca, Medina, Constan tinople, Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo, Delhi, Kabul and Bokhara, are thus Sunni. The main places of pilgrimage for the Sunnis, are Mecca and Medina in Western Arabia, while the Shi’ahs’ holy cities are Karbala and Najaf to the south of Baghdad, and Meshed, in north-east Persia. The Haj, usually so called, is the Sunni pilgrimage from Constantinople and Cairo to Mecca. But many thousands of Persians and Indians go yearly to Karbala, and sdme, though far fewer, to Mecca. The Muhammadan religion in Turkey differs from most other faiths in having no regular priesthood. The Ulama or “ learned,” * were originally no more than a body of interpreters of the Koran. But as the Koran contains not only the ecclesiastical but also the secular law, this body soon came to exercise a con siderable influence in the councils of the state. This influence has almost invariably been exerted in a spirit hostile to Chris tianity and to general progress. The head of The Ulama is the Shaikh-ul-Islam, an official who in certain mat ters of doctrine, wields a power equal to that of the Sultan himself. Another potentate of great local power is the Grand Sharif of Mecca, who is the head of the Quraish tribe, the hereditary guardian of the holy places, and the feudal chief of half the tribes of Arabia.The Sultan, however, is the Khalifah or accepted spiritual head of Islam, as well as the temporal sovereign of Turkey, and his position and prestige throughout the Muhammadan world are indissolubly bound up with the Khalifate, which itself largely depends on the possession of the holy places in Arabia. The position of the Sultan of Turkey as spiritual head of Islam has been recently affected by the action of the Grand Sharif of Mecca. The latter has thrown off (1916) the authority of the Sultan and expelled some Turkish garrisons.( 76 ) CHAPTER IV. RESOURCES. Water. Kuwait .—See page 47. Umm Qasr .—There are three small wells of brackish water in the Turkish fort about 8 feet deep. It is reported that there are other wells “with a plentiful supply” about 250 yards to the north of the fort. The level of fresh water, which is only slightly brackish, is said to be only 8 feet below the surface. It would probably be advisable to arrange to supplement the water-supply from ships for any body of troops exceeding two battalions. Fao .—At the F_ao telegraph station there are seven tanks, each with a capacity of 400 gallons. Drinking water is also obtained from the Shatt-al-’Arab. Basrah. —Best water is from the open stream of the Shatt-al- ’Arab, but this is not very wholesome owing to drainage from swampy areas. The water from the ’Ashar canal is drunk by the poorer classes. Baghdad.'—In some quarters of the town water is laid on by pipes from the Tigris; the water is pumped up by an oil engine, but no attempt is made to filter it, and the silt is not even allowed to settle. In other parts of the town water is provided by carriers. Many houses have private wells, but the water in these is not sweet and not suitable for drinking; the level in the wells varies with the level of the Tigris. In 1911 estimates were being prepared to provide the town with a proper water-supply. I or water-supply of towns along the Tigris and Euphrates see pages 34 to 38, and also Routes in Chapter VIII. (See page 112.) Ardbistan. The water of the Karun, Diz, and Jarrahi rivers is good and sweet; there is, therefore, no difficulty about scarcity of water at Muhammareh, Ahwaz, or Shushtar, or any where on the routes connecting these places.On the cross route Maksar to Ahwaz water is scarce. At Ramuz water is good and plentiful. Muhammareh .—At Muhammareh the water of the Karun river (i.e., the Hafar canal or Bahmanshir canal) is considered to be better than that of the Shatt-al-’Arab, while both are 'better than the water of the irrigation canals which take off from the rivers. Wells at Muhammareh only contain brackish water. In 1857 water tapped at a depth of 23 feet, one mile inland, was also found to be brackish. Bandar Ma'shur .—At Bandar Ma’shur water is rather scarce and some of it is not good. It consists of the following :— (a) An open tank, to the east of the town, upon which the towns people depend for 8 months of the year. (b) Many small wells in the town with brackish and un healthy water. (c) An underground cistern west of the town with ex cellent water, kept as a reserve. (d) The river Jarrahi with excellent water, but about 15 miles distant. Supplies. ■ General .—There is comparatively little production in this region generally. Dates form the main article of export. The value of grain, barley, and wheat exported in 1909 amounted to ^600,000. The failure of the harvest is a factor always to be reckoned with, both in ’Iraq and ’Arabistan. The average amount of wheat exported from Baghdad during 1907-08-09 was 15,000 tons. Corn is sown about November and December and harvested in May or June. An autumn crop of maize, harvested about December, is often raised as well. In the Baghdad Wilayat in 1905, a tax was levied on 57,000 buffaloes and 122,000 sheep. Supplies in 'Arabistan .—Wheat and barley are exported in large quantities from ’Arabistan during the summer and autumn. Rice is imported from Hindiyan and Fallahiyeh to Muham mareh, where there are large stocks in the bazaar. Dates are the staple food of the country. The districts affording the best supplies are the banks of the Karun river especially above Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful,Fallahiyeh, Hindiyan, and Ramuz. These could provide suffi cient grain for the needs of at least one division. Shushtar alone, which also has many water mills, could probably supply the needs of one division for several months. Ahwaz could probably, support a brigade for a month. Mesopotamia could also provide large supplies of cereals. Sheep, goats and cattle are obtainable in North ’Arabistan, but not so easily in Southern ’Arabistan. Between December and February sheep and goats are difficult to obtain. At Muhammareb there is only one large flour mill. Onions, beans and fish are procurable, and there is a good bazaar for native goods. Milk is scarce. Apples are obtainable in May, melons and dates in August. At Bandar Ma’shur there is scanty grazing, and very little cultivation; fodder is brought from the Jarrahi or Hindiyan dis tricts. Fuel is obtainable from small bushes only, which are cut within a radius of 10 miles. At Ramuz wood-fuel and charcoal are cheap. There are fuel depots for steamers at Ahwaz, Band-i-Qir and Shalaili. Fuel is also abundant at Shushtar and Dizful. At Dizful in spring the grazing is excellent. TRANSPORT. Mechanical Transport. 1 -—Types of vehicles in use. The most important types of vehicles in use in Mesopotamia are the Peerless, the Fiat and the Napier lorries. 2 .—Climatic conditions. I nsuitable climatic conditions constitute one of the prin cipal difficulties which mechanical transport has to contend with in Iraq. The enormous variations in the temnerature of the air—and therefore of its density—make the adjustment of the carburettor, with the fixed mixture preparation, almost impossible. (2) The cooling effect of the radiator is materially reduced, owing to the great heat prevailing in Iraq during the summer months. The engine has, therefore, to work at an unusuallyhigh temperature, and this unfortunate circumstance is aggra vated by the difficulty of obtaining suitable heavy oil. 3.— Conclusion. The general conclusions arrived at by past experience may be summed up as follows with regard to the points named :— (I) Weight on road.—-Should be as small as possible. {2) Bearing surface of wheels .—Should be relatively as large as possible compared with power and weight of car. (3) Tyres. —Should be pneumatic without exception. (4) Springs. —Strong springs absolutely essential, with an extra leaf in addition to the makers’ usual speci fications. This applies both to back and front springs. (5) Shock afraorfrcr-s.—Should be fitted to rear springs. (6) Buffers.- —Buffers such as “ Nevejahs ” should be fitted to all springs in addition to the shock absorbers specified above. (7) Radiators. —Big radiators are absolutely necessary, preferably honeycomb. (8) Adjustable extra air inlets. —Are necessary. (.9) Wheels. —Should be of metal, not wood. (10) Bodies. —Should be light. (11) Spare parts.—These should be at least 15 per cent. This is one of the most important points of all. Baghdad. In the whole of the Baghdad wilayat the number of animals upon which tax was collected in 1905 was— Camels 87,787 Donkeys ... . 67,416 In addition to these classes of animals there are said to be borne annually 85,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 155,000 head of cattle.80 In the town of Baghdad the following could be procured at short notice :— transport animals Donkeys ..... 1,000 Camels . . . , • 1,000 Pack mules and ponies 800 (Together with 80 four-wheeled pilgrim wagons, and 20 local carriages.) Mules can be bought in Mesopotamia, where some 5,000 pack mules are in use. • ' Arabistan. The mule is more suitable than the camel in ’Arabistan, as w T ater and fodder can be got daily, whilst camel grazing is ap parent^ 7 scarce. M'ith at least one month’s notice and the inhabitants friendly, the following transport plight be collected :— Mule*. Camels. Donkeys. Ramuz 200 Shushtar and from Bakhtiaris . . 300 Dizful and from Lurs . . . 1,000 Fallahiyeh and Hindiyan . . . 100 Muhammareh . Caravans, complete with yiative equipment under their own headmen, should be engaged. No bullocks are available in ’Arabistan. For Resources, Kuwait, see page 47. ... 1,000 300 ... 1,000 ... and charvarar Trade. There is comparatively little production in Mesopotamia generally. The date palm constitutes the principal feature in the landscape from Baghdad southwards, and dates form the mam article of export. Opium has, however, of late years shown a considerable increase in production, and the same may be fiom the Persian hills, though the shrub producing this is failing on account of indiscriminate tapping. In 1909 wool was the biggest item of export after dates, but in previous years, and notwithstanding the fact that the most is not madeof the land in an agricultural sense, the value of the barley and wheat exported amounted to over .£600,000 or one-third of the total exports. In 1909, the amount of these cereals was reduced to practically nothing on account of inadequate rainfall during the winter and tribal disturbances. Other articles of export include carpets (mostly from Persia), liquorice and seeds; also an average yearly of 2,000 horses fc&gt; Bombay. The total value of the export trade from Basrah in 1909 amounted to £1,504,000, of which about half came from Bagh dad, and of which about 50 per cent, went to the British Empire. The value of the imports exceeds the value'of the exports by £856,102, the principal items being cotton, silk and woollen goods, and sugar. Nearly the whole of the imports go to Bagh dad, and somewhat over 50 per cent, come from the British Empire. As regards the carrying trade from the port of Basrah, the total tonnage of ships entering and leaving the port amounted in 1909 to 393,491 tons, of which 356,729 was British and 12,728- Turkish. There is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Basrah. The following lines of steamers used to call regularly at Basrah and Muhammareh. The British India Steam Navigation Company, running weekly with Gulf mails from Karachi and Bombay,, and fortnightly with local mails. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, every fortnight from Bombay. The Anglo-Arabian and P*ersian Steamship Company, direct from England. Bucknal Brothers, direct from England. The West Hartlepool Steamship Company, direct from England. The Hamburg-Amerika Line used to sail monthly from Hamburg and Antwerp. A Russian subsidised steamer calls three or four times a • year, and an occasional Austrian-Lloyd. For the date season numerous steamers are chartered.The European firms with offices at Basrah are :— (i) Lynch and Company. Employed in the carrying trade up Tigris and Karun rivers. (u) Gray, Mackenzie and Company. Shipping Agents. (Hi) Strick and Company. Shipping. (iv) MacAndrew, Forbes and Company, American firm. Exporters of liquorice. (v) Basrah Trading Company, British firm. Exporters of dates and grain. (vi) Russian Steamship and Trading Company, of Odessa, also has an agency. In addition several Bombay firms have opened branches in Basrah since the British occupation. Three British (European) firms had agencies in Baghdad :— 1. Messrs. Lynch and Co., of the Euphrates and Tigris There were several German firms. A branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank is located in Bagln dad and there are three steam factories, for cloth, ice and corn, respectively. For trade of Kuwait see page 49.CHAPTER V. NOTES ON THE TURKISH ARMY. Introduction. Constitution of the Ottoman Empire. Evolution of the present Army system. The Ottoman Empire consists of about 7,000 square miles in the south-east of the Balkan Peninsula; Asia Minor proper, or the Peninsula of Anatolia; Eastern Turkey in Asia, bordering the frontiers of the Caucasus and Persia, with Syria and parts of Arabia. The territory of the Empire is divided into vilayets (pro vinces), sub-divided into sanjaks (districts), again sub-divided into kazas (sub-districts), with a still further division into nahies (parishes). Each vilayet is ruled by a vali, or governor-general, assisted by a provincial council, who exercises authority in all administrative affairs, except legal and military. The dis tricts, sub-districts, and parishes are under mutesarrifs, kainjp,- kams, and mudirs, respectively. There ai'e also several in dependent sanjaks. Turkey in Europe comprises two vilayets and one independent sanjak'. Turkey in Asia twenty-three vilayets and four in dependent sanjaks. The form of government is now, as the result of the “Young Turk ” movement of 1908, a constitutional monarchy tempered by a permanent and irresponsible court-martial, with a parlia ment composed of a nominated senate and an elected second chamber. Although, however, the temporal power of the Sultan has been thus restrained within constitutional limits, his spiri tual position as the Khalifa, or successor of Mohammed, remains undiminished. It is true that he is not recognized as such over the whole Mohammedan world, but his claim is undisputed by most of the Sunni branch of the faith, and it gives him an enor mous influence over his own Moslem subjects; it invests the wars waged by him against Christian Powers with a religious character, and it is never forgotten by the Turk that his enemy is not merely a foreigner but an infidel.84 Executive authority is exercised directly under the Sultan by the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet, whose officers collectively form the Sublime Porte. Religious and certain legislative authority is exercised, under the Sultan as Khalifa, by the Sheikh, ul Islam, who is the inter preter of the Sheri or sacred Mohammedan laws. Secular law, applicable alike to Moslems and Christians, is administered by the Department of Justice presided over by a minister. The administration of the Army, formerly exercised by two functionaries, the Minister of War and the Grand Master of the Ordnance, is now vested entirely in the former. Until the year 1826 the Janissaries (Yeni Cheri, the new sol diers) were the chief military force in Turkey, and no Ottomans, except the holders of certain military fiefs and their retainers, were specially liaible to service. The corps was originally formed about 1335, or some hundred and twenty years before the cap ture of Constantinople, by the enslavement of Christian children. Every four yours a fifth of all the male children between the ages of six and nine were selected from the Christian villages in the Turkish Empire; they were taken to the capital, educated as Mohammedans, and entirely removed from their early associa tions. The majority passed into military service in one of the 196 “ formations ” or companies, of which the corps of Janissaries eventually consisted. They were forbidden to marry or engage in trade, and were fed, clothed, and paid by the Sultan. The original constitution of the corps endured, however, less than a century; radical changes were introduced, the members were allowed to marry, their children were permitted to join the service, and the children of Moslems were enlisted. The levy of Christian children ceased altogether towards 1670. The Janis saries gradually lost their special character and became merely privileged troops; their conduct deteriorated, and, by their insubordination, turbulence, and disorder, they provoked popu lar disapproval. Unable to reform them Sultan Mahmud, in 1826, decreed their extermination and the destruction of the quarter in which they lived. It was not, however, -until 1843 that a regular form of service was inaugurated, with an active Army (Nizam) and a reserve Army (Redif). After the 1854 and 1878 wars with Russia, Reorganization was effected, and a continental territorial system was introduced ini 85 &gt;he Sultan Mllectivelj sed, under the inter, cular lav, istered by bj two ;er of tie new sol- ttomans, 'etainers, y formed the cap- children, the ages s in the rated as associa- s of the lissaries engage .. er, less iembers |oin the levy of s Janis- merely y their d popu- ud, in of the Eorm of I and a ion was iced in 1886 on the recommendations of Colonel Von der Goltz, a German* general staff officer, specially lent as adviser to the Ottoman War Office. This system, under which the Empire was divided into seven ordus or militarv districts, held good with certain modifica tions up to the year 1911, when, following upon the further advice of Colonel (now Marshal) Von der Goltz, who, with a staff of German officers, was engaged after the constitutional crisis of 1908 for a fresh term, the organization described in the present hand-book was adopted. Prior to the adoption of the new organ ization, the liability to compulsory service had been extended to the whole Empire, thereby drawing in the Christian portion of the population and also Moslems from Constantinople, Albania, Arabia, and certain other localities who had been hitherto exempt. The introduction of the law applying conscription to the Christians was at first the occasion of much controversy and recrimination, and the Christians themselves_ showed little enthusiasm to serve in the army. But that the intention of the- government was to give the measure a fair trial and to treat ttie non-Moslem soldiers well may be inferred from the fact that, when they were first enrolled, stringent orders were issued to officers, and special precautions were taken to ensure a good reception from their Moslem comrades. In the Balkan War the Armenians fought well; the Slavs and Greeks were naturally unreliable. In 1914 and 1915 the great majority of Christians and Jews enrolled were drafted into unarmed labour battalions, used foi road making, etc. In general, the last years certainly contained some progress for the Turkish Army on modern lines. A good system of train ing and instruction has been instituted, which has given satis factory results, and though the Balkan W 7 ar inflicted grave losses of recruiting grounds, men, and material, upon the lurkis Army, the reoccupation of Adrianople somewhat improvec the shaken morale of the Officers’ Corps. Since 1913 the Turkish Army has been subjected to intensive- German training under the auspices of a German military mis sion under General Eiman von Sanders Pasha, composed of some seventy German officers. This number was increased six oi sevenfold between August 1 and December 1, 1914.86 On October 29, 1914, hostilities commenced between Turkey and the Allied Powers : Great Britain, France, Russia, Servia, Montenegro, and Belgium. Terms of service. By the Law of 1914, the terms of service are as follows :— Years.

Vth Vlth and VTIffi 8 A° St ’ W&amp;S the , entire artillery of theSince January 1, 1913, the Turks have partially replaced their losses as follows :— (1) About thirty-six Servian Schneider-Canet guns, on which an embargo was laid before the outbreak of war with the Balkan League, were seized at Salonica, sent to Constantinople, and later supplied to the Turkish forces behind the Tchataldja lines. (2) Twenty-two batteries of field guns and the eighteen batteries of mountain guns previously ordered were delivered. (3) An unknown number, of 'field guns qaptured by the Bulgars were recaptured by the Turks when they reoccupied Adrianople. (4) Large orders for guns were made after the Balkan War, and many of these guns were delivered at Constanti nople in the autumn of 1914. These included many 10‘5 cm., 12 cm., and 15 cm. pieces. Others, in cluding some heavy Austrian pieces, are said to have arrived via Roumania in 1915. There can be no doubt that many guns were given to Turkey by the German and Austro-Hungarian Governments after the outbreak of the European War in August 1914. Guns of various types and calibres kept arriving in small numbers from Central Europe through Bulgaria and Roumania till the early summer of 1915. Fighting qualities of local Arabs of Mesopotamia. Of the tribes, the largest and most powerful is the Muntafik. No estimate of the Muntafik is available, but they had 1,500 men in rebellion against the Turks at one time. Shaikh Sa’adun, the late Chief of the Muntafik, collected, in 1910, against the Kuwait forces, from his own followers and other tribes, some 4,000 horsemen, and a large number of dismounted men (no num bers given), but no thaluls (riding camels). The Muntafik carry in war swords and lances. They are also armed with rifles, chiefly Martinis. In ftie past they have been in rebellion against the Turkish Government.unwni i 90 The Bani Lam Arab tribe is also usually in a state of passive resistance towards the Turks. They have recently (1914) had trouble with the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The tribes in the Basrah Wilayat, generally, # have probably as many rifles as they can afford to buy. The favourite pattern is the Martini, but there is also a sprinkling of Mausers. Where breech-loaders are deficient, the favourite substitute is a double- barrelled muzzle-loading gun. Other weapons are swords, 12- foot lances with a formidable blade, curved daggers about a foot long, doub^-edged, and very sharp at the point. For several years the Arabs have been very friendly towards the British, and on several occasions prominent chiefs have come forward with suggestions of a British Protectorate. Kuwait. Kuwait Forces. The Kuwait unit of organization is the khabra. A khabra consists of 10 men with their arms and probably 100 rounds of ammunition each. 7 thaluls or riding camels, with their equipment. Food for as many days as may be ordered. The expedition organized in 1910, against the Muntafik may be taken as a guide towards the maximum probable strength of the Kuwait forces, viz. :— 600 khabras .... 6,000 Unorganized Bedouins 6,000 Probably at the disposal of the Shaikh from more southern tribes 4,000 Probable maximum total 16,000 thaluL. Many rifles and much ammunition have reached Kuwait from Masqat, during 1911—14, and the followers of the Shaikh of Kuwait are well armed. Defence of Kuwait. A line of sand-hills and somewhat'broken ground, about a mile outside the town, affords a fairlv satisfac-tory line of defence, and might be made strong enough by suit able preparation to resist any probable attack. The line ex tends in an arc, enclosing the town on the land side, with both flanks resting on the sea, and capable of being supported by naval fire, though at a somewhat long range, i.e., up to 4,000 and 5,000 yards. Certain conspicuous points, shown on the chart, facilitate the direction and ranging of ship’s fire from the sta tions indicated by the names of the ships told off to these posi tions in 1901-02, viz., His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx, ” His Majesty’s ship “ Pomone, ” and His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast.” In addition to this strictly naval support,.native dhows if armed with machine guns, would be useful in shoal water on either flank and would be able to bring fire to heal' at a much shorter range than those mentioned with reference to the ships. Starting from the right or western flank of this defensive line it runs (a) along certain existing excavations and old wells, for a distance of about 1,500 yards (b) thence in a north-easterly direction along the outer edge of a strip of broken ground, broken apparently by what seem to be disused lime pits, offering cover, and capable of adaptation, and thence (c) trending more to the north, over level open ground, the line would have to be con structed with a trench or otherwise, closing on the sea near Ras- al-’Ajuzah. . The extent of front thus taken, up is approximately b,90U yards, and, as has been said, could he supported on both flanks by fire from ships, which would be able to bring a cross nre to bear, though at long range, in front of the centre of the position. Such was the line of defence selected by the Senior Naval Officer in 1901, when it seemed possible that an attack might be imminent. ’Aeabistan. Regulars .—No regular Persian troops of any fighting value exist in ’Arabistan. Irregulars .—The tribesmen with whom we must be prepared to deal are :— * (1) The Arabs of ’Arabistan. (2) The Bakhtiaris. (3) The Kuhgalus. (4) The Lurs, including the Sagwand _ and Dirakwand Bairanwand and the Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh.■MMMHBHi The probability of these tribes acting in concert against us is slight. In the event of hostilities between us and any one of the above, the others would probably seek to benefit by adopt ing a friendly attitude towards us. The Bakbtiaris and the Kuhgalus both dislike the Arabs, whilst the Bakbtiaris distrust the Kuhgalus, and all are usually at enmity with the Lurs. Again, internal dissensions in the tribes themselves still further decrease the likelihood of united resistance to our forces. For instance, the Bani-Lam are potential enemies of the Shaikh. They never have fought, nor are ever likely to fight, under his banner. The Bakhtiaris, also, are divided into two rival factions. The inhabitants of the towns, though quarrelsome, are not formidable. The Arabs of ’Arabist an .—They are remarkably mobile, whether on foot or on horseback, and are but little hampered by questions of supply. They are fairly well armed, but in different shots and poor fighters. The Shaikh of Muham- mareh is paramount in South ’Arabistan, but he has not much power over the tribes west of the Karun whilst he has practically no influence at all over the Arabs of North ’Arabistan. Pro vided that absolute unanintity existed they could put into the field about 30,000 men arfned with serviceable rifles. In 1912 and again in 1913 the Shaikh of Muhammareh collected about 5,000 Arabs at Ahwaz, who were well supplied with arms, in cluding a maxim gun. They were intended for use against the Bakhtiaris. The Balihtiaris. They are not efficient in a military sense but are good guerilla fighters at a distance if their retreat is safe. They would be better in defending their own hill country than in operating in the plains of ’Arabistan. Internal dis putes would probably prevent them acting in concert Thev W always looked to England for protection and assistance, but would be ready to serve the highest bidder whoever he was They could put into the field about 5,000 men fairly well armed and another 10,000 armed with most indifferent guns. About half of these would be mounted. Th ?. K ufyalus.-—They are disunited by hitter feuds.

Their country is very inhospitable and consequently they indulge in much raiding on their neighbours. The Faili Luts .— They are a simple-minded people, wiry and enduring. They are never so pleased as when engaged in a foray. ^ J-hey are said to trust the word of an Englishman, and to dislike and despise the Persians. They are to be found chiefly in Pusht-i-Kuh. The Sagvand and the Dirakvand .—Relations between these two tribes and the Faili Lurs are good. In days gone by there have been frequent quarrels with the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, but they seem to have forgotten these and to look upon the Wall as their protector. In 1912 the Lurs were verv unfriendly over the survey operations for the Muhammareh-Khurramabad Railway. The Fail! Lurs and the Sagvand and Dirakvand could, if united, put into the field about 20,000 armed men. Arms come into the country from Baghdad. Most Lurs come down to the low country round Dizful in the winter. The Bairanvand is a turbulent tribe living between Khur- ramabad and Burujird and therefore rather remote. . Whilst it is impossible to foretell what the attitude of the tribes will be, yet the following opinion is given as to their probable action. I he Arabs of Northern ’Arabisjtan and those west of the Karun might conceivably refuse to side with the Shaikh and us. The well known, propensities of the Lurs, Bakhtiaris and the Kuhgalus for guerilla warfare render them averse from committing themselves far out on the plains of Southern ’Arabistan. It is unlikely that they would make common cause with the Arabs of North ’Arabistan in opposing our advance. The mutual distrust that exists makes it probable that each will concentrate for the protection of their respective homes. It seems then, that an advance on Shushtar and Dizful would be opposed by Arabs of North ’Arabistan, perhaps assisted by some Lurs and Bakhtiaris, whilst an advance in the direction of Ram Hormuz might expect to encounter resistance from Arabs of North ’Arabistan perhaps supported by a few Kuhgalus. D• The probable action of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh must also be considered. He is strong and influential, even in the neigh bourhood of Dizful, and could exercise considerable control over the Sagvand and the Dirakvand. In the past, he has expressed a desire to ally his interests with those of the British. Under the circumstanced, it should not be difficult to secure his neu trality if not his co-operation, especially if he saw that his friend and ally, the Shaikh of Muhammareh, was on our side. He is reported to be negotiating with the Turks. In 1910 an alliance was formed between the Shaikh of Muhammareh, some of the Haji Ilkhani branch of the Bakhti- aris. Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh and Saulat- ud-Dauleh, Qashqai. The object of the league was to protect the members against the Bakhtiari Government. In 1914 the alliance was confirmed. The defences of Muhammareh are hardly worth considering; they consist of 5 miscellaneous brass pieces at the eastern end of the town overlooking the river, and a ruined mud wall on the landward side of the town. In 1859 the Persians had erected 4 well-constructed batteries on the mainland, and 5 of ’Abbadan Island opposite the town. These had casemates and embra sures. There are 11 old guns in front of the Shaikh’s palace at Failiyeh, but only two of these are fit even for saluting purposes.CHAPTER VI. MARITIME. Turkish naval strength.

Above Baghdad navigation of the Tigris is usually only by rafts, though small steamers can go up to Samarra; below Baghdad steamers and sailing vessels are used. Of late years the navigation has been getting increasingly difficult owing to neglect of dredging operations, the want of supervision over the local Arabs, who cut channels and primitive canals in various unscientific ways, thereby causing the river to silt up or open into broad shallows at embarrassing places, and to the insufficiency of steamer traffic which would help largely to keep open the existing channels. Between Kut-al-Amarah and Baghdad all steamers stick frequently at times when the river is low and have to be hauled laboriously through shallow and winding channels, by means of anchors and winches. About the middle of November, sooner or later, according to the season, rain causes the first rise in the river, and navigation improves. In January, February and March, rain keeps the river fairly full, although the frost in the mountains may lower it. In March, the snows up country begin to melt and the river to rise, as much as 3 feet being recorded on one occasion in a single night at Baghdad. In April and May the river is at its highest. In July and August it falls gradually, because the melting of the snows on the higher ranges keeps up a fairly constant supply of water. In August, September and October, the river is at its lowest but, in the last two months navigation is easier owing to the channels having become formed and known. The current in the low season is slight, and in flood the ■swiftest is about 4 miles an hour in the open reaches of the middle river. Sudden freshets come down while the river is rising, but do not continue long or cause much difficulty to the navigation. Speaking generally, vessels which draw more than 4 to 5 feet of water cannot ascend the river above Qurnah, except when it is in flood. There are no difficulties between Basrah and 'Qm’nah, but the draught of vessels proceeding to Qurnah islimited to 10 feet in the Low Water Season. Between Qurnah and ’Amarah is the most difficult stretch of the river for navi- gation. The following is a description of the river in detail, by sections: — Baghdad to Kut-al-Amarah .—Between Baghdad and Kut the distance by water is 213 miles, though the distance by land, neglecting the sinuosities of the river, is orfly 128 miles. Bagh dad stands at 112 / 50 feet above mean sea level, while the level of Kut is 55'43 feet. In this reach of .the river navigation at low water is impeded owing to the existence of shoals, but is practically uninterrupted. The width of the river may be taken as 380 yards, with a depth of 26 feet in flood, diminishing to 61 feet in low supply. The velocity in flood is 4 miles, and in low supply 11 miles, per hour. At Kut the Hai branch, itself the ancient Tigris, leaves the right bank of the river. Kut-al-Amarah to ’Amarah .—Between Kut and ’Amarah the distance by river is 153 miles, as against a direct land route of 139 miles. The fall in the level of the land is 28 feet, Kut being 55'43 feet and ’Amarah 27 / 19 feet above mean stea level. In this reach navigation is &lt;easy all the year round. The width of the river may be taken as 330 yards, with a depth of 26 feet in flood diminishing to 61 feet in low supply. In this reach the first of the branches which deprives the Tigris of a large supply of water is met with on the right bank above ’Amarah. This branch is known as the Bitara. ’Amarah to Qurnah .—Between ’Amarah and Qurnah the dis tance by river is 86 miles as against 70 miles by the direct land route. 'The fall in the level of the country is 18 feet ’Amarah being 27'19 feet and Qurnah 10'49 feet above mean sea level. In this reach the Tigris experiences many vicissitudes, and it is here that all the difficulties of navigation are to be found. At ’Amarah, on the left bank of the river, the Jahalah (pronounced Chahaleh) branch leaves the Tigris, with its bed about 61 feet lower than that of the Tigris itself. The width of the river averages 197 yards, with a depth of 13 feet in flood, diminishing to 61 feet in low supply. A short distance down stream from ’Amarah on the right bank the Major Kabir leaves the Tigris. Immediately below it on the left bank the Machaira branch takes off.

In the reach below Qalat Salih, after all those branches and overflows have left the river, the Tigris itself is about 66 yards wide, with a depth of 13 feet in high flood, and 6£ feet in low supply. In this whole reach navigation is extremely difficult at low water. Steamers have to be handled with considerable skill and are delayed again and again. In some years the large steamers have had to suspend their running, the mails being con veyed in launches. This stage of the river continues to near Ezra’s Tomb. Here the waters, which have left the river by various branches, enter it again through the swamps, and the river gradually swells its volume, so that at Qurnah it is some 196 yards wide, with a depth of 19£ feet: the water being nearly free of deposit and of a dark transparent colour and marshy odour. The effect of the contrary current due to the tide from the Persian Gulf is felt up to Qurnah though the tide helps to swell the river to near Ezra’s Tomb. Qurnah to Basrah .—Between Qurnah and Basrah, on a length of 47 miles, the river is from 270 yards to 600 yards wide, with a depth of 26 to 45 feet. In ancient days Qurnah was the point of junction of the Euphrates and Tigris, but now it is Gurmat ’Ali. A little Tigris water may occasionally travel up to the Euphrates from Qurnah, but no Euphrates water reaches that place. A little below Qurnah, on the left bank, the Shatt-as-Suwaib, which brings in the waters of the Karkheh and the marshes, joins .the river which, though known from Qurnah to Fao as the Shatt-al-’Arab is, till Gurmat ’Ali is reached, in reality the Tigris alone. A short distance above Basrah, on the right bank, the Euphrates flows into the Tigris at Gurmat ’Ali. Where the two rivers meet, the Tigris may be taken as 415 yards wide and 33 feet deep, and the Euphrates as 207 yards wide and 80 feet deep. (But see the description of the bar at the junction of the two rivers on p. 17.) The water of the Euphrates at this point has no deposit, and presents an opaque and wholesome look, in marked contrast to the dark marshy water of the Tigris. Immediately below the junction the river increases to a width of 600 yards, with a depth of 50 feet. Basrah is 7 ; 54 feet above mean sea level, and the extreme difference between high and low water, as affected by the tide and by the discharge of the river itself is about 10 feet, extreme100 high water being about 8 feet above mean sea, and low water minus 1J feet. For full report of the journey between Baghdad and Basrah and the country on either side adjacent to the river, see page 136. Navigation of tributary streams. The Diyalah is navigated by Tigris sailing craft as far as Ba’qubah about 50 miles above its junction with the Tigris; steamers might also ascend to this point, but, above this, the river becomes shallow, with a wide gravelly channel, and is not navigable. The Shatt-al-Hai is a branch of the Tigris, leaving that river at Kut-al-Amarah and joining the Euphrates near Suq-ash- Shuyukh; it is navigable from February to June and is used by native craft for the export of corn grown in the rich district through which it passes. These boats average 80 tons burthen and draw 5 feet of water. At other seasons the Shatt-al-Hai is not navigable, and from July to November the bed is in many places dry. There are no bridges over the stream. Euphrates navigation. Although, as stated, the river is little used for navigation at the present time, it appears from recent reports that a good deal could be done in this respect even in the existing state of the river. The position would be materially improved if the irri gation projects proposed by Sir William Willcocks are carried out, for it must be remembered that Sir William’s proposals include schemes in connection with regulating and distributing the water, not only of the Tigris, but also of the Euphrates, in fact the work suggested touches the question of the Euphrates just as much as that of the Tigris. Some years ago, in 1903, Mr. Dobbs* was of opinion that the navigation of the Euphrates, except for sailing vessels, was impossible below Musaiyib, and that in any case the river was useless for the transport of troops from the Gulf northwards to Baghdad. On the other hand Sir W. Willcocks reported in 1905+ that the Euphrates was navigable throughout the year from Qurnah to * Report by Mr. Dobbs,' I.C.S., on the Navigation oi the Euphrates, January, 1903. f The Irrigation of Mesopotamia, 1905.Samawah and up the Hindiyah “canal” to the Hindiyah barrage, near Musaiyib, for boats drawing about 3 feet of water. From the barrage to Fallujah, navigation was also open all the year round to ordinary native boats drawing 4 feet. This opinion was generally confirmed in April, 1909, by Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsay, the British Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, w T ho undertook a journey by steamer on the Euphrates in that year from the Hindiyah barrage to Qurnah. Officials in the employ of Messrs. Lynch also performed similar journeys in December, 1908, and May, 1909. Their investiga tions showed that navigation was practicable for shallow- draught steamers (3 to 4 feet draught) during the months stated, which, however, as in the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Ramsav’s journey, coincide with the period during which the river is normally at its highest. It is not clear that, without irrigation improvements, navigation would be practicable during the low- water season. It must be noticed, further that in the two proceeding opinions the so-called Hindiyah “ c^nal ” is utilized; this extends from just south of Musaiyib to Samawah and is held by many to have been originally the true course of the Euphrates. t The following account of the course of the river is taken generally from the reports by Sir W. Willcocks and Lieutenant- Colonel Ramsay. From Fallujah to Musaiyib, a distance of some 56 miles, the average width of the river is 270 'yards. The trough of the Euphrates is 10 feet deep, down to the level of low supply, and a flood of 11£ feet puts the country under 1^ feet of water, against which it is protected by somewhat ineffective dykes. The depth at low water (autumn) in this stretch is 6|- feet and in flood (spring) is 18 feet: velocity of stream (January), 3 feet per second. At Musaiyib is a dangerous curve which needs heavy protective works. Below Musaiyib is the head of the Hindiyah “ canal.” (See Hindiyah Barrage, page 30.) From Hindiyah to Kifl, both banks of the canal are-cultivated with water-lifts, and also by some minor canals. Hindiyah is a prosperous place, and the point of debarkation for Karbala. It contains large quantities of rice and numerous sailing craft. Kifl is a small place.102 t A short distance below Kifl the canal divides into two, the right branch, now silting up, goes to Kufah, from which place Najaf draws its water-supply. The other branch which is the best to follow goes to Hamidiyah, a prosperous place with a boat bridge. Twenty miles below Hamidiyah is the village of Khazam and 4 miles below this the lake of Shinafiyah is entered with a depth of over 3 feet. Nine hours’ steaming at 5 to 6 miles an hour between high banks is taken to reach Samawah from the end of the lake. . At Samawah the course of the “ Euphrates,” as distinguish ed from the canal, joins the “ canal ” from where it branches off below Musaiyib. As before remarked, whether or not this or the canal is the original course of the river is a matter of doubt, but in any case the “ river ” stretch is impracticable for navigation at the present time, being dry for 2| months in the year, and having quite an insignificant width at the end of the reach. From Samawah to Suq-ash-Shuyukh the length is 120 miles. After passing Samawah and before reaching Nasiriyah, the water, freely overflows the banks and forms extensive swamps, the channel naturally diminishing in size. From Nasiriyah to Madinah the Euphrates is navigable for shallow-draught craft all the year round; steamers and gun boats usually perform the passage in 14 to 2 days. The channel (Saffa) to Madinah, leading from 2 or 3 miles above Suq-ash-Shuyukh, passes through the lake of Hamar, and emerging from there, it runs through swamps with thick reeds on each side. The Hamar Lake is very shallow. Entrance to the lake .—This is very narrow, and in the low water season there is not room for even two small vessels to pass, and in the high water season, it would not be advisable. The entrance is over a bad bar on the edge of the lake, carrying about two feet in the low water season, sufficient to hold up all steaming craft. Navigation here is complicated by a bad bend on the bar itself. There is (May 1916) a post with red flag marking the bar, and two black and white posts mark the starboard side of the channel which must be left close to star board. To a stranger, in the high water without these marks, the channel would not be apparent, but in the low water it is well defined. The tract across the lake is devious, and a strangercould not attempt the navigation until he had acquired suffi cient local knowledge. Off Beni Hoteit there is a two feet bar in the low water- season, which held up all steam traffic, during the 4 months September to December in 1915 and 8 miles east of Hakeika there in a similar bar. Navigation across the Hammar Lake, under existing circum- .stances, may be summarised as follows: — (1) In the high water season there are no difficulties for shallow draught vessels. (2) In the low water season, all navigation is suspended, except for heliums i Very strong North winds (Shamals) are prevalent on the Lake, and sand haze renders it difficult to pick up land marks, thus frequently compelling vessels to anchor, until the horizon is clear. From Madinah to Qurnah, where the Tigris is joined, there is a deep channel, the swamps continuing on both sides. The real course of the Euphrates is said by some to be the water channel which runs from Madinah on the edge of the “ Khor ” or open yrater to Gurmat ’Ali, 10 miles above Basrah and there connects with the Tigris, but the navigation by this route is through extremely difficult and complicated reaches, practicable only for the smaller native boats. On April 7th, 1915, it was reported that S' 6' was the maximum draught with which it was possible to cross the bar at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. An experienced river captain thought that steamers could not cross in the low water season and that the channel was only practicable for small boats. For navigation of Shatt-al-’Arab see pages 17 and 110. NAVIGATION IN ’ARABISTAN. Steamers of 2' 6' draft run up the Karun to within 7 miles of Shushtar, and up the Ab-i-Diz to within 14 miles of Dizful. Ballams carrying 5 tons can be towed up the Jarrahi river to Khalafabad, and up the Hindiyan river to Deh Mulla. See Chapter VIII, page 112. Muhammareh.

Communication to the shore is by means of ballams, bagha- lahs, lighters and barges, of which the following are available, in addition to 5 tugs, one of which is suitable for heavy towing.

A supply of 30 feet planks is necessary. Date palm logs are available for building piers, etc., and barges might be used as pontoons. Landing is muddy w'ork, but not difficult except for animals. Landing should not be attempted during strong ebb tides. The rise of tide is 6—9 feet. The following wharves would be useful for landing stores, etc. Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s jetty on ’Abbadan Island at which steamers drawing 25 feet can berth. Customs wharf, Muhammareh . 50 yards, long. Lynch’s wharf, Muhammareh . 50 do. Nasim Company . . . .No details. About 200 coolies are always available.105 Umm Qasr. Anchorage .—There is good anchorage in 10 fathoms ^ mile from the shore, at a spot 2 miles south-east of the fort. Abreast of the fort there is only 3 to 4 feet of water at high tide. The anchorage may be considered sheltered as, although the country around is low-lying, the anchorage is practically a land locked area % mile square. Ten vessels, such as H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” or such as the British India Company’s ships usually employed in the Persian Gulf, could anchor in it in any forma tion considered desirable. There is good holding ground, a sandy muddy bottom. There is no strong sweep of tide or current and there are no dangers in the anchorage basin. Boats could not get shelter from hostile fire, but ship’s guns would command the whole country around, it being flat and open. • Landing .—The shore opposite the anchorage is fairly steep and not swampy, there being a good, dry bank of firm, gravelly soil, 20 feet above high water level, and only 200 yards from high water mark. The distance between high and low water marks at this point is very small. There is no marshy ground on the foreshore here. Above high water mark the beach is practically unlimited inland. There are no obstacles to the movements of troops. Horses or mules would have to swim ashore unless flats and a jetty were used. A landing jetty could be made, there being good holding for piles, but no materials are available locally. There are no boats to be had locally, but plenty could be got from Kuwait (see page 47). Steam and motor launches could be used. The country around is flat and open and Jabal Sanam, 8 miles north-west of Umm Qasr, would be a good situation for a visual signalling station to communicate with Umm Qasr and Basrah. For Umm Qasr see also pages 41 and 128. Kuwait Bay. Anchorages .—The whole bay affords a good anchorage for big Kuwait ships, with excellent holding ground. Soundings106 are: 14 fathoms off Ras-al-Ardh, 6 to 10 fathoms off Ras-al- Ajuzah, shoaling to 6 and 7 fathoms at the entrance of Dohat Kadhamah. Starting from Ras-al-Ardh, the coast-line forms a bay with shallow water as far as Ras-al-’Ajuzah, a low point 6 miles to the north-westward. Native boats anchor 2 miles to the south east of this point, in shelter from the shamal. The approach to the entrance to the bay, though it lies through shoals and low-lying sandbanks, is not difficult. The harbour is buoyed and light is shown On the British, Agency flagstaff. There is a beacon on the Ras-al-Ardh. The anchorage for large ships off the town of Kuwait lies li or 1£ miles off the north end of the town, and west-north west of it, in from 3£ to 4 fathoms. From Ras-al-’Ajuzah the coast runs 9 miles south-west by west to the bottom of a shallow bay called Dohat Abu lali. At the entrance of this small bay there is a little barren islet, Jazirat Qurain, about i mile from the shore. South-east of this is a small basin with 2 fathoms of water, in which the smaller native boats lie, quite sheltered from all winds. Between Qurain Island and the eastern mainland is the Bandar Shuwaikh creek, with a good depth of water. Dohat Kadhamah is the name of the bay west of Ras Ashairij. It shoals gradually from 7 fathoms at the entrance, which is 4 miles wide. (This part of Kuwait Bay, until recently, was very imperfectly surveyed, especially with respect to Ras Kadhamah.) Ras Kadhamah is a low swampy point only just above high water, running out some 3 furlongs from the northern shore of the bay. It is partially protected by a bank of sand, naturally formed, along high water line. About % mile inland from the point, as also all along this coast-line, the shore is sandy, and covered with tussocks of coarse grass, gradually rising to the foot of the Zor hills which are about 200 feet high. There is good holding ground everywhere in Kuwait Bay, but the best an chorage is undoubtedly in Kadhamah Bay, because it is the most sheltered. There appears no reason to doubt that this anchorage could easily be converted into an excellent harbour for sea-going ships by a certain amount of dredging and the construction of jetties and moles. See also page 43.CHAPTER VII. ADMINISTRATION. General. —For purposes of government the locality was, divided into two vilayats, those of Baghdad and Basrah. In the Turkish system of administration, territory is divided into vilayats, these being again divided into sanjaqsthe sanjaqs into qadhas, and the qadhas into nahiyahs. At the head of the vilayat is the vali (either a military man or a civilian, or both combined), at the head of a sanjaq is a mutasarif, at the head of a qadha a qaim-maqam, and at the head of a nahiyah a mudir. The vilayat of Baghdad is divided into three sanjaqs, Bagh dad, Diwaniyah and Karbala. South of a line through Kut-al- Amarah and Samawah commenced the Basrah vilayat divided into four sanjaqs, i.e., Basrah, Muntafik, ’Amarah and A1 Hasa. There was no definite line west between the limits of the Basrah vilayat and the independent tribes of the Arabian tableland; and the A1 Hasa district on the western shores of the Persian Gulf is separated from the remainder of the Basrah vilayat by the ter ritory of the Shaikh of Kuwait and in 1913 virtually ceased to be under Turkey. The population of the whole of the Baghdad and Basrah vilayats is estimated at an approximate number of 1,047,000 or about 9 or 10 to the square mile. The Basrah vilayat. —The vilayat was administered by a vali, headquarters at Basrah. In the Basrah viliyat the sanjaqs of Basrah and Muntafik were divided into qadhas as follows: — The Basrah qadha, being the headquarter qadha, was adminis tered personally by the wali of Basrah. Basrah sanjaq. Qurnah. Basrah. Fao. Muntafik sanjaq. Nasiriyah. Shatrat-ul-Muntafik. Suq-ash-Shugukh. Hai. ( 10T )108 The following were the nahiyahs of the Basrah qadha: — Basrah town. Zubair town. Harthah (north of Basrah). ’Abdul Khasib (Basrah to Za’n). Shatt-al- Arab (left bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab to Persian territory). The Fao qadha was small, and was believed not to be sub divided into nahiyahs. At Basrah His Majesty’s Government was represented by a Consul and at Baghdad by a Consul-General, who was also Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. ’Arabistan. Persian territory met the Shatt-al-’Arab nahiyah of the Basrah qadha on the left bank of the river Shatt-al-’Arab. This part of the Turco-Persian border was demarcated early in 1914, and the boundary follows the Shatt-al-’Arab as far as the upper entrance of the Di’aiji creek, 6£ miles by river above the mouth of the Karun, tie island of Umm-ul-Khasif and Shamshamiyah being upon the Turkish side, and thence •leaves the bank of the river Shatt-al-’Arab in a north-westerly direction towards Hawizeh. The whole province of ’Arabistan is nominally under the Persian Government. The seat of Government is Shushtar, but of late years, the Governor-Generals have spent most of their time at Dizful, owing to their unpopularity at Shushtar, where there is great rivalry between the Shaikh and the Bakhtiaris with regard to predominance. The Shaikh of Muhammareh is almost independent of the Persian Governor-General at Shushtar, and controls all the Arab tribes of ’Arabistan. The districts of Fallahiyeh, Jarrahi, Ma’shur, and Hindiyan are under tribal chieftains, vdio are also responsible to the Shaikh for good government. Ahwaz is managed through a Deputy Governor with head quarters at Bandar Nasiri. He only acts under the Shaikh’s orders, and has but little power. Muhammareh is managed through the Naib-ul-Hukumah, who is practically the head of the police. In most matters,however,i the government of the Shaikh is personal and extremely stringent. Apart from the towns, the chief factors in administration and politics seem to be the different tribal divisions. (1) The Al Kathir, with the Sagwand, administer the coun try west, south-west and north-west of Dizful. They are ruled by two chiefs, both of whom are recognised by the Persian Government. The control of the country and the tribesmen and the collection of revenues is left entirely in their hands. (2) The Sagvavd move about from place to place in Luris- tan. They pay an annual tribute to the Shah, and their relations with the Faili Lurs appear to be good; but they are under no control except that of their chiefs which is not very close. (8) The Dirahvand of Luristan have a wholesome respect for the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh, and scoff at the sover eignty of the Shah. (4) The Kuhgalus are for the most part nominally under the Governor of Behbehan, who is under the Bakhtiari Ilkhani. Each division has its own chiefs who are re sponsible for the annual tribute. So long as they pay tribute and live peaceably, their internal government is not interfered with; but they are usually in revolt against any authority trying to collect revenue. i.5) The Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh or Faili Lurs. —The Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh is the hereditary ruler and representa tive of the Persian Government. Amongst his sub jects he is the supreme power on earth. Between him and his people intervene two classes of agents. (a) His administrators, amongst whom are a few cf his relations, to whom he entrusts the control of districts and tribes. (b) The Kadkhudas or headmen of tribal sections. &gt;•(6) The Dakhtiqris. —The two chief families are the Ilkhani and the Haji Ilkhani. Neither party can carry on the administration single-handed and the custom ap proved of both by the Bakhtiaris and the Persian Government, is to appoint the Ilkhani from one110 family and the Ilbegi from the other. Their noto rious jealousies and want of unanimity are detri mental to the efficiency of their administration, as discord causes the personal allegiance of their subjects to be unreliable. Such discord affords op portunities for interference by the Pers’an Govern ment, and for hostile intrigue from outside. There is a British Consul at Muhammareh, and a Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, who deals with the Bakhtiaris, and moves to Isfahan in the summer. The hereditary Shaikh of Muhammareh is a personage of some importance, as he is the ruler over the whole of the southern portion of the Persian province of ’Arabistan, and, though nominally subject to the Government of Tehran, he is in great measure independent of the Persian Central authority. Thus, although he pays a certain tribute in return for the freedom of administrative rights, and while there is a Persian customs official at Muhammareh, the latter is only there by agreement with the Shaikh. As regards relations with Persia, in addition to the customs officials at Muhammareh, Ma’shur, and Hindiyan, there are Persian post and telegraph offices; there is a Persian Foreign Office representative at Muhammareh. There is a British post office attached to the Consulate. Eastern shores of the Gulf. The whole of the eastern shores of the Gulf are Persian terri tory. Around Muhammareh and down to the shores of the Gulf proper, is the locality known as Southern ’Arabistan; continu ing south to the Gulf of ’Oman are what are known as the Persian Coast Districts, the last of which adjoins Persian Makran lying on the Gulf of ’Oman and outside the Persian Gulf. The coast “ districts ” of the Persian Gulf proper contain the ports of Bushire, Lingeh and Bandar ’Abbas the only places where the administration is carried out by Persian officials under direct control of the Central Persian Government. In the other localities, the government is farmed out in different degrees to local or other chiefs. The British Indian Government maintains at Bushire a Resi dent, who is known as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Heir noto- Me detti- Won, as of their fords op- n Govern- ice-Consul o. nage of southern though in great j.

At Bushire, Muhammareh and Bandar ’Abbas there are British post offices with a hospital at the former place and all quarantine arrangements under British supervision. Practically all the trade at Bushire, Lingeh, and Bandar ’Abbas is British though several other Powers are represented by Consular agents at some of these ports. For Kuwait see page 48. For measures, weights and currency see Appendix D, page 285.( 312 ) CHAPTER VIII. COMMUNICATIONS. The principal means of communication between the Persian Gulf and Baghdad, through Basrah, is the Tigris, including the Shatt-al-’Arab. All available information will be found under the various routes, see pages 121—122, etc. The Euphrates is navigable to a certain extent, but is not generally used for purposes of traffic, and in its present condi tion it is not suitable for military movement of troops except in a subsidiary sense. Existing information relating to the road communications is imperfect, and requires to be supple mented very considerably, but a main connection with Basrah is to be found through Hillah, Diwaniyah, Samawah, Suq-ash- Shuyukh and along the desert edge; this is probably suitable for wheeled traffic the whole way, but in any case carts can go from Baghdad to Hillah, and from Nasiriyah to Basrah. Carriages pass across the desert from Baghdad to Karbala and Najaf, and it is probable that the previously mentioned road can also be reached fairly easily at Samawah from Najaf. Across the Persian border there are caravan routes from ’Amarah, Kut-al-Amarah, and Baghdad. To Basrah there are caravan routes from Zubair, Umm Qasr and Kuwait, as well as further westwards into Arabia, and the country generally is open and passable for carts. Wheeled transport is little employed in the whole of Meso potamia, camels being principally used, with donkeys for short journeys, and mules in the hilly country to the east. From Baghdad the most important northern route leads to Musal through Kifri, Kirkuk and Arbil, across fertile and well-watered country, and is passable for wheels throughout, the crossing of numerous irrigation canals for the first two stages out of Baghdad, and the ferry over the Great Zab, being the chief difficulties. A track leads over the plain and along the right bank of the river to Musal, but for some stages north of Tikrit it is not passable for wheels, and water is scarce as the river bank cannot there be approached.113 the Persian eluding tie &gt;und under but is not ent condi- &gt;ps except g to tie oe supple- b Basrah Suq-ash- 1 smtable carts can to Basrah, arbala and med road af. jutes from ir, Umm ) Arabia, ts. ; of Meso- s for short oute leads irtile and hroughout, first two Zab, being it bank of ’ikrit it in riyer bank Few supplies are obtainable, except from Bedouins. An easy track, with khans at intervals, leads from Baghdad along the left bank to Samarra, a Persian place of pilgrimage. There is an important route to the north-east leading into Persia by Khaniqin and the Tak-i-Girreh pass up to Kirman- shah. , There is a well-used caravan route from ’Amarah and Kut- al-Amarah, generally following the left bank of the Tigris, and crossing the Diyalah by a bridge of boats near its junction with main stream. An important route, along which a rough kind of diligence plies, leads from Baghdad to the celebrated shrines of Karbala and Najaf, and another to Hillah and Diwa- niyah. From Baghdad westward along the Euphrates to Damascus- and Aleppo the route crosses the plain towards a bridge at Fallujah over the Euphi'ates. For river navigation see Chapter VI. Page 95, et seq. For details of Routes see end of this chanter. Pages 121— 122 . ’Arabistcm. The principal means of communication is by the Karun river. Troops moving up the Karun by land from Muhammareh would follow the right bank until the marshes on the left bank' in the Muhammmareh district were left behind. The tracks to Fallahiyeh are practicabie for transport animals. Karun Kiver .—The largest river of Persia and the only one navigable by steamers. It has its rise in the mountains of the Bakhtiyari country about 100 miles due west of Isfahan and enters the plains of ’Arabistan some 15‘ or 20 miles north of Shushtar Town. The name Karun appears to have been unknown to the Arab and Persian geographers of the middle ages, who called the river the Dujail, adding the epithet ‘‘ of Ahwaz ” or “ of Shushtar” to distinguish it from the Pii]ail canal near Baghdad. Upper course .—Not far below its exit from the hills, which takes place by a defile 3 miles in length known as Tang-i-Qal’eb- i-Dukhtaran, the Karun passes the village of Gotwand on its right bank, here there is, upon that side, a fertile alluvial plain sloping down slightly from the west, and opposite to it' the fertile plain of ’Aqili round which the river flows in a remark able curve. At 4 miles below Gotwand the Karun leaves the village of Jallakan on its right bank, the plain of ’Aqili being still upon its left, and S miles further down it breaks uhrough a range of pinkish sandstone hills, which rise on the right bank to a height of only 200 or 300 feet, but on the left bank attain an elevation of about 1 , 000 ; the portion of the range nearest to the river upon its eastern bank is Kuh-i-Fidalak. Two and a half miles beyond the Kuh-i-Fidalak barrier and at about half a mile from the town of Shush tar, the river which has since emerging from the hills preserved a generally north and south direction swings to the westwards. About 600 yards above the town it divides into two streams, the Gargar to the east and the Karun proper to the west. On the north side of the town the Karun proper forms a broad sheet of water, and then, turning to the south and passing an ancient dam and a bridge known as the Pul-i-Dizful, it changes its 'name to Shatait. At a point 30 miles south in a direct line from the town of Shushtar the Gargar rejoins the Shatait the village of Band- i-Qir standing between them in the angle above their confluence —and the Karun river once more resumes its course under its own name. At the point of junction of the Gargar and Shatait, the Diz river, coming from the west, adds its waters to the Karun; and from this place to Wais, 12 miles further dowm upon the left bank, the course of the river is straight and almost due southwards. From Wais to Ahwaz Village on the left bank, the direction of the river is on the average south-west; but it winds considerably, and the distance, which is only about 14 miles as the crow flies, is fully doubled in travel ling by water. Rapids of Ahwaz .—Immediately above Ahwaz Village the Karun divides into two streams, enclosing the small island of , Umm-an-Nakhl : it reunites to pass through a gap in the ridge of sandstone hills which here traverse the country at right angles to its course; and in its descent over the sill of rock here forming its bed it giVes rise to the famous rapids of Ahwaz,* by Arabs called Sidd and by Persian Band, which are situated opposite the village so named. The rapids, which are not * A plan of Ahwaz rapids by H. S.

Lower course .—From Nasiri to the tomb of ’Ali-ibn-al- Husain a place on the left bank about 40 miles south-south west of Nasiri in a straight line, the Karun describes an extra ordinary series of bends and convolutions; but at ’Ali-ibn-al- Husain it resumes a more straightforward and ordinary course, eventually reaching the Shatt-al-’Arab at a point situated 25 to 30 miles in a direct line to the south-west of ’Ali-ibn-al- Husain. About 15 miles below ’Ali-ibn-al-Husain it throws off the Salmaniyah or Salmanah canal, now almost dry, from its left bank; and 3 miles further down, opposite the island of Dair, there is an outlet from the left bank of the Karun, called Marid-al-A’ma, or the Blind Marid, which runs inland as a creek for about a mile and forms the mouth of the Fallahiyeh-Marid canal which is supplied with water by the Jarrahi River; on the south-west bank of this creek at three-quarters of a mile from the entrance are some heaps marking the site of the old village of Marid. A dry hollow, containing bushes at the end towards the Karun, connects the Blind Marid with the Qanaqeh branch of Khor Musa; at one time, no doubt the Karun dis- # charged a part of its waters by this route to the sea. On the right bank, opposite to the Marid creek, is the site of the old Ka’ab settlement of Sablah. About 7 miles below the Marid creek and 2 or 3 miles short of the Shatt-al-’Arab, the so-called Bahmanshir quits the Karun on the left bank and follows an independent course to the Persian Gulf. The short remaining reach of the Karun below the head of the Bahmanshir is called by Europeans the “ Haffar ” and by some natives the Bahman shir : the town of Muhammareh stands about the middle of its right bank.* ^ Animal Life. —Duck, teal, snipe, pelicans, and gulls are seen upon the river; the banks hold francolin, hares, lynxes, and wild boars. In warm weather sharks travel up-stream to Nasiri and even to Shush tar Town. Navigability and character of banks .—From Band-i-Qir to Ahwaz village the width of the Karun is about 300 yards and ♦Tradition has it that this reach was artificially dug as an irrigation canal. Some authorities believe that the Shatt-al-’Arab once flowed into the Karun by this channel, instead of vice vena as at present, and that the mingled waters of both rivers were discharged by the channel which we have called the Bahmanshir.116 •there are ordinarily no serious obstacles to navigation; but sandbanks and heaps of stone occur, and the depth of water is sometimes insufficient. The banks here vary in height from 10 to 30 feet and have gravelly plains, behind them towards Ahwaz they are of marl : the brushwood which once clothed them has mostly disappeared. The rapids of Ahwaz, though passable by towing, are a veiy serious obstacle even to native boats, especially with a very high or a very low river,* and bulk is commonly broken at this point, goods for up-country being conveyed by a light railway, of which the trucks are at present drawn by horses, from Nasiri on the lower river to a place a quarter of a mile above Ahwaz village upon the upper. The length of the rapids is about 2,000 yards, they are reckoned to be five in number and the real obstacle to navigation is the second rapid from the top. At this place a reef runs out from the left bank leaving between its point and the right bank a channel, only 100 yards wide; through which the water rushes with a fall of 1 in 50 : this channel is moreover broken up by rocky islets into two or three passages, of which the one adjoining the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yards. Both reef and islets carry masonry remains, those of a great irrigation barrage which here raised the surface of the river, to the level of the surrounding country.! Above the rapids the river is 400 yards broad, between them in places as much as 700, and below them only 200 to 300; from head to tail the total loss of level is 1 foot with a .high river and 7 or 8 feet with a low one. From Ahwaz to Muhammareh, a distance of over 100 miles by river, the Karun averages a quarter of a mile in width and flows through an open uncultivated country. The banks are generally low upon this part its course, and in winter they are occupied by Arab encampments around which some slight and shifting cultivation takes place; but in summer, with the exception of the permanent villages mentioned below,'they are totally deserted. The worst reach for steamers is the 20 miles immediately below Nasiri; vessels of only 3|- feet draft some times have difficulty in navigating it during the low season and are even obliged to unload part of their cargo. * The steamer “ Assyria ” ascended the rapids successfully in 18i2 and the •steamer “ Shushan ” in 1890. t This barrage was called the Shadhurwan, and it existed in the 10th century A. D. (vide Le Strange).Date groves commence on the right bank of the Karun at Qisbeh, 7 miles above Muhammareh Town; and in the final section between the Bahmanshir and the Shatt-al-’Arab botfi. banks carry fine plantations. Above Qisbeh as far as Band-i- Qir the banks are bare and desolate and devoid of wooding. There are ferries on the river at various places noted in the- table below; no bridges, however, exist except the Pul-i-Bulaiti and the Pul-i-Dizful, the latter broken, both at Shushtar. Volume, current, and variations of stream. —The minimum discharge of the Karun has been calculated at 10,000 cubic feet a second, and the flood discharge at 120,000 to 140,000. The average slope of the river below the Ahwaz. rapids is about 5 inches in the mile; and the current varies from 4 to 5' knots in the season of floods to 2 knots between August and November. The Karun, along with its affluents, is liable to more violent and irregular changes of level than the great rivers of Turkish ’Iraq. In most places the difierence between low and high- river is ordinarily from 12 to 14 feet; but there is a difference of 24 feet between the lowest recorded reading in October 1901 and the highest in February 1903. The river is generally at its minimum from the middle of October to the end of Novem ber; and the highest floods usually occur in March and April,*' but sometimes earlier. The influence of the sea tides is per ceptible as far up the river as Ismaiti-yeh and lower down - they cause a rise and fall of 4 to 5 feet; but no salt water ever enters the Karun. Irrigation. —-The Karun is not at present utilised for irriga tion except on a petty scale, and that principally^ by means of water lifts upon the banks which are worked by animals. When the river is full it carries a brown silt and in its lower course runs flush with the banks; its water is at all times more or less- discoloured. The silt does not, it is believed, ever exceed 0 f volume and its fertilising value appears to be low. Districts and villages. —Above Band-i-Qir the course of the Karun in ’Arabistan lies in the Shushtar District; the river then enters the Ahwaz District, which it traverses. The next and last district upon the Karun is that of Muhammareh which; * These data depend on records kept by the river steamers.begins on the right bank immediately above Sab’eh, and on the left bank just above the ruined tombs at ’Ali-ibn-al-Husain. Other communications .—The Diz is navigable by country boats for some little distance above its junction with the Karun, but even in the flood season 1916 boats failed to get within 25 miles of Shush. There are no made roads in the plains but certain more or less defined tracks lead from one centre to another, the desert is everywhere passable for all arms except immediately after heavy rains and near the Shatt-al-’Arab in the flood season. Motors can run on the left bank from Marid to Shuster if the bridge at Band-i-Qir is kept up. On the right bank from Sabeh (half way from Muhammareh to Ahwaz) to Ahwaz presents no difficulties but between Sabeh and BaSrah there is sand and soft going which stops them. Lorries are working between Ahwaz and Shush satisfac torily. The rivers except the Gargar at Band-i-Qir are not bridged. The Karun is not fordable south of Shuster but there are fords over the Diz and Kharkeh except in the flood season when the only means of crossing them is on goatskin rafts (Killicks). The Lynch road runs from Wais to Isfahan, it is, however, a hill track only fit for pack animals through the Bakhtiari Hills. The following shows roughly the time required to get troops from Basrah to Ahwaz to the oil-fields or to Dizful Basrah to Ahwaz by river steamer towing barges ... 2 days. Basrah to Ahwaz by road . . V ,, Ahwaz to oil-fields by road . . 5 ’’ Ahwaz to Dizful by road via Shush . 5 ” There are two roads from Ahwaz to the oil-fields— ( 1 ) Ftd Band-i-Qir and Dar-i-Kazina (distance 82 miles). Along which carts can work the whole way but the river is not bridged nor is it fordable at Dar-i- Kazma, a flying bridge, could, however, easily be made. J 2 ( 2 ) Vid Mula Thanie and Abgungi.Carts can get to Abgungi but in the last 12 miles there are* a number of nullahs which would delay wheeled transport, considerably. From Abgungi is a good pack animal track; this route is about 13 miles shorter than the other, but at Mula Thanie (24 miles from Ahwaz) the road leaves the river; there ■ is consequently difficulty about water. Water from Abgungi is obtained from the nearest point of the river 6 miles off. When the A. P. O. Co. Sternwheeler “ Aminiyeh.” is above the rapids with barges she can tow two 80-ton barges to Dar-i- Ivazina in 24 hours. The road to Khushk opposite Dizful is plain sailing except for an occasional day or two in the flood season when the Shaur becomes impassable. Baghdad Railway. The Baghdad railway has been completed from Haidar Pasha to Ras-al-Ain with the exception of breaks where the. line pierces the Taurus and Amanus Mountains. From the direction of Baghdad the line has been completed as far as, Samarrah. Tramways, Baghdad .—An electric tramway line has been projected, but not commenced (1911), to the suburb of Mu’adh- dham on the north, and to that of Qararah on the south. A horse tramway, 4 miles in length, runs to Kadhimain, another suburb to the' north, on the right bank of the river. This place and Mu’adhdham on the left bank are connected by a boat bridge. Fallujah is now connected with Baghdad by a dicau- ville railway. Other railways .—A railway has been constructed from Shaik. Sa’ad to Es-Sinn. Railways have also been constructed from Basrah to Nasiriyah and from Qurnah to ’Amarah. Telegraphs. The Indo-European Telegraph Department’s cable (British) from India, via Bushire, is landed at Fao, where there was a combined Anglo-Turkish telegraph office, British operators being in charge of the cable terminus. This is now alt British. There is a British telegraph office at Basrah and this line is - now connected across the river with Muhammareh'.BRBBMHMMBHBHMi BHOMnai mmmm 120 A Turkish land line, along the right (western) bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab, went from Fao to Basrah, and thence along the bank of the river Tigris to Baghdad. Another line, branching off at Qurnah, followed the Euphrates Valley, via Hillah, to Baghdad. From Baghdad the land line continued, via Musal, to Constantinople. Telegraphic communication has been established between Basrah, Nasiriyah, Shaikh Sa’ad and Kuwait. The Telegraph Line from Dizful to Shush was completed on 18th June, 1916 and a telegraph office was opened at tfie latter place. This establishes direct communication with Ahwaz. A line with two wires runs from Baghdad north to Musal, and from Baghdad to Kirmanshah and Tehran a line follows the main route through Ba’qubah, Khanaqin and Karind, having two wires on wooden poles. The office in Baghdad is a tumble-down building, and the instruments are badly kept and of inferior workmanship. The condition of the telegraph lines is bad, and a slight atmospheric disturbance causes interruption of service. During the winter it is not uncommon for Baghdad to be cut off from all communi cation with the rest of the world for several days at a time. A Persian Government land line goes from Muhammareh to Ahwaz, and from Ahwaz, via Behbehan and Burazjun, to Bushire. The repair and working of this line was handed over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department in 1914. Wireless.

The shortest of the land routes running between Kuwait and Basrah does not follow the one here described but leads from the Mutla’ Pass direct to Safwan and thereby saves about 5 miles. When the Euphrates rises to any great extent that portion of the route lying between Rafidhiyah, stage 5, and Basrah, is impassable, being sometimes flooded to a depth of 2 or 3 feet. The highest flood season of the Euphrates is during the month of April. Water .—Limited and only passably good at Kuwait, plentiful at stage 1; limited at 3, plentiful at 4, good and abundant at 5 and 6 . It will be noted that there is no water at all between Jahrah, stage 1, and Qashanlyah, stage 4, a distance of 47 miles. Water would therefore have to be stored at the two intermediate halting places, which are optional. Fuel .—Scarce throughout, except at Jahrah, stage 1, and near Rafidhiyah, stage 5.

W^ter would probably have to be carried. N.-W. to mile 3, to gap in the belt of low hills which are known as the Jalaz-Zor. This gap is called the Mutla’ Pass, being named from a hill 415 feet high on the east side of it. The hill on the west side is called Mutaill’ah. Through this gap a small valley discharges its drainage into the Jahrak plain; it is called Jauf-al-Mutla’ and has its head near mile 5. A few miles to the west of the Jauf are some hills forming a land-mark known as Khashm-al-’Ifri. After traversing the pass, and reaching the plateau, the remainder of the route is passable to all vehicles. The route now turns north by east, and runs in a straight line through the tracts of Zaqlah, Qira’al Marru and Yah, the going is level but stony. At mile 23, the route enters the Batih district, an undulating, perfectly waterless desert, lying somewhat high, its elevation varying from 130 to 210 feet. At mile 26, pass 2 mounds known as Hissu-adh-Dhabi. At mile 29, the low-lying tract called Radhatain falls away to the east. The route then crosses over numerous slight ridges, the southerly being known as A1 Abatah, and the northerly being known as Hamar, and passes through the locality of Batih- al-’Aud. About mile 42, the broad, shallow depression of Sil Jirfan is traversed. The Qash’aniyah wells are 6 in number, and contain good water at 18 feet. About 5£ miles to the east-south-east are the hill and the sweet-water wells of Umm Niqqah.126 Route No. 1— contd . 4 SAFWAN . . . 10.—About N.-E. over slightly undulating, 77 stony desert. Safwan, a village situated on slightly rising ground, just within the Turkish Frontier, and consisting of 2 or 3 small enclosures containing a few houses and a date grove, surrounded by a wall, and belonging to the Naqib of Basrah. Lucerne and a few sheep are the only supplies obtainable. To the east of the date grove is a post garrisoned by 10 zaptiahs (1911). One mile to the west is a Bedouin halting place with wells of fair water at 12 feet. Jabal Sanam stands 5 miles west of the village. 5 RAFIDHIYAH . . 14.—General direction, slightly E. of N. 91 The route runs over flat barren, stony ground, passable for all arms. It skirts the swamps at the head of Khor Zubair, and is above the ordinary flood level. At mile 14, Rafidiyah, a country residence of the Naqib of Basrah, it is a quadrangular enclosure with bastions at the north and south angles. Water sufficient for 1 brigade in ■standing camp from 5 wells of which 3 contain undrinkable and 2 drinkable water. There are a few trees. 6 BASRAH . . . 16.—General direction N.-E. by E. The 107 route at first runs north over a plain with a very slight ascent. The soil is gravel ly. There is fair camel-grazing and occasional houses with irrigated gardens. The whole of the country betw r een Rafi- dhlyah and mile 6 is plentifully supplied with water from wells 5 to 6 feet deep; they are especially numerous about mile 4. From mile 3 to 6 there is scattered cultivation of rice, maize, lucerne, and dates, the pots being surrounded by tamarisk growth. This tract is called Dirhamlyah, and the population is about 6,000. There are large numbers of buffa loes, cows, and sheep. At mile 8 , site of old Basrah, and 3 miles off the track in a direction south-west by west, is Zubair, a well-built town situated on slightly elevated ground with a ridge of brokenRoute No. 1— concld. ground to the north-west, north, and north-east. Small quantities of supplies, a bazar, no fodder, 4 or 5 wells of good water. In the time of the Euphrates flood a water channel, which approaches the northern end of the town of Zubair, from the direction of Basrah, contains 2 feet of water. The route turns north-east. It then crosses an open barren plain. The soil is light brown, hard, and dusty; it is free from stones. From mile 6 to mile 10 the route runs in a depression which is liable to be submerged by the Euphrates in high water season, to a depth of 2 to 3 feet. At mile 11 the date groves and gardens of Basrah commence. At mile 12, the road enters the town across a small bridge, after which it passes under a built-over tunnel of houses, known as the Bab-al-Kuwait. Thence it emerges into the bazars. The route for wheeled traffic goes through the city and bazar to reach the landing places on the river Shatt-al-’Arab. Animals can make their way through by various paths, as the irrigation channels are bridged for foot-passengers only. Between Zubair and Basrah there is a good, open road, but it is unmetalled.

Vessels of 25 feet draught and 450 feet length can navigate the Khor Zubair as far as Umm Qasr fort. About 4 miles south of the fort the Khor makes a .sharp bend to* the east. Landing is difficult here, as at low water there is a bank of soft mud and sand stretching 400-500 yards from the shore. The best landing place is found about 1 mile north of the bend. Here the slope of the bank is an even 1 - 20 , and at high tide, shallow native craft or barges could come close into the shore, which has a firm surface extending back to the higher ground, about 1 mile west of the Khor, on which the road runs. The tide ebbs very rapidly, sometimes as much as four feet in one hour, and when it is low.there is about 6 inches of soft mud and sand on the slope of the bank, on which native craft or barges could lie. Further north of this landing place a strip of soft ground intervenes between the Khor and the higher ground on which the road runs.

It is excellent going in dry weather throughout its whole length. From near the fort at Fao, to Ma’amrah, a new dam has been made to keep out the salt water. Horses can go along the top of this embankment, but wdieeled transport would have to keep to the w’-est side of it on desert soil, and this is generally bad going for wffieels, as it is at this point a salt mud flat which never dries, and is flooded at' high tides. This condition, however, ceases above Shaikh Naghaimish s village in Ma’amrah, 7 miles up stream from Fao Telegraph Office. At Durah, stage 1, and Saihan, stage 2, the date groves narrow down to a few yards, or are non-existent. The river is deep in both places, and ships with supplies can be brought close into the bank. Water.—Each village stands on a creek, generally providing good and plentiful water. There are no wells, but water is always easy to obtain from creeks or the river. The banks would generally require to be ramped to enable animals toRoute No. 3— contd. get to the water’s edge, but this would present no difficulty. Near the sea, water should be taken with the falling tide, especially when the river is low. Fuel .—A great abundance of date-palm wood. Fodder .—Plenty of short grass insid^ the date plantations. Lucerne and barley are extensively grown and, in places, rice. Outside the date plantations there is no grazing, except in spring for sheep. Supplies.—Large quantities of dates, and a little straw and barley, are obtainable at the hamlets. The best dates are procurable at Durah and Saniyah, stage 1, the former tract also producing a few grapes, oranges, and figs. Meat is generally abundant, and milk, fairly so. A few donkeys and indifferent horses are to be found in many of the hamlets most of which also possess boats. A considerable number of boats and barges could easily be collected!

The administrative head quarters of a district of the same name extending along the right bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab from the sea upwards for 8 miles; a place of international importance. Fao station consits of two sets of telegraph offices, one Turkish and the other British : and a fort situated nearly 4 miles below the station. The Turkish telegraph quarters are built of stone, and were completed in 1913. Still further from the river are the British quarters, where there is water stored in 7 tanks, each holding 400 gallons. South of the British compound is the Sarai, or Turkish Government building, a substantial single-storeyed brick structure of o rooms; and near by is a village of huts with a population of 150 souls. Fao fort is about 500 yards from the Shatt-al-’Arab, but at high tide the water washes up to its walls. It is roughly rectangular, and is out of repair. Its main face looks towards the mouth of the river and rises about 15 feet above the glacis. It is faced with a light coloured stone. Fao fort is now almost completely shut134 Route No. 3— contd . in by date groves. Supplies comprise dates, and very small quantities of wheat, barley, lucerne, and vegetables; also a few cattle, and a very few sheep. (See also page 18.) 1 DAWAIB . . . 26.—General direction N.N.W. The road 26 strikes away from the river through date groves to the desert; from near the fort, 4 miles below the telegraph station, to Ma’amrah, about 6 miles above it, an embankment has recently been constructed to keep out the salt water at high-tide. Horses and men can move along the top of it, but not waggons (see above). From Ma’amrah onwards the track is over dry hard desert (except in wet weather, when it is very boggy, and after high tide in spring when the river is in flood) and runs just behind the date groves and close to the telegraph line. Hamlets are met with every half mile or so in the date groves. At mile 7, village of Shaikh Naghamish. At mile 10 , village of Mukhrag. A few creeks run about a mile into the desert, but they can easily be circumvented. At mile 18 Durah; also known as Salih Bin Ibrahim; milk, and a few sheep and chickens.

QURNAH . . . 46.—From the sea to the junction of the Euph rates and the Tigris at Gurmat ’Ali at mile 5|, the river is called the Shatt-al-’Arab. Above Basrah the banks are low and fringed with date plantations. A few villages, clusters of mud huts, are scattered among the trees, and herds of cattle, sheep, and buffaloes graze° along the banks. Much rice is grown between Basrah and Qurnah. Qurnah is a place of 700 houses on the west bank of the Tigris, on the actual promontory at the old junction with the Euphrates. There are a few 2 -storeyed brick houses on the bank, with gardens and date plantations. It was the seat of a Qaim- Maqam under Basrah. The date plantations extend some 4 miles above Qurnah, but after that only a few solitary clusters are to be seen until near Baghdad. Above Qurnah begin the great marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates which extend between the rivers, and as far as Hawizeh to the east. In spring the country is under water, with little visible but tall reeds and sedges. The marshes to the east are formed by the overflow of the Karkheh, Tib, and Dawairij rivers from the Pusht-i-Kuh mountains. One outlet called by Europeans the Hadd, but known locally as the Jahalah (always pronounced Chahalah), runs out of the Tigris just above ’Amarah. Another, the Swaib, the main outlet of the Karkheh, enters the Shatt-al- ’Arab 6 miles below Qurnah. 75 AL ’AZAIR (EZRA’S 29.—Pass A1 ’Azair TOMB). (Ezra’s Tomb), a group of buildings on the west bank, an important place of pilgrimage for Jews. Above this the river flows in a winding channel through theRoute No. 4— contd. Narrows with several sharp turns demanding careful navigation. The channel is deep with mud banks fairly firm. 87 AKS-ASH-SHAI-TAN 12.—This most difficult OR THE DEVIL’S turn is called by ELBOW. Europeans the Devil’s Elbow; also requiring careful navigation. ... QASR SA’IDAH . . The Muntafik and the A1 Bu Muhammad Arabs cultivate some ground near Qasr Sa’idah. They live mostly in reed huts, and use long, narrow boats. Pass Qasr Sa’idah, a small mud fort. 103 QAL’AT SALIH . . 16.—Pass Qal’at Salih or Shatrah, formerly the seat of a Qaim- Maqam, on the east bank, 500 houses some of Sabians. It is the centre of a qadha under Basrah, and steamers only stop when they have cargo. In QaTat Salih are a few gardens of fruit and date trees; high mud walls. The river gradually widens above this, having a belt of wheat and rice cultivation on both banks. At mile 12 above Qal’at Salih the banks get slightly higher. Barley, wheat, maize, millet, sesame, and ricp are the chief products. ABU SAIJAN . . The wheat and barley extend in a strip along both banks. In spring and early summer abundance of good grass along the banks. Pass Abu Saijan, a small grove of trees on the west bank, with a ziarat. 132 ’AMARAH . . . 29.—’Amarah is on the east bank, and contains 1,500 houses, with a small, well supplied bazar. The population are settled Arabs, with some Persians and Sabians, 20 houses of Christians, and 50 of Jews. The Moslems are chiefly Shi’ahs. The houses are of sun-dried bricks and mud, with some of burnt bricks. A branch of the Tigris, the Chahalah, flows out immediately above the town. It was the centre of a sanjaq, and had a barrack for139 'at Sal i formerly 1 a Qaii- abians.

It was a regular stopping-place for steamers; they came alongside the wharf, which is faced with brick and is about + a mile long. There is a bridge of boats, of 23 light wooden pontoons, covered with bitumen, each 25 feet long and 10 feet broad, with a free board of 6 feet. The waterway is 12 feet, and the road way 20 feet wide, of wood, with fascines covered with clay. ’Amarah is a thriving place, exporting wheat and barley from the country along the Chahalah (Hadd) channel. Between ’Amarah and Dizful, in Persia, there is a certain caravan traffic. Along both banks there are a few date plantations and gardens. At mile 15 above ’Amarah cultivation ceases.' At ’Amarah the river is 250 yards wide, and up stream becomes wider, less water losing itself in the marshes. (See page 98.) 174 ’ ALI-ASH-SH ARQI . 42.—Pass ’Ali-ash-Sharqi, a small shrine on the east bank in a grove of trees. 188 FILAIFILAH . . 14.—Two hours higher up on the east bank is Filaifilah; 50 Arab mud huts with small gardens and a few date trees. 211 ’ALI-AL-GHARBI 23. The river is 300 to 350 yards wide, and the banks slightly increase in height. At ’Ali-al-Gharbi the river makes a wide eastern bend, and approaches to within 30 miles of the Pusht- i-Kuh range, on the Persian Frontier. 243 SHAIKH SA’AD . . 32.—Situated on a small area of ground which is above high flood level. 285 KUT-AL-AMARAH . 74.—Kut-al-Amarah is 285 miles from Basrah following the winding of the river, and 214 miles from Baghdad. A caravan route leads from here through Jasan and Badrah to Mandali, and forms the outlet for the trade of those districts. A difficult hill track leads by Zurbatieh and Deh Bala to Kirmanshah.140 Route No. 4— contd . A caravan route lies across the desert to Baghdad, following the general direction of the Tigris, and crossing the Diyalah at the boat bridge, at its junction with the Tigris. Occasional caravans come from Shushtar and Dizful along the foot of the Pusht-i-Kuh; but the Bani Lam Arabs have made this route insecure. The northern entrance of the Gharaf or Shatt-al-Hai stream is opposite Kut. It can be navigated by native boats w r hen the water is high in spring. The Tigris at Kut is 400 yards wide, and above it the banks become higher. 331 BAGHAILAH . . 46.—Pass Baghailah, a settlement built in 1885, containing 100 houses on the west bank, and fairly thriving. 387 ’AZIZIYAH . . . 56.—’Aziziyah, 60 houses on the east bank, with a telegraph office. The Government has made spasmodic efforts to settle this fertile country. On the Tigris are Baghailah, Suwairah (or Juwaimisal), ’Aziziyah, and Salman Pak, each having a small mud fort with a few zaptiahs. They are all in a fairly thriving condition, except Salman Pak; but there still remain immense tracts of fertile country, uninhabited except by' a few wandering nomads only requiring irrigation to become fruitful. 407 BAGHDADIYAH . 20.—Enter a wide loop of the. river in which are the ruins of a mud fort called Baghdadiyah, on some low sandy mounds, rising 100 feet above the river which winds very much here. 10.—On the west bank, near the north end of this loop, is Suwairah, SUWAIRAH (OR JAZIRAH, OR JUWAIMISAH) a settlement of 50 houses. A few gardens behind the village and a small mud fort at the north end of the place, 100 yards square with loopholed walls, ■■■141 Kotjte No. 4— contd.

A khan about 1 mile above the village. 467 CTESIPHON (TAQ-I- 50.—Enter a long bend, KISRA) near Ctesiphon, which doubles back almost ■on itself. The Arch of Ctesiphon, or the Taq-i-Kisra, stands in the chord of the bend, overlooking the ruins of Seleucia on the west bank, and Ctesiphon on the east. It is a good landmark, visible 3 hours off- There was a small gunpowder factory on the west bank, which utilised the saltpetre found in the vicinity, but it is now unused. 479 DIYALAH RIVER . 12.—Pass the mouth of the Diyalah. Several small mud villages on both bank's, while the fringe of cultivation on the banks become nearly continuous. There is a boat bridge of 13 pontoons over the Diyalah near the junction of the Baghdad-Kut-al-Amarah route. Below Baghdad, and above the mouth of the Diyalah, is an island with brushwood and trees; the banks are lined with date gardens i to f mile from the bank, beyond which is an extent of cultivated country. Each date garden is surrounded by a high mud wall and irrigated by water-lifts. 498 BAGHDAD . . . 19.—A sharp bend of the river brings Baghdad into view. At Qararah, about 3 miles above the junction of the Diyalah, is a boat bridge of 40 pontoons over the Tigris. Baghdad is the capital of ’Iraq, and is built on both sides of the Tigris; undefended, hut almost surrounded by a raised road, many 3-storeyed houses of brick; 4,000 shops, over 200 khans, and many mosques; population, about 140,000. Water for drinking purposes is obtained either by means of pipes from the Tigris, or, as is generally the case, from carriers. A large number of houses possess wells, but the water in them is not drinkable. Fuel is abundant, and fodder (for cattle,, 142 Route No. 4— concld. donkeys, mules, camels, etc.) is fairly so, that for horses being indifferent. Supplies consist of rice, wheat, barley, and other cereals; also fruit and vegetables. Livestock plentiful; domestic birds in considerable numbers. (See also page 37.) Route No. 5.

General. —The Route is practicable throughout for all arms except during the high flood season (April, May and June). During the greater part of these months, considerable portions of the road, up to Steamer Point in the fourth stage, are liable to be flooded. Pack transport could move over the road, in normal years, up to about the middle of April. Beyond Steamer Point there is an embanked road which is generally above flood level but was under water this flood season (1916). After rain portions of the road become very heavy and difficult for wheeled traffic. The following report refers only to the period of the year during which the road is normally open, i.e., July to March inclusive. Obstacles .—The road crosses 5 bridges, all of which are capable of carrying Field guns. In addition to the above there are a few shallow creeks, the sides of which require ramping for wheeled traffic.Route No. 5— contd. Communications.—There is a telegraph line (two wires, iron tubular posts) running adjacent to the road the whole way. If river transport, other than steamers, is used, the length of the marshes and the positions of camping grounds must depend on the rate at which the boats can move, which with a head wind, is very slow. From Gurmat Ali up to the bend of the river four miles below Nahr Umr, the bank consists of shelving mud for 20 or 30 yards from the water, and dis- embarkation of stores is difficult. For the remainder of the Route, good landing places are easily found. The total dis tance by water from Ashar is 46 miles. Water .—Good and plentiful from the Shatt-al-’Arab, and from creeks flowing from it. The marsh water is generally brackish and undrinkable. Supplies. —Dates, eggs, chicken, sheep, grain, milk, and wild duck can be bought in small quantities from villages en route. There is a certain amount of scrub suitable for cattle grazing and fuel along the west of the road. Camping grounds .—There is unlimited camping space, except during the flood season (March to June inclusive), when the marshes run close along side, or actually flood, the road. As long as the road itself is not closed by floods, sufficient dry camping space can be found for at least one brigade of Infantry. The camping ground at Steamer Point though usually above flood level was under water from May to July 1916.

The starting point is the junction of the Baghdad and ’Ashar roads, about one mile west of Makina Masus. From here the road lies over open desert. On its right is a grove of date palms, which stretches down to the river. At mile | the road crosses an irrigation bund about 10 feet high by an easy gradient, and from here the Margil road branches off N.E. At mile 3 theroad approaches Gurmat 'Ali which stands in the angle between the Shatt-al- ’Arab and the New Euphrates channel. East of Gurmat Ali along the bank of the Shatt-al- Arab there is a line of 12 brick kilns, 15 to 25 feet high. The road crosses the New Euphrates at mile 4 by a bridge formed of tubular pontoons; length of bridge 200 yards. The northern section of the bridge can be swung open to allow boats to pass. Ihe camping ground, consisting of two rectangular sites, one on each side of the road, is reached at mile 4-1, 1 mile beyond the bridge. Between the road and the Shatt-al-’Arab there is a further line of brick kilns, where a large number of bricks are available. Water good and plentiful from the Shatt-al-’Arab. The best landing and watering-place is just south of the line of brick kilns, but the approaches are difficult owing to mud. 2 NAHR UMR . . 121 .—General direction of stage N.W. following 17 the bank of the Shatt- al-’Arab, but keeping to the west of the cultivated area. The road is heavy and difficult for wheeled traffic up to the Miyadiyah canal, but beyond this it lies over desert and is good going. After rain it becomes very heavy. It passes close to a few mat-shed hamlets, but no supplies can be counted on. At mile 11 the Miyadiyah canal is crossed by a trestle bridge, 180 feet long. At mile 2, as the floods rise, the water on the west approaches to within a few yards of the road for about 1 mile, and eventually renders it impassable. At mile 3, reach Limshan mounds, standing about 10 feet above the plain. At mile 51 the road bears N.W. keeping further from the river. East of this point and close to the river there is a high building, affording a good observation station. At mile 8 a long mound r standing 5 feet above the plain, is passed at 1 mile east of road.. At mile 11 the road again approaches the cultivated river belt passes within \ mile of several brick kilns and bears W. by N. to Nahr Umr camping ground. For a distance of about 1 mile up to Nahr Umr the ground is sandy and heavy.

The road is passable by all arms, it lies over a mud plain, which in dry weather is good going, but becomes slippery and heavy after rain. The road crosses a few water cuts, which require ramping for wheeled traffic. For 1 mile after leaving camp the road is heavy and sandy. At mile 2 it crosses a creek, which in flood season has about 2 feet of water in it, and re quires to be I’amped, for the passage of wheeled traffic. From mile 6 to mile 7 , some mounds, standing about 20 feet high, are met with on each side of the road. The tomb of Sufman Bin Daud is passed on the west of the road at a distance of 1 ^ miles and on the east of the road is the village of Dair. As the flood rises (in March) the water approaches to within ^ mile of the mounds on the west of the road, and of the road itself from Dair to Yasseh at mile 10. The 2 telegraph poles which mark the Shafi Canal are visible from Yasseh, immediately north of which are two canal cuts, which require ramping. At Yasseh the road passes between some low mounds, and another is met with west of the road at mile 11 . mile 13, after crossing about A mile of broken ground, the road crosses the Shafi Canal by a boat bridge, 50 yards long. The camp is about J mile north of the bridge,, just beyond 2 brick kilns about 25 feet high. W ater plentiful from Shatt-al-’Arab to which the approaches are easy.

At mile 44 and at mile 54 the road crosses 2 shallow creeks containing a little water in flood sefason. These form no obstacle but the banks (need to be ramped. At mile 5^ the small mat village of Shunainah is passed on the east of the road and about 4 mile from it..msmm 146 Route No. 5— concld. At mile 7 the road crosses by a rail and plank bridge the Obumaili creek, 12 feet broad, containing good water. The road is here within a mile of the marsh, and as the flood rises the approaches to the bridge becomes very bad. From here an embanked road runs along the north bank of the canal to the river at Steamer Point, where there are landing places and a camping area, protected from floods by bunds. From Steamer Point an embanked road, which is passable throughout the flood season, runs N. by W. to the junction of the Shatt-al-’Arab and the Euphrates. During the non-flood season, the track leading direct from the Ghumaili bridge over the desert should be used. The cultivated river belt is entered at mile 11. At mile 12 the Euphrates is crossed by a boat bridge, 120 yards long and Qurnah is reached. The camping ground lies west of a bund about mile from the bank of Tigris, distant 11- miles from the bridge. Water good and plentiful from the Tigris. There are numerous landing places at Qurnah, which is a village of some 700 houses, with gardens and date plantations. There is a telegraph office here. Route No. 6.

The sections between Muzaibilah and Sarifah, where the route crosses marsh and low-lying ground, is impassable for guns except at the driest time of the year; September to January, both in clusive. The remainder of the route could, with improved bridging, be made practicable for all arms during the whole of the dry season. The going is generally very rough. Obstacles .—In addition to the marsh mentioned above, the chief obstacles are the numerous canals and water cuts. Tem porary wooden bridges have, however, been thrown across the larger of these, but these bridges require strengthening for continuous traffic. The approaches to the smaller water cuts have been improved. The Tigris is crossed at Umm Mas-ha near Qal’at Salih by a bridge of boats. Watei \—Good and plentiful from the Tigris and its tributaries. Supplies. —Dates, eggs, chicken, sheep, grain and a little milk and wild duck can be bought at most of the villages en route. Some grazing and fuel can be found alongside the road. Communications .—The route follows the telegraph line (two wires, iron tubular posts) the whole way. If river trans port, other than steamers, be used, the length of the marches depends very largely on the rate at which the boats can move. With a head wind progress is very slow, and it takes roughly 10 hours to do a distance of 16-18 miles by river correspond ing to 12-14 miles by road. The total distance by river is 96 miles. Camping grounds .—In high flood season (March to June) the following localities stand above water :— (a) Qurnah—right bank only. The left bank is subject to inundation. Qurnah itself, including Fort Snipe, would accommodate a division with difficulty. (b) The Abu Aran and adjoining mounds within 10 miles up-stream of Qurnah—-mostly right bank—would, if necessary, accommodate a division. (c) Withijj 2^ miles of Abu Rubah on left bank there is a tomb about 1£ miles from the Tigris. This stands on a mound big enough to hold a brigade. There148 Route No. 6— contd . is another mound close to the river which would also hold a brigade. (cl) From QaL’at Salih to ’Amarah, both inclusive, the country is above high flood level on both banks, and is generally suitable for camping grounds throughout. (e) ’Amarah affords good camping facilities for an un limited number of troops. If camped on right bank, or on left bank up-stream of the Musharrah Canal, the width of dry ground is limited. There are good sites lying between the Musharrah and Jahalah Canals and between the Jahalah Canal and the Tigris (left bank) S.E. of town.

The country to the w r est of the road is thick grass and difficult for all arms. The villages are mostly of reed huts but there are a few mud houses. At mile 3^ a creek, in dry season, 10 yards wide and 4 feet deep with muddy bottom, is crossed by a single trestle bridge with a 9-foot roadw-ay. (In the flood season, the creek is 16 yards wide by 6 feet deep). At mile a creek, empty in dry season, but 10 yards wide and 5 feet deep in the flood season, is crossed. At mile 5 Norfolk Hill, 15 feet high, which forms a good signal station, is passed on the right, and just beyond it, the villages of Jabbah and Tash on the left. At mile 5 the Barbukh creek is crossed by a wooden trestle bridge 20 yards long, ramped with sand bags. The bottom is muddy and the water in dry season 4 feet deep. Passing the villages of ’Aluwah and Jal’ah on the right, the road crosses a small creek ''vilh 2 feet to 4 feet of water by a single trestle bridge at mile 64, and leaving the towers of Abu Aran on the right, reaches a deep and fastRoute No. 6— contd. flowing creek at mile 7, which is crossed by a bridge of 4 trestles, 20 yards long. The creek is, in dry season, 8 feet deep. From here to mile 12, where the Sakrichah creek is reached, the track continues a little to the west of the telegraph line and leaves the village of Maziblah two miles to the east; the low range of sand-hills, skirting the track to the west, and also the old Turkish entrenched position through which it passes, forming o-ood signal stations. The Sakrichah creek is 4 feet to 6 feet deep. It is crossed by a bridge, 20 yards long, made of 6 wooden trestles. The most ‘ suitable camping ground is about i mile beyond the creek. 25 T— road is a sand* track, rough in many places and requires much work to make it at all easy for transport. The country •to the west of the road is almost impassable tor all arms, being marshy and covered with high grass. At mile 1 s ^ e ^ d * hills 15 feet high, which form a good signal station, are passed on the right, and, just beyond, a creek, 15 yards broad, is- crossed by a bridge of two wooden trestles.

At mile 2}, a| and 8 |- the villages of Zabun, Kasarah, and Mantaris are passed on the right, and at mile 9 a small fort, which forms a good signal station. The village of Abu Rubah is passed, also on the right at mile 11 , and from here to the camping ground which is just short of Abu Tamr canal, the going is extremely rough.

After crossing the Sulaiman canal the going is good. On leaving the camp, the Abu Tamr canal, 16 yards wide, is crossed by a 3-trestle bridge with a 10-foot roadway, steep ramp, sandy approach. The track then crosses two deep water cuts, which form a considerable obstacle. At mile 1 the village of Khashim is passed, at mile 3| the Sulaiman canal is crossed by a bridge, and at mile the Saiyid canal (10 yaids wide and 3 feet deep) is crossed by a 3-trestle bridge steep ramp and deep sandy approach.

Venables, I.A.R., February; Captain R. A. Yearsley, 28th P.I., December. The route is practicable throughout by all arms, except-152 Route No. 7— contd . • during the high flood season (April, May and June). During the greater part of these months, considerable portions of the road are flooded, both from inundations from the marshes east of the river and from the river itself. Wheeled transport can in normal years, move over the track up to the end of March, but with considerable difficulty during this latter month. After heavy rain portions of the road become very heavy and prac tically impassable by wheeled transport, until the ground dries. The following report refers only to the period of the year during which the road is normally opepi, i.e., July to March inclusive. Obstacles .—The road crosses numerous shallow’ creeks and canal cuts, the most important of which are noted in the report. During the dry season these are easily crossed by all arms, but require to be ramped for the passage of wheeled traffic. As the river rises, many of them fill with water, and some kind of improvised bridge is necessary to enable wheeled transport to cross them. There are several other less important canal cuts, which present no obstacle. Communications.—A. telegraph line runs along the opposite bank of the Tigris. If river transport, other than steamers is used, the length of the marches and the positions of camping grounds must depend on the rate at which the boats can move, which with a head wind is very slow. Good landing places can be found every few miles. The total distance by water is 72 miles. Water .—Good and plentiful from the Tigris. The marsh water is generally brackish and undrinkable. Supplies. Dates, eggs, chicken, sheep, grain, milk and wild duck can be bought in small quantities from villages en route. There is a small amount of scrub suitable for cattle grazing and fuel along the river bank. ( amping grounds. There is unlimited camping space except during the flood season (March to June inclusive) when the marshes run close alongside, or actually flood, the road.

The road runs over desert, which is, in dry weather, good going for all arms, although there are a few heavy, sandy stretches. Several shallow canal cuts, which require ramping for wheeled traffic, are’met with. Only the most important are mentioned in this report. Starting from the bridge over the Chahalah Canal the track keeps to the north of the camp, and runs N. W. towards the rhffit edge of the most distant visible grove of date palms, which it°reaches at mile 3. Up to mile 1, i.e., until the camping ground is passed, the road is in bad repair and is heavy and dusty. At mile 3 the track reaches the corner of some date palm gardens, with mud walls 10 to 12 feet high. The end of the date gardens at mile 4| is marked by a conspicuous bushy tree standing on the river bank near some mud rums, ike ground is here very rough for about 500 yards. The track passes close alongside the river bank, and then bears W. by b., direct to the next bend in the river, which it meets at mile bj. Opposite to this point, on the right bank of the ligns is a date plantation, with a conspicuous house and tower, called Bustan at Taiyif. Between mile 4£ and mile 64 the open stretch of around in the bend of the river provides good camping and watering facilities. From mile 6-3* the track follows the river hank, crossing several shallow canal cuts. At mile /: £ tnere is a ruined mud tower. The track is here soft and heavy, but it improves before reaching a large square fort with corner towers, qalled Shaikh Shabib, at mile 8 |. Just before reaching i point the track leaves the river and # strikes W. by b about half a mile very heavy going is met with, offering di - culties to wheeled traffic, but further on the track improves considerably, passing through extre^ely^fea^reiess country, until it reaches the river again at mile_ 13|. Here there are few ruined mud houses, and a suitable site for a camping grm can be found. The camping ground is reached 3 mile further154 Route No. T— contd . on, and miles S. of Abad Ali, just beyond a shallow triple canal cut 15 yards wide. Water good and plentiful from Tigris. No grazing nor fuel. As the floods rise, the track from mile 8 ^ to mile 13^, where the river is again met with, becomes impassable, and a line should be taken close alongside the river bank. For the first two miles after leaving Shaikh Shabib’s fort, at mile 8 |, the going is heavy and difficult for carts. It then improves and remains fairly good until the direct track is joined at mile 131-. South of this point, in a loop of the Tigris, there is about 1,000 yards of scrub jungle. This river track crosses numerous canal cuts, and adds about 1 mile to the length of the march. The following are the principal canal cuts met with in this stage :— Distance from Camp in miles.

In dry weather, the road is passable throughout by all arms, but is very heavy in parts, and is generally worse than the first stage. Up to mile 1 the ground is low lying, and is liable to be flooded by spillage from an inundation which forms on the right of the track, and about 500 yards from it155 Route No. 7— contd. as soon as the floods begin to rise. In dry weather the going is good. At mile 1£, opposite the nomad village of Abad Ali, there are a few hundred yards of heavy going. The river here bends away to the west, and is met again at mile 2£. The next half mile is soft and rough, and is very difficult after any rain. At mile 2 £ the . river again bends westwards and is met again at mile 3£. At mile 3 the track passes close to the E. of a small mat village, but better going is found to the W. of it. From mile 3| to mile 6 the track keeps close to the river. At mile it crosses a dry canal cut 12 yards wide and 2 £ feet deep, and at mile 5^ a canal 9 yards wide and 5 feet deep, which in February has about 2 feet of water in it. At mile 6 some ruined mud towers are passed on the left of the track, and a few hundred yards beyond these, a narrow cultivated strip, running E. from the river bank, is crossed. From this point for about 1 mile the road is very soft and sandy. The track continues close alongside the river and from mile 74 to mile 8 ^- several suitable places can be found for watering animals. At mile 8 two canal cuts are crossed, each about 6 yafds wide and 4 feet deep, containing a little water. From here the road runs along the top of a bund, 90 yards long close to the river bank. Beyond the bund for about half a mile the going is soft and heavy. From mile 8 |, Kumait, a conspicuous walled village on the right bank comes into view. The track here leaves the river and runs due North, passing Kumait at a distance of about 1,000 yards. For about 1 mile, when opposite Kumait, the going is over plough, and is extremely heavy and difficult for wheeled transport. Slightly better going is found by keeping close along side the river bank, passing a large ruined mud fort on the left, 1,000 yards south of Kumait; but this route also crosses heavy plough for about half a mile opposite Kumait. At mile 12, Avhere the track again approaches the river, a few hundred yards of heavy ground are met with. From here the going is good up to mile 13J where the camping ground is reached. This is at a sharp salient of the river \\ miles N. of Shaikh Juwi and just beyond a small square mud fort with two round red brick towers. Water good and plentiful from Tigris. No grazing nor fuel. 3 SULAIMAN . . . 13.—General direction of stage N.W. The track 40f lies over open desert.156 Route No. T— contd. sparsely covered with scrub, and is in dry weather, good going, for all arms. No water is found until the next camping ground. After heavy rain or as the floods begin to rise, this track is- impassable, and an alternative track must be taken, following the river bank more closely. The dry weather track leaves the river about half a mile west of camp and strikes NA\. a passing a square 4 -towered mud fort about 600 yards distant on the left. From here the village of Ali Ash Sharqi is visible. Up to mile 7 the going is good over a level grassy plain. From this point Ali Ash Sharqi bears due west, at a distance of about 3 miles. The track still continues good but is dusty, and the ground on either side is uneven with deep ruts and fissures. These are caused by the fact that the country is low lying and remains longer under water during the flood season. From mile 10 till the river is reached at mile 12 ^ the country is covered with scrub, and is intersected fairly frequently by dry irrigation cuts, but the going continues good. Camp is reached at mile 13 at the N. E. corner of the sharp bend in the river f of a mile- E. of Sulaiman. Water good and plentiful from the Tigris. Camel grazing and scrub plentiful. The flood track keeps close alongside the river bank. It passes close to a 4-towered mud fort at mile and a 2-towered mud fort at mile 1^. About 800 yards further on the track keeps just south of a patch of nitre-covered mud. At mile 3 there is about 200 yards of very so|t ground. At mile 4^ the track runs between the river and an inundation, keeping along the river bank, and passing close to a small mat village, opposite which the Dujailah canal takes off from the right bank of the Tigris. In the loop of the river here there is thick scrub jungle. At mile 5 the road runs for 80 yards along a bund between the river and an inundation; the going is very rough. At mile opposite the ruined fort of Husaiyah Salhi, on the right bank of the Tigris, the road runs for 70 yards on a bund along the river bank. From mile 9 better going is found by keeping closer to the river than the track actually runs. The track here enters a mud plain, wdiich extends for about 1 mile and is crossed by numerous shallow water channels. This plain is inundated in flood season, and the river bank must be followed closely. At mile 9-| the village of Ali Ash Sharqi and the tomb of the same name standing in the middle of a conspicuous grove of trees, are passed on the left.

At mile 14 three ruined towers are passed on the left of the track, and £ mile further on another is met with. From here the track runs alongside the river bank over rather soft ground to camp | mile E. of Sulaiman, which it reaches at mile 15.

The 53 track is passable by all arms and is in dry weather, good going throughout, but after rain it becomes soft and heavy. There is plenty of scrub and camel thorn alongside the track, suitable for fuel and camel grazing. As the floods rise the track becomes flooded and a line must be taken keeping close to the river bank. From camp the track winds through scrub and is not easy to follow. For the first | mile it runs in a northerly direction; it then turns N.E. and meets the river at mile 3, near a small mud fort standing on the left bank. At mile 3| the 2-towered mud fort of Azil Ghazban is passed on the opposite bank of the river. Up to here the going is good, but the track crosses a succession of shallow valleys, which become impassable as the floods rise. At mile 4 a dry canal cut, 15' feet wide and l^- feet deep, is crossed. From this point the track leaves the river and runsRoute No. 7— contd. N.N.E. over a plain, covered for a short distance with scrub and later with stubble. From mile 5^- for about 1,000 yards the going is verv rough. From mile 6 the mound of Sarut, bearing N.E? by N'. comes into sight. At mile 7, the stubble covered plain changes to a grassy level, and the going improves. A half a mile further on, the track crosses a dry canal, 40 yards wide and about 5 feet deep, with easy descent and ascent. The same canal is crossed again at mile 9. In dry weather it forms no obstacle, but after rain it should be avoided by keeping more to the w^est. At mile 9 the track passes close beside a mud tower 10 feet high. From mile 10 the track runs due north towards the large ruined fort of Jilaat Husain, which is passed at mile 11. From mile 111 the track runs for nearly a mile on the top of a bund, built across the Hussain creek and along the river bank. Camp is reached on the bank of the Tigris at mile 121. Water good and plentiful from the river. Fuel and camel grazing plentiful. 5 ’ALI GHARBI . . 9.—General direction of stage N. by W. The 62 track runs about 1 mile from the river bank, and, as the floods rise, considerable portions of it are under water. The marginal bunds of the Tigris in several places provide an alternative route, which should be used wdien the regular track is flooded. From camp the track is well defined, and passes over cultivated land, which is in places heavy and rough. At mile 11 a dry, canal cut, 17 feet wide and 2 feet deep is crossed, and 300 yards further on the 4-towered fort of Jilaat .Gharashah is passed on the left. Half a mile further on the going improves. ^ At mile 3 the track crosses about 4 mile of plough. At mile 3| the 3- tow r ered fort and mat village of Umm A1 Hambal is passed on the right bank of the river. About 1,000 yards further on, the marginal bund, 'which has so far followed the bank of the river, comes to an end. At mile 44 the track passes the mat village of Jherriah Sultan, and 800 yards further on the marginal bund begins again. In February, the flood line reaches to within 600 yards of the river. At mile 5? the track leaves the river and strikes due north. The going is good, but the ground is low lying and is liable to early flooding. At mile 7 a shallow depres sion 25 feet wide is crossed and 600 yards further on the trackRoute jSTo. 7— concld . 0 passes the large 3-towered fort of Sila’at Nahr Shams, on the river bank. 200 yards bej^ond the fort there is a dry canal cut, 12 feet wide and feet deep.

Near Shaikh Jaad in the first stage and from Dab uni Reach in the 3rd stage to Lajj in the 6 th stage, the road is par ticularly liable to flooding. In the dry season (September to December inclusive) the going is fairly good throughout, and with slight improvement could be made suitable for motor lorries. Obstacles. —There are several canals and irigation cuts which require ramping for wheeled traffic. None of these require bridging, except where noted in the report.

Supplies .—Limited number of sheep and cattle can be obtained from villages and Arab encampments en route. Communications.—A telegraph line runs roughly parallel and contiguous to the route throughout. If river transport other than steamers be used, the rate of progress is apt to be delayed, as with a head wind progress upstream is very slow; it takes roughly 10 hours to do a distance of 16-18 miles by river, corre sponding to 12-14 miles by road. The total distance by river is 154 miles. Camping grounds .—In time of high flood the only places that can be counted on as having considerable areas above flood level are Kut-al-Amarah, Bagdadie (2£ miles south of Zeur) and Ctesiphon. In high flood a spill is likely from Lajj, which would inundate the country down to Dabuni Reach, in the 3rd stage. The breaching of the Baghdad bunds would flood the whole area down to the Dialah River. In the dry season the space available for camps is unlimited. Details. ELBOW BEND MILES EAST 16 SHAIKH SA’AD. 5* OF 16.—General direction of stage W.N.W. Road runs N.W. from camp ing ground at Kut-al-Amarah for about 2 miles where it joins the old caravan route. For wheeled transport it would require improving by filling in water cuts, etc. Thence to about mile 6 , where road turns S.W. to river, the going is good. The track runs for the greater part of the way along an old canal. Tracks to the river are very sandy and heavy going. From mile 6 to mile 10 the road runs along the river bank (the Zuwair Hamma Reach). There are two tracks. The upper one is dry and dusty, but good going for horses and vehicles. The lower track has in the dry season a hard damp surface, excellent for infantry, but *Route J^o. 8— contd. doubtful, for guns. In the flood season the lower track would probably be flooded. The banks are covered with scrub. Watering is difficult owing to the steep banks. Thence to mile 15, where track again meets river, the road is heavy, boiiu' sandy and easily cut up, with very little improvement in portions noted, the road is perfectly capable of taking motor traffic. Camping ground. —Undefined. Fuel. —Scrub plentiful. Watering .—Easy from river. NAHR KEULAK 19.—General direction of (Elbow bend down- sta^e W.N.W.

Good camping grounds anywhere for next 2 miles. At mile 5 there is a stone bridge over a water-cut which could be made passable bv ramping, if the bridge was destroyed. Remains of Shaikh Ja’ad are passed at mile 5^ on north side of road. There is no village here. No fuel is obtainable. Watering is likely to be difficult owing to steepness of banks. There is a good site for a camping ground on fairly high ground. After crossing the stone bridge the road runs due north for IJ miles towards the ruins of Shaikh Ja’ad. It then turns N.W. and follows line of old canal for 4 ‘ miles. This portion of the road is very good for all arms. About 6 miles from Shaikh Ja’ad the old canal joins old bed of river. Road continues over slightly undulating ground, the lower portions of which are liable to form swamps in flood season. These can be avoided by keeping closer to the bank of the river.

From 51 the camping ground the road runs N.W. direct to the bend of the river at Shidhaif ruins (mile 5). Plentiful scrub is available there for fuel, and watering is easy from Tigris. Also there is a good camp site on fairly high ground. From here the road runs due north for about i a mile over sandy soil covered with scrub. It then , runs due west for 5 miles passing over extensive ruins. The going is good. At mile 16 the road runs to within 1 mile of the Tigris, and a camp site can be found at this point, but fuel is scarce and watering difficult, owing to the steepness of the banks. Good fuel and easy watering can be obtained about 1 mile further along the river bank. Road^is fit for motor traffic. 4 ’AZIZIYAH . . 10.—General direction of stage N.N.W. From 61 the last camping ground at Umm at Tubul, the road runs over bare ground to within 2 miles of ’Aziziyah. Scrub commences again here and the road is very dusty. A certain amount of scrub jungle is available for fuel near” the village of ’Aziziyah and watering is easy from the Tigris. Camping ground.—Unlimited space, standing fairly high. It may be reckoned to be dry in flood season unless a particularly high flood causes a spill at Lajj, in which case the flood-water may reach ’Aziziyah and even Dabuni. The village consists of about 30 mud houses and a few shops. There is no cultivation, and no supplies can be counted on. There is a telegraph office.

(If these marshes are found^ impracticable, an alternative route may be taken as follows: —Leaving ’Aziziyah, the route runs N.E. to the Nahrwan canal, which is followed until the marshes are passed. A detour of about 25 miles is thus made to Zuwair or Robaida. The going is fairly good in all seasons. At mile there is a thickly wooded bend (Qutuniyah) giving a good supply of fire wood. Here there are easy watering places in the dry season, but in the flood season the banks are steep and watering difficult. From Qutuniyah the road runs N.W. There is a continuation of the marsh on the right of the road, but it is practicable for wheeled transport except during an exceptionally high rise. The road runs direct to Zuwair close alongside the telegraph line. . If necessary, an alternative route may be taken from Qutuniyah due north for about 4 miles, passing beyond the telegraph line across a marl plateau; then turning due west to Zuwair. The' Zuwair camping ground is about £ a mile north of Zuwair. Two and a half miles south of Zuwair is the compara tively high ground of Bagdadie. Firewood is plentiful at a distance of 1 mile from camping ground in the grounds of Muhammad Pasha Daghistani’s house at Robaida. Watering is difficult for a large number of animals. 6 BUST AN . . . 15.—General direction of stage W.N.W. From 91 Zuwair the going is good, except after rain, when it becomes heavy. At mile 2 Muhammad Pasha Daghistani’s house is passed on the left (south) side of the road at a distance from it of about 2 miles. Near this house is a good camping site on fairly high grdund. A branch telegraph line here crosses the Tigris on two high poles, which form a good landmark, to Jumaisah (also called Jazirah and Suwairah) a village on the right bank, and the headquarters of the Jazirah Qadha. A few supplies can be obtained here, and there is a telegraph office. At mile 8 , the road crosses an old spill channel by an embankment about 80 yards long and 30 feet wide. Breadth of this depression is about 40 yards; depth about 20 feet, with steep banks. When the Tigris is low the depression.164 Route No. 8— contd. can be crossed by all arms close to the river bank. If the embankment were breached, the channel would require to be bridged. At mile 15 the road strikes the river at Bustan, Camping. —Good, on fairly high ground. Fuel .—Plentiful from scrub. Watering at Bustan.—Easy at all seasons. 7 DIALAH . . . 12.—General direction of stage N.N.W. At mile 103 2 the road passes to the east of Ctesiphon (Sulman Pak) where there are several irrigation canals, about 15 feet wide. These are already bridged, but would require some improvement. There are no supplie- nor fuel obtainable at Ctesiphon. There is good watering in the vicinity of the Mudir’s house, which is on the river bank about 1 mile north-west of the village. A good site for a camp ing ground may be found on the sandhills close to the Ct'esiphon Arch, which forms a most conspicuous landmark. At mile 44 the road crosses some sandhills and three canals, which are spanned by brick bridges. The canals are about 12 feet deep and 15 feet wide. At mile 5J the village of Qusaibah is passed. Between Qusaibah and Dialah the road does not touch the river. The whole of it is liable to floods. There . are a few shallow canals to be crossed, but these do not form any obstacle to movement. The high poles carrying the telegraph wire across the river at Dialah are visible from Qusaibah. At Dialah there is no fuel. Watering .—Easy from the Tigris. Camping .—Unlimited space available in the dry season on either bank of the Dialah. In the wet season both banks are liable to flood, and the best camping ground, with plentiful fuel and easy watering, is on the high ground on the right bank at BLstan Mai Tromba in a loop of the River. Dialah, 4 miles from left bank of the Tigris. From this latter camping ground a good road runs direct into Baghdad. On the Dialah River there are 6 pumping houses, 5 of which are on right bank. In. vicinity of the 5th, counting from south to north, and about 10 miles north of Dialah, is a ford called Tromba al Tufik Bey, but the river is unfordable from December to April.

It is impracticable for wheeled traffic from the latter place to Baghdad owing to the narrowness and weakness of the bridges over the numerous irrigation canals. The road for wheeled traffic strikes off north from the Qararah Road at Dibayi Saidah (mile 4). At mile 7£ it crosses the large flood bank close to the telegraph line, and goes direct to the infantry barracks south of the city, whence it runs to the Bab Ash Sharqi Gate via the small flood bank, and the moat.

Fairly good going can be obtained by striking S.W. from the bridge and joining the Musaiyib road which runs practically N. and S. about 5 or 6 miles out. There are no obstacles on this road until close to where it touches the river at Khur where cultivation is reached and canals cross the road. The Khur river is crossed by an iron suspension bridge in good repair. A conspicuous landmark is the high two-storey toll-house on the right bank of the Khur River. From Khur the road runs along an embankment to Baghdad, though in the dry season the drivers prefer running on the desert level on the east side of the embankment. The road crosses a level-cross ing on the railway. Several brick or concrete viaducts pierce the embankment. Note on—R outes up Tigris from Kut to Baghdad as affected by: — (a) Floods, and on alternative movements so as to outflank floods. (b) Natural obstacles.168 Route No. 8— contd. (c) Supplies. (d) Drinking Water. (e) Depots and stages. (/) Tactical configuration of tract. (g) Navigation. (h) Tribes. 1. Throughout the tract in question no permanent lake (of the nature of the Suwaikieh Lake) is believed to exist. Defiles similar to that at Hannah are not to be expected on either bank of the Tigris during low river season (September to December inclusive, or even during January and February). 2. But bv mid March the river is in full flood and then,' as practically the whole country is commanded by high flood level, the question of whether any particular locality adjoining the river is or is not under water simply depends on the efficacy of the marginal bunds. 3. There are, however, certain localities which are more subject to flood than others, viz.:— On left bank— (a) Near Shaikh Ja’ad. (b) Whole stretch from Lajj downstream to ’Aziziyah, or, in times of very high flood, even as far down as Dibuni reach. (c) From Qusaibah to the Dialah and thence onwards to Baghdad. On right bank— (d) In Hussaini Reach (half way to Shaikh Ja ad). (e) In Babuni Reach. (/) From Seleucia to Rahmaniyah (Ctesiphon neighbour hood. 4. As regards defiles apt to be formed by these floods: — Left bank — (a) At Shaikh Ja’ad there is low-lying ground close to Tigris left bank—and a very narrow defile would be met there. Outside the low lying ground again there to spr tffc witlRoute No. 8— contd. would be another defile, say 6 miles wide, with its outer flank formed by the upper Suwaikieh marsh. (b) The most noteworthy defile in the Dubuni-Aziziyah-Lajj stretch is from ’Aziziyah to Zuwair. By sticking to the river bank here a Force would run its head into a narrow defile if the floods were out. But out side of the flood is open country (see Route Report). (c) Qusaibah-Dialah-Baghdad. All liable to flood and the best road runs 4 miles wide of the river in its latter portion. Right bank— (d) Hussaini is a likely point for a breach, and the tail of a flood so formed approaches so close to the Liquorice Factory flood as nearly to join up, thence onwards the defile opens but nowhere beyond a width of 4 miles in high flood. To turn the outer flank of the inundation would take one anything up to 40 miles wide of the Tigris. (e) Similarly a flood from Dabuni (another customary spill) point would bottle a force in a defile about 3 miles wide and 10 miles long from Baghailah upwards. Turning possibility same as for Hussaini flood. (/) ’Abdullah Abu Muatif (a little upstream of ’Aziziyah) is another natural escape, a flood from which hugs the Tigris particularly closely and is apt to join up with the Dabuni flood so the question of outflanking is the same in both cases. (g) Perhaps the best known of all the natural escapes for Tigris is that near Seleucia. Flood water from this may extend any distance up to 25 miles in a southerly direction. 5. From the above it is plain that the left bank is preferable to the right in flood season (witness its use by the Turks this spring). In the dry season there is little to choose between the two banks in this respect except that the road runs along the left bank; an advance along either is comparatively simple. 6 . Practicability of route, and of movement off the road, with note on obstacles.170 Route No. 8 — contd. The Road .-—We have news about 2 days old that the Turks have now got the road along the left bank into excellent order. It crosses the Dialah river by a bridge of 13 boats near the con fluence of that river with the Tigris at which point it is 1-0 yards wide. Obstacles .—The Dialah. Other crossings of the Dialah are bv a ford at Tromba-al-Tuftq Bey (10 miles upstream of con fluence), by a ferry at Safweh (4 miles further upstream), and by boat bridges at Bubriz and Ba’qubah. The Dialah is unford- able from S December to April, and generally speaking, its banks are precipitous and 30 feet high; its bed is of soft sand For some miles upstream of its confluence with the Tigris the right bank of the Dialah commands the left. Upstream of this, the command (where any exists) alternates from bank to bank. The Kharr. The onlv serious obstacle to movement on the right bank in low river season is the river Kharr which covers the suburbs of Baghdad from the S.W. Ihis is a stream 2.i feet deep and 120 feet wide with a soft bottom. The Baghdad- Karbala road crosses it by an iron bridge. From 2 miles south of Qararah up to Baghdad the country is a network of canal, and the rivei bank road is thereby rendered unfit for whe Is But these are avoided by a road which encircles them and enters Baghdad from the south-east. Heavily cropped country on left bank close to Baghdad. Other Obstacles.—With, the exceptions above quoted {viz floods, 2 rivers and the Qarareh irrigation) the country from but to Baghdad, on or wide of the Tigris banks, furnishes no ob stacle to wheeled transport that cannot be negotiated by ramp ing. Willcocks—p. 44, Irrigation of Mesopotamia—refers to deep and wide ravines between Tigris and the old Nahrwan canal— but this refers to the track N. and E. of Baghdad. In the tract under consideration, no obstacle more formid able than the Lajj spill channel referred to below is likely to be met with. Irrigation canals (dry except at high river) are very rumer- ous; notable examples on left bank are : At 5th mile from Kut—water cut which the road crosses by a stone bridge.171 ie Turks it order, the con- is lid alah are of con- and by * unford- 3 banks 1.

At Shidhaif—a nullah, the bridge over which was destroyed by Townshend’s rearguard in the Ctesiphon retirement. A little upstream of ’Aziziyah—several cuts 12 feet vide* At Zuwair—a dry canal 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep, lihicii had to be heavily ramped at the time of the Ctesiphon advance. Near Ctesiphon—several canals 15 feet wide over which the road is carried by brick bridges. These cuts are dry except at high river. Also the Lajj spill channel—40 yards wide and in places 20 feet deep, with steep banks. All the above are passable by ramping. And although details are not actually available conditi-.ns on right bank are known to be similar—a column of all arms of Nur ed Din’s force retreated (and made remarkably good time) up the right bank after the battle of Kut-al-Amarah in September 1915. 7. Supplies.—A limited number of sheep and cattle can be obtained normally from villages and Arab encampments en route, also considerable quantities of bhoosa and grain for the last stage of an advance by right bank, supplies could be reckoned on at Mahmudiyah (on Karbala road). Camel grazing is plentiful; for horses there is very little. Fuel .—Scrub jungle is plentiful. 8 . Water .—If it be a question of turning an inundation in the flood season in order to avoid a defile the flood water would be available. To provide for a movement wide of the river in the low water season, we have no record of any water existing away from the Tigris. As regards likely sites for getting water by digging—the Mardj depression which runs from east of Balad Ruz to the country north of Kut would furnish likely spots but is too far afield for our purpose. The trace of the old Nahrwan canal of course runs along a watershed and is an unlikely line- best results are likely to be obtained along the natural drainage line, intermediate between the Nahrwan trace and the Tigris ■(vide Willcock’s Plan No. 2)—this approaches the Tigris at Shaikh Ja’ad and Nahr Kellak, is about 1| miles wide of it at ’Aziziyah, 3 miles at Zuwair and 6 miles at Ctesiphon. Enquiries172 Route No. 8— contd. are being made as to possibilities of finding water by digging, along this line. On the right bank there are two natural drainage lines run ning roughly parallel to and at respective approximate distance of 4 and li miles from the Tigris. The possibilities of these also are being investigated. Mahmudiyah would be convenient as a penultimate halting place for an advance by right bank, as there is good canal water there for 9 months out of the year. 9. Convenient places for depots are:—* Nahr Kellak . . . . ^ ’Aziziyah . . . . ^ All used during Ctesi* Bustan I phon advance. Dialah . . . . . J (None of these can be reckoned to be above high flood level. But this is no practical hindrance, for any particular locality on the Tigris banks can always be rendered flood proof by ring bunding.) 10. Convenient stages along the route are Length of stage.

As regards tactical configuration—command of one bank of the river by the other is not very marked. It occurs at Baghdad, i.e., near Zuwair where the right bank commands the \Route jS’o. 8— contd. left. Generally speaking, at a bend, the re-entrant bank com mands the salient bank. Simultaneous use of both banks by a force moving upstream would be suitable (a mobile bridge of course being assumed)— a suggested distribution is : —a maximum Force of two Divisions on rignt bank, with a minimum Force of 1 Division plus Strate gical Cavalry on left bank—left bank force to guard shipping at bends where the Tigris wings wide of the right bank road. 12. Navigation. —Some of the worst shallows in the whole river lines from Basrah to Baghdad lie upstream of Kut. Note- able instances are: — Sharish (a little upstream of Baghailah). Shidhaif (a little upstream of Nahr Kellak). Lajj. Khamasah (between Lajj and Bustan). Qusaibah (between Bustan and Dialah). In these reaches low river soundings shallow down to 3 feet, and at such times ships are. constantly aground. A railway should most certainly accompany the advance of any large force. The Jirf-al-Battah pear-drop bend near Ctesiphon (better known as the Harrea Reach) is now out of action, the Tigris having short-circuited there in the 1915 flood season. 13. Tribal Matters. —The following are the local tribes that would be met with: — Left Bank.—Shammar Toqah—fighting men, 1,200. At pre sent, like all other tribes upstream of us, hostile. But certain sections of the tribe (e.g., those of Sheikhs Adai al Jhirian and Hamud as Safukh) were ready enough to make advances to us in October 1915 as soon as’ they knew we proposed an advance beyond Kut and they would do so again. (The occupation- of Kut would automatically settle the now hostile ’Amarah section of the Bani Rabi’ah—2,500 fighting men, Shaikh Muhammad-al-Amir.) Right Bank.—Zubaid—fighting men 1 , 200 . At present hostile. Sections of the tribe would come in as we advanced.174 Route No. 8 — concld. (As in the ease of their fellow-tribesmen on the left bank, the capture of Kut would bring into us the right bank Bani-Rabi ah, viz., the Sarai section—2,000 fighting men, Shaikh Muham- mad-al-Gussab.) These Arabs respond to force majeure and to nothing else. They are of little use as auxiliaries—an attempt to raise 50 of the Shammar Toqah last October to help guard our L. of C. failed. They were comparatively quiet during our advance m November, and their action against the retreating Turks, after the battle of Kut-al-Amarah, is not believed to have been particularly effective.

The stage is passable by all arms in the dry season but is impassable by wheeled traffic after heavy rain or in high floods. The start ing point is mile east of the Turkish Isolation Hospital. The ground is mostly flat, but slightly undulating in places, with, as far as mile 5, a line of sand dunes 15 to 20 feet high run ning parallel to and north of the tract. At mile 9 the Du’aiji ■canal is passed. It forms no obstacle. From here on the route is quite impassable for wheeled traffic except from the middle of August until the rains break (in November or December) and is extremely difficult for horses and mules, being boggy in places and often under water. At mile 14 the Nahr Abul Arabid, which here forms the Persian frontier is crossed, and at miles 164 the small village of Arith is passed on the right. Manduwan is a small village some 3 miles from the Shatt-al-’Arab on the eastern bank of the Nahr Khaiyain, a small creek which supplies it with water. Fuel .—A certain amount of brushwood available.

The track is suitable for all arms in the dry season but is under water in the wet. At mile 8 the route strikes an impassable marsh and skirts its northern edge. The country to the north and west is all flat, open desert. There is a good site for a camp on the bank of the Karun at the elbow 2|- miles' north of Salmaneh. Water from the river. Grazing for camels is available, but for no other animals. This stage was traversed by 33rd Cavalry in April 1915. SAB’EH 58 22.—Compass bearing of the stage is 360°. The route is passable for all arms, and a motor-car could do the march at slow speed. There is no sign of a road and the “ going” is on the soft side with treacherous boggy spots. At mile 2 Rehvali is passed on the right. There are a few pools of water in the bed of the Hammamiyah at mile 7£, and in the ’Aon at mile 12 there is good water for horses but too muddy for men, These two and the other water cuts met with are quite minor obstacles. Shortly after passing the ’Aon, the Tomb of Saiyid Abud comes in sight and forms a conspicuous landmark, and from mile 15|-, two miles before the tomb is passed the date trees of Sab’eh can be seen. If this stage be considered too long, a halt may be made opposite Adhrat Island, where there is scanty grazing for horses l^- miles west of camp and good camel grazing. There is a convenient site for barges on the Karun to come alongside at this point. This divides the stage into two stages of 9 and 15 miles respectively, the extra distance being due to following the river in the first of these stages. The village of Sab’eh is merely a miserable collection of huts. There is a convenient site on the Karun for barges to come alongside. Tamarisk bushes grow freely and form an abundance of fuel. The plain in the vicinity is more or less cultivated and a limited quantity of “ khasil ” is available in season; there is also fair grazing for horses in the vicinity, a sweet smelling variety of grass^ known in Persian as “ Gul-i-zard ” being found in some abund ance also good camel grazing.

Aminiyeh is a village of 65 mud houses. A certain amount of wheat and barley is cultivated and there is good camel grazing. Excellent water from the Karun river and a good steamer landing. Aminiyeh is situated below the Ahwaz rapids and nearly opposite to Bandar Nasiri, which is about 1 mile from Ahwaz and is connected with it by a horse tramway, and which latter is also the starting point of the “Lynch” road from Ahwaz to Isfahan, which traverses the Bakhtiari country. There is a ferry between Aminiyeh and Bandar Nasiri. GHADIR ILLAH 10.—General direction of stage, N.W. Vide stage 1, Route 10. 9.—General direction of stage, N.W. Good desert track.

Authorities .—Reports from 12tli Division, Meso potamia Expeditionary Force, June 1915, and Gazetteer of Persian Gulf, Vol. II. General Description .—The route skirts the S. W., foot hills of the Manyur Range as far as Ulah on the Karkheh River, crosses the river there ancTcontinues parallel to its right bank to Bisaitin, just west of which place the Karkheh loses itself in the marshes. From Bisaitin the route skirts the northern edge of the Zubair marshes to a point opposite Khur Ubaid, then crosses the marshes (Khot) to the left (north) bank of the Muhsarrah Canal and follows the canal bank to ’Amarah. The chief obstructions are the Karkheh river at IHah and the crossing of the “ Khor ” opposite Khur Ubaid. With the above exceptions, the route is comparatively good and suitable for all arms. The route is in most places entirely undefined, indeed the Turkish Field Force in 1915 marked it on their outward journey by big mounds of earth so as to indicate the way back. Water .—With the exception of Illah, Khafajiyeh and Bisaitin where excellent river water is obtainable, the water is brackish and bad and is likely to have bad effects on men and animals, particularly at Thailah and Mazlak. Furthermore, as the water ing of animals has at most of the stages to be done from the “ Khor,” and as the edge of the “ Khor ” is usually very shallow, the water heats up to such an extent during the day, during the summer, that it is found impossible to water animals between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. Grazing —There is sparse camel grazing at Illah, Khafajiyeh, Bisaitin and Thailah, but none beyond till the bank of the Musharrah is reached. There is also sparse horse and mule grazing along the edge of the Zubair Marsh. Before commencing a march along this route, animals should be made accustomed to eating a big barley ration in view of the scanty fodder available.180 Route No. 10 — contd. Supplies .—No supplies can be relied upon. Fuel.—There is sufficient low scrub along the route to furnish fuel for cooking. GHADIR —General direction of stage N.W.

These hills can be traversed by troops (though with difficulty by Cavalry). They form a good Artillery posi tion. Water from pond brackish but drinkable: its supply is not to be relied on in the dry season. 2 ILLAH . . . 9.—General direction of stage N.W. No village 19 at Illah. Water abund ant and good from Karkheh River on the left bank of which stage is situated opposite the shrine A1 Muhsin, 3 miles upstream of the ruined fort of Kut-al-Hawashim, which is situated at the elbow bend, about 8 miles down stream from Kut-Nahr-Hashim. The Karkheh is a very considerable river and presents a very formidable obstacle. In May 1915, Gorringe Columfi found it 300 yards wide and . very ’ strong current. Unfordable. Few boats available. No bridging materials exist locally. 3 KHAFAJIYEH . . 15.—General direction of stage N.W. The route 34 skirts the foot hills of the Manyur range, where the desert is firm and hard and always passable for all arms—closer to the river the country is inters sected by frequent irrigation canals.

The inhabitants are Bani Turuf. There is a good camping ground on rising sandy soil one mile from the river. Unhusked rice and rice straw are usually available, but no other grain. Water from the Khor. 4 BISAITIN . . . 18.—General direction of stage N.W. The track 52 continues parallel to the Karkheh River, but at a distance of three miles from it (avoiding the marsh which extends along the right bank of the river) and is good hard going at all seasons. At mile 5 the village of Khanizeh is passed on the left at a distance of over three miles; this village is unapproachable from the north. Basaitin is a Bani Turf village of some 450 huts scattered over a large area on the left bank of the Karkheh River. There is a good camping ground one mile north of the village with plenty of brushwood in the vicinity. The grazing is poor. Water from “ Khor.” 5 THAILAH (or SAIL AH) 11.—General direction of stage N.W. for the first 63 eight miles, then W. The going is poor, the ground being pitted with rat holes and sandy which makes it necessary for wheeled transport to select its route with care, additional obstacles in the shape of sand hills being met with at miles 2% and 5. There is no village at Thailah. The water is from the Khor, which is brackish and salt to the taste and produces a feeling of nausea, loss of appetite and energy, and diarrhoea. The camel and horse grazing is poor. Sufficient low scrub is available for fuel and slightly better fuel can be got from the sand hills a mile from camp. Ground infested with mosquK toes. Umm Chir is on the Turko-Persian border. 5 MAZLAK . . . 12.—General direction of stage, west for the first 75 five miles through Umm Chir then south-west. Going is flat and good, the only obstructions being five small watercourses, 6 to 10 feet wide, easily made passable for guns and transport in a few minutes by small working parties. There is no village at Mazlak. The'■■■■■■■■■■■ 182 Route No. 10— contd . water is from the “ Khor ” and is brackish and bad, and very shallow. 6 SHATT-AL-AMA . . 12.—General direction of stage N.W. Going 87 hard and good to with in one mile from camp when the ground becomes rough and covered with scrub. There is no village at Shatt-al-Ama. The water is from the “ Khor” but is somewhat better than at the last two camps. 7 KHUR UBAID . . 6£.—General direction of stage N.W. The 93J camping ground is on the northern edge of the marsh which—only 2,000 yards wide at this point—separates the camping ground from the northern bank of the Musharrah Canal (Khur Ubaid itself with its conspicuous conical mud tower is on the southern bank of the canal, about two miles upstream from Halfiyah). The water of the “ Khor ” here is considerably better than at Umm Chir and Mazlak, but it is advisable to bring drinking water from the Musharrah Canal by boat. The foreshore of the marsh is sandy unstable soil, and does not easily lend itself to the dig ging of practicable waterways by which boats can overcome the shallowness of the water, as the soil will not stand. The marsh is full of reeds, suitable for “ cushioning ” roads, pier, etc. Timber. — Nil. 8 ’AMARAH . . . 17^.—The route crosses the “ Khor ” to the north- 111 ern bank of the Mushar rah Canal just opposite Khur Ubaid (the depth of the water varying from a few inches to 5 feet), and then follows the left (north) bank of the Musharrah Canal. For the first 2 miles going upstream from Khur Ubaid the left bank of the canal is under water in the flood season, and a serious obstacle is met with almost at once in the shape of a deep cut through the canal bank with a strong current flowing from the marshes. It is, therefore, necessary to convey guns and wheeled transport by boat or raft to mile 2 upstream of Khur Ubaid, but thence on wards the canal bank is dry at all seasons of the year, the only other remaining real obstacles being two branch canals, the first of which it is possible to cross by ramping the banks, but theBoute No. 10— contd. second requires bridging when the water is high. The Mushar- rah Canal is some 30 yards wide with a minimum depth of 3 feet and a current of some 3 miles an hour. On arrival opposite ’Amarah, the Musharrah canal has to be crossed. This can be done by boat near where the canal leaves the Tigris north of ’Amarah, and there is also a trestle bridge for foot traffic at this point. After the Musharrah Canal the Jalahah Canal remains to be crossed before reaching ’Amarah itself. This latter canal is some 60 yards wide (there is a bridge of boats across it now) unbridged and unfordable. But there are ample ferry boats. ’Amarah stands on a strip of land enclosed on the west by the Tigris and on the north and east by the Jahalah Canal. It has a river frontage of more than 1 a mile on the Tigris. The southern quarter of the town consists of a row of 27 modern houses forming six large blocks facing the river. The military barracks and principal government buildings are in the northern quarter. The population is about 10,000. On the right bank of the Tigris opposite ’Amarah are flourishing plantations of dates and other fruit trees and poplars in the midst of which is the suburb of Daffas. The Tigris is spanned by a bridge of boats. The neighbouring country raises large numbers of cattle and a considerable quantity of wheat, barley, maize, rice and ghi is also produced.

General direction north-west, passing wells of Umm-ul- Haiyil, } mile north of track at 4J miles, perennial wells 20', 30' deep plenty of camel thorn near by. At nine miles sandhills of Raml-i-Shumakh-Neh lie miles south; they afford abundant cover to cavalry and infantry, and are passable, though with difficulty by the former; height about 60 feet, they form a triangle with sides about 2 miles long, re-entrant formed on south being good gun position. Water lies in pools till end of March, sometimes later, and is obtained from shallow wells dug by Arabs each year in the sand. The only other place where water is found is Tal-i-Zibid and Deh Diz, 2 miles south of Raml-Shumukhneh, where there are wells like those at Umm-ul-Haiyil. At 10 miles an isolated clump of rocks some 6 ; high is passed just south of the track; this is the point where the track to Kut Saiyid Ali diverges from that running to Kut Nahr Hashin. At about this point the white domed shrine of Muhsin on the right bank of the Karkhah opposite Kut Nahr Hashin becomes visible, and cultivation (unirrigated) begins. At 15-| miles the track which is not well marked, approaches the dry bed of the old Karkhah. The sides of this would require ramping almost everywhere for wheeled traffic, but are passable for cavalry every few hundred yards and for infantry -everywhere. There is extensive wheat cultivation round here and remains of old canals which afford some cover, but present no serious obstacle. At about 17|- miles the deserted village of D-eh Saiyid Musa stands on the right bank of the dry bed of the Karkhah and is a good landmark to steer for from the rocks mentioned above. At 18 miles the dry bed is crossed. This consists of a deep cut ting some 20' deep and 30 yards wide, filled in in places with brushwood. The bed is hard almost all the year round and consists of mud covered with grass.

Route No. 10— contd . The ruins of an old fort lie here on the south side of the dry bed which could be adapted to form a defensive post. It consists of a square enclosure, about 40 yards long surrounded by a mound about four feet high and a ditch. The left bank of the Karkhah above the salient is shelving for a mile or more; and animals can go down to drink. At the turn and for a mile or two down stream, the left bank is preci pitous. The water is abundant and exceedingly pure, width of river about 60 yards, depth from 20 feet in floods to nine feet in autumn.* At this point which would be a good place for a camp, a little^ firewood is obtainable (it is very plentiful 10 miles up river at Sinn-al-Abbas). Grazing is poor and cannot be taken into account. The track now runs along the left bank of the Kharkhah at _ a^ distance of from I to 1 mile to a large village called Kut Saiyid ’Ali, consisting of about 150 houses and situated 5 miles from the fort on the right bank of the Kharkhah. Firewood is stored in large quantities in the village (estimated at 50 tons a 11 the year round). This amount is due to the fact that this village is the first and closest one to the natural wood supply at Sinn-al-Abbas, and little scrub brushwood to the west of the village. Supplies 5,000 sheep, 500 cattle, no grain, no transport animals available. The grazing is poor. Only about 10 mashufs (marsh boats) could be collected from this 'village. The population is about 500. This is the place favoured by ' Arabs for crossing as it is a straight reach with a depth of about as a minimum in summer (in places, such as Khafajiyah— 10 miles below Kut Saiyid ’Ali) it is actually fordable for three months (September to November), also there are other fords reported up river from Kut Nahr Hashim but they have not been definitely located. The ground on the left bank of the Kharkheh is intersected by deep canals and is unsuitable for anything but infantry and lightly laden mules. It is impassable for wheeled traffic and guns, also in spring and early summer for both cavalry and * Current is J mile per hour in summer to 2 miles per hour as a maximum at flood time, which may occur at various times between December and April (both inclusive). t■■BnRHHMaMMBBHMHi 186 Route No. 10 — contd . infantry, so caravans generally cross to the right bank at a spot 200 yards east of the village. 2 KHAFAJIYAH . . 10.—From Kut Saiyid ’Ali on the right bank the 36 best track runs parallel to the river, and at a distance of one or two miles from it over ground cultivated in places; track is fit for all arms.

The Shatt-al-Ama is crossed for the first time at about 8 miles; it is here a mere depression with occasional pools of water in spring. The country is open, and there is a good deal of brushwood about; grazing nil. The Shatt-al-Ama (blind river) is crossed again by some tracks, but not by others. All tracks are good and hard going the whole way. It is deep narrow ditch dry except after heavy lain, some 15' deep and 20 yards across; hard bottom with brushwood growing; it would require ramping for wheeled traffic but is passable almost everywhere for cavalry. The Dawairij river is met at 25 miles. At this point it is flowing southwards, but bending back it turns north-west and is lost in marshes. The Dawairij is drinkable all the year round, but slightly brackish in autumn; it is fordable except for a week or so after heavy rain.

Bullocks are useless and carts should not be taken. Pack transport is by far the best. (See note by Lieutenant- Colonel Lucas.) 5. Fuel. —Very' scarce, only brushwood in small quantities being available (except in the neighbourhood of Barjisiyah plantation). 6. Grazing. —For camels only, except at Khamsieh. Note by Lieutenant-Colonel F. G. Lucas. Pack transport is the only suitable transport for the dry weather as the roads become dusty and the surface breaks up. The worst parts are where the road leaves the old Turkish Army tracks and branches of to the camping grounds. Bullocks are useless for transport as they have no heart. The country camels have been a great success .... They move faster than the Indian camels and can easily do 3 miles an hour. Carts are not satisfactory, as they are too hard on the mules The best transport for sick and wounded would be “ Kaiawas on camels TroopsRoute No. 16— contd. marching in hot weather should be warned to look out for scorpions and snakes (poisonous, but species unknown).

Follow this road on to the Shaiba Ridge to within a mile of Zobeir, and thence straight along the ridge to Shaiba Fort. The old bed of the Euphrates is crossed about 1,200 yards north-west of the tele graph line. The bed is soft, but in early April 1916, was pass able for Fiat lorries and Army Transport Carts. Should this river bed be flooded, wheeled transport will not be able to cross. Surface conditions on this section of road are very variable, and the ground should be reconnoitred a day previous to any march.196 Route No. 16— contd. The water at Shaiba Fort is good. There is one well 100 yards south-west of .the Fort, 12 feet in diameter, 25 feet to the water level and about 6 feet of water. This well gives a supply of excellent water, sufficient for a Brigade, and should be re served for the men. Pumps should be erected before the troops arrive and a 30 feet length of hose should be taken. The second well is of about the same capacity as No. 1. It is about 400 yards north-east of the Fort. It is worked by donkeys and is suitable for watering animals. The 3rd well (about the same size) is roughly 800 yards north-east of the Fort. The water in this well requires frequent changing before it becomes fit for use, even for animals. For a force of the strength of a Brigade, 4 pumps would be required at No. 1 well for drinking water and 2 pumps at No. 2 for animals. Canvas troughs or tarpaulins should also be provided at No. 2 well. Camping space. —Unlimited. * Fuei. —Some brushwood to supplement wood ration. 2 CHUWAIBDAH . . 8.—General direction of the stage S. W. by 21 W. March on a com pass bearing of 45° for 4 miles to near Barjisiyah Wood, and thence 4 miles to camp on a bearing of 95°, following the main caravan track. This stage is passable for all arms and in early April 1916, Fiat lorries and Army Transport carts passed over it. Water. —The wells are too small and shallow. Larger wells should be dug north of the main caravan track and they should be rivetted on the inside to prevent falling earth from the edges filling them up. The water is abundant, but slightly brackish, though it becomes sweeter after the wells have been in use for a short time. Pumps are essential, as otherwise the edges of the well fall in if men stand round drawing water in buckets. Fuel. —Some brushwood obtainable. Grazing. —For camels only. 3 GRAIN AT . . . 15.—General direction of the stage N.W. by 36 N. The road (in April 1916) was passable for Fiat lorries and Army TransportRoute No. 16— contd. carts.

Lucas, 42nd Infantry Brigade. (Dated 27th May 1916.) From Nakhailat to Grainat the going is difficult for wheeled transport. Water .—Brackish in shore but sweet about 300 yards out (1st May 1916). The distance from the shore at which sweet water is found probably varies. Bellums drawing 3 feet of water were brought within 100 yards of the shore on 1st May, 1916.

From here north-west, skirting more sand hills and over a harder surface following the tracks of the Turkish Army retreat in 1915. An exhausting stage for draught animals. There is a good landing place at Allow! Point one mile north-east of- Allow! Ruins. Stores landed here, however, could only be removed along the shore in the direction of Grainat as elsewhere for a radius of a mile the ground is too damp. Water .—Brackish in shore but sweet about 400 yards out. Bellums caBrying 4 taghar (say 20 maunds) can be unloaded on the island feature north of Ratawi, but when the river is in flood the lowlying land between Ratawi and the island will have to be crossed by a causeway.

Bellums drawing 3' 6' can be brought up to within 50 yards of the shore in flood season. There is ample camping ground in the vicinity of the water. Grazing. —For camels only. Fuel. —Brushwood in small quantities. 6 LAG AIT . . . 16£.—General direction of the stage W. by N. 77 • Bather heavy going for wheeled transport. Lagait is situated between 2 maunds, one close to the waters edge and the other i mile in land. Passable for motor lorries. Troops marching from Ghaba shiyah to Lagait should keep 1,000 yards from the waters edge. Good water at Lagait. Camp can be pitched close to the w T aters edge on the high ground.

After heavy rains the country within a radius of 2 miles of Khamsiyah is flooded to a depth of about six inches. During this season troops should camp near Tal Ibarah Fort which is miles east of Khamsiyah. When there is no flood troops would camp close to Kham siyah, where a creek runs north for 10 miles to Suk-esh-Sheyukh. Fuel. — Nil. Water. —Flood.

At 44 miles pass an unfinished fort which should be left on°the right hand so as to avoid another deep ditch which runs from the fort to the water. Water. —Very dirty and brackish. (Would probably be better two miles further east.) General bearing of the march about 305°. Zellah is an area 'which extends for 11 miles, 10 miles from Khamsiyah.

Distance. —Nasiriyah—Kut about 120 miles, 9 stages. 3. Water .—The only difficulty is from Nasiriyah to Decha Suwaij about 25 miles, too long a distance for a normal infantry march unless troops are quite “ fit. There is no water obtainable except by making a detour (which adds on 2 or 3 miles) to Albut Nija, and here from August inclusive till the first rains (December), the water is brackish and bad, though Arabs say it can be drunk. If practicable it would be safer to carry water from this stage. From Suwaij to Kut there is no difficulty, as even when bed is dry, good water can be had anywhere by digging from 3 to 6 feet. 4. Supplies .—Owing to uncertainty as to attitude of Arab tribes, no supplies should be relied on.

(b) Water Routes. In nornaal years there is no through water route from Nasiri- yah to Shatrah. This year (1915) owing to exceptionally high water, the Turks were able twice to put convoys of small heliums through by the Umm Jamal Channel. This was only possible for about 3 weeks. Normally in the flood season large heliums pass up the Khor Husainiyah in the flood season from the Euphrates to the north east limit of this Khor, which may be within 6 miles of Suwaij. From Suwaij to Abu Mahaw, the Shatt-ash-Shatrah is about 12 feet broad and about 2 feet 6 inches deep in the flood season; passable then for heliums of medium size. This channel is dry or at least useless as a waterway, from August to February (?). From Abu Mahaw to Kut, the Shatt-al-Gharaf is passable for steamers of 4|- feet draft from February to June, and they turn at Abu Mahaw. During July it is normally passable for small202 Route No. IT — concld. mahailahs, or medium-sized heliums with a minimum draught of about 2' 6 '. It becomes passable for these craft again about November. This year being abnormal, a minimum of 2 ' was reported about 20th August, and a medium-sized helium could still pass. Normally at this time it would be dry with pools and stretches of water at intervals. The only really reliable through route from the south is by the Nahr-al-Bada’ah which carries awaj r much of the water of the Sl^att-al-Gharaf and flows into the Hammar Lake. This route is practicable for large heliums from December to July, and this year in the flood season three motor boats were brought down it, but with considerable difficulty and much local assist ance. There is a broad shallow bar in the Hammar which seldom has more than two feet of water over it. The Nahr Hamsa admits of passage of small heliums only dur ing similar periods. Throughout the greater part of its length the Nahr-al-Beda’ah in the flood season expands into a wide “ khor, ” and its overflow fills numerous parallel side channels. Transport.—Moving northwards from Nasirlyah, land trans port would be necessary throughout. There' are not very many boats at Shatrah normally (say some 30 small heliums and 10 large) and they would very probably be removed before any troops reached the town. If an advance were made from Kut. boats could be brought up the Tigris and so down. Route No. 18. From NAJAF to BASRAH. 28-3 miles. 15 stages. Authorities .—Captain G. E.

The river is crossed by a boat bridge. There is a bazar of some 250 shops, and the place is a much frequented Bedouin market. The neighbourhood is well cultivated, a surplus of cereals, vegetables, and fruit being exported. There are 20,000 date palms, mostly on the south bank, but these are not sufficient for local requirements.

From the Shatt-al-Mulla the road runs eastwards to mile 81 to the right bank of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah, following which in an upward direction to about mile 18 the village of ’Amran is passed, lying about half a mile to the_ westward. _ The way continues up the right bank of the Hindiyah until a point it for 300 opposite to Kifl on the left bank is reached; at this spot the Hindiyah is 200 yards wide. The minaret of Kifl comes in sight shortly after the departure from Najaf; and Khan Musalla, on the Karbala-Najaf road, is described to the left soon after striking the Hindiyah. . 2 TAWATRIJ . . . 13.—N.

The road from Karbala to 10 Nukhailah runs through flat, featureless desert; to the west of it is a veritable ocean of golden sand. There is a large caravansarai 100 yards square with walls 19 feet high on the outside; it would accommodate 400 horses and 300 men. There are the usual open cubicles for sleeping in round the courtyard, and the usual back galleries of stables. V ater is from a well ^ of a mile distant. There are two other small khans (caravansarais) at this place, each of which would hold 50 horses and 20 men. No supplies are obtainable except a little chopped straw. 2 KHAN HAMAD . . 14.—S. E. by S. About midway between 24 ^ Nakhailah and Khan Hamad, a stream 50 yards wide and 4 feet deep, said to be a branch of the Shatt-al-Hindiyah, is twice struck on the left of the road; this appears to be part.of the Si’adah, mentioned again under Route No. 6. Near Khan Hamad the country is flat and featureless; in the direction of the Hindiyah it is cultivated to a considerable extent with low-growing crons. Khan Hamad consists of a large walled enclosure, 250 yards long by 100 yards wide, with 5 caravansarais inside it open-Route No. 20— contd. ing one into the other. In these are the usual arched cubicles with stables behind them. The outer walls of the enclosures- are 18 feet high; and as there are parapets above the roofs of the stables, the whole could be easily defended against rifle fire. There is accommodation for 500 horses and 1,000 men. Besides- the large enclosure there are 2 or 3 small khans and about 50 ordinary mud houses. Water is from wells and is said to be always sufficient, but food and fodder are scanty. To the south of the place is sandy desert, and to the north and east of it are about 400 date trees. -Votf Thainl riders and others do this journey in one stage and travel direct to £aTf' without touching at°Khan Hamad. By so doing the distance is reduced to about 46 miles. 3 KHAN MUSSALA . 12.—S.S.E. The road is (or KHAN MIRZA) sandy for some dist- 36 ance* after leaving Khan Hamad : it runs between the pure desert on the right and low-lying lands, connected with the Hindiyah, on the left;' these last are liable to inundation, but have good grazing during the cold season. About 3 miles short of Khan Musalla the going becomes better. ^Here is a large walled enclosure, containing two ciaravan- sarais which lead one into the other. Outside are 2 small khans and a few coffee shops; and about 200 yards to the east wards are some 30 Arab huts. The place would hold 800 horses' and 600 men, but there are practically no supplies. Water is obtained from wells and from a canal which comes from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah. 4 NAJAF . . . 11.—S.S.E. From Khan Musalla to Najaf the 47 road lies over fine sand and the going is heavy. At mile 11 Najaf, a town of some 30,000 inhabitants, situ ated on a ridge of a reddish sandstone and gravel. It has walls about 30 feet high with circular bastions every 100 yards some 50 feet in diameter. They are gradually falling to ruin. The water-supply of the place is from the Hamidiyah canal, which runs along the base of the ridge. Water for washing is obtained from the Bahr-an-Najaf, but is brackish. There are a few date210 I Route No. 20 — concld. plantations in the dry part of the Bahr-an-Najaf, near the town. The place is, however, otherwise quite destitute of natural resources, being in the desert. All supplies, etc., are imported. There is a large bazar. T. 0. P. 0.

At mile 4, the lake known as the Hor-al-Husai- tilyah approaches the right of the road. The water whichRoute No. 21— contd. escapes from this lake at its north-western corner is used for irrigation, but it sometimes spreads over the road and spoils it in places. About mile 5 or 6 miles the road skirts the village of Sulaimanlyah upon its southern side; and beyond this village is a bad slough which in time of flood can only be passed in boats. At mile 10^ the Dawaihlyah, and at mile 12 the ’Abd ’Auniyat, (both canals from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah) are passed by fording. From mile 11 the route is very sandy. The single line of tele graph which connects Karbala with Tawairli follows the route described and is carried upon iron posts; but at the Dawaihlyab and ’Abd ’Auniyat crossings it is slung upon high wooden masts. Tawairij, an important town, standing on both banks of the Hindiyah at 13 miles below its head. The quarter on the left bank consists of mud houses, a few shops, and a good khan (caravansarai), and is connected by a boat bridge of 21 pon toons with main town on the right bank which contains numerous masonry buildings and the public offices. Altogether there are about 150 shops, 3 mosques, and 4 khans. Popula tion, about 4,000 souls. Abundant water from the Hindiyah. Fuel artd fodder plentiful. A large entrepot for rice; limited quantities of barley and wheat: Camels can only be had when the ’Anizah are in the neighbourhood; but a considerable number of horses and donkeys are procurable in the district, as also buffaloes, cattle, sheep, and goats.

The track itself is intersected by various canals from the Euphrates, which are wider and deeper as Hillah is approached. Those nearest to the town have frail and narrow bridges, neither strong enoug nor wide enough for guns, and without parapet or handrail. The largest of these canals, the Tajiyah, is crossed at mile 12; the enormous accumulations of silt-clearance which line its course make it appear from the distance like a high railway embankment.21 212 \ •Route No. 21 — concld. t From mile 4^ the Birs Nimrud, mound and ruins are visible, ■first to the right front, and then to the front.

General Description .—A road, unmade but fit for driving, .along which public conveyances ply daily. Beyond the point where this road separates from the Karbala road the track is not so well marked. Its character as far as Babylon (mile 56) resembles that of the Karbala route up to Musaiyib, for the country crossed is, apart from a few minor canals and some sporadic cultivation, merely a dry desert of clay. From Baby lon onwards it runs through cultivated country and along the edge of vast date plantations. A double line of telegraph accompanies the road the whole way from Baghdad to Hillah.

The road separates from 35 the Karbala road at about mile 8 , and gradually diverges from it till at Khan-al- Haswah it is 2 miles south-east of Sikandarlyah village on the Baghdad-Karbala road. From mile 8 the country is featureless, but Khan-al-Haswah itself stands upon a slight eminence. This khan is a one-storyed building; it has a courtyard surrounded by 38 arched recesses intended as lodging places for travellers. Behind these recesses are rows of vaulted stables. A parapet wall about 4 feet high runs all round the roof. The courtyard would accommodate 100 men, and the stables 150 animals. Attached to the khan is a village of some 60 domed brick dwellings; 2 coffee shops, and a small Dhabitiyah (gendarme) post. The village owns a few animals, but supplies, except firewood, are practically nil. Some cultivation on the north-west side. 3 KHAN-AL-MAHAWIL 14.—S. Route passes through desert which-, 49 however, is cultivated to some extent on the eastern side of the road. Between mile 5 and mile 9 three canals from the Euphrates cross the- road; the 2 nd and 3 rd are traversed by brick bridges, and the 3rd is apparently the Nasriyah canal from the Euphrates. At mile 8 is Khan-an-Nasrlyah, a deserted lodging on the eastern side of the road. About mile 13^, a small water channel is crossed. Khan-al-MahawIl has walls 18 feet high outside, ^ and is similar to last khan but in worse repair. Attached is a vil lage of about 600 inhabitants; it is surrounded by mud walls 10 feet high and topped with thorns. One coffee shop and a small Dhabitiyah station. A few animals and plenty ot ue , grain scarce. On the south side of the village flows the Maha- wil canal from the Euphrates with a stream in April about 20 feet wide and 12 feet deep. About 50 date palms. _ 4 HILL AH . . • 13.—S.* After crossing the Mahawil canal by a 02 high brick bridge in- bad repair, with a roadway 10 feet wide and 12 feet above the214 Route No. 22— concld . level of the water, the route traverses a plain strewn with debris of old buildings. At mile 4 the Khatunlyah canal is crossed by a brick bridge, and at mile 7 the Nil canal with similar bridge. To mile 10, more debris, being the remains of the city of Babylon, now represented only by the mud-walled village of Kuwairish with about 300 inhabitants. Between here and Hillah the principal canal crossed is the Wardiyah from the Euphrates. Hillah, an important town standing on both banks of the Euphrates, the two parts being connected by a bridge of 15 boats. Town largely built of ancient bricks; population about 30.000 souls; well-built, brick barracks, large public buildings, 2.000 shops, water-supply from holes, about 3 feet deep, dug in the (now dry) river bed. Estimated supplies (1908) : 400 tons of wheat, 600 tons of barley, 100 tons of rice, 1,000 oxen and cows, 600 buffaloes, 300 horses, 1,000 donkeys, 50 mules, 700 camels, and 5,000 sheep.

General Description .—The route here described is not a made road; but in ordinary weather it is quite suitable for wheeled transport, and is u£ed daily for such. As far as stage 2 the road lies over level clay plains which are generally barren owing to lack of irrigation. In the winter large caravans of camels, and small ones of donkeys, are met with upon this road carry-Route No. 2%—contd. ing wheat and rice to Baghdad. The Baghdad-Hillah line cf telegraph, which is a double one, follows the alignment of the road pretty closely as far as stage 2. This route is the main line of communication between Persia and the holy places of the Shi’ahs. During the winter months this journey is ren dered uncomfortable by very cold winds from the north, often accompanied by clouds of dust. This is the main carriage road to Karbala and Najaf; it is passable for carriages as far as Musaiyib, where passengers cross the Euphrates on foot and take another carriage to Karbala and Najaf. Road unmetalled. Country irrigated, but not inundated, up to 10 miles. Whole country stoneless, brown soil', road, full of deep ruts, is a foot deep in dust in places, or in mud in wet weather, but for half the distance is good going, as when one road is worn too much, another is taken. Water .—Abundant from streams and canals. Fuel and Fodder .—There are date palms at intervals all along this route, but there are no bushes except shok, or thorny plants. Fodder is available at Mahmudlyah (stage 1), and Sikandarlyah and Musaiyib (stage 2). There is fair camel grazing all along the route.

About 500 yards outside Baghdad a brick bridge, with a ramp leading up to it, is crossed. Water sometimes collects on either side of this bridge in pools 1^ feet deep, which might possibly be an obstacle to guns but not to cavalry or infantry. From a short distance beyond this bridge to the Kharr bridge at mile 3 the road runs along the top of an embankment revetted with brushwood and pierced at intervalsRoute No. 23— contd. by brick culverts giving passage to floods that cross the line of the road here in wet weather. The top of the embankment is about 15 feet above the surrounding country, and where it leads on to the Kharr bridge it attains its maximum breadth, 45 feet. The ends of the bridge are 2 stone piers, 16 feet broad and 6 feet long, projecting from either bank; the central portion consists of a single iron girder 171 feet long, carrying a metalled ■roadway 9 feet wide. In April, when the water in the Kharr stream is 10 feet deep, the height of the roadway above the water is 12 feet. At the south end of the bridge, on the east side of the road, is a 2-storeyed brick house, behind which are about 20 mud huts. After crossing the Kharr bridge the road trends to the south, separating from the bridge embankments which continues west ward for about 2 miles and ends in the desert. Near mile 5 the road strikes a bend of the Tigris, but again immediately leaves it. At mile 6, Khan-al-Kharabah, a ruined caravansarai, is passed on the east of the road. Aboyt mile 10 there is marshy ground, sometimes dry, on both sides of the road. Beyond this as far as Mahmudiyah the country traversed is dry desert. At mile 13, there is another desert caravansarai, Khan Azad, on the west side of the road. As Mahmudiyah is entered the canal of the same name from the Euphrates is crossed; the canal is here 27 feet broad and 4 feet deep, and the bridge over it is 18 feet wide and has a «mall arch of 6 feet span in the middle. A little higher up the canal is only 10 feet broad. Mahmudiyah, an increasing town on the south bank of the canal of the same name, with 150 houses, a dozen shops, 11 khans, and about 1,000 souls. These khans are mostly defen sible, one of them being partly loopholed and provided with circular towers at the four corners; in the aggregate they would provide accommodation for about 1,000 men and the same number of animals. The canal flows for 8 or 9 months in the year, and irrigates •fields of wheat, barley and millet.217 the Ike lanknent where it breadth, road asd portid metaled .e Kiarr ae water i side of ibout 2d e south, es west- mile 5 ediatelj irai, is 7, on ah the Khan name ) broad Jhasa up the of tie ops, H defen- d with e fej id the r ligates Route No. 23— contd. 2 MUSAIYIB . . • 20.—S.S.W. At mile 5, Khan-al-Bir, a cara- 4 ^ vansarai, now de serted stands on the west side of the rqad. At mile 12, Sikandariyah village, 50 mud houses with a khan and several brick enclosures, on left bank of canal of same name. Cultivation being developed; grazing for considerable flocks and herds. Just beyond here, a canal from the Euphrates is crossed by a brick bridge. Between here and end of stage there is some times an extensive slough, known as Abu Lupah. The road strikes the left bank of the Euphrates immediate ly above Musaiyib town; about 50 yards before reaching the bank it crosses a deep canal by a high brick bridge of which the roadway is 10 feet wude. The approach to the town is along a broad embankment carefully revetted, which contains the river at this point. In the middle of Musaiyib town the Euphrates is_ crossed by a boat bridge of 24 pontoons, a rickety and ill-maintamed struc ture. Musaiyib, situated on both sides of the Euphrates, and shut in by palm trees; main part of the town on left bank, but some of the best buildings are on the right bank. Houses mostly of masonry: there are 12 khans, 25 granaries, and about 100 shops. On the left bank immediately above the town a strong em bankment carefully revetted extends for about 600 yards, on the top of which runs the Baghdad-Karbala road. Population, about 3,500 souls: there are 40,000 date palms, transport is not readily obtainable in any amount; forage ant? provisions limited; boats include about 12 safinahs and a scoio of sajahs. 3 KARBALA . . . 20.—W.S.W. The road for wheeled transport g 4 from here to Karbala skirts the northern edge of the cultivation dependent on the Husainiyah canal, at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from the218 Route No. 23—contd. canal; passes the tomb of ’Ann at mile 12 or 13; and finally enters Karbala by the Bab Baghdad bridge. An alternative route, for horsemen and foot passengers, follows more closely the north bank of the Husainiyab. At about mile 7, it crosses a medium-sized distributary from the Husainiyab, empty-and ruined; and immediately beyond this it runs over the Wall distributary by a brick bridge, 18 feet wide, with no parapet nor handrail. The banks of the Wall are 45 feet apart, 25 feet high, and precipitous; and the stream at the bottom flows 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep. A short dis tance beyond the Wall the road crosses the Hamudiyah distri butary, which has banks 25 feet apart and 16 feet high. The bridge here is of brick, with an 8-foot roadway. At about mile 11, another distributary, known as the Abu Sulaiman, narrower than the preceding ones, and spanned by a bridge of wood and earth. About mile 12, Khan-al-’Ataishi. To mile 17, route runs along right bank of the Husainiyah, and a number of small canals are passed, the bridges over which are bad and unfit for •wheels. The road now crosses to the left bank of the Husainiyah by the Gul-i-Safid. For these last several miles the way has lain through dense date planta tions. From mile 17 to end of stage there are continuous walled enclosures adjoining the road on both sides. Karbala is a town of about 50,000 permanent inhabitants and has in addition a large floating population. The old town is surrounded on three sides by a wall from 20 to 30 feet high, with towers at intervals, but the work is in bad repair. There are two tiers of loopholes; perimeter of wall, about 2 miles; 5 gates. Large agricultural and garden produce, considerable quantities of dates. Large and well-stocked bazar, and some 20 shops dealing in European wares. Karbala not a good centre for collection of supplies or transport. No mules; and camels only procurable in the autumn when the Bedouins come in. There is a flour-mill driven by an oil-engine; 2 ice making plants Water from Husainiyah canal, or when it is dry, from 20 to 25 wells sunk mostly in the canal bed.219 od finally sssengers, iyah.

From Fallujah 67 the road practically follows the river all day, running, as far as mile 12, between it and a low, flat-topped range of hills, from 50 to 80 feet high, and then the hills come down to the river and the road runs on through level country until 1 hour from Rumadiyah, when a low hill, about 1J miles long, west of the road and at right angles to it, is passed. This hill commands the Fallujah- Rumadiyah road. Cultivation all the way to Rumadiyah along the river bank. Saw about 100 horses near Fallujah and about 1,500 sheep on the road. Many fallahin living along the river- bank. At mile 30, Rumadiyah: a small town rather large than Fallujah. There is a Mudir here.

The chief route from Baghdad to the north is by Du jail, Harbah, and Samarrah to Tikrlt, 104 miles; while the mam route to the north-west passes by Abu Ghuraib, Fallujah, Ruma- diyah, and Hit, and reaches, ’Anah at 216 miles. The Tikrit route follows the Tigris, and the ’Anah route to the Euphrates line. Forty days is about the time taken by a laden caravan to reach the Mediterranean from Baghdad. The old postal route between Damascus and Baghdad lies in an almost direct line across the shot, or desert, and crosses the Euphrates at Fallujah. It is over 500 miles in length, and the journey occupies about t 10 days. The camel post now travels via Aleppo.Route No. 26. NOTES ON ROUTES NORTH, EAST AND WEST OF BAGHDAD. (Summarised from Route Books). General Description. A line taken from Kirkuk through Khaniqin to Bagh-i Shahi roughly demarcates the mountains from the low lying country. In the former, movement is practically confined to the mountain roads, and throughout the winter and spring all operations are difficult owing to snow and to the mountain torrents. The low-lying country is liable to be rendered practically impassable by floods from April to June, and by heavy rain in December and January. 1. Musal to Baghdad. A. By road along the right bank of the Tigris (Tigris Valley No. 107). Distance .—230 miles. The route report states that the road in 1903 was unfit for wheeled traffic. Mr. A; W. Tod, however, says that it is now better than the road via Kirkuk (vide B below), and is quite practicable^ by motor cars. But there are practically no supplies to be obtained, and water is scarce as the road does not follow the river closely. In 1915, however, it was reported on the authority of Shaikh Hajji ’Abbas of Kut that there were wells •even shown to be a plentiful supply of water. B. By road via Arbil—Kirkuk (107 miles)—Kifri (177 miles). (Tigris Valley No. 104). Distance .—294 miles, in 15 stages. Crosses the Great Zab by a ferry. Fit for all arms at all seasons, although, in winter, marching is sometimes impeded by snow. The district through which road passes is very rich ja supplies, and water is plentiful. C. By raft to Samarrah, thence by rail. Each raft carries about 100 men. Journey by raft takes about six days.226 Route No. 26 — contd. From Samarrah to Baghdad is 74 miles. This is the usual route followed by Turkish reinforcements which march to Musal or Jazirah from railhead at Ras-ul- Am. 2. Aleppo—Euphrates Valley—Fallujah Baghdad. 538 miles in 40 stages. This route is practicable for wheeled traffic (including motor cars) throughout. It follows the right bank of the Euphrates 4 from Meskine to Fallujah, where it crosses the river by a boat bridge, and runs due east to Baghdad. Supplies and water plentiful.’ From Meskine to Fallujah the journey may be made by boat, each carrying about 25 men. The river journey takes from 9 to 18 days, and the total time would therefore be from 21 to 30 days. This route has up to date only twice been used, by small parties of Turkish reinforcements. 3. Baghdad — Khaniqin — Kirmanshah. (Persia, Vol. Ill, Part 2, No. 54; old edition, Vol. Ill, No. 96). Distance. —222 miles in 15 stages. Passable by all arms in all seasons, except for the Ba qubah boat bridge, which is too weak for wheeled artillery, and for short sections of road near Qasr-i-Shirin, Karind and Harunabad. (These points have probably been already improved). In the flood season and in wet weather the road between Baghdad and Khaniqin becomes very heavy and in places practically impassable by wheels. Supplies and water plentiful. 4. Baghdad — Mandali — Kirmanshah. (Persia, Vol. Ill, Part 2, No. 53; old edition, Vol. HI, No. 95). 217 miles in 14 stages. In the dry season all arms could get as far as Balad Ruz, and camels could reach Mandali. From Mandali to Khorasa- &lt; bad (Khosruabad) the route lies through mountainous and rocky country and the going is bad. In the flood season orRoute No. 26— contd. after heavy rain, the road up to Mandali becomes practically impassable even by mule transport. Up to Mandali (73 miles), and between Khoraiabad and Kirmanshah, supplies are plentiful. Between Mandali and Khorasabad practically no supplies are obtainable. Water is fairly abundant. 5. Kut-al-Amarah — Kirmanshah. (Persia, Vol. Ill, Part 2, No. 46, old edition, Vol. Ill, No. 94). 201 miles in 14 stages. In the dry season no water is found till Jassan is reached at mile 41. The road is passable by all arms up to 14 miles beyond Badrah. From here there is a succession of very difficult defiles and passes, passable only by mule transport. In the flood season the road between Kut and Jassan becomes impassable by wheeled transport and difficult for pack transport. In the spring when the rivers are in flood, the road beyond Badrah is closed in several places. Supplies are scarce; water is fairly plentiful, but is brackish. 6. Kirkuk — Sinneh — Kirmanshah. (Tigris Valley, No. 106, and Persia, Vol. II, Nos. 85 and 78). Distance. —298 miles in 16 stages. Up to Sulaimanieh the road is passable by all arms. From Sulaimanieh to Sinneh there is a fair mule track. The route is difficult in winter owing to snow. From Sinneh to Kirmanshah there is a camel track which could, without much difficulty, be made practicable for wheeled artillery. Supplies and water are fairly plentiful. 7. Sulaimanieh to Kirmanshah. (Persia, Vol. II, No. 77). 161 miles in 9 stages. In places, practically impassable by laden mules. Supplies and water are fairly plentiful. 8. Kifri to Qasr-i-Shirin.

Dobbs r Esq., C.I.E., Lieutenant Cbristian; Arab reports. 1 General. —The difficulties of all these routes are the same, viz .:— (a) Large extent of waterless desert. (b) Absence of landmarks or any definite tracks rendering the march of a column in waterless country dependent on guides and on compass bearings and distances taken off maps of questionable accuracy. (c) Marsh near the right bank of the Tigris in the wet season probably rendering all routes impassable. As a result of the reports of agents sent out for the pur pose, it transpires that there is no land route worthy of con sideration downstream of Kumait. Special attention has been devoted by agents to finding a possible through water route. In every case, however, it has been found necessary to go down to' the Hammar Lake and up the Bada’ah. 2. Water is from the Tigris right bank inundation and from wells in the Dujailah area. The best points on the Tigris from which to cross this innun- dation area in dry season (it is doubtful whether any of these routes would be passable in the wet season) are : (i) ’Ali Gharbi. (ft) Kumait.The best routes are: — A. ’Ali Gharbi to Hai. B. ’Ali Gharbi to Qal’at Sikkar. C. Kumait to Qal’at Sikkar. D. Kumait to Karadi. E. Hai to Kuma ; t. Of these A appears practicable for dismounted troops, B for mounted troops with slightly loaded mules or pony transport, and C, D. and E. for mounted troops without transport. A. ’Ali Oharbi to Hai. Reported by agents to be the best route between Tigris and Hai from the point of view of water. In the dry season it is passable for all arms; the three dry canals crossed just before reaching Hai would require ramping. In the wet season the Hor Saniyah would not be passable. Three stages:— (1) Ali Gharbi to Hassan Abu Tarabah Wells on the Dujailah about . 21 miles. (2) Thence to Bujaiya—(or otherwise) about *..... 11 „ (3) Thence to Hai about 12 „ Total 44 ,, Stage 1 .—Road runs from Ali Gharbi, via the Hirdabah Wells, the Sahul Wells, Abu Kafurah (which is a nishan only) and Hassan Abu Tarabah. The Abu Fazl Wells are situated about a mile to the N. W. of tjbe road at the 8th mile from Ali Gharbi. Between Hirdabah and Abu Kafurah the Hor Saniyah is crossed. This Hor is impassable during floods. Water .—As far as Hirdabah there is none. At Hirdabah there are numerous pools and wells. The water of the .pools has a good deal of deposit in it and is full of water flea^, butRoute No. 27 — contd. it is palatable and not brackish; fit for drinking if boiled or chlorinated; the water of the wells is clear and neither brackish nor sulphurous; fit for drinking if chlorinated. The next water found is at Sahul, it is _ muddy but not brackish or sulphurous; fit for drinking if chlorinated. At Hassan Abu Tarabah water is obtainable by digging in the bed of the Dujailah. Grazing and Supplies .—From Hirdabah onwards to the end of the stage grazing is good and sheep are plentiful. Stage 2 .—From Hassan Abu Tarabah there are 3 possible Routes. • (a) To Bujaiyar. (b) Direct to Maraibah. (c) To Qalat Abd and Maddinah. Of these (a) is the best provided the pool of water located at Bujaiyar in May and September, 1916, is still in existence. This pool, on above dates was 200 yards broad, 3 feet deep and contained good water. (b) From Hassan Abu Tarabah to Maraibah Wells where the first water is found entails a march of 17 miles. (c) Water is obtainable by digging at Madainah a march of 12 miles from Hassan Abu Tarabah. Stage 3 :— (a) Bujaiyar to Hai via Maraibah . . 12 miles. (b) Maraibah to Hai * . . .7 ,. (c) Madainah to Hai 12 ,, Two big nullahs have to be crossed in this stage. B. ’Ali Gharbi to Qal’at Sikkar. Arab estimate of distance 65 miles. Stages. 1. ’Ali Gharbi to the Dujailah half way.

Kumait to Karadi. Arab estimate of distance 75 miles. Similar to C. E. Kumait to Hai. (Authority 1st part of (a) Captain Barrett, Ali Gharbi, remainder Arab reports.) 2 Routes— (a) by N. bank of Dujailah. (b) by S. bank of Dujailah. Distance in each case about 50-55 miles. (a) By N.

Water .—Can always be obtained from the Dujailah up as far as Siderat, where it ends abruptly, and where on Septem ber 1st, 1916, it was reported waist deep and plentiful. 1 he next water that can be obtained is in the bed of the Hor Umm Gataibah. Grazing .—Is good as far as Sadraniyah, non-existent in the next stretch but good at Hor Umm Gataibah where sheep are generally plentiful. The route follows (a) as far as the Dujailah Ford where it takes the south bank instead of crossing. _ Cross the Ched- diyah which is a branch of the Dujailah. This is 20 feet wide with a muddy bottom impassable for wheels. Two miles fur- ther on is the Nahr Fitnah, 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep, with 3 feet of water. From here to Sadraniyah there are several small irrigation channels but no obstacle. The grazing is good and sheep are fairly plentiful throughout. From here the route is the same as (a). The direct route Saniyah to Hai via Hachaima wells is over very broken ground and impracticable for wheels.

(a) Via Gussab’s Fort, 2 stages: — (1) Dujailah Redoubt Gussab’s Fort . 12 miles. (2) Gussab’s Fort to Hai . . .15 ,, The only obstacles on this route are the Shib Gussab Canal 30 feet wide, the Yadhub (20 feet wide (?) ) which runs from the Shatt-el-Gharraf to the Hor A1 Maraibah and perhaps three other dry canals just north of Hai. The crossing of the Yadhub is marshy and very difficult, but a better crossing may be found by making a detour and crossing the canal at a point a mile further east. Between the Yadhub and Hai are many 3 foot irrigation channels which would require ramping; if this were done the route would be passable throughout for all arms and probably motor transport, in the dry season. The crossing of the Shib Gussab is easy. Water .—Up to Shib Gussab Canal none. At Gussab’s Fort water is obtained from the Canal in the wet season, and from wells in the dry season. These wells are ordinarily dis used and the water contains a slight deposit but is not brackish; it could be rendered drinkable. Water can also be obtained at 4 feet by digging anywhere. The water from the wells in the Yadhub tastes good and could be rendered drinkable by chlorination. The water from the wells in the centre of Hor A1 Maraibah (Khor ad Dozah) is like that at Gussab’s Fort. Grazing .—As far as Gussab’s Fort there is none; at Gussab’s Fort it is poor; from there onwards it is fair. Supplies .—Some sheep would probably be found where there is grazing in the 2nd stage.

Following is Arab information lately collected (Force “D” Intelligence summary No. 60) regarding cross routes from Tigris to Pusht-i-Kuh. (a) Bagh-i-Shahi to Changulak 15 miles. Passable all arms. Plentiful water. (b) ’Ali Gbarbi to Pai Takht 28 miles. Track through hills suitable for pack only. No water in the plain but plentiful in the hills. (c) ’Ali Gharbi to Kumait 26 miles. Passable all arms. Plentiful water at Dahela midway. Plentiful also at Kumait in the Tib river, but very bad and brackish. 100 men could get supplies for a few days at Kumait. By pushing up into the hills from Kumait better water becomes available from tributary streams. (d) Mudalil to Kumait via Dehlman 35 miles. Passable for light wheels but no water, en route. Notes on route from Badrah to Kumait linking up the north ern ends of. routes mentioned in preceding paragraph. Three miles passable for all arms but the portion from Dehluran to Kumait would need a little preparation. Water plentiful but supplies very scanty. A few hundred maunds of flour altogether along the route, and very little more barley except when the crops are on the threshing floor. The Tribes emigrate in April to the Siah Kuh and take with them their food-stufis and cattle, leaving only a few men for the harvesting. Grain is then taken* away to a few villages such as Dehluran and to nomad camps. Pusht-i-Kuh is a poor country and grain has to be imported from Badrah and Zorbatiyeh and Dizful. The conclusion is that supplies would have to be collected before a force of any size could utilise the Dehluran Valley route.r 236 Route No. 29. ROUTES IN PUSHT-I-KUH.

(At Gulgul excellent supply from a series of large springs forming a rapid stream 15^ wide and knee deep cleai cold water.) Many streams are passed en route. In the hills the water is, as a rule, very good; it is only in the lower reaches that it becomes brackish as the streams then contain much saline matter.

W. by S. ig For the first ten miles, to the village of Jibar, the road* lies across open plain,4 ; ....V -' W v . 240 Route No. 30— contd. crossing numerous irrigation channels by brick culverts. Road good but not suitable for wheeled transport on account of narrow culverts. From Jibar the road descends to low ground forming the bed of the Diz river, and passes through a swampy tract across numerous streams and water cuts by flimsy wooden bridges. Track often difficult to find. At mile 13 Saiyid Mohammad ford on the Diz is reached. The village of Saiyid Mohammad 4 is on the right bank of the Diz. The ford at low water is about 300 yards across and 2 feet deep. Current not swift, approaches easy and bottom firm sand. In spring and after heavy rain this ford does not exist. No kelleks or boats; these must be obtained from Dizful. From Saiyid Mohammad to Shush (6 miles) the track lies over open country, crossing several irrigation channels. Road good except after rain. Supplies at Shush. Bhoosa about 1,000 “ shalifs ” (i.e., large sacks). Wood and milk plentiful. Barley in small quantities only. Good drinking water from the Shavur stream. Stored in the cattle of Shush are all materials for 1 mile of light railway (Deceauville). Also 1,000 picks and 1,000 shovels. 2 KHEZAR . . . 16.—General direction of ^ stage S. W. Cross 35 the Shavur stream at Shush. Stream 50 yards broad, several easy fords. Reach Kharkeh river almost due west at 2 miles. Cross by ford, 400 yards broad and 2 feet deep at low water. Approach on left bank is through thick tree jungle. Bottom firm sand and pebbles. This ford can be crossed by laden mules at low water, but does not exist in spring or after heavy rain. Only one kellek obtainable from Shush. From the right bank of the Kharkeh the road takes a southerly course for 3 miles, keeping parallel with and close to the river, and then turns S. W. across open rolling downs. The track is difficult to find here and a guide is necessary. At mile 7 cross Abu Salabekh nullah which holds water ' in the spring only. At 11 miles cross Ghashab nullah. This always holds water, which is, however, rather brackish.Route No. 30 — contd. The ground is marshy from mile 10|- as far as Khezar, which is only a grazing ground for camels. There is no village and supplies are not procurable. Water is obtained from numerous wells (about 30 in all). The water is found about 6 feet from the surface and there would be no difficulty in sinking more wells if necessary. There are no appliances for drawing water. The road on this stage is practicable for all arms but ramping: of Ghashab Nullah would be necessary for wheels. Grazing for horses, etc., can be obtained near Khezar (even in January) from patches of “ dhub ” grass. 3 SHATT AL AGHAL . 18.—General direction of stage W. by S. 53 First 6 miles across an open plain to a pass through the Mushtak (Abu-Zarub) hills which run roughly N.W. by S.E.. the road here crosses a few sand hills. The rise is very slight and gradual but a mile to either side of the track the Mush tak hills rise to about 400 feet and are much broken in places- About one mile due south of the track against the western slopes of the hills is a well and spring named Umm al Hayal, giving drinkable though slightly brackish water. At mile 8 the track crosses a nullah, which forms no obstacle. The track runs alongside the nullah for about mile. At mile 9 two large pools of rain water are passed close to the track and to the south of it. These pools are called Ubliloot. Here a tract of low sand hills is reached which extends to Shatt al Aghal. At this latter place there are three wells containing good drinking water, similar to those at Khezar. There are no villages or supplies on this march. The road is suitable for all arms but the going in the sandy tract would be heavy for field guns and wheeled transport. 4 MARKAZ . . . 28.—General direction of stage W. up to mile 5£ 81 from W. S. W. up to mile 12J, from here S. W. by S. up to mile 19 and hence S. by E. Up to mile 5^ the track runs over open, undulating plain. (From this point the Jabal-Fakka hills near 300 degrees.) The ground then drops to a lower -level and traverses a flat242 Route No. 30— contd. plain which is covered with tamarisk jungle tor the first 3 miles and thence is quite bare. There are occasional small nullahs and water cuts. At mile 19 the Duwairij river is reached. Cross by ford. The whole breadth from bank to bank is nearly one mile, mostly shallow swamp with firm but very uneven bottom, making it difficult for laden mules to cross. The actual stream is near the right (south) bank and here the water deepens, and in January, 1916 was 4^ feet, in consequence of late heavy rain. It is reported to be considerably shallower at low water. As far as the Duwairij this march is practicable for all arms, but slight ramping of the nullah banks would be necessary for wheels. The crossing of the Duwairij swamp and stream would be practicable for all arms at low water, but difficult for wheels on account of the uneven nature of the bed. Through out this march the track is difficult to follow and a guide is necessary. 5 ’AMARAH . . . 20.—General direction of stage due W. parallel 101 to a large swamp to the north and the Shatt-al-Arz canal to the south, and occasionally approaching quite close to each. Two small canals connecting the Shatt-al-Arz with the swamp have to be crossed, but both are easily fordable. A slight ramping of their banks would be necessary for wheels. The whole of this tract is very low lying and liable to serious floods in Spring. At other times of the year this stage is practic able for all arms. ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. (A) Stage 1 .—There is an alternative route from Dizful to Shush through Sagwand country wd Dubinda (5 miles) on right bank of the Bala Rud and Seyed Ahmad. The total distance is 18 miles. Cross the Diz by ford one mile below the town. The Bala Rud is a stream with a broad bed but very little water even during the Spring. It is seldom unfordable.

I Note. —It must be clearly understood that the depths of water and the extent of floods are constantly changing. The Nahr Mudailil has a width at its head of about 50 yards with a depth of 31'. , . , The Nahr Kharash takes off to the S. E. at a few hundred yards from the head of the Mudailil Canal, and is now dry. Its bed, at the take off, is about 1' above the present level of the water in the Mudailil Canal. . At mile 2 of the Mudailil Canal, the Nahr Dujailah takes off to the West water from it is now flowing into the NahrRoute ISTo. 32 — contd. Mudailil, which has a depth downstream (South) of junction of 3+' and of S' upstream (North) of it. From the Dujailah Junction downstream (South), the Mudailil Canal is known as the A1 Bushut and has a depth at Bait Mutushar (at mile 3) of 5 feet, with a width of SO yards. Early in August the Nahr Mudailil and Nahr al Bushut become dry, and water is obtained by digging wells in their beds. The Nahr Dujailah, owing to its greater depth contains water for some time longer, and occasionally throughout the vear. At Bait Sahar, mile the Al Bushut has a width of about 50 yards and a depth of' 5'. At mile 4^ the depth increases to 7' with a width of 80 yards. At mile 64 - the channel decreases to a width of 30 yards with a depth of 4'. There is a prominent mound here, with a ruin on top, at a distance of ^ of a mile East of the Canal called Chidiyah; and a reed hut village on the river bank. From mile 64 to 8, where the Nahr Al Bushut enters the swamp the stream gradually widens and shallows, until at the mouth it is so shallow that Mashoofs have to be dragged by hand through about 4' of water. The district on the East Bank of this section is called Chidiyah, and is a millet and rice tract about 6' above present water level. The district on the West Bank is a low sandy flat, just above water level, and heavily planted with millet. This dis trict is called Buraidiyah. At the Al Bushut mouth, the Khor Buraidiyah has a width of open water of 54 miles. From Bait Sahar mounted men are said to be able to cross the swamp from the right bank of the Al Bushut to the desert. The width of open water to be crossed appears to be about: 1 mile and the depth not more than 2 feet. From the junction of the Al Bushut with the Buraidiyah Swamp to Hamar Island is a distance of 3 miles. This section253 unction ), tie depth rards.

No camps were seen on the Eastern shore, and the Western shore was out of sight. On El Hamfir Island is a reddish mound about 12' h probably an old fort. From El Hamar to Abu Zanazir Island is a distance of 1£ miles. ' The depth of water between the islands is feet, and the width of the swamp 9 miles. This section of swamp is called Khor Abu Zanazir. Between Abu Zanazir Island, which is a prominent mound about 15' high, and a reed patch to the south of it, is a channel containing a few inches of water leading into the Khor el ’Aliyah. From Abu Zanazir to Hafaniyah on the Eastern edge of the El ’Aliyah Swamp is 3 miles. Half way between these points, the swamp contracts from a width of 9 miles at Abu Zanazir to a width of H miles. From this point to Hafaniyah is a mass of reed patches, with channels running through them with a depth of 4' to 5' and having a considerable current flowing south. At Hafaniyah the width of the Khor is | of a mile. Men were seen here crossing the swamp to the west side, the greatest depth being about 3'. Opposite Hafaniyah is a large mound known as Tell ’Aliyah some 30' high. The Nahr Hafaniyah, which joins the swamp here is 20 yards wide and 4' deep. Its head on the Tigris is now silted up, and never takes Tigris water even in flood time. The district on either side of it is said to be a rich grain area. One and a half miles S. of Hafaniyah the Khor narrows to a width of about | of a mile being almost cut in two by a l254 Route No. 32— contd. projecting tongue of land from the west shore carrying a long mound known as Tell Tuwailah about 15' high. The depth of water in this channel which is called Khor Tuwailah is feet. From Tell Tuwailah to A1 Hamdi, a distance of 3|- miles, the swamp is known as Umm A1 Hosh. Its depth is 3' near the centre shoaling gradually to either side, and its width If miles. The district on the west edge of this swamp is called Lufaifah. A good deal of grain is said to be grown in depressions in the desert to the west of the Umm A1 Hosh. The district to the east of the Umm A1 Hosh is under the jurisdiction of Shiai, a relative of Shaikh Mutashar of the A1 Bu Darraj who has a large number of reed huts over this area. El Hamdi is a tongue of land jutting out from the eastern shore. It is under water in flood time, and is uncultivated. A canal 4' wide and at present 4' deep crosses it, but is only navigable for light Mashoofs when dragged by hand. The Khor A1 Haimah'stretches from El Hamdi to El Hamish. This swamp is about 4 miles Ions' from E. to W. and 14 to 3 miles wide from N. to S. It is reported to be at present some 3' deep in the centre, where a lake is formed in August, when the rest of the swamp is dry. On the eastern shore of the Khor A1 Daimah near Hamdi peninsula is a mound about 8' high called ’Awali. with a smaller mound close to it, and covered with loose bricks called El Kowli. Except for a few Arab tents and a dozen or so cattle near the mounds, there were no supplies apparent. All this line of swamps empty into the Khor Butairah, through the Khor Em El Buqar which stretches from El Hamish to the mouth of the Nahr El Khar, a distance of 4 miles in length with a width of 3 miles. It has a depth in its centre of 9' and Arabs in Mashoofs will not cross it if there is any breeze, owing to the heavy sea which gets up in a few minutes. There are large numbers of cattle and sheep on its northern shore, and on the area lately under water is a heavy crop of millet. The Sufaihah and the Zigatah Canals flow into the northern waters of the Um El Buqar. Both canals are very shoal at their mouths.255 dug a long led Khor miles, 5 S' neat nddtli If is called sions in nder {he 'the A1 i area, eastern tinted. is only amish.

The Sufaihah Canal, one mile inland from the Khor, has a width of 10 yards and a depth of 4/. Early in August the swamp area from Mudailil-Buqar becomes dry, except for occasional pools as that in the centre of the Khor A1 Daimah. By the end of August this whole swamp area is dry and hard, and fit for all arms. The tribes who are now camped on the western edge of the marsh then dig wells in the dry bed of the Khor. The water from these wells is said to be good and sweet. The Um El Buqar, owing to the supply of water it receives from the Nahr Butairah, through its branch, the Nahr-El- Khar never goes dry. The Nahr-El-Khar leaves the Butairah one mile from the head of the latter on the Tigris and flows S. W. into the Um-El- Buqar at a distance of miles after leaving Butairah. Most of this area is planted with millet and melons. At the junction with the Butairah, the Nahr-El-Khar has a depth of 6' with a width of 60'. At 1 mile from the junction, the depth decreases to 3', while at its tail into the swamp the depth is 2', the width remaining practically the same. From the N. W. limits of the swamps above noted across the desert to Hai Town, a distance of about 45 miles, there is now no other water. The pools and water holes which existed on this line a month ago are now said to be dry (Water could be probably obtained by digging in the bed of the Khor Umm Gataibah, about 10 miles short of Hai Town).

It must be clearly understood that the depths of water and the extent of floods are constantly changing. The Butairah is easily navigable for launches for the first ■seven miles. At this point the stream is broken up by several256 Route No. 33 — contd. islands. Navigation here would be somewhat hampered by the strength of the current in getting round these islands. Local Arabs state there is a bar here, but soundings shewed nowhere less than 6| feet of water. Soundings in the Butairah showed, at its head 10 feet, increasing to 14 feet at miles, and decreasing onwards to 7 feet above the islands at mile 7. At mile 7 the Nahr Abu Sabah takes off from the left bank, flowing nearly due south through Abu Sabah Village and enters a swamp at a distance of 3 miles from its head. It traverses a rich grain country which is protected from the Butairah floods by a bund, wdiich was washed away in places during the late floods and has not been repaired. The Butairah, from the Islands downwards is known as the Nahr Shukairiyat. 34 miles down-stream from the islands, i.e., at mile 104, a channel 300 feet wude and 7 feet deep leads from the Shukair iyat into the swamp to the west. The swamp at this point is 14 miles wide, with a depth about half way across of 4 feet. A bar of 14 feet of water was found at this outlet to the swamp, but a more detailed survey would probably discover a 4 feet channel leading through the Bar. At mile 104 the main channel has a width of about, 400 feet, and a depth of 74 feet, and is easily navigable. At mile 14 the Shukairiyat enters the Butairah swamp, being separated from the swamp between mile 104 and mile 14 by a low sandy island. The depth of the channel decreases rapidly on this section, being 6 feet deep at mile 104 and 2 feet deep at its tail. The width of the swamp at this outlet is 3 miles, and is open water, free from weeds.. From the tail of the channel at its outlet into the Khor the current sweeps along the E. edge of the swamp to B^b-El- Hawa the depth found varying between 6 feet and 3 feet.257 Route No. 33— contd. wel V ids, 10 feet, wards to ?ft bant, age and sd from my in as the ■e 10|, lutair- depth x) the .seover ut, 400 swamp, id mile 3 section, is, and is the Bor to Bstb-El- ?et. At Umm Chir, miles south of the Butairah outlet, into the swamp, the XJmm Ohir canal takes oh from the left bank of the swamp, and flows in an easterly direction for 1| miles, when it empties into the Khor Abu Sabah, which is fed by the Nahr Sabah from the north. The Umm Chir has a width of about 30 feet, and a depth of 4£ feet, and waters a very rich tract known as Ra-Ash, lying between the Khor Butairah and Khor Abu Sabah. The approach to the Umm Chir Canal mouth from the deep water in the swamp is very shoal, for about half a mile only 1 foot of water was found. In low water Mashoofs have to be dragged over, the mud by hand. There is a good sized village at its mouth, with flocks of buffaloes, cattle and sheep. From Umm Chir to Bab-El-Hawa, a distance of 2 miles, there is a depth of water of 4 feet, and a width of swamp of miles. The Bab-El-Hawa is a fine canal, about 60 feet wide, and 9 feet deep throughout, except at its easterly end, where is a bar with only 2 feet of water. Its length is 1| miles, and it carries a strong current flowing eastwards into the smaller easterly swamp. On both banks of the Bab-El-Hawa, which is the boundary between Shaikhs Salman and Shawai, barley is said to be grown. The Butairah swamp is said to be fuller than usual this year, and in consequence large rich tracts on its western shore have not been sown, owing to the depth of water. In low water the Butairah swamp becomes a marshy tract intersected by streams and lakes. The island of Haddam practically divides the swamp area into two sections, the top or northerly area is known as Kbor Butairah and the lower or southerly as Khor Tafrah. The Khor Tafrah in low water becomes like the Butairah Marsh, an area covered with water channels, lakes and islands; much rice is grown in this area, especially on the o. W. snore. This year owing to the exceptional amount of water, no rice has been planted.258 Route No. 33— contd. Many reed villages are' situated on the edge of the swamp and buffaloes, cattle and sheep appeared plentiful. The Tabar canal (or Majar Saghir) at Bait Salman (east of Khor Abu Sabah) is 70 feet wide and 4£ feet deep. It is kept up to this level, which equals ground level, by a judi cious bunding of the irrigation channels downstream. From Bait Salman downstream (South) the Tabar Canal is called the Nahr Bahamiyah, and is ab^out 2 feet deep. It flows along the ridge of high ground and waters a very rich tract of rice land about 2£ miles wide, draining into swamps on either side through artificial channels. Many of these irrigation channels are 6 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, and can take Mashoof traffic between the Khor Abu Sabah and the Majar Kabir. The Nahr Tabar from Shaikh Salman to the Tigris is on an average 70 feet wide with a depth of not less than 6 feet, except in the village of Shaikh Salman, where it is 4^- feet deep. Route No. 34.

The soil is clay and fn many places swampy; date plantations occur here and there. At mile 1 the road becomes a mere track across the mud fiat. The country is barren to the north but a belt of cultivation fringes the Karun. At mile 2i the route lies over country which becomes a vast swamp in the spring rams. At mile 41- a small village and date plantation about 1 mile to the rignt. The going after rain is heavy and swampy. At mile * a small village of reed and straw huts is passed. It is situated on the left bank of a muddy creek, about 50 yards wide by three feet deep, which frequently presents considerable diffi culty in fording. There is usually a site for a camp three miles further on, opposite Dair Island but the actual site depen s on the state of inundation and the state of the river with refer ence to a ’suitable place for bringing barges alongside. Graz ing for camels is available but for no other animals. Generally speaking this route is rendered impassable during se ®; son but when the Karun river alone is in flood and not the bhatt-al- ’Arab as well, it is sometimes possible to find a land route by making a wide circuit inland starting in a northerly direction, passing 2 miles from the village of Manduwan and then pro ceeding east and joining the river upstream of Qisbeh Greek. This route, however, would not be passable for wheels y reason of the narrowness of the roadway of two bridges over small canals between Muhammareh and Manduwan. This adds over 4 miles to the distance of the stage. This was the route which it was proposed the 23rd Cavalry follow on the 20th May, 1915; when, however, the bhatt-al-Route No. 34— contd . ’Arab also rose, this route, too, became impassable and the regiment was conveyed from Muhammareh to near Salmaneh by boat. 2 ADHRAT ISLAND . 16.—General direction of Stage North to mile 26 10, then North-east. From here the route is passkble for all arms and a motor could do the march at slow speed. The going is soft with treacher ous boggy spots. There is a good site for a camp opposite Adhrat Island with a convenient place for barges on the Karun to come alongside. There is a good camel grazing and scanty grazing for horses 1£ miles west of the camp. 3 SAB’EH . . . 16.—Compass bearing of the Stage is 360 42 degrees. The route is passable for all arms and a motor car could do the march at slow speed. There is no sign of a road and the “ going ” is on the soft side with treacherous boggy spots. At mile 2 Rehvali is passed on the right. There are a few pools of w r ater in the bed of the Hammamiyah at mile 7^-, and in the ’Aon mile 12 there is good water for horses but too muddy for men. These two and the other water cuts met with are quite minor obstacles. Shortly niter passing the ’Aon the tomb of Saiyd Abud comes in sight and forms a con spicuous landmark, and from mile 15^-, 2 miles before the tomb is passed, the date trees of Sab’eh can be seen. If this stage is considered too long, a halt may be made opposite Adhrat Island, where there is scanty grazing for horses miles west of camp and good camel grazing. Note .—Alternative intermediate stage Adhrat. There is a convenient site for barges on the Karun to come alongside at this point. This divides the stage into two stages of 9 and 15 miles respectively, the extra distance being due to following the river in the first of these stages. The village of Sab’eh is merely a miserable collection of huts. There is a convenient site on the Karun for barges to come alongside. Tamarisk bushes grow freely and form an abundance of fuel. The plain in the vicinity is more or less cultivated, and a limited quantity of “ khasil ” is- available in season; there is also fair grazing,261 3le and fte r Salmanet irection of 2 to mile N’ortkeast, wtor could t freaclier- opposite ihe Karun nd scantj iring of is 360 'uld do and tie ' spots, a few and ut too 3 met the acon- e tomh i stage yhrat ies west aeie is a ngside at 9 and 15 following of Sab’eh convenient Tamarisl Route No. 3 A — concld . for horses in the vicinity, a sweet smelling variety of grass, known in Persian as “ Gul-i-Zard, ” being found in some abund ance also good camel grazing.

The track traverses level country and is pass able for cavalry, infantry and light field artillery and for A. T. carts. Light Fiat carts can be taken over the whole road in pairs. They should not be taken singly as the road is soft in parts (either by reason of mud or of sand) and cars have occasionally to drag one another out of difficulties. The road is quite im passable for heavy Peerless and Napier cars. The impassable places are such that it is impossible to avoid them by making a detour. In the flood season or after heavy rain the whole of the first two stages become impassable for wheeled transport and very difficult for pack transport. After Stage two the road for motors branches off and leaves Salmaneh Island well to the East and goes straight for a point 3 or 4 miles West of Rehvali. From a point 3 miles E. N. E. of Manduwan there is a stretch of about 7 miles suitable for heavy lorries, otherwise the ground will only carry light carts and arrangements for rescuing even these are necessary.

Water .—In the first stage, water is abundant but is slightly brackish. In the remaining stages, good and plentiful water can be obtained from the Karun river. Supplies .—None w T orth considering, except on reaching the vicinity of Ahwaz. Grazing and Fuel .—In February, March and April there is fair grazing for horses, except in the first two stages, but during the remainder of the year there is none. Where horse grazing is mentioned in this report, it is to be understood as referring only to the Spring months. Camel grazing and scrub fuel are, throughout most of the stages, fairly abundant. Camping Grounds .—Unlimited space is available, except at the 1st stage, where there is only room for one Infantry Divi sion or one Cavalry Brigade. The first camping ground is under water in the flood season or after heavy rain. Communications .—A telegraph line runs from Muham- mareh along the right bank of the Karun river to Dair Island, where it crosses the river and follows the left bank to Bandar Nasiri and Ahwaz. If river transport other than steamer is used, the length of the marches and the positions of camping grounds depend on the rate at which the boats can move, which with a head wind is very slow. The total distance by river is 138 miles, of which Basrah to Salmaneh Island is 36 miles. The banks of the Karun river are firm and mehelas can moor alongside. The Karun is at its lowest from the middle of October to the end of November and during this period steamers of 3£ feet draft sometimes have difficulty in navigating the difficult 20 miles reach below Ahwaz. The river is tidal up to Ismaili in the 5th stage, but sea water never reaches it. Climate .—The floods on the Shatt-al-’Arab begin to rise in March. They obtain their maximum about May 1st, and remain high throughout April, May and June, when they begin to subside. The Karun river is at its highest in March and April when the riverside tracts are liable to flood.264 Route No. 35— contd. The hottest months are June, July and August, during which months there are generally strong north-west winds with much dust. After the first week in October there is generally a drop in the day temperature. Rain seldom falls Jjefore December, but in that month and in January it is fre quent. Rain storms continue at intervals during February and March and occasionally in April.

In the dry season the track is passable by all arms, but at a time of high floods or after heavy rain it becomes impass able for wheeled traffic and difficult for pack transport. From mile 9 onwards the greater part of the track is actually under water in the flood season. The ground is mostly flat, but in places slightly undulating. The starting place is half a mile east of the Turkish Isolation Hospital. Up to mile 5 a line of sand dunes, 15 to 20 feet high, run parallel to and north of the'track. At mile 9 the Du’aiji canal, forming no obstacle is passed. At mile 14 the Nahr Abul Arabid, which here forms the Persian Frontier is crossed, and at mile 16^ the small village of Araith is passed on the right. Manduwan is a small village some three miles from the Shatt-al-’Arab on the eastern bank of the Nahr Khayain, a small creek which supplies it with water. It has a grove of date palms and there is in the vicinity a certain amount of brush wood available for fuel. There is a little grazing for horses and camels, but no other supplies are available. The camping ground lies on the west bank of the Nahr Khayain and there is a sufficient camping space for an InfantryRoute INo. 35— contd. Division or a Cavalry Brigade. Water good from Nahr Khayain,. but slightly brackish. An alternative to the above is to follow a line a little north of east for the first nine or ten miles. This keeps to the north of two lines of palm trees and avoids the soft ground near them. Just east of the second clump of palms the direction should be changed to a little S. of E. and then runs in a direct line for Manduwan. This avoids the damp ground which is sometimes encountered fur ther inland and also the bad ground east of the Siaijji Creek. This alternative route is also bad for light lorries and im possible for heavy ones. This stage was traversed by the 23rd Cavalry, in April, 1915. 2 SALMANEH ISLAND . 12.—General direction of Stage North-North- 30 East. The track runs on a bearing of 64 degrees over open desert, which in the dry season is good going for all arms. As the floods rise the water from the Karun river spreads north-west and renders this stage impassable. It, however, normally is still practi cable up to the beginning of April, though a detour may have to be made to the northwards. Camping ground on the bank of the Karun river one mile below Salmaneh Island. Water good and plentiful from river. Landing place good. Limited supply of brushwood fuel. Plentiful camel grazing in vicinity. No supplies. 3 ALI IBIN AL HUSAIN 16.—General direction of Stage North-North- 46 East, following right bank of Karun river. Distance by river 21 miles. The track is in dry weather, good going for all arms. After rain it becomes heavy for wheeled transport, and in the flood season the first five miles are liable to flood. There are a few shallow nalas to be crossed; these form no obstacle. From the last camping ground strike due north- until the river is met at mile 5 then follow the river. At mile266 Route No. 35— contd. 5 there is a good landing place, and unlimited space for camp ing, with a little camel grazing and fuel. At mile 10 Rubin’s Tomb and Rehvali are passed on the right of the track. At mile 12 Adhrat Island is passed, opposite which there is a good landing place. From mile 12£ to mile 14 marsh extends along the left* of this track and about 2 miles from it. The water of the marsh is drinkable, and there is good grazing for horses along its edges. Camping ground on river bank oppo site a single palm tree on eastern bank. Space unlimited. Water good and plentiful from river but owing to steepness of banks, buckets must be used for drawing water. Landing place good. Limited supply of scrub fuel and camel grazing. No supplies. 4 SAB’EH . . • 11.—General direction of Stage North-North- 57 West. Distance by river 24 miles. The track runs over open desert and in the dry season is excellent going for all arms. After rain it becomes heavy. There are no obstacles. From the last camping ground the Tomb of Saiyid Abud bearing N. W., forms a conspicuous landmark. The track passes about 3 miles east of this Tomb. At mile 5 the date palms of Sab’eh become visible. From this point onwards, the country west of the track is extensively cultivated and affords plentiful grazing for horses. The camping ground is 300 yards south of Sab’eh. Water good and plentiful from river. Good landing place with shelving banks. Camel graz ing and tamarisk fuel plentiful. No supplies. 5 FARSIAT . . . 14.—General direction of Stage due North, 71 roughly following river bank. Distance by river 16 miles. The track runs for the mos't part over open desert, which in the dry season is good going for all arms, but after rain becomes heavy for wheeled transport. At mile 2 the track crosses a stretch of cultivation and grass land, which extends as far as Qasarieh at mile 7, and affords plentiful grazing for horses. From there onwards ‘there is a well defined track as far as Farsiat. At mile 12 a267 Route No. 35— contd. for camp. .0 Rubin's track, it there is a extends it.

Camping ground 2 miles below Farsiat on river bank. Water good and plentiful. Landing place good with steep banks. Plentiful camel grazing and tamarisk fuel. A little grazing for horses is also obtainable. No supplies. Opposite the camping ground on the left bank of the Karim there are three conspicuous knolls. 6 MILA’IHAN . . 12.—General direction of Stage N. E. Distance 83 by river 15 miles. The track lies mainly over open desert, though there are stretches of cultivation at intervals. It is passable by all arms, but becomes very heavy and muddy after rain. There is plenti ful grazing for horses to be obtained throughout. There are no obstacles. At mile 7 at the bend of the river, there is a suitable camp ing site with a good landing place. From this point a con spicuous ruined tower bears 307 degrees and is distant about 2£ miles. The route followed by General Gorringe’s column in 1915 left the Karun here at a bearing of 334 degrees. The old bed of the Kharkeh river, forming a difficult obstacle for wheeled transport, was crossed at 9 miles from the Karun, and the route then ran N. E. of Umm nr Bans, which is reached at mile 18. The Mila’ihan (locally known as Makhdoah) camping ground is on river bank. Water good and plentiful. Good landing place with steep banks. Limited camel grazing and scrub fuel. No supplies. 7 AHWAZ . . . 13.—General direction of stage N. E. Dist- 96 an'ce by river 26 miles. The track runs over open desert which is for the most past covered with short grass, affording good grazing. Several stretches of cultivation are crossed. The track is passable by all arms, but becomes very heavy after rain. At mile 3 the village of Ummut Tamair is passed on the right. At mile 4 the old bed of the Karkbeh river, which268 Route No. 35— concld. here forms no obstacle, is crossed. From here the track does not follow the river, but runs direct to Aminyieh, which it reaches at mile 12. Aminyieh is a village of about 65 mud houses. Some wheat and barley is grown and there is good camel grazing. Excellent water from Earun river and a good steamer landing. Aminyieh is situated below the Ahwaz rapids and nearly opposite Bandar Nasiri with which it is connected by a ferry. Bandar Nasiri is a small but flourish- in 0, town, the centre for local trade and the point of tranship ment for cargoes for the upper Karun. It is the starting point of the Lynch road running through Ahwaz and the Bakhtiari country to Ispahan. There is also a horse tramv ay between Bandar Nasiri and Ahwaz. The route follows the Lynch road into Ahwaz. Route No. 36. From MAHlDASHT to ’ALI-AL-GHARBI. 183 miles. 10 stages (roughly). Authorities .— Berotki and Ahmad Khan, Russian Cossack Patrol, 1916. Epitome.—The road for the most part is bad, being in many places difficult even for pack animals. The informa tion given bears out that given in the alternative stages to Routes 45 and 46. Water .—Good water obtainable everywhere except in_ the last stage on the plain between the hills and ’Ali-al-Gharbi. Fuel .—Always obtainable in the hills. Fodder .—Grazing is good and universal except for 12 miles before reaching the hills of Shah Nachir. Supplies .—Arrangement for a large force would have ^ to be made in advance. The Cossack Patrol (110 men) obtained what they required en route. The route followed was :— MAHlDASHT. 10 Z AIL AN.( 271 ) APPENDIX A. Important personages. Shaikh Khazal Khan, K.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., of Muharmnareh '(Sardar-i-Arfa’) was born in 1861, and succeeded his brother in 1897. He is to all intents and purposes independent of the Persian Government. He has always been consistently friendly to the British, and now in his old age depends more than ever on British advice. He is a capable and sensible man; his in fluence reaches as far as Dizul, where the Lurs even respect him. He owns much territory on Turkish soil. Shaikh Chasib, Shaikh Khazal’s eldest son and heir was bom in 1891. He was Governor of Ahwaz in 1912-13, but was said to be puerile and neglectful. Even the Shaikh was doubt ful whether the Arabs would accept him as chief. Haji Rais-ul-Tujjar, the Shaikh’s right-hand man, born about 1850, an important and wealthy merchant. He is very friendly to the British, but not fully trusted by the Arabs. Both he and his son Mushir-ut-Tujjar have travelled in India. A very capable man in his prime, but is now too old to do much. His son may succeed him as the Shaikh’s Wazir. Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Raza Quli Khan, appointed in 1914 to the governorship of Luristan. He had previously held the governorship of Bushire, ’Arabistan and Ears. In the latter he incurred British displeasure, but subsequently made amends and obtained British protection. He is said to. be weak and in competent. Sir W. Townley in 1914 found him furtive and un reliable, and intent on feathering his own nest. He is said to have been aiding the Turks and Germans and was with the former at Kaunia. His levies are reported to have deserted him. Reported to be vali of Kirmanshah. The Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, Qhulam Riza Khan, hereditary ruler of the Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh is in alliance with the Shaikh of Muhammareh, being a member of the famous League of the South, which included the Qashqai and some of the Bakhtiari Khans. He is described as vicious-minded and not a manof ability or force of character. He now professes neutrality and recently refused to allow Turkish troops to cross his terri tory. Shaikh of Kuwait.—Salim Ibn Mubarik Subah el-Khalifa, succeeded his brother in February, 1917. Friendly to Great Britain. 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Sa’ud, K.C.I.E .—Wahabi Shaikh of In May 1913, he drove the Turks out of A1 Hasa, and m May 1914 was appointed Wali and Commander-in-Chief of Na]d. under the nominal sovereignty of Turkey. He could raise 5,000 to 7,000 well armed fighting men. He stands head and shoulders above other Arab chiefs, and they have implicit faith in him. We have recently made a treaty with him, November 1916. Friendly to Great Britain. Ajaimi .—Son of Sa’adun Pasha, late chief of the Muntafik Arabs. Sa’adun Pasha was arrested by the Turks in August 1911 through the treachery of Saiyid Talib, and deported to Aleppo, where he died immediately after his arrival. Ajaimi’s headquarters are now at Al’ain. He is actively hostile to us. Ibn Rashid .—’Abdul ’Aziz Ibn Mata’ab. Ruler of the Sham- mar tribe in northern Najd with headquarters at Hail. A rival of Bin Sa’ud and a protege o^ the Turkish Government. Owing to an ancestor of the ruling family of the Shammar tribe having been called Rashid, the ruler of the day is usually spoken of as Ibn Rashid. Has taken no actively hostile action against us but in the pay of the Turks.APPENDIX C. WEIGHTS, MEASURES, CURRENCY, CHRONOLOGY. Weights .—The standards of weight vary from place to place, and we shall, therefore, deal chiefly with those of Baghdad, the commercial capital. At Baghdad two systems of weighment exist side by side which may be called the local and the non-local. The first is applied, with certain exceptions, to local produce and is founded upon the Baghdad or large Huqqah—in English generally called “ Oke ”—of 8 lbs. 12 oz. 8 dr. English : the other has for its basis the Constantinople Huqqah of 2 lbs. 12 oz. 12 dr. English and is used for all imported, and even for certain other articles. The Baghdad local weights remain the same whatever the substance weighed and are as follows :— Engliish. lbs. oz. dr. 1 Ruba’ . 0 8 124 Ruba’ . . 1 W aqiyah 2 3 2 Waqiyah . 1 Huqqah . 8 12 8 Huqqahs . 1 Charak 13 2 12 Charaks . 1 Mann 52 11 0 Manns . 1 Waznah . 210 12 0 Waznahs . 1 Taghar . 4,215 0 0 Wood and charcoal are weighed by a Waznah of 50 Constan tinople Huqqahs or 139 lbs. 3 oz. 8 dr. English : wheat and barley by a different Waznah of 78 Constantinople Huqqahs or 218 lbs. 2 oz. 8 dr. English. In the case of wood, 20 Waznahs or 1,000 Constantinople Huqqahs make a Taghar of 3,784 lbs. 6 oz. 0 drs. English. The French kilogramme, equal to 2'20485 lbs. English, is in use to a limited extent as an official measure under the name of Huqqah ’Ashshari or decimal Huqqah, and 100 kilogrammes are treated in the case of grain as equivalent to 1 Waznah. Apothecaries employ the French kilogramme with its sub-division and multiples. ( 2S0 ) o281 t At Basrah the unit of local weight is a Huqqah of 2 lbs. 12 oz. English and the local Waqiyah is 2£ Huqqahs. A Mann of ghi at Basrah is 50 local Huqqahs and a Mann of grain 60; and the Basrah Taghar containing 1,200 Huqqahs is treated as roughly equivalent to 1J tons English. Measures. —At Baghdad there are three measures of length each founded upon a different Dhara’ or “ yard. ” The Dhara’ Baghdad—or Baghdad yard—is the most generally used and is equal to 29| English inches; it is sub-divided into 4 Charaks of 7 t V inches apiece, and each of these again in to 4 ’Aqads of 1|| inches apiece. The Dhara’ Halab—or Aleppo yard is employed in measuring silks and woollens and is equal to 26£ inches; it is sub-divided in a similar manner to the Baghdad yard, giving a Charak consequently of 6| and an ’Aqad of 1-^ inches. In measuring carpets and in other transactions with Persians the standard is the Dhara’ Shah—of about 41 inches; its Charak also called a Ruba’, equals 10^, and its ’Aqad 2f inches. British goods are estimated in British yards, and other European goods in French metres. Thus we have three different Charaks of length, as well as the Charak of weight, and a Ruba’ of length besides the Ruba’ of weight. Liquids. —There are no standard measures for liquids, and these are sold by the pot or the bottle, the pots being of all sizes and the bottles generally reputed pints or quarts. Distances. —Distances, except in official measurements which are made by Kilometres, are estimated in hours and days; the t unit is the space covered by a walking horse in sixty minutes and so fluctuates from about 3 to 4J miles. | Land measurement. —The commonest unit of land measure ment is the Faddan—which varies in size from one place to an other, 'and at Baghdad is variously defined as “ the area that two men can cultivate ” or “ a surface that can be completely sown with 500 Huqqahs of wheat and 700 Huqqahs of barley,” in all 1,200 (Constantinople) Huqqahs. The Baghdad Faddan is also described as containing 200 Donums—each of 919 square metres, and as being equal to 18 Jaribs, each of 10,000 square metres or rather more : this would give the Faddan an area of about 44|- acres. The Donum, it should be mentioned, is sub divided into 1,600 Dhira’ Ma’mari. There is also a Juft, the area that a yoke of bullocks can plough, which is from 70 to 100 Donums. At Basrah the Faddan is unknown, and the unit282 38. 12 OZ, an of ghi ; and the s roughly of length e Ohara’ ised and Charaks dsofl|| mplojed lehes; it giving a es.

Currency .—The question of the currency in ’Iraq is difficult and complicated. The only fixed standard of value is the Lirah or Turkish pound, ordinarily worth about 18s. of British money and to it all other coins and denominations must be regarded as subsidiary; they are numerous and some of them are ficti tious, while the value of others are fluctuating. The subject is discussed below with reference to Baghdad rather than to Basrah. The Lirah is habitually resolved into no less than six different varieties of piastre or Qursh—all of which are ficti tious. The first of these is the “ gold ” piastre, which is simply T ^oOf a Lirah and is the official piastre of the Turkish Govern ment; all taxes and all payments to State departments must be rendered in gold piastres; for example, a one piastre postage stamp can only be purchased for a coin which, whatever its denomination may be, is currently worth of a Lirah. The next three kinds of piastre are all termed Majidiyah—but properly the name belongs to the first of them alone, of which 102’6 go to a Lirah; the Imperial Ottoman Bank keeps its. accounts in these as well as in gold piastres. The remaining sorts of Majidiyah piastre are one of which 103'5, and anotner of which 108 are equal to a Lirah; the former of these is used' by merchants in keeping their own books and for wholesale transactions generally, while the latter is employed partly for ease of calculation, and partly on account of its close corres pondence in value to the actual silver coin called a Qursh Saghv. The two remaining kinds of piastre, both called Raij—arb employed in retail accounts; of the one there are 414 and of the- other 432 to the Lirah, from which it will be seen that they are' merely quarters of Majidiyah piastres standing at 103'5 aiwt 108 to the Lirah. We now come to the actual medium of circulation. There are five Turkish gold coins of 5, 24, 1, £ and i Lirahs respec tively; but the first two are rarely seen, and the last is not very common. The chief Turkish silver coin is the Majidi— which is worth 18-5185 gold piastres, 19,19 '166 and 20 re spectively of the various kinds of Maiidivah piastre, and 76’666 and 80 respectively of the two sorts of Raij piastre. In cash transactions, in the absence of a special understanding, 5’4 Majidis are accepted as the equivalent of one Lirah. The' table o 2283 of smaller coins and their approximate English values is as follows the Parah, with which it opens, is an imaginary coin, but the others (in the second column) have a material existence :— £ s. d. 5 Parahs . 1 Fulsain 0 0 01 2 -Fulsain . 1 Qursh Raij or Mitliq 0 0 0£ 2 Mitliqs . 1 Qamari 0 0 1 4 Mitliqs . 1 Qursh Sagh 0 0 2 5 Mitliqs 1 Ruba’ Bashlik or Abu 0 0 2i Khamsah. 8 Mitliqs . 1 Qurshain Sagh or Abu 0 0 4 Thamaniyah. 10 Mitliqs . 1 Nusf Bashlik or Abu 0 0 5 ’Ashra,h. 2 Nusf Bashliks , 1 Bashlik or Ruba’ 0 0 lOJ Majidi. 2 Bashliks . 1 Nusf Majidi 0 1 8£ 2 Nusf Majidis 1 Majidi 0 3 5|- these small coins the Fulsain and Mutlik are believed consist of nickel, the Qamari, Abu Khamsah and Abu ’Ashrah of some alloy; and the remainder of silver. The half and quarter Bashlik and the Fulsain are uncommon, and the others, ex cept the Mitliq, are by no means plentiful. The deficiency is made up with foreign coin, chiefly Persian, which circulates freely in spite of a prohibition against the use of foreign silver. Only a little Persian gold is seen; but various Persian coins make up the bulk of the silver currency, namely the double Qran of 8bd., the Qran of 4Jd., the half Qran of 2d., the quarter Qran of Id. and a Sittah Fulus—worth |d. A Persian copper coin (erroneously called a Shahi) is also in use; it is •worth of a penny. One Persian Tuman, as will be seen, is at the present time about equal to one Turkish Majidi, and there are over 50 Qrans to the Lirah; merchants’ accounts, however, where kept in Qrans, are kept in a fictitious Qran of which 34'4 go to the Lirah. Indian silver is current, .hut is occasionally seized by the authorities under the law already mentioned; Persian silver, being absolutely indispensable tothe continuance of business, is never interfered with. Some English, French, and Russian gold is in circulation. It re mains to notice one more coin and that fictitious—the Shami— which is the unit of computation in the date trade. There was once an actual coin of this name with a nominal value of 10 gold piastres, but that value having been reduced by order of the Turkish Government after the last Russo-Turkish war to gold piastres, which was less than the price of the metal it contained, it was everywhere melted down and has now altogether dis appeared except from the quotations of the date market. At the time of the occupation of Basrah, Turkish, Persian, and Indian silver coinage was current in about equal proportions in Iraq. The Turkish and Indian silver coinage had a fixed value relative to the Lii^ah and Sovereign respectively. The Persian coinage, not being strengthened by a gold issue, fluc tuated greatly, but large quantities were brought in by Persian pilgrims every year, thus rendering nugatory the current prohi bition against import of foreign silver. From the first Expeditionary Force has been financed practi cally entirely by imports from India of Rupees, with the proper proportion of small coin, both copper and nickel, as well as Indian currency notes, which have always been very popular. Practically no gold has been used. Considerable quantities of Turkish Lirahs are still in circula tion and are current at exaggerated rates approximately 10 per cent, in excess of their Rupee value in time of peace. The Kran was current at about 4d. until February 1915 and very large quantities were brought at that price 'by Government for the purchase of mules, sheep, etc., in south-west Persia for the use of the Force. In February, however, the exchange fell suddenly from Krans 412 = Rupees 100 to Krans 340 = Rupees 100, i.e., wheat, barley, mules, etc., began to cost us about 25 per cent, more than before, and Krans in sufficient numbers, even at this rate, were practically unobtainable. The difficulty was a serious one, and means have not yet been found to circumvent it adequately. It is apparently due firstly to the recent rise in the price'of silver, secondly to the flooding of North Persia with Russian paper money, and thirdly to the curtailed coinage of new Persian currency due to the difficulty of importing silver. The question is under discussion with the Imperial Bank of Persia in Teheran, through His Majesty’s Minister and with the Government of India..285 Turkish silver coinage is practically not current and is subject to a very heavy local discount. For purchases in Arabia of camels, etc., it has been necessary to import large quantities of Maria Theresa Dollars from Aden and Masqat; this coin is still the sole recognised currency in Central Arabia. The coinage of A1 Hasa is peculiar to the district, and includes the Turkish pound or lirah, the Maria Theresa dollar, the rupee, the tawila, and copper coins from India, Masqat, Zanzibar, German and British East Africa. Of these the Maria Theresa dollars are coined specially for Arabia and parts of East Africa * and all bear the date 1780. They are known as rials. The tawila or long bit is one of the so-called fishhook coins. It is merely a piece of copper, shaped like a compressed Y, with some Arabic characters stamped on it. These have not been coined for several hundred years, and A1 Hsa is the only place in which they are current. For currency of Kuwait are page 48. Chronology .—The Moslem day is reckoned from sunset to sunset and is divided into 24 hours, which are counted as twice 12. Sunset is reckoned as 12 o’clock, and is the fixed reckoning for each day. Twelve hours after sunset is again 12 o’clock. The Moslem calendar begins with 16th July, in the year 622 A.D., this being the date of the Hajirah or flight of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina. The Moslem year is a purely lunar year of 12 months. Each of the odd-numbered months contain 29 days, each of the even-numbered months 30 days. There are thus 345 days in the year, or 355 in leap year, 11 of which occur in each cycle of 30 years. In the course of 33 years each month makes a complete circuit of the seasons. On the 25th February, 1906, began the year 1324 of the Hajirah, but the official or financial year is now reckoned 2 years earlier, consequently the Turkish year, 1327. now corresponds to our 1911.APPENDIX D. SOME NOTES FOR OFFICERS PROCEEDING TO MESOPOTAMIA. 1. Purchase of kit. —A few shops have been started at Basrah where a certain amount of kit can be got, but as they have to pay 10 per cent, duty plus freight it is far cheaper to get things in India. 2. Climate and clothing.—Climate has great extremes of heat and cold. December, January, February are very cold, and often very cold winds prevail; the sun is usually hot in the middle of the day, there are fogs in the morning occasionally; the nights are often bitterly cold with occasional frost. During these months thick winter clothing is necessary, such as'flannel shirts, cardigan jackets, flannel pyjamas and coat, warm, British; it is advisable to have a suit of khaki serge available for these months. Three good blankets and a Jaeger sleeping bag are recommended. May, June, July, August and September are extremely hot and moi*t, temperature ranging from 100° to 125°, with very sultry nights, and extremely hot sun in the day time. Prickly heat is very prevalent. It is advisable to have a good supply of thin puggaree cloth shirts, and a coat of the same material, or dispense with a coat and have shoulder straps put on the shirt for badges of rank. A spine pad is essential (can be obtained locally from Supply and Transport), and a thick topee (L awnpore pattern topees are very good and are usually worn instead of helmets). Thin pyjamas are required. A good pair of dark or amber glasses with dust proof sides fitting closely (or motor goggles) are absolutely essential all the year round, as the dust storms are extremely bad, and the glare from the water and desert extremely trying to the eyes. • rema ™ n g months are warm in the day time, but the nights are fairly cool as a rule. The rainfall is small, about 6 inches a year; showers may occur at any time. Officers are advised to take both their hot and cold weather clothing with them, and to store what is not immediately required at the Combined Base Depot, Basrah.287 3. Water .—The river is the best supply, when available; it is muddy as a rule, and requires sedimentation with alum; it should always be boiled or chlorinated. The water for drinking purposes should always be taken from the middle of the main stream if possible, and never from the small creeks which are always badly polluted. The other source of water is from wells on the desert; it is nearly always brackish and very unpleasant to taste and extremely hard; a pinch of Soda Bicarb often improves it; this water is liable to cause diarrhoea. Some of these wells are quite good as far as organic pollution is concerned, but one occasionally finds them polluted with dead cattle. 4. Medical .-—Officers are advised to take the following:—' A clinical thermometer. Phenacitin. Aspirin. Quinine. Chlorodyne. Cascara. Citronella (for mosquitoes and sandflies). Keating’s Powder. A small quantity of alum and bicarbonate of soda. 5. Additional articles of kit .—The following, additional articles of kit are recommended :— Mosquito curtains. Waterproof (heavy rain may be expected in December and January). Small electric torch. Camp candle lamp with spare candles for emergencies (oil for lamps can usually be obtained from Supply and Transport). Berkfeld filter with spare candles. Small emergency cooking set, cup, plate, etc., for personal use. Tents and camp beds should be taken. The latter may be reouired in many 'places as well as on the river 6 .. inents sidere* from c Offi leaving advane rithtli Disbffi The rill be ' (•} funnii balane (»]steamers where officers also usually have to make their own arrangements for food. 6. Financial arrangements .—Officers taking up staff appoint ments draw their pay from date of embarkation and are con sidered as on Field Service for purpose of concessions, etc., from date of embarkation. Officers are advised to take 3 months’ advance of pay before leaving India and to bank what is not required, in India. The advance may be recovered in 9 monthly instalments if desired, with the approval of the Field Controller, Basrah (through Field Disbursing Officer). The pay and allowances of British Officers in Force “ D ” will be drawn and accounted for as follows. These instructions- apply equally to staff, departmental and regimental officers (both of British and Indian regiments). (i) Officers will not be finally settled up with monthly. A running ledger account will be maintained for each officer, balances being carried forward from month to month. (ii) Officers should arrange their pay as follows :— (a) If they have not already arranged for an allotment and they desire to make one, they should write to their D. D. 0. at the base at once, asking him to arrange for a monthly allotment of a definite sum of rupees to be paid monthly to their agents or representatives either in India or in England. Full particulars as to the address of the agent or representative, the exact amount they desire to allot monthly in rupees, and the month’s pay from which the first allotment is to be made should be given. In the case of Indian allotments, * the D. D. 0. at the base will arrange for these to be paid monthly by the D. D. 0. of the division in India from which their unit proceeded. In the case of home allotments the D. D. 0. at the base will arrange for these to be paid monthly by the India Office. They should so arrange their pay that, after deducting their allotments and allowing for amounts due to Government on account of payment issues, they have left themselves a sufficient balance of289 their pay in the field to meet such ordinary * advances as they may require to draw during the following month. As a rough guide, it was found by a staff officer (Brigade Major) at the front that about Rs. 220 a month was sufficient to cover local expenses including cash payments to servants, messing, payments to Supply and Transport for servants’ clothing and horse gear, and cash for incidental expenses. Ordinary advances against the balance of their pay remain ing in the field may be drawn from the nearest F. T. C. 0. The following example shows how an officer may arrange his pay and fix his allotment on this system :— (Example.) An officer’s available pay (after allowing for family pension subscription in the case of an Indian Army officer) is say ..... Deduct — Amount he wishes to draw against as advances in the field and for payment of extra rations, etc., say ....... Rs. 600 150 Balance available for making an allotment pay able monthly in England or in India . . 450 Special Note .—In making allotments it should be parti cularly noted that an allotment is a definite fixed sum and it is therefore not permissible for an officer to ask for the balance of his pay to be remitted monthly in lieu of fixing an allotment. If he does not make a fixed allotment the balance of his pay will remain to his credit in the field accounts and can only be remitted once in about 3 months as an accumulated balance, as explained in the following paragraph. (Hi) It is not necessary for an officer to draw in the field his monthly available balance, as this balance will be carried forward to his credit month by month by the D. D. O., who will keep a ledger account of each officer. If after a few months290 an officer has accumulated a larger balance than he requires with the D. D. 0. in the field, he can instruct the D. D. 0. to remit it to an agent in India, or to the India Office for payment to his nominee, in addition to his regular allotment. (iv) A monthly statement of his accounts will be sent to each officer. (v) If exceptional circumstances render it necessary for an officer to draw money in excess of the balance available to his credit in the field, he can obtain an “ emergency ” advance (not exceeding Rs. 75 at any one time) on a written order from tTie G. 0. C. the Brigade or O. C. Station or any of their staff officers who may have authority to sign. (vi) Officers will give the F. T. C. 0. receipts for advances in triplicate, and in the case of ordinary advances drawn against their credits available in the field, they will also furnish to the same officer the certificate below. F. T. C. Os. will keep a stock of these forms :— Application for an ordinary advance of pay. Rank and name of officer applying for an advance. Corps or department. Official designation. Amount of advances required. On what account.

Station Date Signature. (vii) In the case of regimental officers, when the officer com manding wishes to draw in one sum ordinary or emergency advances for a number of officers, he must at once furnish the D. D. 0. with an acquittance roll signed by each officer showing how the money [for which he has given receipt, see (vi)] has been disbursed. The certificate mentioned in (vi) must also be signed by the officers and given to the paying officer, who will attach291 them to his acquittance roll. Regimental officers may draw their pay separately but should not do so as a rule unless sepa rated from headquarters of their units. {viii) The amounts of agents and family allotments may be altered on due notice being given to the D. D. 0. at the base. As these allotments are paid monthly in England or India on the 1st of each month, sufficient notice must be given so that the India Office or D.

Week-end telegrams to India or Home can be sent from Basrah at quarter rates.10.

Most of the cases of enteric and paratyphoid and a good deal of dysentery is caused by them. Very little fruit is obtainable until May, so friends sending “ comforts ” may be'advised to include dried fruit, figs, prunes, etc. Tinned butter and condensed milk are not easy to obtain locally. Private stores despatched to officers with the Force should be clearly marked in block capitals with the name of the Depart ment or Unit to which consigned.
