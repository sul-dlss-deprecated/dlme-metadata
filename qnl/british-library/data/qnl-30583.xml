One of the areas of which it is considered that it would be useful to make a film is the Persian Gulf 5 and it has been suggested that the film might deal with subjects such as the dhow traffic, pearl fishing, aspects of Indian trade, protection given by the Navy against submarines and in suppress ing slavery, oil and so on. 2. One of the main difficulties in producing 'shorts” of this kind is that although India can provide very good technician; for filming, there is a serious shortage of suitable talent for direction. It has therefore been suggested that we should produce the rough script(s) for a film(s) of the Persian Gulf which would then be examined by one of the available Directors in India with a view to sending a special unit to the Persian Gulf to make the film(s) if the script(s) prove(s) suitable. What is required is not a 'shooting script' but only a general outline of what should be included in the film, in other words a rough script which would describe the scenes to be photographed and indicate what should be said about each scene. 3. Caroe is very keen to produce a film dealing with the Persian Gulf and in his absence I am writing to enquire whether you could arrange for the preparation of a script of the kind required dealing with such subjects as you think would interest India. A film of the Gulf would be excellent publicity and well worth the trouble involved, and we hope that you will agree to take this on. Sd. xxxxxx The Hon.

The Hon'ble 3ir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.THE Pl^HSIAN GULF. V Sand and palms sc ene. Shot of Ras Musandim (mountains at mouth of Gulf) I have no doubt that the immediate mental reaction to the words M Persian Gulf” on the part of the members of the Indian Institute of International Affairs, as of other ?/ell-informed people, is aome comment on the climate of those sun-smitten and scantily-watered coasts; and even ~*5 its most ardent devotees do not pretend that it is 'Fardaus bar-rjx-yi-zamin'. I do not want to open this paper with a discussion of that absorbing topic, the weather, but it may be of interest to see just how and why the Gulf enjoys its unenviable reputation. It has nobody but itself to blame, and the reason is the shallowness of its waters. Inside the narrow Straits of Hormuz, the Gulf rarely sinks below 50 fathoms• For miles along the Arab coast ( in particular over the great Pearl Bank) the soundings rarely exceed 10 fathoms, and near the islands are great stretches which dry out completely at low tides. In fact, we may take the average depth of the thousands of square miles of the Gulf»s waters to be something like the height of the India Arch in New Delhi. One has tonly to think of the effect of leaving a saucer containing a millimetre's depth of water to stand in the sun on a hot day. Picture yourself living at the end of the saucer, and you have the Gulf in July. (Omit in filming) 2. Well, I only opened this subject of the weather, because I want to draw conclusions from it. The point I am aim to bring out is that mankind needs strong reasons to induce him to live in so uncongenial a climate, accompanied by its brackish water and scanty Vegetation, indeed, only where there is any break in the sandhills of the Arab side or the sun baked mountains of the Persian coast. The answer which I believe to be the truth is that the Persian Gulf has a unique appeal to adventurers. To live there is to enjoy a spaciousness of life which is unknown in more highly civilized and closely administered countries; and for those engaged in commerce, there are many chances of quick and easy wealth, away from the harsh competition of their home countries. Tf merchant adventurer in these waters xi^nesirea whose name will occur to everyone is the legendary inci.-le in name of Sinbad. Though legendary, he is actually commentary]^in- representative of a former ( very much alive) elude a shot from class of Middle East merchants. What fortunes his some historial film. Shots of dhows sailing and rowing;cargo handling etfi. Dhow building yards in Kuwait• voyages down to the waters of the Gulf brought him, Sheherazad told better than I ever can. We cannot, of course, say for certain v/here Sindbad's enchanted islands lie. Much of his history bears the imprint of the tales of the universal longshoreman, who is the same all the world over; and some of his adventures are the exact counterpart of those with which Ulysses must have so often wearied Penelope, when after his wanderings from fallen Troy, he at length regained his home at Ithaco. Sheherazad, it seems, owed her life ? in part at least, to the genius of blind old Homer. It seems fairly clear that some at least of Sindbad's voyages were to the East African coast, to which and from which the dhows of Kuwait and Basra still ply on the seasonal breezes of the winter, returning to tks. the Gulf for the great pearl dive of the summer, when the monsoon is blowing in the India Ocean and sailing craft cannot face the weather outside. Sindbad ( I am still using his name, though by him I mean the merchant adventurers of Basra) thouigh undoubtedly also visited India, Ceylon and even further India-Burma, Malaya and Java. He may even have gone so far as China.. /_J? Htmxxxvtx Perhaps here cut in Picture of a medieval galleon. Animation on map. Om^ in filming Shot of Muscat. r-\ —&gt; Trucial Coast scenes Sea scene Muscat harbour .. But after him the curtain of history fall again till fiuropean galleons sail in at the Straits of Hormuz, having rounded the Cape of Good Hope in the wake of Vasco da Gama. Then began the struggle of Portuguese, Dutch and English for the trade of the Gulf, for the favour of Pers ian Khans and princes, for the establishment of their factories ( agencies, as we should now call them). The details of that struggle I need not give. The significant thing for us is that the two main rivals based themselves on India; and the struggle passed slowly from a contest of England with Portugal to a contest of Bombay with Goa. India, after her forgotten wave of expansion to the is lands which now are the Netherlands East Indies, again began to look beyond the seas; and it was to the Persian Gulf that her eyes turned. Jask, Bandar Abbas, Bushire - all along the Persian coast the East India Coy. established its factories; until finally in 1763, Basra became its chief trading establishment. The southern, or Arab, coast, as you see, was left neglected. The treasures of oil, which, aided by the xenophobic commercial policy of the late Shah of Persia, have in the last half-centu»y swung the balance across the Gulf, still lay undreamed of below the surface• 5. Side by side with the urge to peaceful trade went responsibility for peace, health and safe navigation in the Gulf coasts and waters; and the next phase was the slow transference from the Interests of a strictly commercial company to the wider outlook and developing policy of a Government. This started long before the transference of actual government in India from the Company to the Crown. Early in the 19th century, the Company appointed its Political Agents in Muscat ( and it is a tragic commentary on the devotion of these men, as well as on the Muscat summer, that three out of the first four died at their post, and now lie on the shore of a lonely little bay opposite the Political Agency, surrounded by mountains and accessible only by sea). 6 . India's first great problem in developing her new field of trade was the suppression of piracy. Along the southern shore of the Gulf, formerly called the Pirate Coast, in the multitude of salt-water creeks lurked the Jawasimi corsairs - Qawasim, to give them their correct pronunciation. One by one, their strongholds were reduced until a final expedition was launched against Ras-al-Khaima (*'the headland of the ten*' - the name probably derived from a look-out post encamped on the end of the spit of land, past which ships must sail to enter the lagoon). The pirates were crushed and the '’maritime truce' of 1820 signed by every bhaikh. ( From this truce the coast derives its present name of Trucial Coast, a rather more respectable title than the old 'Pirate Coast'). The Gulf was safe for India's trade from the hand of man. It is perhaps of interest to remark that a few years ago, a gold dinar of Humayun's reign was dug up on the beach at Has-al-Khaima, and was presented by the writer to the British Museum. 7. After the ravages of man, the next enemy to be tackled was the stormy and uncharted sea, full of reefs, rocky islets, tide-rips and overfalls. To this takk the ships of the Bombay Marine, direct progenitor of the Royal Indian Navy, betook themselves, side by side with their sisters of the Royal Navy. Their names, with the name of every ship that has anchored in the harbour, are painted in white on the steep volcanic rocks that surround the port of Muscat. Above them flashes the modem light-house whic^with scores of other buoys and beacons, commenorates their achievement. Warships, cargo ships, and passenger ships have all written their names in this unique ' visitors' book.' French ships3 Shot of snip's name (close- up). Omit in film ing* Picture of a manir'* tssion certificate* Sloop under way Lau^hes coming alongside pass enger ship. Doc tor mounting gangway.

It was not enough to have peace for man on the high seas. He must have liberty on land also: and as the body of treaties between the Arab rulers end the Crown grew, each in turn outlawed the slave trade. They did not, of course agree to abolish domestic elavery: that was too deeply rooted in the custom of their states, and in fact it is not even now certain that the house-born slave always desires his liberty. A story which is a 'chestnut M in Gulf circles may perhaps be permitted here. An old man was talking to the Agency Burgeon in one of the Shaikhdoms and mentioned that he had a certificate to prove that he was the slave of so-and-so, granted him by the M Baliuz'• 'Baliuzns the universal Gulf word for a Political Agent, probably derived from the Greek or Vasilevs, which was the title of the Genoese envoy in the 16th - 17th century at the Sublime Porte. Soveral people interrupted protesting that the 'baliuz ' 1 could not possibly have given him such a certificate. The old man flew into a rage. 'Your lie* I have a certificate that I am the slave of so-and-so, and he is bound to feed and clothe me'. Proudly he produced his manumission certificate with its crossed Union Jacks and the Political agent's signature that he was a freed man. 9* Furtively and spasmodically, a few slaves are still kidnapped, mostly from Persian Baluchistan, and run ashore to be taken to Ibn Baud's dominions and sold. The men who dabble in this trade have taken advantage of the pre occupations of the Royal Indian Kavy and the Persian Gulf Division of the Royal Kavy with more deadly foes, to revive a traffic which before the war was almost stamped out. In Bahrain, indeed, even domestic slavery has been formally abolished; but everywhere else vdiere there is a Political Agent, nobody need ba a slave who chooses to apply at the Agency for manumission, and no-one fppm the Shaikh down ward dare disregard a manumission certificate. 10. After man's freedom, his health, and the important task ( in a maritime society) of quarantine. All posts now have doctors of the Indian Medical Department, who look after the British and Indian communities and their local servants, board ships to grant or refuse pratique, advise the rulers in urban hygiene and sanitation, and Jo magnificent charitable work among the local populations. 11. Perhaps I have talked long enough about the impact of the Gulf of civilizing influences from without, and ought to have given attention curlier to the indigenous peoples of the Gulf. I do not propose to delve into ethnological history. The important thing to remember is that a navigable stretch of sea like the Persian Gulf is a bond of union between its two shores rather than a dividing barrier. So we have a largd Persian trading community in Bahrain, and a considerable leavening of Persiars on the Trucial Coast. Similarly on the South Persian littore from a point midway between Bushire and Lingah, down to and beyond Lingah itself, the coastal tribes are of Arab origin, speak Arabic, ana have ' Shaikhs' instead of 'Kha’ In this area, the Persian gendarme or customs official looks an outlandish stranger. Round Bushire itself ar&lt;\7y Nomad tribes migratingj flocks &amp; herds* Bahrain grave yard* -4- the few tribes which are of purely Persian origin. In the hinterland of the coast, between Shiraz and Bushire, wander the Qashqai nomads, their name derived from the Turkish Kachmak ( to run away ), because they split off from the Seljuk Turks; and further south, above Lingah, are the grazing grounds of the Khamseh, the five tribes whose Arabic name betrays their racial origin. 12. The population is no less mixed on the Arab coast. Kuwait, indeed, with its close commercial links with the Bedu dwellers of the desert is nearly pure Arab. Bahrain has a 3hia population called the Baharina ( the name is merely the Arabic ' broken plural” of Bahraini) who represent the original population which dwelt there before the asxtgijudtx conquest of the island by its present rulers, the Al Khalifah-a sub-branch, originally, of the great Ajman tribe. It would be too tempting, and too commonplace, to bring in the familiar name of ,f Phoenician” in describing their origin. However, south of the tora of Manama, the capital of Bahrain, is a vast area of tumuli, c vering perhaps ten square niies of the island's surface; a phenomenon which gives point to the gibe of old inhabitants, when asked what Bahrain Is like, ” well, it has the largest gyaxiqaig* graveyard in the world”. It is claimed by these who have excavated these turauli, that the articles buried with the dead, and the posture of the skeletons ( their knees drawn up towards their chin) prove that the race which buried its dead here originated from the Mediterranean area . Omit in filming Hindu temple at Muscat Pearl diving scenes 13. Phoenician vt not as its inhabitants may have been, it is interesting that in the Middle Ages the Carraathian sect of the Ismaili Shias were strongly represented in Bahrain, from where they sent help and support to the Fatimici Caliphate in Egypt. Now, however, Ismailis in Bahrain could be counted on one's fingers, and the strong hold of that sect in the Gulf is at Muscat. This is, of course, a fresh immigration from India, and large numbers of the Khojas and Aga Khanis there still possess British nationality. Indian Bunnis are mostly to be found on the Trucial Coast, where they are gwairically called ” Hyderabadis”. They speak Arabic and wear .arab dress, except that they affect the coloured turban rather than the white, hanging Kufiyah of the desert. 14. Apart from Muslims, there are, of course, consider able colonics cf Hindu traders all up and down the coast; and their local name of ”banians” truly indicates India's predominant interest in the Gulf, namely the export trade to It. In Muscat the Hindu coAony ( nearly all Gujeratis) is particularly strong, and they have built for themselves a very fine temple in the best-watered part of the town's outskirts. A tragic memento of the former heyday of India's trade with the Persian coast of the Gulf is found in the presence of a Hindu temple in Bandar Abbas, now deserted. However, with the end cf autocracy in Persia, we may hope for a moreliberal commercial policy there, and puja may scon again bo clone in the temple at Bandar Abbas. 15. Indian traders are not only interested in the export trade; many of them engage also in the pearl trade. On the pearl banks the divers plunge from the side of thej ships all through the summer days, with their simple equipment of a clip for the nose and a v;ire basket for tk■ -5- \ V oysters torn from the sea bed. They go down on one rope, to which a heavy stone is attached; they are pulled up on another rope, two tugs on which are the signal for their 'puller * 1 to bend to his task and get them as quickly as possible to the surface where they can ease their strain ing lungs. Among the anchored n sambuqs w move the sailing boats (or more often, now-a-days. launches) of the M tawwafe**, merchants who regularly visit the banks and buy their pearls direct from the M sarubuq' captains. These latter are no mere ' deck off leers'. They are the business head and representative of the w'hole toiling community that comprises their ship's crew. One fifth only of the season's takings is reserved for the captain; the rest, after paying the ship's expenses and the share of the owner, is divided among the crew, divers receiving twice the share of the pullers, and even the ship's boys a small share. One may imagine how the captain is on trial in the eyes of his men as he sits on the poop of his ship, and hands coffee to the visiting Arab or Indian 'tawwaf', before engaging on long and technical arguments about the merits of the pearls he has to sell. 16. In these days, the natural pearl trade is facing grave competition from the growth cf the science^culturing pearls. Heavy punishment attends the introduction of a cultured pearl into the Gulf market; but other waters too produce oysters which can be artificially stimulated to make pearls by the introduction of a tiny grain of grit between the flesh and the shell. It is^fortunate circum stance that at the very time when the pearl trade of the Gulf began to wane, a bright new star of prosperity appeared on the horizon in the form of the scintillating dividends of oil concessions. At present every ruler in the Arab ccast, from the Sultan of Muscat down to the Shaikh of tiny Ajm&amp;n, holds a concession with one company or another. The pearl fleet has grown smaller and smaller year by year; but the men who formerly sought their living with bursting lungs and straining eer-drims, can now earn better pay helping to manipulate a drilling rig, driving a lorry or regulating refinery gauges. I^will not say whether this is progress or not; but it is at least prosperity. 17. Naturally, venturesome Indians have not been slow to avail themselves of the change of well-paid jobs that the Gulf now affords. In all oil companies a very high percentage of responsible technical and office posts are held by Indian, whose salaries add to that great sum which represents the commercial value of the Gulf to India. 18. Airways have not yet been mentioned , but this is not from any lack of importance. They may in the future become India's strongest link with the Gulf, but it will perhaps suffice to say this much, as a further paper specifically on communications in the Gulf is to be pre pared by the writer for the Institute. 19. If then we may draw a general conclusion, it must be that on this highway to the heart of the Middle East, which is India’s most natural sphere for commercial expansion, as it is the sphere in which she can most usefully contribute to the security of Asia, India has a&gt;1) $ : - 6 - • long and profitable history of enterprise; and she has, as a member of the British Commonwealth, a tradition of friendly and cooperative relations with ‘che Arab rulers* In latter years, the pre-war regime in Persia caused a contraction of Indian interests on the Persian side of the Gulf; but there is reason to believe that they will revive sifter the war, and increased trade both direct with India and with Indian traders.on the Arab coast may again lead to settlement of Indian enterprise on the northern shore of the Gulf.C OMMUNICJIO.Nij IK THE FERSIM GULF . Our globes show us that a vast barrier of mountains and desert, stretching from the Karakoram to Aden, shuts India off from communication with Europe and the Middle East. This barrier has its passes through which a conquering array can come, as India has often found to her cost. But for the contacts and commerce of peace time, sea-ways are the necessary vehicles, and of these there are two. The Red Sea, though she does not breach but only out-flanks the barrier, lifts her two fingers in the V-sign, as if in token of the supremacy she has enjoyed since the cutting of the Suez Canal. But that supremacy was not always here, and there are signs that it is already passing back again to her age- old rival, the Persian Gulf. 2. This stretch of water, thanks to the narrow breach in the mountain-desert barrier which the history laden straits of Hormuz afford, lays open to princely highway for Indian venturers to the very heart of the Middle East, the valley of the two rivers which cradled civilizations, when Indiajfli and Europe alike were barbarous and unlettered. 3. _ I spoke of the two sea lanes as rivals, and this indeed they are. It was the invention of the steamship even before the Suez Canal was opened, that made the R e d Sea the highroad to India. The Red Sea is no route for wind-propelled vessels, for in it the winds at each end flow inwards to the centre. Anyone who has sailed even a dingy knows that a run before the wind followed by a dead-beat into the wind’s eye, is a far slower business than a reach all the way. Moreover the oltf square-rigged ships of East India Company days and earlier would hardly sail within six points of the wind, and a dead-beat often meant that they would tack back and forth, gaining no ground at all. It may be remembered how Ireland was saved from invasion by Napoleon through the fact that a strong wind got up which blew straight down the narrow stretch of Bantry Bay, up which the laden transports were trying to beat, and blew them clean out into the ocean. The Red Sea has to thank James Watt, then, for her recent victory in her contest with the Cape route; and before that again she had to fight the Persian Gulf. 4. In those early days, the Cape route to the Indies was unknown, and travellers had to choose between a short overland haul across the Suez Isthmus followed by interminable days of beating back and forth in the Red Sea; or the longer trek from the Mediterranean to Basra, followed by the shorter sea voyage of the Persian Gulf • The latter had the further advantage of tapping rich markets en route , whereas the Red Sea throughout its length is nothing but a continuation ( to put the cart before the horse) of the Suez Canal. Communications between India and Europe along the shortest route, that of the Persian Gulf, have necessarily depended on the attitude of the inhabitants of the land-neck that inter venes between the Gulf and the Mediterranean, that area which Prof. Breasted so well describes as the ’’fertile crescent”, up from the land of the two rivers, across by Mosul and ancient Palmyra, and down through Syria and Palestine to Egypt. Passage through this belt from the northern approach also depended on the whim of the ho3d ers2 r ^ . 2 . 1 ^ v - &lt;! * of the Bosphorus. Thus in the Middle Ages, the Venetians, who quarrelled with the rulers of Constantinople, had to go and settle at Alexandria and Rosetta, in order to continue their eastern trade. The Genoese then succeeded to the inland caravan routes across Asia, which they held despite occasional disputes with the Seljuk Turks. Finally the capture of Constantinople ( which thenceforth became Istanbul) by the Turks, closed this door to the Christian nations of the west, anc provided the stimulus which led to the discovery of the Cape route to India. 5. As I have said, it was steam that revived the Red Sea route, and it is petrol that is swirling the balance back once nore to the overland-cum-Persian Gulf route. I will avoid obvious truisms of homenclature such as 'the transport medium of the future' and pass on to remark that the Persian Gulf route, with its land continuation across Iraq and Palestine, presents an ideal route for a predominantly coastal and maritime association^ of nations such as the British Commonwealth. It Is no accident that British Overseas Airways have for years pinned their faith on flying boats - not land planes - for the main Empire route to Australia; and it Euy be predicted that when India herself begins to operate Inter-territorial airways, she will find the flying boat best suited to a large majority of the territories surrounding the ocean which bears her name, to which she will want to run air services. 6 . The Arab shore of the Persian Gulf provides an ideal route for flying boats because of the string of enclosed lagoons and creeks which it possesses. The principal 'seadrome’' ( if I may use this hybrid word) is thut of Khcr Keliya at Bahrain, an almost entirely enclosed lagoon, 2 miles long and 1$ miles wide, the flying-boat pilots dream. Sheltered water is of course the one alighting surface which is always dead level ( for all practical purooses), and which needs no outlay on construction or maintenance. V 7. Previously, Imperial Airways used land-planes and flew down the Persian shi re of the Gulf. This had the advantage of being the inner segment of the curved coastal route from Basra to Kncski Karachi; but eventually the xenophobic policy of the late Shah of Persia made Imperial Airways* position there intolerable, and they moved, bag and baggage, to the Arab shore. Their decision was, of course, reinforced by the growing commercial importance of . that shore, with the discovery of rich oil-fields all along it. Most oil companies before the war preferred to pay air passages for their executives when going on leave or returning from it, to losing their services for the greater length of time involved in a sea passage. ( Unlike Govern ment of India employees, oil company personnel count their leave only from the date they reach their home country). Hence for many years, Bahrain was the second most profitable stop ( coming after Southampton) on the route. 8. Many a passenger has counted among his ( or her) most Sharjah fort and interesting experiences of the Orient f a night-stop in building with loopholes at the comers, which normally calls forth comparison with that popular novel ' Beau Geste'. The ttcallywa# Arab guards provided by the Shaikh of Sharjah are growing comparatively indifferent to being photographed for British or Americans albums in which, did they but know it, they undoubtedly figure either as 'Shaikhs' or as 'bedouin', neither of which of course, they are. 9. Turning now to seaways, we find rather the reverse,-3- Unloading a ship namely that the communications for the Gulf are carried on despite the badness of the anchorages for ships. Leaving aside the Shatt-el-Arab ports of Basra dn. Khaxx and Khorr- amshahr, only Muscat ( with the neighbouring town of Matrah) has a really sheltered harbour, where ships can discharge in practically all weathers. Kuwait Bay is reasonably sheltered ; but otherwise the anchorages are open road steads, where the ships have to lie from 3 to 7 miles off shore, and where the unloading of a ship into lighters may be delayed for days at a time by the winter I, shamals n - foredeck of a B.I.stormy north westers originating from the highlands of S.N. ship. Lighter along side. Anatolia. It is fair to say that the entrepot trade of the Gulf, as opposed to the direct Iraq-India trade, has been carried out despite the difficulties of delivering merchandise, rather than from the attraction of easy handling. This, however, visualises only steamer-borne goods. We must not forget that a very high percentage of India’s trade with the Gulf is carried by dhows, which can come iHxft inside to the piers or creeks which afford sheltered water. The handicap of the dhow trade lies outside the Gulf, namely the fAct that dhows cannot sail from India during the south-west monsoon. It is during this period that the Gulf’s own sailing ships stay inside its jaws, and large numbers of their crews change from sea men to pearl divers. A cable ship at work- 10. A paper on communications must not omit to mention cables and wireless. The Gull* is well provided with both of these. Bahrain in particular has a powerful wireless station, while Bushire is the post where cable communi cations from India, Great Britain and other countries are put on the Persian land-line network for Tehran and other towns. In Iraq the cables come ashore at Fao, at the mouth of the Shatt-al- Arab, and forward atxa&amp;kl«t communi cation from there is by Iraqi land line. Maintenance of cables is unfortunately a serious problem in the Gulf. The water is generally so shallow and so warm that deterioration of the insulation and protecting cover ings of the cables is rapid. Barnacles and such like creatures proliferate rapidly; and sharp edged coral rock adds to the difficulties of picking up cable for repairs. Lon^ with v^hal overload: desert back ground. 11. One specialized aspect of the Gulf’s communications must be mentioned- the pilgrim traffic. Not only is the Gulf the highway for Shia pilgrimage to the holy places of Iraq, Nejf and Kerbela; but in later years, with the improved capacity of lorries and cars to make the difficult journey across St^di Arabia, more and more pilgrim traffic for Mecca itself has passed through Kuwait and Bahrain. 12. Finally, then, we come to the strategic value to India of these methods of communication. To assess these, it is only necessary to look at the story of this war and the last. In both of these an army based on India has opera ted in Iraq. In the last war it fought an open enemy, the Turks; in this war the concealed bjit deadly weapon of the Fifth Column. After this, Persia and Iraq Force (Paiforce, as it is known) stood by as a second line to the Russian defence of the gHsksuxus Caucasus. By the grace of God the battles for the defence of India, which were fought at Stalingrad and Al Alamein, went in our favour. Had it not been so, we should certainly have seen hostile armies fighting their way towards our frontiers across the n fertile crescent” of Palestine, Syria and Iraq, and over the- -4- plateaux of Persia. How vital the Persian Gulf would then have been to us can be easily understood. Even as things were, its Persian ports, Khorramshahr, Bandar Shapur and Bushire, all formed terminals to that steady stream of war material fcr Russia which, at vastly less cost in ships and lives than the Archangel route, gave our Al41es the strength they needed for victory on Germany’s Eastern front.T.

September, 1944. Our copies hare only just come. 2. The caption where the Sheikh is described as 'Highness Majesty the Sultan the Sheikh Suleiman son of Esa the Caliph, Mighty King of Bahr&amp;in ,, is looked upon here with aaesement. It is thought unbelievable that the B.B.C. know neither the Sheikh's name, his father's name nor even the family name. As for the titles, the use of such a string of them and the addition of the tern 'Mighty King', which is applicable only to persons of the very highest rank, has been the cause of unpleasant comment at the expense of the Sheikh. The des cription of Sheikh Mubarak as uterine brother of the 'Sultan' of Bahrain, while their fathers are given ae different men, has not enhanced the reputation of the B.B.C's journal. 3. I as sending you the above brief comments as you might like to know that the matter has not passed unnoticed here.

The Film Unit, about which I have written to you, arrived unexpectedly today and as a result, I have been forced to make rather hurried arrangements. The Party have very little time in which to take the many interesting scenes which offer in Muscat and Matrah and they have therefore, skirted work immediately. They will spend some time in Muscat itself, after which they will go to Matrah and to Bait al FalaJ where I have asked Major Hirst to assist them. It would be most helpful if an official of the Muscat Government could accompany them to help in the selection and arrangement of scenes in Muscat and Matrah and also in securing the assistance and understanding of the people. Would it be possible to depute someone for this purpose ? Perhaps Mohammad Jawad of the Police would be a suitable person. If this can be arranged would you ask him to join the party as soon as he can ? Major Hirst has sent a constable to control any over-enthusiastic spectators.f I must apologis-e for having been able to give you so little warning of the time of the arrival of ^arty and hope that this has not caused you any inconvenience.

The views which he expresses are his own and expressed in his own language ; but it may be taken that they are substantially in accord with those held in British official quarters at the present time. November, 1944.1 Introduction V Some people seem inclined to picture India as a nation seething with sullen resentment against the British and hatred of them, only waiting for an opportunity to side with the Japs against its oppressors. The picture, if true, is an alarming one, since such a state of affairs is obviously a hindrance to victory over the Japanese and a danger to the lives of soldiers of the United Nations in India. It is no wonder that gazing at this distorted image, foreigners should call upon the British to do something about it. Fortunately, this is not the picture. You can divide Indians into two classes. Into the first class fall the 85 per cent, of them who live in India’s 750,000 villages and depend directly or indirectly on the land ; farmers, tenants, labourers, smiths, carpenters, weavers, cobblers, village shopkeepers, moneylenders and the like—they live “ between a crop and a crop ” and look no further. They are the unfranchised, the illiterate (but it is a j^jstake to suppose that a man is a fool because he cannot d or write), the fellows of millions of others, from iviorocco to Manchuria, to whom personal libertv means much but political freedom little, for whom patriotism2 extends to a field or a village, not to a country. No where in the world, no matter whether the country has been independent or not, have these men marched to war with flags flying and drums beating, and no one, who knew them, ever expected them to. In India they are on our side instinctively and not from ideological reasons, and their help has been invaluable. For them the Jap is an unattractive but rather shadowy figure who before the war used to sell shoddy goods ; a foreignej*^ lately become rather sinister by reason of stories of h treatment of Indian soldiers who have fallen into his hands. Now just as you get no enthusiasm in this class, so you get no “ sullen resentment ”, and certainly no ‘‘ hatred ”, except in return for material wrongs suffered or hardships inexplicably imposed ; for instance, when there is shortage of food, you may get resentment and grumbling against authority, which is ex-hypothesi, by its sins of commission or omission, responsible for the evil. For in this class there is no interest in the form of government, only in its deeds ; any government, foreign or native, which does not interfere overmuch with individual liberty, which protects a man’s life and property, which provides equality under the law, which refrains from heavy taxation, will secure acquiescence in its rule. If it can throw in, for good measure, irriga tion, railways, decent roads, education and some social services, it will win approval. This is exactly what the British in India have provided. So we can say truth fully that we rule with the consent of the ruled. On no other foot could we have stood in India so long, with British soldier to 8,000 of the population and one Bn civilian to 80,000.3 When we come to the remaining 15 per cent., we are dealing with birds of a different feather. This section includes the urban population, the literates, the elec torate, the professional and business classes, the press, the universities, the active membership of the political parties. They are, as a rule, politically conscious and nationalists. They are definitely anti-fascist; they are also often anti-imperialist. On both scores they are nti-Jap, and any suggestion that this is not so is ngrily resented even by confirmed opponents of British rule. But, though intellectually they are on our side, many of them are not sorry that we have had to travel so long in the valley of humiliation before getting a sight of victory. That is the emotional reaction to India’s internal political history. I have said that this class is nationalist; that is true in the sense that they want to govern their country themselves, but it does not follow that they all profess the same brand of nationalism. The adherent oi the Congress Party (the Hindu political machine) disagrees with the Muslim Leaguer as stoutly as he does with the British Tory. I \yould describe the state of mind of an Indian nationalist as one of soreness with everyone, including himself. He is sore with the British for he thinks we are being wilfully obstructive and he cannot shake off the suspicion of our mptives which 50 years of opposition have engendered : he is sore with the other political parties because they are so blind that they cannot see that his is the only right way : he is sore with himself because he realises quite well how J^ le his own party’s political tactics have been. Yet, ugh this diagnosis is true for thousands of educated Indians, it must never be forgotten that from this same4 class have come the ofticers for the army, the pilots, the civil servants and business men, the politicians, the tens of thousands of unknown helpers, who have worked in close co-operation with British soldiers and civil servants to produce a war effort which exceeds anything which most men of Indian experience would have believed possible five years ago. The facts prove that he who says that all is wrong in India is as big a fool as he says that all is well.Questions and Answers Question 1 : What are Britain’s intentions for India ? Did not Mr. Churchill say that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to India ? Answer : First of all, Mr. Churchill never said anything of the sort. Speaking in the House of Commons on September 9th, 1941, he said that the Atlantic Charter “ does not qualify in any way the various statements of policy which have been made from time to time about the development of constitutional government in India (The dictionary meaning of “ to qualify ” is “ to modify by any limitation or reservation, to make less strong or positive ”.) Mr. Churchill went on to explain that the principles of British policy for India already conformed to the principles of the Atlantic Charter. An examina tion of that policy, which since 1917 has been ' the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government ”, will show that this is so. In its final form, it was set out in what is known as the Cripps pro posals, which Sir Stafford Cripps, as the spokesman of the War Cabinet, announced in India on March 30th, J9 42. Briefly, the proposals are that, as soon as the is over, a constitution-making body of Indians oiiould be set up in India to frame a new constitution6 for the country. In other words, Indians have got to shoulder the task which the makers of the American constitution, for instance, shouldered 160 years ago. His Majesty’s Government undertake to accept and implement at once the constitution so framed, that is to say Parliament will divest itself of all its remaining authority over India and transfer its power to tiie self- governing Union of India. India will emerge as a free dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations ; it^^ will have, that is to say, the same position in the Commonwealth of Nations as Canada, Australia or Great Britain herself, and it will rest with Indians, as it does with Canadians or Australians, to decide whether to stay within the Commonwealth. These proposals con form completely to the words of the Atlantic Charter, ' We respect the right of all nations to choose the form of government under which they wish to live ”. There is no longer any doubt about what the British Govern ment’s policy is or that this policy has the support of the British people. There are two stages : First, India must herself make her choice of the constitution under which she wishes to live ; obviously no one else can make this choice for her. The sooner it is made the sooner can come the second stage, when Great Britain must take the necessary steps to make India completely self-governing by divesting herself of the power which she at present wields. It is obvious that Indians must make their choice before Great Britain can perform her part of the bargain^ There must be a stable government in India, accepted by the people which it is going to govern, before Grea Britain can relinquish her present responsibility for thegoverning of India. To throw down this responsibility before there is someone ready to pick it up would be a cowardly betrayal of a trust.

Can Britain really afford to give up political control of India ? What about the statement attributed to Mr. Churchill that one Britisher in every five depends on India ? Answer : It seems to be quite doubtful whether Mr. Churchill ever said anything of the kind, for, put in plain language, the suggestion means that if we gave up political control of India about nine million Britons would be in the breadline. Fortunately this is not so. Your question arises out of an impression that Britain has an enormous economic stake in India. The real position is something like this : (1) India does not pay, and never has paid, any tribute to Britain. (2) There are about fifty thousand British men, women and children in India, or one in every 940 of the population of the British Isles. ^\is probable that, whatever the new form of govern- jnt may be, most of these people will continue to live in India and to “ depend ” on India for their dailyS°l bread. (3) British pensioners of the Indian Government, i.e., people who have served in India and earned pensions, draw about six and a quarter million pounds sterling a year ; the sum is decreasing year by year. (4) India used to owe Great Britain about three hundred and seventy-five million pounds. This was money which had been borrowed by the Indian Government in London, the interest on which was payable in London in sterling. Since the war began, this debt has been wiped out. India is now a creditor instead of a debto^^ country and has accumulated credits in London o&gt; seven or eight hundred million pounds. This is the result of purchases of war material, supplies, etc., etc., made by the British Government in India since the beginning of the war. (5) There are, of course, British commercial investments in India. They are estimated to amount to something between two hundred and fifty million and three hundred and seventy-five million pounds and the interest on these investments is received by British investors. These investments, however, onlv form a small part of British overseas investments anil are much less than British investments in, &lt;?.£.,the Argen tine or Australia and, as a matter of fact, less than the amount of British investments in the tf.S.A., until these were liquidated to pay for munitions in the daj's before Lend-Lease began to operate. Britain’s chief economic interest in India is ordinary trade. Britain takes 35 per cent, of India's exports and provides 25 per cent, of India’s imports. In other words, the balance of trade is In favour of India. The Indian trade is important to Britain, but it only represent:*^ small proportion of her total trade—about 5 per cent. 8 I I t h I F v t /■N: c C c F t 1 I c s 1 t 1 t - — —/ 9 ■■■hhhbhhhhhhhhhi British imports and about 6 per cent, of British exports. It must be remembered that India controls her own tariffs and can regulate them as she pleases. She has frequently done this to the disadvantage of British trade ; for instance, the Indian tariff on cotton piece-goods has greatly decreased imports from Britain, which are now only about one-tenth of what they were thirty years ago.

Raman's “ Report on India, ^^(published in U.S.A.), pages 115 to 123, and Ministry of Information leaflet “ 50 Facts about India ”. * * * Question 3 : How do you square Mr. Churchill’s statement that he did not become the King’s First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire, with what you say is the British policy for India. Answer : You would not, would vou, expect the Prime Minister to say that it was his business to liquidate the Empire ? Neither Mr. Churchill, nor anyone else in Great Britain, has any intention of doing so. But there is no in consistency between this and our intention that India should become a fully self-governing member of the British Commonwealth. The British Empire consists of two parts, the Commonwealth and the Colonies, with India occupying an intermediate ppsition between the two. It is fully recognised that, as they develop, colonies ^^ove up from colonial status to dominion status, ^.anada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa havei moved up in this way ; India, Ceylon, Burma and Southern Rhodesia are all in process of moving up. So, when India, in accordance with this recognised process, becomes a free dominion with the right to leave the Commonwealth if she wants to, nobody regards this as “ liquidation of the Empire.” The watchword of the British Empire is not liquidation, but evolution. References: Hancock’s “Argument of Empire”^ (Penguin), published in U.S.A. as “ Empire in the Changing World,” and B.I.S. pamphlet “ British Commonwealth and Empire.” * * * Question 4 : There certainly seem to be no theoretical reasons why India should not be self-governing, but in practice, is it possible ? What have the British done to train Indians in self-government ? Have they taken any steps at all to make it possible in practice for them to carry out their promises ? Answer : The Cripps proposals were no sudden reversal of policy, no deathbed repentance by conscience-stricken imperialists. For the last eighty years, Indians have been gradually getting training and more and more experience in self-government, and at the moment, Indki is, for practical purposes, very nearly self-governing* I don’t pretend that we have been consciously groomiiij, Indians for self-government for eighty years, but in fact11 we have introduced, one by one, all the principal features of a self-governing democracy. The process started in 1861 when legislative councils of Indians were first created. Since then, the process has been a steady- one. First in 1892 the introduction of elected municipal councils and rural boards, then in 1909 the extension of the representative principle to the provincial and central legislatures, then in two stages, 1919 and 1935, the j^videning of the electorate and the introduction of government responsible to the electorate, with joint cabinet responsibility and an executive responsible to the legislature ; in fact all the things which make the British Constitution the most responsive form of democracy in the world. This process has been going on steadily with the result that thousands of Indians have served as elected representatives of the people in towns, in rural parts, in provincial and central legislatures, while large numbers have gained experience of ad ministrative responsibility. In this way the technique of self-governing democracy has become perfectly familiar to Indians. Besides that, the day' to day ad ministration of the country' is carried on by hundreds of thousands of Indian officials. At the present moment, the every-day' business of government in India is carried on almost entirely by Indians. The provinces of British India are governed by cabinets of Indians, led by Indian premiers, which are responsible to the legislatures, which again are answerable to the electorates. , In the Central Government of India, though the responsibility ^the executive has not been introduced, in fact 75 per v. at. of the departments are directed by' Indians. The orders of the various governments are carried out by a12 mmmmm corps of several hundred thousand officials of all grades of whom all, except between two and three thousand in the upper grades, are Indian. References : T. A. Raman’s “ Report on India ” (American edition), Chapter IV* ; Ministry of In formation leaflet “ 50 Facts about India * * * Question 5 : Well, your intentions seem to be honourable and^ 1 there seem to be no economic, imperial or political reasons why you should not carry them out, but why wait till after the war ? Why not do it now ? Answer : At present, India is governed by the Viceroy with the help and advice of his Executive Council, three- quarters of whom are Indians, chosen not from the great political parties but on their individual merits. The only alteration which would be possible, without making a radical change in the constitution, would be to make the Viceroy’s council completely Indian and to choose its members not from non-party men but from repre sentatives of the great Indian political parties, such as the Congress Party and the Muslim League. A proposal for a change on these lines was actually made by Sir Stafford Cripps in March, 1942, but was rejected by the Indian 'political parties. So we are driven back on some plan which does involve a change in the constitution. * T Vi » . * x. AXCX 1 I 1 U 1 A D l Ull lliuid in Chapter IV of the same author’s “ India” (published in Brit; by Oxford University Press in World Today Series). WM There are several objections to trying to change the constitution while the war is going on, two of which are obvious and decisive. In the first place, it would awaken all the animosities and rivalries between the various parties in India, which are at present put aside for the duration of the war, without any certainty of reaching the agreement which is an essential preliminary to any change. Secondly, the drawing up of a new constitution to suit four hundred million people is going to be a tremendous task. It will engage the time and thought of all the best brains in India, whether Indian or British. It is not possible to combine a 100 per cent, attention to constitution-making with 100 per cent, attention to fighting the war, and either task demands nothing less than 100 per cent, attention. Any attempt to do so would undoubtedly make India a less efficient base for operations against Japan. So, though a certain amount of preparatory spadework could be done during the war, if the leaders of the Indian parties would agree to make a start, the main business must be postponed till the war is won. References: Coupland’s “ Cripps Mission”; Raman (American edition), p. 177 et seq. * * * Question 6 : Well, what about after the war ? You British all talk a lot about Indian differences. What are they ? ''‘'Has your ” divide-and-rule policy ” not fostered them and are you not really relying on them to keep control in your own hands ? 1314 A nswer : I he differences between Hindus and Muslims are much older than British rule. They have become more acute, as anyone can observe, as it has become more clear that the British intend to hand over power to Indians. The struggle has become essentially one for power, between the Indian parties. There is nothing surprising in this. Compare the rivalry for the empty chair which springs up between the junior partners in a firm, vhertA the senior partner announces his intention of retiring. Now as far as religion and customs are concerned, there is no reason why Hindus and Mohammedans should not live together peacefully in the same village, in the same town and under the same government. For the most part, they do so now. The real trouble is the close connection in a modern society between political and economic power. The political position is this : there are three Hindus to every Muslim, and in elections a Hindu votes for a Hindu and a Muslim for a Muslim. 1 his means that under the simple form of democracy, where things are decided by the counting of heads, the Hindus have a permanent majority and there is no chance of the Muslim minority changing itself into a majority. Imagine what the position would be, for instance, if one of the great British or American parties was in a permanent minority. The economic position is this : there are not only more Hindus than Muslims, but in proportion to their numbers there are more Hindus who aic educated and well-to-do than there are Muslim^^ and Hindus to a large extent dominate business, corr^ merce, trade, banking, money-lending 1 , etc. Now, as15 long as the British hold the political power, things are not too bad for the iCluslims ; they have a chance to make up lost economic ground by free competition, which they are beginning to take, and the British are impartial and can be relied upon to prevent the passing of discrimi natory legislation and to see that the Muslims have their fair share in government appointments, and so on. But the British are going and the Muslims are faced with a Hindu demand for ' one India,” which means permanent Hindu political domination, and therefore, so the Muslims fear, the freezing for ever of the existing economic position. The Muslim reaction to this is to demand two Indias, one Hindu, one Muslim, Hindustan and Pakistan, completely independent of each other. Put in this extreme way, the two positions are quite irrecon cilable ; if you accept the one, you must reject the other. The political problem is to find a compromise between these two positions, which will enable Muslims to feel safe from any risk of domination by the other community and give them freedom to develop along their own lines, while at the same time they can join with Hindus in preserving and building up a united and prosperous India. To the outsider some form of federalism with a large degree of ” States rights ” for the component units seems the obvious solution. But it cannot be said too often that it is for Indians to decide what solution they want ; no one else can decide for them. Still less can anyone force the parties to accept a decision to which they do not agree or prevent them from reaching i agreement, if they want one. The charge that the British intend to make Hindu- Muslim differences an excuse for retaining control isReferences : B.I.S. Leaflet “ India's Right to Free dom ; Coupland’s “ Cripps Mission ” ; Raiagopala^k chariar’s “ The Way Out.” * * * Question 7 : Let us assume that Hindus and Muslims will come to some agreement. Have not the British still got a card up their sleeve in the Indian Princes ? These oppressive anachronisms were created by the British and are under their control. Are they to be used to block India’s progress to freedom ? A nswer : 1 he Indian native states, often called Indian India to distinguish it from British India, are not creations of the British. Some of them have existed for a thousand years or more ; most of the rest came into being during the 18th century after the break-up of the Mogul Empire and before the British gained control over India. Individually they vary in size from large states, like Hyderabad which is as big as Kansas, to small estate no larger than a plantation ; collectively they compr*^^ two fifths of the total area of India and about a quarter of the population.17 mmrnm In early days the British followed the policy of absorb ing the native states into British India, as opportunity offered. This phase came to an end in 1858, when the rulers were solemnly guaranteed against further annexa tion by Queen Victoria’s famous proclamation. There is no difference between the people of British India and the people of Indian India in race, religion, customs or general way of life. The difference is (a) the people of '^Indian India are not British subjects but the subjects of the native ruler ; (b) they are governed by hereditary native Princes, not by the British Crown and Parliament. The relations between Britain and Indian India are regulated by treaties concluded between the Crown and each native ruler individually. Subject to the right of the Crown to interfere in cases of gross misgovernment,. the ruler is independent in the internal affairs of his State. He is protected by the Crown from external aggression and in return gives up the right of entering into independent relations with foreign powers or other Indian states. The representative of the Crown in India for matters connected with the States is not the Govern ment of India, but the Viceroy in his personal capacity. The form of government in the states is always personal rule but there are differences in the extent to which the ruler keeps the administration in his own hands. Prac tically all the more important Princes govern to a large extent through ministers who are often experienced administrators trained in British India ; several Princes ijave set up some form of popular assembly the function ^ which is advisory and sometimes even legislative. The Jiciency of the administration varies. In some states (e.g., Mysore, Travancore, Baroda) it is notably pro- b*(21533) 38455/P160 1,350 12 +4 K.H.K. Gp. 445 gressive and efficient. It is untrue and unfair to stigma tise the government of the Indian Princes, as a class, as oppressive. It would be equally untrue to describe it as democratic ; it is the traditional autocracy of the East, of which the government of Ibn Saud in Saudi Arabia is perhaps the most notable surviving example outside India. There is little to show that the people who live under this form of government wish to exchange it for the American, British or any other pattern of democracy About twelve years ago the first suggestion for an Indian Federation, to include both British and Indian India, came from the Princes. The result of this was the inclusion in the Government of India Act of 1935 of provision for the establishment of a Federation of India. There is no reason to believe that, given adequate safe guards against interference in the internal affairs of their states, the Princes would be unwilling to join in a Union of India, as envisaged in the Cripps proposals. The problem is to devise a federal constitution into the pattern of which the Princes will be ready to fit them selves. This is not the least formidable of the tasks which confront Indian statesmanship. Britain is on record as wishing to encourage such a development and her good offices will be available, but any unilateral denunciation of existing treaties against the wishes of the Princes would lay her open to a grave charge of bad faith.

'A few day* ago Mr, Christopher Holme, our Public Information Officer in Jerusalem, who waa on a vi*it to England, gave this Division an infernal talk on the set-up in Palestine and the task of publicity in that country. Notes of tne talk were made at the tiuie.

GIVEN ON MARCH 13, 1945. The status of the Public Information Officer of Palestine probably differs slightly from that of the Ministry of Inform ation officers in other overseas posts. The Public Inform ation Office is an integral part of the Secretarial of the Palestine Government. Palestine has had a Public Information Officer since 1936, previously to that there had been a Press Officer for some years. Early in 1939 an officer was appoint ed as assistant to the P.I.O. for the specific purpose of counter-propaganda. The new appaintraent was made as the result of a meeting at which the War Office and Foreign Office, as well as the Colonial Office, were represented. I believe it was probably the first case of an officer being appointed to a British administration overseas, during the H sub war M period, for the specific purpose of counter propaganda. The aim of the activities then set on foot by the Palestine Government in co-operation with the military authorities of Palestine may be summarised as an attempt to wean the Arab population away from the Axis. The large majority of politi cally conscious Arabs were at that time pro-Axis$ they looked upon Britain as the sponsor of Jewish immigration, and there fore their enemy. I should like to emphasise that the Arab conflict with the Jews is not basically religious, though that may sometimes appear as an irritant; indigenous communities such as the Yemanite Jews have always been tolerated by the Arabs. The objection is to the penetration of the country by European immigrants, an objection based on fear - fear of the European Jews 1 superior skill, higher culture, and greater power of economic organisation. Fear drives to desperation; and it was desperation, allied to poverty and under-employment, that drove the Arabs into the hills. It was part of our news policy to represent the many Arabs who took active part in the rebellion at that time as dandlts. Some of them probably were, but a good proportion were intellectuals, inspired * by a genuine if misguided, Idealism. On the outbreak of war with Germany in 1939, the rebellion was called off, possibly on an order from Baghdad. The reasons for such an order were probably that the Mufti*s advisers told him, first, that the rebellion had been militarily crushed, as it certainly had been; second, that the British Government^®* *k4e d4££4euj White Paper policy was at least in part a satis faction of the Arab claims; and lastly, that to declare loyalty to the British Government at this difficult time might be a wise move and store up Arab credit for the future. Whatever the exact reasons, the rebellion was called off; but this did not mean a complete change of heart on the part of the Arab leaders, who remained exceedingly reserved. Publicity*s job was to convert an audience not only hostile but ■ unwilling to listen. All information from British sources was suspect, so that much resistance had to be broken down before propaganda could take any effect. I think we may have started with the idea that propaganda was something you manufactured, and handed out, and then watched it take effect. In practice /It was.....■■■■■■■ it was not quite as simple as that* First an audience had to bo created, and to do this the first measures taken were restrictive♦ A drastic press censorship *as imposed; and this on the whole was welcomed b/ the Arabic press, since the pre vious practice of suspending a newspaper only after it had offended left them open to terrorist pressure. The Jewish press was rather less pleased with the censorship, but accepted it as a necessity at this time. The result of this censorship, which was impartially applied to the whole press, uus virtually to ban political polemics in Palestine newspapers for S&amp; years. The next task of the Public Information Officer, and his staff war. to help re-establish personal contacts. Since the rebellion, even the simpler administrative contacts had lapsed; when jrhese were restored - as gradually they were - the work of propaganda became easier. I must point out that in tnis instance the P.I.Q. was only carrying out the policy of the Administration, to whera credit for the restoration of these personal contacts should chiefly belong. I think the results of our influencing of Arab public opinion in Palestine may be looked upon as successful. We had to contend with various elements likely to have an unsett ling effect on the public mindi there was the Rashid All rebellion In Iraq and the focus of infection represented by the Vichy French in Syria. British forces were numerically weak, and for some time there was the direct threat to Palestine by the Axis armies through Egypt. In spite of all this, it is true to say that during the war y&lt;?ars there has been no important deterioration in public security due to Arabs. (Banditry and robbery with violence, which are endemic in Palestine, sank to rather below their usual level). In my view, the credit for this saAiafeeto* satisfactory state of affairs can be given tos 1. The White Paper policy. 2. The presence of military force, improved police methods and censorship. 3. Progressive expansion and improvement of administrative services. 4. Economic revival due to the war* 5. Propaganda. I must say something about the actual working of the Public Information Office. It is housed separately from the Secretariat, of which it is a part, and has greatly expanded since 1939. The staff now numbers about 100, which brings the Public Information Office about to the level of a Palestine Government Dep&amp;rtiaent. It acts also, of course, as the Palestine Office of the Ministry of Information, which bears much of the expenditure. As an example of 'Ministry 4 * activity, it is worth mentioning that audiences for M.O.I. films in Palestine are closely comparable in numbers to those in Egypt, to which they are next in order of importance. This is because Palestine Is a country organised on European lines; large sections of the population have their eves turned towards Europe, and this applies in some degree to the Arabs as well as the Jews. The fact that the Public Information Office is a department of the/--3- 'I ^ &amp; V *4 r* of the Palestine government and that Palestine is a British administered country, means that certain adjustments have to be made. In a foreign country, where the Publldty Officer is attached to the British diplomatic mission, It may be g ^d propaganda to make a splash} In PeeePalestlne this may have to be ^voided, and the Public Information Office has to tsovc in step with ot/ier Government departments. This proper regard for economy has to be reconciled with the efficient performance of Information work, of which, by virture of being e Government Departnent, the P.1.0, is probably expected to undertake rather more than any other Posts, The work has to be performed with due regard to the functions of other Departmental liaison also has to be maintained with the British Council, All this sounds rather compllcted, but in actual practice It works out quite easily, mostly in terras of personal contacts. One of the most important Jobe of the Public Information Office was and is to organise contacts between the people of the country and their Government, One of the beat media for this is the monthly press conference given by the Chief Secretary, and organised by the P.1.0, The Chief Secretary answers questions put to him by represent atives of the Arabic and Jewish press; aajor political Questions are barred, but grievances can be aired, which is most valuable and important in a country without a Parliament, The Public Information Officer holds weekly press conferences, and also organlSeg contacts between press representatives and heads of Government Departments, The F.I.O, sends a representative to the race tings of the War Keonoalc Advisory council. This officer takes the minutes, and where security considerations do not intervene, prepares a report for the press, I would like to say something about the present condition of the Palestine Arabs, They must not bo thought of as Beduln; there are some Beduln, but the mass of the Arabs are peasant cultivators. Although land In Palestine is poorer than in Egypt, they are probably better off than the Egyptian fellahin. This is because they are better protected by law and looked after by the Administration, 3everthelass, like most peasant cultivators, they live under the shadow or debt. The agricultural economy of Palestine is on the Medit€ rranean pattern, which, means living on a very narrow margin. If crops are bad, the peasantry have nothing with which to buy necessities or seed for their next crop, and so they borrow, which means lAvAsg-ea-a— that two bad years running may leave then* in debt, British Mandatory Government has done a good deal to alleviate this of affaire; one important measure has been the conversion of tonmr communal vlllahe holdings into small holdings, A communal system of land tenure sounds very progressive, but in practice it meant the impoverishment of the land and consequently of the peasantry, Each family cultivated a strip of land for one year in turn, and then moved on to the next strip* as in the Mad Hatter 1 a tea party. Tin*re was no incentive to put capital improvements v into the/into tho land. During the war Uie scarcltv or agricultural inporta, and the darmnd for labour on nilitcry wcrka, have neant a period of considerable prosperity for the fellahin, and this has been a factor in internal security. Literacy aaonc Palestinian Arabs is higher than in Egypt or in Syria. Under the Mandat*, a good percentage of Arabs get education up t^a standard high for the Middle East; they also get instruction in / improved methods of agriculture, in Government schools, of which, however, there are not nearly enough. Here la probably the right point to say that, In considering expansion of any information activities in Palestine, the claims on available manpower of other Government services, as, for Instance, education, have to be borne in mind. I mention education because Information work cannot, in my view, be divorced from it. Xo sun up, the Arab's attitude to the Palestine problem is not governed by primarily racial cr religious consider ations. His attitude Is that of any native people to foreign immigrants. He had no anti-Jew prejudice before 1922. We mast rener^ber that the Palestine problem is one we ourselves have created, primarily for idealistic reasons. The Zionist argunont that m support the Jewish national Homs only fron imperialistic Motives, because we want to maintain our influence in countries adjacent to the Sues Canal sons can, I think, be dismissed. 3s shall obviously keep our footing In the Canal senu. Zionism or no Zionism, so long aa w© are a great power. Ths argument takes no account of the Zionist idea, which, after developing among British Christians ss well aa Jews for 60 years or so, finally found expreaslAn in the Balfour Declaration. Jewish immigration into Palestine has come in waves. The earliest cane mainly from Hassle. The Social-Democrat and nationalist Ideology of these early Russian Jewish immigrants was from the start in conflict with Russian Co^rotunisn, a conflict which has persisted to this day. Ifext ca&amp;e waves of Polish Jews* and with the beginning of tho Hitler persecution a new type of immigrant began to arrive, the first to be displaced by persoeutlon were naturally those with the fewst roots, ueatly from the fringes of Jfasi expansion. At first those Geroana who wore politically exposed and so had to leave their homos, mostly chose to go to the western states or to Russlarf* hany of those who went to Palestine, being people easy to displace, were perhaps of a type which a discriminating Government, solicitous for the welfare of the country, ftlght class aa undesirable. Parallel with this however, there was a acceleration of xxxaifleaijt specifically Zionist ircaigratlon, mostly young people who had accepted pioneer training - in England or other countries of origin - and were placed in agricultural settlements. The original ideal of Zionisx was settled on the*land, In communities; but even Zionists have to admit that this Ideal !ias not boon fully attained. Of the 600,000 Jews now la Palestine, only 3C# are settled on the land; and it is worth notiiig that 180,000 live in Tel Aviv, Many of them in what can only be described as slun conditions. It has now becone the official view of the Zionist leaders that Palestine nast be industrialised. It has bocome plain that settlement on the land will not provide for the 'millions' whom the Zionists now talk of D*4ii4ft4«4«t bringing in; the only answer must be Industrialisation; which has, or. course, been given an enoroous stimulus by the war. The war in fact brought Palestine industry to life; to the great benefit of the Jewish inhabitants, who found outlets for their special skllla and talen for economic organisation. The war/-5- The war has reganaratad tha economic but not the cultural life of Palastlna. It brought a wave of M last-^eao^t ,, immigrants - Jaws who cama to Palestlna because they could not go anywhere else. They have naturally not settled hapylly? they feel frustrated* Frustration In fact is at the root of the moral side of tha Palest ine problem. It weighs heavily on both Jaws and Arabs, who see all Government posts of any inportanae, and all effestive polities! power, ^is in the hands of 'aliens'. This^/nobody’a fault; the cause brings us back to tha basic problem created by two conflicting populations, nei ther of which car be expected to eupply officers who will be loyal to anything but their own community. It is in fact the better type both of Jew and Arab who feels this community loyalty most strongly. Jews from £urcpe suffer from an extra sense of frustration due to living in a small restricted community, which puts a deadening limit to the deg ree of distinction which can be attained by any individual; this is particularly stifling to the artist. This state of affairs is of course, inevitable in any' sruili nationalistic state. It is necessary to ao&amp;sthln&amp; about terrorise. It is of course a manifestation of which came late to Palestine, which like most small nationalistic countries has developed late politically. Enrolment in one of the several terrorist organisations is am outlet for the Jewish youths Tfoo find the training provided by the Hagans, (the para-military organisation sponsored by the Jewish Agency; too ^tame for them. I should say that roughly 1 in 20 of the rising gen eration of Jews was a potential Candidato for a terrorist organisation. The dissipation of this feeling of frustration should be a principal aim of our work; but until the Government declares a policy for the f future of Palestine, we can do very little in this direction. What we can end are doing, however, is to try to convince the people of Palestine that membership of the British Commonwealth of Rations is a fine and desirable thing; that it must be to the advantage of any countyy to join this Commonwealth, whether as a full member or as an associate, like for instance Iraq. We mst convince the Palestinians that the time has passed when we exploited the world for our benefit - if there ever was such a time it ended about 1900; our aim new is to develop from existing institutions a peaceful world in which our Ideals of democracy and tolerance can be applied. Before we set out to sell our ideal of democracy to Jews and Arabs, it is as well to clear our minds as to what the word *ean.j to us; and also to remember that our whole conception of democracy must be alien to these Eastern peoples, whose hidtory is sc different from our own. They have had no long period in which to develop toleration in living together* When am an Arab now says 'I am in favour of democracy' he really maans 'I accept your ideas since you are winning the war and I wish to stand well with you'. The next generation m&amp;y come to understand the meaning of the word democracy, which at present is not much more then a convenient label. Miss Sarrell asked whether those Jews who had a nostalgia for Bur- ope ancT KadT Tailed to settle down in Palestine would be likely to go elsewhere after the war. Answer i They will certainly wish to leave Palcstins but It is un- likely that they will be able to do so. Europe will be so disorgan ised that they will probably wish to go to England or the U.8., and it is improbable that they will be allowed to do so. Much depends on what news reaches them from their former homes. Mr. Grav*^ asked whether the Palestine Government kept the P.Ifi. ♦INFORMED OF POLICY DECISIONS, so that publicity could be closely re lated to Government policy.

E. GENERAL SIR CLAUDE AUCHINLECK C.-IN-C., INDIA. As you know Allied pressure against Japan is growing rapidly and we can con fidently hope that this will continue until our victory is final and complete. The essence of success in war is to sur prise your enemy, to confront him with the unexpected. This is a maxim as old as war itself. To gain surprise, secrecy as to our intentions is essential. India is one of the main bases of the Allied Nations in this struggle against Japan. Every one of us in India, whatever our station or occupation, has a great respon sibility in this matter of security, namely, the prevention of information regarding ournlans and preparations reaching the ene^^. We must have complete security ; no^ a half-hearted happy-go lucky sort of ^^ecurity but the real thing. I have been given, in addition to my other duties, the tremendous task of safeguarding the security of operations based on India for the defeat of the Japanese. I rely on all of you, therefore, to play your part in this great effort as you have never played it before—that is, to re double your efforts to achieve complete security in this country. There is no room for mistakes, carelessness or forget fulness. The enemy must be denied all means of obtaining information about our war effort in India, our troop movements, our pre parations and plans. 'ot only is this essential to secure the speedy as well as the complete defeat of the Japanese but also to ensure that this object is achieved with the minimum of to our sailors, soldiers and airmen ^to . -iom we owe our preservation from the tyranny of our enemies. 1 WHAT IS SECURITY ? There is a tendency to speak of Security in warfare as if it were a timorous expres sion of a “ safety first ” policy, a niggling affair of counting the cost, a dull and nega tive attitude responsible for gibes about “ phoney wars ” and “ too little and too late ”. is nothing of the kind, and it is highly important in Security Education to see that all such impressions are corrected. Security is an active and vital part of the job of winning the war—not only of winning it as quickly as possible and with a minimum loss of human life but of win ning it at all. A good way of explaining and illustrat ing this is to divide the elaborate business of achieving victory and peace into three “ wars within wars ”, each of which can be understood as having its own problems, perils and labours, though all of them are interlocked as indispensable parts of the supreme task. These three wars are : (1) The Shooting War : The Battle for Victory in the Field. (2) The Production War : The Battle for Supphes and Material. (3) The Intelligence War: The Battle for Information. The Shooting War is the war we chiefly read about in the newspapers. It covers all operations by land, air and sea. It consists of the enemy’s phj'sical attempts to get at us and destroy us, whe ther by bombardment or direct invasion ; and of our own military blows against the enemy in defence of our territory and com munications and in fulfilment of the basic essential of victory—the destruction of the enemy’s power to fight. In all countries ordinary civilians have left their homes and families and occupations and gone forth in vast numbers to take part in the Shooting War. In very many countries war in all its violence has oome close to the domestic hearth, and even those civilians who have not taken up arms and donned uniforms have been in the thick of the Shooting War. But in India we have for the most part been successful in keeping the Shooting War beyond our frontiers. It is still, for the great majority of peaceable people something separate and distant, heard about and talked about but never experienced in its naked impact. r- The Production War employs enormous numbers of people in the vital business of victory, and its importance is now pretty generally appreciated. We know how the Germans organised the entire productive capacity of occupied Europe to keep their Shooting War going ; how the British workers not only recovered from the disas ter of Dunkirk but survived the enemy’s bombing to turn out supplies for Russia and for the return to the Continent ; how the Russians mobilized emergency pro duction behind the Ural mountains ; and how the Japanese liave slowly but surely been losing the vital race with the American factories and shipyards. In India especially2 we expect our participation in the Pro duction War to have considerable effects on our post-war economy. The Intelligence War, though less well understood, is no less important than the Shooting War and the Production War. Intelligence covers the collection of information about the enemy and the frus tration of the enemy’s efforts to collect in formation about us. It is an exciting busi ness, many more people than one would imagine are employed in it and it is going on all the time. We hear much about strategy and plan ning, from the conferences of Allied leaders at Quebec and Casablanca, Cairo and Teheran, down to the tactical plans on the spot which so often spell success or failure for an operation. None of this strategy and planning which has carried us so far towards victory, could be conducted without re liable information on a great number of matters which can build up for the planners as accurate a picture as possible of the situa tion to be dealt with, of the enemy’s re sources, of the way he intends to use them, and of his probable reactions to what we propose to do. The great Duke of Wellington once said that he could win every battle if he knew what was going on at the other side of the hill. Translated into the huge complications of modem global warfare, that is as true today as it ever was. Intelligence and Security We can now see what these rather mysterious jobs of Intelligence and Security amount to. Intelligence collects information about the enemy. Security prevents the enemy from col lecting information about ourselves. The enemy himself is of course equally appreciative of the importance of the Battle for Information. He too knows what Intelligence is and what Security is. It is precisely because he relies upon Intelli gence that we have to rely upon Security. The greater his efforts and capacities in the field of Intelligence, the greater must be our measures to defeat him in the field of Security. And there is no doubt that in matters of Military Intelligence both the Germans and the Japanese are ingenious, practised and determined. Their Intelligence offensive is elaborate and continuous, and cannot be defeated by half-hearted or haphazard methods of Security. Between our own Intelligence and our own Security, the two complementary activities in the Battle for Information, there is a distinction which concerns us. Intelligence is the business of professional experts, trained specialists whose work does not come before the public eye, though its results may later be read in newspaper headlines. Sometimes a member of the public may chance upon valuable information and report it to the nearest authority, whence it may reach the Intelligence staff. But this does not often happen. Security is also in the hands of officers selected and trained for the purpose. But the big difference is that here the public does play a very l irge and a vitally important part. The date and place of a forthcoming offensive are closely-guarded secrets known only to a few men at the very top. The sailing of a convoy or the building of a new airfield are not reported in the news papers. Nevertheless, in every activity of war, and in the multifarious prepa^ 'ons leading to it, there are scraps of information necessarily known to thousands of people who have their own work to do, or wh^^ come into daily contact with others win are directly or indirectly engaged on some part of the vast and complicated business. Enemy agents have not much hope of concealing themselves under Mr. Chur chill’s chair or of breaking into the war-room at the Kremlin. They, therefore, largely concentrate their efforts on the acquisition, from innocently gullible sources, of tiny morsels of information that can be pieced together by their Intelligence experts to give them what they so badly need. That is why Security becomes the busi ness of each member of the public. Security Education aims to bring this home to the private citizen so thoroughly that en&lt;jjj^y Intelligence may find no chinks in armour. 2 W THE CIVILIAN’S PART In the Shooting War large numbers of men who are normally civilians are daily and hourly risking their lives. In the Pro duction War a huge civilian labour force is constantly employed. But the In telligence War, or that part of it which has been explained as Security, implicates not merely many but all civilians. The peasant who has happened to watch a convoy of lofries bumping along a country road, the coolie who has carried baskets of earth for an airfield, the fisherman who has seen unusual offshore lights, the casual railway passenger whose train has had to wait to let a troop-i^m through, the wife or daughter of a CT^-k in a shipping office, are all concerned just as much as the highly paid Government official, or the big military contractor.3 Security Education, therefore, has to reach everybody. Certain particularly important targets in the drive for Security can, however, be distinguished. They may be classed broadly in both geographical and occupational categories. The areas in which Security Education js of the greatest importance at the present time are the following: (A) Calcutta-Bengal-Assam. —This re presents the present front-line civilian Security. Information of military value to the enemy is more abundant, more important, and on the face of it easier to obtain here than anywhere else. It is more abundant because of the vast and varied military activities proceeding in these areas ; it is ^Ve xmpjrtant because the enemy’s most immediate need is to know in advance as much as possible about the offen sive operations now being directed against m in Burma; it is easier to obtain oecause on the Burma front the Japanese are in direct contact with us. Wherever fighting is taking place, and especially across country as wild as that on the borders of India and Burma, agents can make their way from one side to the other and return with information. You cannot seal off a land frontier which is changing every day. This area, moreover, is subject to the enemy’s air reconnaissance, and it is highly important not to allow the results of such reconnaissance to be supplemented or interpreted by leakages of information. (B) Bombay-Karachi-Madras-Cochin-Viza' ga|d^am.—These, with Calcutta mentioned alT \ are India’s chief ports, and in every country dock areas are the enemy agent’s favourite resort. Information leading to the detection of shipping movements (and it woul^^irprise many people to know what ap- ^^ren^y trivial hints can lead to this know- xcdge) is valuable to the enemy and dan gerous to ourselves for two reasons. In the first place it may lead, and often has led, to the destruction of shipping by enemy action, with loss of tonnage, cargo and human lives. In the second place even if the enemy is not immediately in a posi tion to take advantage of the information by intercepting a convoy, he wants to know every day and every hour what sort of materials or men, and in what quantity, are safely reaching our ports. It is this information which gives him the framework for the detailed picture of our offensive plans and preparations which his Intelligence Staff is paid to produce. above remarks refer primarily to tlu. xnovements of merchant-vessels and transports and to all related business in port areas. The casting of a security net around naval affairs is of course equally important. Initially it is the responsi bility of the naval authorities themselves, and they are working hard at it. Never, theless civilians are implicated here as everywhere else in the vital task of Security. Civilian labour, and the relatives and friends of naval personnel, offer obvious temptations to the enemy agent starving for informa tion. (C) Delhi-Meerut-Simla Areas.— A tip “ straight from the horse’s mouth ” is traditionally preferred to any other. Though it is wrong to suppose that the enemy models his activities exclusively on popular fiction, sending seductive females to ex tract secret documents from the pockets of highly-placed but susceptible officers, it is easy to understand that civil and mili tary headquarters, with their thousands of employees, files, telephones and waste- paper baskets, are capable of yielding much to a quick-witted agent if Security is not fully understood and rigorously observed. Additional factors of which enemy Intelligence might be expected to take note are (i) that Government officers and employees are constantly moving on duty by rail between Delhi and Simla, and (ii) that a shortage of office and re sidential accommodation in civil and mili tary headquarters areas may, if the proper care be not taken, encourage makeshift and inadequate Security arrangements. (D) Quetta and Peshawax, with communi cations with Kabul. —If this war had followed the patterns laid down by history, the North- West Frontier would have been found at the head of our list of areas where special inten sity is required in Security Education. The shifting of the balance of India’s defence from North-West to North-East has been a tremendous undertaking, successfully ac complished in time to thwart the ‘‘ Victory March to Delhi ” trumpeted so loudly by Japanese propaganda. Nevertheless, Quetta and Peshawar areas have a very significant importance in Security, and for this reason : India is bordered on the North- West by a neutral, independent state, Afghanistan. Under the protection of in ternational law there are enemy legations in Kabul, with considerable staffs of enemy officials ; and it is easy to guess that one of the principal tasks of these officials at the present juncture is to collect information of military importance and forward it to Tokyo or Berlin. Information leaving India via the North-West Frontier is thus taking a short and comparatively easy road to the enemy headquarters ; and unless Secu rity is at a high pitch of efficiency on our side of this rugged area, agents can pass backwards and forwards with impunity. It is not the ordinary civilian’s business to track down spies. But it ts his business to starve spies of information.4 That is everyone’s business, whoever and wherever he (or she) may be. Some people, however, have at the same time more access to information than others, and more opportunities of carelessly dis closing it. These are the people whom the enemy agent searches out, whose strength and weakness in Security matters he is trained to recognise. The more important of these occupational categories may be described as follows : (1) Government servants, employees of shipping and other mercantile firms, oil companies and banks. —Whether at headquarters or throughout the country, and particularly in the “ danger areas ” mentioned above. Central, Provincial and local government servants have a very special responsibility in Security matters. Habit and familiarity may easily dull this sense of responsibility, and it is the task of Security Education to provide constant reminders of it. “ Employees of shipping and other mer cantile firms ” is, intentionally, a very broad phrase. The numbers and variety of those engaged directly or indirectly in the business of shipping and supply is greater than might be imagined. Not only dock labour (dealt with below) and the employees of shipping firms have access to information which, even if fragmentary, can play its part in a sequence leading to the premature disclosure of an operation or perhaps to the destruction of important civil supplies. Banks, insurance companies and many trading firms and agencies with large staffs are interested at some point in their business in the movements of ships. Beyond this, private citizens often have enquiries to make on their own account and although the information officially per mitted to be supplied to them is designed to prevent breaches of Security, there is human temptation to seek other sources of information and perhaps to disclose it thereafter in an unguarded conversation or in a letter which escapes censorship. The caution about principals and em ployees of Oil companies speaks for itself. Oil is one of the chief sinews of war. We use our own knowledge of movements and stocks of oil in enemy-controlled territory as an important pointer to enemy strength and probable activity. The enemy Intelli gence Staff endeavours to do exactly the same thing about us, and their agents are paid to discover the necessary facts. (2) Railway employees. —The railways of India and their staffs have stood a tremen dous strain during the war and the period of stress and difficulty is very far from being over. But the strain on Security has hitherto received less notice than the strain on rolling-stock and wagon- space. The physical safety of passengers and goods on the railways is at all times dependent upon signalling-systems and other precautionary devices which are expected to be absolutely fool-proof. A railway accident, if it occurs, is at once the subject of searching investigation, and sometimes the enquiry is taken as far as the Legislative Assembly. The whole chain from traffic managers down to the man whom we watch tapping the wheels at station-halts, is scrutinised regularly to eradicate the weak links that might lead to a breakage. No less .stringent pre cautions are needed to ensure the Security of military information at this vital phase of the war, and every class of railway employee is at some time or anojijpr in possession of information which col 'help the enemy. As in other professions, familiarity witL one’s daily work is a danger among railwt employees that easily leads to indiscretions in talk or correspondence. On the other hand, Security Education in this category has something useful to work on in the “ safety psychology ” which the training and daily experience of a railwayman ought logically to produce. (3) Industrial and dock labourers. —The Indian workman has a high reputation for efficiency under trying conditions. But there are three facts about industrial and dock labour in India which no one can deny. It is comparatively ill-paid, it is largely uneducated and by foreign standards it is poorly organised. A low stai’^’rd of living offers the enemy agent (\. -*o, be it remembered, is not likely to be re cognised for what he is) opportunities of buying the information he se^jjg. A low standard of education impos ob^ tacles in the way of a convincing explan, tion of Security requirements. A low standard of organisation means that the labourers, who are in many cases migratory, are often difficult to “ get at ” in the Edu cational sense ; and at the same time it may facilitate impersonation and other enemy devices to outwit Security. Yet the importance of industrial and dock labour in the pattern of military Security is obviously very great. Political associa tions should be of assistance in Security Education among labour if they are ap proached sensibly and tactfully. To be sure of labour in a Security sense, however, one must first be sure of employers and contractors. The initial contact sh^jfjd, therefore, be with the heads of firns** m whom lies the moral if not the legal responsibility for any breach of Security by workmen under their control.5 (4) Club Members. —Where two or three are gathered together, the reddest of warn ing lights should flash. Experience has shown that almost no-one, rich or poor, Indian or European, civilian or military, is absolutely proof against the temptation to talk injudiciously in his hours of social relaxation. If is in clubs and bars that Security patrols have found most to record— and here it may be noted that the warning “ Security Patrols are Listening ” may in some cases be found more salutary than the attempt to convince club members that “ The Enemy is Listening ”. There are innumerably different kinds of clubs, from large Planters’ Clubs and Gymkhanas to Railwaymen’s Institu tes and small associations where people of a common profession, religion, sport, hobl^ or provincial origin get together in jir leisure hours. The availability of alcohol—even of war time alcohol— ^ds commonly regarded as a contributory ^^ause of the loosening of tongues ; and this is doubtless so. But that does not mean that “ dry ” clubs of which there are so many are safe from breaches of Security : far from it. Every club maintains a list of members', who can with the secretary’s collaboration be circularised in their own language on the subject of Security. Most club pre mises are suitable for the display of posters, stickers and similar devices calling attention to Security needs. Two things to remember are (a) that there are club servants about the pia e as well as members ; and (b) that although the actual communication of information to an enemy agent may j/' '*.aps not take-place within the club, the cfiain of news that finally reaches him may very well start there. ({^■■Travellers. —This cotegory clearly ^^ove,^ every class of citizen, for despite ‘ Travel Less ” campaigns nearly every one is a passenger at some time on train or bus ; and it is in trains and buses that reserve before strangers traditionally breaks down. In order to influence people along sound Security lines when they become travellers, the railway authorities display notices in carriages, and posters are shown on station-hoardings. Less has been done for the country bus routes, and here local initiative has plenty of opportunity. No body can operate a bus service without frequent contacts with authority in connection with licenses, petrol supplies and inspection of vehicles, and these con tacts can be utilised for conducting Secu- r^^ Education campaigns. Although comparatively few civilians— and those mostly officials—travel by air in war-time, a special word of warning is needed on this subject. Flying is still sufficiently unfamiliar to most people to produce a most improper tendency to chatter about the experience. Few people after a railway-journey describe to the first casual acquaintance the type and performance of the locomotive and other technical details of the trip. Yet even highly-placed executives find flying- jargon a dangerously attractive novelty, and cannot resist the temptation to air their knowledge of aircraft and airfields. (6) Hotel residents, management and staff. —Many of the remarks on club members apply also to hotel visitors and staff, with this important difference—that hotel re sidents are birds of passage. They have to register, and the police pay special attention to hotels. But that only means that a breach of Security can in many cases be followed up after it has been committed, with unpleasant con sequences to the offender. It is the pre- vention of crime that Security Education seeks to effect. The punishment is in other hands. And the punishment cannot re call the word that has started on its journey to enemy headquarters. It can at most, by example, prevent later information from taking the same disastrous route. Until recently, as travellers abroad must have noticed, publicity for Security was very much more evident in hotels in the Middle Eastern countries than in India. The happy hunting-ground for enemy agents has now, for obvious reasons, shifted East. Security Education must catch up with them ; and no hotel, of whatever class, should be without its warning posters, stickers, slogans and pamphlets in the right language for the purpose. It should further be borne in mind that hotel-visitors are often accompanied by sevants who do not register, and who may subsequently leave the control of their employer. The management and staffs are comparatively static. The police will look after any “ bad characters ”. But even good characters cannot be expected to appreciate Security requirements without explanatory publicity. 3 SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENTS BY EXPERTS The following public appeals were broadcast from the A. I. R. station at Delhi in December, 1944, by military authorities who know what they are talk ing about, and who need our help in this6 V1 tal aspect of the task of securing victory a nd peace :— 1. Broadcast by Lieutenant-General Sir John Swayne, Chief of the General Staff, India Command “For some time before the great Allied Armada sailed for the liberation of France I was serving in the South of England. My experience there taught me the immense importance of secrecy and military security. “ You will probably think that this is obvious, but you may feel that it is a matter for the anned forces alone and you may wonder what it has got to do with you. “ Let me assure you that Security in war is a matter which concerns civilians just as much as sailors, soldiers, and airmen. We all have little bits of information which the enemy must not be allowed to have, and we want your help in preventing him from getting them. “ Without the co-operation of the general public in the United Kingdom it is doubtful whether we could have achieved the tacti cal surprise which saved thousands of lives and brought success to our arms. “To you who are waiting anxiously for the day when the shadow of war shall have passed, I appeal for help in this great task of seeing to it that India shall be a secure base for our future operations, and that never through you shall information about our preparations, however slight it may be, pass to those whom it does not concern, and from them to the listening ears of th e enemy. We rely upon your assistance. ” 2. Broadcast by Lt.-Gen. Sir W. G. Lindsell, Principal Administrative Officer, India Command “ In phase 2 of the war, when the full weight of the Allied war effort will be turned against Japan, India will become— indeed is already becoming—a great base of Allied supply. “ The materials of war being collected in this country have been produced with great labour, and have been transported great distances with anxious care. The enemy would like if they could to locate and destroy these warlike materials before they can be employed against them. It is our Security duty that no careless word or act on our part shall place the Japanese in possession of the information they so urgently require. ” 3. Broadcast by Major-General Cawthorn, Director of Intelligence, India Command “ Any one who has been intimately connected, as I am, with the obtaining of information about the enemy, cannot help being struck with the way in which ap parently small and unimportant things add up to supply us, in the end, with an In telligence picture which may have great influence on our plans for defeating the enemy. A chance remark overhea d and reported, a letter intercepted, a crossed line on the telephone—on such apparently trivial things is Intelligence built up. More often than not the giving away of information is unintentional and un realised by the culprit. This makes it doubly dangerous, because one does not know till too late how much one’s opponent has learned “ The success of our operations, and economy in the lives of our fighting men, depend in no small degree on the silence and discretion of each and every one in India who has eyes to see and ears to hear.” 4. Broadcast by Brigadier Ross Hqwman, Director of Security, India Conur d “ As the defeat of Germany comes closer, so more than ever are the Japanese straining every nerve to obtain inforn^* ation concerning our activities hero in India, so as to forestall our intentions and counter our attacks. “ If we ensure that the Japanese do not get the information they desire, we may greatly help to shorten the road to Tokyo and to speed up the return of peace to this land. “ Everyone can help by asking them selves two simple questions. ONE, might help the Japanese to know this ? “If the answer is ‘ Yes % here is question TWO. “ Is it essential, really essential, fo^^ie to pass this information on to an , v ne in speech or writing ? “ If the answer is ‘ No ’, observe, I beg you, Mr. Punch’s advice to thos&lt;*^^bout to get married, which was DON’T.” ^ 4 THE ENEMY AT WORK When the enemy is on the defensive his Intelligence Staff has to work harder than ever. In 1940 and 1941 Hitler’s armies were marching across neighbouring countries, securing abundant military in formation as they advanced. When the Germans wire at length forced &lt;*fi the defensive in what Goebbles called “ For tress Europe ” they badly needed inf sta tion from outside the fortress that wouO *bll them when, where and in what strength to expect Allied assaults.7 \ The Japanese are also being forced back towards their “ Innef Defence Zone They too require above everything to know how, when and where the Allies will attack. They cannot defend their conquest at all points at equal strength against assaults by air, land and sea. In order to know how to dispose and move their own forces and supplies, they must discover the movements and dispositions of Allied forces and supplies everywhere. That is from their vie wpoint. From our viewpoint they must not discover any of these facts; nor must they discover any other facts that may help them to guess correctly. They have their methods. Civilians have sometimes taken the military authorities to task for under-estimating the fighting powers and resources of the Japanese. But oiv^Nns themselves are woefully inclined to unu^r-estimato Japanese Intelligence. The great cricketer Wilfred Rhodes was once ^asked what he did to get a batsman out, to which he replied that he did nothing— he simply bowled at them and let them get themselves out. Enemy agents in this coun try must sometimes feel that they are in the same position. They do not have to go out in search of information ; it is daily being given to them in trains, in buses, in bazaars, in bars—those seemingly un important bits of information which complete the picture they have been com piling, or, worse still perhaps, start them off on the next picture of future operations. The following item recently appeared in the magazine (published in India) Burma Today : Dr. Susuki, who practised as a dentist oefore the evacuation, and Fuji, formerly owner of the Fuji hair-dressing saloon and photographer’s shop in Mandalay, returned to Bi^a^a with the Japanese army of occupa- tic Susuki has re-opened his practice in Rangoon, while Fuji is the principal contractor for the Japanese army in Mandalay. ” Most of us have heard similar authentic instances of apparently friendly pre-war Japanese who later turned out to have been preparing for years the Japanese rape of Asia. We shall not find them now. Any who were still at large when Japan struck, with the help of their information, at Pearl Harbour, Hongkong and Singapore, were speedily rounded up and put out of harm’s way for the duration. That necessary step was regarded by some people as locking the stable-door ^i^er the horse was stolen. Then what _ -s been happening since ? Japanese Intelligence has certainly not been idle all these years ; and just now, for reasons which have already been suggested, it is more thirsty for information and therefore more active than ever. Two things are obviously necessary to the enemy. He must get his agents into the country, or at least maintain eontact with those whom he has already planted ; and he must get his agents—or the inform ation that they have gathered—out again. It is not so easy to prevent such enemy operations as many people imagine. And it is impossible to prevent them finally and effectively without the co-operation of the general public. Compare the fundamental Security con ditions obtaining in Britain with those in India. Britain is a relatively small group of islands which can be virtually sealed off in wartime by guarding the coasts. It has one short frontier with a neutral country, between Northern Ireland and Eire ; and it will be remembered that this frontier was closed for Security reasons some weeks before “ D-Day ”. India, on the other hand, is a huge sub-continent, with a coast-line too long to be constantly protected at every yard, and with stretches of wild an uninhabited territory where enemy aircraft or single parachutists could, conceivably, land without being immediate ly detected. Moreover, as has been pointed out earlier (Chapter 2), India has a land- frontier with the neutral territory of Afghan istan, where there are enemy legations ; and also with Iran which, though now a member of the United Nations, was at one time a favourite resort of enemy agents who have not been easy to root out of the wilder parts of the country. On (geographically) Indian soil there is the neutral Portuguese territory of Goa, and other smaller Portuguese posses sions. And whereas the German enemy at hia nearest approach to Britain was separated from her shores by the English channel, the defenders of India are in land-contact with the Japanese in Burma. There is a further advantage enjoyed by th' 1 Japanese in their continuons campaign to obtain information. The millions who live in Asia are of many racial types and speak a great variety of languages. You may think that a man who speaks your own language must be a friend. You may think that the man beside you does not know the language you are speaking. You may think that you would know a Japanese if you saw one. All these assump tions leave room for errors. For one thing, Japanese agents are not necessarily Japanese. And they are cer tainly not obviously Japanese. Enemy agents are seldom obvious in any way. It is their business to look ordinary; to8 / behave unobtrusively, and in general to render themselves indistinguishable from the people around them. It is only when they are starved of information that they have to come out into the open, act suspiciously and so place themselves in danger of detection. 5 HOW SECURITY IS BROKEN The four commonest causes of the leakage of information may be explained to a variety of audiences as “ Four Human Failings ” against which everyone must be on his guard. These four failings are : 1. Conceit 2. Faith 3. Enthusiasm 4. Ignorance It may be asked why Faith has been included in a list of human failings. Faith can move mountains, but it may move them in the wrong direction. In the struggle with a dangerous enemy, misplaced faith cannot be considered a virtue. Even faith in a friend or relative may be misplaced. Faith in a telephone certainly is. It may also be asked why Treachery has been omitted from the list. Of all human delinquencies Treachery is usually regarded as the blackest. And so it is, but it is not a common cause of leakage of information. If it were. Security would be a simpler matter than it is. There may be a few people here and there, in India as in all other countries, who have deliberately engaged themselves in the work of betraying their own land and their own fellow-citizens to the foe. There may be a few others who have been cruelly blackmailed into the same dirty work. But by far the largest quantity of vital inform ation reaching the enemy comes to him not from wilful treachery but from our own care lessness which his agents are carefully trained to exploit—our own vanity and conceit, our own misplaced confidence in people or institutions, our own enthusiasm about our work or about someone else's work, our own ignorance of the ways in which the enemy's Intelligence system goes about its patient and sinister business. There are many ways of bringing th e Four Failings before the public in speeches, broadcasts, through films, adver tisements and pictures. The following are brief sample treatments, capable of con siderable adaption and expansion to suit different uses and different localities. 1. Conceit “ Vanity ”, wrote Cecil Rhodes, “ is incalculable. It will always let you down.’’ It lets down essential Security more than any other single factor. All of us like to boast a little ; all of us like to appear wiser than the next man—and perhaps especially if there’s a woman around. It is tempting to make much of one’s job and now-a-days there are very few lines of business or employment which do not bear some relation, however remote and indirect, to the War. Even a small job can be made to look important by big talk, and big talk is what the enemy sooner or later hears. It isn’t necessarily the squadron-leader who by a carelessly dropped word starts vital information on its way to T'^Vo. It may be the man who supplied a pot of paint for the fuselage and just couldn’t help talking about it. It is seldom the^ Master of a vessel who thoughtlessly bet rays himself, his crew, his ship and his cargo to enemy submarines. More often it’s someone on land who wanted to appear ” in the know ” by talking importantly in frequented places. It is very attractive to know more than the newspapers, to be cleverer than the offi cial announcements, to be able to contradict someone else, to demolish a critic of your own war effort or your own business by telling him just how and why you are so busy. That is Conceit, the Jap’s best friend. 2. Faith Have you ever lifted a telephone-re ceiver and found yourself accidentally eav&lt;^&gt; dropping on a conversation between two' other people ? Nearly everybody who uses a telephone must have had this experience at some time or other. And in these the strain on telephone-systems mak it 0 ~ more liable to happen than ever before. The next question is : Has some other person ever similarly cut in on your own conversation ? And that question you pro bably cannot answer. For if the tapping happened by accident the third party was in all likehood too diffident to make him self known ; and if it was deliberate he would c ertainly not give himself away. Faith in the Security of the telephone is always misplaced. So is faith in certain other public institutions like the postal service, which we normally take for granted. They are not infallible, especially in war-time ; and in war-time the enemy makes it his business to find their existing weak spots and to produce others. But caution must go even further these perilous times. Faith in our fellow, beings can be a failing. It is not s 09 much that the plausible stranger in the train or the waiting room may be an enemy agent. The danger is that he may be a poorer judge of character than yourself— and he in turn may pass on your unguarded information to someone who is actually in touch mth the enemy. For the word once' spoken can never be recalled. To add “ of course you won’t pass this on ” doesn’t improve the situation. It makes it worse by giving additional interest and importance to what you have said. If you have found it worth while to reveal it to another depend upon it that he will find it worth while to pass it further. And at the end of that winding road lies Japanese General Headquarters. Faith in God, faith in Justice, faith in Victory Yes. But for the rest, watch yt^ step ! 3. Enthusiasm. The following extract is taken from the notebook of a leader of the French Resis tance Movement : “ Our indiscretions are caused not so much by carelessness, the desire to boast or even stupidity, as by our admiration. Our people are mostly full of emotional uplift. They love to magnify and sublimate our comrades and, above all, our leaders. It keeps them going, heartens them, and gives a poetical feeling to ' their monotonous daily task. * You know X has done something really magnificent’, says one who is in the know to another. And the other must share the news with a third. And so on until the story s told to an informer. Nothing is more ^ingerous than this generosity of heart. ” So the French knew the dangers of in- discret enthusiasm in their continuing struggle with the German invader. We ht^^ beaten off the Japanese invader, and th..„ in itself is a subject for enthusiasm. But if we let enthusiasm get the better of us, the tough business of removing the Japa nese danger and freeing Asia will be both longer and bloodier than it need be. It can even go wrong altogther if Security in military matters is broken, as thoughtless enthusiasm can break it. If you met the Japanese Chief-of-Sterff in the street tomorrow you would not greet him with exhilarating news of some new aircraft or armoured vehicle that you happened to know in the way of business. You might be thrilled by the sight of our troops and the troops of our Allies passing cheerfully across India in one direction or another. You might be excited by re- ^^nt news of a relative in the fighting or 'ipply services, or by some work you were doing yourself to help in pushing the war to a speedy and victorious end. But you would hardly choose these as subjects for a chat with the enemy. ( 3 ) The vital thing to remember is that at any.’ and every moment, without being aware. °f y° u &gt;na y be having that chat with the enemy. A scrap of information, bub bling forth in a mood of enthusiasm, finds its way by all sorts of devious channels to join the stream in which the enemy is diligently fishing. To you it may seem an insignificant scrap. To the Nippon fisherman it may be the key piece in a jigsaw- puzzle of thousands of such scraps. So save your enthusiasm for the life- and-death work of Security, which in terms of human lives and happiness—of your own among them—is worth all that we can put into it. 4. Ignorance “ How can the little I know be of any value to anyone ? ” Many people ask- this question ; and the answer is that by itself it may be of no value, but collated and sifted by enemy experts it may easily prove to be just the piece that is required to complete his information. People are today going about their busi ness, or travelling through the country, and frequently giving away vital information simply because they are ignorant of the way in which the enemy’s Intelligence Service works. Enemy agents no longer conduct their work —if indeed they ever did—in the sole ' guise of seductive and expensively orna mented ladies who extract plans or other documents from the clothing of high per sonages when such clothing has been impulsively cast aside. Enemy agents are very ordinary, indistinguishable, hard-work ing individuals who use their ears and eyes and wits, and unobtrusively encourage people to say more than they should. Remember—an enemy agent is paid well and for that he has got to produce results. Starve him of information, and he has to come out into the open to get it. Thus ho risks detection and capture. It is better to keep silent ami seem to be a fool than to open your mouth and prove it. Ayul let nobody ever say : “ I didn't think it )nattered. ” That is a confession of cataclysmic and criminal ignorance. 6 A NOTE ON RUMOURS Freedom of speech is one of the fun - damental things for which we are fighting. But Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was Justice of the Supreme Court in America. — — „10 laid it down that freedom of speech does Hot confer on the individual the right to raise a false shout of “ Fire ! ” in a crowded theatre, where that one word rtiigtlt lead to injuries and loss of life in eC panic rush for the exits. Nor in wartime can anyone claim the right to spread injuri- otis rumours—an offence usually described as “ spreading alarm and despondency We have perhaps passed the phase of the war in which alarm and despondency could be most readily and dangerously spread. But the rumour-monger is still amongst us in considerable numbers ; and the system of recording rumours locally, and correlating them centrally for counter-action where necessary, still reveals fantastic and sometimes malicious imagi nations at work among credulous audiences. Since rumours are founded on false, or exaggerated, or distorted information, and since indeed they are often set going by the enemy himself, it might be thought that they have nothing to do with the epemy’s attempts to find out useful facts. It is not, in fact, proposed to discuss in this Handbook the many varieties of rumour, their origin, movements and possible effects. But the subject of rumours is related to Security for the following two reasons : 1. The rumour-monger is almost certainly a careless talker as well .—Where rumours are spread, chattering and listening to chatter is already a bad habit, and some of that chatter is sure to include information of value to the enemy. In attacking rumours the publicist is at the same time promoting discretion. 'There are, moreover, possibilities of pointing out parallels in the two types of offence. A rumour-monger may easily spread the sort of panic or false expectation that leads to hoarding and consequent shortages in civil supplies. A careless talker can equally cause a reduction in the available necessities of life by giving away infor mation which enables the enemy to intercept and destory incoming supplies. The ad monition to both nuisances is : “ Keep your mouth shut!” 2. Rumours sometimes necessitate a denial that may help the enemy .—It is well known that enemy broadcast propaganda, parti cularly on the details of sea and air opera tions, is often put out in order to goad the Alli es into counter propaganda of a kind that will reveal the information the enemy requires. This explains the policy adopted by the Allied Governments in regard (for instance) to shipping losses, which are reported after a suitable interval and in such a way as to yield no additional information to the enemy. Similarly the enemy often adopts the device of starting a rumour in such a way that a denial, if it is publicly made, may enable him to learn the truth. A serious example of this occurred when a troop transport left New Zealand with reinforcements for the N.Z.E.F. Soon after the ship left port, a rumour that she had been torpedoed and sunk with heavy loss of life spread like wildfire. The story was repeated all over New Zealand and relatives and friends of the men who had left on the transport heard the report. Their anxiety can be imagined. So serious and general was the reaction that the Government was compelled to broadcast an official denial of the sinking and of am' attack. The people were reassured ; the lie had been killed ; but resulting f)is*m the denial was valuable information ,o the enemy that a troop transport had left New Zealand and was still on the high —and dangerous—seas. ^ 7 EXAMPLES AND ANECDOTES Many people are still doubtful of the real importance of Security. They do not believe that “ the enemy is listen ing They do not see how information can be collected by him. And they do not see that the scraps they lightly let fall can be valuable even if they are passed out of the country. It may be difficult to convince the coi^^ firmed sceptic by mere theoretical argu ment. He will want dramatic examples. There are plenty of these but Security itself restricts the number of authfl^jc incidents that can be safely quoted. ., e do not want to tell the enemy either how his search for Intelligence is defeated, or how accurate the information he has succeeded in gathering may be. Nevertheless there is evidence which can be used in Security Education to en liven a lecture and to carry conviction to the stubborn, and further examples will be published as they become available in the C. P. D. fortnightly leaflet Victory••• •With Care. The Normandy Landings Most people are sufficiently familiar with contemporary history, for instance, to realise that tactical surprise was achieved in the “ D-Day ” landings in Normandv^p. although the Allied intention to return Uf * Europe had been known to the Germans and the whole world for years, and although the operations were enormous in their scope.Mr. Churchill, who is not given to empty talk, is authority for the statement that the Allies were successful in achieving tactical surprise on this vital occasion. The task of discovering the details of “ D-Day ” in advance must have been the primary duty of the German Intelligence, and German Intelligence has always been re garded as resourceful and well organised. Yet while thousands of servicemen knew of the operation for days in advance (and many civilians also must have had items of information which would have disclosed the secret if they had been revealed), the Germans did not know the time and specific places, and actually were surprised when the great invasion fleets appeared off the French coast on the morning of June 6, 1944. Nor did subsequent information opined by the Germans after the landings habegun prove adequate for their purposes. One authentic account described how Allied forces detailed to clean up minefields on the invasion beaches found German warning notices indicating the location of mines. The enemy had not had time to remove them. Only perfect Security measures could have achieved this success against a well- prepared and expectant enemy. It did not just happen by accident, an indeed there were some near shaves. The U. S. War Department, for instance, released to the Press as a warning example the story of the Major-General commanding the Ninth U. S. Army Air Force in England. This officer was reduced to the permanent rank of lieutenant-colonel before the invasion revealing, at a London cocktail-party, formation concerning “ D-Day The guests at that party fortunately did the right thing with the information. They reported it to the authorities and otherwise kr^ quiet. Surprise in the Pacific As for the Pacific, it was no military secret that the Allies were going to invade the Philippines. In 1942 General Mac- Arthur announced that he was going back, and he reaffirmed the statement publicly on a number of occasions. Yet on Leyte, Mindoro, and again on Luzon, the Japanese were initially taken by surprise, and this factor was of great assistance to the pro gress of the U. S. forces. Surprise had been achieved at many pre vious points in the Allied “ island-hopping ” advance—but not always. Plans for attacks in New Britain in December 1943 are believed to have been known to the Japanese. ®Smour and loose talk also endangered oper ations at Hollandia and Aitape, but for tunately it did not reach the enemy in time to nullify the effect of tactical surprise. 11 Here are some further illustrative ex amples. Effective Security 1. When the American aircraft-carrier Lexington was sunk in May 1942, the Japanese did not see her go down. Therefore the Japanese Intelligence Staff were unable to estimate the strength of the naval force opposing them. There were many sur vivors from the Lexington, but the secret was well kept, and the Japanese were led to believe that the Lexington might still be afloat. As a result they probably over-estimated the strength of the American force before which they turned tail and fled at the famous Battle of Midway later on. Had any of those Lexington survivors gi#en away information about the sinking of their ship—and all of us can judge for ourselves how tempting it must have been to talk after such an experience—the whole Japanese plan of campaign might have been altered to our disadvantage. 2. In his famous book about the first great move in the Allied recovery in the Pacific, Guadalcanal Diary, Richard Tre- gaskis wrote : “We knew why we had been able to sail into Tulagi Baj' and under the Jad guns without being fired upon. The enemy had been caught completely unawares. ” On a number of subsequent occasions in the great story of island-hopping, it has been reported that the Allies were able to develop their attacks at times and places which caught the Japanese by surprise, thus helping greatly towards the success which we later read about in headlines in our newspapers. Breaches of Security 1. Six months before the information was taken off the Secret List, the Japanese knew that B. 29 Superfortress aircraft were coming to India. There is evidence that this fact was in the hands of the enemy Intelligence staff in Japan before the end of 1943. But the news that B. 29’s were actually in India was not publicly released until June 1944. Somehow the secret leaked. The enemy would now like to know whether his reports of numbers, performance and any other details he may think he has gathered are correct or incorrect. And that he is not going to be told except with bombs. Yet there are still people who say that there are no such things as enemy agents and that careless talks doesn’t matter.12 2. Here is some evidence of the necessity of postal censorship, given by a censorship authority in Eastern India : “ In one fortnight alone, from the frac tional portion of mail which the censors actually scrutinised, it was found that correspondents had revealed the situation of fourteen airfields, the transport of air borne troops from an airfield in India into Burma, reference to the use of gliders at a time when it was most essential that this move should be kept secret, six move ments of troops, the presence of aircraft- carriers and the movements of ships.” 3. At a time when the Japanese were par ticularly active in the Indian Ocean they succeeded in torpedoing a transport carrying troops to Ceylon. A destroyer was also damaged, and the salvage-ship sent to rescue her was itself torpedoed. All this was common talk in Colombo even before the remainder of the convoy had reached port. The departure of certain troops from Ceylon—even the date of the departure—were also being talked about for some time before they left. Careless talk does cost lives. 4. Here is a true story from North Africa. It concerns soldiers, but yon will at once see that its moral applies with equal force to ordinary people, many of whom have access to the kind of information w'hioh was given away in this instance. Some Allied soldiers were being enter tained in a dockside cafe by the happy and excited residents of a small town from which the Germans had recently fled. Among the crowd at the bar, undetected and looking just like anyone else, was an enemy agent. When everyone was feeling happy and talkative, the agent joined in and started cursing the Germans, saying that they had robbed the population of all their food and had left them to starve, which was very likely true. The natural answer from our men (as it was meant to be) was that the Allies would behave very differently and would provide the population with all the food they needed. But the agent still looked doubtful. He maintained that food could not reach them in time—the Germans would not let it. This of course, stung the pride of one of his listeners who, un fortunately, had knowledge of the im pending arrival of a large convoy. “Don’t worry, ” he said to the assembled com pany, who now^ were beginning to look glum and depressed. “ Don’t worry—we shall look after you. Within three days from now you will see enough food unloaded on these docks to give all of you whatever you need.” That careless remark, made merely to impress seemingly friendly people at a cheerful gathering, resulted in the convoy losing two ships—sunk because an enemy agent had persuaded somebody to say more than he should. Discretion Rewarded The following curious anecdote was re ported in the American magazine Time r “ At the first Quebec Conference (August 1943), rugged Canadian Sergeant-Major Emile Couture’s job w'as to keep conferees supplied with stationery. It was also his job to pick up the unused paper when th3 Conference was over. One morning in the Chateau Frontenac he found a piece of paper on which were boldly written the alternative dates for ‘ D-Day ’, number of troops and ships to be vte.u * and data on air-cover. “ Sergeant-Major Couture rushed to his ^ commanding officer, Major Charles Edward Gemaey, and reported his find. Washing ton and London were informed. Yes, the paper had been missed. Both men were rushed to Washington. There they took solemn oaths of secrecy. “At the second Quebec Conference the story leaked out. Couture, 29, and Gernaey, 37, were awarded British Empire Medals for keeping the biggest secret of the war. Who had lost the ‘ D-Day ’ document, or what had happened to him, military authorities would not sav ”. Wingate’s Testimony '•V The late Major-General Wingate, who had opportunities of first-hand observation, wrote of the Japanese : “ The Japanese mind is slow and me* i&gt;- ^ dieal. He is a reasoned, if humourless, student of war in all its phases. He has principles which he applies not over im aginatively, but he hates a leap in the dark to such an extent that he will do anything rather than ?nakc it.” 8 QUOTABLE QUOTES 1. “ Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shall, fare never the worse.

Military Security has already made use of a wide variety of slogans for stickers in places where- members of the services congregate. Ideas and phrases that call attention to Security should be selected or coined for display in bars, cafes and restaurants ; in factories and labour-depots ; beside public and office telephones ; in trains, trams, buses, taxis and other vehicles ; on blotting pads and calendars ; in the private and public rooms of hotels and at the reception-desk ; in public lavatories and retiring-rooms ; at all public offices and control-shops where people have to wait ; in post and telegraph offices, and so forth. In each case the phrase used will have more power if it is chosen with a particular view to the place of display and the type of person frequenting it. The choice of the most suitable language or combination of languages for each use is also im portant, and it may be borne in mind that an English phrase does not always retain its aptitude when literally rendered in« an Indian language. The preparation of effective Security posters also depends frequently on the right selection of a slogan for illustration. 51. Don’t mail it—Yale it. 52. Rather be dumb than dangerous. 53. Victory ahead—but talk delays. ^^»4. Next of kin have been informed ; But who informed the enemy ? Long tongues shorten lives. 56. W’ords with a stranger spell danger. 57. Think before you ink. 58.

NOTE : Suitability to a particular use is an important point in the effective 10 PUBLICITY FOR CONVICTIONS In Germany and Japan civilians found guilty of breaches of Security can and often do suffer the death penalty. One of our publicity lines is that “ we prefer Security Education.” Nevertheless the divulging, by publi cation, correspondence or word of mouth, of information (true or false) likely to assist the enemy, is an offence under the D. I. R.*, and this fact must be made widely known. As publicity for Security increases, it is hoped that magistrates will generally come to realise, as many of them already do, that these are not matters for leniency. At the same time Security Education will be assisted by giving due publicity, through the daily Press and by other means, to convictions and punishments inflicted, for offences against Security. Some recent examples are given below, and further ones will be published, as they become available in the C. P. D. fort nightly leaflet Victory. .. . With Care. Pro vincial and local authorities and organisa tions, however, are urged to make their own arrangements for collecting and pub licising reports of convictions in their areas. * See Appendix II.16 Examples 1. A civilian in possession of a cine film showing the departure of an aircraft- carrier from an Indian port has been fined Rs. 200. He was allowed to retain the camera on furnishing a bond of Rs. 1,000 not to use the camera again for the dura tion of the war. 2. A European officer of a Karach 1 firm was sentenced under the D.il. R. to pay a fine of Rs. 250 for disclosing the date of the sailing of a ship in the • course of a letter to his agent in Muscat. 3. A Goanese subject who telegraphed to a relation giving the sailing date of a steamer from Karachi to Bombay, was convicted imder the D. I. R. and sentenced to one day’s simple imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 250 or, in default, rigorous imprisonment for one month. 4. Mr. A. G. Skeggs of Spencers, Madras, was sentenced by the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Madras, to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000 or in default to undergo imprisonment for two months. He was charged with having communicated to another person information likely to assist the enemy. 5. For communicating in a letter details of the movements of shipping, Allan Ramsay of Calcutta was convicted imder the Defenc e of India Rules and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000, or in default to undergo three months’ rigorous imprisonment. The Chief Presidency Magistrate accepted the statement of the accused that he acted 4 ‘ thoughtlessly and foolishly but not with any sinister motive ”. 6. For a similar offence E. Guthrie was fined Rs. 1,000, or in default to undergo one month’s- simple imprisonment, by the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta. 7. For taking cinematograph pictures of naval vessels lying at river moorings at Calcutta, a civilian was fined Rs. 500 by the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta. 8. Two West African soldiers were stopped by a civilian and asked questions regarding the strength of their unit, where they came from and if they had been to Burma. Instead of repljdng, they handed him over to the civil authorities. As a result of their commendable action the civilian was convicted under D. I. R. and sentenced to six months’ imprison ment. 9. For communicating in a letter military information likely to assist the enemy W. G. White, a Civilian Supervisor in an Ordnance Depot, was fined Rs. 100 or, in default, one month’s R. I. by the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Madras. 10. For having disclosed shipping infor mation in a private letter to Portuguese India, a merchant seaman was convicted under the D. I. R. and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 75 or in default to undergo six weeks rigorous imprisonment. 11 NOTES ON MEDIA AND ORGANI SATION (A) MEDIA All media of publicity are capable o* utilisation for the purposes of Security Education.

Inter-Service Security Education Department Headquarters India Command. There are two wings of the I.S.E.D. The- Executive Wing under Lt. Comdr. Bruce Belfrage, R.N.V.R., consists of a team of Security officers of all Services who, by virtue of their pre-war occupations, are experienced speakers (in English and some Indian languages). The Production Wing under S/Ldr. Bush, R.A.F., produces Security posters, slides, film and broadcast ing scripts, etc. The whole organisation is directed by Comdr. G. C. Clairmonte,. R.N.R. The I.S.E.D. is responsible for Security Education among the Services in India and Ceylon. Security Education among the civil population is being promoted, with I.S.E.D.’s collaboration, by the I. &amp; B. Department of the Government of India, to which, as explained in the previous sec tion, enquiries and correspondence on matters of civil Security Education should, ordinarily be addressed. The I.S.E.D., however, will be glad to give advice and suggestions on matters requiring the co operation of the Services, and may be addressed directly as follows : H.Q. India Command (I.S.E.D.), C/o New Delhi, G.H.Q.A.P.O. C. LOCAL LIAISON AND ORGANISATION 1. Provincial Government Publicity Or- ganisations willing to take part in Security Education are asked (i) to co-ordinate their activities with National War Front Provincial Organi sations. (ii) to establish direct contact with All India Radio Station Directors for broad casting purposes. 2. H.Q. India Command has circularised H. Qs. Armies/Commands asking them to co-ordinate necessary action by the Services in their areas. This includes the establishment of small local Inter- Service Security Education Advisory Committees, the Chairman of which have been recommended to contact N. W. F. Provincial Organisers and A.I.R. Station Directors concerned, and to dis cuss with them any special local Security Education of the Services with that of the general public, thereby ensuring that all concerned derive full benefit from lectures, films, broadcasts etc., of mutual interest and benefit.18 APPENDIX I INLAND CENSORSHIP 1. The following Press Communique, released on April 14, 1944, gave notice that India had been brought into line, in the matter of inland censorship of opera tional matters, with other countries (such as Britain) involved in “ major military activities ” : “ Military security is vital to any nation at war. Its importance is increased when the enemy is within reach of a country’s land and sea frontiers. It becomes even more important when the enemy is thrown on the defensive but is still in contact and expects an attack, for he will then re double his efforts to obtain information from within the base from which an attack on him can be launched. India has now reached this latter stage as it has become a major base for offensive operations against the Japanese, and in view of its increasing operational importance, the whole problem of security has been re viewed. “ Despite widespread propaganda to stop careless talk and careless correspondence, there is still a considerable element, both in official and non-official circles, which fails to understand what extensive harm can result from gossip, especially in •correspondence, about matters of military importance. Not only the lives of Indian and Allied soldiers, sailors and airmen but also the security of Indian civilian lives and property are endangered by the leakage of military information. “ The majority of the public, and the press in particular, fully appreciate the need for military security, but it is clear that owing to th thoughtlessness and carelessness of a small minority the essential degree of military security has not yet been achieved. Solely in the interest of military security, the Government of India, therefore, find it imperative to exercise their powers of censorship in respect of non-official in ternal postal and telegraphic correspondence, and to issue a warning that anyone found guilty of a serious breach of security in the course of correspondence will be severely dealt with. “ The effect of this decision is to bring India into line with the practice already existing in other countries involved in major military activities such as the United Kingdom itself. Every endeavour will be made to avoid delay to correspondence and inconvenience to the public and it is stressed that the censorship will only be exercised in respect of matters which would be detri mental to the conduct of operations if leakage to the enemy occurred. All corres pondence opened in this censorship will be clearly marked “ Opened by Examiner ” t but no notice will be given of the areas in which, and the period for which, the censorship will operate from time to time. “ Attention is drawn to some of the more important matters which must not be conveyed in private postal and tele graphic correspondence, e.g. (i) Location, numbers or movements— past, present or future—of convoys, or any naval, military or Air Force units, detachments or ships, and the arrival or non-arrival of reinforcements ; (ii) Armaments or equipment of any kind ; (iii) Distinguishing signs for the identi fication of formations, units and their transport; (iv) Communications, such as the cons truction, use, condition or probable ex tension of ports, roads, aerodromes, railways or other transportation facilities ; (v) Details of damage or casualties caused by enemy action in military installations and major public utility con terns. 2. DON’T LEAVE IT ALL TO THE CENSOR The institution of inland censorship of mails by no means removes from the individual citizen the wartime respon sibility for the utmost caution in corres pondence. Publicity for Security Educa tion should make a point of discouraging the attitude that “ if it’s dangerous the censor will cut it out ”. Only a propor tion of the mails is scrutinised, and although this means that every indiscreet corr^^ pondent places himself in danger of cc viction and punishment, it does not mean that all possibility of a leakage to the enemy is automatically eliminated. 3- THE REASON FOR INLAND CENSORSi-.P Mails leaving the country by sea, air or land have since the outbreak of war, been subject to censorship. This is because once they have left India, there has been a possibility of loss in transit to the enemy’s advantage. The extension of the censorship to in land mails was made for the same reason. Not only single letters, but whole mail- bags may sometimes go astray in India. Enemy agents are working and waiting for opportunities like this. Censorship is not instituted so tha^ military and civil officials may amuse themselves by the perusal of other people’s private affairs. Tiiey are too busy, aia^ they are not interested. But they '+r • interested in preventing the enemy from obtaining operational information through thoughtless correspondence.APPENDIX II SECURITY OF SHIPPING AND OTHER INFORMATION Reproduction of the Pamphlet “ Notes on Security of Information ” issued by the S.P., C.I.D., Mylapore, Madras. 1. The introduction of Inland Censor ship* brings the whole question of what may and what may not properly be written or spoken on the subject of war time opera tions to the fore. 2. The notes below are drawn up in very general terms in the hope that they may be of some use to business firms and others who are uncertain as to what they may legitimately pass on. 3. A golden rule of security is “ Before passing on any information which has not appeared in the Press or been broad cast, first consider whether your intended recip ien t needs to have this information for furtherance of the war effort, and secoriuly consider whether he or she can be trusted only to make proper use of H. ” Only if these two questions are .nswered satisfactorily should the com munication be made. SHIPPING I. General Principles Shipping Security policy involves the following fundamental principles :— (1) Concealment from the enemy of— Details of convoys or of escorts. Movements of convoys or any kind of : ship sailing independently. Details of manning or ships’ armaments. Casualties, whether to ships or personnel. Weather conditions. (2) That messages or correspondence shall not in any way give information of value t^ie enemy if they fall int &gt; his hands. That all communications relating to cargoes, loading and discharging, etc., approximate dates of arrival or departure, posi^ups or movements of vessels in the '^Hndi coasting trade, including that jetween India and Ceylon, be passed on with as little interference and delay as possible. (4) That only what is really necessary be communicated. II. Internal Commnnications When telephoning or telegraphing about shipping matters, the same precautions should be observed as are set out under “ general Principles ”. In exceptional cir cumstances some relaxation of these pre cautions may be necessary, but this is permissible only when the information is not of a particularly secret nature. III. Correspondence T’he “ General Principles ” should be f^^rved also in the matter of corres pondence between shipping companies and their agents. No reference what- : soever may be made about the movements of ships in correspondence between privat individuals. Correspondence on shipping matters should be transmitted in double covers, the inner one being sealed securely with wax and marked “ Secret. Only to be opened by the person named theron ”, and the outer cover bearing no indication of the secret contents of the letter and marked “ Personal and Urgent ”. The covers should be sent by registered and insured post. Letters for ships’ crews frequently arrive after the particular ship has left the port. The present practice is for these letters to be redirected to the next known port of call of the ship, thereby giving away the ship’s destination. The only practicable way to avoid this is to put all these letters in one large envelope which should bear only the address of the shipping agents at destination. When the outer envelope is opened at destination, it will be obvious to the recipient firm to whom the letters s hould be given. IV. Passengers’ Tickets, Embarkation Notices, etc. Information given to passengers should be restricted to the minimum necessary. The ship’s name should newer be mentioned. When informing passengers that they have been allotted passages, only an approximate sailing date, e.g., the begi ming, middle, or end of the month should be given. Shortly before the actual date of departure, the passengers should be informed of the time and place where they should report and of special railway arrangements, etc,, if any. All passengers should be warned that any information given them about embarkation is to be treated as personal and strictly confidential, and cautioned about the danger of careless talk concerning the voyage. They should also be told not to attempt the use of private codes to in dicate their date of departure, etc., and that their own safety depends on their observance of these obligations. GENERAL I. Discretion on the part of all connected with the shipping and other Wartime Industries Idle gossip and careless talk of seafar ing and shipping men form a fertile field for enemy agents ; shipping authorities should therefore request the Masters of their ships constantly to impress upon officers, crews and passengers the absolute necessity for discretion in correspondence and con versation about anything to do with ship ping movements, armaments, etc. This exhortation applies to all persons engaged on war work. ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■20 A frequent excuse for loose talk is the presumption that the information is al ready common knowledge, but this excuse is seldom justified, as the rumours in cir culation are generally based on intelligent guess work which is frequently erroneous. The temptation for those who know the true facts to confirm or deny such rumours must be resisted. Shipowners and other firms engaged on war work should impress upon their Staffs and Agents that they should not disclose to relatives of seamen any information regarding ships movements or the work they are doing other than in very general terms and should in no circumstances give a sliip s destination or next port of call or refer to secret works. It is per missible, however, to state roughly the period which must elapse before a ship can bo expected home. Any urgent mess ages for men abroad can be cabled by the agents and replies can be received through them. All connected with the shipping and other vital war industries should be asked to co-operate to the best of their ability in observing faithfully the fore- going rules which are of a general nature, and not to pass on information unless it is absolutely essential. II. Description of an Offence The foregoing notes apply particularly to safeguarding shipping information, but mutalis mutandis these principles apply equally well to all other operational in formation. A very useful general des cription of operational information is con tained in Rule 34 (5) of the Defence of India Rules describing ‘‘ information likely to assist to enemy ”. In this connection it is important to remember that it is an offence to pass on, no matter how indirect ly* information of this kind whether it is true or false. Among the prohibited matters are details of the armed forces and their armament and equipment, possible oper ations, morale, military works, informa tion about spies, notes on munitions, notes on protection of communications, pro hibited areas, losses due to enemy action, cyphers, and any other matter informaton about which might, even indirectly, be of use to the enemy. III. Action against offenders Any person who divulges “ confidential information ” as defined in Rule 34 (2) of the Defence of India Rules, or divulges information likely to assist the enemy vide the same rule, sub-rule (5), is liable for prosecution under Rule 38 (5), of these Rules, the penalties under which are most severe. The Security authorities have no wish unnecessarily to harass the public, but it has to be remembered that the enemy can readily build up a, very accurate picture of warlil^% pre parations in India from odd scraps &lt;f in formation divulged through careless letter- writing and conversations which ma^k be intercepted and passed on to then^ lo prevent this the Security Services,, primary concern, and they would be failing in their duty if they did not take- up all cases of breach of the spirt of these instructions. The purpose of this note is not minatory but purely advisory as an aid to mutual co-operation. CONCLUSION Don’t pass on information to any one&gt; unless he needs it, Don’t pass on more than he needs. Don’t pass it on until he needs it. Don’t neglect the possibility of misuse of the contents of the waste-paper baskg^t Don’t underestimate the enemy’s sources of intelligence. Don’t pose as wiser than the next, man because you know the facts. Don’t hesitate to check dangerous gai^^ rulity by any one, Service or civilian. Don’t underestimate the danger of eaves droppers.

A. mm SITUATION l. U.S.S.&amp;. For the study of one of her largest and potentially most important neighbours Russia has remarkably few sources of objective information. The articles on India in the Encyclopaedia Sovietica are inaccurate and tenden tious and more recent publications such as Melman's India and Dyakov's articles in War and the Wording Class are open to the same objections. To counteract this there is the admirable British Ally, but in its last twelve issues only 1.25% of the contents was devoted to India, rep resenting an annual total of about 10,000 words — an inadequate allotment to give a true picture of India's recent political and economic development. The Russians accept the situation with regrettable equanimity: Moscow reactions to publications from Delhi are still conspicuously absent. The British Embassy there approve the productions but are silent about their effect. There have recently appeared in British Ally reviews complimentary to a new American publication, so per haps the distribution problem is easing off and we may soon receive authoritative comments. We are still mainly dependent, however, on opinions outside Russia and these are now numerous and favourable enough to jus tify the complete confidence that Indian publicity to Russia will establish itself in the long run: the defeatist attitude that the hedgehog position of Russia is impreg nable will have to be abandoned. The Russian Embassy in Tehran, for example, 'is delighted with Dunya'; Tabriz is also very favourably disposed towards it and the main agent for Soviet pub lications sells a large number of the Russian edition, though 'the bewildering jumble of polyglot inscrip tions on the cover ' is said to discourage buyers. Indian Chronicle is more imponderable but a recent very detailed analysis of the issues to date suggests that no radical revision of policy is necessary. The plan of lightening the contents by the inclusion of literary compositions has been, at least temporarily, abandoned: the siege is still to the 'heavy artillery'; and the policy of having articles by the best available experts of whatever nationality still seems the soundest. The plan of campaign therefore will be to snipe at Russian nationals abroad wherever they may be, while blindly bombarding the main fortress: the quality of our ammunition will eventually win respect on its merits. 2. Persia It would be only through very rose-coloured spec tacles that an improvement in the position in Persia could be seen. The internal situation is confused and has all the elements of further confusion : events outside Persia such as the British election results and the atomic bomb are employed by contending parties inside the country to make the confusion worse confounded. The end of the war in the Far East, though it does not seem to have evoked much enthusiasm, has strengthened the demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Even if — which is to say the least unlikely — this withdrawal ten^^ to unify the contending elements in Persian party poli tics, it would almost inevitably mean a deterioration in the excellent roads maintained by the military; and this would equally inevitably tend to increase the already serious distribution difficulties. We have been dependent for the distribution of our publications on the good offices of a friend whose organisation may be severely strained not only by the conditions described above but perhaps also by the financial axe. Investigations have recently been carried out in Persia as to the possibility of shipping all our material to flbadan, and thence by rail to Tehran, where it will be distributed by a large commercial firm. This would obviate the necessity of sending material over land by the slow route from Zahidan — a route which may possibly become quite irregular if the roads deteriorate rapidly. These investigations show that the schem quite feasible and arrangements are being made to put it into operation as soon as possible. It is perhaps not out of place to put on record our gratitude for the help we have received in the past in the distribution of our material through the Embassy in Tehran. Sales of Shaipur during the period under review decreased, largely owing to economic pressure, to trans port diffculties and perhaps to a temporary stoppage of supplies to provincial agents to jolt them into paying their bills. The price has now been decreased to bring it into line with that charged in Iraq. On the other hand, the first editions of Dunya were hailed with delight and described as 'a great improvement on Jehan-i-Imruz', and all the copies of Heyday were rapidly sold out. There has been some subsequent falling off in the sales of Dunya. 3. Persian Gulf:— In an attempt to improve the speed with which pub lications reach Bushire by sea, some quantities of2 material have been seen sent there by registered book post. We are still waiting to know if any improvement has resulted. 4. Iraq:— In the last few months the demand for Al Nafir suffered a considerable setback due to economic pressure and to increased competition. Various suggestions have been made to counteract the drop in sales; they have all been examined carefully and one solution seems to be the provision of gaily-coloured and attractive insets which f ave long been known for their power to captivate Iraqi minds. European observers in Iraq have suggested that we should use the meretricious charms of film stars as subjects for these insets, but perhaps a more 'cultural ' line would be facsimiles of modern Indian paintings. Investigations are being carried out to overcome small &gt;”Nhnical difficulties. - Another bait for the Iraqi market is a better quality ^ paper such as is used by many of the externally-produced magazines now competing in Iraq. If we can be sure of sufficient stocks of better paper becoming available, a change to a higher quality paper would undoubtedly help our sales. A third but ancient difficulty is that of obtaining sufficient staff, but now that military and other depart ments throughout the Middle East may be expected to decrease their personnel it is possible that qualified Arabic translators will become available. 5. Afghanistan:— A very distinct improvement indeed in the status of United Publications in Afghanistan seems to have taken place. A Government officer on a recent visit to Kabul found the Afghan authorities much more prepared ^ ^pernrit if not actually to encourage the entry of Taj Mahal into the country. It is even possible that the magazine will find its way into the schools. Past ex perience makes us none too sanguine of such volte-face, however, and we are ' waiting and seeing.' The King of Afghanistan was graciously pleased to express his pleasure at the bound copies of Ahang and Le Clairon presented to him by the Division. 6. horth West Frontier Material for Zhwand is now coming in to the Editor in greatly increased quantities and the interest of the magazine will consequently be increased. Reactions are few and far between, but the fact that interest is being maintained is indicated by many letters making suggestions that there should be, for example, more religious articles 'for the Mullas' or that a thicker pen should be used for the calligraphy. 7. U.S.A.:- With the first issue of Perspective now ready for dis tribution (See Section B. Paragraph 8 (c)) we may shortly expect reactions to our new venture into the American magazine arena. Perspective is certainly not a popular magazine: its target is the large class of intellectuals whose interest is scholarly, and distribution will, in the first instance, be by mailing-list. If such readers can be convinced that here is a magazine presenting the bare facts, uncoloured by party or religious partisanship, of India's culture, literature, economy and science etc., there will eventually be a ready if restricted sale for the magazine. Similarly there will come recognition among India's more scholarly writers that here is an excellent medium for reaching their opposite numbers in America: indeed an increasing flow of contributions indicates that this recognition has already begun. It may be a long time before a popular magazine from India would have much chance of success in the American market. The unfortunate death of The Bugle (See Section B. 8 (d )) has prevented us getting valu able criticisms from Americans in India and any future ventures into this market will start from scratch : how powerful are the radiations of the atomic bomb! 3. China:— The gravest obstacle to the distribution of publicity material in China seems to be the impossibility of getting more than a trickle into the country. There are reports of large quantities of material lying for long periods in Calcutta awaiting transport. Serious though this is, it is not so fatal in the case of India, the articles of which do not date rapidly, but it would kill the interest of a magazine like Dunya which depends for a large measure of its popularity on more or less topical pictures. For this reason the proposal to start a Chinese edition of Dunya is still hanging fire. The suggestions of the staff of the Chinese Commis sioner in Delhi that there should be more Chinese captions in India were fully endorsed by the High Com missioner for India in China on his recent visit, who also spoke of the invaluable part India had played in publicizing India in China. 9. British Commonwealth (excluding India ):— In spite of the approval with which magazines put out by United Publications have been met in the Dominions, little further progress has been made in putting distribution in the various countries on a com mercial basis. Canada, for example, advises against an attempt at commercial distribution at the moment and it seems that a drive in this direction will have to wait till the matter can receive the attention of publicity agents attached to various Commissioners. The placing of publicity magazines on the Commonwealth market will require a certain amount of organization and personal attention to the reactions of the reading public. The Bugle, described in Progress Report No. 18 (Sec-3 tion, A. Paragraph 9) died an unnatural death. There seems little doubt, however, that a popular magazine in English, if edited by a competent staff and written by journalists with a 'slick' touch, would command a ready sale not only throughout the Commonwealth but, if a sufficiently high standard of printing and a sufficiently large run could be maintained) in America also ; and it should be carefully recorded that the decision to discon tinue The Bugle, forced as it was by the end of hostilities, should not prejudice an investigation into the possibili ties for a magazine of a similar type to circulate through out the English-speaking world. As the parts of the British Commonwealth overrun by the Japanese are liberated, the question of Indian pub licity to the liberated areas will come up. Preliminary investigations into the problems of type and compositors show that the difficulties of producing magazines in Far Eastern languages are great; but apart from difficulties of type, the format of the magazine Dunya and the methods by which it is produced make it an ideal vehicle for such publicity work. 10. India:— The end of the war does not present to United Publications a large set of immediate problems for solution. For some months past the contents of the magazines have been made progressively less dependent on war news and the thoughts of the public have been turned to the problems of peace — immediate problems such as resettlement, and long-term problems such as industrial expansion, education, illiteracy etc. United Publications present ideal media in which such pro blems can be discussed and clarified and should, there fore, prove an invaluable asset to any government in building up the post-war India. The main difficulty will be the absence of-an efficient distribution organization inside the country; but we ourselves have taken steps to set on foot the nucleus of such an organization, at least in Ihe cities, and there are signs that a similar organization could be rapidly built up in rural areas. The end of the war will probably see a large increase in the output of pamphlets by departments particularly concerned with immediate post-war problems. Some advantage would be gained by the centralization of a pamphlet producing unit, and it has now been decided that this unit should be located in the Publications Division. The unit will aim at producing one pamphlet a month in English and the question is being investigated of translating these at first into the following languages: Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Gujerati and Tamil. Three of these pamphlets, namely, 400 Millions to be Fed, Post-War Plann ing and The Conquest of Ignorance have already appeared on the market and the responsibility of the Publications Division in connection with these three pamphlets is limited to distribution. B. PRODUCTION. One of the main themes running through all the Pro gress Reports of this Division has been the difficulty of obtaining adequate printing facilities. The end of the war should show some improvement in the position in the not too distant future. But it should be clearly realised that new methods and new processes may have to be developed and expanded in India before the pro ducts of Indian presses can compete on the world mar kets. American magazines that have circulated in the Middle East, for example, show a standard of production probably in advance of anything that has come out o* Indian presses so far, and we have recently seen a magazine designed by the Japanese for publicity in Burma that reaches a high but not necessarily imposs il '*e standard for India. 1. RUSSIAN:- Russian type has been supplied to a large commercial press which has already trained some compositors in its setting. The press is now practically ready to go ahead with printing a Russian version of Indian Studies as a companion to Indian Chronicle. 2. IRANIAN PERSIAN: — (a) Ahang: The new version of Ahang is now ready. It shows a very distinct improvement over the old issues. One of the valuable innovations is the idea of printing in English learned articles by Persian scholars on subjects of historical etc. value which might otherwise not appear in English. Ahang is also being used as an unofficial organ of the Indo-Iranian Cultural Society and it is hoped to print regular reports on its working. • The editor has received a severely critical letter from a well-known Persian author complaining that his article was severely cut; the article was, however, printed by us exactly as it was received and a soothing letter has been sent to the author. ( b) The Persian version of India's Natural Resources will be out early in October. (c) The Persian version of India 1945 is also expected early in October. (d) The decision has been taken to discontinue the Bugle Library Series ' A 3. AFGHAN PERSIAN:- It is hoped that we shall shortly have authentic reac tions to Taj Mahal from Kabul. When these are received it will be possible to make, if necessary, changes in the get- up of the magazine to make it more'popular in that country. 4. PUSHTU :- Reactions to ZhtUfind are still difficult to obtain and hard to evaluate. The magazine has been sent to Kabul4 where one or two minor criticisms were made about the style of the Pushtu which was described as similar both in diction and calligraphy to the Pushtu of Peshawar. As the magazine is wholly meant for the North West Frontier Province it would be a mistake to make changes that would offend this public; but if Afghanistan is ever able to give free access to our publications it is highly likely that Zhwand will enjoy there as much popularity as in the N. W. F. — in spite of the 'Peshawari-isms.' 5- ARABIC:— (a) Al Arab. The Editor of Al Arab has visited various places in India where Arabic tradition is strongest. (Inci dentally, the value of editors engaged in projecting India to foreign countries touring throughout the country is very great and we have been able to arrange for several ci»pur editors to visit parts of India. The General Editor Gudia) has also visited senior officers in the provinces with very encouraging results: United Publications are gradually becoming better known and wherever they are known they seem to be appreciated.) The popularity of Al Arab is increasing and its influence is being felt far beyond the Persian Gulf for which it was originally intended. Indeed, Bagdad reports that sales of Al Arab during the period under review have increased at Aden where the magazine is penetrating into Southern Arabia. (b) Copies are expected early in October of the Arabic version of India 1945. (c) The Bugle Library Series “ A ” has been discontinued. 6. URDU:— (a) Ajkdl. Some criticisms were made of the uneven g*»ality of the Ajkal Annual Number. This unevenness was due to the fact that it was printed in more than one press. In spite of the popularity of annual numbers, problems of production and distribution cause so much disturbance to the ordinary programme that it is very doubtful whether they are worth while in their present form. A more practical proposition might be to intro duce colour insets into the Annual Number instead of large quantities of extra matter. (b) NdUnihdl. The present print order is 9,000. A sales drive would multiply the sales of this magazine many times, but unless it is decided to print the magazine by another process the problem of producing very large runs on our own presses is a very difficult one. From the November issue Naunihal will appear with an entirely new cover; the letterpress will be increased and also the price. 7. HINDI:— Although there has been some drop in the sales of Ajkal ( Hindi) paradoxically enough its popularity seems to be at last firmly established. This popularity is evi denced by very favourable reviews in various magazines and also by the increased willingness of well-known writers to contribute to it. 8. ENGLISH:— (a) Soviet Union News and foreign Review. No strong criticisms of the magazine in its new form have been voiced. It has, therefore, been decided to bring out, as from 1st January, 1946, the magazine in a revised form:— (i) It will be called Foreign Review ( incorporating Soviet Union News) ; the phrase in brackets will be dropped after one or two issues. (H) The general policy will be to present the English-speaking public with factual information in a popular form about foreign countries in general and India's neighbours in particular. There will be four sections:— (I) U. S. S. R.. America and the British Common wealth. (2) Other countries (China to be featured in every other issue). (3) 'As Others See Us'—reports of references to India in the foreign press. (4) A literary section. (iVi) The front cover will be re-designed but will keep the predominant colours of the present magazine. (to) The price will be raised to As. - 6 -. (b) Heyday. (English version of Naunihal). Like its brother Naunihal, Heyday will appear in November with a completely new cover. The Annual Number will have a colour inset, and the price will also be raised to As. 4 -. So great is the popularity of this magazine both inside and outside India that we anticipate that the increase in price will not keep the print order down low enough for it to continue to be printed by the present method. The sales could be increased almost indefinitely and it may be immediately necessary to consider other methods of production. Heyday and Naunihal invite contributions from their youthful readers, and a fair number of praiseworthy efforts have been printed just as they have been received. Cases occur, however, of children copying articles from little-known books and sending them up as their own work, so that it is often difficult to decide how original a contribution is. A case has also recently occurred of an article sent in which proved good enough for inclusion after a great deal of editorial work had been done on it. When the article had appeared, the Editor received letters from the author—who proved to be an adult — demanding money for his contribution. When we replied that it was our policy to pay for contributed5 articles only if they had been especially requested, two strong criticisms of the Editor appeared in small provin cial newspapers. Perhaps we have not heard the last of the enterprising ' child (c) Perspective. The first issue of this magazine has now appeared. A good deal of difficulty was experien ced in finding a press capable of producing it to the re quired standard and with the required speed. But the first issue seems quite satisfactory, though a criticism has been voiced that the qover is too light for the contents. The tours undertaken by the Editor of this magazine have resulted in a large number of well-known figures agreeing to contribute and no fears are now entertained that there will be difficulty about the standard or the number of contributions. (d) The Bugle. The material for the first issue of The Bugle proved none too easy to obtain. The target was to have been in particular troops in India, and in general England, America and the Commonwealth: for such an audience articles were required to be written in a very facile and easy style and the make-up of the magazine had to have no trace of amateur work. Difficulties were experienced in obtaining the required standard either in diction or in make-up. Then news was received of the end of hostilities and the probable withdrawal of large sections of the public for whom the magazine was inten ded. It was therefore decided to abandon the idea entirely of producing an all-English magazine of this type. It was later decided that in view of the work which had already been undertaken in the production of this magazine, one single edition of The Bugle should appear, and this, will be ready by the middle of October. (e) Onward; The first issue of this new magazine for women is expected in September, dated October. There has been a very good response to requests fer contribu tions and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu has written a foreword .for it. (/) India. We had fallen a good deal behind in the production of this magazine but have now managed to catch up and the October issue will be on time, as already indicated. More Chinese is being introduced into it. ($) Map of India’s Resources. This has provoked favour able comment and enquiries have been received as to the possibility of producing a similar map devoted entirely to food. There is also a possibility of producing by rotogravure in collaboration with P. I. O., posters suitable for schools etc., on geographical or historical subjects. [h) Two pamphlets will be ready early in October: What's in an Indian Name, by Col. Gifford, which deals with the meaning of names, both of people and places in India, and Studies in Russian History by Nicholas Ruskin, reprinting a series of popular articles first published in Soviet Union News. 0. SHAIPU&amp; &amp; AL NAEIfe. The causes of the drop in sales of Shaipur and Al Nafir have been referred to in various places in the course of this Report. It will be useful to summarise them here: (а) Lack of money to spend on so-called luxury articles. (б) Increased competition from new magazines started both by indigenous publishers (this applies more parti cularly to .4/ Nafir) and by foreign publishers. (c) The excellent colour work of some competing magazines produced at great expense and sold at much below cost price. (d) The small number of themes near to the Persian or Iraqi heart: this is largely due to the increasing difficulty of finding stocks of fresh pictures of the countries concerned. (e) Difficulties and delays in distribution (this app..us more especially to Iran). (/) The soft-pedalling of sex-appeal. To offset this, the magazine can perhaps be produced on better paper with an attractive colour inset, probably of an Indian painting; and it may prove necessary to keep prices down in view of the cheap and sometimes free distribution of publicity material by other countries. Indeed, an important lesson for India is the amount of money foreign countries are prepared to spend on well- produced publicity material. 10. DUNYA — a bilingual magazine in separate English Rmsian, English - Roman Urdu, English-■ Persian, Urdu-Pushtu and English-Hindi editions. The criticism made in the last Progress Report that Dunya contains too many war pictures will automatically cease now that hostilities are over. The seven p age s devoted to the Indian Armed Forces have been cut at .e request of Directorate of Public Relations, G.H.Q. (India) to four, and it is hoped to devote most of these to resettlement and reconstruction schemes. The Hindi edition of Dunya referred to in Progress Report No. 18, B, 10, has been accorded a warm welcome. The recent tour made by the General Editor (India ) of the Publications Division serves to show how popular Dunya would be throughout the whole of India if a proper large-scale distribution organization can be set on foot. The sale of one copy in each village of India automatically means a print order of half a million copies. At the same time experiments have proved that simple as is the reading-matter of Dunya it needs simplifying still more before it will be a completely suitable vehicle for villages. It has already been mentioned how excellent a medium it will be also for Far Eastern distribution and investigations into the possibilities of Chinese, Tibetan, Malayan and Burmese editions have already made a good deal of progress.6 (. SHO&amp;T STORES. United Publications believes that a great wealth of good literature lies hidden in Indian languages. It is true that there have been several collections of short stories translated into English from various Indian languages, but we are not convinced that the best selection has always been made of the material available or that translations have always been of a uniformly high standard. Moreover, short stories in, for example, Malayalam, may never have been translated into Urdu or Hindi even if they have appeared in English, and very rarely indeed have they appeared in such languages as Persian, Arabic or Russian. United Publications believe that they would be doing a good service to the cause of literature in general if these stories were made more widely available. We therefore propose to conduct some detailed r—earch into the material available in short stories in ah the principal Indian languages, and to translate ^ the best of these into Urdu, Hindi, English, Persian, Arabic and Russian. The pick of the collection will then be re-published in an anthology in such languages as seem most suitable. This is quite an ambitious project and we hope to &gt; have the co-operation of scholars and societies through out India. D. ADVERTISEMENTS. The machinery for using United Publications as advertising media is now in full swing. Rate-cards and circular letters have been prepared in consultation with our advertising representative and a small but steady trickle of advertisements has already begun to flow in. Some delay was caused at the start of the campaign as we had hoped that The Bugle in its three editions, Arabic, Persian and English would be the main vehicle for our external advertising. The decision, therefore, to abandon the English version meant that most of the work in preparation for the campaign had to be abandoned and a new start made on the basis of two versions only, the Arabic and the Persian. It has been laid down as a principle that advertise ments will be accepted from foreign firms in magazines circulating in India only if they deal in Indian products and that advertisements will be accepted from foreign firms in magazines circulating outside India provided that their goods do not enter into competition with Indian goods. E. COPYRIGHT. The scheme of translating Indian short stories outlined in Section C has brought up in an acute form the whole question of copyright. In common with other magazines engaged in furthering the war effort, we have been in the habit occasionally in the past of reprinting in trans lations—with due acknowledgments—tonic articles from our contemporaries. We now have to review the whole question of copyright in connection with articles appearing in all our magazines, whether in English, Persian, Arabic, Russian, or Indian languages. We are receiving help from a scheme recently devised whereby we are allowed by A.I.R. to use for the purpose of magazine publicity, talks delivered over the air and copyright questions have been very amicably settled in connection with these scripts. If this scheme can be satisfactorily organized we shall find at our disposal a large new source of excellent material. F 'sd : 1st October 1945 (Sd.) W. LYNNDON CLOUGH* * Col.

(5b • PROGRESS REPORT No. 20 U 4 The last Progress Report on the work of the Publications Division was submitted on 1. 10. 45. 61 I \ ♦Publications Division Progress Report No. 20 for the period ending 31-12-45. A. GENERAL SITUATION. 1. U.S.S.R. There are again no direct reactions from Russia to our material supplied there. It appears that there seems to have been some misunderstanding about the distribu tion of our Russian material in the U.S.S.R. through the Ministry of Information. It has been learned that the latter ruled that their representative in Moscow was not to take up this question w ith the Soviet Government on our behalf; but unfortunately we were not informed of this and have up to the present time been under the impression that the Ministry of Information in Moscow was, at a convenient opportunity, going to take up the matter with the Soviet Government. It had been hoped that the Director of this Division would visit Moscow and straighten out the position personally. Various factors, however, have prevented this visit and at the moment there seems to be no change to report in the situation described in Progress Report No. 19. The discovery of the misunderstanding which has arisen between ourselves and the Ministry of Infor mation will almost certainly mean that the distribution of our various Russian magazines in Russia could now be taken up with the Soviet Government, and it is hoped that an immediate improvement in the situation would result. 2. Persia Our Cassandra-like prophecies in the last Progress Report have come only too true: the situation in Persia has deteriorated very considerably in the period under review. Our sales in Tabriz, the chief city of Azerbaijan, were always extremely encouraging and it was here that a good deal of our Russian material was sold. Before the disturbances in this province, sales had been steadily increasing and it was hoped that the new distribution arrangements (which will be explained later) would set United Publications on a firm basis there. It is still too early to say whether all hope of this must be abandoned but it is certain that the steady work of building up sales will be seriously disturbed. It is still too early also to predict what reactions the Azerbaijan disturbances will have in the rest of Persia. The loss of Azerbaijan would almost certainly mean a large increase in the already inflated prices of food and other essential materials; this in turn will diminish the money available for the purchase of magazines. The immediate departure of a Publicity Officer to Tehran will mean, however, that we can get quicker and more detailed reactions to our magazines which will enable us toimake them more generally acceptable to the public for whom they are intended. While the Director was in Persia, he took the oppor tunity of discussing the whole question of Indian publicity in Persia with various officials of H. M. G., and recom mendations were sent in which may result in an improve ment in the general position. 3. Persian Gulf:— There seems to be no improvement in the speed with which publications reach Bushire by sea or by post. There are still complaints of the late arrival of material. 4. Iraq:— The colour pictures) which seem to be a bait foi ihe Iraqi market, are to be increased by the addition of a _ series or colour insets. The first of these series will con sist of six pictures reproduced from well-known Indian paintings. The proofs of some of these paintings have already come to hand and they are remarkably good. It is hoped to start these insertions from No. 53 of Al Nafir, and it is confidently expected that they will go a long way towards increasing the sale of this magazine in Iraq. If they are successful, it is proposed to follow up this first series by a second series giving views of striking landscapes in India. The popularity of United Publications throughout the whole of the Arabic-speaking world, in spite of the increased competition and the lack of ready money in the countries concerned, is proved by the number of requests we have recently received from agents asking for our distribution terms. 5. Afghanistan:— There is no change in the present situation. 6. North West frontier:— Interest still continues to be maintained in Zhwand- We have made enquiries into the possibility of distri buting Dunya (Urdu-Pushtu) in the North West Frontier through the kind offices of the Field Publicity Organiza tion. The response in this particular district was disappointing, as the standard of literacy was said to be so low that reading matter was not required. This view is not completely borne out by reactions to Zhwand. 7. U.S.A. :— Reactions to Perspective have not yet come to hand from America, though comments from Americans in India, from Indians themselves and from England have been very encouraging. There has been no difficulty whatsoever over contributions, ^which continue to arrive in ever-increasing numbers. &lt;T2 No decision can yet be taken as to whether it will eventually be possible or desirable to reprint Perspective in America, though copies on special paper were sent early in October to Washington in order that the ques tion might be examined. There are certain minor technical details relating to federal law in America which have to be complied with before distribution on any scale can be commenced. At the moment we are relying on a large mailing list compiled by the Indian Information Office in Washing ton for spreading the magazine before the intellectuals of the country. 5. China The Publicity Officer for China has been sent to Chungking. He will be able to give us first hand reports and reactions as to the value of India, and the decision to start a Chinese edition of Dunya is being deferred until thi/*^fficer can give us his advice on the matter. 0. far East:— The opening up of Burma and Malaya is in progress. Publicity Officers are being sent to both places; and their instructions as far as this office is concerned are to contact agents who might prove interested in the marketing of magazines in English in the first instance; and secondly, to look into the possibilities of producing magazines in Far Eastern languages specially directed to certain countries or certain communities in Burma and Malaya. The visit of an officer to Burma brought back the information that there appear to be good possibilities for the sales of such magazines as Dunya, the Bugle and India, if they were modified to meet local conditions. 10. British Commonwealth (excluding India) The appointment of an Information Officer to Australia will give us an opportunity of assessing the ^val 'of material from India distributed in that country. The Director of the Publications Division has examined in England the possibility of distributing material there. Material such as Indian Studies and India 1945 might be suitable for the English market, the latter particularly if it is produced in a form more to the English taste. It has been suggested that before the material is put on sale on a large scale, the experiment should be tried for a few months of distributing a large amount of free copies of material in English,- and this proposal is being carefully examined. Meanwhile, United Publications in England will be on sale at Messrs Luzac Co., 46 Great Russell Street, London. A letter has also been received from the Director, The Imperial Institute, South Kensington, who has suggested that his Institute should be regarded as the main channel for the distribu- in England of material produced in India. The fact, however, has become increasingly clear that the material at present produced in English is not completely suitable for England, probably unsuitable for the British Commonwealth, and (except for Perspective and some similar items), quite certainly not suitable for America. The lack of a magazine or magazines to be distributed in these parts of the world is being keenly felt. The problems involved in such magazines are not easy of solution, for the countries concerned are for the most part used to “ slick ” journalism, elaborate and expensive formats and a very high technical standard, none of which is readily available in India as yet on a cheap scale. We have just seen an excellent reprint made in Australia of a booklet originally produced by this office on the Indian Army, Swords and Ploughshares 11. India:— The number of our agents in the various cities of India is gradually incresing and sales continue satis factorily with small fluctuations. It seems that the time has now come for a very strong drive to increase the print orders of such magazines as Ajkal and Heydagf Naunihal, especially as it seems that improved facilities for production may be expected to become fairly rapidly available. There are hopful signs that the problem of rural disribution is well on its way to solution: this matter will be discussed under a separate heading, “ Distribution ”. B. PRODUCTION AND REACTIONS. The hopes expressed in Progress Report No. 19 that the difficulty of obtaining adequate printing facilities might end soon after the close of hostilities have been confirmed rather than disappointed in the past three months. In the first place it seems likely that printing machinery will become more rapidly available than was at first feared. It is no exageration to say that this Division has worked miracles with antique machinery and with old-fashioned methods of composing and printing. The need foi modernizing our own press can almost be described as desperate, and there are hopes that the machinery so urgently required will be found. Military and official presses in certain numbers have been set up both in India and the Middle East during the war; some of this machinery has already come on to the market, and though we were too late to obtain this, there are signs that the supply is by no means exhausted. In the second place, the prospect is opening up before us of printing a good deal of our high-class pub licity material on very modern photo litho offset machines available to the Government. Work already done by these machines has very considerably improved the covers of Ajkal (Urdu and Hindi), Hey day! Naunihal and has adorned the cover of Onward. Various colour pictures and a calendar have also been producedby this method, and if such results can be maintained, they will enable India to set a standard of printing second to none in Asia. 1. RUSSIAN:— Indian Chronicle No. 3 appeared in November. As has been reported, very few direct reactions to this magazine can be obtained, but from Tabriz came the statement that “the impression made by Indian Chronicle, though good, seems to have been on a very small scale.” This of course is to be understood, as the high academic tone of the magazine limits its appeal. 2. IRANIAN PERSIAN (а) Ahanq: The new/Man# has met with considerable approval in India: copies have gone off to Persia and reactions from there are awaited. The new format seems to make the magazine easier to handle than before, though it is perhaps a little too thick. The new method of printing the English and Persian in the bidingual section in parallel columns, while increasing the value of the magazine to those who use it as a means of studying English, increases also the difficulties of production. Reactions are still coming in to the old Ahang. Delays in its receipt are reported from Bushire: in Kerman it is said to be ‘‘successful with students but has a very limited appeal”. (б) The Persian version of India's Natural Resources and of India 1945 have both been received and despatched to Persia. (c) The version of Gullivers Travels published in Bugle Library Series “A” proved popular in Bushire. 3. AEGHAN PERSIAN:— There is some indication that Taj Mahal is making its way slowly in Afghanistan, and copies of the magazine sent under the new distribution system are now being received through the post by the addressees. It is still a popular magazine in Persia though its style, written as it is in the Persian of Afghanistan, is occasion ally found hard to understand. The Basic English lessons finished as a course with lesson No. 15, but it has been decided to continue the four-page English supplement on the following lines: the first two pages will give revision exercises in Basic English for those whose main interest is in Basic English; while the second two will provide a course in “wider English” adapted for Afghan readers from the ex cellent booklets authorized by the Orthological Institute. 4. PUSHTU:- Some difficulties have been encountered in obtaining qualified calligraphists, but these have now been solved. It is hoped to produce an annual number of Zhtoand in March 1946 and preparations for this number are already being made. 5. Arabic:— The appearance of Al Arab has been much improved by a cover produced by the photo litho offset method. Enquiries for the magazine have already been made from Singapore and the copies that have gone there have been appreciated. The magazine is therefore making its in-, fluence felt from Malaya to Morocco. {b) The response to the Arabic version of /rafi’a- 1945 has been disappointing. Both Bushire and Cairo feel themselves unable to sell copies except at a remarkably low figure, owing to the alleged lack of interest in things Indian. This lack of interest may be a real fact, but the enquiries received from booksellers who are anxious to obtain agencies for United Publications in the Arab world suggest that the interest is not as insignificant as is often supposed. 6. Urdu:— (a) Ajkal. In this magazine too, the new cover^re reported to be a “distinct improvement”. The editor of this magazine receives regularly each month well over 500 letters of appreciation (and some times criticism !) and many Urdu magazines pay it the compliment of reproducing articles, generally with full acknowledgements. Some of the letters received make amusing reading: one reader likes Ajkal “particularly because it does not entertain obscene articles and adver tisements ” ; another is “ so much addicted to Ajkal that unless he reads it he cannot digest his food”; yet another finds in himself after studying very carefully “ a craving to become a writer ”, and in the final example there is a little sting: “ May God grant you strength enough to serve literature more”. In a poll recently taken in the Punjab to test the popularity of various magazines, Ajkal was placed second to another United Publications, Dunya, which cam^rst. /** ib) Naunihal. In the last Progress Report, it was announced that Naunihal would appear from November with an entirely new cover, an increase in the letterpress and in the price. The increase in price has not driven down the sales as much as was anticipated, largely owing, we imagine, to the excellence both of the design and of the printing of the cover. The last Progress Report referred to a contributor to this magazine who had worked up a case against the Editor when an article which he had sent in did not receive the payment to which he thought he was entitled. We prophesied then that we had not heard the last of the “ enterprising child ”—child because the Editor accepted the article as if from one of the young readers of the magazine. This prophecy has proved only too true, for the contributor turned out to be a fully- fledged journalist who used the full strength of his organization to start in various Urdu newspapers acampaign which can only be regarded as malicious against the Editor of Namihal. The campaign assumed consider^ able proportions and is still going on. 7. Hindi:— , . The drop in the sales of Ajkal (Hindi) has been arrested and the tide definitely turned in the opposite direction. Z. English:— (a) foreign Devieuj. The first issue of Foreign Revieto is now in the press. There is every indication that its new form will make it considerably superior to Soviet Union News &amp; Foreign Review in its interest value. The cover will be in two colours. There is every reason to believe that these improvements will justify the increase in price. (A) Heyday (English version of Namihal). The success of this magazine abroad is even more striking than its popularity in India. Persia reports that the irregularity of^eceipt hinders large sales from being obtained but the numerous enquiries that are made about it when it is late in arriving testify to its popularity. One reason for its late arrival in Meshed was the fact that the P. R. B. lorry service was inadequate to cope with the gradual accumulation of supplies in Zahidan. In Kerman the supply of the magazine has not been equal to the demand. Complaints such as these will disappear, we hope, when the new distribution system is working efficiently. Certain criticisms have been made about the style, language and contents of both Heyday and Namihal. It is no easy matter to produce a magazine which will be of equal interest to, and equally easily understood by children between the ages of six and fourteen, who comprise much of our “target”. Some valuable criti cisms, however, have been recently received which appear to suggest that the language, particularly of Nqunihal, is too difficult, and we shall aim at a more si» ^lifted diction. The “ Nauday League” has been started in connection with the two magazines; a badge is being made for sale to members and various ambitious schemes are being considered of linking up with the League plans for a film society, etc. The response to such a league gives a useful indication of the wide distribution of the magazines. (c) Perspective. Two issues of this magazine have now appeared and we are waiting for reactions from America. (d) The Bugle. The single issue appeared in November and has had a mixed reception. It appears, however, to be a well produced and interesting magazine and it is on linesisimilar to these that material should be pro duced for the English-speaking markets outside India. (e) OnUJdrd. Two issues of Onward have now appeared and the third is in the press. Articles from contributors are coming forward well. Some difficulty is being expe rienced in recruiting an adequate staff which will fully represent all shades of women’s opinion In India. There was some delay in bringing out the first number of Onward and it has not proved easy to deal with the magazine under our present press arrangements. This points to an urgent need in our Production Section for more modern machinery. Delay was also caused by the absence of certain letters which were not supplied with the special fount of type that had been ordered for this magazine. (/) India. We have now managed to catch up more or less with the lag in the production of this magazine by bringing out the September and October issue in one. (g) The following subjects were dealt with in the Mizan Newsletter during the period under review:— October — Book on India. November — Civil Aviation. December — Archaeology. (h) What's in an Indian Name? produced as a pamphlet in October, has been extremely successful and a reprint may shortly be necessary. (i) Studies in Russian History appeared in November and is on the market. (j) The final proofs have recently been passed of Indim Studies. This is a reprint of the series of four smaller booklets which have appeared under the same title. The contents have been rearranged so as to fall under several headings, such as cultural, religious, mili tary, economic etc. In its present form this book will give the earnest student of Indian affairs a very reliable background of objective facts. 9. SHAIPUB &amp; AL NAEIP. Persia continues to report favourably on Shaipur and the popularity of the maga zine has very definitely increased throughout the whole of Persia during the period under review. The “intro duction of literary articles has proved a popular addition,” while on the other hand, the gradual disappearance of pin-up girls “is noted with regret by younger readers’’. Particularly large increases were shown in the Tabriz district which makes the present situation in Persia all the more unfortunate from our point of view. In one area of Persia it was discovered that some of the agents had been giving copies of Shaipm out on hire to customers. A seal was placed on all copies of the magazine and this proceeding produced spectacular results: all the consignment of two issues of Shaipur was immediately sold out and sales increased by almost 300%. In view of this report and at the request of our new distribution agents, seals have been placed on all copies of Shaipur. It has now been found possible to include in Shaipar certain Persian features which will not appear in Al Ntrfn, and in Al Nafir certain Arab features which will not appear in Shaipur. Furthermore, the attractive weries5 of inset* described in paragraph A. 4 should further increase the popularity of the magazine- There is still, however, a crying need for more Middle East photo graphs. This poverty we have always with us. We get suggestions, for example, from Persia that “pictures showing machinery and industry would be suitable and popular”. 10: DUNYA:- (a) Enqlish-Persidn. All reactions tend to show that this magazine has grown in popularity in Persia and that if the contents remain stable it will establish itself. Dunya No. 8, which had a frontispiece of the Queen of Iran, was extremely popular, though again in certain places the difficulties of distribution have prevented high sales. The suggestion has been received that “the editorial in Dunya should be longer and fuller”: there is no edito rial ! If by ‘‘editorial” type-matter is meant we are aware that increase in this respect might prove popular in some places. High hopes are expressed for the future popularity of the magazine in several parts of Persia. (b) Enqlish-Bussion. The magazine was selling extre mely well in Azerbaijan. It is too early to say what effect political conditions will have on its continuance. In any case the print order of the Russian edition is not large enough to make it a completely satisfactory run on a rotogravure machine. We are therefore trying the experiment of having the pictures printed by roto gravure and the type-matter overprinted by letterpress. (q) Enqlish-Hindi. Reactions to this edition of Dunya have been extremely disappointing. The drop in sales was due to several factors, among which the distribution of the magazine to the army and the prior appearance of the English-Roman Urdu issue were two of the most important. We have now found it possible to bring out the English-Hindi and the English-Roman Urdu editions at approximately the same time, so that the sales of the former are not damaged by those of the latter. (d) EnqlisMoman Urdu- Large quantities of this maga zine are still being taken by the armed forces. Some difficulties were experienced in making certain that the language and transliteration of the Roman-Urdu should be most satisfactory from the point of view of the military, who are its principal purchasers. It has not yet been found possible for them to continue to do the actual translation ; this is somewhat unfortunate. (e) Urdu-Pushtu. No change. (/) Enqlish-Burmese. It is expected that Dunya No- 14 can be brought out in this edition. It has proved impossible to obtain type or compositors for this magazine and for a few months at least we shall have to have recourse to the expedient of calligraphing the Burmese translation and printing it from blocks. This will be done by the same method as the overprinting of the English-Russian. The first set of calligraphed trans lation has been received and has proved a really artistic production. (g) If the experiment of calligraphing the Burmese edi tion of Dunya proves a success* an edition on similar lines in Tibetan will ’also be produced. Experiments are in hand with Tibetan calligraphists and translators to see what modifications, if any, the different structure of the language will require. C DISTRIBUTION. The problems of the distribution of United Publications fall into three classes : distribution abroad, in urban,India and in rural India. The cessation of hostilities has increased rather than diminished the difficulties of external distribution. The problem as far as Persia is concerned has been solved^by entrusting the sales of our magazines to a sole agei n Tehran. The material reaches Tehran, however, by an extremely complicated system of boat and train ^ services which never promise to follow a regular schedule, and under the present political circumstances may become very confused. It is possible that the method of entrusting our material to agents may even tually provide the best solution for sales throughout the entire Arabic-speaking world. The Director of the Publications Division has investigated the possibilities of of this method while away on deputation. When normal shipping services are restored to Burma and Malaya, little difficulty should be experienced in these countries, but at the moment we are very much rest ricted by the postal proviso that parcels must not weigh more than 4$ lbs: any distribution on a large scale under these circumstances is-obviously impossible, but there are already hopeful signs that large agencies in both of t ^e ^ countries are anxious to obtain the sole agency of United Publications. The Director has investigated in England the possi- blity of putting all United Publications on the market in that country. ln£urban India, the problem can be met with reason able ease by the creation of large number of agencies in the various towns. The setting up of these agencies is being proceeded with. The only magazine at present produced by United Publications which is at all suitable for rural India is Dunya, in one or another of its language combinations. Here we have obtained the very welcome cooperation of the Field Publicity Organisation in our efforts to sell this magazine in the villages. Various methods of which the most satisfactory is that copies should be supplied in bulk to the organizers who will distribute them through any kind of agency whatsoever on a A Acommission basis. We are now trying to see if this scheme can be operated in all the provinces (with the exception of Bombay, Madras and the North West Frontier Province, who are not interested in this scheme). D. PAMPHLET SECTION The Production Section working with the Bureau of Public Information has been officially transferred to the Publications Division. The three pamphlets produced by this section under the old arrangement, namely, 400 Millions to be Fed ”, Conquest of Ignor ance ” and “ Post-war Planning ”, have proved popular. The first pamphlet to appear under the new arrangement is “ Safeguards for Peace ”, which gives in convenient from the full text of the document signed at San Francisco on 26th June 1945. Work has begun on a pamphlet dealing with India’s communications and another one on India’s industry'. Both of these pam- ph&gt;*&lt;s will shortly be ready for the press. No decision has yet been taken as to whether these pamphlets will be produced in languages other than English. E. TOUPS The end of the war has enabled officers of this Division to undertake a few tours, a duty which had been neglected during hostilities. The tours are orga nized, broaJly speaking, on two lines: editors whose Dated: 1st January, 1946. work it is to interpret modern India to the outside world are encouraged to visit places in India, a report on which will interest the readers in the countries to which each editor’s magazines are directed. On this basis, the editor of Al Arab some time ago visited Bahawalpur and the editor of Ahang attended a P. E. N. conference at Jaipur, and has also visited places of Persian interest in and around Bombay. The other basis on which the tours are arranged is for officers to contact all agencies through out India likely to be interested in the sale or distribution of United Publications. The tours undertaken on this basis have been particularly successful and it is gratifying to report that United Publications are popular through out India, and promises have been received of active support from the provinces. Extremely instructive criticisms and reactions are also obtained from these tours. One of the suggestions of real interest made to an officer on tour was that a Hindi edition of Heyday should be produced. . There are technical difficulties involved in this, but the suggestion has been sympatheti cally considered. Our photographers also carry out specific tours: in this respect our organisation has been considerably strengthened by the addition to the staff of a very compe tent and well-known photographer.

It is a great pleasure to me and t# my #olleagues, 3Ir Stafford Gripps, and Mr* Alexander, to visit your country at a time ®f such crucial importance in its history. I was myself last in India in 1926 and I then made many friends with whtm I have since kept in cons tant touch. Sir Stafford Cripps is well known to you from his visit in 1942 and his earlier unofficial visit in 1940* Mr. Alexander has not before had the pleasure of visiting your oonntry, but he is a good friend of India w*.th a deep and sympathetic interest in your problems* The Viceroy, while continuing to carry the full load of his normal responsibilities, will join with us as •ur colleague in tjie dis : cussioas- with Indian leaders for which the Mission has come here. ^ With one or two exceptions all the results of the provincial elections 'will be known fcy the end of the next ten days. We shall therefore 'begin our consultations a week from today * In the meantime I and my colleagues will be engaged in bringing ourselves u? date with the situation, aid in conferring with His Excellency the Viceroy amd i with the Governors of Provinces wh* are coming to Delhi to see us. We are looking forward t# meeting with the Executive Oouaoil tomorrow evening. a, You aH know the general purpose of the disoussions on which we shall be engaged. It k was stated by Mr. Attlee, our Prime Minister in his speech in the House of Commons on March I5th» The disoussions now to begin are preliminary to the setting up of machinery •whereby the forms under which India can‘realise her full independent status can be determined by Indians. The objective is to set up an aocept- able machinery quickly,- and *0 make the necessary interim, arrangements. 4^ Mr. Attlee in his speeoh which, in the subsequent debate, was shown to represent 'substantiallsr'the- / views of all parties,; made it quite clear that if Indians should’ decide that they desire., under their new constitutional arrangements, to *be outside'the British-a- Commoiiwealth o£ Nations, M^G r - ivim,gni .gp--4 ±l^ 1 n-T-ighi&gt;-to—■ that decision. We believe ourselves that India will find great advantages in remaining within the free association of the British Commonwealth, But it is a free association, and we have no desire to press India to sta.y within it against her considered, judgment* 5, The issue of freedom and self-determination is therefore settled in principle. We have now to work out in ^-operation the means by which Indians can themselvos decide the form of their new institutions with the minimum of disturbance and the maximum of speed* The''Indian States, which xnave a great part to play .in Inclia f s . future, must clearly be invited to join in this task. We are ^'encouraged by the knowledge that many of the Rulers share the general — desire for.the immediate attainment by India of her full freedom* • in the meanwhile it is most desirable that a more representative Government-having full popular support 'should -come ixi± 0 -...being._.at.uthe Centre so as to bring the country through its period of transition. It is of the greatest importance that the transfer of responsibility should be smoothly and efficiently carried through. This is primarily an Indian,but also a British, interest, and it will be a - fresh source of pride to India and to Britain if we can demonstrate. ,^to the world our ability to make a smooth and peaoeiul change of so far-reaching a character. It is to tnat end that we have come to play what we hope will be a helpful part&lt;^ 6. Our talks will not be concorned with Vh^ question of whether India shall determine her own destiny - that Vi-4 already decided - but with how she will do so. My colleagues and 'J look with confidence therefore to you, who represent the great Indian Vress of all-.shades of -opinion, to exercise with helpfulness and restraint the far- reaching influence .which you have in public affairs. There is no doubt that there are difficult questions which must be solved. During' our talks we shall all need patience, tolerance, and a • spirit of compromise; and your co-operation in achieving andmaintaining this helpful spirit of co-operation will greatly assist our task. I have no doubt that success in our joint task is attainable provided that all of us set the good of the Indian people above any other interest, and that we let nothing interfere with our determination to solve the problem. 7. You already know the programme which we have arranged for the beginning of our discussions. We shall be collecting the views of representatives of the Provincial and Central Legislatures, of the leading all-India parties and organisations, and of Indian States. We have of course followed closely the statements of policy of the main parties and the important utterances of Indian leaders, but there are many'matters which we. shall need to discuss before we can feel that we have obtained a full appreciation of all points of view. These interviews will occupy a great deal of our time until about the middle of April, and our programme after that will depend on developments. 8. There are two matters connected with our programme that I should like to mention today. We are receiving a great number of requests from organisations and individuals all over India who wish us to hear their views in person. I must make it quite clear that I and my colleagues have come here for the single purpose which I have already described to you. We have no wish to deny a hearing to anyone, but it is quite impossible for us to meet all who would wish us to see them. We shall therefore limit ourselves to seeing those who are judged to be best able to help us in our task. Moreover I, as Secretary of State, shall not be able to give interviews on matters outside the work for which the Cabinet Delegation have come here; all such matters must be dealt with by the G-ovemment of India, or the Crown Representative in the normal way. I fear that we shall have also to disappoint the great majority of the many kind people who are sending us social invitations. They will I am sure realise that we have a very heavy, programme and thatit xs^nec^^ar7H&gt;&lt;&gt;ui^'ote--aIXjcKir^^ergija5^ task in , hand, 9. My colleagues and I do not propose to hold Press i Conferences on regular dates, but from time to time when we feel that we caS usefully meet you we shall invite you to come, Mr. Joyce, who is well known to many of you, is Principal Information Officer to the Delegation, and he will hold more frequent conferences to keep you in touch with developments. I am sure you will appreciate that during our visit we shall be unable to give exclusive interviews for publication to any Individual correspondent. We are anxious that all sections » •f the Press, and the representatives of broadcasting organisations, should be treated with complete impartiality, and the only ^satisfactory way of achieving this is of course by the Press ^ Conference procedure. But we hope we shall have opportunities of meeting you informally and off the record* 10. We cannot of course at this meeting express any views either on the shape of the machinery that should be devised for determining a solution, or on the merits of any particular constitutional plan. These are matters which must await the discussions with Indian representatives. We have come with only one fixed intention, and that is to play our full part ^as representing His Majesty r s Government in helping Indians to achieve their independence. Beyond that wo have, open minds and are not committed to any particular views. But that does not mean that we come in a hesitant or indecisive frame- of mind. We .come to enable Indians to take their place and play their full part amongst the great nations of the world; and with the determination to bring our-discussions to a decisive and friendly conclusion we hope with the goodwill of all the inhabitants of this great country. 11. We shall now be happy to try and deal with your : . . questions. • .mmmmm Secret PUBLICATIONS DIVISION Information &amp; Broadcasting Department Government of India Progress Report No&lt;^ (Serial ?.;,o fojj ) is sent herewith* please acknowledge receipt. PROGRESS REPORT No. 21 The last Progress Report on the work of the Publications Division was submitted on 31. 12. 45.Publications Division Progress Report No. 21 for the Period ending 31-3-46. A. mm SITUATION. 1 . u. No improvement has taken place in the situation regarding the distribution of Indian publicity material in the U.S.S.R. Briefly, the situation is that no distribution of Government of India publicity material is carried out by H. M. G.’s representatives there and that it has not so far been possible for the Government of India even to send a representative to the U.S.S.R. for the purpose of exploring other avenues of distribution. On the other h*Nd, the representatives of the Tass Agency in India are not only allowed to move all over the country with the greatest freedom, but are permitted to issue to the Indian press publicity material received by cable from the U. S. S. R. much of which strongly criticizes Britain and 6ther countries with whom India is in friendly relations. Recently, this material has, however, been less openly critical than previously. New Time has published several articles about India, all of them violently anti-British and none of them noticeably pro-Indian in character. 2. Persia With the withdrawal of the last Indian troops from Persia and the preoccupation of the Persian people with internal affairs and with the important part now being taken by Persian affairs in world politics, interest in India is somewhat difficult to stimulate. The disturbed situa* ti^has considerably diminished sales of our publica tions all over the country and particularly in the North- •^/est. Reports have been received of sales agents being ' taken to task by the Soviet authorities for purveying pub licity material distributed through British Channels. It is hoped that since Indian material is no longer distributed in this way, it has not come under the ban. On the other hand, distribution through a Persian sales agency has by no means turned out to be plain sailing. A number of considerations, including the withdrawal of Indian forces from Persia, the need for post-war retrenchment and the present political situation have necessitated the examination of our present Persian out put with a possible view to its reduction. In normal times, everything produced at present could be justified by its reception among the various classes for which it is intended, but the popularity of publicity material is not necessarily a guide to its ultimate value. 3. Persian Gulf:— Various factors have contributed to an increase in the popularity of Al Arab in this region. Conducted as it is by a professional Egyptian journalist whose 17 years’ residence in India has made him a genuine admirer of Indian culture and administration, Al Arab is not generally recognised as being of official origin and its value is thereby enhanced. The difficulty of interesting Arabs in a magazine entirely devoid of controversial matters can hardly be overestimated. 4. Iraq:— There is no change in the situation except that, contrary to expectations, orders for publications have increased slightly during the period under review. 5. Afghanistan:— There has been some increase in the subscriptions to Taj Mahal both from Afghanistan itself and, more parti cularly, from Afghans in India. 6. North West frontier Province:— There is no change in the present situation. 7. U. S. A.:— Long delays have taken place in the arrival of Perspective in America and in its distribution there in spite of the fact that advance copies and bulk supplies of the earlier issues have now been in the U. S. A. for some months. It is unsatisfactory that no comprehensive reactions are as yet forthcoming to this novel venture. 3. China A suggestion that India should be replaced by a Chinese version of Dunya was firmly rejected by the Indian Agency General in Chungking. It appears that India has established a definite position for itself in Chungking, but it is not clear whether it would be as popular in the less restricted atmosphere of the larger cities of China which are now being opened up to the outside world. There is good reason to suppose that the appearance of a Chinese edition of Dunya in such cities as Shanghai, Hong Kong and Nanking would meet with a very rapid response. 9. far East:— Difficulties of communication both between India and the Far East and within the countries of the Far East themselves make the distribution of our material there difficult and even its introduction a slow business. Com prehensive and encouraging reports have, however, been recently received from Burma, Malaya and China. 10. British (ommonuiealth (exckidinq India) :— There is much room for the development of Indian publicity both in the United Kingdom and in theDominions. Detailed proposals for the distribution of United Publications in England through the medium of India House were submitted last November. The Office of the Indian High Commissioner, which had not previously been informed of their existence, was much impressed with United Publications and was very optimistic about their reception in England. It is hoped that a decision to meet his requests for supplies will very shortly be taken. The notice taken of the publica tions by the Imperial Institute also deserves considera- deration. The greatly increased interest in India now being taken in England and all over the British Com monwealth has presumably created a demand for material about India which it seems a pity not to satisfy. It is hoped that the existence of Indian Publicity Officers in various parts of the Dominions will quickly result in a demand for United Publications from those countries. 11. India:— A cut motion introduced in the Legislative Assembly by the Opposition on the 11th March 1946 resulted in the reduction of the Government of India’s expendi ture on publicity to the extent of about £ 650,000 per annum and the consequent abolition of four separate pub licity organizations within the Department of Information and Broadcasting. It is rumoured that the intention was to include the Publications Division in this cut, but the fact remains that it was not so included and is to con tinue work. Meanwhile, while applauding the action of the Assembly, certain newspapers have strongly criti cized the work of the Publications Division and have recommended its abolition. There is much ground for believing that the criticism of the Government of India publicity activities is actuated more by psychological causes than by any genuine disapprobation. It can only be supposed that those who describe United Publications as anti-Indian and anti-national have never taken the trouble even to peruse them. No careful reader of United Publications could by any stretch of imagina tion discover any anti-Indian or anti-national atmosphere about them. These attacks have been particularly pain ful for the large number of patriotic Indians employed in the Publications Division who have always been stimu lated by the genuine conviction that they were working in the best interests of India. Tnere are, however, grounds for hoping that since by its deliberate or uninten tional exclusion from the cut motion, the Publications Division has, as it were, received a mandate for the continuance of its work, it may by tactful persistence eventually succeed in impressing Indian politicians and pressmen with its utility. In spite of criticism^ the sales of United Publications in India continue to be satisfactory. B. P&amp;ODIKTION. The cloud of uncertainty which has shrouded the work ot the Division during the past few months has made it difficult to go ahead with any plan for the im provement of production by the purchase of additional printing equipment, the acquisition of better premises, etc. The use of the photo litho offset plan referred to in the last Report has resulted in some admirable work the like of which has not been produced by India before. The printing of the United Publications calendar in seven colours and the entire printing of Naunihal and Heyday by offset mark an epoch in the history of Indian printing. The covers of most of United Publications have been printed by the same process and it is little short of a tragedy that the prospects of these facilities remaining open to us are at present by no me^xs bright. With the new though possibly short lease of life granted to the Publications Division, it will be neces sary to resume our efforts to acquire printing machinery^- 1. DUSSIAN No change. 2. IRANIAN PERSIAN:- The January issue of Ahang in its new form appeared in February. In the present disturbed condition of Persia, reactions to a magazine of this kind can hardly be expected. 3. AEGHAN PERSIAN:— Taj Mahal is the only popular magazine of its kind ever produced in Afghanistan in the Afghan idiom of Persian. It is probable that no magazine so appreciated by its readers has in fact been read by so few people.^ ts continuance is regarded as fruitless by some, but it is n f difficult to visualize circumstances in which our persf*^ tence in producing it might be richly rewarded! Afghanistan has become much more India-conscious during the recent war and if only she were not haunted by the ever present spectre of Russia, it is probable that she would be glad to encourage the distribution of Taj Mahal. 4. PUSHTU:— No change. 5- ARABIC;- There has been a considerable increase in the print order of Al Arab. Agents approached by the Director during his tour in the Middle East last year showed great interest in Al Arab and placed encouraging orders for it. Although conditions in Egypt and Palestine have not recently been conducive to good sales, there is reason to believe that the circulation of Al Arab might still be con siderably increased.3 6. UfeDU:— (a) Ajkdl. There has been a marked increase in the print order of Ajkal and a determined sales drive would probably be able to put the circulation up by nearly 50 per cent. It is a curious fact that, while Indian politicians and pressmen have whole-heartedly condemn ed our external publications, none of which they seem to have read, Ajkal, which is now the best known and most popular fortnightly in India, has with one or two minor exceptions, received nothing but praise. Even other magazines, which might be expected to regard Ajkal as a hated rival, have limited their disapproval of it to the lifting of its articles without acknowledgement. (b) Ndlinihdl. Our justifiable pride in the printing of the last two issues of Naunihal has been slightly damped by the fact that newsagents, at any rate, appear t^ prefer other very poorly produced children’s magazines merely on the grounds that they have more pages. This ^ does not mean that they contain more matter since the ) ^alligraphy is much larger than that used in Naunihal jnd, by reason of the poor quality of paper used, much less clear. It is however important to note that Indian children do appear to prefer line drawings of a very crude kind to the admirable and artistically produced offset halftones of Naunihal. An interesting problem poses itself here: are we to cater for undeveloped tastes which are the result of lack of enterprise in printing and educa tion in India, or are we to try and raise the standard of printing by giving even children the best printing that money can buy ? 7. HINDI:- The progress made by the Hindi edition of Ajkal &lt;i&gt;-«yng the period under review is most 'encouraging. A *arge number of contributions is now being received •*^rom well-known writers in spite of the comparatively nigher rate of remuneration offered by other magazines. Hindi Ajkal is the best printed Hindi magazine in India and writers must derive some pleasure from seeing their work appear in such an attractive setting. 8. tNGUSH (a) Foreign Review has had a very good reception and has been accorded a highly laudatory notice in the Hindu, probably the most solid and respectable Indian- owned daily in India. Individual comments included a well-bred but not wholly flattering surprise that the Government of India is capable of producing a magazine at once so well-printed and so interesting. (b) Heyday. Like its Urdu edition, Heyday is now printed throughout by photo litho offset and may be regarded as a superior printing job. Large numbers are on order abroad. (c) Perspective. Owing to long delays in delivery, it has been necessary to change the printers of Perspective. This magazine has met with considerable praise from leaders of the Opposition in the Assembly. Contribu tions are now coming in more regularly and the flow may be expected to increase as the magazine becomes better known. A friendly Indian Muslim daily recently infor med us that a letter had been received criticizing Perspective on the score that it contained so little of Muslim interest or origin. There is no doubt that this criticism is a fair one; we have experienced great difficul ty in obtaining suitable articles from Muslim hands. Even a special visit by the Associate Editor to Aligarh University failed to produce any result. An attempt is now being made to obtain sanction for the employment of an additional Muslim Associate Editor. Even if it does not result in producing more Muslim material, the effect of a Muslim name as Associate Editor will probably be good. There have been several satisfactory press notices. (d) Onward. Criticisms of Onward have disclosed some confusion of aim on our part. On the one hand, we have set ourselves the task of appealing to the middle- class woman while, on the other hand, we have included certain items far above the head of the ordinary literate housewife. A meeting of representative Indian women decided, however, that while we should unquestionably take as our target domesticated rather than fashionable womanhood, there is nothing much wrong with Onward except that it needs some simplification. Indian language versions were strongly advocated, but printing difficulties will prevent their being undertaken at present. (e) India. The Chinese content of India has been considerably increased. (/) The following subjects were dealt with in the Mizan Newsletter during the period under review:— January 1946 — Problems of Post-war Currency and Exchange. February „ The Indian Electoral System. March „ The Indian Film Industry. (g) Indian Studies. The bound volume of Indian Studies is now out, but it is too early for any reactions to have been received. 9. SHAIPUR &amp; AL NAFIR:— The inclusion of the coloured insets mentioned in the last report has begun. 10. DUNYA:- The first issue of the Burmese edition of Dunya has been produced and reactions from Burma are awaited. Post-war retrenchment has resulted in the free issue of Dunya to Indian troops in India being stopped. Al though this means a reduction of some 75,000 copies in the print order, it is not unwelcome since such a large free issue naturally interfered seriously with sales. In agreat number lof cases, agents refused to take copies of a magazine which was being distributed free to large numbers of potential customers. Some 25,000 copies in various editions are still being sent to Indian troops abroad. Another respect in which the reduction in the supply of Dunya to the armed forces is satisfactory is that we are now no longer obliged to include six pages of material dealing with military matters. While this subject must always be well represented, too much insistence upon it is inclined to lower the appeal of the magazine among civilian readers. Dunya has great possibilities as a multi-lingual magazine since the addition of new language editions presents little difficulty. Our experiments in the overprinting of editions of Dunya whose size did not justify the etching of entire cylinders has proved successful. The process is laborious, but it does enable us to order bulk quantities of blanks (i. e. picture layouts without type matter) and allot them to new editions which are being tried out as an experiment. We now have under consideration Chinese, Malay, Arabic and Tibetan editions of Dunya. The first three of these have consi derable possibilities and if the print orders can be pushed above 10,000 it will pay us to print throughout by rotogravure. The Tibetan edition, on the other hand, is hardly expected to rise above 1,000. Dunya may lend itself to many interesting experiments in publicity. One of the many difficulties attending the distribution of publicity material in Afghanistan is the Afghan Government’s policy of making Pushtu the na tional language in spite of the fact that Persian as a literary medium is traditionally preferred. This means that while they do not wish to increase the volume of Persian literature in circulation, Pushtu literature must remain largely unread. It is thought that a Pushtu-Afghan Persian edition of Dunya would both please the Afghan Government as being an aid to the study of Pushtu by Persian-speaking elements, and also appeal to the majority of literates whose language is Persian. Another interesting experiment would be an English- Afrikaans edition. This might prove an exceedingly useful item in the Union of South Africa where an unsatisfactory situation prevails with regard to the large Indian community there. The magazine would provide the South African people with much sorely needed information about Indian progress, while the Indian community, almost all of whom know either English or Afrikaans, would be gratified to read a magazine largely concerned with their own country which was also available to the South Africans. C THE EUTU&amp;E OP FO&amp;EKN PUBLICITY. Although its internal activities have greatly increased during 1946, the main preoccupation of the Publications Division must still be regarded as foreign publicity. Not only are two thirds of its productions actually distributed abroad, but even those distributed in India are what might be described as “reverse foreign publicity”, namely, the instruction of the Indian public on foreign affairs. The attitude of Indian politicians and pressmen to foreign publicity, though apparently unreasoned and highly regrettable, can be traced to deep-seated psycholo gical causes the removal of which will take some time. It is unlikely that an Indian National Government woulpl fail to appreciate the value of publicity either abroad ^r in India, nor is there any reason to suppose that the actual nature of the publicity which they conducted would differ noticeably from our present productions^ It is not unnatural that in their present mocd th nationalist opposition to the existing Government place a higher value on negative, denunciatory and even vitu perative publicity than on the positive projection of India. They believe that any suggestion that India is already progressing redounds to the credit of the present Govern ment which they are anxious to discredit in every possible way both inside and outside India. In these unfortunate but unavoidable circumstances, our main object should probably be to keep in existence the organization which we have built up with so much care in order that it may prove a useful legacy to the Indian National Govern ment when it comes into being. While we can hardly expect to obtain the unquaL^I approval of Indian nationalists for our present activities^ it is possible that much more could be done to convince them that these activities, even in the interim period, are beneficial to India, are in no sense anti-Indian, that they by no means project the Government as the sole author of Indian progress and that they continue to draw attention to the inherent skill, culture and industry of the Indian people. Publicizing publicity is an art in itself and one which we have perhaps neglected. Since »ve have been more fortunate than other publicity organizations in being allowed to continue our activities, we should do our best to see that those activities are better understood in future.

GENERAL SITUATION A survey of the work at present undertaken by Publica tions Division is encouraging, both because our total circulation of magazines in various languages ranges between three and four lakhs and also because, with internal reorganisation, we have been able to adapt ourselves with economy and elasticity to peacetime conditions and needs. The distribution of magazines both at home and abroad continues to present difficulties, though this problem has been largely solved in India. As more foreign countries return to normal and more Indian Publicity Officers are appointed to supervise our interests there, this difficulty should in course of time solve itself. 1. U.S.S. There was no improvement in the situation regard ing the distribution of Indian publicity material in the U. S. S. R. Briefly, the present position is that having decided to discontinue the Indian Chronicle, we are concentrating on the Russian edition of Dunya. But no satisfactory arrangements can yet be reported in the distribution of this journal in the U. S. S. R. As part of the collation and research work, the Russian Section will shortly issue their first bulletin on the Russian Central Asian Republics. This publication is intended for official use only, and, if it proves useful, it may later be published monthly. 2. PERSIA:- Here again the distribution problem is one of the biggest we shall have to tackle. Distribution through a commercial firm under the supervision of the Indian Publicity Officer in Tehran has broken down; the Publicity Officer himself probably has his hands full with other work and it has begun to look as though we shall soon have to make our own arrangements after the matter has been gone into thoroughly and on the spot by some responsible representative of this Division. The disturbed situa tion in Persia can only be a partial explanation of this state of affairs. At present we have had to fall back on the help of the Information Department, British Embassy, Tehran, for pushing our sales, but this can only be a temporary measure. 3. PERSIAN GUIE:— No change. 4. SAUDI ARABIA:- There has been a noticeable increase in the sales of Al Nafir and Al Arab. 5. MAURITIUS:— Contact has been established with a commercial firm for conducting sales of our publications in English, Urdu and Hindi. 6. IRAQ:— No change. 7. AEGUANISTAN:- On the advice of the ‘men on the spot* we have, for the present, dropped the cultural monthly peric^ cal in Afghan-Persian— Taj Mahal —directed towards Afghanistan. We hope that it may be possible to^ revive this form of publicity at a favourable moment- Meanwhile, we are not relaxing our efforts to get into Afghanistan such of our magazines in Persian and Pushtu as are suitable. 3. NORTH WEST PRONTIER PROVINCE:- No change. 9. USA.:- “Perspective”. This publication, originally directed towards America, is finding the going heavy. We want this magazine to be pushed with much greater energy. In the first instance, the Public Relations Officer to the Indian Agency General, Washington, could help us with a complete distribution list. We could then supplement this by getting press age^s interested on a regular business footing. The h.^t reactions to the magazine are encouraging and, accord ing to the Public Relations Officer, public interest is growing in the magazine. With this initial advant age in our favour, we should do very much better than we seem to have done at present. 10. CHINA:- The decision to substitute a quarterly New India in English-Chinese for the old monthly India, has been implemented, and the first issue (October) is under print. Arrangements are in hand to bring out a Chinese-English version of Dunya. At present the Indian Publicity Officer is handling our distribution. 11. PAR EAST:- There is a demand for our publications both from Burma and Malaya, but at the moment shipping difficulties are a great handicap to timely distribution of our material there.2 12. BRITISH COMMONWEALTH:- The position with regard to distribution of our mater’Sil in the U.K. remains unchanged. Nor is there any special progress to report from Canada or Australia, though, of these two countries, the latter appears a little more alive and receptive to Indian matters. A review of our Journal Perspective in an Australian literary periodical, “Current Problems Digest”, says: “Perspective forms a welcome and valuable edition of what might be called national magazines, especially as it presents in dignified and telling form, without indulging in open propaganda, a case for India. The majority of people in this country are strikingly ignorant of the ways of thought apd, We of their neighbour across the Indian Ocean, a. u if Perspective can only be placed in the hands of sufficiently intelligent people, untold good would be ^lone It is sincerely to be hoped that Perspective will play an important part in building up a better understanding of Indian problems and ideals, and strengthen the bonds between what may well be sister Dominions.” An illustrated popular quarterly to be called India, intended for the United Kingdom, the Dominions and U.S.A. will be issued shortly. 13. INDIA:- Public and Press preoccupation with the epoch- making political changes that have taken place in India, has not left much time or space for any special comments to be offered in print about our publications. However, a number of important personalities, con- ta^^d in the normal course, have verbally expressed r great appreciation of the value and usefulness of the work done by the Division. B. P&amp;ODUGION: — Efforts are being made to strengthen the office printing press and we have purchased certain machinery from the Directorate General of Disposals. For lack of space in 4;he premises at present occupied by the Production Section, we have not been able to erect this machinery. A Process Plant which has been purchased is, for the same reason, awaiting installation. The lack of suitable accommodation for the Production Section is a real problem, and until a proper allotment is made the Production Section will continue to be seriously handicapped. 1. RUSSIAN:— No change. 2. IRANIAN PERSIAN :- The English-Persian edition of Dunya was stopped as the two other journals —Shaipur and Ahang —are more favoured by readers in Iran and as a measure of economy. 3. PUSHTU :- No change. 4. ARABIC:- No chage. . 5. URDU:- (a) Ajkdl : Ajkal continues to enjoy a large measure of popularity. We have not been able to do what we would have wished: to improve its “get-up” and printing, but the rapid sales of this journal and the enquiries and appreciations we continue to get are sure signs of healthy growth. Another encourag ing factor is the requests received from commercially produced magazines for permission to reproduce articles appearing in Ajkal. (a) Naunihdl: Although we have not been able to go back to the high standard of the April issue printed by Photo Litho offset in five colours, every effort is being made, with the resources at our disposal, to give our young readers a neat and attractive magazine. In the last two issues we have successfully experimented with colour tints on line blocks. 0. HINDI:- Ajkal is gaining in popularity. A number of eminent Hindi writers have agreed to write for the magazine. A new feature Achchi Hindi on the lines of Good English has been introduced into the magazine, which has been very much appreciated. 7. ENGLISH:- (а) foreign Review, a new Editor has been appointed who works under the direction of the Head of the Western Section, which post has now been filled. (б) Heyday. This magazine is very much in the same position as Naunihal. (c) Perspective. No change. (d) Onward. In September Onward completed its first year. Its October issue will have a number of special articles and features and will carry more reading matter. (d) Indian Studies. Very well received by the Press, this publication continues to attract notice both in India and abroad. (/) Planning and Development Pamphlets: The position in the matter of preparation and production of pamphlets on development plans of the Government of India has been clarified by the Development Board at its meeting held on 27th July 1946. This should prove helpful toour Pamphlet Section and provide opportunities for increased and smooth work. Pamphlets on the follow ing subjects are at present in preparation: (1) Cotton Textiles, (2) Roads, (3) Sugar, Alcohol and Food Yeast, (4) U. N. E. S. C. O., (5) Demobilisation and Resettle ment, and (6) Our Merchant Seamen. Among those which are planned are: (1) Power (including Coal), (2) Irrigation and Multi-purpose Waterways Develop ment, (3) Agriculture, (4) Forestry, (5) Fisheries, (6) Co-operation, (7) Minerals, (3) Housing and Town Planning and (3) Trade and Commerce. (&lt; 7 ) Shdipur and Al Nafif: These popular illustrated magazines, which appear in Persian and Arabic re spectively and explain the latest developments in India to the Middle East, have now been converted from monthlies into bi-monthlies (i. e. once in two months). (h) Al Arab: This journal may be said to have the distinction cf going to every potentate or eminent person in Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Orders recently received include those from Qutter, Persian Gulf, the Chief of the Arabs in Malindi, Kenya, the President of the Arab Union, October 1, 1946- Ciiro, three Arab Chiefs from Muscat, the brother of His Majesty King Ibn Saud and the late Minister of Wakfs, Cairo. (») Dunya: . The English-Persian and English- Hindi editions of Dunya have been dropped. In addition to the existing editions of Dunya y it has now been decided to publish the following new editions:— Gajerati—Hindi. Tamil—English. Chinese—English. Malay—English. Burmese—English. A'rikae n£—English. Tibetan—English. ^ (. PHDTOGBAPHS — The photographic library has been augmented by about 400 pictures as the result of a tour of South'^ India by an official photographer of this Division. We continue to feel very acutely the need of Middle East features. S. M. WASI. (Mr. W. L. Clough, who officiated as Director after Col.

P.—InO—1 — Printed by The United Press# Delhi.CIRCULAR No. 7 Secret Information and Publicity Work in Foreign Countries Sir, You will be aware from my circular despatch No. 17 of 15th ~March, 1946, that the Foreign Office on 1st April, became respon sible for the information and publicity work in foreign countries which was formerly the concern of the Ministry of Information. I now wish to make clear my intentions about the future performance of this work as part of the functions of the Foreign Service. 2. The dissemination abroad of information concerning this country to the public of other countries, and publicity designed to ensure a successful outcome for the actions and policies of His Majesty’s Government, are activities which must in my opinion continue, and cannot be regarded as a temporary phenomenon arising out of war-time needs. Our objectives in peace-time will naturally differ from those which we pursued during the war, and they will develop and change. One of the important objectives of our publicity for the next few years will be the promotion of British exports, and the explanation of British trading policy. 3. Because publicity and the giving of information is a task of permanent importance, and because it must be linked closely with other forms of action in support of our policy, it has been, and is my view that it must be performed as an integral part of the work of the Foreign Service. It was for this reason that I welcomed the transfer of the foreign responsibilities of the Ministry of Information to the Foreign Office. It is my wish that all nembers of the Foreign Service should regard relations with +he _ public, wherever they are stationed, as a matter of primary impor tance. This view was already accepted in the White Paper on the reform of the Foreign Service, and experience has justified its acceptance. 4. Appropriate provision is being made in the long term Foreign Service establishment for the inclusion of these functions in the duties of the Foreign Service, and recruitment of new entrants is taking place on the requisite scale. 5. At most of His Majesty’s Missions and at many of His Majesty’s Consulates it will be necessary to maintain information officers with small or large staffs, as may be appropriate, to engage His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers [ P 1083/1/907 ] H- ! Foreign Office,, 1 \ if \5th January 13786—1 32941—162 full time in information work. It is my intention that in the long ' run these staffs, so far as they are London based, shall be members of the appropriate branches of the Foreign Service, recruited in the usual way, and freely transferable not only between London and posts abroad, but also from one type of work to another within the Service. But probably for some years to come we shall have to continue, in information work as in some other aspects of Foreign Service duties, to avail ourselves of the experience of unestablished officers, some of whom may be employed on a form of contract. 6. It will also continue to be necessary in a few places {e.g., New York, Cairo, and possibly Singapore) to maintain Information Offices which, though part of the Foreign Service establishment, are separate from the Mission or Consulate, because they have_^ reponsibilities covering a larger area than a Consular District or even than a single country. 7. It is nevertheless my intention that the full responsibility for publicity and information work shall fall on the Head of the Mission or the Consular Officer in charge of the post, and when special staff is provided for information work it will be provided in order to enable the Head of Mission or the Superintending Con sular Officer to carry out those responsibilities. 8. Not only should all Heads of Missions and all Superin tending Consular Officers concern themselves with good public relations, but they should impress on all members of their staffs, no matter what their specialist duties, that they too have a general responsibility in this respect. It is already understood that all have a representational capacity; all must equally be ready to co-operate in information and publicity addressed to a wider public, and make the best use of their personal and official contacts \ for this purpose. 9. Even where the publicity that is required is on matters which are within the special spheres of work of a particular individual member or section of a Mission or Consulate, the Information Officer or his staff should all the same be asked to undertake it, unless the contacts of the individual member or section are obviously adequate^ for the purpose in hand. For example, Commercial Diplomat’ and Consular Officers will ask their “ Information ” colleagues, r-s where such exist, to assist in securing publicity for the British ^ Industries Fair. 10. At those missions or posts where there is no officer speci fically charged with information and publicity work, the task must fall on officers who also perform other Foreign Service duties. In some posts this is already done. It may be necessary to provide additional clerical assistance at certain posts in order to enable them to carry out the duties which fall on them; and if experience shows that this is so, a case can be made and it will be considered. 11. In order that Consular posts may carry on these duties it is proposed that in future they shall receive instructions given in my name from the appropriate Information Departments of this■■■■ 3 Office, and such Foreign Office circulars as have in the past been addressed only to Information Officers will be sent also to Superin tending Consular Officers, whenever they contain information or instructions on which action by them is required. In future the “ Information- News Letters ” will also be sent to Superintending Consular Officers; copies of the first five of these are attached and are commended to their attention. 12. One of the most important media for the dissemination \ of the British point of view is the B.B.C., and it is important that all posts should be able to receive its transmissions. The Foreign Office has a small stock of good wireless receivers taken over from the Ministry of Information and Political Intelligence Department, jand they can be issued for use in missions and Consular posts hich do not already possess adequate receivers. Applications for receivers (and spare parts) should be addressed to the Estab lishment and Organization Department. They will be issued _&gt;to the post and not to individual officers, and should be entered in the inventory of official property. The cost of their main tenance may be charged in the Public Information Services Accounts. 13. It will be some time before the administration and financing of the Information Services which have been taken over from the Ministry of Information and (in the Far East) the Political Intelli gence Department, can be thoroughly integrated into the F'oreign Service system, and in a number of posts, until new instructions can be issued, it will be necessary to continue the special provisions for staffing and financing which now exist. This, however, should not impede the rapid incorporation of the Information Services into the general structure in other respects, and it is my wish that this should proceed as rapidly as is feasible. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN■■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■■■■ CONFIDENTIAL. n. o.u . i wir' x***- -* Foreign Office, , London, S.W. 1, 28f/i June, 1946. INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 1. Dear Information Officer, W e propose to write to you from time to time so that you may, as far as ^ possible, be kept in the picture about what is going on here; and this is the first of the series. The letters will be confidential, meant for your own use and that N of the mission of which you are a member, and we shall rely on you to keep them so. It is only on this understanding that we shall be able to write to you freely and informally as we want to and our letters will only be of real use to you if we can do so. You must use your own judgment as to the extent to which you show them to members of your own staffs, but for our part we shall assume that the distribution will be limited to those people who ordinarily have access to the confidential files of the Chancery. Since this is the first letter it may be as well to begin by inviting you to say what you most want from us, and what sorts of information such a letter as this may most usefully contain. We shall in any event try to give you an impression of the views held here in London about the work that our Information Services in foreign countries can most usefully do, and the policy we are pursuing. We shall try to tell you, too, about any changes and developments in the organisation of the Information Services at home and abroad, about important appointments and so forth. And if any Information Officer raises questions the answers to which may seem likely to be of general use, we may put the reply into one of these letters. So please write to us and tell us what you want; and, if anything we say in our letters sounds wrong to you, don’t hesitate to say so. The regional Information Departments of the Foreign Office (see next paragraph) will naturally contribute to the preparation of these letters, and will see them before they are issued. Organisation of Information Departments. You will by this time have seen not only Mr. Bevin’s Circular No. 048 of the 28th August last, but also his Circular No. 024 (No. 17 to Consulates) about the transfer of the foreign side of the Ministry of Information to the Foreign Office. To bring the story up to date you should know that the transfer took place on the 1st April, and that the process of integrating the Information Departments into the Foreign Office is well under way. It will, however, proceed more effectively when we are able to move all of them into Nos. 12-15 Carlton House Terrace, four Regency houses which look over the Mall towards the main Foreign Office building on the other side of the Horse Guards Parade. We hope this will be in August, oi' perhaps even earlier, but man-power shortage is the difficulty, and the Ministry of Works is only now beginning to get them ready for us. 13384 [32880—1]The old Soviet Relations Division of the Ministry of Information was merged into the European Information Department, which itself has now been divided into the West European and East European Information Departments. The dividing line runs from the Baltic to the Adriatic, leaving Czechoslovakia and Finland to the Eastern European Department. These, together with the Middle Eastern, Latin American and American Information Departments, are still housed at Montagu Mansions off Baker Street, as is the Establishment and Finance Department which looks after their affairs. These five Information Departments are under the general supervision of Mr. 0. A. Scott, as Supervising Counsellor. The Far Eastern Information Department is at Bush House in Aldwych and the Cultural Relations Department, which looks after the British Council and is also concerned with educational relations with other countries, cultural conventions and so forth, is at 3 Cleveland Row, at the foot of St. James’s Street opposite St. James’s Palace. So is the newly-formed Information Policy Department (referred to as the General Information Department in Circular No. 024) which writes you this letter. (Our functions are briefly: General as distinct from regional information policy, and preparation of general guidance. Representa tion of Foreign Office on Overseas Information Services (Official) Interdepart mental Committee. Co-ordination of demands on Central Office of Information. Allocation of resources between work in foreign territories, and reorganisation of that work. Organisation of trade and tourist publicity. Relations with the B.B.C. Demarcation of functions between Information Services and British Council and other bodies.) Mr. Kirkpatrick, who as Under-Secretary supervises all these Departments except Establishment and Finance, is also at 3 Cleveland Row. The Information Services in relation to the rest of the Foreign Service. It is Mr. Bevin’s objective to integrate the work of the Information Depart ments completely into that of the Foreign Office and Foreign Service. This means that Information Officers and Information Services abroad will work as part of the team under His Majesty’s Principal Representative, the Ambassador, Minister or the head of the Mission. The responsibility of the Information Officer will be through him to the Secretary of State. The responsibilities of the Informa tion Officer in respect of policy are now exactly parallel to those of his Diplomatic and other colleagues. That is to say that within his own sphere he is responsible for advising the head of the Mission on the probable effects of actions which may be proposed, and on the best ways of making British policy and action under stood in the country with which he is concerned, in addition to the execution of information work. (This does not mean, of course, that the Information Officer will not correspond directly and “ semi-officially ” with the Information or other Departments of the Office—see below—but it does mean that the Information Officer will consult the head of Mission on important decisions and be guided by him, and that formal communications will take the shape of despatches from the head of the Mission to the Secretary of State.) Other Departments of the Foreign Office. It will thus be important for you to know what the other Departments of the Foreign Office-dhe so-called “political” and “functional” or “subject”■■■■■ y 3 Departments—do. We recommend you for the moment to borrow for the purpose a copy of the monthly Foreign Office list; and we also propose shortly to send you a chart and description of the Foreign Office organisation. The method of working of the Foreign Office is that any Department of the Office may write to any Mission abroad about the matters with which it deals (and, of course, may draft despatches or telegrams from the Secretary of State to the Ambassador). For example, the Western Department rather than the North American Department will write to the Embassy in Washington about Spanish affairs, naturally consulting the North American Department beforehand as necessary. It has been the general practice of the Ministry of Information to correspond with posts mainly through the regional Division concerned, but we expect that the usual Foreign Office practice will be adopted in the long run. You should, therefore, bo aware of the functions of the various Departments. Already there have been some instances of guidance on Information matters being prepared for telegraphing to Missions by the Political Department most closely concerned. If you receive such communications you will know that the Political Departments are aware of the necessity to consult the relevant Information Departments and that the latter will know what is going on. Similarly, of course, the other Depart ments of Government (the Board of Trade, for example, or the Ministry of Food) are consulted on matters which concern them. But for the present you should continue to write to the regional Information Department which deals with the country in which you are stationed, when you want information, assistance or advice. They can always pass your enquiry to the appropriate Department to deal with. And when in doubt about whether to write to the Foreign Office Information Department concerned or the Central Office of Information, it will usually be better to prefer the former. On Establishment and Finance matters correspondence should, of course, be with that Department. Aims of Policy. It will be our responsibility to keep you informed of the various aims of the policy of His Majesty’s Government which you will be expected to support by information and publicity activities, but it may be useful for you to have one or two pointers at once. Trade Publicity. We shall have to work out carefully with the Board of Trade and the other Departments concerned, like the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the means by which information and publicity can be used in support of British trade policy and the promotion of British exports. But you should know now that the decision of His Majesty’s Government is that the Information Services abroad shall play an important part in this work. The Department of Overseas Trade has been absorbed into the Board of Trade as the Export Promotion Department, but the Commercial Diplomatic Service has come under the administration of the Foreign Office, just as have the Information Services. The effect of this is that all trade promotion activities in foreign countries are now the responsibility of Officers of the Foreign Office, though policy will be decided by the Board of Trade, naturally in consulta tion with the appropriate Foreign Office Department. It is the Cabinet s intention4 that th£ Information Services should work with their colleagues of the Com mercial Diplomatic and Consular Services, should put their publicity experience at their disposal, and should undertake such publicity work as needs to be done. It will, therefore, be an advantage if you will discuss with the appropriate officer at the Mission or Consulate with which you are connected the best means by which this may be made effective. This is, it will be understood, only a preliminaxy warning, and more specific and detailed instructions will have to take a more formal shape. Nevertheless, if there is any way in which Information Officers can give current help to their colleagues, they should do so. Tourist Traffic. The way in which tourist travel to this country is to be encouraged and provided for is still under discussion, but when the time comes there is no doubt that the Information Services will have an important part to play, and there is everything to be said for considering in advance what are the potentialities of ^ the country in which you work, and the methods which are most likely to bear fruit. It will not be possible to encourage a large flow of visitors to this country before 1947. Industrial Welfare. It is the wish of the Secretary of State that we should do what we can to promote the good repute of the form of social democracy which has grown up in this country, to show' its advantages, and to encourage other peoples to benefit bv our experience. One of the things in which he thinks we can take special pride is the extent to which Industrial Welfare has been developed in this country, and he wants the Information Services to take pains to see that it is understood. The Information Departments are working out with the Central Office of Informa tion a scheme by which this can be done, and the provision of suitable information materials. You will already have had a certain amount of publicity and reference material on this subject from the Ministry of Information, and you should see that it is given full use Make a point too of giving adequate prominence to such material on this subject as you may receive through the London Press Service, in feature articles and so on. No doubt it will require adaptation to local circum stances in many instances, but it should not be omitted from your output unless you can give very good reasons. In that case write to the regional Information Department with w'hich you correspond and say why. It would be a mistake to burden this first letter with too much comment or information, so here it ends. Yours ever, INFORMATION POLICY DEPARTMENT.Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1, July 1946. INFORMATION NEWS LETTER No. 2. J &gt; ''Nr Information Officer, This is less a second news letter than a supplement to the first. Early in August we hope that the Departments concerned with overseas information will be assembled under one roof in Carlton House Terrace. Therefore, it seems appropriate that this time we should send you a number of charts in order to give you an outline of: — 1. The organisation of the Information Departments. 2. The relation of the Information Departments to the Foreign Office as a whole. 3. The organisation of the C.O.I.

The Central Office of Information is a non-Ministerial department under the general surveillance of the Lord President of the Council, but answered for in Parliament by Treasury Ministers. 2. The main function of the C.O.I. is to maintain on behalf of Government Depart ments most of the common service duties previously carried out by the Ministry of Information. 3. The accompanying chart sets out clearly the different departments of the C.O.I. and their respective functions. 4. The C.O.I. is responsible for the technical execution of Departmental requirem^s and on questions of presentation should he regarded as the expert. Departments have .ie final right to reject material provided by the C.O.I. to which they raise substantial objection^ 5. It is important that Information Officers should not make requests for the service of the C.O.I. direct, hut that they should be made through the Foreign Office Information Department concerned. When a request from an Information Officer has been approved by his Information Department the latter will place the order with the C.O.I. Subsequently, in order to save time and avoid unnecessary duplication, the department of the C.O.I. concerned and the Information Officer may enter into direct correspondence, though copies should always be sent by the officer to his Information Department. 6. It is within the defined functions of the C.O.T. to provide technical advice on all publicity matters. z-i ^ -r i • -i. • Information Officers may enter into direct consultation with the C.O.I., but again it is desirable that copies of the correspondence should be sent to the Information Department concerned.5 CENTRAL OFFICE OF INFORMATION, 1.7.46 Films Mr. It.

H. b- m ' * INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 3* I i Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1, Dear Information Officer, 8th August, 1946. The closing section of our Information Newsletter No. 1 referred to the Secretary of State’s wish that British publicity overseas should pay increased attention to industrial welfare. It is now necessary to consider in greater detail the objective to be pursued and the methods to be used. As the first newsletter indicated, the presentation of industrial welfare should be treated as part of the process of promoting the good repute of our system of social democracy and encouraging other peoples to benefit by our experience. The Secretary of State wishes industrial welfare publicity to be accompanied and reinforced by publicity for the social legislation of the present Government. His aim is to show clearly what is being done for the worker; and this can only be achieved if we paint a composite picture depicting what is being done for the worker in the way of industrial welfare at his place of work and what is being done for him in his home life in the way of measures such as the Education, Health and Social Security Acts. There are two main aspects of industrial welfare to be considered. First, the contribution of the Government in terms of legislation and regulations for the control of health and safety conditions, and the provision of social services. Second, the contribution of private organisations, including both the activities of voluntary societies and the provision made for the welfare of workers by private firms. It is important that both these aspects of industrial welfare should receive attention, because the success with which State and voluntary activity complement one another is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the British system. The Central Office of Information has prepared a reference paper on industrial welfare, copies of which should be reaching you shortly. You will find in it a great deal of background information which you should put to use through the most appropriate channels. You will already have received a similar reference document on social services (R.697—Development of British Social Services), which should be drawn on for the purposes indicated above. There is also annexed to this letter a memorandum showing the kind of publicity materials which are available. Some of these will have reached you already. Others are in preparation and will be available for your use. They will be supplied to you either automatically or on request; this is a matter for correspondence between yourself and the appropriate regional information department of the Foreign Office. In order that the most effective use may be made of the informative and publicity materials available to you, it will be necessary to consider what are the audiences which it is most important to reach, and what are the most effective channels of distribution. It is clear that if information about British industrialwelfare is issued to all and sundry without selection of the most suitable recipients it is likely to achieve little effect. It is equally clear that publicity materials produced in future should be prepared with the right audiences in mind. These will vary from country to country. In seme the trade unions and workers’ organisations will form both the main target and the main channel of dissemina tion. In others it may be that the most important task is to see that Government departments are fully informed. It will be for the information officer in each country to consider what may most usefully be done, whether any specially prepared materials of publicity are required, and, if so, what they should be. You should therefore report so soon as may be on these subjects to the regional information department of the Foreign Office which deals with your part of the world. In making your report you should keep the following general principles in mind: — (а) It is clearly not possible in most countries to give the general mass of the population any detailed information about British industrial welfare. Only the most elementary notion of the good conditions which prevail in this country can be got across. The purpose here should be not to create the impression that we are concerned only with the welfare of our own people, but rather that our system of social democracy produces individual welfare and is worth copying, and that it contributes to stability and peace. (б) More detailed information about British methods will only be suitable for more specialised groups. Here the objective is to give the (c) In those countries where Labour, Agricultural or Health Attaches are appointed to His Majesty’s Missions their collaboration should be sought. (d) It is important to avoid the appearance of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries; and in some countries this is of extreme importance. Tact in the presentation of British methods is therefore most necessary. (e) There are likely to be criticisms of British failures in respect of industrial welfare in many countries, arising either out of misrepresentations for political purposes, or out of existing conditions in British-owned enterprises abroad or, e.g., on British ships. If any such criticisms become serious they should be reported. Your general observations on the whole question of presentation of British industrial welfare in the country with which you are concerned will be welcome, Yours ever, Information Policy Department. i;3 ANNEX. Central Office of Information. PUBLICITY MATERIAL ON INDUSTRIAL WELFARE. The following is a summary of the material dealing with industrial welfare which has been produced by the Central Office of Information. General points to be noted are: — (a) Special prominence was not given to this subject during the war because at that time it was necessary to lay emphasis on the sacrifices made by the civilian population in the interest of the war effort rather than on the good conditions enjoyed by British workers. (b) Many points connected with industrial welfare have nevertheless been covered incidentally in material dealing with general industrial conditions, education, health, &amp;c. A.—Printed Material. (1) Feature Articles Service. Forty-two articles and one picture feature have been produced during the present year on such subjects as workers’ welfare schemes, workers’ health and safety, wages councils, works councils, apprenticeship and training, co-operative holidays for workers, welfare of miners and dockers, &amp;c. Other articles will be prepared whenever suitable news stories are available. Two regular labour cables (Tracey and Schaffer) are sent out weekly, these regularly cover various aspects of industrial welfare. (2) London Press Service. This is not a particularly easy medium to use, as it deals primarily with news The Schaffer and Tracey articles (see above) are sent out weekly; in addition, the L.P.S. General Programme (daily) and the Political Programme occasionally touch on the subject. . L.P.S. General Programme has also included material of this kind, obtained from Reference Division, the Ministry of Labour and employers. L.P.S. Political Programme is keeping a watch for suitable material in Parliament. Regional Services associated with L.P.S. are also making a point ot including material. Suitable articles will be cabled when available. (3) Digest Service. Only a limited amount of material on the theme has so far appeared; this is mainly due to the absence of readable material appearing elsewhere which could be reprinted. . , A substantial feature on “ Democracy in the lactory, including industrial welfare, together with a bibliography of official and unofficial works on the subjects, will appear in the October issue of the International Digest in all versions except German. A major illustrated feature on factory life in Britain, including industrial welfare, will be published in Blick in die Welt (German illustrated magazine). [32880—3] f. 24 (4) Booklets, dc. Various aspects of the theme have been covered in the following pamphlets: — “ Britain’s Social Services To-day and To-morrow,” ” War Job,” “ Britain’s Industrial Achievements ” (all published in a number of languages), in “ Glimpses of Industrial Britain,” “ In Reply to Yours,” &amp;c. (5) Reference Service. The following reference papers have been produced: — R. 1088.—Industrial Health and Welfare in Great Britain (26th June, 1946) (replacing R. 714). R. 454.—Feeding of Industrial Workers (25th November, 1945). R. 436.—Industrial Health and Welfare (4th November, 1945). And the following short notes: — Workers’ Suggestion Schemes in British Industry (25th September, 1943). Recreation Schemes for Young Industrial Workers (27th March, 1944). Recreation and Health Schemes for Miners (31st March, 1944). Holiday Schemes and Camps for Industrial Workers (27th March, 1944). Aspects of industrial welfare are included in: — R. 616.—Post-War Reconstruction in Britain Handbook (28th Novem ber, 1944), with its supplements and revises. R. 782.—Home Front Handbook (April 1945). Weekly Post-War Reconstruction Survey. Weekly Home Affairs Survey. General and Technical Clip-Sheets. Other reference papers useful in providing the general social welfare background are: — R. 697.—The Development of British Social Services, supplemented by— R. 854.—Medical Services in Britain. R. 542.—National Insurance in Britain, with Supplement. R. 645.—Education in Britain. R. 262.—Adult Education in Britain. Reference Division has also filed material, selected books and pamphlets, a bibliography and contacts with authorities concerned, which enable particular enquiries to be dealt with. A shorter reference paper (supplementary to R. 1088) is being written, dealing with provision for industrial welfare by individual firms, with examples from actual factories. A new edition of the Home Front Handbook is being prepared: this will include sections on industrial and social welfare. B.— Visual Material. (1) Photographs and Film-strip Service. During these last two years the following material on Industrial Welfare has been sent overseas:— (a) Feature Sets (e.g., sets intended for publication in overseas newspapers and periodicals): — “ Industrial Welfare.”—Comprehensive set taken by British Council for the Ministry of Labour.* Factory Welfare/'—Set taken by Ministry of Information at Pilkington Cilass Factory with special emphasis on health and rehabilitation. “Factory Clinic.’’ “ Mersey Docks Medical Service.’’ “ Industrial Safety.’’ “ Production Committee.’’ “A Joint Production Committee Meets.’’ “ Day in the Life of a Shop Steward.’’ “ Working Mothers’ Nursery.’’ “ Eest House for Women Workers.’’ “ Ballet Goes to the Factory.” “ C.E.M.A. Concerts for Factories.” “ Workers’ Rehabilitation.” “ Dock Workers’ Rehabilitation Centre.” “ The Disabled Made Able.” “ Resettlement Advice Bureau.” “ Merchant Navy Hotel.” “ Merchant Seamen’s Union.” “ Cardiff’s Merchant Navy Club.” “ Rest House for Women’s Land Army.” “Rural Welfare Officer.” In addition a number of “ second rights ” features on similar subjects were bought for publication overseas.

The material produced by them will be made available in August and the following months in the form of— (i) A “ documentary ” feature set of about forty pictures illustrating most of the points covered by Reference Division paper. This will go out to all posts for possible publication in press and periodicals and for reference purposes. (ii) A picture set of twenty-five photographs with the general title “ Industrial Welfare in Britain ” available for ordering in September. This will be followed in the next three months by three or more picture sets of twelve photographs which will each deal in rather greater detail with one aspect of the subject, e.g., Workers’ Health, Industrial Safety, Factory Personnel Management, &amp;c.6 (iii) A film-strip of forty-fifty frames, on the industrial welfare in general, will be available for ordering in September. This will be followed by two or three further strips each dealing with one aspect of the subject. A strip on “ Rehabilitation ” js already in production. (iv) Pictures will be included wherever suitable in the Mat and Stereo Service. (v) The maximum number of “ second rights ” features bearing on the subject will be included in the overseas services. (2) Exhibitions Service. Material on industrial welfare was included in “ Britain Rebuilds ” for Poland, and in “ Britain Go£s Ahead ’’ for West Europe (excluding Spain and Portugal). The latter exhibition may also go to Germany and Austria. The subject has been dealt with in exhibitions sent to Greece and Malaya. Further material will be included in the Commonwealth exhibitions for Western Europe (including Spain and Portugal). (3) Films. The following films bearing on industrial welfare (not including films dealing mainly with production drives, which refer only in passing to welfare arrange ments) have been made since 1944 for non-theatrical distribution overseas: — Worker and War Front Magazine, No. 14.—Item: Accident Service in a South Wales Colliery.

August 1946.SECRET. * Foreign Office, t i ^ * London, S.W. 1, 17/7? October, 1946. INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 4. /■&gt; Dear Information Officer, The members of the Ministerial Committee on Overseas Information Services have decided that it would be useful to have a statement on paper, for the use of the Government Departments concerned with overseas territories, and for British Information Services abroad, of the principal facts about this country which they would wish to see emphasised. They have therefore caused the attached paper on the 'Projection of Britain' to be prepared; it has their approval, and they have instructed that it should be circulated. 2. It was agreed by the Committee that Departments should transmit the paper to their Information Officers overseas with explanations of its purpose and the way in which it should be used. This is therefore an appropriate occasion for an explana tion of the part which we think the “ Projection of Britain ” should play in our information work in foreign countries. 3. The principal reason for maintaining our information services abroad is to assist in ensuring the success of the policy of His Majesty’s Government. Publicity must thus be thought of first of all as a means of explaining the action and purposes of His Majesty’s Government, and thus preventing or diminishing the opposition to them which may arise out of misunderstanding and misrepresentations. 4. The objectives of His Majesty’s Government are not, however, limited to selfish ends, as paragraph 2 (b) of the enclosed paper shows. We have a great interest in the spread of British ideas and British standards, as is evidenced by Mr. Bevin’s constant insistence on the importance of improving living standards in the Middle East. 5. The first objective of our publicity in each country must be to deal where appropriate with those aspects of British policy and action which affect and are of primary interest to the people of that country. For this reason among others it cannot be assumed that the projection of Britain in itself should absorb all our efforts. The picture of Britain which we wish to see presented should rather be regarded as the background of our work; the stage setting, without which the plav would be unconvincing and incomplete. Different parts of the setting will be required for different scenes of the play. Industrial welfare, for example (see News letter No. 3), is of particular importance in connection with the oil situation in Persia, and the Foreign Office issued a press statement on the subject on the 6th August which you will have seen. 13384—3 [32880—4]6. It is recognised, too, that when we are presenting a picture of Britain we must envisage the kind of picture which will appear in the mind of the individual Persian or American, Peruvian or Siamese, rather than the completeness of the picture we can paint. Events and his local circumstances and surroundings will by and large determine the picture he forms. It would be impracticable to aim at a complete understanding. This therefore is another reason for selection; and the aim should be to leave in the mind of the individual such an impression as will lead him to approve some purpose or purposes of His Majesty’s Government, and which will also make him well disposed towards this country. The goodwill which derives from the development of mutual and improved understanding in matters of common importance is more likely to be permanent than is anything built on descriptions of this country unconnected with current events. 7. Publicity is only one of many means by which His Majesty’s Government pursues its policies in other countries. These means range from military or naval measures and diplomatic representation and various forms of international negotia tion and participation in international bodies to ownership and development of economic resources and assistance to individual traders. Publicity has a part to play in support of many activities, and if it is to be effective it must be closely connected with them. 8. The purpose of publicity must normally be to stimulate action of one sort or another. There are two main kinds of such action with which we are concerned. The first is the sort of action which arises when a favourable foreign public opinion is led to support some development which is of interest to His Majesty’s Government. An important example at present is the development of governmental action in all countries designed to make the best use of food supplies. The second is action by individuals which is itself of value, such as the purchase of British goods, or individual saving of food. It seems probable that the second form of action will take an increasingly important part among the objectives of our publicity in the future, and this will involve selection among the aspects of British life which are to be presented to foreigners, for example, in encouraging the tourist trade. 9. When embarking on publicity activity it is therefore necessary to have clearly in mind the purpose to be achieved, and the methods for achieving it. It is also necessary to know what media of publicity are most suited to the job in hand {e.g., exhibitions are, in general, more effective in stimulating individual action of a desirable kind than in so affecting public opinion as to bring about Government action) and it is essential to make as sure as possible that the resources available and the publicity machinery are adequate to do the job. 10. Certain media of publicity which take a long time to prepare, and therefore have their effect long after production work is initiated, are suitable only for the pursuit of long-term objectives : among them are films, exhibitions and books. 11. It is essential to avoid dispersal of our publicity resources over too wide a range of general topics. If we are to make an impact and, in Mr. Bevin’s phrase, to get value for money spent, we must concentrate most of our attention on a small number of facets of British life. This is particularly true of publicity through long term media.3 12. It is in the light of all these considerations that we should consider which aspects of the picture of Britain are of greatest importance at the present moment in most countries of the world. They must be features which support major objectives of His Majesty’s Government. They must have a general appeal to the majority of the people in foreign countries, as touching their interests, and they must lend themselves to publicity treatment through the principal media. 13. Two main points emerge, and they are closely linked. They are :— (a) This country is the leading exponent of social democracy in government. (b) This country leads in concern for the liberty and welfare of the individual through social services and industrial conditions. 14. The current projection of these facets of our life should be done with the ^ following considerations in mind :— (a) We want to see the benefits of social democracy and individual liberty and v welfare spread throughout the world. (b) We are no longer a great creditor country, and until our efforts at trade expansion have produced their effect our balance of payments situation will remain very difficult. (c) Our huge responsibilities for security and freedom in other parts of the world at present limit the contributions we can make to world welfare, and especially the goods we can deliver. (d) In dealing with freedom from want, the food shortage must come first. 15. To sum up, we should use the attached paper as the authoritative basis for the kind of picture of this country which we want to put across. It shows what we want others to think of us, and we should not, in our publicity, describe this country in terms which are contrary to its intentions. But we should primarily direct our effort at improving the understanding and acceptability of current policy and action, and the picture of this country which we present should be used as the background to current events. Yours ever, Information Policy Department.Confidential. INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 5. Dear Information Officer, London, S.W. 1, 15th November, 1946. We have received many replies from Information Officers indicating that these Newsletters are useful. We shall continue to welcome suggestions and criticisms. Replies should be 'ddressed to Information Policy Department but as they often contain questions which are more properly answered by the Regional Information Departments ^ concerned it would be much appreciated if Information Officers would supply an extra copy of their reply. Separate questions might well be dealt with in separate letters. It is not yet possible to issue the Newsletters at regular intervals (there was a considerable gap between Nos. 8 and 4) but it is our general intention to send them approximately monthly. The last two have been devoted to single, major themes, “ Industrial Welfare ” and “ The Projection of Britain.” This issue is a mixed bag covering a number of points and we have also included a list of Information Officers. Government Planning. Information Officers will have received by L.P.S. and by bag the text of the Lord President’s address to the Institute of Public Administration on ” Planning.” As Mr. Herbert Morrison said : ‘ ‘ Britain is the first great nation to attempt to combine large-scale economic and social planning with a full measure of individual rights and liberty.” We are still in the experimental stage but the speech is a prelude to the issue, probably in the latter part of February, of the Government’s irst White Paper on Economic Planning. We hope to be able to keep you informed about the development of the machinery of Governmental planning in this country. Enquiries from Foreign Governments about the Re-organisation of British Overseas Information Services. In several recent instances Information Officers have been approached by officials of the Government in whose territory they are serving with requests for information regarding the reorganisation of our Information Services. These requests usually appear to be made because the Government in question is contemplating an organisation on similar lines to our own. 13384—4 [32880—5] b2 Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, and Information Officers will naturally wish to be as helpful to foreign Governments as possible. But while we do not wish to conceal general information about the nature of our organisation from legitimate enquirers, it is important not to give the impression that it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to build up a powerful publicity machine abroad. Rather it should be stressed that our object is to supply information in response to demand and not to try to force our point of view down the throats of other countries. Furthermore, while we should respond to legitimate demands for other Govern ments for such information, it is more useful to tell other clients what we can provide than how we do it, and invitations to publicise ourselves might be used to describe output rather than organisation. Indeed it is generally a good rule to reverse the old proverb about children, and to remember that “ A publicity officer should be heard and not seen.” We should certainly not court publicity. The charts and information contained in Newsletter No. 2, although they must of course be treated as confidential so far as showing them to anyone outside the /'N service is concerned, should be adequate to make it possible for Information Officers to give a general account of the reorganisation of the Information Services. If more than a general description of the organisation is required it will be best for you to refer the request back to this department. And it is important to remember that no information about our work should be published abroad, either by ourselves or by foreign Governments, if it is of such a character that the United Kingdom Parliament should have been informed first. This applies particularly to information about the expenditure of public funds. Liaison with Dominion Representatives. It is important that in all countries where the British Dominions are represented, Information Officers should maintain contact with the officer responsible for informa tion about that Dominion so that every opportunity can be taken of giving publicity to the Commonwealth aspect of our affairs. There is, within the C.O.I., an Empire Information Service Section which works in close consultation with the Dominions, Colonial and India Offices. The function ^ of this section is to initiate the production of publicity material on Empire subject, for distribution at home and overseas, and it is appropriate for Information Officers to include in their output information about commonwealth affairs as a whole, and about the Colonies, within the terms of the guidance given in Information News letter No. 4 and its enclosure (‘‘The Projection of Britain”). But since the Dominions are independent countries it is undesirable to engage in any large publicity activity about an individual Dominion without consultation with that Dominion, and this may most conveniently be done through this Office when the Dominion has no representative of its own in the country concerned. Enquiries which can be answered from reference books in your library should of course always be answered. An annotated bibliography on the Empire will shortly be circulated.3 Tourists in 1947. I lie Cabinet has decided that visas will be freely granted to foreign tourists who wish to visit this country in 1947. A beginning has been made with certain countries for the mutual abolition of visas. I his year, as Information Officers will be aware, no visas w'ere granted to tourists except from Europe because no transport was available. The serious shortage of hotel accommodation in this country, particularly in London, has made it difficult enough to find room for foreigners visiting this country for urgent political or business reasons. Even in 194/, both transport to this country and accommodation within it will still be a long way below the pre-war level. /- ' v i A 8 ^ ai ‘ a8 _ Europe is concerned the transport position is likely to be fairly good brom the l nited Slates and Canada the North Atlantic shipping services are not expected to be able to carry more than 40,000 tourists during the period May to September. It has not been found possible to estimate to what extent this figure will be supplemented by the air services. \ isitois horn Latin America may have to rely entirely upon the air services. It is unlikely that any shipping accommodation will be available for tourists as the I ships intended foi the Latin American services will not be converted to passenger use in time. Shipping services through the Mediterranean will have little room for tourists. As for hotel accommodation it is estimated that it should be }&gt;ossible to find room toi about 60 per cent, of the pre-war total of visitors from overseas, including visitors from the Dominions. The shortage is explained partly by bomb damage, partly by the difficulty in putting derequisitioned hotels back into service again. For example, labour and materials can only be spared in very limited quantities from the all-important housing programme which clearly must have an overriding priority. Paint is in short supply and the Board of Trade estimates that the amount of furniture, blankets, carpets and so forth available next year will be far below the pent-up demand. In spite of these handicaps the Government does not wish to continue saying No ” t0 would-be tourists. Apart from the publicity value of direct contacts with this country the foreign visitor s contribution to the balance of payments should become very important. Before the war the expenditure of foreign visitors formed an “invisible export” amounting to some 30 million sterling annually. It should be possible to reach a much higher figure when in a few years time we can provide the accommodation and amenities which we lack at present. All the Departments concerned have therefore been asked to do all they can to facilitate visits from abroad, short of giving the foreign visitor priorities or privileges denied to the home public. It is clear that in view of the difficulties already enumerated, tourist publicity will have to be cautious in tone.x We shall have to explain that, while we should like to welcome visitors on a pre-war scale, conditions originating from our war effort still make it impossible for [32880—5] B 24 us to do so. We must in particular be careful not to counter our own food publicity by suggesting that Britain next year will be a land of plenty. It may be necessary to point out that as we are a democracy we do not allow anyone, even our guests, to have special privileges where food is concerned. The organisation responsible for the preparation of tourist publicity is still the semi-official Travel Association of pre-war days. It is an officially recognised, though not an official organisation, with the status of a company limited by guarantee, receiving a Government grant on the vote of the Board of Trade of for every ;£! received from its members—railways, hotels and shipping companies. The future of the Travel Association is uncertain. It may, however, be merged into a new organisation of a more official character which, by direction of the Cabinet, is to be established under the aegis of the Board of Trade to deal with the whole field of catering, accommodation and holiday facilities for the home public as well ^ as for foreign visitors. Whatever organisation ultimately becomes responsible for overseas tourist publicity it may be assumed that we shall have to work closely together and that Information Officers will carry out on behalf of this new organisation publicity functions of the same nature as those which they now undertake for the Board of Trade in any country which is a tourist potential. We shall be writing to you fully about this later on. Obviously in some countries it would be fruitless to take any action for some years to come. Meanwhile, as the Travel Association will still be in operation for the next few months, whatever its ultimate future, we have asked the Board of Trade that we may be kept fully informed of the Travel Association’s plans. Conference of European Information Officers. A very successful conference attended by Information Officers from European posts was held at Carlton House Terrace from the 14th to 19th October. At the conclusion of the conference the Information Officers were received by the Secretary of State. Policy and administrative questions were explained by senior officials of the Foreign Service and discussions followed. General Sir Ronald Adam, the Chairman, described the work and policy of the British Council and^^ Mr. Marquand, the Secretary for Overseas Trade, spoke on trade publicity in foreign countries. There were a number of meetings with the Director-General and other officials of the C.O.I. to discuss various aspects of publicity production and distribution. The opportunity was taken to visit the “ Britain Can Make It ” Exhibition. It is hoped to hold such conferences regularly in future, and to provide similar opportunities for Information Officers from posts outside Europe. Yours ever, Information Policy Department.■■m CONFIDENTIAL Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1, % 20th December, 1946 b- M U .. uir - . INFOiniATION NEWSLETTER No. 6 Dear Information Officer, We have decided to devote the whole of the current Newsletter to an account of the policy and organisation of the with special reference to the Overseas and European Services. We feel that Information Officers will welcome some background information about a service of such importance to our work. We have therefore included a brief summary of some of the wavelength problems which have created, / ' v nd may continue to create, difficulties in the dissemination of the B.B.C’s. Overseas Service. In connexion with this Newsletter you should refer to I.D. Circular No. 11 of 24th September on “ The distribution of broadcasting functions among the Information Departments of the Foreign Office.” Broadcasting Policy In July 1946 His Majesty’s Government issued a White Paper setting out its decisions regarding the future of the B.B.C. as the Corporation’s present Charter expires on 81st December, 1946. Copies of the White Paper were sent to Information Officers at the time, but it may be useful to recapitulate the main conclusions :— (1) The Corporation’s Charter and Licence will be renewed for a period of five years from 1st January, 1947. (2) The P.M.G. will be responsible to Parliament for the Broadcasting Vote (as hitherto) but the Lord President will answer Parliamentary questions on broadcasting policy. (3) The present prohibition of commercially sponsored programmes will be main tained and all steps will be take to prevent the direction of such broadcasts to this country from abroad. (4) A third programme for Home listeners will be introduced in the Autumn of 1946. (This, as you will know, has occurred ; the effect of the introduction of this programme on the availability of wavelengths for the European Service is dealt with below.) His Majesty’s Government’s decision concerning the European and Overseas Services of the B.B.C. are of such special importance to us in our work that we are quoting more extensively from the relevant paragraphs of the White Paper. The Maintenance of the European Service (paragraph 58) ” The Government have considered the future of the foreign language services, and have come to the conclusion that, in the national interest and in order to main tain British influence and prestige abroad, it is essential that many of the services should continue .... Moreover, there are clear indications at present that other Powers intend to continue to use the broadcasting medium to put their point of view 18884—5 [32847]2 before the European audience, and we cannot afford to let the British viewpoint go by default.” The Character of the Overseas Services (paragraph 59) ” The Government consider that the Overseas Services of the Corporation should continue to be conducted in the most effective manner possible, consistent with economy in money, man-power and wavelengths; and that every endeavour should be made to secure the acceptance by Overseas broadcasting authorities of as many of the Corporation’s programmes as possible for rediffusion over their national net works. The Government would also welcome acceptance by the Corporation of suitable foreign programmes for rediffusion in the services for Home listeners.” Overseas Services Finance (paragraph 80) ” The cost of all Overseas Services (Empire and Foreign) will be covered by an annual Grant in Aid and will not be a charge against wireless licence revenue. The r-% present cost of the Overseas Services is about £4 million per year.” Contact between the Corporation and Government Departments regarding the Overseas Services (paragraph 60) ' The Government intend that the Corporation should remain independent in the preparation of programmes for overseas audiences, though it should obtain from the Government Departments concerned such information about conditions in those countries, and the policies of His Majesty’s Government towards them, as will permit it to plan its programmes in the national interest.” In the debate on the White Paper in the House on 16th July, the Lord President of the Council stated that: ” The Corporation will accept the guidance of the Foreign Office on the nature and scope of the foreign language services.” But it has since been agreed between the B.B.C. and His Majesty’s Government that this did not mean any change in the policy laid down in the White Paper, and that there should be no restriction on the Corporation’s independence in the preparation of Overseas programmes. The B.B.C. are thus constitutionally at liberty to reject any advice which we may give them, although when such advice is properly tendered, it may be assumed'' N -- Nfc that it will be accepted. * s The new Licence and agreement between the Postmaster-General and the B.B.C. will, however, lay on the B.B.C. the obligation to transmit programmes to such countries in such languages and at such times as may be specified. Foreign Office Relations with the B.B.C. A close liaison is maintained between the B.B.C. and the Foreign Office. Major- General Sir Ian Jacob, who was appointed Controller of the European Service in May, has weekly meetings with Mr. Kirkpatrick. On the Departmental level there are weekly meetings attended by representatives of the Political and of the Information Departments of the Foreign Office and by representatives of the B.B.C. In addition, the various regional Departments of the European Service are in day to day touchwith the Foreign Office Departments concerned to obtain the guidance necessary to the planning of programmes “ in the national interest.” A similar policy is followed in the case of the Latin American, Middle East and Far East Services, which belong to the Overseas Service under the controllership of Mr. J. B. Clark, though the liaison in respect of the English language services is not, and does not need to be, so close. The Problem of the Wavelengths It is important that Information Officers should know something of the difficulties arising from the shortage of frequencies in order that they can meet any complaints which may arise about the inadequacy of some B.B.C. Services. ^ It should be realised, incidentally, that the B.B.C. has the most effective service f overseas broadcasts in existence. The European Service still transmits for 37 hours daily as compared with 40—50 during the war; the Latin American and Middle Eastern Services have been fully maintained, while the Far Eastern Service has been extended. The main threat to the maintenance of overseas broadcasting at its present level is the shortage of available wavelengths. Long and medium wavelengths, which are used in the European Service (in addition to short wavelengths) have up to now been allocated by regional conferences on the basis of the need of the domestic broadcasting systems of individual countries. As these needs have been greater than the numbers of wavelengths available for broadcasting, the competition has been acute, and the eventual allocation has only been reached after months of hard negotiation. If, in addition to their domestic needs, countries claim wavelengths for services to foreign audiences, the task of the next European regional conference is likelv to be hard indeed, though it is possible that some increase may be made in the number of long and medium wavelengths available for broadcasting. ^ The present position as regards the long and medium wavelengths used by the .CiUiopean Seivice is as follows. During the war the B.B.C. on security grounds abolished the regional services, and synchronised the stations on a limited number of wavelengths, thus liberating a number of medium wave frequencies for use in the European Service, then greatly expanded. At the end of the war the B.B.C. naturally wished to restore regional broadcasting, which would obviously deprive the European of a number of wavelengths. After due deliberation the Cabinet decided that / iwo medium wavelengths were to be left to the European Service. This entailed the amalgamation of the Midland and Western Begional Services. Dissatisfaction in the West of England became so great that the Cabinet felt obliged to cancel the proposed amalgamation, thus reducing the European Service to only one medium wavelength, supplemented at present by the use of a medium wave transmitter at Norden in Germany to carry German, Austrian, Polish and Czech transmissions. The European Service is also carried on one long wavelength station at Ottringham in Yorkshire, inherited from the war. Under the Lucerne Convention we have no right to this wavelength and may not be able to retain it indefinitely. There are also considerable uncertainties with regard to the short-wave' bands They have to be shared between various users, such as international telephones and telegraphs, civil aviation, shipping and the Service departments as well as broad-casting. Before the war broadcasting on short waves was a new art and could claim only a small share of the wavelengths available. During the war it expanded rapidly, but so did the demand from the other users. Hitherto there has been no allocation of short wavelengths in the broadcasting bands to individual countries, and their use has been secured on a priority basis by means of registration at the Berne Bureau of the International Telecommunications Union. Proposals have now been put forward for allocating short wavelengths to countries on similar lines as long and medium wavelengths, though claims would nc f of course, be confined to domestic broadcasting. Although the United Kingdom c£ put forward a strong claim for a fair share of short wavelengths, we are unlike to obtain as many as are at present in use by the B.B.C., and a cut in the Oversei Services will probably be necessary. Assisting the B.B.C. At the Conference of European Information Officers referred to earlier in this Newsletter, Mr. Kirkpatrick urged that Information Officers should do all they could to reinforce the power of the B.B.C. They could, he said, do this in two ways, by publicity for the B.B.C. programmes and by co-operating in Listener Research. Information Officers could not be expected to conduct Gallup polls in their countries, but they could report such evidence con cerning listening as came their way and could keep a constant watch on B.B.C. output so that they were in a position to advise the B.B.C. on the impact of their transmissions on the population of their area. A great deal is already being done in this direction, though in many areas more for the Home than for the Overseas and European Services, which from our point of view are by far the most important. A general directive on the whole question of publicity for the B.B.C. will be circulated shortly. London Transcription Service In addition to the B.B.C’s. own transmissions the London Transcription Service maintained by the B.B.C. could in many areas be used to even greater adva than at present. There is first-class material available, both music and talks. We have suggested to the B.B.C. that in countries where the London Tran tion Service is not already extensively used, Informal ion Officers should be able to develop this service through local radio stations. It may be useful if you will give general consideration to this question pending results of our approach to the B.B.C. (and of decisions concerning the future development of the L.T.S.) which will be communicated to you. A postcript—the Ministry of Labour has asked that Labour Attaches may be allowed to see our Information Newsletters. Will Information Officers concerned please let their Labour colleagues see the previous numbers as well? Yours ever, Information Policy Department.a&amp;mmmmm jj }Lr 6 CONFIDENTIAL Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1, 19t/? June, 1947 INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 9 Dear Information Officer, We have received a number of enquiries concerning the attitude to be adopted in dealing with stories that “ Britain is down and out,” and this letter is an attempt to answer them. Our present situation has been represented as one of imminent collapse, not only by foreigners, but even in articles in the British press or distributed by British news agencies. ^ In some countries this picture has been contemplated with relish, in others with a varying mixture of regret and satisfaction. There are, however, a number ^ of welcome exceptions to this general rule, and reports from several European countries have indicated, even at the time of the coal crisis, an encouraging faith in our ability to pull through any situation, however formidable. Mr. Bevin, in his speech in the House of Commons on 16th May, has given a fair indication of the line which we should follow. He said :— ‘‘His Majesty’s Government do not accept the view that we have ceased to be a Great Power, or the contention that we have ceased to play that role. We regard ourselves as one of the Powers most vital to the peace of the world, and we still have our historic part to play. The very fact that we have fought so hard for liberty, and paid such a price, warrants our retaining this position; and, indeed, it places a duty upon us to continue to retain it. I am not aware of any suggestion, seriously advanced, that, by a sudden stroke of fate, as it were, we have overnight ceased to be a Great Power. I know our difficulties. But, looking round the world, and, I hope, making an impartial examination of what is going on, I am pleased with the speed at which we have converted this country back to peace-time production. I am really proud of the part we are playing, and I say we have nothing to apologise for considering, as I have ^ already said, that we have been mobilised one day in three for the last 80 years. The progress we have made in the last two years is a worthy contribution to the recovery of the world from the second world war. I must say it has never occurred to His Majesty’s Government, nor, I believe, to the British people, to apply for a receiving order in bankruptcy.” Following Mr. Bevin’s line, all Information Officers have no doubt been doing their best to counteract the view that Britain’s position is hopeless. On the other hand, it would be unwise to give the impression that the lowest level has now been reached. Our situation will almost certainly get worse before it gets better. What we want to emphasise is that our long-term prospects are good, and, that being so, we can continue to exercise a powerful influence by virtue of the certainty that our power will continue great. 18859—2 [88788] J12LL- ,, /i K'*Economically we are in a situation which can be compared to our military situation in 1940-41, though it is happily not so serious as in those days. Then we knew that a very difficult time was ahead of us, and w r e could produce relatively little convincing evidence of our capacity to pull through. Now there is a good eal more evidence, and there is no possibility of complete failure, as there was then, t is, however, not sufficient ourselves to have the conviction and certainty that we shall pull through. While we do not want foreigners to underestimate our difficulties (because if they do they may demand more of us now than we are able to deliver) it is important that they should think well enough of our future prospects to be prepared to trust in our future economic and financial strength. Our inter national financial position, and the continued willingness of foreigners to hold sterling balances indefinitely, is largely dependent on their estimate of our future-, strength. I he capacity of our banking and insurance companies to continue to ear. money abroad, and therefore to provide invisible exports, is dependent on the same sort ot factors. / We do not wish here to suggest that a separate campaign of publicity on the subject ot Britain s economic position should now be undertaken. Indeed it is fairly obvious that such a campaign, following the line that Britain is coping successfully with her economic troubles, or that she is going to continue as a powerful influence m world politics, would not be effectual. What we need to do, rather is to see that every opportunity is taken as events occur, in conversation, and in the various forms of publicity output, to see that the right moral is drawn The toilowing paragraphs discuss some of the points which need to be borne in mind.

The exchange problem is for the present greatly intensified for us, even more than for other countries, by the excessively high prices of the primary products which we need to import in greater quantities than others require. 8. We should stress that our situation should be looked at in the right perspective. Many of our present difficulties, as enumerated in the preceding para graph, are clearly of a temporary character. For example, our exchange position will be greatly eased when the terms of trade, as a result of a fall in world prices, especially food-stufts, move in our favour. Similarly our inability to supply as much ^ as, or as rapidly as, our overseas markets require, is a temporary phenomenon. We shall continue to face serious difficulties for five or even ten years. But this is a very short time in the life of a nation. Even our very serious coal problem, which is at the base of most of our present difficulties at home, is capable of solution; it arises out of the need for re-equipment as much as from shortage of man-power. It may be useful to continue to point to the exacerbation of our food difficulties caused by the agricultural disaster which fell upon us during the winter, when we lost over 4,000,000 sheep and lambs, 50,000 head of cattle and 75,000 tons of last year’s crop of potatoes. The floods also seriously reduced our acreage of wheat and of sugar beet and did considerable damage to farm buildings and° equipment. In our normally temperate climate we can reasonably hope that such climatic conditions will not recur, at least for some time. 4. Moral factors are as important as material. There is continued evidence that foreigners visiting this country are favourably impressed by our morale. Every opportunity should be taken to give statements by important visitors wide publicity In 1940, when very many foreigners thought we were finished, it was to an important degree the reports of foreign observers in this country which built up the belief that we were unbeatable. We can also rub in any examples pointing to a high morale. The following extract from the current number of the Midland Bank Review quoted as an admirable example :— “ Some writers and composers of headlines have unhappily referred to the Parliamentary debates upon the White Paper as an “ inquest ” on the national economy. There are few signs that the subject of inquiry is a corpse and the use of such catchphrases contributes merely to loose thinking and confused discussion, if not to alarm and despondency. It is not for the dead bodv of a nation that miners struggled through snowdrifts to reach the pits, or transport workers fought blizzards, frosts and flood, or ships set sail for London, laden with coal, in weather which in less critical times would have kept them port- bound. This is the spirit which should pervade everv phase of our public and business life; it is this spirit which will conquer our difficulties and in due time liberate the people from the trammels imposed by a war of liberation.”4 5. In addition, we should make use oi examples pointing to the skill, resource fulness and adaptability of our people (the discovery of penicillin, invention of radar, our lead in jet-propelled aircraft) and our willingness to accept sacrifices and limita tions to our personal freedom in the common good (for example, the successful operation of food and clothing rationing, resulting in the virtual absence of a black market, the financing of over 50 per cent, of our war expenditure out of taxation, and a balanced budget). The fairness and efficiency of our administrative services which make the burden of our economic shortages shared by all citizens, rich and poor alike, should be stressed. We can also point to the strength which we derive from the solidarity of the Commonwealth, now as during rhe war, shown, for example, by the immediate help in money and in kind which we received during the winter crisis. G. We should take every opportunity of pointing out that we have already, in ^ spite of the dissatisfaction voiced in the home press, accomplished a great deal in the changeover from war to peace, and that in some respects our production is considerably higher than before the war. Eeference should be made to the summary on page 10 of the Economic Survey for 1947 and also to paragraph 8, page 15, of the same document. We can also stress our considerable financial contribution to world recovery and relief amounting to £740 million, including £155 million for U.N.K.R.A. and £140 million for assistance to Germany’s economy. Our progress in providing for the welfare of the individual (see Newsletter No. 4) has been remarkable. There has been a tendency in some quarters at home and abroad to suggest that we cannot and ought not to try to afford the luxuries of social service schemes, a higher school leaving age, and so forth. The answer is that despite our difficulties we are affording them : and this is a demonstration of strength. Public dissatisfaction strongly expressed is indeed a measure rather of the standard which we have set ourselves than of the actual level of achievement. If some of the points we have made in this Newsletter are already so familiar to you that they need not have been made, we hope that you will bear with us. They will not all have been equally obvious to all Information Officers, and we have -. ^ included them because we felt that they would stand repetition. Yours ever, Information Policy Department.CONFIDENTIAL &gt; Foreign Office, S.W.l, 19£7i August, 1947 INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 10 Dear Information Officer, This Newsletter covers four subjects. The major topic is the background to a forthcoming reduction in British publicity expenditure abroad. Other subjects dealt with are the arrangements for the exchange of Parliamentary Delegations, the reorganisation of work in the Information Departments and the distribution of Party political publications. Economies in British Publicity Abroad Although those Missions whose information work will be affected by the forthcoming economies in British publicity abroad will already have been informed of what is proposed, it is important that all Information Officers should be brought into the picture. You will be aware that in the spring the Chancellor asked us to make a substantial cut in this year’s estimates for the Foreign Office Information Sendees and the B.B.C. Overseas Services. As a result it became necessary to take hasty action to put the desired economies into effect. The Secretary of State agreed with some reluctance to these reductions, but he thought it well to point out to the Chancellor that it was impossible to plan our information work overseas except on a long-term basis. He therefore urged that the estimates for the financial year 1948—49 should be prepared as far as possible in advance, so that any necessary economies might be made in an orderly manner. He also asked the Chancellor to agree that in considering expenditure on information work the estimates for the Foreign Office Information Services, the British Council, the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Overseas and European Services, the Central Office of Information and the Stationery Office, should be treated as a whole rather than, as hitherto, in isolation. ^ Finally the Secretary of State emphasised to the Chancellor that the best expenditure of the available money could only be devised on the basis of a three-year plan to be based if possible on the 1948-49 estimates. The Chancellor accepted these proposals but asked that further economies should be made in the 1948-49 estimates. In subsequent conversations with the Treasury it was agreed that an over-all reduction of 10 per cent, should be made in our expenditure on publicity and information work in foreign countries and that the Foreign Office should be left to propose in what proportions the total cut should be spread over the various organisations concerned. A memorandum embodying the proposals for the 1948-49 estimates for work in foreign countries has been prepared and accepted by the Secretary of State and the Chancellor. The detailed implications of these proposals are now being worked out. As regards the Foreign Office Information Services our proposals are based on the 13859—3 34073 B2 principle that an all-round cut would mean-damage in every country, and that it would be preferable to keep our information work at full strength in certain countries while making drastic cuts in other countries where information work is relatively of less importance, or where the British Council and the B.B.C. can to some extent be expected to do what is required. The Secretary of State has decided that we must make every effort to keep up our activities in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Norway, the Argentine, Brazil and Venezuela. Nevertheless if economies can be made in these countries without impairing efficiency, every attempt must be made to achieve them, because of our serious foreign exchange difficulties. We must make quite sure that no money is wasted. In some of the remaining countries separate information staffs will be abolished altogether, and in others will be reduced by the abolition of all or almost all of the operational work, and a small staff kept merely to advise the Head of the Mission and to maintain personal contacts with the local press and radio. In several countries where the information staffs are being abolished or reduced in this way the British Council is being kept up to full strength. In considering the British Council and B.B.C. estimates the Foreign Office will have in mind the same principles, and every effort will be made to spare the services to those countries which are of vital importance. It should be pointed out that the B.B.C., British Council, Central Office and Stationery Office also serve Empire countries and that the Foreign Office-Treasury agreement only relates to those aspects of their work which involve foreign countries. Since some of the economies to be made could not be put into operation without affecting activities also relating to the Empire it was decided that Working 1 arties of the various interested Government Departments should consider the impact of economies on the organisations as a whole. A B.B.C. Working Barty has already started the consideration of the B.B.C.’s 1948-49 estimates and has set itself the objective of achieving an overall reduction of 10 per cent, on foreign and Empire Services alike. . The Chancellor has indicated that if the proposals made in the memorandum referred to above are carried out the Foreign Office may, unless special circumstances arise, prudently plan on the assumption that the estimates proposed for next year shall’form a basis for expenditure for the next three years. ^ The following table gives the approximate present cost of British information work in foreign countries (excluding Germany and Austria): Sterling Foreign Currency Total £ £ £ Information Service ... 150,000 1,850,000 2,000,000 British Council ... 1,800,000 1,450,000 2,750,000 B.B.C. ... 2,850,000 150,000 3,000,000 C.O.I 770,000 770,000 Stationery Office 250,000 250,000 5,820,000 3,450,000 8,770,0003 The Foreign Office proposals for economies, which have been accepted by the Treasury, are as follows :— £ Information Services 188,000 IhB.C. 300,000 British Council 299,000 C.O.I. 77,000 Stationery Office ... ... ... 70,000 934,000 It will be noted that this figure is £57,000 more than the sum required to effect a 10 per cent, cut on present expenditure. A margin is desirable since it may not be possible to liquidate certain commitments at once and, moreover, new demands may be made on us on account of unexpected political developments or further increases in the cost of living in certain countries. Re-organisation of Work of Information Departments of the Foreign Office The reductions of expenditure mentioned above will enable us to make a cut in home expenditures, and we are also under an obligation to do our best to economise in man-power at home. Because of the urgent need to do so, and because in the interests of efficiency it appeared that some reorganisation of the work of the Information Departments of the Foreign Office could be made, a detailed survey of that work was begun in the spring and has now been completed. It became clear from this survey that a good deal of work was being done in the regional information departments which required no special regional knowledge, and which might with economy be performed at a central point. It also became evident that the multiplication of our contacts with the Central Office of Information concerning our demands for their products was inefficient, and that orders for their products ought to be placed through one Department of the Foreign Office. It was plain, too, that the regional information departments were engaged in a good many ^ activities connected with personnel, establishment and finance largely because posts abroad addressed to them correspondence on these subjects. It has therefore been decided that the regional departments shall be relieved of all responsibility for action on personnel, establishment and finance questions, though naturally they will be consulted on matters in which their knowledge is valuable. The ordering of publicity materials from the Central Office of Information is to be centralised in a new section of Information Policy Department. This section will be responsible for laying down for the C.O.I. the specifications of new films, publications, photographs and so forth which we wish to have produced, whether for general or regional use, and for seeing to it that the things they produce for us are satisfactory from the point of view of general policy and technical quality, h 31073 b 24 will also be resjwnsible for vetting the standard products of the C.O.I. which are offered for Foreign Office use, and for selecting from them, ordering them and seeing that they are despatched to posts abroad in suitable quantities. The regional departments will naturally be free, on their own initiative and on that of Information Officers, to suggest the commissioning of new publicity materials, and to lay down the specifications which they think desirable for their territories. They will also be fully consulted as to the suitability for their countries of the things which the C.O.I. produces to our order; and they will equally be invited to pass judgment concerning the suitability, for the regions with which they are concerned, of those of the C.O.I.’s standard products which are passed for general purposes. Much of this consultation can, we hope, be done orally, and a great deal of time should be saved by canalising our correspondence and discussions with C.O.I. We are fully aware of the importance of providing, material which is calculated to achieve the right results in widely differing countries, and we do not intend to try to cram all our publicity materials into a uniform mould. But we are convinced that we shall be able to cater more accurately for the needs of the various parts of the world if we are aide to organise our relationships with the producers in a more orderly manner than that which now exists. All this will take some time to put on a satisfactory footing, and it may be, since a major reorganisation is involved, that for a short time delays in the ordering and delivery of publicity materials will occur. We hope, however, that the new section, which is now being brought into existence, will be working effectively well before the end of the year. Once the section is in operation it ought to be possible for requests from Information Officers for certain types of publicity material to be addressed direct to it, and no longer to the regional departments. If so, appropriate circular instructions will be issued. But for the present |&gt;osts abroad should continue to work to their opposite numbers in the regional departments, who will pass them on. Information Officers should, however, make a practice of writing to the Fj. &amp; F. (Information) Department on establishment, finance and personnel matters and not to the regional departments. Political Party Publications ^ ^ At the end of last year a circular was sent to Information Officers (Circular No. 17 of 7th December) on the subject of the distribution of political party publications. Replies from the majority of posts indicated that copies of such publications were welcomed for reference purposes, while some posts reported that they had received a number of demands for additional copies, mostly from the organisers of local Labour Groups. It should be made clear that there need be no hesitation about encouraging the demand for these publications from suitable quarters. In particular it is important to see that Social Democrat organisations are aware that Labour Party publications can be made available to them, in translation if necessary.The Exchange of Parliamentary Delegations During the past year a number of British Parliamentary Delegations have visited foreign countries, and foreign delegations have visited this country. Ministers have decided that this is a useful way of stimulating interest in and achieving publicity for the British way of doing things, and for the British form of parliamentary government. They may also promote understanding abroad of the difficulties facing this country and the measures taken to overcome them. The Foreign Office is therefore working in close conjunction with the British Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to stimulate such visits. The Inter parliamentary Union is an international body whose aim is “to promote personal contacts between members of all Parliaments, constituted into National Groups, and unite them in common action to secure and maintain the full participation of tneir respective States in the firm establishment and development of democratic s institutions and in the advancement of the work of international peace and co operation, particularly by means of a universal organisation of Nations.” So far as possible the British Group of the Union is being used to provide the machinery for the exchange of these parliamentary visits, but there are certain countries, notably the Latin American republics and Russia, which are not represented in the Union, and for which, in consequence, special arrangements have to be made. In view of the shortage of foreign currency, it is preferable, within the limits of a reasonably reciprocal programme, to entertain foreign delegations here rather than to send British delegations abroad. In the Fordlgn Office the arrangements for the co-ordination of the exchange of visits are in the hands of the Information Departments, who consult with the other Departments concerned. The arrangements for delegations entertained in the United Kingdom are made by the Foreign Office in conjunction with the Government Hospitality Fund. Visits of British Parliamentary Delegations abroad are the concern of the Cultural Relations Department of the Foreign Office. The responsibility for arranging visits in the right order of priority lies in the first place with the Information Policy Department, to which any suggestions for visits ^hould therefore be addressed. Yours ever, Information Policy Department.■1 Circular No. 95 [ XS031/37/47 ] 4 RESTRICTED Foreign Office, S.W. 1, 14^ October, 1947 My dear Consul General/Consul SINCE my circular of 14th October last year we have been increasingly under the threat of the financial and economic crisis that developed m August. For the Foreign Service this means the closest scrutiny of all expenditure of foreign exchange and continuing pressure to save United Kingdom-based man-power. As a result of discussions with the Treasury, we have got the conditional and limited assurance given in paragraph 3 of Sir Orme Sargent's circular No. 0145 of 8th August, i.e., that it is reasonable to plan on the assumption that the present establishment of United Kingdom-based staff can in most posts be maintained so long as the load of work remains roughly the same. The exceptional cases have been notified separately. We can only hope that we have thus some more or less firm ground to go on. But even so a continuing responsibility for economy is left with us and any saving that can be made in the cost of our operations or in men should be put into force with the least possible delay. With this in mind, a thorough review of our communications system has been made with the help of the newly appointed Director of Communications, Brigadier Gambier-Parry, and the results will shortly ^ 1^ circulated. What is more, all posts have been asked by the Permanent nder-Secretary in his letter of 8th August to send a brief review at the end of the year detailing any economies that have been or can be made. If these things can achieve sufficient saving we shall have a good chance of avoiding an indiscriminating axe on the service as a whole. In any event we shall try to ensure that the last thing that is cut is the remuneration of those who will still be employed in the Foreign Service. This follows from the fact that one of the first two objectives which the Foreign Secretary had was to get agreement for a firm basis for the calculation of allowances abroad. This basis has in fact been achieved, as you have seen in a number of circulars and in the fact that 14333—1 34286—4a !U12 we have since last year published the new Regulations and conditions of service for all regular and established branches of the Service, i.e., Branch A, administrative, Branch B, executive and clerical, Branch C, shorthand-typist and typist, while the Regulations for Branch D, Chancery Servants and security guards, will be ready very soon. There remains the task of bringing these things into full force in all posts abroad. For this we are dependent on visits by Inspectors, and by the end of this year most countries will have been visited. From those that have not or from those that have without results to cover all the staff, we would ask indulgence. The Inspectors have had to try to cover as much as they can as quickly as possible, and in many countries nothing like stability has yet been reached. During the next year we shall hope with their help to tidy what was missed or skimped this year. We shall also hope to regularise and bring some improvement into the conditions of service of all our temporary and unestablished members, including King’s Messengers. So far as pay and allowances go for members of the Foreign Service stationed in London, all will by now know of the scheme of Home Service Allowances which are payable to officers transferred to posts at home after service abroad, and they now form part of the published regulations. You will be glad to hear of a further recent improvement in pay for many of those working at home. The Government have decided that in view of the critical man-power situation, it will not be possible to bring the number of weekly working hours below the present “ emergency standard ” of 45-|, and that this will continue until the end of 1949. On the other hand, financial compensation will be paid to those with salaries of less than £1,200 per annum who are not normally eligible for overtime payment. In the case of established staff this extra duty allowance will be 8 per cent, of emoluments, excluding, e.g., Home Service and Resident Clerks’ allowances. Heads of departments have to certify that members of their departments are required to and d~ work at least 45| hours a week. Last year I wrote about the back log with which we were faced. I regret to say that it is still with us. There have been some special as well as basic reasons for this. The special reasons are that we have had to arrange to take over a number of new posts in the Persian Gulf, Persia, Afghanistan and Nepal, as a result of transfer of power in India on 15th August. In addition, we have had to provide staff for the Dominions of Pakistan and India, as well as for Burma. All these things have meant a great deal of detailed work over staff, establishment and housing. In addition, the cost of living and the rate of exchange have varied in a large number of countries, both of which■■ ■■■■■■ 3 things tend to create a special problem. Apart from these special circumstances, three basic things are needed before we will normally be able to guarantee quick answers to questions. First, agreed schemes to apply which are known to all and comparatively simple to administer. Secondly, trained staff in the departments at home to deal with the work. Thirdly, the right organisation at home. We have, as said, made a lot of progress on the first of these things. May I say that we shall be greatly helped if all members of the Foreign Service will familiarise themselves with the Regulations and the terms of our various circulars. The Regulations have appeared piecemeal as we have got approval for the terms for each Branch of ^the Service, and in consequence they will need to be re-edited within a year or two, when we will also try to issue some form of extended ^ commentary showing how the Regulations are applied in all normal cases. Much work will then be saved and some disappointments avoided, for our object is that everyone shall be fully aware of exactly what he is entitled to and what he is not. For the best we can do is to apply the most favourable interpretation of these agreed documents. Indeed, it would be impossible if it were otherwise and we were in any position to distribute favours. We shall of course try to get improvement when possible in our agreed terms of service. 'But until any change is published we must be bound by the known rules. The second takes time and we depend very largely on the new entry into Branch B for the staff we need. Meanwhile we will do our best, but there is no short cut to get results. On the third, I circulated last year the table of organisation of the four administrative Departments, Personnel, Finance, Establishment and Organisation, and Establishment and Finance (Information). Now that we are getting unified schemes for the whole Foreign Service some reorganisation is desirable. Up to now the sections of Establishment and Organisation Department have ^been functional, i.e., separate sections for Diplomatic, Consular, &amp;c. The sections of Establishment and Finance (Information) have been territorial, but have also dealt with personal and financial questions. During the course of the next year we shall gradually amalgamate the Establishment and Finance (Information) Department with the Personnel, Finance and Establishment and Organisation Departments, allotting the appropriate work to each of these three Departments. In addition, the Establishment and Organisation Department will be recast on a territorial basis. The upshot will be that the administration of the Information staff will in fact be integrated with the administration of the diplomatic, consular and commercial diplomatic staff, and in the Establishment Department all the establishment problems of any givencounti} Vv ill lie dealt with in the same section. This is obvious common sense for an integrated Foreign Service, and next year I shall hope to circulate revised charts of the three Administrative Departments as they will then be. But it will not be an easy operation in the early stages and some maladjustment for a number of months will be the inescapable price of improvement later. I be second main objective which the Foreign Secretary had last \eai was more space for the Foreign Service at home. Despite every eliort and the Foreign Secretary’s personal intervention it has only just become possible to get any allocation. Shortly we will take over a fui thei large part of the India Office and the main policy makin 0, departments, political and economic, of the German Section will move i -V 1 !® Wl11 glve a little more elbow room in the old main Foreign ^ Office building, some half dozen rooms to be exact, and will enable us o do such necessary things as provide a waiting room for visitors on the Permanent Under-Secretary, who till now have had to wait in a corner of the stair-well. But we shall not be able to move any outlying departments into the main building and we cannot be properly concentrated until a new Foreign Office is built. The proposal for that is that the site in Carlton House Terrace to the right and left of the Duke of York's column should be used and % P w n u aS been d b a Y n U P b y an Architect appointed by the Ministry °c Tr 01 . 5 de ^°i ssons , in accordance with the recommendation of the National Fine Arts Commission that the Nash elevation should be retained. This plan is now under consideration. It is, of course a long-term project and may be further delayed by the revision of all building programmes in the present emergency. Last year I finished by asking for your indulgence and help. It is plain that I must do so again; for all those in the Administrative Departments will need these things. We shall continue to work hard and overtime and we mean that everything shall be all right on th&lt;v- ^ the' d BUt a§ S ° ° ften m administration ’ to -day is unfortunately not yet Yours sincerely, HAROLD CACCIA, Chief Clerk.CONFIDENTIAL Foreign Office, S.W. 1, 17th October, 1947. XA INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 11 Deal- Information Officer, ^ In Information Newsletter No. 9 we gave some guidance on the line to be adopted in dealing with stories that “ Britain is down and out.” We wTote at the time that the situation would certainly get worse before it got better. It has got worse. But our difficulties are apt to be attributed entirely to our own short comings and the extent to which we have already tackled them to be underestimated. The object of this letter is to help you to put things in the right perspective. Apart from coal and textiles, and certain lesser industries, we are well ahead of 1988, and our record of productivity and exports is far better than that achieved after the last war. Our trouble is that the war has left behind a set of circumstances which call, not for mere improvement on the achievement of the 1930’s, but for a complete reorganisation of the economic side of our national life, and for an effort of almost unparalleled intensity. This effort has already begun. It is the bills that are coming in that are the trouble. All the points made in Information Newsletter No. 9 are as valid now as a few months ago. One is particularly relevant to the present situation. We wrote that our chief problems were likely to be concerned with foreign trade and exchange and were not primarily internal in character. This last is a point of great importance at the present time, since an admittedly difficult financial and economic situation h as be . en highlighted by external financial causes, a scramble on the part of other ountries to secure dollars following “convertibility” on 15th July. The Government’s plans to meet the situation were outlined 'in Sir Stafford Cripps’s address on 12th September to leaders of industry and labour and in his subsequent broadcast. (The former was carried in full by L.P.S.) At the beginning of August the Prime Minister had announced import cuts of £228 million. They still left an uncovered adverse balance of £872 million. To meet this, new overall export targets have been fixed at 143 per cent, of the 1988 volume by May 1948, rising to 164 per cent, by the end of next year. This involves an immediate monthly increase of £31 million on the current average monthly fimire of £90 million. Even by raising our exports by an additional one-third we shall only be able to maintain standard of living based upon the new programme 13859—4 34386 'of import cuts, most of which have not yet come into operation or had time to make themselves felt, and the standard will be further depressed by the fact that unless and until production increases the growth of our exports can only be achieved at the expense of the home market. To return to the living standard of a few months ago we must increase our exports by 50 per cent.; to return to pre-war days they must be doubled. Since the publication of this programme there should have been no difficulty in countering any idea that the British Government was without plans to meet the emergency or that the British people w r ere not aware of what lay before them. What is important now is to answer the question “What chance have we got of succeeding? ’’ Sir Stafford Cripps pointed out in his broadcast that “there is no doubt that, with the factory capacity and labour that we have in this country we can produce more goods than we are doing now.” There is nothing impossible in the task, itself. The only really effective argument to show what can be done will be evidence of a further substantial rise in production, particularly in coal, but the very con siderable amount that has been accomplished since the war shows that far from having slipped downhill during the past few years we have in fact moved upwards. This in turn should help to dispel any impressions that we are incapable of the greater effort. In paragraph 6 of Information Newsletter No. 9 we turned to this theme and referred to pages 10 and 15 of the Economic Survey for 1947. In this Survey it was stated that by the end of 1946 ‘ ‘ the rate of national output was not significantly below pre-war over the country as a whole,” but this came out before the publica tion of the latest White Paper on the “National Income” tCmd. 7099), and sub sequent analyses have indicated that the Economic Survey tended to understate the position. In its leading article of 2nd August, for example, the Economist wrote :— “ It is certainly not true that the aggregate output of all goods and services is low. On the contrary, it is very high, judged by any of the available tests. The estimates of national income, when adjusted by any reasonable allowance for the change in prices, show a higher level than in i938. All the familiar indications of general business activity give the same result. Steel production, the volume of traffic on the railways, the consumption of gas and electricity—^ all of these are above, and some of them well above, their pre-war levels. Even the consumption of coal in this country-—as distinct from its production —is no lower than it was before the war. There is really very little room for doubt that the aggregate output of the British community lo-day is from 10 to 20 per cent, higher in volume than it was in 1938.” The Annex to this Newsletter contains a list prepared by the Board of Trade giving the increases and decreases in the post-war volume of production. These figures at least refute the view that Britain is incapable of recovering. Coal and cotton spinning are serious problems, but the present figures are capable of rational explanations which suggest the possibility of great improvement. The difficulties of the inter-war years, unemployment and the neglect of equipmentresulting from lack of demand have been stressed too often to need repetition. But the war itself was the greatest direct contributor to the coal industry’s decline. The sudden loss of virtually the whole of our export trade in 1940, before our war industry had grown to the scale which it reached in 1943, led to a great, though temporary, and relative over-production in the mines. Miners left the industry to join the forces and other forms of employment to the number of 51,000 in a single year. By 1941 the labour force in the mines had fallen 84,000 below the 1938 figure. Another result of the war is the higher age composition. Out of an approximate total of 700,000 men in the industry 150,000 are over 50. This is being gradually offset by the intake of recruits, though the training which they require takes skilled men away from the pits to teach them. A recent letter in The Times pointed out that the output of American soft-coal miners was 5’2 tons a man a day as compared with an output of about 1 ton a man a day in this country. This is the kind of misleading statement which is apt to gain wide currency. The basic reasons for this wide disparity, which the letter in question mentions but does not sufficiently stress, are the great advantages possessed by the American mines in having far wider seams and far less deep pits and the fact that there is a far greater proportion of open-cast mining in America. Even when the British mines have been completely modernised and some twenty new pits sunk, the average output is not likely to exceed 2 tons a head for the total number of employees in the industry at the most. The physical nature of the coal resources is the limiting fat-tor here. But there is no reason to believe that we shall not, once again, be able to produce coal and sell it abroad more cheaply than it is produced in America. And, from the immediate point of view more important, we have had sufficient confidence in our prospects to promise at Paris that we would begin to export coal again next year. Again the low production of cotton yarn is mainly the result of conditions created by the war. The chief problem of the industry is the labour force which is short of 40,000 operatives. Indeed, the textile industry as a whole has 230,000 fewer workers than in 1939. During the war a large percentage of the labour in the mills was directed to war industries, often in other parts of the country. At the end of the war these industries changed over to civilian production and retained The former textile operatives, who were unwilling to return to their former employ ment because they had settled down where they w-ere and because of the higher wages, standards of comfort and working conditions offered by recently built factories. The modernisation of the textile factories must necessarily be a slow process in view of the heavy calls on building material and labour. It may be argued that an export plan is all very well on paper, but that no indication has been given so far of positive steps to make it w'ork. We should therefore stress that in a democratic community w 7 e are not prepared to use com pulsion except as a last resort. Sir Stafford Cripps made this clear when he said : “We do not propose to use industrial conscription unless there is no other way out.’’ But a limited direction of labour will be in force from the beginning of 34336 o ^4 October when there will be direction into essential work of those who lose or leave their employment, although only unmarried men may be directed away from their homes. There will be an allocation of priorities in fuel and raw materials to the export industries as a result of which it may be expected that a considerable number of workers in the less essential industries will be seeking re-employment and will therefore be available for direction where required. Finally we can rebut the arguments of those who place the blame for our balance of payments difficulties on our improvidence by pointing out that in 1940 imports w r ere two-thirds of the 1988 level as volume, and exports only 10 per cent, below. This means, translated into money terms, that if no other change had taken place we should have had a surplus of £150 million in 1946 as against a pre-war deficit of £70 million. Our present adverse balance of £600 million is due to circum stances beyond our control or to our international commitments. Of the former class, by far the most serious is the worsening of our terms of trade—that is, the disproportionate rise in the prices of our imports relative to the rise in those of our exports. The index figures for June 1947 were 245 (1988 = 100) for the prices of our imports and 227 for those of our exports. Another factoi beyond oui contiol is the loss of our overseas investments during and since the war and the increase in our overseas liabilities, with its corresponding burden of interest payments. Our international commitments entail heavy governmental expenditure overseas, including the maintenance of large armed forces, particularly in Germany, the provision of supplies (largely from dollar sources) for the German population and subscriptions to and other expenditure on numerous international bodies. The figures given above should incidentally serve to rebut one charge often made against us—that we are attempting to maintain our pre-war standards of consumption in radically reduced circumstances. In fact, not only are our imports at about 80 per cent, of the 1988 volume, but a larger proportion of them than pre-war consist of raw materials required for manufacture of exports, and they have to meet the consumption needs of an increased population (49 million as against 47,/60,000 in 1938). It should be made clear that these plans have had to be made, of necessity, on the assumption that no help would be forthcoming under the Marshall Plan. In so far as we do receive assistance it will be possible both to shorten and to ease the difficult period ahead. In the notes for the press on the Report of the Paris Conference (a Report which Information Officers will find of great value to them) it was stated that if a co-operative effort were made by Western Europe and the United States we could prepare a reasonably long-range plan. If, however, no such co-operative effort were possible we should have to work out a very different sort of plan. It was not that we should have to do more if we had to solve our dollar problem alone but that we should do quite different things. We have, in fact, to have two plans. If it is suggested that the estimates we put forward at Paris, for imports and exports, do not accord with those put forth at home, the answer is that the latter have had to be made, not on the basis of reconstruction contemplated at Paris, butMMtaammmmmmmmrnamm 5 as desperate measures taken to ensure survival. We cannot pretend that unless our and the world’s dollar problem is solved our prospects of a satisfactory and improving standard of living are good, for many years to come. Marshall aid can make all the difference between a reasonably early recon struction and one which may take as long as that which followed the Napoleonic wars (which were followed by the great era of Victorian prosperity). There is no doubt which is preferable, for our own sake and that of others. But we shall certainly come out on top sooner or later. Yours ever, Information Policy Department. (Note. —The C.O.I.

DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS SERVICES IN THE PERSIAN GULF.Extract taken from SECRET letter No.Ext.2837/47 from E.P. Donaldson, Esquire, Commonweilth Relations Office, London to Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain It is thought that in the future there will be scope for development of publicity services in the Gulf, since the maintenance of British influence will probably in future entail' a greater use of publicity than hitherto. I am asked by the Foreign Office to put the following proposals for consideration; ■ in principle reading room at Kuwait, with possibility that a second might bel needed in the Kuwait Oil Company's area (if they decide to house'their local employees at Burgan) and perhaps at Muscat. They envisage providing material for m a 1 Bahrain'' and books and reading matter, for the schools in Bahrain and Kuwait. 6. A further tentative suggestion which may be considered and!! on which your views would be welcomed concerns the material put' out in the B.B.C. Arabic broadcasts received in the Gulf States'- It is realised that there may not be many wireless sets in the States yet, but is thought that we should try to ensure that the broadcasts heard by the people who do own them are suitabled (I have already addressed you separately on this subject - my letter No ..Ext. 2590/47 of 3rd December). 7. The other possible medium of activity is films, although there are, as we know, many obstacles in the way of providing for the showing of suitable films. It is therefore thought that this is a possibility which must be borne in mind and suggested to you for your consideration, although it is a possibility to be envisaged for five years’ time rather that at present. 8. Assuming that you agree that this development of InformatiJ! activity would eventually be justified, the present intention ! is that the present level of activity should be maintained, sayj for a period of six months after the transfer of responsibility ;] to the Foreign Office. Subject to your concurrence, it is proposed that, during that period at any rate, information work 1 should be under the control of youp Secretary, and after the nsw new system had been in operation for that that time you would be in a better position to report on the future of Information work in the area.

All the information contained in the attached statement has been made public. We feel that it may be useful to you to have a summary of our policy to provide talking points or for communication to the Press. Yours ever, Information Policy Department. New Plan for the Level of Industry and Reparations in the Anglo-American Zones of Germany The Allied Control Council, acting on behalf of the four occupying Powers, agreed in Berlin, in March 1946, to a “ plan for reparations and the level of post-war German economy.’' The proposals made in this plan were, however, based on certain assumptions which have not been fulfilled. 2. It was assumed for example that the population of post-war Germany would be not more than 66*5 million. At the end of October 1946, however, the population of Germany was already almost 66 million, and it is apparent that the return of prisoners of war and refugees, together with the natural increase, will within a few years raise the level well above 66’5 million. The increase up to the present has been greater in the United States-United Kingdom Zones than in the remainder of Germany (19 per cent, as against B per cent.). 3. A further assumption was that Germany would be treated as a single economic unit. The plan was based on the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945, which laid down that common policies should be established in regard to industrial production and allocation, import and export programmes, currency and banking, transporta tion and communications. Germany has not been treated as a single economic unit, nor have common policies been adopted in the fields specified above. 14413 34500 B4. Furthermore, the Soviet Government refused to honour Article 19 of the economic principles of the Potsdam Agreement, which states that:— “ In working out the economic plans of Germany the necessary means must be provided to pay for imports provided by the Control Council in Germany. The proceeds of exports from the current production and stock shall be available in the first place for payment for such imports.” 5. As the agreement of His Majesty’s Government to the March 1946 level of industry plan was made subject to the fulfilment of the assumptions set out above, the plan has never come into force. ^ 6. Moreover, it has been recognised by ah the occupying Powers that this plan contained many errors and would not permit the German people to attain ‘‘the average living standards not exceeding the average of standards of living of European countries (excluding the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R.) ” which was laid down in the Potsdam Agreement. This question was discussed by the Council of Foreign Ministers in Moscow. As it was bound to that of economic unity, no agreement was reached. 7. During the discussions, however, the Russian Foreign Minister proposed a level for the steel industry of between 10 and 12 million tons. As the l$vel agreed for the Anglo-American Zones falls within these brackets, the Soviet Government cannot legitimately claim that their security interest or need for reparations in the form of capital equipment have been prejudiced by Anglo-American action. 8. The basic German policy of His Majesty’s Government has been the attain ment of the political and economic unity of Germany. It is their hope that this will be achieved at the November meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in London. But in the absence of economic unity, His Majesty’s Government had to take effective action in the economic field to administer their Zone of Germany. In conjunction therefore with the United States authorities—their partners in the economic administration of the Anglo-American Zones—a plan setting out the, authorised level of industrial activity in the Combined Zone has been worked ou and promulgated. This plan in no way infringes the Potsdam Agreement. 9. The British and United States authorities recognise that the level of industry for Germany as a whole is a matter for quadripartite discussion, and in drawing up a new plan for the Bizonal area they have given full consideration to the necessity for ensuring that the Bizonal plan can be assimilated to a plan for Germany as a whole. 10. It is the desire and intention of His Majesty’s Government that the level of German agricultural and industrial production in the Bizonal area shall be raised to enable the Germans to provide the maximum quantity of their essential requirements from their own resources and to pay for the remainder. The latter is at present being provided at the expense of the British and American taxpayer, whose total expenditure on essential supplies for Germany from the beginning of8 occupation to the end of 1947 will amount to over £800 million. The United Kingdom contribution includes an outlay in dollars of over £65 million. It is estimated that combined Anglo-American expenditure on food alone during 1947 will amount to over £180 million. Failure to increase German production would mean that the United Kingdom would have to continue to bear an intolerable financial burden and would have to give up hope of receiving any repayment of expenditure on German account. 11. In the revised level of industry plan for the Bizonal area (which was circulated to certain Missions in Europe under reference C.J. 1040/86/182) the /^prohibition on the production of war material contained in the original plan is still maintained. No change is proposed in the arrangements made in the original plan for the prohibition of a number of industries regarded as war potential. « &gt; 12. As you may recall, the French have expressed a fear that the revised plan would enable Germany to recover from the economic aftermath of war more rapidly than other European countries. Certain Eastern European countries have echoed this fear. Calculations made at Paris during the Marshall Aid Conference show, however, that industrial production in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, which in July 1945 was 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, of their combined level of production in 1938, rose to 85 per cent, to 95 per cent, for the last quarter of 1946 and the second quarter of 1947. Yet the corresponding figure for Germany is onlv about 40 per cent. 13. 1 he fear that the Anglo-American level of industry plan carries with it some priority for German recovery over that of other countries is based on a complete misundeistanding of the purpose of the plan, and on confusion between the conception of an authorised level for industry and that of the rate of industrial production. On the other hand, the plan has been attacked from certain quarters on the grounds that its purpose is to restrict German competition in world markets in the interest of oui own expoit trade. These allegations can be categorically refuted since we ^have consistently pressed, on the broadest grounds of European interest, for a ^ substantial increase in the level of industry decreed by the Control Council in March 1946. 14. The function of any plan for the level of German industry is necessarily restricted since its main purpose is to ensure security and, in the words of the Potsdam Agreement, to limit Germany’s war potential.” At the same time it takes into account reparation considerations, the necessity of ensuring the Germans an adequate standard of life, and the importance of enabling Germany to make progress towards economic viability, while at the same time making an appropriate contribution to European recovery. The effect of the plan is to cut down German industry to a level above which it will not be allowed to rise without inter-Allied agreement. It will now be for German administrators to prepare a production plan in order to utilise to the full the authorised capacity of industry, though it will be impossible to fulfil it in its entirety for five or six years.15. The method of implementation of any level of industry plan must be the removal or destruction of industrial capital equipment which is shown to be surplus to the requirement of the plan. In accordance with tlie Potsdam Agreement, most surplus equipment was to be made available as reparations to various Allied countries to “compensate for the loss and suffering which Germany caused to them.” The volume of plant which could be made available to countries entitled to reparations could not be effectively determined until a workable level of industry had been devised for the Zones concerned. The removal of plant except in accordance with a reparations policy based on a level of industry plan would only have disrupted the economy of the Zones and would have been impossible to administer. 16. The first practical effect of the publication of the plan for the level o. f v- industry in the Anglo-American Zones was, therefore, the immediate preparation of a programme of reparations removals which will inter alia assist the economic recovery of the recipient Powers. 17. In consequence a final list of plants in the Bizonal area to be removed as reparations was published on 16th October, 1947. All plants in the Anglo- American Zones which are not mentioned in this list will be retained, except for those in certain prohibited industries such as aluminium, beryllium, vanadium, magnesium, ball bearings, synthetic ammonia, synthetic rubber and synthetic gasoline as well as shipbuilding. The Anglo-American authorities are considering whether these prohibitions slmuld be modified and a further and final announcement regarding these industries will be made in due course. 18. The list as published includes 802 war plants, i.e., plants which w r ere built purely for armament and war purposes. These plants, the dismantling of which has already begun, would have been dismantled or destroyed even in the absence of a plan for reparations. The British and American authorities are satisfied that after their removal no armament plant will be left in the Bizonal area. 19. The list also includes 82 plants other than war plants which at the time of the announcement had already been allocated to reparations as advanced deliveries and which either have already been dismantled or are now in the process of being^j dismantled. 20. The balance, finally, is made up of 347 plants from industries restricted but not prohibited by the Control Council’s plan of March 1946, bringing the total to 681. This figure represents the industrial capacity of the Bizonal area which the revised level of industry plan regards as being surplus to a peaceful German economy. 21. In order to reduce local difficulties to a minimum the German Land Governments have been given the opjortunity of proposing minor local adjustments in well-founded cases. Major alterations will not be accepted, and any proposal for the removal of a plant from the prohibited list must recommend its replacement by another plant from the same branch of industry, of equivalent capacity and value, and from within the same Land. 22. The plan brings to an end the so-called multilateral deliveries reparation scheme under which a number of individual machine tools were removed from5 factories in the British Zone and made available to countries which had suffered from German aggression because of the delay in making complete plants available for reparations. On the other hand, the destruction of machinery and equipment specially designed for the manufacture of armament, such as gun-boring lathes, will continue wherever it has not already been completed. 28. In view of the housing and building situation in the British Zone the British authorities have decided to suspend the destruction of all surplus buildings other than specifically military constructions pending further Allied discussion. 24. The programme of removals is based upon the principle that Germany, -having by her aggression brought incalculable suffering and loss to the Allied ^nations, should make to them what recompense she can. It must be completed as rapidly as possible but it will be timed to minimise the dislocation of production. 25. It is expected that the announcement of a revised level of industry for the Anglo-American Zones and of a final reparations list will have a beneficial effect on the German economy. It has removed the uncertainty as to the ultimate German reparations commitment which was acting as a drag on the German productive effort. The removal of the element of doubt will allow the Germans to plan the most economical use of the plant which is to be left to them. 26. An improvement in Germany’s economic position will be to the advantage of Europe as a whole, but there is no question of favouring Germany at the expense of any other country. It may be recalled that the press communique released after the Tripartite talks in London in August 1947 stated expressly that: “The three delegations agreed that the measures about to be taken should not result in priority being given to the rehabilitation of Germany over that of the democratic countries of Europe.’’ The fixing of a level for industry does not imply that Germany will be given priority in order to reach that level or any special assistance within any specified period of time.II v PKR3IAH GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, ' ,'V No,404-94/l« Dated 14th February, 1948.

INFORMATION NEWSLETTER No. 4. Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1, Dear Information Officer, 11 th October, 1946. The members of the Ministerial Committee on Overseas Information Services have decided that it would be useful to have a statement on paper, for the use of the Government Departments concerned with overseas territories, and for British Information Services abroad, of the principal facts about this country which they would wish to see emphasised. They have therefore caused the attached paper on the “Projection of Britain” to be prepared; it has their approval, and they have instructed that it should be circulated. 2. It was agreed by the Committee that Departments should transmit the paper to their Information Officers overseas with explanations of its purpose and the way in which it should be used. This is therefore an appropriate occasion for an explana tion of the part which w 7 e think the “Projection of Britain” should play in our information work in foreign countries. 3. The principal reason for maintaining our information services abroad is to assist in ensuring the success of the policy of His Majesty’s Government. Publicity must thus be thought of first of all as a means of explaining the action and purposes of His Majesty’s Government, and thus preventing or diminishing the opposition to them which may arise out of misunderstanding and misrepresentations. 4. The objectives of His Majesty’s Government are not, however, limited to selfish ends, as paragraph 2 (b) of the enclosed paper shows. We have a great interest in the spread of British ideas and British standards, as is evidenced by Mr. Bevin’s constant insistence on the importance of improving living standards in the Middle East. 5. The first objective of our publicity in each country must be to deal where appropriate with those aspects of British policy and action which affect and are of primary interest to the people of that country. For this reason among others it cannot be assumed that the projection of Britain in itself should absorb all our efforts. The picture of Britain which we wish to see presented should rather be regarded as the background of our work; the stage setting, without which the play would be unconvincing and incomplete. Different parts of the setting will be required for different scenes of the play. Industrial welfare, for example (see News letter No. 3), is of particular importance in connection with the oil situation in Persia, and the Foreign Office issued a press statement on the subject on the 6th August which you will have seen. 13384—3 [32487]2 6. It is recognised, too, that when we are presenting a picture of Britain we must envisage the kind of picture which will appear in the mind of the individual Persian or American, Peruvian or Siamese, rather than the completeness of the picture we can paint. Events and his local circumstances and surroundings will by and large determine the picture he forms. It would be impracticable to aim at a complete understanding. This therefore is another reason for selection; and the aim should be to leave in the mind of the individual such an impression as will lead him to approve some purpose or purposes of His Majesty’s Government, and which will also make him well disposed towards this country. The goodwill which derives from the development of mutual and improved understanding in matters of common importance is more likely to be permanent than is anything built on descriptions of this country unconnected with current events. 7. Publicity is only one of many means by which His Majesty’s Government pursues its policies in other countries. These means range from military or naval measures and diplomatic representation and various forms of international negotia tion and participation in international bodies to ownership and development of economic resources and assistance to individual traders. Publicity has a part to play in support of many activities, and if it is to be effective it must be closely connected with them. 8. The purpose of publicity must normally be to stimulate action of one sort or another. There are two main kinds of such action with which we are concerned. 1 he first is the sort of action which arises when a favourable foreign public opinion is led to support some development which is of interest to His Majesty’s Government. An important example at present is the development of governmental action in all countries designed to make the best use of food supplies. The second is action by individuals which is itself of value, such as the purchase of British goods, or individual saving of food. It seems probable that the second form of action'will take an increasingly important part among the objectives of our publicity in the future and this will involve selection among the aspects of British life which are to be presented to foreigners, for example, in encouraging the tourist trade. 9. When embarking on publicity activity it is therefore necessary to have clearly m mind the purpose to be achieved, and the methods for achieving it It is also necessary to know what media of publicity are most suited to the job in hand (e.g., exhibitions are, in general, more effective in stimulating individual action of a desirable kind than in so affecting public opinion as to bring about Government action) and it is essential to make as sure as possible that the resources available and the publicity machinery are adequate to do the job. 10. Certain media of publicity which take a long time to prepare, and therefore have their effect long after production work is initiated, are suitable only for the pursuit of long-term objectives : among them are films, exhibitions and books. 11. It is essential to avoid dispersal of our publicity resources over too wide a range of general topics. If we are to make an impact and, in Mr. Bevin’s phrase to get value for money spent, we must concentrate most of our attention on a small number of facets of British life. This is particularly true of publicity through long term media. J o &amp;12. It is in the light of all these considerations that we should consider which aspects of the picture of Britain are of greatest importance at the present moment in most countries of the world. They must be features which support major objectives of His Majesty’s Government. They must have a general appeal to the majority of the people in foreign countries, as touching their interests, and they must lend themselves to publicity treatment through the principal media. IB. Two main points emerge, and they are closely linked. They are :— (а) This country is the leading exponent of social democracy in government. (б) This country leads in concern for the liberty and welfare of the individual through social services and industrial conditions. 14. The current projection of these facets of our life should be done with the following considerations in mind :— (a) We want to see the benefits of social democracy and individual liberty and welfare spread throughout the world. v (b) We are no longer a great creditor country, and until our efforts at trade expansion have produced their effect our balance of payments situation will remain very difficult. (c) Our huge responsibilities for security and freedom in other parts of the world at present limit the contributions we can make to world welfare, and especially the goods we can deliver. (d) In dealing with freedom from want, the food shortage must come first. 15. To sum up, we should use the attached paper as the authoritative basis for the kind of picture of this country which we want to put across. It shows what we want others to think of us, and we should not, in our publicity, describe this country in terms which are contrary to its intentions. But we should primarily direct our effort at improving the understanding and acceptability of current policy and action, and the picture of this country which we present should be used as the background to current events. Yours ever, Information Policy Department.CONFIDENTIAL &gt; THE PROJECTION OF BRITAIN 1. Britain as a Political and Social Democracy (a) Britain is democratic; not merely in a formal sense. British democracy is active and vital. Not only is Government, both central and local, responsible to an electorate based on universal suffrage, and responsive to public opinion, but democracy is at the core of the life of the people. It is not merely a matter of voting. From trade unions and working men's clubs to cultural societies and parish councils, and from town and county councils to Parliament itself, the democratic institutions of Britain are innumerable, and there are few, if any, other countries n which the opportunities for direct participation by the ordinary citizen in demo cratic activities are as great. (b) Britain is free. One of her main contributions to civilisation has been its emphasis on personal freedom, and we have succeeded—where some others have failed—in reconciling liberty and order. Freedom in Britain means something positive—freedom of thought, expression of opinion, religious belief, freedom to organise in political parties, trade unions, Ac., and perhaps, above all, freedom to criticise authority. We wish to see this concept of individual liberty adopted throughout the world. (c) Britain aims at building up a comprehensive system of social services and industrial welfare second to none. We have already become the leading Great Power in their progressive development with legislation providing among other things : (i) a unified system of national insurance for all “ from the cradle to the grave,” covering maternity benefits, sickness benefits, unemployment assistance, industrial injuries, retirement pensions, widows’ benefits and funeral grants; (ii) family allowances; (iii) a national health service designed to improve health as well as to prevent, diagnose and treat illness; (iv) a system of grant-aided primary and secondary education without payment of fees, with milk, meals and medical attention at school, and liberal State and local authority scholarships to the universities; (v) the next step forward will be provision for a system of national assistance to round &gt;ff this social legislation, fill the gaps and finally remove traces of the old -'-n Poor Law. Thus every child or citizen of Britain, whatever the circumstances of his birth and whatever risks of personal fortune he may suffer, will be assured freedom from insecurity, anxiety and want, and equal opportunities, whatever the means of his parents, in regard to health, education and employment, by a compre hensive system of social services the aim of which is to secure the general well-being and happiness of the country’s citizens. (d) Britain has embarked on the greatest experiment in a planned economy in a free society that the world has ever known. She is determined, as far as lies within her power, that the under-employment and the recurrent slumps of the past shall be avoided and that the British people shall be assured employment and a decent and rising standard of life. But it is the aim of our economic planning—still, of course, in its early stages—to secure these objects without prejudicing the essential liberties of every British citizen, including the right to choose his own job. In these plans, both socialised and private enterprise industry have their part to play, and 13523 [32521]the approach to nationalisation is not doctrinaire but practical. The principal aim of policy is, with the aid of modern science and a highly trained and educated body of workers, to increase the goods and services which make up the national income, in the interests of the whole community. (e) Britain is tackling economic and social reconstruction with the same deter mination as she tackled the problems of the war. The figures show how successfully British industry and trade are already re-establishing themselves. These achieve ments, rather than our sacrifices in the war, are the standards by which our position in the world will be judged. (/) British culture is as alive as ever. The world has owed much to Britain’s cultural exports, and British ideas, institutions, literature, sports, &amp;c., have exerted a major influence on modern civilisation. 2. Britain as a World Power (a) Britain is the centre of a world-wide association of peoples. By virtue o this association Britain is one of the major world Powers, and is particularly fitted to take a leading part in international affairs. Britain has both the strength and purpose to carry out her policies. (b) Among the principal aims of British foreign policy are that world peace should be secured through the success of the United Nations and its associated bodies, that world prosperity should be attained and maintained, that food should become plentiful, that the standard of living in the poorer countries should be raised, and that the benefits of the system of social and political democracy which we have developed should be spread abroad. These are the aims of British policy just as truly as it is our aim to increase our export trade and improve our own standard of living. The one contributes to the other. 3. Britain and World Trade (a) Britain’s economic life depends upon international trade. Our market is essential to other countries and their markets are essential to us. The rest of the world cannot be prosperous unless we are prosperous and vice versa. We have lost much of our pre-war shipping and other sources of invisible exports, and have incurred heavy indebtedness overseas. Britain must increase the volume of her exports by 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, if she is to get back her former high level of imports. The world is interested in the success of our drive to increase exportc because— (i) we are the world’s best customer, and the more we sell the more we shall buy; (ii) our exports are equal to any in quality, workmanship and design; and (iii) w T e remain a pioneer in the development of new scientific methods and production techniques. Any delay in this programme of exports is due to shortage of labour and raw materials, and to the expenditure of man-power and financial resources in fulfilling Britain’s international obligations. (b) Britain has committed herself unreservedly to an expansionist economic policy at home and a multilateral system of trading abroad, believing that together these two policies form one in relation to the need for developing the world’s economic resources for the benefit of mankind. We have pledged ourselves to work out,3 together with all nations willing to co-operate, a code for the conduct of international trade and monetary affairs, thus linking our prosperity with that of the world in general. National self-sufficiency is the hand-maiden of restrictionist economics ' and forms no part of our economic thinking or policy. We stand for the greatest possible freeing of world trade from artificial restrictions, and for the development of the world financial system through the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Reconstruction. (c) Britain’s policy is that world food supplies should be distributed in such a way as to combat under-nourishment everywhere. We have, by our policy of rationing at home, led the way in securing an equitable distribution of the world’s food supply. 4. The British Commonwealth and Empire (а) Britain is the centre of a world-wide community of peoples associated for utual benefit and not for the exploitation of one by another. The Dominions are sovereign States, and the Commonwealth is an example of co-operation between States, formulating their foreign and economic policies independently, but none the v less pursuing common ideals. The existence of the Commonwealth is a contribution to peace and security, and the flexibility of its structure makes possible the full co-operation of all its members with wider international organisations. (б) British “Imperialism” is dead, in so far as it ever existed, except as a slogan used by our critics. One illustration of this is our policy in India. (c) The British approach to the complex human and physical problems presented by the administration of backward tropical territories which comprise the greater part of the Colonial Empire is both liberal and dynamic. The comparatively recent date at which British administration became effective in most territories makes more impressive the success with which the first problems of establishing law and order and opening up communications have been tackled. On the sound foundations now established Britain pushes forward with schemes for the enlightenment and welfare of the Colonial peoples and for giving them an ever-increasing measure of self- government. At the same time she tackles with vigour and vision the problems presented by difficult physical conditions. /-n 12t/j September, 1946.11/46 Telegram From To G.T.C. Political Resident, Bahrain.
