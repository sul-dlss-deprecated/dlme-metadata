Yours sincerely, sd/- F.E#Stafford. Lieut-Col# H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E#,Confidential. 0- No.156. Political Agency, Kuwait, Dated the 10th September 1932. Will you please refer to your D.0.No.7063 dated the 25th August. I am afraid that if I replied to your question by a direct answer you would get a wrong impreaslcn of the true state of affairs, so at the risk of wearying you with a rather long letter I am going to give you a somewhat fuller reply than what you perhaps have antici pated. 2. Let me commence first by saying that the Shalkhjd of Kuwait is by no means interested in all the lands held In Iraq or on the Shatt al Arab by persons bearing the 'Al Subah' name. When the great Shaikh Mubarak slew his brothers Hohomed and Jarrah and seized the throne, the children of the murdered men fled to Iraq, and settled down on the Shatt al Arab and in Zubair. There I are mny of t&amp;em toda^ and alifeough they are all connected with the Al Subah family in name, for all practical purposes ^ they may be classed as Iraqis* The decendents of itie above Mohomed and Jarrah own several properties on the Shatt al Arab notably the following:- (a) Al Glrdalan (b) Ajairawiyeh (o) Kut al Zain (d) Al Khor I believe they are all held under Tapu, but I cannot doflnitely state this to be a fact. ISiere is no property called Kut Khalifa as you suggest. Probably it has been confused with (d) Al Khor.mm -2- ae aboT© properties ara today hold in various shares by ShaikHs 3aud, Subah. iQialid and Atherby, Dy j the aons of Mohomed al 3ubah tind also/ahaifch a i Jarrah HtxafMn the son of Jamah al Subah, I ahnn no t go into details as to the manner in nfcich this exiled branch of the house oano to acquire tfie above properties, suffice to say that when Mubarak acquired the Shaikhship of Kuwait and his boothers' faaiilies fled to Iraq, he was loath to leave their children with nol&amp;ing, so settled the above properties on them, on condition that they gave up all claim to any share in the Fao and Farhawiyoh estates which Mubarak retained for himself and his own decendents* Kie only properties which the •sife^Hrtnr Eul8r of Kuwaifc (including the dacendents of Shaikh j Mubarak) is concerned in, are the following:- v. (a) Al FarhaVlyela (b) Al Mutawaah (o) Al Faddagiiiyeii III (d) Al Fao These are the properties liiat are exempt froio. paying BeTenuo to the Iraq Goverraaent f under a I written promise given to the Shaikh of Kuwait by His Majesty's Govermaent, and these are the only properties that we need concern ourselves with, whether we are dis- 5 cussing 'Taxation' matters or 'law Suits', All other properties in Iraq apart from certain house property in Basrah and Ashar, are held by members of the exiled families of the murdered Jarrah and Mohamad and do not concern the reigning family of Kuwait, It is Important to remember this, else we are likely to get confused, 5* How as regards these properties of the Ruler of Suwait and members of his family. These are as mentioned in paragraph 3 above, and I propose below answering your questions as far as they are concerned only, as well as giving a short history of how each cameas well as three very small gardens not shown in the sketch, which lie in the Northern corner of the Faddag -hiyeh and which belong to Daud al Faddagh, Abdullah al Rashaid and Mohomed bin Mishri.ri •'•SS-' if? came Into tte possession of Kuwait. (a) A1 Farhaniyeh . This is a saall garden of about 30 jeribs. It is not held under Tapu docment, but under deed of bequeathment. Its history is interesting. Some 70 years ago during the reign of Shaikh Subah the father of Mubarak, a member of the A1 Zuhair family was in danger of his life and fled to Kuwait. His enemies and the Turks demanded that he diould be surrendered, The Shaikh refused to do so and declared he would die in protecting his guest if necessary, %en the storm blew over, the person saved bequeathed to the Shaikhs of Kuwait for ever the garden called 'farhaniyeh', (b) A1 Mutawaah . This is a large and important property, acquired by purchase. It is held under Tapu document and in Shaikh Mubarak'a name I am told. ^ A1 gaddaafajyeh . This is a very large and important t+loIkj.'Uf*. ^ garden of 800- JeribsVand about 2 miles in length and is situated below Abadan, between the Muquatas K^anas A1 Dowasir and A1 Dora. It is held under Tapu document issued under the orders of the late Sir Henry Dobbs (then Hevenue | ) Commissioner, Basrah), with the exception of tiie 'Bashlyeh' portion and a atrip of faqf property which cuts rl^it yi across the property. sketch below. i Pfi -oP &amp;P-r FfVr'b'DA^HiYSK |e | Tfee history of the Bashiyeh you already know and the reasons Ay Tapu deeds were not Issued ^ymfgrn by Sir H©nry Dobts. MS* !l?here is no kl KharE garden as such. It is tlie aams of the water channel which surrounds the Faddaghlyeh property. Tte name, it is true, was mentioned by me in previous correspondence because some people call £ that portion of land lying between the 'Waqf strip ' and the channel, after the ntrae of the channel# Actually it is incorroot to use tho name as the portion forms part of the ^addaghiyeh. (fi) j l Fao . 2Siis is th® biggest property of all, and lias some 6 miles along the right bank of the Shatt al Arab from Uie mouth upwards. It is not held under Tapu deed having like the Farheniyeh garden Wen acquired under — - - ——— daed of gift seme 800 years ago from the great Baschid al Saadun father of Hasir Pasha al Saadun, and Ruler of the whole of what is today known as the Basrah Vilayet, Ranchid presented the garden known as Al Fao to shaiMi Jabir al Abdullah As Subah grandfather of Shaikh Mubarak for having saved his (Raschid's ) life in battle when the SubaJi and Saadun were fighting side by side, I understand that the original deed of gifw is still held as a treasured possession by the Rulers of Kuwait. I trust the above information will be of aa.lstano, to you. C j I j JI .

The Mdy sold the property on her own behalf and on behalf of her 5 dau^iters, she being the sole executrix under documents issued by the Basrah Sharia Court dated 2nd Muhanram 1324 and 2nd Muharram 1327 respectively. Complete sale deeds weBe drawn up and witnessed by Z7 of the leading notables (ashraf) of Basrah including the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the Naqib of Basrah, Seyed Talib Pasha and six of the leading members of the Al Zuhair family. These documents are still preserved. No Tapu documents were taken out at the time, because as in the case of the Faddaghiyeh property lying on both sides of it, the Turks refused to recognize the sale, unless Shaikh Mubarak agreed to accept Turkish nationality. This on instructions of His Majesty's Govern- ment acting tbrougi the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Shaikh refused to do, I r - | * ^10' -2- 6 0 By Turkish Law, a purchaser of property- was bound to take out fresh Tapu papers, otherwise the sale could be declared null and void» This law was never properly enforced* 7 # As in 1iie case of the main Faddaghiyeh property (which was purchased at the same time) His Majesty' Government also at thetMme instructed Shaikh Mubarak to have the title deeds registered in the British Consulate i adding that, they His Majesty^ G-overnment would protect the property from an encroachment&lt;, 8. Unfortunately this last was not done, because of the difficulty of persuading a lady of Shafiqah^j standing to visit the British Consul and bear witness to the sale• i 9# During the early days of British occupation to be exact on 16th May 1915, a good opportunity presented itself cf having the origiml sale deeds, substituted for proper Tapu documents, and application was accordingly made to Mr # (later Sir Henry Dobbs) Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Basrah to this end. The 14th June 1915 was fixed for performing the transfer transaction, but Mr •Dobbs was unable to put the matter through because Shafiqah, had in the meantime fallen seriously ill# 10o Shortly afterwards Shafiqah after losing her two small sons Hassan and Abdul Baqi, died, and the matter of the Tapu papers remained in abeyance, an occurr ence not considered dangerous at the time, partly because the garden was a very small one, and partly because every one anticipated that the allies would win the war, and Iraq W qould become part of the British Umpire# See Political Agent, Kuwait's despatches No#99 of 25th June 1932 and 101 of E9th June to Bushire# —...... / ^4 11# Shafiqah left 5 dapghters all told, Rafiah, Bahiyah, Najiyah, Hamida and Kamila# 12# In August 1930 Eafiyah at the instance of her husband filed a suit against the Shaikh of Kuwait $Kuwait through Ms Agent in Basrah for 1/5 of the Bashiyeh property (her share) claiming that under article 36 of the Turkish Tapu Law, all sales which took place outside the Tapu Department were null and void. ^ 5 $ i 5 , 1 o 'Mr* I fi See Political Agent//£ Kuwaitis No#676 dated 16th ^September 1950 and Political Agent, Kuwait 1 s No # 32/l/747 dated 9tli October to the Hon f ble the Political Resident, 13# ^arly in 1931 the case was heard by the Basr^i Court and the Shaikh 1 s Agent in Basrah defended.

This was ; partly on the score of expense but mainly because he was i confident that his case was a good oneand that he would win f without difficulty. He unfortunately has little knowledge of legal matters, 22, The Shaikh contends that he has not received justice, for Hie following reasons:- if (a) The property like the Faddaghiyeh has been in the undisputed possession of his family for 23 years, or if we take up to the filing of the first suit 21-g: years# (b) That a British Judge twice gave a decree in Basrah in his favour, (c) That at bolii appeals in Baghdad the British President absented himselfo » II(a) That he, the Shaikh, had a right to expect the final appeal at any rate to be heard by a British Judge, seeing that he was an independent Ruler and under British protection# (e) Tliat to apply Article 31 of the old U Turksih Law in his case, was unjust and impro per. \ Lieut-Col., Political Agent, KuwaitIn the extreme Northern corner of the Paddaghiyeh, there are 3 very small properties, not shown on the sketch, which are owned by Baud al Faddagh, Abdullah al Rashaid, and ibn Mishri, respectively#Short History of the Shaildb. of Kuwait f s ^addaghiyeli** Property an the Shatt al Arab, from the time of purchase todate (1952) &gt; 1 # The property (Faddaghiyeh) is situated on the Shatt al Arab right bank, below Abadan and has approx# a 2 mile frontage• It is subdivided into various other properties as per sketch below, fhe total area being about 480 jeribs (including Bashiyeh and Waqf Gardens) o The property foms one of those exempted from payment of revenue under promise of His Majest^s Grovernment for services rendered during the great war.

He held a power of attorney from his wife at the time the sale was effected, and he promised that such power/ of attorney should be forwarded to Abdul Wahab Pasha al Qirlas, to enable 1he latter to appear before the Tapu Department, and declare the fi validity of the sale as was required by Law# Subsequently a power of attorney was sent but this, it is today said, was not &lt;&gt;he one signed—• If -2- !

' O I Dear Sir Prancis, I enclose the lengthy memorandum prepared \ by Alexander regarding the attempts which have 'been made to deprive the Shaikh of Ku?/ait of certain of his date .52 gardens. I enclose a copy of the letter asking him 52. for the information. You will remember that there were two cases, viz. (a) The Bashiyah garden case, the claim to l/lOth of which has already been admitted by the Courts in favour of one of the daughters of the original owner, and (b) The Pa.ddaghiyah case, said to be under preparation, regarding which no claim has yet been filed. The general conclusions reached by Alexander are that legally the Shaikh has no title to the Bashiyah garden, and he can suggest no steps whereby the Shaikh's interests therein can be safeguarded. He also expresses the opinion that if the Faddaghiyah ca,se comes to Court, the Shaikh ?\rill probably lose it. His enquiries do not support the suspicion that the 'Iraqi Government have any part in a conspiracy to oust the Shaikh from the properties. The Shaikh's difficulties arise solely from the fact that as he was notjan Ottoman subject, he could not obtain a clear legal title to these lands, and this is being taken advantage of by unscrupulous claimants, egged on, no doubt, by sharp lawyers. The fault in not having fRMJCIS HUMPHRYS,G.C.M.G.,G.C.V.O., K.B.E..C.I.I.having the case heard throughout 'by a British Judge seems to lie with the representative of the Shaikh in ! Iraq who seems at no time to have applied for the case to he heard 'by a British Judge. The memorandum and the causes themselves bristle with legal technicalities, and there do appear to be one or two legal points on which a skilled advocate might build up a case. For the present I can suggest no other course of action than to hold up all legal documents for service on the Shaikh here, until Hihill returns. In this way we can prevent any further legal steps being taken to the Shaikh^s disadvantage. Cases have been filed by the other three sisters of the successful plaintiff in the Bashiyah case and these documents are being held up. The reply to Alexander^ letter to the Minister asking for an enquiry into the reason why the appeal case was not specifically brought to his notice when it came up before the Court of Cassation, will be reported in due course. Sir Hubert Young, who arrives to-day, has not seen these papers 9 which I am sending by this mail in order that they may reach you by the end of the month. I will place them before him as soon as possible. The Shaikh of Kuwait has suggested that he should pay a private and personal visit to Baghdad to see the King, and the Political Resident hints that the question of his date gardens may be one of the forces which have prompted the request. The King has sent a reply welcoming the visit, which will be for two or three da.ys only, at the beginning of September. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)F .E .Stafford.Secretariat of H^lUthe High Commissioner for 'Iraq. D.0.6408. Bagjadad,the 1st Aug.1932. My dear Alexander, His Excellency the High Commissioner directs me to forward to you as Acting Adviser the enclosed copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 32 . w* Regarding difficulties which the Shaikh of Kuwait is encountering in connection with litigation arising out of his possession of landed properties in 'Iraq. His Excellency will be glad to receive as early as possible a general report on the case referred to, and, in particular, upon the following points (a) What is the law of limitation to 'be applied to these cases? ('b) A copy of the plaint and the defence in the second case regarding the Bashiyah lands. (c) How was it that the case was not 'brought to your notice especially in view of the fact that the original case was heard 'by you? (d) Whether in your opinion the Shaikh can successfully contest all these claims under the existing law or whether fresh legislation will 'be necessary? His Excellency desires to have the above report sent to him so as to reach him before the end of August if possible. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)P.E.Stafford. G.ALEXiilllER ESQ., CBE.20th August, 1932. MMORAKDDM. Subject (1) The Sheikh of Kuwait and the Bashiya Gaxden land suit. (2) The possession of the PadagMyah garden hy the Sheikh of Kuwait. With reference to your letter dated 1.8.1932 the Prime Einister and the Minister of Justice have both mentioned this matter to me and requested me to furnish all available information. 1 am therefore in a position to supply you with fuller comments than I would feel justified in doing if I acted only on the terms of Secretary of State letter dated 6th I , ebruary,192S. 2. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice realise that in your opinion the good name of the Law Courts is involved and at this stage of the political development of Iraq, the Government are particularly desirous that there should not be imputations against the law Courts and in particular against the Court of Cassation. 3. I must point out that I occupy the most peculiar position in this matter, for this report does not consist in my giving a note on the whole case only, but the honesty of the personnel of the Court of Cassation is directly challenged by the Sheiih of Kuwait and this aspect has been pressed by you upon me most forcibly, further you have put certain questions as regards the Sheikh's position in Law. I trust I may be able to give you full and accurate information on most of these matters but I cannot say what future decisions ought to be given by the courts because I shall D.-V.most certainly be required to sit. 4. The letter from Col.Dickson dated 25.6.32 / h shews2^ shews that the Sheikh of Kuwait owns 5 gardens or rather groups of gardens. The two gardens under reference in this matter are the Bashiya and the Jadaghiya gardens,these two gardens, with a third garden called Al Kharam, form the group of gardens called Fadaghiyah vide para# (9) of the letter. The case already decided affects the garden Bashiya and is in respect of a claim to one tenth of that garden 'being the share claimed by Rafia Bint Ali Pasha Al Zuhair. I have received information that three of the sisters of Rafia have now filed similar cases in the Court of First Instance Basrah, cases Hos.239, 214 and 253 and the Secretariat of the High Commissioner has been informed. The Sheikh of Kuwait alleged to Col.Dickson that a case is about to be filed in respect of the main Fadaghiyah garden but as regards this no information has reached me. 5. There is a point distinguishing the facts as regards the possession of the Sheikh in the Bashiya garden and the facts regarding his possession of the Fadaghiyah J* Hi* garden vide page (3) of the stitement of Abdul Aziz el Salim el Badar, agent for the Sheikh of Kuwait which is attached to Col.Dickson 1 s letter. This distinction is that no Tapu Sanad wa.s ever issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait in respect of the Bashiya garden but it appears that a Tapu Sanad was issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait in respect of the main Fadaghiyah garden vide the letter dated 14.6.1915 from Sir Henry Dobbs and statement on page (7) of Col .Dickson 1 s letiier. This distinction must be borne in mind when I deal with the Sheikh's possession as regards the Fadaghiyah garden. 6. I have no knowledge of the conditions under which the other four groups of gardens were bought by the Sheikh of Kuwait nor how the third garden Al Kharam of the Fadaghiyah group was acquired. 7. Without wishing to minimise the importance of the olieikh's allegations, the actual case decided affects one&gt;3 one tenth of the small garden of 31 jeribSand the Sheikh ! s main fear is as regards the large garden of A1 Fadaghiyah containing 400 jerihs# 8. As to the history of the proceedings up to the date of filing the action in the Basrah Court of First Instance in respect of the Bashiya garden, I see no reason not to accept the statement of Abdul Aziz el Salim el Badar set out on pages 1 &amp; 2 of the translation of his note and I agree with the statement on page 2 of the letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf dated 11.7»1932 that there is no doubt that it was a bona fide transaction and that the purchase price was paid* 9. I will now summarise the case and the findings. This will enable you to follow the complicated series of facts set out in this report. A.sues B.for a declaration of ownership in a piece of Miri lanr^d and for an injunction against B. Approves ownership of her ancestor. B.sets up sale dated 1327 i.e. 13th March 19^9 by a-ncestor of A.to ancestor of B.by means of ordinary unregistered sale deed. Held this Sanad cannot pass ownership; (a) It has not the consent of the Mamur Tapu necessary in 1327 under section 36 Land Law for Miri Land Sales. (b) The Transfer is not registered in Tapu and is therefore void vide Section 1. Transfer of Possession of Immovable Property Act 1329 and numerous decisions since Irada Saniyat 1318.

(1) Under Indian Limitation Act 12 years period under article 144 and he claims possession for more than 12 years prior to Repeal of that Act by Basrah Laws Repeal Act 1920. (2) Under article 20 Land Code, 10 years is sufficient. Held by court. Under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13.2.1909 (21st Muharram 1327) to 30.9.1920 Basrah Law Repeal Act i.e.ll years months. Further the court refused to hear witnesses that B.had possessed the land prior toto date of sale because the Sanad of Sale on which he himself relies state that the seller was in possession up to date of sale* Therefore Limitation has not run under the Indian Liraitation Act. Held secondly that although article 20 Land Code gives 10 years as period of prescription yet the principle of section 1674 of the Maj ell eh has to be followed namely that no pres cription runs if a party admits that his root of title is derived from the ancestor of the other party: in such case he cannot set up adverse possession but must establish a root of title such as a legal transfer. 10. The history of the proceedings in the Bashiya garden case has not in my opinion been accurately or sufficiently set out, I will therefore try to set out the salient facts.. A great deal ot stress has been laid by you and by Col. - Dickson on the judgment being given by Iraqi and not British judges and I have therefore made several references to this aspect of the case. 11. I have had copies made of the following documents and they have been sent to your office for translation and forwarding to you; 1.Judgment Court of First Instance dated 15.7.31. 2. Judgment Court of Cassation dated 11.11.31. 3.Judgment Court of First Instance dated 30.12.31. 4.Judgment Court of Cassation dated 9.5.32. 5.The petition filed by Rafia bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair dated 5.3.30. 6.The defence filed by the defendant dated 26.10.30. 7.A further defence dated 28.1.31. 8.A reply by the plaintiff dated 3.2.31. 9.A rejoinder by the defendant dated 12.2.31. 10.A statement by advocate for defendant dated 24.2.31. 11.Translation of a letter from Dafterkhana Constantinople to Wakil Dafterkhana Basrah, produced to court on 4.5.31 (probably 4.7.31). 12.Translation copy of a letter from Ministry of Tapu to Ministry of Finance signed by the Prime Minister produced on 4.5.31 (probably 4.7.31). 13.A letter from Mr.Dobbs da.ted 14th June, 1915. 14.An additional petition by the plaintiff dated 9.7.31. 12. In civil case llo.77 of 1930 of the Basrah Court of First Instance,Hafia bint Ali Pasha A1 Zuhair,sued Sheikh Ahmad Jabir A1 Sabah (Sheikh of Kuwait) . She claimed that she was the owner of one share out ofs f It ■ 2i {Jhj of ten of a certain garden in Fadagliiysli. This we know is the Bashiya garden. She alleged that defendant took possession and prevented her from obtaining her share, she set out her title which was 'based on Sanad Ehakani, that this was Miri land and any sale on such Miri la,nd must have a special authority from Mamur of Tapu vide section 36 of Land Law. She claimed an order to prevent interference with her en j oyment • Note That the nearest approach to this kind of relief in England Law is for' an injunction to restrain etc. The defence dated 26.10.1950 briefly denied that the Sheikh of Kuwait took the land by force and laid certain preliminary objections which were not important. On 28.1.1931 the main grounds of defence was filed. The defendant first queried the amount of the shares shewn to be in ownership of plaintiff. Ko point turns on this now and it was not raised in the Court of Appeal. It merely concerns whether the plaintiff inherited one tenth or inherited 17 out of 216 shares. The third ground sets out the case for the defendant namely that his grandfather Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah bought the shares I belonging to Shafiqa Khanim and her children Hassan,Bahija, I Uajiya, Rafia (the plaintiff in the case) and Kamila children I of Ali jPasha Al Zuhair for 3033 lira and 30 kurush on behalf of| her self as principal and as guardian (wasi) on behalf of the children, as proved by Sanad of sale dated 21st Muharram 1327. The defendant then referred to a condition of sale that if the business of Tafweedh i.e.transfer in Tapu were delayed,that delay would not form any ground to cancel the sale,he then stated that there was a delay in registering due to political matters because the Ottoman Government considered that the Sheikh of Kuwait had bought these lands for the benefit of the I British Government(sic) vide letter Ho.504 da/bed 14.6.1915 from Abdul Aziz Effendi el Salim el Badar,agent of defendant and for this reason the Government of Turkey sent a code telegram to Dafterkhana of Tapu Basra not to register. Note:Hote:I have set out this ground at a length because it con tains what is the real reason for the delay in registra tion. On 3.2.1951, plaintiff replied to this defence,the important points 'being the following (a) So far as the minor children were concerned, no permission was given by the Wadhi. Uote: I mention this because the formalities of the sale by the 'Wasi' are given as one of the grounds in the judgment of Court of First Instance Basrah dated 50#12.1931,but this point was not pressed in the Court of Appeal, which decided the case on other points• (b) Proved that this is Miri land and the sale of Mi^ri land without the permission of Mamur of Tapu was not allowed in 31327 under Article 36 of the Land Law. (c) That a sale outside Tapu must be registered under section 1 Law of Transfer of Possessions of Immovable Property Act* The defendant made a rejoinder to this dated 12.2•SI which adds nothing to the matter but on 24.2.31 he filed a petition giving the reasons why the sale was not registered in Tapu. He said that this was not done because the Turkish Government wanted a declaration that the Sheikh of Kuwait Y/as a Turkish subject whereas he is independent under the protection of Britain. On the 4th of May 1931 (probably an error for 4•7.31) defendant put in letter from Dafterkhana 1st ana to Dafterkhana Basra ordering him to do the registration on the lines of the communication from the Prime Minister.He also filed a translation of letter from. Prime Minister Mahmud |i Shawkat Pasha to Ministry of Finance Istana ordering it to carry through the business of Sheikh of Muhammera and that of the Qaimmaqam of Kuwait if they admit that they were Turkish subjects and agree to have this endorsed in the Sanads# During the hearing on 9.7.31 the plaintiff filed an argument in writing which recapitulates the points on which he relies. 13. I have set out at length the points made by plaintiff and defendant because at the rehearing no additional pleadings were filed and the case proceeded on these original proceedings and on the arguments recorded in the 'dhabt' i.e. record of the case. You will notice ■i2; will notice that there does not appeax to 'be raised the matter of limitation on which you have laid so much stress hut in fact in the second hearing this point was expressly raised and recorded in the 'dhabt' and formed the main grounds of appeal taken in the second appeal. 14. At this stage I will set out the dates of the different decisions. They are: 14.4•31 claim dismissed by Mr.Hooper for lack of prosecution. This is a very ordinary step in a case and I see no reason to comment on the remarks of the defendants agent to the effect that at that date i.e.before judgment,Mr. Hooper was convinced of the justice of defendant 1 scase and for that reason plaintiff withdrew her power of attorney from her advocate and allowed the case to be dismissed for default. If Mr.Hooper really was unwise enough to shew his intentions before giving final judgment,it is quite understandable why the plaintiff dropped the case but I really have no grounds on-which to say that this was the reason why the plaintiff dropped the case. There may be a dozen reasons. On 6.5.31 the plaintiff applied to continue the case by oioposition to the judgment of dismissal .The case was heard on the 7th of July 1931 by the Vice-president and the judgmertj was given on 15.7.1931, in favour of the defendant i.e.of the Sheikh of Kuwait dismissing the case on the ground that an action must firstly be filed to cancel the deed of sale of the 21st Muharram before any action could be filed based on ownership claiming mana ! mu'aradha.So far as the allegation of the Sheikh of Kuwait against the bona fides of the Iraqi judges is concerned, Icannot see that he can complain of this judgment in his favour but I now draw your attenuion to fact that although Mr .Hooper was known to be leaving Basrah f no application was made to me as President Court of Cassation by Mohammed Sffendi Wasfi,the Sheikh's advocate^,to transfer the case to another court.If the Sheikh's agent had then- 8 - then any reason to suspect an intrigue either with lawyers or with Government officials I find it difficult not to suppose that he would have gone to the British Consul and information brought to me or after I went on leave to Mr. Drower who acted t for me. i 15. I attach copy of Judgment of the Civil Court of Plrst Instance Basrah which I paraphrase as follows: 'The defendant relies on a contract of sale which purports to 'transfer ownership to him. The plaintiff relies on 'inheritance through the person who made the Sanad of sale. Therefore the plaintiff cannot claim ownership until he has i '■cancelled the sale, she must therefore first file an action 'to cancel the Sanad. If that succeeds, she may then claim in j 'respect of the share of the estate which she has inherited 'as the owner and may then file an action claiming (Mana' 'mua'radha) i.e. prevent the defendant from interfering with 'her property'. For the benefit of any lawyer who may be consulted I should explain that this is what the Turks call a judgment on a preliminary ground. Such judgments caused much scandalous delay and section 20 of the amended Civil Procedure Regulation was flamed to curtail these judgments on i preliminary points, but, unfortunately it left it to the discretion of the court and this case is an instance of the trouble which results when a judge does not give judgment on I the merits as well as on prelimtna-y objections. 16. Against this judgment an appeal was filed before the Court of Appeal C.A.148 of 1931. plaintiff appellant: (a) challenged thejcorrectness of the order of dismissal, (b; referred to section 36 of the Land Law and the judgment | of the Court of Cassation of Constantinople dated 13/1/3.331 with reference to the sale made outside Tapu by the Sanad of ! 21st Kuharram 1327 relied on by defendent respondent. I (c)(o) Urged tiiat the sale of liiie minor' property without leave of the ^adhi is valid. The advocate for defendant respondent maintained that the decision was correct and he also claimed that in view of the long possession of this land the Law of limitation applies. I was present at the hearing of this appeal. A fairly- complete note was prepared for me and I concurred with the judges. In this judgment the court held that the decision to reject the claim on the single ground that the plaintiff must first file an action to cancel the deed of sale is wrong, in particular as it will appear clear that this deed is null and void as a transfer of property being made outside Tapu vide sec. 1 Immovable Property Act and without permission 4 of the Mamur as required under section 36 of the Lena law and as this transaction was not one merely Toidahle but is actually null and void, no separate action to cancel it is required before the court can treat it as being non-existent. The case was therefore remitted for re-hearing on its merits. ^ As this decision was given by Turkish trained judges and is flamed in language which presupposes that the decision is a technical document for lawyers,the following observations will assist you in realising what is the theory of Turkish law regarding unregistered sale of Miri land in areas where the Tapu offices function • In Turkey there is a difference 'between transfer of mulk (firagh) and transfer of miri (tafweedh). In Miri lands there is always an ultimate ownership in Govt, which may be resumed and section 36 of the land law preserved the right of Government to interfere with the free disposal of such Miri land by insisting that ohe permission of Ma'mur concerned i.e. I the Tapu Ma'mur should be obtained. Further such transfer is legally effected in the Tapu Office only, therefore, unless and l until, a transaction affecting Miri land was registered in Tapu and the conspnt • consent obtained, usually by endorsement Of i^vv'wvv v Jo of the Mamur Tapu, that transaction was null and void in the year 1327 and in the eyes of the law did not exist to pass property. The consent of the Ivfemur Tapu does not appear to be necessary any longer since 1329 but that doe not concern the efforts to register this sale. 17. Before going on with the proceedings I will say a word as to why the Tapu Mamur refused to give his consent. The law of the Ottomans is not in favour of immovable property being held by foreigners. Even in the case of Mulk land e.g.houses and small gardens it is only allowed on condition taat the foreigner submitted to the laws and courts of the country and as regards Miri land it was forbidden. The Turkish attituae in this matter throughout has been that no sale to foreignerswill be allowed and the Government Mamur was forbidden to allow this transfer. Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a point as regards the known attitude of the Sheikhs of Muhammara and Kuwait towards the Turkish State and offered to allow them to register their sale if they admitted that they were Turkish subjeots# 18. The Court of Appeal disposed of the first appeal on the 9th of November 1931,and papers went back to Basrah and on the 14th. of December the Iraqi Vice- president fixed the 23rd of December for the re -hearing. Since the proceedings in this part of the case have been attacked because no British Judge sat. I must point out tnat Mr. Idoyd was President of the Basrah Court and was in Basrah from 1st of December. All British judges toow that they should sit if possible in foreigners eases and I cannot believe that any application was made to3/ to Mr. Lloyd to sit in this case and must therefore presume that the advocate Muhammad Wasfi Effendi and Abdul Aziz Effendi A1 Salim Al Badar took no steps to draw the attention of the British President to the case. I have read the rf dhabt rT and it is quite clear that the following points were raised in argument by the Sheildi of Kuwait 1 s advocate. (a) That in this case limitation ought to run under section 144 schedule 1 the Indian Limitation Act and that the period has elapsed. (b) If the Indian Limitation Act does not apply, limitation runs under the Law of the country and also has elapsed. On 30th December 1931 judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff on the following grounds (a) That the sale as shewn by the deed of 21st. Muharram 1327 was null and void under section 1 Possession of Land Law. (b) Section 1674 of the Majelle lays down that in view of the admission of the right of the plaintiff T s ancestor no prescription can be pleaded. Hote: This is the important decision as to limitation and will be discussed late on. (c) That at any event a sale by one fI Wasi rT will be invalid. 19. On this judgment appeal is made to the Court of Appeal; 2nd, appeal Ho. 66/932. Iskender Mansour Effendi appeared for the Sheikh as appellant, 'it is alleged that I was delibeiafcaly kept in ignorance of this case. Iskender Mansour is an advocate who often comes to Baghdad on appellate work and is quite well aware that he Eiay at any time have access to the President if he wishes to apply to him. He made no effort to secure my presence in the case. The cases was heard on the 9th May. There were 5 cases in the list including one concerning a foreigner3&lt;v foreigner on which I s^t. The parties in the appeal by the Sheikh of Kuwait were described: Appellant: A1 Sheikh Ahmad A1 Sabah, Advocate Iskender Effendi Man Pour. Hespondent: Hafia bint Ali Zuhair, her advocate Kamal Effendi A1 ^inawi, I note that you apprehend that this omission to inform me that it was a foreigners case was intentional. In view of the extremely sharp nature of your conjectures I have asked the Minister to hold special encjuiry vide my letter to the Minister dated 16.8.32. copy attached. I will only observe that the grounds of appeal filed by Iskender Mansour do not state that the Appellant was the Sheikh of Kuwait nor does the copy of the judgment of the First Instance filed with those grounds state that but the Sheikh is described by the title of His Highness and the advocate T s Power of Attorney state that he was the Hule r of Kuwait. 20. The judgment of the Court of Cassation sets out the grounds of appeal fully. They are as follows:- (a) Limitation in this case should be in accordance with para. 144 Schedule 1 of Indian Limitation Act, that the period under this is 12 years, and that 12 years of actual possession had passed before Basrah Law Repeal Act of 1920 took effect and appellant claims to prove this by proving possession before the sale deed was made. (b) If Limitation under the Indian limitation Act is not good then the Appellant has been in possession for the necessary period under the law of the country and section 20 of the land Code applies which gives prescription of 10 years. (c) Appellant has enjoyed this possession by virtue of a legal sale not in opposition to the v /ishes of the seller. Although the sale by the one 'Wasi' yet it was33 was with permission of the qadhi and if the court cancels sale I asic for the recovery of the price. The plaintiff respondent took the points already discussed in the law Court and in particular laid emphasis on section 1674nof the Majelle claiming that once an admission of the right of plaintiff's ancestor had been made a defence of limitation cannot succeed and he also relied on section 1 of the Transfer of Immovable Property law. As to Limitation under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13-E-1909 to 30th Sept. 1920 i.e. eleven years seven months and a half. The defendant appellant submitted a further statement of grounds of appeal of which the important points arei- (a) The possession exceeded 12 years under the Indian Limitation Act. (b) That the Qadhi had given valid permission. (c) That no permission of Mamur Tapu was required. The judgment of the Court of Cassation holds that:- (a) In as much as the Sanad of sale stated that possession of the seller continued up to the date of sale, the possession of the buyer for the purpose of Limitation runs xrom the date of the Sanad i.e. 21st Muharram 1327 and that 12 years has not expired under the Indian Limitation Act before the Basrah Law Hepeal Act. (b) Under the Law of the country the admission of a right to titled entirely prevents a subsequent setting up of Limitation under section 1674 of the Majelle. (c) The sale deed is null and void. I have examined the points of limitation under the Majelle i.e. Law of the country, ana thae is ample authority from the remarks of Ali Haidar the Jurist that if a defendant admits that the origin of his possession has derived from34 - 14 - from the plaintiff or his ancestor the defendant cannot plead prescription hut must prove some other means of acquisition e.g. sale. In this case he tried to prove such sale but as the sale was unregistered he cannot rely on this as a transfer of property; as long ago as 1318 all such transactions outside Tapu were forbidden regarding Mulk and Miri land by Iradah Saniyah. 21. I come now to answer your specific questions: As to limit ation ; I have set out the view taken by tne Court of Cassation a.nd I see no reason to suppose it is wrong except that the view that possession under the Indian Limitation Act only runs from the date of the / •/ Sanad is a point on which I am a little doubtful; There is, however, much to be said for the view followed by the Court of Cassation that the written admission in the Sanad of sale as to possession commencing with the date of the Sanad is conclusive against the purchaser even though the Sanad itself as a disposition of property is null and void. A reference to the Sanad shews that it contains admission that the land is under the possession of seller up to the date of the Sanad and will be possessed by the sheikh of Kuwait. t 13 ) As to copy of plaint I have a i ready gtated that in the re-hearing at Basra separate written pleadings were not filed but that the 'dhabt' a court record shews clearly that the point of limitation was argued. I have supplied copies of all the pleadings. (c) I have explained how 1 did not cane to sit in this case. (d) See next paragraph. Your question (d) presumably refers to the two gardens Bashiya and Padaghiyah. I do not see what the Sheikh can do to contest the decision already given as- 15 - regards the claims of Rafia to l/10th of the Bashiya garden, but if he wishes to apply for a review the grounds are well known vide section 27 of the Amended Civil Procedure Regulations. Clearly I cannot possible advise to his chance of success. As regards the J^adaghiyah garden I remind you of the distinction between this garden and the Bashiya garden; namely, that it appears from the letter of Sir nenry Dobbs dated 14th of June 1915 that a Sanad Khakani has been issued to the Sheikh of Kuwait. If an action is filed as regards the Fadaghiyah garden the following points will certainly arise; (a) Is the Sanad Khakani a valid disposition in -Tapu ? (b) If Valid so far as the Government is concerned was it made with the consent of the seller or her heirs ? (c) If there were minors with interests in the garden when does the period of prescription cease. I will here observe that Sir Henry Dobbs' letter shews that the entry in the register was made without the consent of the heirs of the sellers. Under Turkish law it is possible to file suit to declare void a transaction in Tapu and the point will be taken that it is essential that in such transactions the seller or his agent must be present and admit the sale. As regards prescription for such suit I am unable to say how far prescription may run as the claimant appears to have been a minor at the time of the sale. If a minor the period of minority must be added to the period of prescription which I am informed is 15 years. In answer to your question I can therefore say that it is doubtful whether the Sheikh can successfully contest the claim, assuming the period of prescription is not completed. 23- As regards legislation, this depends on the general- 16 - 3&lt; conditions surrounding this case. In this matter the Iraq Goyernment stands in the shoes of the Turkish Government. The same objection to foreigners holding Miri land prevails. The Turkish view confirmed toy the courts was that this transaction is null and void tout the Msmur of Tapu would, on toehalf of the Government, allow registration, as the sellers agreed, on condition that the purchaser declare himself to toe a Turkish sutoject. I do not see that any political consideration can possitoly destroy the legal results of such failure to regi ster. The Law as to limitation laid down under section 1674 of the Majelle is peculiar to English ideas tout to me it seems logical. There have toeen many different decisions as regards necessity or non-necessity of registering land in different parts of Iraq tout I am of the opinion that as far as the transactions in land at Basra is concerned section 36 of the Land Law certainly applied as to permission of Mamur Tapu and since the Irada Saniyah of 1318 there have toeen many decisions insisting that sales must toe registered or they have no validity. The first part of section 1 of Law to dispose of Immovatole Property 1329 lays this down and applies in Iraq according to many decisions. The Unregistered Sales Confirmation Proclamation 1919 affirms this in its Preamtole. 24. Generally I am of the opinion that, even if the omission to inform me of the case, was intentional, the grounds given toy the Court of Cassation will toe accepted toy the Iraq Government as toeing valid grounds for determining this claim and unless there is seme treaty otoligation I do not think that the IraqGovernment will admit any liability. The argument may be expressed as follows:- Minor children are not bound until they reach majority. They may take any legal steps to recover what they think is their patrimony. The sale by ancestor of plaintiff is null and void. If there is a legal flaw in the title of the purchaser from their father and mother they may recover the estate even though it has enormously increased in value unless they are time barred. They were not time barred at the date of the Basrah Law Repeal Act and under the Civil Law no prescription can be good as the Sheikh admitted he held his titles from the ancestor of Plaintiff, I will put the matter in another way. The Sheikh of Kuwait ha,s induced the British Government to guarantee his possession of lands to which he cannot (presumably) establish his legal title. I draw attention to the following:- It is in fact clear from the conditions of the deed that he was aware of the necessity of registration and aware that there were difficulties he endeavoured against the express provisions of the Law to ensure that the sale should not be considered null. 25. As to the premise by the British Government, the Iraq Government, so you inform me, donU admit this promise to be binding on the IraQ Government. If there is a dispute between the two Governments, presumably the matter will go to the Hague Court. If the Hague Court holds that this is an international obligation of Iraq, then, the Iraq Government may have to pass a law expropriating those persons who establish their claims in those gardens. If the Hague Court holds that there is no internationaln - 18 - obligation on the Iraq GoTernment it seems to me that this becomes a matter between the .British Government and the Sheikh of Kuwait and it is for the British Government to decide whether the Sheikh should be compensated. 26. I notice that the Sheikh of Kuwait refuses to employ Mr.Mirza Mohammed. It will be extremely difficult for the High Commissioner to get legal opinion unless seme advocate of standing is employed and I am of the opinion that it is advisable to obtain the advice of an experienced local advocate. It may be that the ruling on limitation under the Indian Limitation Act can be attacked and the ruling that article 20 of the Land Code is subject to the overriding provisions of article 1674 of the Majelle may be challenged by the advocate. 27. The Political Resident of the Gulf asi® about the claim to be independent of the Law Courts. All I can say is that the Sheikh of Kuwait can raise this point in the 3 cases filed at Basrah. When a foreign potentate possess^ land in another country it is easy to believe that the court will not admit that an action affecting immovable property can be excluded from their jurisdiction. ^ ie Court gave no order regarding the point raised on appeal tha/t a refund of the purchase price should be claimed. There is nothing to prevent the Sheikh claiming to recover this. Ho doubt the court did not decide this as it would mean an adjournment for payment of the court fees on the claim. 29. The court did not go into the point whether the second guardian should have joined in the sale. There may be a good deal of substance in the argument that when there are two 'Wasis' both must join, failing which a disposition by one can be upset. 30. I cannot recommend any legislation except to- 19 - alter the application of the Majelle, to possession of land under article 20 of the Land Code. 31. Finally do not let it be supposed that I am in favour of the present Civil Code known as the Majelle nor of the provisions of the Land Code. I have frequently pressed for the revision of both the Majelle and Land Code and you will find my comments in my annual reports especially for 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1931, copies of which should be in your office. (Sgd.) G. Alexander, a/G Judicial Adviser. #LfO KZJ H.E. the Minister, I have received, as Acting Adviser, a letter from the High Commissioner on the subject of a case from the Basra Court of First Instance No. Appeal case Ho._ of 1932. In this appeal which concerns a foreigner, the Shaikh of Kuwait, I did not sit. The orders on the matter of foreign cases to my office are that I should be informed of every case in which a foreigner is a party. I am aware that the Shaikh of Kuwait has informed the British Political Resident of the Gulf that the absence of a British Judge in the hearing before the Court of Appeal was not by accident but was done deliberately. The High Commissioner personally drew my attention to this aspect of the case and asked me for my reasons for not sitting. It is also alleged that the case of Plaintiff against the Shaikh is a case maintained by certain advocates in Basra. In matters of Discipline the Ministry of Justice exercise the functions of a Head of Department under the State Officials Disciplinary Law. The practice of the Court is for the day f s list to be placed in front of me. In the list for Monday 7th May 1932, there was one foreigner 1 s case noted in the usual manner but the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait was not mentioned nor is the title Shaikh inserted nor anything to indicate the rank of Appellant. I attach a certified copy of that list. As President to the Court of Cassation, I therefore request that you will cause enquiry to be made and suggest in particular that it be decided whether clerk Human -iffendi or the Head Clerk was negligent and to what degree or is there any evidence to show there was deliberate intent to deceive the President. 16th August 1932.THE OTTOMAN CODS OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.

'he Secretary of State understands that under the application by the itoglish Courts of the principles of international law a Sovereign is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Courts in this country, and that in the case of the Duff Development oorapany v. the Sultan of Kelantan the House of Lords held that the oultan, as being a ruling prince, was not amenable to the courts. In Indian law the conditions under which action may be taken in the courts either by or against a Sovereign, or a Ruling Chief in subordinate alliance with the British Crown, are severely restricted. Che Secretary of tate is not aware of the relevant provisions of the Iraq law; but on the assumption that the Sheikh must be recognised as a sovereign ruler prima ■fesla it would appear doubtful whether a claim such as the present can properly be prosecuted in the Iraq Courts; and in view of the possible importance of the point so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, he would suggest that the position in this respect should be investigated.

They then asked me how it was that I did not know the boundaries seeing that I was the Agent, and I replied to than that I was the agent for tilling the land and loading the dates (on dhows) only, and that I knew nothing besides that. After these questions they produced a blank paper and asked me to sign it, this I refused to do. They insisted that I must sign, but I said that there was no compulsion for me to sign, as there was an official Agent in Basrah who was Abdul Aziz as-Salim.

Stafford to Sir Francis Humphrys, with enclosure^ on the subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait's title to ♦•Bashiyeh** and ^Faddaghiyeh 11 date gardens. Without being a legal expert the following comments occur to me. 2. Mr. Stafford in his letter to Sir Francis Humphrys sums up Mr. Alexander's conclusions as follows! * The general conclusions reached by Alexander are that legally the Shaikh ll has no title to the Bashiyeh garden, and he can suggest no steps whereby the Shaikh 's interests therein can be safe guarded. He also expressed the opinion that if the Faddaghiyeh case comes to Court, the Shaikh will probably lose it'. As Mr, Stafford points out the cases themselves bristle with legal technicalities. However, Mr. Alexander's note is of great assistance towards grasping the essentials of a complicated matter.~2~ w Bashiyeh M cage* 3. From Mr. Alexandor's note the history of the case appears to be as follows*- Paragraph 12 of Mr.Alexander's note . On the 5th March 1930 the case was filed in the Basrah Court of First Instance by Rafia bint All Pasha A1 auhair (the plaintiff) against the Shaikh of Kuwait. On the 14th April 1931 the claim was dismissed by Mr. Hooper, Judge of the Basrah Court, for lack of prosecu tion. On the 6th May 1931 the plaintiff applied to continue the case by opposition to the judgment of dismissal. The case was heard on the 7th of July 19-51 by the Vice- President of the Basrah Court, and Judgment was given on 15th July 1931 in favour of the defendent.i.e., of the Shaikh of Kuwait, dismissing the case on the ground that an action must first be filed to cancel the deed of sale of the 21st Uuharram 1327 (13th February 1909) before any action could be filed based on ownership claiming mana* mu 1 aradha. Paragraphs 16-18 of Mr.Alexander's note . Against this judgment an appeal was filed before the Court of Appeal,(C.A,148 of 1931). The Court of Appeal disposed of the first appeal on the 9th November 1931, papers went back to Basrah and on 14th Jecember 1931 the •Iraqi Vice-President fixed the 23rd December for the re hearing. On the 30th December 1931 judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff on the following groundss \ (a) That the sale as shown by the deed of ■\ ■ 21st Muharram 1327 was null and void under section l.Possessior of Land Law. ■ ' y . 1 v (b) Section 1674 of the Majelle lays down tha\ •«•mmm -3- that in Tiew of the admission of the right of the plaintiff 1 s ancestor no prescription can be pleaded. i/n* (c) That any event a sale by one ^Wasi' will be inval id* Paragraph 19 of ^♦Alexander* 8 nute . On this judgment appeal is made to the Court of Appeal by the Shaikh. Paragraph 20 of Mr.Alexander * s note # The judgment of the Court of Cassation is as foil owss (a) In as much as the 3anad of Sale stated that 1 I possession of the seller continued up to the date of sale, the I possession of the buyer for the purpose of Limitation runs from the date of the Sanad, i.e., 21st Muharram 1327 and that 12 years \ n has not expired under the Indian Limitation Act before the Basrah Law Repeal Act. T (b) Under the Law of the country the admission of a right to title entirely prevents a subsequent setting up of Limitation under section 1674 of the Majelle# (c) The sale deed is null and void. 4. As Mr. Alexander points out (paragraph 5 of his note) there is a distinguishing point between the case of the Bashiyeh ^ garden and that of the Faddaghiyeh gardem in the former no Tapu Sanad was ever issued to the Shaikh of Kuwait, in the latter a Tapu Sanad was issued. i^he reason for the Shaikh not applying for the Sanad in the case of the Bashiyeh garden i# given in H. ^ paragraph 12 of Mr. Alexander's note, in which he states: ' The ■' • ' ' ; I \v 'V defendent then referred to a condition of sale that if the business of Tafweedh, i.e., transfer in Tapu were delayed, tha^ delay would not form any ground to cancel the sale, he then stated that j there was a delay in registering due to political matters because ' : '.!ybecause the Ottoman Government considered that the Shaikh of Kuwait had bought these lands for the benefit of the British GrOTernment (sic) vide letter So#504 dated 14th June 1915 from Abdul Aziz Effendi el Salim el Badar, agent of defendant and for this reason the Government of Turkey sent a code telegram to Bafterkhana of Tapu Basrah not to register# ^ w 0n the 12th February 1951 the defendant made a rejoinder which adds nothing to the matter, but on 24th February 1931 he filed a petition giving the reasons why the sale was not registered in fapu# He said that this was not done bea&amp;use the Turkish Government wanted a declaration that the Shaikh of Kuwait was a Turkish subject whereas he is independent under the protection of Britain 1 * • Further, in paragraph 17 of his note, Mr. Alexander states* '♦Before going on with the proceedings I will say a word as to why the Tapu Maaur refused to give his consent* the Law of the Ottomans is not in favour of immovable property being held by foreigners# Kven in the case of Mulk land,e»g# houses and small gardens it is only allowed on condition that the foreigner submitted to the laws and courts of the country and as regards Miri land it was forbidden# The Turkish attitude in this matter throughout has been that no sale to foreigners will be allowed and the Government Mamur was forbidden to allow this transfer# Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a point as regards the known attitude of the Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Kuwait towards the Turkish State and offered to allow them to register their sale if they admitted that they were Turkish subjects 11 #''' ' -— -5- 5, There are of course certain points in favour of the Shaikh, though they have been overruled in the Courts. One is that in the case of the Bashiyeh garden, as Mr. Alexander points out (paragraph 8), there is no doubt that its purchase by the Shaikh was a bona fide transaction and that the purchase price was paid. The grounds on which the Shaikh seeks to rebut the claim of the plaintiff ares *(l) Under the Indian Limitation Act. # (2) Under Article 20 of the Land Act, * Paragraph 9 of Mr.Alexander 1 s note. Under the former the Shaikh, by the decision of the Court, is only # months short of the necessary time (12 yef rs). The Coujbt refused to hear witnesses that the Shaikh had possessed the land prior to the date of its sale, on the grounds that the sanad of Sale on which he himself relied stated that the seller was in possession up to the date of the sale. Presum ably the Shaikh can produce witnesses to prove actual possess ion before the date mentioned in the Sanad of Sale, and Mr. Alexander (paragraph 21 (a) ) is doubtful as to whether possession under the Indian Limitation Act only runs from the date of the Sanad# He is of opinion (paragraph 26 ) that both that ruling, and the ruling that Article 20 of the Land Code is subject to the overriding provisions of the Majelle Law, might be challenged. Prima facie it would seem to me that both these rulings might well be challenged# 6. With regard to there being no British judge on the tribunals which tried the case, Mr. Alexander sayss ^ I must point out that Mr. Lloyd was President of the Basrah Court and was in Basrah from 1st of December. All British judges know that they should sit if possible in foreigners' oases and ..... i miiinii rumnmrM -6- * and I cannot believe that any application was made to Mr. Lloyd to sit in this case and must therefore presume that the advocate Muhammad W&amp;sfi Effendi and Abdul Aziz Bffendi A1 Salim ; A1 Badar took no steps to draw the attention of the British | President to the ease' (paragraph 18 of Mr.Alexander's note). Further in paragraph 19 he saysi 'It ia alleged that I was deliberately kept in ignorance of this case. Iskender Mansour is an advocate who often comes to Baghdad on appellate work j and is quite well aware that he may at any time have access to the President if he wishes to apply to him. he made no effort to secure my presence in the case. The cases were heard on the 9th May. There were 5 cases in the list including one S ■ concerning a foreigner on which I sat# I'he parties in the appeal by the Shaikh of Kuwait were described? Appellantt Al Shaikh Almad Al 3abail, | Advocate Iskender Effendi Mansour. !i Respondents aafia bint Ali ..uhair, her advocate Kamal Effendi Al Sinawi. I note that you apprehend that this omission to inform me that j it was a foreigner's case was intentional. In view of the extremely sharp nature of your conjectures I have asked the Minister to hold special enquiry vide my letter to the Minister j K dated 16th August 19S2, copy attached. 1 will only observe } f that the grounds of appeal filed by Iskender Mansour do not state that the Appellant was the Shaikh of Kuwait nor does the copy of the judgment of the jfirst Instance filed with those grounds state that but the Shaikh is described by the title of His Hi^iness and the advocate's Power of Attorney ■ state that he was the Ruler of Kuwait.' In his communication j to His Excellency the Minister (presumably the Minister for ■i ' the Interior) he states 'The practice osf the Court is for the day's list to be placed in front of me. In the list for Monday ■uyu ^ 'w♦♦Monday Itla May 1932, there was one foreigner's case noted in the usual manner but the ease of the Shaikh of Kuwait was not mentioned n®r is the title Shaikh inserted nor anything to indicate the rank of Appellant'. It would appear from the aboTe,therefore t that as far as the Basrah proceedings were concerned the fault lay with the Shaikh 1 s advocate, who took no steps to draw the attention of the British President to the case # In the proceedings at Baghdad the Shaikh's adTocate, who was not one of those employed at Basrah, displayed similar negligence - either lay inadvertence or on purposei and this negligence by the advocates concerned of the interests of their client hardly reflects credit on the 1 Iraq bar. It also appears from the communica tion to the Minister, quoted above, that the Court clerks failed to bring the particular case to Mr•Alexander's notice, and it is significant that the title of the Shaikh was suppressed• '^adda^hiyeh' case . 7, Mr. Alexander's general opinion on the Faddaghiyeh case is given in paragraph 22 of his note. Briefly it is as follows. It appears from the letter of Sir Henry Dobts dated 14th June 1915 that a Sanad Khakani was issued to the Shaikh of Kuwait in respect of the above garden. But the registration was made without the consent of the heirs of the sellers# Mr, Alexander points outs 'I will here observe that Sir Henry Dobbs' letter shows that the entry in the register was made without the consent of the heirs of the sellers. Under Turkish Law it is possible to file suit to declare void a transaction in Tapu and the point will be taken that it is essential that in such transactions the seller or his agent must be present and admit the sale'. With ....-8- ^ I fitli regaxd to the first point. Further on in the same paragraph Mr. Alexander states that the claimant appears to bare been a minor at the time of the sale# If so then /' ! i prima facie she could have no say in the sale as a minor. To take an example. Supposing ♦•A^jWho has a minor son 4 years old, sells property to it is surely unreasonable to suppose that 'A* must get the consent of his son and heir before the sale is effected, or that the son 15 or 20 years afterwards can institute a claim against because at the time of the sale he (the son) was not consulted by his father. But perhaps I hare misunderstood Mr. Alexander's comments i on this point. With regard to the second point, the absence of the seller or his agent at the time of the sale would appear to be breach of a minor legal technicality, since the seller was of course well aware that the sale had been effected, and if he had any objection could have lodged it. i. am sending copies of this letter to liis Majesty's * Secretary of State for India and His Majesty's Minister, * Baghdad. *sent under P.L# 1 have the honour to be, No.825-S of 31st October 1932. sir » Your most obedient servant. f/t Lt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian tfulf, ui Ak Copy forwarded to the Political Agent, Kuwait, for information.

Sir Francis explained that there had been a test case in respect of a portion of one very small garden; this case the Shaikh had lost. Another case was pending in respect of a larger property. At present a deadlock had been produced, because the Shaikh had withdrawn his power of attorney from his Agent in Basrah, which prevented the Courts from taking action, since the Political Resident would not serve the writs on the Shaikh of Kuwait. 26. Mr» Beckett thought that the 1914 undertaking had been meant to safeguard the Shaikh from precisely the kind of legal action which was now being taken against him. It had been suggested that the Shaikh was not amenable to the Iraq courts by reason of his sovereign status, but Mr, Beckett explained that in the first place it seemed too late to base any case on such a claim at this stage, since the Shaikh had already appeared as a party to legal proceedings and had thereby waived any immunity which he might have had. Moreover authorities on international law were sharply divided as to the degree of immunity from the local courts conferred by sovereign status as regards questions relating to the owner ship of land.-2- 27. It was generally agreed that if the Shaikh were dis possessed of any of his gardens he would have a claim for com pensation against His Majesty^ Government.

The Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h j, r e. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that acting on my advice apparently^His S&amp;cellency the Shaikh has appointed Messrs. Yacub and Artin, two lawyers of Basrah to represent him in future in all matters connected with his properties in Iraq. 2. I had^ heard that His Excellency had come -to this decision sometime ago, and before your recent visit to Kuwait, but I only received confirmation of this fact from His Excellency personally yesterday (24th January 1933). 3. As far as I can gather both the gentlemen bear fairly good reputation?, and are considered to be the best that Basrah can produce. 4. It is significant that both Messrs. Yacub and Artin conducted and won the case against the Shaikh in the recent n Bashiyeh M proceedings. They have now apparently withdrawn from the w Bashiyeh w case altogether, and have taken service on the side of their late adversary. Under the terms however of their new agreement with the Shaikh, I understand that they will take no 'sides' at all, should further developments occur in the 'Bashiyeh' case. Tfiis after all is only proper.As regards the suit recently filed against the Shaikh in the matter of the Faddaghiyeh case, His Excellency tells me that there are no further developments at all, and that his having won over the advocates who were to have appeared for the oth 002 side, appears to hav^ had a useful effect# definite, it would appear as if there was something in my original suppositlion and the Shaikh's belief that the whole / unsavoury 'business was worked up by certain Basrah lawyers with the object of making money out of the Shaikh, and that having got some of the principal actors on h^s side, the Shaikh has for the time being at any rate left the other side ^guessing'. 7 # I understand that Messrs. Yacub and Art in get a monthly salary, irrespective of results, a useful way of adding to their income. 8« The above is forwarded for information only.

Of course you realize that one of ray chief anxieties at the present time is the Shaikh's attitude of Bind towards His Majes^s Government. He has I fear lost much faith to us British, not only in the matter of the gardens question, but because no relief has been secured to him by His Ma jest's Oorernraaat frora Bin saud*® Blockade, to spite of our pronise made to 1929. fhe Shaikh is tod&amp;y faced having to decide whether to gire en Oil Concession to the iinglo-Peraian Oil Company or the i&amp;tericsn group represent ed by Holmes. It is of paramount importance that he should decide in the right direction, of course, but he feels so bitterly tfiat he has been let down over the date gardens and Blockade business, that erne cannot but help see that Aght Lieutenant l .J'.Howes, K.C., Special Service Officer, Basrah.that the scales are already ta large taeasuro weighted in favour of the Baatern aad Owseral ^yadioate.

As stated in Captain Gastrell's letter I entirely concur with His excellency the Ambassador in welcoming any dela^y in the suit in question being brought into Court# In his despatch $0.43 (159/2/33) of 19th January 1933 to the Foreign Office His i^ccell .ncy detailed certain courses of actiom 11) inducing the Iraqi Ctovernment to pass special legislation deciding that tne Tapu deed of registration for Shakh Ahmad*s Faddaghiyeh garden granted by Sir Henry Dobbs was in all respects valid, 12) inducing the plaintiff to settle the case out of Court, (5) a claim of immunity for the Shaikh from process in the civil courts oi Iraq. It is out side my province to comment on tnese courses of action as they/tney are rider consideration of Hie Majesty*® Government. I quite agree, of course, with Hie Excellency* a opinion that the political effect of the dieposseBeion ol the Shaikh would be deplorable, that it would be nothing short of a scandal if the Shaikh were dispossessed of his property after twenty-four years quiet enjoyment, and if actually dispossessed he will have a strong cl^im on His Maj esty 1 a Government for compensa- t i on • 3* The ihaikh' s legal position in the iteddaghiyeh, as well as in the iashiyeh, case was dealt with at some length in my despatch mo •824 -3 of 31st October 1932, containing coraiftents on Mr* Stafford's letter of 24th August 1932 to Sir jrancis Humphry© which ave cover to a Bote by . r• Alexander on both cases* the position with regard to tnese cases is now as follows* The Bashiyeh case has been decided against the Shaikh by the highest Court of Appeal in Iraq, but apparently he can ask for a review - vide paragraph 22 of Mr. Alexander's Mote; while in the Faddaghiyeh case summonses have been issued by the Court of First Instance* The following is a summary of arguments in favour of the Shaikh in these cases, some based on law, others on equity and political considerations* BABH1YEH * (a) There is no doubt that the purchase of this garden was a bona fide transaction and that the purchase price was paid. (Paragraph t&gt; of my letter of «&gt;lst October). (h) The Shaikh, unlike for his Faddaghiyeh estate, holds no Tapu for the Bashiyeh garden. The reason for this, however, was that the Turkish uovernment refused to register sales of land to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah unless they/thesy admitted that tney were Turkish subjects* (Paragraph 4 of ray letter of J^lat October) • One of the cardinal factors of our policy in the Gulf in pre-^ar years was opposition to Turkish claims to Kuwait, which His Majesty's Government were continually pressing on che shaikh, Xhe latter could argue that his omission to pi'oduce a Tapu was due - in part - to this pressure* (c) The Shaikh based his claim to the garden on prescriptive right, and under the Indian limitation Act was only stiort of the necessary time (12 years} by 4t months# (Paragraph b of my letter already quoted)• while time limits the laid down bj^Law must be observed, it is exceedingly hBrd on the Shaikh that he should lose his possession by such a short margin* (d) Moreover the Shaikh had witnesses to prove actual possession before the date mentioned in the Sanad of Sale, whom the Court refused to heax on the grounds that the Sanad of Sale on which he himself relied stated that the seller was in possession up to the date of the sale* This ruling of the Court seems to me of doubtful validity* A de facto possession of property by a purchaser f with the permission of the former owner and seller of that property, has under certain circumstances some weight in law, and it seems to me that the Shaikh* s witnesses might have been heard* if they had been heard, and could hf^ve proved previous possession to the satis faction of the Court, the iihaikh would have won his case* Mr* Alexander himself is doubtful as to the ruling of the Court on this point bemg correct* (paragraph 21 (a) of his l^ote) * (e) Under the Iraq Juand Act, which only prescribes 10 years limitation, and on which the Ghaikh alternatively based his case, he actually proved his prescriptive right* (Paragraph 5/5 of same letter^ Here, however, the provisions of Section 1674 of the Majelle i»aw were ruled to override the Land Act. I do not toow what tne exact wording of that Section amy fee, but X perceive that Mr.Alexander in his commenton this point (paragraph 9 of his X4ote) alludes to the 'principle underlying that section. There can often be two opinions on the ^principles* underlying laws# Mr# lexander thinks that this ruling might also be cnallenged. Fadda^hiyeh Case . (f) Mr. lexander takes two points in his Bote, (paragraph 7 of cay letter of 31st October). First - that the sal® was made without the consent of the heirs of tne sellers# Second • that it was essential that the seller or hie agent should have been present and admitted the sale. ith regard to the first point. The present claimant was a minor at the time of the sale, and as such could have no say in the transaction. To take an example. Suppossing 'A*, who has a minor son 4 years old, sesfcls property to it is surely unreasonable to suppose that ft A** must get the consent oi his son and heir before the sale is effected, or that the son lb or 20 years afterwards can institute a claim against 'B* because at the time of the sale he (the son) was not consulted by his father. With regard to the second point. The absence of the seller or his agent at the time of the sale would appear to be breach of a minor legal technicality, since the seller was of course well aware that the sale had been effected, and if he had any objection could have lodged it. In law, as outside it, silence is often b&amp;Ld to ive consent. (S) ♦ith reference to the remarks contained in para. ..iparagraph 2 of His excellency* s despetch on the letter written by Sir Henry Botbs to the Agent of the Shaikh with regard to Tapu granted to tne latter. Xt is witn considerable diffidence tiriat I offer any comments concerning a matter on «8hich his ^jccellency's Legal Adviser has already expressed an opinon. It is perhaps unfortunate that no proclamation was issued by tne Army Coiinraander, but from the letter itself tnere would appear certain points which at the least are arguable in the Shaikh's favour. Sir Henry Dobbs writes* M The Shaikh of Kuwait has during the last few years been paying the Miri tax on the Estate to the Qttoiaan Government, which must be held to have by receipt of the tax, acquiesced in the transfer of tne Estate to the Shaikh of Kuwaiti This would seem to be a strong argument in favour of the Shaikh. Later in his letter Sir Henry Dobts says? 'The position is accordingly tnis. Under the Tapu Law the sale of land cannot be registered and finally validated unless tne owner and the buyer appear before the Tapu Department in person or by authorised agent and testify to the fact of the sale and to the giving and receipt of tne purchases money. The present owners of the snares of Ahmad Pasha and Ayesha cannot now themselves appear before tiie 'apu and have failed to appoint an authorised agent for tne purpose. Hor is there any prospect of their intentions being discovered before tne end of the War• But the ^apu Department has satisfied itself by an inspection of tne papers signed before tae BrUian Consul at BaaraJa tnat, tnere was a formal Siile and delivery of tne snares of .vmaad .rasha and /vyeaha in tne l.state and tliat tiie sale for tiiose snares was paid; and in the peculiar ciroumstancss this would justify the Tapu Department in (grant ing a Tapu Sanad in respect of the sale of tnese shares.' The/-6- Department The failure to appear before the Tapu/lay not on the Shaikh, but on the other party* The latter could have taken action immediately on conclusion of the v /ar* They made no movement whatever until aome fourteen years later.

It would be desirable that the statement that the Sheikh, as an independent ruler, is unwilling to accept the service of judicial documents emanating from Iraq courts should be made after informal reference to the Sheikh. For your own information I am to explain that His Majesty's Government are not yet satisfied, (particularly having regard to the fact that the Sheikh appears to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Iraq courts in regard to his Bashiyeh property ) that it would in practice be possible to maintain the position suggested. But the primary interest at the moment is delay and they see no objection, if the Sheikh is prepared to take the line indicated, to the reply to the Iraq Goverment being of this nature. It will he Hon'ble.The fplitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. not/not be overlooked, in the same connection, that the absence of any protest by the Sheikh at this stage against the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts might well render it difficult, if not impossible, to take this point on his behalf should it on other grounds appear desirable to do so, at a later stage in the discussions. 3, Ab regards Sir F #Humphrys's telegram No#43 of 14th March relating to the documents &lt;tn the Faddaghiyeh case, I am to request that you will take action as suggested in that telegram* 4.

I should perhaps explain, however, that in the case of the Faddaghiyah gardens we do not think that the oheikh, in claiming imiiimity from process in the Iraqi courts, should go so far as to refuse to defend the suit when it eventually comes before the Court. For he would then inevitably lose his case, and we do not wish him to do so do 0 s unnecessarily. Indeed, even if the case/go against him, it may be important, for the purpose of aetemining the liability of His Majesty's Government under the guarantee given to him, that the ground on vo ich the case is decided agi-inst him should be clear. It may for instance make a difference whether he loses the case merely because of non registration or because the vendors never were in a position to confer on him a valid title. 3. We suggest, therefore, that when the case comes on, he should enter a defence under protest; and that every effort should be asade to ensure that the Court is favourably constituted, and that the oheikh has the best possible legu-l advice.

Dear Residency, We enclose for your information a copy of the minutes of a conference on the Shaikh of Kuwaiti date gardens which the Political Resident attended when he was in Bagdad last week. Yours ever, CHANCERY. The Residency, BUSH IRE*A conference was held in the Ambassador's room this morning. There were present besides the Ambassador; Lieut.-Colonel T.C«3?owle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Stafford, Financial Secretary. Mr. Hihill, Legal Secretary. The Ambassador said that he would like to consider first the actual present legal situation with regard to the two suits, Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah. Lieut.-Colonel Fowle pointed out that, although the - Shaikh had lost the Bashiyah suit in the Appeal Court, it still apparently remained open to him to apply for levision. If he did so, he would have to again accept the jurisdiction which might prejudice him in the matter of the Faddaghiyah suit; on the other hand, His Majesty's Government might take the view that he should exhaust all legal remedies open to him before coming to them for compensation. The Shaikh had two grounds on which he might base his claim for revision*- (a) that the Court had improperly refused to admit evidence that he was in possession prior to sale, and (b) that the 'Iraq Land Act should override the provisions of the Mejelle. If he was right on either of these two points the suit was statute barred. Mr. Nihill said that he thought it unlikely that a claim by the Shaikh for revision would be accepted by the Court. The Article in the Civil Procedure Code which dealt with revision of Appellate judgments made it clear that the only permissible grounds for revision were when an aggrieved party could show a prima facie case that the winning suitor had obtained his judgment by fraud or by the suppression of some material document. Both the points raised by the Political/-2- Political Resident were points of law which had already been before the Appeal Court. Mr» Stafford pointed out that the successful applicant would not be able to oust the Shaikh from possession until similar judgments had been obtained in favour of his co-heirs. Summonses had been issued by these co-heirs butthe Shaikh had refused to accept them. If ultimately the Shaikh accepted jurisdiction, presumably the points raised by Colonel 3?owle could be urged again on behalf of the Shaikh. The Ambassador asked Colonel Fowle how far he thought the Shaikh had been prejudiced by the advice given to him before the War by His Majesty^ Government on the question of his acceptance of Turkish nationality. Colonel Fowle replied that it looked as if the Shaikh could have acquired a Tapu title quite easily had he been willing to accept Turkish nationality. The Resident in the Gulf at that time certainly advised him not to do so s as it was His Majesty* b Government's policy to keep the Shaikh under their influence. Lieut.-Colonel Fowle said that, as regards the Faddaghiyah suit, the Shaikh was going to give as his reasons for refusal to accept service of the summons, that, as an independent rulerf he was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the 'Iraqi courts. Mr. Nihil1 said that this would be a valuable delaying move. He did not, however, think that the point was good in International law as the suit concerned immovable property situated within the jurisdiction. The Ambassador stated that in his view little further could be done until the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on the general question of the guarantee was received. But/3- But it would be necessary to bear in mind that, besides I &amp; e compensation for loss of revenue exemption, it looked as if the Shaikh might ultimately appeal to His Majesty's Government for compensation for loss of possession as well. The question of the revenue exemption was briefly dis cussed but it was agreed that no further useful action could be taken locally until the Law Officers had advised (a) as to whether there was any legal obligation on His Majesty's Government, and (b) if so, whether the istihlak tax is an infringement of the revenue exemption guarantee, 11th A^rilt 1955 .7 \ / I CONFIDENTIAL .

As there appears every reason to suppose that this particular Power of Attorney did exist, Messrs•Arteen and Yacub suggested to the Shaikh that he should try and get a copy of same frcm the old Turkish Records Office at Constantinople througih His Majesty^ Ambassador at Angora. They added that if such document could be produced the whole case for the prosecution wi^l fall to the ground and their opponents would withdraw the suit# 8 # I should be grateful, provided you see no objection to such course, if a copy of His Excellency*8 letter to me on the subject could be passed on to His Majesty^ Ambassador at Angora, with the request that steps be taken to obtain a copy of the document in question at as early a date as possible.- 3 I presume there would be no difficulty in this. 9» I migjit add t&amp;at I have taken pains to impress on Messrs Arteen and Yacub that His Excellency the Shaikh has already refused to accept any service of documents issued fey the IRAQ Courts in respect of the suit which has been filed in the matter of his Faddaghiyeh estates, and that they (Messrs Arteen and Yacub) were in no way to lie led into defending the case without specific orders to that effect• Their role for the present was to watch and advise only. 10• I said the same to the Shaikh, who assured me that his lawyers had precise instructions to do nothing unless instructed liy hinu I have the honour to toe.

My lawyers at Basrah recently asked me for all documents (sale deeds, title deeds etc*} connected with abovementioned property, which my late grandfather Shaikh Mubarak as-Sabah bought from Ahmad Pasha bin Qasim az- Zuhair according to the power of attorney which the latter got from his wife 'Aishah bint 'Abdulla Chalabi az-Zuhair, and which was issued by the then Qadhi of the Court of GALATA, Constantinople, one Mustafa Kadhim Eff., on the 15th Ramadhan 1326: My lawyers stated that they desired to study the papers so as to be fully cognisant with their contents, and to this end I forwarded all relevant docxments in my possession to them. They, however, again wrote to me asking me to send them a copy of 'Aishah's Power of Attorney to her husband, but. I replied instructing them to enquire from 1fce Basrah Courts, where they might perhaps be able to find recorded alogside with Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair's Power of Attorney granted to 'Abdul Wahhab Pasha al-Qirtas. After making a careful search they informed me that they could only find a mention of the date of the Power of Attorney required, and that this was quoted in the Power of Attorney given to 'Abdul/- s * Abdul WaMiab Paslia al—QJ.r'tas • An actual copy of the aboTeme nti one d Power of Attorney (the mis sing one) could not # therefore, be obtained, and the Attorneys consider it a matter of great importance, that they should have 4 such copy before them# The above being the facts I would request you to be so good as to write to His Excellency the British Ambassador at Constantinople (Angora) and ask him to kindly obtain a copy of the abovementloned Power of Attorney for me# Usual ending#nnWffT DENTIAL, No.76.

Briefly, the property was purchased by Shaikh Mubarak as-Sabah, grand-father of the present Ruler, from Ahmad Pasha bin (iasim az-^ubair in virtue of a power of attorney which the latter got from his wife 'Aishah bint 'Abdulla Chalabi az- ^ubair. The power of attorney was issued by the then (^adhi of the Court of Salata, Constantinople, Mustafa Kadhim Bffendi on the 15th Ramadhan 1326# 3o It is important that His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad should be able to produce a copy of l Aishah f s power of attorney to her husband, but it has not been possible up to the present to find either the power of attorney or a copy of it, although mention is made of the date of the power of attorney in another document. It is, however, thought possible that there may be a copy of the power of attorney in the records of the Court of Galata# 4. The question of the ownership of the date gardens which form this property is one in which His Majesty's Government is ^ deeply/ Bri tannic ** Majesty's Ambassador, A n £ jd 3? a #deeply interested, as during tlie War tney gave certain under takings to the Ruler of Kuwait in regard to his properties in 'Iraq. I, therefore, request that, if Your Excellency sees no objection, an endeavour may be made to obtain a certified copy of the power of attorney* 4» I would add that before the Max the Turkish Govern ment laid claim to Kuwait, but their claims were firmly resisted by His Majesty's Government, so that it seems desirable, in approaching the Turkish authorities, to lay as little emphasis as may be on Kuwait « 5.

I have sounded Nuri Pasha 'but without or course disclosing that question had heen referred to law officers for opinion. Attitude of Iraq.! Governuient, which has 'been consistent ly adopted in principle since time when Sir Heskell Sassoon was first Minister of Finance, is as follows;- Promises made to Sheikhs are in fact attributed to and were made under stress of war conditions at a time when protection of India and Anglo-Persian oilfields, not independence of Iraq.f was in question. Cost of these promises^ias unjustly fallen on IraQ. to extent of ahout 80,000 pounds and Ministry of Finance hasjprotested each year that exemptions are illegal. Iraq.! Government refuse to accept devolution of obligation which was not included in the list presented in 1924 and even contest liability to legalise exemptions already granted. Nuri Pasha hinted that if His Majesty # s Government have any claim against Iraai Government this might be referred to arbitration provided terms of reference were agreed on by both parties. Such terms should he said include quest ion of liability for exemptions enjoyed ^ince April 1921. In view of above 1 consider that there is no chance whatever/ Hwhatever ol Ira^i Govermiient giving way on this question whether faced with alternative of arbitration or not. It is my considered opinion that His Majesty's Government stand to lose more 'by taking Iraq.i Government to arbitra tion than 'by direct talk with Sheikhs since in latter event there is a good chance that Iraq.! Government might 'be persuaded to make no claim on account of past exemptions:. On general grounds also I strongly deprecate recourse to arbitration on so weak a case. Although no accurate figures will be forthcoming till next October instalment, in effect Sheikhs are not losing more than £5,000 per annum at present through operation of Ishtilak tax, possibly considerably less. I suggest simplest method of meeting our liabilities is to pay Sheikhs annual sum 'Do be agreed on to cover annual loss on exemptions, subject to review on death of present Sheikhs and to treat question of possession of gardens on its merits.I ^1' 4 ^ (B. 2082/308/93). \ No di strioution.

Your telegram No.69 (date^L gardens I d Irag of the Sheikhs of Fohammerah and Koweit). I should 'be glad of further explanation on following i points, as to which I am not clear. (1) Am I to assume that you now consider that His Majesty # s Government should themselves accept whole liability for compensating Sheikhs for loss of tax exemption, and that you no longer regard as practicable suggestion that IraQA Government should contribute indirectly hy grant of anti-smuggling subsidy to Sheikh of Koweit? (2) In describing case for arbitration as weak, did you overlook fact that Law Officers advised, in June 1930, that His Majesty # s Government would have a reasonable prospect of success? Law Officers would, moreover, probably l&gt;e consulted again on case as it exists today before decision to arbitrate were taken. (3) What is the precise meaning of your suggestion that question of possession (which may well prove crux of the whole matter) should be treated on its merits? Do you intend that His Majesty's Government should let matters take their course and should compensate Sheikh as and when dispossessed of portions of his property; or do you contem plate some arrangement whereby in return for acceptance by His Majes ty # s Government of. full or partial liability in respect of tax exemption, Iragi Government would undertake A' to/t0 vallcUite ShelKh's title, at all events in case of Fadaghiyah estate?

Your telegrams Nos.60 and 70 (of 27th April. Date gardens of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohiammerah). First essential is to protect Shaikh of Kuwait from dispossession. This has now become paramount consideration, ^art from serious damage to British prestige, dispossession might involve payment by His Majesty^ Government of a very substantial sum in compensation, and Iraqi claimants might not rest content with ejecting Shaikh but might put forward claim (even if this should not prove enforceaHe) to an account of all profits made by Shaikh from estate during period of wrongful occupation. 2. If Shaikh's title could be made secure, it is probable that His Majesty's Government would agree to waive claim to tax ememption, and would arrange themselves to compensate both Shaikhs in respect of future taxation, provided that Iraqi Government for their part abandoned claim to arrears of tax and undertook to impose no discriminatory taxation on Shaikhs in future. 3. Every possible effort should therefore be made to induce Iraqi Government to validate Shaikh's title by legislative or administrative act. Intervention by Iraqi Government is fully justified on grounds of equity, since, owing to a purely technical flaw in Shaikh's title, normal process of law would lead/-2- lead to grave injustice. Legislation to remedy position need not refer expressly to Shaikh of Kuwait but might take the form of general measure of validation similar to post-tfar United Kingdom legislation, (e.g,Indemnity Act and War Charges Validity Act). Such an act would be in accordance with normal practice of nations and would be entirely consistent with principles underlying Part 8 of Iraqi Constitution. 4. I appreciate that Iraqi Government might find it more difficult to intervene in case of Bashiyah estate than in that of Faddaghiyah estate! v/hich was registered by responsible official acting in the due discharge of authority regularly conferred upon him during military occupation - see note to Article 114 in Hooper's edition of Iraqi Constitution). But if at all possible Iraqi Government should be persuaded to redress miscarriage of justice in Bashiyah case also. 5. Unless you see overwhelming objection, please explore the possibility of an amicable settlement on the foregoing lines, making it clear in your discussions with the Iraqi Government that you are acting a titre personnel and 'without prejudice 1 *. While you alone can judge what arguments are most likely to prove effective, I suggest that you emphasize the desirability of disposing of this troublesome question, which may seriously affect the relations between the two Gove nments, tefore King Feisal visits this country in June. Also you might state that His Majesty's Government take so serious a view of the question of possession that it is your personal opinion that, failing an amicable settlement, they may well feel compelled to refer the whole issue, including the question of taxation, either to the Council of the League of Nations or to The Hague under Article 10 of the Treaty; and you/-3- you might point out the unfortunate effect which this would have upon IraQis international reputation so soon after her admission to the League of Nations. 6* The question of the co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait in suppression of smuggling, in return for payment to cover cost of preventive measures, might be discussed at the same time, if you consider it advisable in interests of securing a settlement. Shaikh will presumably be more ready to co-operate if his grievances over date gardens are removed. /&gt;.i n*- -CV-Copy JIO DISTRIBUTION. (E 2189/30 8/y3). Cypher telegram to Sir F.

Method of compensating Shaikh of Ku.ait for dispossession suggested in paragraph 3 of your telegram .No.70 [ of April 27) will be studied. Prima facie, however, I doubt whether it would provide a satisfactory solution. There is at present no certainty that action against heirs of vendors for recovery of original purchase price would be successful, or that, if successful, the heirs would be in financial position to pay. (See last paragraph of Legal Secretary^ memorandum enclosed in your letter of Liarch 2 to Hall). 2. Is there no law in Iraq similar to Statute of Limitations in this country which would limit date as from which Iraqi CJovernment could claim arrears of tax from the Shaikhs?that we would have received something 'by- today from Colonel Fowle in this connection, or from P.A., Kuwait, in answer to Residency memo.

I have outlined a self-contained draft to H.B.M.'s Ambassador, Angora, because it is possible that Ambassador not knowing the full circumstances might send a copy of the Shaikh's letter to the Turkish Government and if he did it is also just possible that ^he personal letter of the Shaikh would remind some one of the old Turko-Kuwait controversies. I appreciate of course that we cannot get the document without bringing the Shaikh into it but a self-contained letter may afford less chances of difficulties arising. Will U.S. kindly look through the draft as he is familiar with the case, 29/4/33. P.E. I presume you meant me, not U .S. I venture to suggesx the omission of the passage markedmarked; j in para 4. H.M.G*. have not made any definite pronouncement on this point, and although your statement is guardedly expressed it would perhaps he preferable to avoid making it. I have no other remarks to offer.

The correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ by the British Government in return for his military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.The correspondence in the file focuses on a legal dispute regarding Shaikh Aḥmad's ownership of two date garden estates in particular named Faddaghiyeh and Bashiyeh.The file contains a report labelled 'secret' entitled 'Note on the Various Points in Dispute between His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Iraq Government in respect of certain Garden Property on the Shatt-Al-Arab' (ff 99-105) that contains a detailed summary of the dispute.A sketch map showing the portions of land in dispute is contained on folio 209 and followed by an explanatory note (ff 210-212).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001f7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
