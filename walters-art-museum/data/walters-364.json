The \"segmentum\" (ornamental tunic patch) depicts dancers involved in what was probably intended to be a Dionysiac dance to celebrate regeneration and rebirth. The commonly used grape vine border, which frames the central portion of the panel, also acts as an allusion to Dionysus and to renewal and prosperity associated with him.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14323", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-04-03T17:14:47.587", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_83.485_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_83.485_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_83.485_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_83.485_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_83.485_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "3316", "Images": "PS1_83.485_DetA_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_83.485_DetB_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_83.485_Fnt_DD_T10.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
