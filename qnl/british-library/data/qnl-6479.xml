NOTE on p E K s I A. statement some years ago,—to initiate reforms. But° there is only one answer to this, viz., that no reforms will now keep Russia out of his country, which matter is, after all, the one which principally concerns the interests of Great Britain. 8 ' questions which appear to he immediately occupying the mind of the Shah and his advisers are(1) The proposed railway in Southern I ersia; ( 2 ) Ihe dispute between Persia and Afghanistan as to the district of Hashtadan; (3) The settlement of the boundary, generally, between Persia and Afghanistan, from Zulfikar southwards to Seistan, and (4) the right to Bahrein in the Persian Gulf. 4. As to the first question, it may briefly be said that the Foreign Office (assisted by Colonel \Villiams,-R.E., of this Office and myself) have drawn up a carefully prepared railway contract, of which the final draft was sent to Mr. Nicolson on the 11th January 1887, with an intimation that, if accepted by the 1 ersian Government, it was believed that responsible firms in this country would be ready to take the matter up and bring it before the public. I understand that the Foreign Office would give Baron Reuter a share in the transaction, and that the Baron himself, in this case, might perhaps be induced to drop his claims of past years on the Persian Govern ment so far as regards Southern Persia and the British scheme. It must be added, that I am not sanguine of the scheme being successfully launched on the London market, even if approved by the Shah, without a guarantee of some kind from the Imperial and Indian Governments. 5. In regard to the second question, I understand, from a telegram from Mr. Nicolson to the Foreign Office of the 24th February 1887, that the Government of India have offered to arbitrate between the Shah and the Amir as to the Hashtadan district, and that the Shah has accepted the offer. This perhaps is the best solution of a troublesome question, although it is impossible to be hopeful of the Indian Government being able to please two barbarians. 6. As to the third question, now raised in a letter from Malcom Khan to the Foreign Office, I am of opinion that the present moment is an inexpedient 15327. I. dl7.2 one for dealing with a matter which is full of pitfalls and difficulties. This, it will be seen by the accompanying copy of a Despatch to India, of the 17th September 1886, is also the opinion of the Secretary of State. The im portance of the question is not, of course, to be underrated ; but it is better, I submit, not to stir in the matter until the question of the north-west boundary of Afghanistan is settled. 7. The fourth question, that of Bahrein, is one which it is difficult to com press within the limits of this Note. It may be sufficient to say that we have for many years past resisted the unfounded claims of Persia to that island and district, and that on account of our pearl fisheries there, and for other reasons, it is vital to our interest that we should admit no discussion in reference to it. 8. In regard to Persia generally, it is, I fear, an indisputable fact that the Shah is in no way to be trusted. He is an intriguer, and is now hopelessly Russianized. Our only chance of regaining influence in Persia appears to me to rest on our present effort to construct a railway, und(;r British auspices, from the Karan river into the interior of Persia, to establish good relations with the Zil-i-Sultan (the Shah’s eldest son, although not his heir), and to endeavour to gain a footing in Ispahan and in Southern Persia generally, leaving Teheran and Northern Persia to their fate. 9. It may be added, that the last effort of this Office to do sometbino- for Persia, with the help of Germany, was in 1885. Copies of my Note on the subject and of Lord Randolph Churchill’s letter to the Foreign Office are appended. That effort failed because Prince Bismarck, on being sounded in regard to it, would have nothing to say to us. 25th February 1887. O. T. B. APPENDIX. Note by Sir Owen Burne, dated 18th July 1885. Ou the 27th of May last Lord Granville telegraphed to Sir R. Thomson, in reply to certain representations made by the Shah touching a definite understanding being arrived at between England and Russia as to the integrity of Persia, and “ thus secure the eastern frontier of Khorassan from “further aggression,” that “ His Majesty’s representations would be borne “ in mind by Her Majesty’s Government, and if a favourable occasion presented “ itself of securing such an arrangement it would not be neglected,” &amp;c., &amp;c. The Shah, through Sir R. Thomson (9th June 1885), now states that this is satisfactory so far as it goes, but that he requires a more precise and distinct statement as to the policy which England would pursue in the event of an unprovoked aggression being made by Russia upon Persian territory. “ An “ assurance,” says Sir R. Thomson, “ that Her Majesty’s Government would “ do all that may be practicable to preserve the integrity of Persia, and that “ they would also use their influence with Germany and other Powers with “ the object of preventing any unprovoked aggression being made by Russia upon I ersian territory, might afford the Shah that feeling of security which “ would encourage him to show some firmness in existing unjust demands, “ and lead him to adopt more effectual measures for the preservation of his “ own independence.” This advice is followed by Sir R. Thomson’s telegram of 17th July in which he expresses extreme doubt if the Persian Government will adopt effectual measures against Russian movements near the Heri-Rud, “ Unless “ Petersburg!! Eastern Khorassan by representations at St. It appears to me that Sir R. Thomson’s advice may be usefully followed as a sort of intermediate stop-gap. It is not very bold, but it is tolerably safe, as it cannot do us much harm to say that we will do “ all that is practicable ” ioi the Shah, that we will “ use our influence with Germany,” &amp;c., and that we will make representations to Russia.”much real importencrtosuch^ssurauce? t0 belieTe that the shal &gt; will attach as hundredth time, and was submit that,- shoulders ot futurity, this Department ventured to Very little is to ho hoped in regard to n «nponcefni • x advance along the north-eastern frontier of Persia dther frT % ^ ssi ^ n correspondence, or from Persian effort.

In icgard to this important question in its earlier stages, I recommend a glance at portions of my note on “Persia,” and of Mr. Moore’s note on Hussian Movements in Khorassan, &amp;c., herewith put up. (Signed) O. T. B. P.S. The deputation of a special Minister from England of well-known lame and repute, might advantageously precede any active measures Persia- wards. Sir II. 13. Wolff, for instance, or some man of that sort, would be an admirable appointment, failing Sir Henry liawlinson, who probably would not care to go now to Teheran. Copy of a Letter from India Office to Foreign Office, dated 25th Julv 1885. lam directed by Lord Pandolpli Churchill to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of* the 17th and 22nd instant, enclosing respectively a telegram from Sir 11. Thomson relative to Russian movements in Persian territorv on the left bank of the Heri-Rud, and copy of an instruction which thei 4 Marquis of Salisbury has addressed to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, on the general question of the interest of this country in the maintenance of the integrity of Persia. , . l In oonnectioa with these papers, I am desired by Lord Randolph Churchill to suggest for Lord Salisbury’s consideration whether, in view of the situation in Afghanistan, as well as upon broad grounds of imperial policy, the time has not come when steps should be taken to encourage the Shah to endeavour to otter some effective resistance to the progress of Russian encroachments on his borders. , Lord Randolph Churchill is very sensible of the difficulties which are interposed to the adoption by Her Majesty’s Government of measures with the object above suggested, by. the weakness and apathy of the Persian Government, the commanding position which Russia lias already assumed on the Khorassan frontier, the Russian proclivities of some, at any rate, of the local border authorities, and the futility of mere remonstrances at St. Petersburgh. But it appears to His Lordship that an attempt might at least be made to develope a policy towards the Shah which would inspire His Majesty with greater contidence than he at present feels in the goodwill of the British Government towards him, and indicate their sympathy with him in the difficult position in which he finds himself placed. If it be the case, as stated by Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, in his Despatch, No. 65, of the 9th ultimo, that an assurance that Her Majesty’s Government will do all that may be practicable to preserve the integrity of Persia, and will also use their influence with Germany and other powers with the object of pre venting unprovoked aggression upon Persian territory, might have the effect of inducing the Shah to show some firmness in resisting unjust demands, and lead him to adopt more effectual measures for the preservation of his independence, it seems to Lord Randolph Churchill to be in the highest degree desirable that such an assurance should he given. His Lordship would further suggest whether, in connection with the overtures understood to be about to be made at Berlin by the Persian Government, communi cations might not be opened with Prince Bismarck on the question, with a view to ascertain his feelings in regard to it, and the extent to which the German Government might be prepared to go, now or hereafter, in co-operation with Her Majesty’s Government, in the adoption of measures calculated to prevent the complete subordination of Persia to Russia which is now threatened. In support of the foregoing views, Lord Randolph Churchill would only observe, in conclusion, that any settlement of the Afghan frontier which may now be made‘'Vill certainly be incomplete, and may possibly be altogether void of effect, unless it be supplemented by such arrangements in reference to the eastern frontier of Khorassan as may tend to safeguard Herat from danger of aggressive movements from that quarter.
