It chiefly comprises copies of the proceedings (in French) of the 99 through to the 127 meetings of the Council, forwarded by the British Ambassador at Tehran (Sir George Head Barclay; Sir Walter Beaupre Townley) to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey), and then forwarded by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the Under-Secretary of State for India.The proceedings detail reports of epidemics (including plague, cholera, malaria) occurring in Persia and its neighbours (including the Persian Gulf, Russia, India), and measures taken to implement quarantine and vaccination measures to prevent their spread. In the reports, recurring mention is made of epidemics in Kermanshah [Kermānshāh], Khorassan [Khorāsān], Bouchir [Bushire] and Astrakhan. Interspersed with the meeting proceedings are copies of British Government correspondence, chiefly in the form of detailed accounts of the meetings, written by Dr Anthony Richard Neligan, physician at the British Legation in Tehran, who attended meetings in his capacity as Doctor of the Legation (Médecins de Légations).The part includes a divider which gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (f 3).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Tehran Sanitary Council</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Tehran, Physician to</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kermānshāh (inhabited place)</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khorāsān</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Astrakhan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Epidemics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Cholera</topic></subject><subject><topic>Plague</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bubonic plague</topic></subject><subject><topic>Malaria</topic></subject><subject><topic>Vaccination programmes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Quarantine</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000af#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000af#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
