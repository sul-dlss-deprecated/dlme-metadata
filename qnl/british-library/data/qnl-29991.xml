Finally, the Minister said that his Government were much disturbed by recent developments in Persian Azerbaijan. He handed me a memorandum which recites at length the alleged misdeeds of the Soviet authorities and explains that they form an obstacle to the conclusion of the Treaty* I emphasised that the Persian Government should_discuss questions of this sort with the Soviet authorities direct&gt; since the Russians preferred this procedure and it was difficult for us to act as intermediaries.

Your telegram No e 75 [of January 14th: proposed Anglo- Soviet-Persian Treaty], p . 0 . I have reconsidered position in the light of your ^trpng recomendations, I note that the Persian Prime Minister has been induced to abandon the third proposed assurance, which, as you know, has been regarded here as the most unacceptable from our point of view. There is nothing objectionable about assurances ( 1 ) or ( 4 ), though as regards the former it should be understood that this does not conflict with the role of the Persian army as out lined m Article 3 (2) (a). As regards assurance (2), you are^of course right in believing that we do not intend to insist that the Persian Government shall pay for purely military works not necessary to Persia, but if we were to agree to the formula which you suggest, we might be committed in advance with regard to many points which will only come up for discussion in the later financial negotiations provided for in Article 4(2) of the Treaty. This objection could however be overcome if assurance were redrafted as follows “With reference to Article 4 (2), it is understood that there is no provision in the Treaty which requires that the Persian Government shall bear the cost of any works which the Allied Powers carry out for their own military ends and which are not necessary for the needs of Persia'. 2. I have therefore asked the Soviet Ambassador to suggest to his Government that they should authorise your Soviet colleague to agree to further notes on the lines suggested in your telegram No s 20, provided that assurance ( 2 ) is redrafted on the lines indicated above and that assurance/5) is omitted. As soon as your Soviet colleague receives instructions to support you, you should inform the Prime Minister that you are authorised to agree to these notes^ You should make it clear,, however, that I have only agreed to thiw final concession as the result of your strong recommendations and that it is my last word on the subject/ In return for this concession, I expect the Treaty to be signed and to enter into force immediately. You should therefore tell the Prime Minister that if it is not signed within a fortnight after the date on which you make this demarche,.His Majesty's Government and the Soviet Government YJll consider themselves free to resume their complete liberty of action.

Soviet Ambassador eventually received instructions in the sense desired by you and we informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs January 13th that no changes or assurances coula.be made-&gt; Since then the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of War, who are all strong supporters of the ‘Treaty and helpful to us, have asked me urgently whether His Majesty's Government cannot do something to support the Prime Minister* The Prime Minister who, .I understand, has sent .you another appeal through the Persian Minister in London is most unwilling to have to tell the Majlis that the Allies have completely disregarded his representationso It is possible that we made a tactical error in not securing the signature before presentation to the Majlis since the fact that the Treaty had only been initialled left, the. door open for argument® However that may be, the Prime Minister.feels that his position will be greatly damaged and; the possibility.of securing the respect or the majority for the Treaty reduced if he cannot give the Majlis some slight satisfaction® There is no dispute about the fourth of the. proposed assurances since you had already authorized it to be - given* In addition, the Prime Minister regards the first two as essential® Although I believe that a good case could be made against your argument concerning letters of September 6 th, I induced the Prime Minister to abandon this point but the first two assurances remain to be dealt with* N 2 * Assurance about the army is not merely repetition of reference to the role of the army in Article 3: 'it leaves the Persian.Government free to offer spontaneous resistance to German invasion if they wish without putting this in words which might revive the accusation that the Allies wist? to use the Persian Army in their wars* . . ^ 0n drafting second sentence of assurance, I rejected several formulae which might have helped to prejudge the matter open to argument, but I am unable to believe even the.Soviet Government would expect Persia to pay for purely military works not.necessary to Persia* I hear from many sources that deputies and public are most anxious on this point.4c 1 1 have good reason to know that you extresiely dissatisfied with the progress of these negotiations 0 So am I and although I do not think that all difficulties have been caused by Persians I know they have been tiresome.

Apart from the question whether each of the assurances proposed would or would not be unobjectionable in itself, I feel that it Would be undesirable, as well as unnecessary, to get drawn into further detailed discussions with the Persian Government on these or any other points connected with Treaty. The negotiations—- have already lasted far too long. If we were, to give the Persian Government assurances to enable them to meet the Majlis criticisms, this would simply lead'to - request for further assurances, to complaints that assurances given were inadequate, or to other suggestions for minor modifications to elucidate some comparatively unimportant point. The.only way to avoid indefinite delays is to insist that the time for discussion is past and the time for decisions has come. ‘ •: 4.. You should therefore inform the Persian ; Prime Minister that His Majesty's Government are not prepared to give any further written assurance in addition to those already contained in the Treaty itself and its two Annexes.

Following is summary of my communication to the President [? group omitted] days ago. 2. In spite of Minister for Foreign Affairs' latest assurances, action has not been taken, and we are as far as ever from signature. Persian Government surely cannot realise the effect on His Majesty's Government of these delays. Communications have been made to the Foreign Office on the strength of successive assurances by Persian officials as to early signature and the Foreign Office seeing new reasons for delay advanced, could not but regard them as pretexts v/hile public opinion not only in Great Britain feels as Foreign Office must feel, that Persian Government are not taking the question seriously. 3. Persian constitutional procedure cannot be so rigid that v/ay out cannot be found, or such that the special sessions of Parliament cannot be called. 4. On the signature there arc certain agreements to be negotiated which will bring serious economic benefits to Persia. Do Persians intend to introduce same delays into those negotiations ? We will do.all we can [group undec.: ? to] [group undec.: ? speed] them up but neither v/e nor the Soviet authorities are likely to be encouraged to do so by sorry spectacle of the present delays and unconvincing excuses. 5.

Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Squire yesterday (I was in bed with influenza) that the Government had overcome all opposition except to Article 5 (2) (A) for which they wished to substitute ’’the Allied Pov/ers will, however, not require the Persian forces to take part in military operations”. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Soviet Ambassador had agreed to this change and was telegraphing to his Government urging its acceptance. This statement, however, turned out, on enquiry, to be totally untrue. Not only that, but there is distinct possibility that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was trying to rush us into accepting, without realising it, all responsibility for military operations inside Persia connected with internal security. 5. However, there is no doubt that the present wording leaves something to be desired and while I certainly do not recommend either this or any other last-minute change, I think, after signature, there might be an exchange of notes to the effect that if at any time the Persian Government wished to offer active military co-operation their proposal would receive most sympathetic consideration. This would raise the army-morale- (s ee_my telegram No. 1367) and prove less damaging to Persian prestige. ' ‘ — 4.

I then said that I had two painful subjects to discuss, proceeding, the first was that Persian Government, in spite of the agreement reached by His Majesty’s Minister with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had given the text of the treaty to the press; and pointed out in rather strong terms the excellent opportunity thus afforded to the Germans to criticise and undermine, before the signa ture was effected^ The Minister for Foreign Affairs denied having made any such agreement, and both he and the Prime Minister insisted that publicity was absolutely essential, that the people could not be kept in the dark, and similar complet ly unconvincing arguments, 5„ I continued, that the second matter was even more serious, I hac. been told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that signati re could not take place for at least 10 days. We had shown very great patience in face of continued and/unjustifiable delays, but that in my personal opinion, w.iich I was certain would be shared by you, this latest delaying manoeuvre passed all bounds.

I am all the less disposed to do this since these ”final' comments seem to me to be either trivial or else unacceptable. 2. Persian Government’s criticism of the word 'immunities' in Article 4- (ii) seems to be untenable. The word has a well recognised meaning in law and appears in the same connexion in our Treaties with Iraq and v/ith Egypt, and there is no possible implication, either in the case of those countries, or in that of Persia, that the word has anything to do with the Capitulations. Word 'exemptions' has no such meaning and would in the context apply to fiscal matters only. Present text must therefore stand. 3. As regards proposed amendment to Article 6 (i) and to Annex 1, Persian Government’s proposal is unacceptable. Their objection to the word 'direct' is not understood. I assume that the Persian Government do not really expect us to give them an undertaking to consult them in any matters which do not,(repeat not), affect the direct interests of Persia. I fear I could not agree to anything of the sort. In any case the Persian proposal regarding 'rights and privileges' goes far further than anything to which we could agree. $Sgi &lt;£Gd.

My telegram No. 1042 [of November 18th: proposed Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty], Persian Minister informed me November 19th that while his Government were in principle in favour of the Treaty, they were much exercised by the terms of our proposals. It would be a misfortune, he thought, if this Government were compelled to resign and Majlis might not approve the terms. The Minister asked in particular whether we could not agree more explicitly to Persia having a place at the peace conference and above all whether we could not improve Article 7 regarding economic help. 2. I told the Minister that I was sorry I could not meet him on either of these points. As regards the peace conference it was impossible to go further than I was proposing, since I could not visualise the circumstances in which peace would eventually be made. 3. As regards financial help I could not accept that the Persian Government were in difficulty there. They had considerable sterling balances available in this country which were at present frozen. These they would be able to use as soon as the Treaty was signed. I understood that Persian assets in the United States were now estimated at 'll million dollars. I suggested that what Persia needed was not money, but gooes, ¥e were doing our best to help in this and were shipping further supplies of wheat to Persia^before the end of the year. The Minister remarked thathis Government had not mentioned food in their telegram to him. I replied that this was none the less a most serious matter that confronted Persia. Her people were very short of food and we were trying to help them in this as in other matters. 4. Broadly the choice for Persia was clear. If she became an ally she would be in the same category as Egypt, Iraq, and Turkey, to all of whom we were sending supplies v and all of whom we had helped as far as we could in respect of their export trade. If, however, Persia was not an ally, she/2. she could not expect to continue to receive the favourable treatment v/hich we had been giving her, and we should then regard ourselves as under no treaty obligation towards Persia whatever. 5. I then read to the Minister the last two sentences of my telegram Wo. 1042 to you. The Minister continued to plead for the inclusion of something further in the Treaty which would give it a popular appeal. I replied that I had been through the text most carefully and I had accepted, subject to the-approval of our Soviet ally, a number of Persian amendments. I could now go no further. As soon as you had received the agreement of your Soviet colleague, you would see the Persian Government and put the full text as now proposed before them. I hoped that the Minister would use his utmost influence to advise his Government to accept this Treaty without further delay. I was confident that it was in Persia's interests to do this. 6. The Minister would remember that we and the Soviet Government had withdrawn our troops from Tehran some time ago. There had been some criticism of us for that action. The Minister said that we were entirely right to try to get the confidence of the Persian Government and people. I said if that were so, it was now for the Persian Government to prove that the confidence of their friends was justified. I quite understood that the Persian Government might think that they might meet with some criticism from the Majlis, but since what they were doing was in the interest of their country they should have the courage to face up to that. 7. The Minister was friendly but worried. I hope that I may have been able to put some heart into him. I made it plain that I was not able to discuss amendments with him, and that the detailed text of the negotiations was in your nands at Tehran. This he readily accepted.is Docu pent is the Pi With tho Om^limants ef ths I Under Secretary o?

The Cabinet_object to 'direct” where it appears in several places in Article 6 and the proposed letter tut offer to limit scope of the article to the Middle East, e.g. article itself would end * 'affecting the interests of Persia in the Middle East”. Unfcprtunately [grp. undec.: ?even] this* has a wider meaning than it used to nave before Egypt ana Levant were included in the Middle East Command. Nevertheless the acceptance of this amendment seems an easy way of pleasing the Persian Government. They attach the greatest importance however to rights and privileges” sentence in paragraph 5 of my telegram No, 1108. I believe they expect a share out of the spoil at the end of the war and are afraid of being absent v/hen it occurs, I have been unable to convince them that ”on a footing of equality” secures to them the same rights and privileges. Would P 0SS Tkl e to make the letter end ”in any peace negotiations affecting her interests in the Middle East so that she may enjoy the same rights and privileges as other powers participating in those negotiations”? The Cabinet have no further observations and I hope to induce them to accept as final your replies to this telegram and to my two telegrams under reference.

You will see that the revised draft .meets Persian wishes on several points: .; : (a) the minor amendments suggested in your ^ telegrams Nos. 1144 and 1145 are accepted; (b) in Article 5 we accept the proposal in your. 0 ^(,q te legrai No. 1145 and agree to withdraw our troops not later l * thin six months after the conclusion of an armistice or on the conclusion of peace. (c) we have accepted the Persian Government's views as regards Article 9, and have reverted to the original wording. But we expect the Persian Government to exercise sufficient pressure on the Madis to ensure that they accept the Treaty, We realise that'the members are jealous of their new-found liberty, but they must surely he susceptible to hints of undesirable consequences to their country if Ihey reject the Treaty. 3. I regret however that as regards financial and economic assistance I cannot agree to go further than the present draft of Article 7 0 It would be better to have no Treaty at all than to commit ourselves to vague obligations'which we should be unable to honour and which would give the Persians a heaven sent opportunity for pressing all sorts of financial and economic demands upon us and making trouble whenever we could not give them exactly what they wanted. Moreover, there is nothing to show that the Persians need foreign exchange. You RECo. POL. DtPr. ?1N0V 941 jNDIA OFFICE /couldcould remind them that as soon as the treaty enters into force their sterling balances in the United Kingdom will be unblocked and they will then have all the sterling that they need. As for ( -. dollars, His Majesty’s Government would require to be presented with a very convincing case before even considering a proposal ^ to help to provide Persia with more dollars, to swell Persian ^ accumulated dollar assets in the United Staxes, now estimated at eleven million dollars. I am by no means convinced that the Persians need financial assistance from us, and it is in any case improbable that the Soviet Government would be willing to under take such financial commitments to the Persians in present circ umstances. 4. It now remains to be seen whether the Soviet Government are prepared to agree to the prespnt text, which in our view at least gives the Persians many advantages, though it is perhaps not so clear what benefits tne Soviet Government and His Majesty's Government are likely to derive from it. If the Soviet Govern ment agree to its terms, the next step will be for you and your Soviet colleague to approach the Persian Government and ascertain definitely whether they are prepared to sign the present text or not. If so, you should arrange for signature to take place without further delay. If not, it will have to be made clear to the Persian Government that the favourable treatment which Persia has hitherto been receiving as a potential ally of the Soviet and British Governments will come to an end and we shall regard ourselves as under no treaty obligation towards Persia whatever. The Soviet and British Governments will have offered the Persian Government favourable and honourable terms, in pursuance of the Persian Government’s statement that they wished'to become our allies, and our offer, if not accepted without further delay, will be withdrawn once and for all. The Persian Government will not of course expect to receive the benefits which they would have gained under the Treaty, but will have lost through their own hesitation.[Thii ^ rfw £• klSSi /3V*&lt;f ( SV FILE COPY HufeSr' Phis Po curnent is the Property of His Britannic Mail’s G^venugent, and Should be kept With ItteaeASyck^and iSlyY '7 r*.

I pointed out that the last sentence gave the strongest assurance that could be expected since we cannot state definitely that Persia will be represented etc*, wM 1 e they themselves admit Persia is not interested in say fate of Iceland (C)* Tney know, however, that our enemies will be looking for signs that Persia is being given subordi nate place under the treaty (which they moreover would them selves resent) and I foresee great difficulty on this ccore* 3o Please see again amendments to article 7 proposed in my telegram No*, J 12H. 2nd paragraph promises that allies &lt;vnfV will do, what we on British side, are doing t already. So far as war conditions allow we are buying Persia’s exports ant supplying her needs and as to bud paragraph (c) I am trying to' enlist the support of the Shipping Committee in Basra^on behalf of Persian exporters, who have small quantities of goods for United States of America as well as for united Kingdom waiting at Bushire* The Russians might claim greater liberty under their commercial treaty, which they observe whenever it suits them, and to meet their views we could add H and existing commercial treaties, and agreements' after 'war conditions'. Minister of Finance agrees that this addition is necessary. 4, The question of financial assistance is admittedly more difficult but apart from the fact that, as I have said before, we shall have to assist Persia financially sooner or later, I would advance three arguments in support of my nroposal (a) Persia would naturally think it”highly unlikely Thac we gave British protection to the late Shah, and refused help to present regjme, (b) grant of financial assistance would give us the right of criticism of finance and revenue administration* The suggestion has been made in various quarters (most recently as a private enquiry from Simla) that foreign adviser should be employed by the Persian Government* /OnlyoOnly adviser we could recommend would, I think, he Americans, [sic]. Previous experience has not been happy but in present circumstances Americans might be less hostile to British i'nfl'uencey while the Russians being dependent on American help, ijiight £e'less hostile to the adviser. Negotiation of an agreement'for financial assistance would enable us to raise the ‘adti'sef question if we thought fit ? (c) in considering the^mount of financial help to be indicated in the proposed agreement^ we should require to examine the revenue resources or Persia and would-make it easier to discuss with the Russians certain methods they use ta detract, Persian* re venue, e.g,. in my telegram No. 8 S aving November loth, I reported that the Russians were selling goods without* paying customs dues, in contravention of their own commercial treaty and this is still going on. 5, I again urge most strongly that additions made to Article 7 and numbered (1) and (2) (a) (b) and (c) be accepted by His Majesty’s Government.[This Document is the Property of Hi Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept fAn ?.U)« P» &gt; .jmm ild be k&lt; a2fiic&gt; Va _ under Locjc and Key.] EXT ViHlifi &gt; ' 1 ‘ c - » f i^wti pi? 19^- v ' i 'etary or 5tale cign Atfaifs 'iMMDED COPY* jti/ s * [Cypher].

Your telegrams Nos, 1021, 1022 and 1026, After preliminary talk with Minister for Foreign'Arfair? I send the following observations: Article No. 5 (1). I suspect that the alternative which you prefer should be acceptable but the Minister for Foreign Affairs asks whether we could substitute ‘’defend” for ’’protect” as being more definite in the Persian equivalent. I recommend Article 4 (2). I recommend replacement of ’’adjustment” by ”arrangements” which not only goes better into Persian but avoids the suggestion that the Persian Government might have to make payments. Article 5 as now drafted is even less favourable to Persia than before. As it stood, the conclusion of peace was at # least to have been the signal for the departure of the allied troops, if that event occurred within a year from *the armistice* and the troops had not already gone; now the year might run. from the conclusion of peace, I suggest return to the wording given in your telegram No. 785 but with reduction of the period from one year to six months at* the outside. How could Persian Government explain to their assailant [grp.omitted ? s that] allied troops which occupied the country in a week might take a year to leave? Making all allowances for the difficulties which might attend the evacuation, I consider that political consid erations require reduction of the period to the lowest possible limit. We must realise that the mention of one year would justify some of the worst suspicions which the talk of a treaty has aroused here, and that retention of the Russians in Persia,&gt;' • *&lt;' • * ^ « V ■ **&lt;«i. ,V'*t &gt;■ &gt;» • ! vif • • f# for (Dne day deyond the strict minimum should he avoided^ The Russians are already trying in various quiet ways to gain influence which might he permanent, and our aim should he to ensure their departure as soon as hostilities cease. Article VII.

I am certain that, sooner or later, we shall have to give then some assistance if they are to be &amp;er&gt;t be fetter to admit the possibility now that the Cabinet might use it as one of the arguments in favour of ini&amp;ter for Foreign Affairs seems most anxious to the treaty j **.^ [ H set-.tne trejify signed and cut of the way.

There appear to be four main difficulties. (a) Article 3(i). I think Persian Government’s wishes could best be met by amendment to ^ a( 3- : _ 'The Allied Powers jointly undertake to protecTPersia by all means at their command from all aggression on the part of Germany or any other Power”. I should, however, oe prepared to agree to an alternative using the same wording, but stopping short at :, aggression : '. I should prefer former alternative, ^hnt jy-ould accept former-'a-l-t-ernativej but would accept the latter if necessary. (b) Financial questions. Articles 4 and 7. I would agree to new paragraph 2 in Article 4 if amended to read as follows. ’’A separate Agreement or Agreements shall be concluded as soon as possible after the entry into force of the present Treaty regarding any financial obligations to be borne by the Allied Powers under the provisions of the present Article and of paragraph 2(b), (c), and (d) fof Article 3 above, and any financial &lt; adjustments^necessary in such matters as local purchases, hire of buildings and plant, employment of labour, transport charges, and any transfers to the Persian Government after the war of buildings and other improvements effected by the Allied . Powers. 'fhese agreements shall also settle the immunities to be enjoyed by the fohces of the Allied Powers in Persia', lo/I cannot, however, accept the proposed addition to .article 7, see paragraph 10 of -.vaur- telec:rain No. 1125^ ,/e shall not be able to afford assistance to the degree which the Persians will expect, and..cannot corhdt ourselves in a Treaty to undertakings v/hich we know we shall be unable to carry out in practice, I would, however, agree to addition to article 7 of second sentence as follows, n 0n the entry into force of the present Treaty discussions shall be opened between the Government of Persia and the Governments of the Allied Powers*as to the best possible methods of carrying out the above under- taking' 1 , (c) article 6. Addition to paragraph 1 proposed in your telegram N o, 1108 i s not acceptable, and indeed it must be evident r ’to Persian Government that it is, out of the .question that they should be given an assurance that they will be represented at any conference or at any international assemblies which may be held, irrespective of the questions' which-are to be discussed,, I suggest, therefore, that former text of paragraph 1, should be accepted, with the addition of the word.'sovereignty', and that the question of Persia's representation at the peace conference should be settled by a separate published exchange of notes on the lines of my to 1 egrai n No. 995 [of 7th November], Alternatively, if the Persian Government prefer, ; I would agree that this exchange, of notes should be redrafted as follows. t 'With reference to Article 6 paragraph 1 of the Treaty of .alliance signed to-day ; I have the honour, on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, to assure Your Excellency that my Government interpret the provisions of ’this clause as being applicable to any peace conference or conferences held at the conclusion of the present war, or other general international conferences. Consequently they consider themselves bound not to approve anything at any such conference which is prejudicial to the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence of Persia, and not to discuss at any such conference anything affecting the direct interests of Persia without consultation with the Government of Persia. His Majesty's Government will further do their best to secure that Persian will be. r^:.^sented on a footing of equality in any peace negotiations directly affecting her interests'. (d) Article 9. I should be- most reluctant to agree that the Treaty must be ratified by all the parties concerned. The wording suggested means formidable political difficulties if the Majlis eventually refusesE t: )bv 3 . 1941 l to ratify. So far as this ewntry is concerned . ratification is not necessary, and indeed it v/onld he k preferable not to ratify, especially since instruments 1 of ratification would take so long to reach you. Persian Government can surely devise some procedure whereby not only Treaty will enter into force on signature, but also Majlis* approval v/ill be obtained within say 21 hours. Such a procedure nay be abnormal, but these are abnormal t imes,.and ve canned accept position in which treaty would be nominally in force but with the possibility that it might be' annulled at any moment by Majlis. I would therefore press strongly for acceptance of our original draft. For further minor amendments see my Lnmediately following telegram. I have not yet approached Soviet Ambassador and shall be glad if your immediate views on above proposals in order that I may do so. —7-t&gt; t «-u^ t &lt;rv\ •J 1 % &amp;tn# of Qr#»t si **$£0 IrelMtui «n4 lb# »rttt*h j&amp;lni&amp;nB beyond tho ^eno t l&lt;w»p«ror of Indift, tind the Union of -Jovist &gt;oclAllat »osmbllo« 9 on th« ont ti4ind f mnd Hit Iw .erl»l Mo^voty tti« ihnhln^hnh of Imti on the other; being ftnxlou* to r&amp;c»«rv« the territorial integrity and political Independence of Iran and to ^onaolldate the friendehlp end relation* of { ?ood ond^rttending between thee; and an.&lt;f ^ a ^ t at t. •’5ft illj cte will b&lt; et be echUvVfc'd , M thv; conclusion of e treaty of elliance; iieve agreed to conclude e treety for this purpose arid have appointed ae their plan!potent liaise; Hie Majesty The ding of Clreet Britain, Ireland, and the brltieh r'j*5tnIons beyond the Seas, &amp;asperor of Indie, For Clreet Britain end Northern Ireland, Irtj C J-c-Pe-t) Hie Haleety The King of Oreat Britain, Ireland and the brltlsh Peelnione beyond the £eae, iueperer of Indie, and the Unton of Soviet TJooinllat Hepublioe, on the one hand, and Hie Imperial Hajeaty the ^hahinehah of Iran, on the other; Having in view the princlplee of the Atlantic Charter jointly agreed upon and announced to the world by the Freeident of the United of =&gt; r ica ^.ic : ♦ riae ‘ 4 inlster/on the 1 vth ^uguwt,/oA/■*&lt; T^il^with which Hie Imperial V** rfajvety the dhah declaree hie complete agreement end frois which he wishes to benefit on an e^ual ■baels with other nations of the n.^^Tworid en4/being anxious to strengthen 1 the bonde of friendship and mutual the Union of Soviet &gt;oeialist Hepwbllos, His Imoerisl Sajesty the mahinahah of Iran, who having comaunloetad their full powers, found in good snd due fora, have sgreed ee follows; i£Li£lS_l* His M«jeety The King of draat jbrUeln, Ireland and the British Itominions beyond the seas, a® f &gt;eror of India, and the Union of Soviet Socialist ftepubliee (hereinafter referred to ae the 111led rowers) jolnvly undertake to reelect the territorial integrity and political independence of Iran. je±m* &amp; frlendohip underetandlng between theai;^^ Considering that these objects will best be achieved by the conclusion of e treaty of alliance; Have agreed to coacluds * treaty for this purpose and have appointed ee their plenlpot ntiariee; fu U.K. ef* Hie bejooty The King of/ar«?at Britain, Ireland, wnd the hrltieh dominions beyond the ieee, .^etperor of Indie, For Orest Srttsin and northern Ireland, tfc* Union of Soviet Socialist Sepublloe, hie Imperial Sajcety the ihehlasheh of Iran, ho having eoosunlcated their full powers, found in good end due Torm f have agreed ae follows; ahU&amp;IsUL* His Majesty I he hirxg of Orest Britain, irelaad end the British Detain Ions beyond .ne sees, haperor of India, aid the Union of ioviet looislist Republics (hereinafter referred to ae the Allied * owere) jointly p \d aeverelly undertalce to respect the terrltorisl integrity, sovereignty and political Independence of Iren.A /6 _ F* 0 .

My telegrams 1108 and 1114. F* ^ F-* g*fE6&gt;/34W*/3&lt;Ml After more meetings I am able to report the conditions on which the Persian Government would sign treaty. If these differ slightly from those mentioned in my telegrams under reference, it is in the right direction. ' For instance, I believe that in the last resort the Persian Government will accept the word 'alliance”. They dislike it and fear its effect upon the public, but there are indirect signs that if we can give them satisfaction in other directions they will not reject the treaty on that one point. 2 . I have had to bear in mind that the Persian Government see little need for a treaty, and that the public, who have not forgottdn the treaty of 1919 and the bribery by which we secured it, regard the idea of a treaty with deep suspicion, especially as one of the parties is the Russians. It would ear fran t paragraph No. 1 of your telegram No.992 that Majesty s Government consider that Persia' would regard at least with equanimity the prospect of a German invasion, but Persian opinion on the whole believes that there would have been no danger of a German attack on Persia but for the presence of the allies, and a large proportion of the public * would rejoice if the Germans or anyone else drove the Russians out. The present Government would resign rather than accept treaty as difficult to defend as our original draft, and whatever happened after that, resignation alone would be hailed as a German victory. In fact the Prime Minister, who is naturally hostile to the German policy, has stuck to his difficult task in spite of ill-health, in order not to give a handle to German propaganda. I thought it my .duty, in order to avoid the chaos which might follow his resignation, to try to help.him out of his difficulties. I trust when the amendments.in my immediately succeeding telegram have been examined, it will he fnnnri that, the sncrcrec: t.Rri -nr*i r*p&gt; i qit 2 . r yr vr t, t‘ Turkey in circumstances which would not necessarily imply association with Germany, and the need of such assurance will appear to them all the more urgent when we press them to sell us all their tanks and other heavy ^ war material. .4r* The question of credits has been reduced to a promise of ,f financial assistance on terns to be embodied m a subsequent agreement”. ^ 1 have kept the Soviet Ambassador fully informed out he has not attended the recent discussion for three reasons. • i. • ^ r c;: f jj ^ * ., , Hdvyig been empowered by his Government to sign th§’treaty'as * drafted by the Foreign Office, he did not i a 3 Goveriiment s clumsy counter dratft Which sent to the Soviet Government as it was.

My telegram No. 1108^ The Prime Minister was prepared to resign rather than accept our text, even with the amendments set forth in my above-mentioned telegram, but offered to make a final effort to reach agreement. Having again obtained [grp, undec: ? approval] from the Soviet Ambassador I have just had 5 hours discussion with the Prime Minister and four of his ministers. _ 2. Most serious point by far is the question of aggression. The Persian Government are seriously alarmed at recent press attacks by the Turkish press on the subject of the Turkish speaking minoritv in Azerbaijan and feel that even revised formula for Article 3(1) suggested in your telegram ftp. 94 2 does not meet the case of a possible attack by Turkey not in association with Germany. Possibility is admittedly remote, but Persian Govern ment’s fear is genuine. I have-pointed out that His Majesty’s Government^ could not accept (the) formula, which obviously pointed to Turkey, as 4 we can think of no formula which is not open to that objection to some.extent, e.g. if clause stops at word ’’aggression”. I would urge however that some means be sought to reassure the Persian Government on that score as it would do much to reconcile them to the treaty. 3. The Prime Minister and his ministers, in spite of the reply contained in the second paragraph of your telegram No. 992 . r request most earnestly that the instrument be called a treaty of association (but not entente) and not alliance. If we feel limited /byi 4 • • • i 2 . by publicity given to the idea of an alliance - publicity in which it must be admitted that the Persian Government have not takenpart - they for their part have been subjected to violent attacks on the Berlin and Rome wireless which would not have occurred had the negotiations been * entirely confidential. The Persian Government are therefore making every attempt to obtain amendments which will allay the suspicions of the people. ■r * 4. We have drafted a number of amendments none of which, so far a^ I can see 5 has more than a face-saving value, except •the*promise of yund^ined credits in Article 7 which they seem to hope would be 1 © million but which I think should be 5 as .This replaces the suggestion for a * lo^n # o'f T‘ Mnion fcu%*forward • in my above-mentioned telegram. b* -After a further meeting to be held tomorrow I hope to telegraph in final form the amendments considered [grp. undec: ? reasonable.] • • [Repeated to Kuibyshev under Foreign Office No. 116 of 9th October].

I know how desirable it is to get the Treaty signed quickly,' if possible, but you will have seen from my tele gram No. 1050 that th ere are difficulties. I gather fTom the Minister ror Foreign Affairs that some of his colleagues are asking what Persia would get in exchange for joining [? against] Germany. I found the change of status, which I urged the alliance would bring about, did not impress the Prime Minister, who considers the Russians would continue to be unreasonable. The attitude of Turkey has great influence here, where there is a tendency to believe that if Persia joined Russia Turkey would draw nearer to the Axis. I do not say that these difficulties are insurmountable, but they are very great. 2. The Soviet Ambassador and I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs [ grp. undec. ] and I repeated verbally to the Prime Minister, that there are several matters which cannot wait if ihe conclusion of the Treaty is delayed, e.g. (a) establishment of British, Russian and Persian censorship, (b) closing of the French legation, (c) reception of official representative of the Czechoslovak Government, RECo.

Persian request for assurance that Persia will be represented‘at Peace Conference is probably based on assumption that peace settlement will be reached at a full Conference on lines 4 of Versailles. It is, however, impossible to say what procedure may be adopted, and it might be of little value to the Persians to tell them that they will be represented at 11 The Peace Conference 1 ’. . Vhat they really require, presumably, is assurance that they will have a voice in settling matters which are of interest to them. I suggest therefore that reply should take the form of quoting Article 6 , paragraph 1, of Treaty of Alliance, and continuing:- ■’I have been authorised by my Government to give Your Excellency an assurance that the provisions of this Article would apply to peace negotiations after the war, and that His Majesty’s Government are of the opinion that this treaty provision ensures that Persia will be represented in any negotiations directly affecting her interests. His Majesty's Government will in any case.net attempt to settle such matters without Persia's knowledge and consent.' • Please make communication on these lines if your Soviet colleague agrees.RLE COPY (op | SECRET FROM: PERSIA Sir R.

Soviet Ambassador told me on 13th October that his Government were in full accord with our proposed text for the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty and had no suggestions or amendments to make. Soviet Ambassador at Tehran had been so informed. 2. There was, however, one point which His Excellency would like to clear up with me. He understood that the reference in Article 3 (ii) (b) and Article A to movements of our respective forces and to the right of transit through Persia did not mean that we should move our troops about without consultation with each other, apart from any information we might give to the Persian Government. I said that, of course, there v/ould be the fullest consultation between us and I could assure him that we had no intention of making any important changes in the dispositions of our forces without consultation with the Soviet Government. The Ambassador said that this was also the position of his Government and that in order to put the matter on record he v/ould write me a letter to which I could reply.WG 446/7/5 CYPHJSR TKLKGI^AM MEDIUM DISTRIBUTION FROM DOMINIONS OFFIOK To tne Govomrn&amp;nt» of CANADA COMiMOBVEALTH OF AUSTRALIA IWl 2 ML.AND and to the United Kingdom HlgA Commissioner in the UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA (Sent 9 y 50 aonioj, 16th Octohoz* P 1941) M NOo 328 Secrete Following for Prime Minister,-.

Persian Treaty of Alliance] My telegram ^No.^ 835 [of October 5rd: proposed Anglo-Soviet- I v/rote to the Soviet Ambassador on October 4 th explaining that we have been considering to v/hat extent (if at all) we can meet the Persian Government's desire for the limitation of the areas occupied by the Allied forces and in particular their withdrawal from Tehran. While this would be one of the main advantages which the Persian Government would hope to obtain from the proposed Treaty we felt that no provision to this effect could be made in the Treaty itself, as we were sure the Soviet Government would agree that we could not restrict our freedom to station troops m any part of Persia in case of need. 2c Question however arises whether it would be desirable in practice to withdraw some of our troops from neighbourhood of Tehran on the conclusion of the Treaty. Since the presence of large numbers of Allied troops around Tehran necessarily weakens the Persian Government's authority and prejudices their efforts to maintain order, I suggested that the Allied Governments might well agree (subject to the views of the Allied commanders on the spot) to a substantial reduction in the number of Allied troops now at Tehran, or even perhaps to tbsir total withdrawal. I added that the Soviet Government might also consider the possibility of withdrawing their troops from Meshed as this town was not among the places which they originally proposed to occupy, and as its occupation does not appear to be essential for safeguarding the lines of communication by which supplies are being sent to the Soviet Union. 5. I asked M. Maisky to secure the views of his Government as a matter of great urgency.(k&gt; fi-t With tho Compfimonte of t h ^ Qf^ier Secretary of State for Fore 1^,0 Affairs -fiOCT 194’ 0lX*-4&gt; [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he re tained by the authorised recipient and not passed on]. recipion' [Cypher] W.hR CABINET D ISTRIBUTION.

This procedure, in v/hich Soviet Ambassador concurred after receiving Russian translation pf suitable draft from his Government, was unorthodox but it seemed most desirable that Persian Government should.know as soon as possible what was in contemplation especially as they probably did not expect such severe berms. What with prpssuro from Soviet troops on the north and ignoranceof Allies intentions/the Persian Government were in a condition of complete stagnation* 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs.has sounded one or two of his colleagues and ho says that in addition to the question of participation in Peace Conference, Persian Government would probably ask what economic assistance would be rendered and whether foreign troops could not be removed from the capital. I had not th^n received your telegram MAtyc No.835 but I said that it would be impossible to delay treaty negotiations while economic details were discussed as that would take too long and that as to troops, they had been sent here because of Persian Government s delay in dealing with the enemy missions and nationals and their removal was a military question, though I personally could see that Persian Government would find some advantage in having free space round Tehran. In any case I said that Allied governments would have to maintain their right to station troops in any part of Persia and that the question of withdrawal from the capital would have to be considered within that framework.OUTWARD TELEGRAM (\ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be kept under Lock and Key.] E 6129/3444/54 [Cypher] GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.

Your telegrams Nos. 867 and 877 [of September 27th and 29th: proposed Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of Alliance]. It is not possible, for the reasons stated in paragraph 5 of my telegram No. 801 [of September 26th], to insert in the draft Treaty any provision for the withdrawal of Allied troops from Tehran, or any provision which would limit our freedom to station troops in any part of Persia in case of need. The question whether we could in practice withdraw troops from Tehran and Meshed on the conclusion of the Treary, or at least reduce our troops at Tehran to a token force, is under urgent consideration. It is, however, doubtful whether His Majesty's Government wal from whether Soviet Government would agree. I recognise, however, that the immediate proximity of large numbers of Soviet troops has a paralysing effect on Persian administration, and that on these grounds substantial reduction may be very desirable. There is no objection to your discussing the question with your Soviet colleague provided that you make it clear that His Majesty's Government have not yet reached r decision. 2. I have suggested to Soviet Ambassador the , k addition of the words !f the economic life of the country' ;k in Article IV, in accordance with your proposal. 3. I am now suggesting to the Soviet Ambassador new wording of Article VII to read: 'The Allied Powers jointly undertake to use their best endeavours to safeguard the economic existence of the Persian people against the privations and difficulties arising as a result of the present war'. 4. Proposal to establish joint commission at Tehran to deal with matters arising out of occupation has already been put to Soviet Ambassador on two occasions. If Soviet Government agree, it will doubtless be possible to set up commission at once, and I am not sure that there^ gained by putting an article on the subject m tne ureaty* 5. I have also suggested to Soviet Ambassador that the Allied Governments should give the Persian Government an assi.ianoe, separate from the Treaty, but which could become known, that Persia will be represented at the Peace Conference see your telegram No. 861 [of September 27th].Ikr [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government Aw.

There is nothing in the terms of the draft Treaty cited in Foreign Office telegrams to Tehran Hos. 702/3 which singles out India for specific mention as separate Party to Treaty, As you are aware we wish to secure Indians interests in implementation of policy in Persia by means of representation in diplomatic and political field snd not by means of specific mention in formal Treaty. Although it is true that term of Treaty is to synchronise with war ana we have agreed that India's demand for substitution of ’'special arrangements in regard to her concern with Persia” should be subject to the same limitation, we anticipate that formal inclusion of India as separate party would raise difficult issues in widest constitutional fieM of external affairs. While therefore we greatly appreciate suggestion, we must strongly advise that Indians interest be secured by other means It is probably true that inclusion of India as parly «/ould appeal to some sections of Indian political opinion but we apprehend that it would also provide platform for conse: loation of opposition to H.M.Govt. ! s PerBla 31 ith f °; lrcles l or t!lis reason also ihere&lt;ore we advise against proposal.EXTHiiCT from GABII^IKT CONCLUSIONS 95(41) dated 22.^.41 .

(c) if the Shah became allied to the two great Powers would he not feel his position stronger than ever? 5. The occasion did not allow of long discussion but I said: (a) whatever Persia did now would make little difference if Germany won the war (three grps. undec (b) criticism of Russian behaviour me exaggerated and in any case behaviour to an ally would naturally be better than to an occupied country; (c) it was for the Persians, not for us, to [? give] the limits of their reforms: Majlis should lose no time m preparing the projected demands. 4.

Delivery of about 100 Germans to the Russians is most distasteful to them and while'I have had to refuse their appeals to me to reverse decision on this point, I realise the difficulty of their position dn’d should like them to have something to show for the support, which they have given to our policy. Separate telegram is'being sent about first batches of internees. (2) Opposition to the Shah grows stronger and more open and I do not think that any regime in which he forms part can secure general acceptance. Prime Minister says that everyone distrusts and fears the Shall who vail promise anything bui seizes the first opportunity to break his promise and penalise the persons concerned. In addition there is a general feeling especially amongst the young men that the country has lost face through the Shah and can only regain it if he goes. It is important the Persians should regain hope and self respect [ ?to some extent]. Removal of the Shah and proposed alliance would both have that effect, (3) Although I believe nothing will work if the Shah stays I shall most cautiously, if authorised, speak to the Prime Minister and Minister tor Foreign /iffairs, not to force any card upon them but to make it clear that the Persians must find a policy and carry it out. Prime Minister seemed to think that the Shah must go, that he would leave of his own free will if his policy was seriously criticised in our broadcasts and that any Cabinet in office could carry on if there was an interregnum^ I do not however give this as his final opinion.WNt) tha Compllmant* of the Under Secret ft rv of StfttP ^ fkct^- b'ffiVc, for For^i/rt A '.'air* 12 JUL1M5 [Cypher], DEPARTHBMTAL H0.1.

You ^ informed me that the Soviet Gov.ruffleat would be glad to receive the neoeeeary explanations on these ^ questions. I h»ve now made detailed enquiries into the mtu re raised in your memorandum, and I think 1 must eb^oede that queetlone of the moet suitable dlspoeltlon ' troope and aerodromes seem to have been dealt with h&lt;rto on a purely military basis by the loeal Itary authorities, though it has for long to-on the otlce for the Soviet Military ^ t* *ich4 in Tehran to informed in advance by the British Military Attaohd all important movements of Britisb forces in west His excellency Monsieur Jean Maisky. 'u ‘ersia,/['■ t «nd tfonth of pooltions oplglnully oocupiod by British troops. *t the sem^ time th«?re is one point In the flit isor«tnduia under reply to which I would draw attention. It is true that in August, 1041, preels* zones w«re notified to the ersian Ooversacnt ss toe sress frow which Persian forces should be withdrawn, but th* ststejueat that the places so specified would be occupied tt,»por«rily by Hritisfe end Jowiet forces did not necessarily imply that no British and Soviet forces would in esse of need be eta ioned elsewhere in rsis. Indeed, it wee v ry soon found neoessary by both the ioviet end the British authorities to atatioa troops »t certein pieces outside these sones. Btfore the 2i«t October, 1: 41, the date of the arrangemente regarding future consultation between our two Oovemts^nie on th* subject of troop ear events, the soviet authorities had found it necessary to establish a garrison at Meshed, outai&amp;e the iOvi&lt;.t sone, and the British authorities had slmllaiuy found it nucesasiy to establish garrisons at datteden, rak (^ultanabadj sad other places outside the original British zone. Thus the fact that there are now British garrisons stationed at Hamadan and Arak does not in itself denote any change from tha situation existing on the 31st October, 1941. Thk British military authorities in Persia have, as th«? soviet Oevemafteat are no doubt awar^, been entrusted with three mein tasks, namely: to protect the railway and ro*d comrmaaicaUons in order that the safety of the military supplies destined for the Soviet Union may be enaired while in transit northward from the i^rsien dulf* to take euoh measures as may be neeeasary for the defeaoe of the important oil areas in Bouth ^est Persia; and to be in a p sition, if neoesaary, to implement the undertakings assumed by His Majesty’s Government under Article 3 of the Treaty of &amp;XIlanes for the defence of Persia from aggression. All the measures taken hitherto by the British military authorities, both as regards the disposition of their troop* «nd »» regards the construction of military aerodroTi*s, have b«en undertaken with these ends in view, and more especially having in mind tha sll Important task of maintaining th&lt;&amp; ever-increasing flow of supplies destined for the Soviet Union without interruption/COPY 1178 (E 259/82/34) MKKORAMDUU &lt; By the joint note of the Soviet and British Governments of the 50th August, 1941, addressed to the Iranian government it was established that Soviet troops should temporarily occupy regions to the north of the line traversing the following points; locality • of Ushnuieh, Haiderabad, Miyanduab, Zinjan, Kazvin, Khurramabad, Babol, Zeerab, Samnan, Shahrud and Ali-abad‘; and the British troops should temporarily occupy the regions to the south and west of the line traversing the points Khanaqin, Kermanshah, Khurramabad, Meshed-i-Suliman, Khorast-kel, Gakhsarar}, Ramkhorkaz and Bandar-dilan. Thus, by the aforementioned note of the Soviet and British Governments, the zones’ of where Soviet and British troops in Iran should be stationed were precisely fixed. Later on during the negotiations of the draft Treaty of Alliance between the U.S.S.R., Great Britain and Iran, the Soviet- Government, through its Ambassador in London, Maisky, made, on the 14th October, 1941, a written communication to the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, that the right resulting from clause 4 of the Treaty (the right to maintain military forces on Iranian territory) should be used by mutual agreement between the Soviet and British Governments. In a letter of the 21st October, 1941, in reply to this communication Mr. Eden said that he was 'happy to confirm that 'His Majesty’s Government shares the view of the Soviet Government 'on this point and that we had no intention of making any changes in 'the disposition of our forces in Persia without consulting the 'Soviet Government.' In a supplementary letter of the 21st November, 1941, Mr. Eden explained that they did not, of course, suggest that either of the Governments should consult the other on every occasion when small bodies of troops may happen to be moved in the occupied parts of Persia,-but that they would be dealt with by the local commanders in the ordinary course of their duties. The Treaty of Alliance concluded on the 29th January, 1942, secured to the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain all these rights with regard to the control of Iranian communications and maintenance of troops in Iran, about the joint use of which a full understanding was already reached between the.Soviet and British Governments. During the period which followed the signature of the Treaty of Alliance there were no considerable changes or movements in the disposition of the Soviet troops occupying the zone of Iran assigned to them. On the other hand, during 1942, there occurred very important changes in - the disposition of the British troops on the territory of Iran, j g* Changes which go far beyond the despatch of small military bodies, and also very considerable changes in the location of British ■garrisons in Iran. British garrisons of the varied strength and , 0 numbers were stationed at points which far exceeded the borders of S the fcone fixed by the note of. August, 1941, as for instance, &lt; IZ .Sum |Arak, Hamadan, Zahidan^ jjfaBpp* In addition the/ SoviSt^Government received information that ^ ci the British authoriti es, pwith&amp;^any understanding being reached with the jboviet representative's^'sin are carrying out the construction Hpf^'vjarious military estab&gt;i'Bhmerit's, outside the zone which was assigned for British troops^to be stationed in Iran. For instance, v~&lt; In the regions of Zahidan,'zabola, Birjand, Hamadan, 50 kilometres to 'the south of Kazvin and at other points, the British authorities are o * constructing military aej^odromes and landing grounds.

'Sr.o. ///// Y our telegram No. 122 Saving [of 18th October: ratification of iinglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of Alliance]. Soviet Ambassador suggested to me recently that His Majesty’s Government should now ratify the Treaty of Alliance. On finding that the mistake in the Full Power sent to your Soviet colleague obliges them to ratify the Treaty, Soviet Government sire no doubt anxious that we should follow suit. 2. In my reply I reminded Soviet Ambassador that all concerned had agreed that the Treaty should not be subject to ratification, that it was approved by the Majlis before signature in order to avoid necessity for ratification by Persia, ana that Article 9 states that it comes into force on signature. But as your Soviet colleague's Full Power made the validity of his signature dependent on ratification by the Soviet Government, it seemed necessary that this should be done. Your Full Power, on the other hand, did not make the validity of your signature dependent on ratification by His Majesty, and in view of Article 9 of the Treaty it would be both superfluous and incorrect for His Majesty to ratify the Treaty now. If he were to do so, the Persian Government might suggest that the Treaty had not been in force hitherto. For these reasons His Majesty's Government would prefer not to deposit an instrument of ratification. The fact that the Treaty will have been ratified by the Soviet Government and not by His Majesty’s Government would in the circumstances in no way affect its validity.

The most urgent questions were settled by Financial Agreement t»f 26th May. As regards the remainder we have felt hitherto that in principle it may be best to postpone any attempt to negotiate formal agreements in cases where present arrangements are already working smoothly and efficiently. It may prove difficult to induce Persian Government to agree in wilting to terms as favourable as those in which they now acquiesce in practice. Once we embark on negotiations, all kinds of unforeseen difficulties may be raised which might never have arisen had we been content to leave well alone. Our view therefore is that we should only formulate proposals for inter-Governmental agreements in oases where we stand to gain some definite advantage by concluding an agreement, or where the absence of an agreement may cause us serious trouble later. If Soviet Government or Persian Government wish to press for agreements in cases where we are less interested, we can leave it to them to formulate definite proposals. 2. Position has now been further complicated by the proposal that the Americans should take over operation and maintenance of railways and possibly also ports and roads. This will clearly affect the negotiation of agreements oetween the Persian Government the Soviet Government and ourselves on these questions. The draft agreement regarding railways enclosed in your despatch No. 282 [of 24th August] is being considered here, but will probably need modification in the light of future developments. Meanwhile please report in detail what financial arrangements are at present m force in respect of railways, roads, ports and aerodromes. Report should show: (a) Charges now being paid by British authorities for use of railways, roads, ports and aerodromes. (b) Any arrangements whereby cost of capital improvements and material supplied by us is refunded to British authorities. 3. Agreement regarding aircraft factory has been dealt with separately, see my telegram No. 955 of 18th June.9 + 2 , 4. As regards war damage compensation, His Majesty's Government have already refused, during the negotiations for the Treaty of Alliance, to consider any payment for damage caused at the time of the Allied occupation. They have similarly refused to agree to any payment for damage ru' lc ^ e( ^ duri ?g military operations in Syria and the Lebanon._ It is realised that the Persian Government may again raise this question, but His Majesty's Government are most unlikely to modify their attitude. As regards other claims, it isthe practice of the British forces to entertain claims for damage, other than v/ar damage, against the amy of occupation, and to settle them on their own merits, so that it seems doubtful whether any formal agreement on this point is required. 5. As regards immunities, please consult Commander-in- Ghief whether, m the light of paragraph 1 . above, it is desirable to draw up proposals for a formal agreement. If so, he could be asked to produce a draft, which snould be based on the position in Iraq and Egypt, for consideration by you and m London. 6 . The central problem is how to obtain a contribution from the Persian Government towards the cost of works carried out bv the Allies, and it is important that we should be clear how this problem is to be tackled before we negotiate agreements in respect of railways, ports, roads and aerodromes. The expedient suggested in paragraoh 2 of your despatch No. # 92 [of 24th March] is no longer practicable. But we think it important that any financial arrangements we make should safeguard our power to obtain payment from the Persian Government within their capacity to pay. The longer the war lasts the more sterling xhe Persians will have and the mpre the Persian Government can reasonably be asked to pay, since they must, for reasons given in my telegram No. 12 Saving [of.the 25th June] get much of these funds out u ?P- Va ^ e hands into their own. Please consider therefore whether there is any alternative proposal which would meet this requirement. Could the Persian Government, for instance, be induced to agree to set aside half yearly, when they convert 40$ of their sterling balance into gold, some smaller percentage of these Balances towards paying for assets 'necessary for the needs of Persia'? 7. Failing this, we favour some arrangement on the following lines We would ask the Persian Government to agree now to the terms which would operate in the case of any transfers which may be agreed upon subsequently. The effect of this I 36 that nothing could be taken over by the Persians without their being liable to make payments to us in accordance with the agreed principles. The terms which we think should apply are as follows: (a) that the Persian Government should have an optionfor a limited time after the end of hostilities, to take over, at cost less depreciation or at a valuation, buildings and facilities which axe the property ®f H is Majesty's Government; / (b)5. ^ (b) if this option is not exercised, His Majesty^. Government would have the right to sell, &lt;pr failing that to salvage the buildings and facilities; (c) the Persian Government would undertake to afford His Majesty^ Government all facilities they may require for the disposal to a third party of any buildings and facilities which they did not wish to acquire themselves, 8 * I agree that, so far as Soviet participation is concerned, each case should be treated on its merits# But we shall have to keep Soviet Government informed of our general intentions and, in cases where they are to be co-signatories, agree with them on the line to be adopted before approaching the Persians. 9. We are, as you know, also committed to consulting the United States Government before entering intoany agreement involving disposal of lease-lend material. Since in practice it would be virtually impossible to assess the exact proportion of lease-lend material that has gone into any given improvement, the only practical way to deal with this question will be to reach a general understanding with the United States Government before we approach the Persians. The way will be clearer for doing this when we have received your recommendations regarding paragraphs 6 and 7 above.

Except in case of Shahbaz aircraft factorv no arrangements have been made for payment of rent and the Persian Government is pressing that we should either evacuate building and allow them to revert to their normal use or agree to pay a fair rental. e 3. It seems to me difficult to sustain the contention that we should occupy Persian Government buildings rent free where we disturb an activity actually being carried out. Unless such a policy wpuld create embarrassment for you elsewhere, I recommend that in such cases normal procedure should be that we assura - e that the verv fact of our occupation entails additional expense to the Persian Government and that we should accept responsibility for payment of rent without requiring the Persian Government to renew the amount of added expense to which they have been put. Each case would be treated on its merits. We should however expect to receive rent free Government owned vacant land and buildings. 4.

In any case 2 ma not quite clear what the policy would be if the agreements were not made retrospective* 5 * The niain lone of contention is q.ite olviously^^ the treatment of any transfers after tne war to the Persian Government of buildings and facilities erected on their soil by the Allies* ic have considered this from our departmental point of view, but it appears to us that before we can go very far on this subject there is a iiiajor political question which will have to be thought out and decided* The point is t *at at tue end of this wdr, whilst we may naye a number of installations in Persia and other seid-dependont countries for the transfer of which wo should normally seek some payment when, as we expect, they come to be handed over to those Governments, we ourselves shall have a number of installations on our‘territory which have been erected partly or wholly at the expense of the united States of America* Me presumably hope to reach an agree^nt with the uaericans which will not be unduly onerous to ourselves* It may be, therefore, that we should ourselves i&gt;et a good example by refraining from asking the Persian Govenxa*ent to pay for tne value of transferred buildings, in the expectation that the ricans will be equally generous financially to us* At least it might be desirable for us to hold our nands with regard to the financial conditions to be imposed in the case of any of these px*oposed transfers to ersia, etc* until we know how the Americana are likely to treat us* On the other aide it may be arg ed tnat our relations with Iersia are somewhat different from those 01 t .e U*S*A. with us and that, in any case, we shall not be doing much harm in risking an American request to pay for the value of installations erected partly or wholly at their ex enae 1£ we want tne.a* The foriaer considerations suggest a policy of inactivity for the present but we feel that it is not within the com etence of the ^ar Office to jud e whether or not this Is the proper policy; from a purely departmental t * &gt;• point/mm m point ol view we deprecate it* v e aesuirie that you will discuss this with the Treasury* 6 * &lt;e have, however, (ignoring for the mmont the considerations propourided in the preceding para^ra^h) considered what should be the departinental ar Office attitude as regards these possible transfers to Persia of our facilities* ie foresee great difficulty in reac ting an ^l^itable anangei ent with the Pez*sian (jovem ent if we delay t otiations until after the war, by which time our forces wxxl probably have been withdrawn from Persia, thus roiaoving a practical lever to press our tome* There appear to be three suggested solutions apart from that oi Iliff which has now been rendered impracticable by the new arrange ents regarding rates of exchsuige* These solutions, and our views on them are as follows:~ (i) t«e ignt toil the Persians now that we are prepared to let them have our facilities erected in Persia at the end of the war on tne understanding tnat th?y i/iake current paytr^nts to us during the war* &lt;e are by no iueans ena^noured of this suggestion since we o^mot be sure that Persia will in fact pay us anything during the war: they may sit tight as the Egyptian Goy&lt; mi/ient has been doing with conspicuous success feeling certain that they will have the facilities at the end of the war In accordance with our conditional tern, but without attempting to pay the wartime contributions which should in theory condition tae transfer* we fear in^ fact chat we should hand over the substance now for possible, contributions w tich wil l never materialise* oreover we cannot foresee at this stage the extent of our capital assets in lersia at the eid of the war* It would be difficult to determine now how iaucn the e rrent payrnen should be, unless it was a rising figure increasing proportionately to the value of the assets* Ail) e should now a&amp;K the Persian Government uo agree to the terms which will operate in the case of any transfer being agreed subsequently* T iere ip a lot to be said for this from the purely financial point of view since it would mean that nothing could be talcen over by the lersians without their being liable to malce payments to us in accordance with the principles/principles taereby agreed* should apply are as follows: The ter s which we think v (a) that tae Pareian Government should have an 4 option for a limited time to take over buildings and facilities, the property of the British Government, after the termination of hostilities either at coat leas depreciation or at a valuation; OPNGH &gt;*§£ y i A, sf '/ * (b) if this option were not exercised tae British Government'would have the right to sell, or falling that, to salvage tae buildings and facilities; (c&gt; the Persian Government would undertake, in the event of its not desiring to buy the buildings, to afford facilities for the British Government to acquire the land on which they stand, if this is desired, at favourable than those on which Government coall acquire it* be necessary to obtain general to the terms on which the Pers should hand over to us in such which is Peipsi an Government pr (ill) tie might (as /ilcox has suggests question of Persian payment to us w|th payment by us to the Persian compensation for any danage done t property* It is for consideratio add this as a collateral condition (cj of (ii) above* If it is decided on high politic is not necessary to adjust our policy to P so as to take account of repercussions on the United States, we think that we should Persians on the basis of (ii) (and possibl 7 * e have-not gone into the quest!

I pointed out that as far as we were concerned there would be no ratification and that the treaty was in force in any case, but for the above reasons the Persian representative pressed for retention of their text and it was signed in triplicate by the signatories of the treaty. 2.

In view of your telegram I agree that wording needs alteration and I should be grateful for instructions as to whether I should suggest^its cancellation to the Persian Government -and the Soviet Ambassador on the grounds mentioned in paragraph 1 of your telegram under reference.

PersTan'TreafyoF Alliance You r despatch^No. 52 rof 1st February: Anglo-Soviet- The Proces-Verbal of Signature, of whose existence we were unaware, is open to objection for two reasons: (a) It describes the Treaty of Alliance as between the three Governments concerned, whereas the three parties are the Heads of States set out in the preamble. 7e make a distinction between a Treaty between Heads of States and one between Governments, which involves inter alia different kinds of Full Powers. Moreover, it is quite incorrect to describe His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom as i! His Britannic Majesty's Government 15 in such a document. (b) A more serious difficulty is the reference to the exchange of instruments of ratification. It is specifical ly laid down in Article 9 that the Treaty comes into force on signature, and we have no intention of ratifying it. You will recall that Article 9 was deliberately drafted with this end in view, while the whole point of submitting the Treaty to the Majlis before signature was to avoid the necessity for ratification. It is not clear whether Proc&amp;s-Verbal was signed by the signatories of the Treaty or whether it is intended to have any legal validity. But if it is considered to affect the rest or the Treaty in any way, it seems essential that it should either be cancelled or else revised and re-signed.

V ^zV R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—[Received January 7, 1942.) January 7, 1942. ^ i**. &lt;[y 6^-^ «p(L Copy No. Qg No. ir, 211 .) uOa/t Tehran, December 20, ^ I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a note made by military attache to His Majesty’s Legation after an interview with His Maj the Shah. Major-General Fraser received an invitation to call on the Shah wit the Minister for War, but when they appeared together the Shah dismissed the Minister for W ar and had a private talk with the military attache. 2. I he Shah bears little resemblance to his father in character, but he shares with him a deep interest in the Persian army—an interest fostered by service in the army for two or three years. In my despatch No. 1 47 of the 9th October I reported that at my first audience'with the Shah k l the main feature of the conversation was His Majesty's preoccupation with the army and his illusions as to its value and to the role it could play in the present war.” In a telegram based on the same interview I had reported that His Majesty talked quite seriously about helping us with an army of 300.000 or 400,000 men. In subsequent talks with myself and others the Shah has shown a keener sense of proportion, but the interest he takes in the army has always been obvious, and in the interview recorded in the enclosure to the present despatch he has treated the subject with some wisdom. It will be remembered that the Cabinet objected to the provision about the Persian army in the original draft of the treaty of alliance, and asked that the role of the army should be limited to the maintenance of internal security; and that the Foreign Office, while they accepted the proposal, expressed surprise that the Persian Government could make the humiliating proposal that the Persian army should not defend its territory in case of a German invasion. A few days before the treaty was initialled the Minister for Foreign Affairs reopened the subject, and asked me what the Allies would be prepared to do (in the way of supplying arms and equipment) if the Persian Government accepted the original draft of the treaty : there were some members of the Cabinet who thought that the maintenance of internal security was a mean task for an army, and regretted their request for the limitation of the Persian army to that role. I said that it was late in the day to reopen this question, which had been settled in the way the Cabinet had desired, and that the conclusion of the treaty could certainly not be delayed while so difficult a question as equipment, &amp;c., for the Persian army was discussed. In any case. I said, unless I could be assured that the request came from the Government I could not take any official notice of it. M. Soheily never referred to it again, and I now realise that he was speaking for the Shah, whose man he is, rather than for the Cabinet who would hardly dare to insert in the treaty any provision which required the Persian army to take part in any circumstances in a foreign war. The Shah is wrong if he believes that his people share his opinion about the role of the army, but he is right in thinking that the morale of the army needs to be raised, even for the purpose of maintaining public security, and that it would not be raised unless the army felt that it had a part to play in the defence of Persia. Unfortunately, the morale of the army is so low that to raise it would require more than the prospect of helping to defend Persia against a foreign enemy, while general political considerations preclude the insertion of any such provision in the treaty. 3. The Shah mentioned to Major-General Fraser a point on which I was sure that he had strong feelings, though he had refrained, doubtless out of politeness, from mentioning it to me, viz., the fact that the British attacked Persia without warning. He had spoken to me with indignation on one occasion of the unheralded Russian attack, and I could see by the way in which he steered away from the subject that this ugly cap fitted His Majesty’s Government also. It is well to remember that, however great the material gain we may obtain from 126—9] RECd. POL. LZPt. 13 FEB 942 INDIA OFFICE2 the Allied occupation, the manner in which it was effected is not to be easily distinguished by Persians from the “ treachery ” of the attacks without warning effected by the Germans and the Japanese; and that consequently one of the moral arguments on which we build our case against the Axis and its associates carries little or no weight in this country. 4. All foreigners, whether official or not. who have an opportunity to talk with the Shah, come away with a good impression. Even the Soviet Ambassador seems to consider him a sensible young man. He has the merit which not all his Ministers share, of having decided definitely to side with the Allies whatever happens. With one or two exceptions, Persians who side with the Allies convey an impression that, if they have burnt their boats, they have retained, for use in an emergency, a small but serviceable dinghy. I have. &amp;c. (For the Minister), E. E. CROWE. P.S.—I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Angora, Bagdad, Cairo and Kuibyshev, and to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the External Affairs Department. E. E. C. Enclosure. Interview vrith the Shnh, December' 8, 1941. THE Shah said the treaty would be signed in a few days He then hoped to bring about a much more intimate collaboration. They had been ineffective hitherto in presenting the treaty in a favourable light to the country, but they were not experts in propaganda. Would we help? He took exception to the recent Times article which had seemed to say that British diplomacy had been weak in pot forcing the treaty through more rapidly, and that the Persians were hanging back waiting on events in Russia. He thought that was the wrong line for us to take; it was a mistake for us to stress Persian hesitation; that was merely giving the Germans material for propaganda. Rather should we stress our community of interests, our interest in the preservation of Persian independence, our desire to see Persia strong. Neutrality was not possible nowadays. Persia was throwing in her lot with us, and he would do his best to convince the country that that was in Persia’s interest. He would try to give the country the clear policy that was so evidently peeded. It was essential to restore morale in the army; to do that it was essential that the army should feel that it had a part to play in the defence of Persia and not merely to stand aside and look on if the Germans reached Persia. It must be inspired with a determination to defend Persia against the Axis. That was essential if morale was to be restored. And unless it was restored the army would be useless even for internal security. We could help by propaganda to the effect that although Persia now needed a small army in virtue of the alliance, it was essential that that army should be efficient not only for present needs, but with a view to expansion after the war. We could help, too, by suggesting in our propa ganda that we appreciated the wisdom of the order to the Persian army to cease resistance as being in the best interest of Persia. He much regretted the course events had taken. He felt sure that we could have had all we wanted in this country without launching a sudden attack and without bringing the Russians in if it had ever been made clear to his father what it was we wanted and that we meant to have it. His father “ attendait un geste de votre part.' To present a note at 4 a.m. and at the same time launch an unannounced attack was not what they had expected from us. But all that must be forgotten if we were to achieve anything now. (In spite of this praise worthy sentiment, he reverted to it several times. It obviously rankles.) He hoped! that when the treaty was signed we would do something effective to convince the Kurds that we were entirely out of sympathy with their attempt to throw off the Persian yoke. He knew some Kurds had legitimate grievances and3 \ he had given orders that these should be redressed. But he still seemed to suspect that some encouragement was being given to the Kurds from the Iraqi side. He referred vaguely once or twice to an “ accord militaire.” He has some thing in mind. Comment. 1 was impressed by the Shah, who struck me as being straightforward, reason able and simple. He is obviously greatly feeling the humiliation of his army, with which he associates himself closely. There is something in what he says about the need to inspire the army with a determination to defend Persian soil if the enemy should reach it. It will lead, of course to demands for certain equipment of which they are deficient, and' I don’t know whether it is in the power of the Shah and the Government to make such inspiration effective, but it would be of great value to us if we could rely on the Persian army to defend aerodromes, &amp;c., against parachute troops. The Shah says the signing of the treaty is going to make a great difference. The country will then be definitely committed. He was, I thought, a little pathetic in his appeal for help. (Signed) W. A.

He said that the text of the treaty had been obtained in Tehran only when the United States Minister was instructed to ask for it, and that the United States Embassy in London had also only obtained the•information when they pressed for it. 2r.
