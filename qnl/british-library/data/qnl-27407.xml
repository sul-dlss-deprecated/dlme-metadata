WITH reference to Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 446 o f the 4th December last, I have the honour to report that I have now learnt from His Majesty’s consul for Khuzistan that the rebel Bahmai chieftain, together with a number of his relatives and followers, has at last surrendered. The reason appears to be that the locally engaged militia, backed by the military, hunted the rebels from mountain to mountain, inflicting losses, and finally captured Khoda Karam Khan’s chief wife. By this vigorous pursuit the rebels’ morale was crushed and all is now reported quiet in Kuhgilu. 2. On the orders of Tehran, Khoda Karam Khan and his intimate followers, to the number of about seventy, were shot, photographs being taken before and after the execution. The military plundered the outlaws’ camp and No. 13 regiment arrived back in Ahwaz laden with loot. It is stated that various Bahmai prisoners in Ahwaz are to be settled at Ahu Dasht. 3.

A summary of the leaflet forwarded by Mr. Gardener is also enclosed. 2. Since Mr. Gardener’s report was written, the situation has not changed appreciably. Early in November His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz reported that the Behbahan and Ardakhan, both of which were said to have been attacked, were then reported by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to be quiet. The military authorities had ceased by that date to commandeer civil transport in Shiraz. On the 20th November, Mr. Gardener telegraphed that there were no developments to report, and that the tribesmen were still quietly besieged. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, No. 223. I have., &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR. Enclosure 1. Consul Gardener to Mr. Seymour. (No. 87. Confidential.) Sir, Ahwaz, October 15, 1937. AS reported in correspondence ending with my letter of the 10th June last, the Iranian Government having decided to disarm and bring under control the Bahmai tribe of the Kuhgilu, a military force of some 600 men was despatched from Ahwaz and based on Behbahan. There they were placed under Sarhang Saqafi, the Military Governor of Behbahan. There is no information as to whether other troops were sent from the Shiraz or other commands. 2. The information detailed below is believed to be correct, but owing to the great difficulty of getting reliable information no guarantee of accuracy can be given. 3. The plan of campaign seems to have been to exercise such pressure on the tribe as to secure the submission of their leader, Khoda Karam, who had been declared an outlaw, the surrender of arms and ammunition and the general pacification of the tribesmen without bloodshed. 4. True to their traditional strategy, the tribes withdrew from the south in a north-westerly direction towards their fortress, called Qaleh Ala, and a nearby mountain, named Kuh-i-Mungasht. These two are situated about 6 miles apart in a district about 40 miles to the east of Ram Hormuz and Haft Kel. In their retreat the tribesmen were followed by the military detachment, but no engage ment took place. Instead, a nephew of Khoda Karam with some fifty followers surrendered to the military and were enrolled as irregulars and armed. 5 When Qaleh Ala was reached, it was found to be unoccupied by the Bahmai and Sarhang Saqafi ordered its demolition. This was a blunder as it seemed obvious that the Bahmai would congregate on Kuh-i-Mungasht, roughi) 6 miles to the east, in which event it would have been useful as a centre tor the r 180 u—4]_r . vr Af tViic? noint Khoda Karam became despondent and sought tomake terms Hetnt his wife and children to the troops offering the submission of his 'the surrender of all arms and obedience to all Government o d thp matter of conscription, payment of revenue, &amp;c. _ In return He asi ed to be allowed to remain free to live in the mountains, promising to be peaceful This o“as communicated to Ahwaz by the officer-in-charge of the garrison Sultan Qabrlani, but the command headquarters possibly after ^en c e /o Mmn refused these terms and ordered the arrest of Khoda Karam, by force if necessary. His wife and children, who had been well treated by the military, were then allowed to go back to Khoda Karam. , ,r -i•, 6. Determined to resist, Khoda Karam organised an attack on the military which began at 3 a.m. on the night of the 19th September and lasted f or about forty-eight hours. In this he was apparently aided by the Bahmai who had been enrolled as irregulars. The attack which started at first as a hand-to-hand struggle was partly successful, the Military Governor of Behbahan being killed while some four other officers and about sixty other ranks were killed or wounded. In addition rifles, ammunition and one machine gun were captured and Sultan v^ahiemam and a few other ranks were taken prisoner. These prisoners subsequently escaped in a later skirmish though they were well treated when in captivity, the losses sustained by the tribesmen do not appear to have been serious, owing to the successful use of surprise. The military machine-gunners seem to have caused most casualties. The tribesmen’s plan was to surround the military and exterminate them, but the tribesmen were ignorant of the powers of the machine gun and so the plan failed. The military remained and the tribesmen withdrew to Mungasht. Actually, the Iranian military were greatly outnumbered and seem to have fought well. 9 7. This partial reverse suffered by the Iranian arms made a profound impression on the military. General Muiny returned by air from Tehran, although according to local report he was doing the course for general officers organised by the French Military Mission. Arrangements were made to send in troops from Khorramabad and Dizful (garrisons in the Khuzistan command) and from Shiraz—the plan being to concentrate on Kuh-i-Mungasht from various directions and to beleaguer it. General Muiny withdrew the cavalry and mountain gun sections of the original force^—declaring them to be unsuitable for the terrain. It is said that the total military strength now employed in the area amounts to some 8,000 men, though no reliance can be placed on this figure. To get the Ahwaz force into position lorries and taxi-cabs were commandeered for several days. It is further stated that four light tanks have been sent to the area. An interesting reinforcement was the despatch of about sixty young officers who were undergoing training in Tehran. 8. As already stated, the plan of the Bahmai to surround the military and exterminate them having failed, they fled to the Kuh-i-Mungasht. Here the military were unable to follow them owing to the disorganisation of battle, the sma mess of the available force and extreme difficulties of the terrain. 9. JNevertheless, while reinforcements were being brought in, the air arm was employed. For some days the eight aeroplanes stationed in Ahwaz went ai u °q?

Notice to all Villagers and Inhabitants of the Bahmai Tribe. AS is generally known, Khoda Karam, of Bahmai, has gathered together a number of villagers and committed an outrage against the military forces at Qaleh Ala (though few in number, those forces behaved with great courage and were able to defend themselves). Therefore, Khoda Karam will shortly be pursued, severely punished and the cause of trouble will be removed. The Government had no intention of taking any action against the Khoda Karam and people like him, but Khoda Karam abused their lenient attitude and so made it necessary for the Government to gather their forces against him to show their authority. Khoda Karam has shown himself to be a rebel and any persons who associate themselves with him will also be considered rebels. If, on the other hand, they surrender their arms, they will be granted full security and allowed to continue their occupations as hitherto. They should be careful not to be deceived by Khoda Karam and should take the opportunity of this offer to separate themselves immediately from him and surrender their arms as soon as they encounter the soldiers who are pursuing them. They should also be careful not to sacrifice themselves for Khoda Karam’s cause, for they must know that every villager has got to submit to the Government’s authority, otherwise he will bring punishment on himself and will regret it ever afterwards.V-.

[E 6259/904/34] Copy No. Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—(Received October 25.) (No. 380.) Sir, Tehran, October 8, 1937. I HAVE the honour to inform you that recent telegraphic reports from His Majesty’s consular officers at Shiraz and Khorramshahr indicate that tribal discontent in the south is beginning once again to take active form. 2. It had been reported in the early summer that troops had been moved into the area north-west of Behbehan and east of Ram Hormuz occupied by the Bahmai sub-tribe of the Kuhgilu; little resistance was encountered, a number of prisoners were brought into Ahwaz, some rifles and ammunition were confiscated, and by the middle of July the expedition’s active work was thought to have been completed, although the troops were not with drawn. 3. On the 25th and 27th September, however, His Majesty’s vice-consul at Khorramshahr reported unconfirmed rumours to the effect that tribesmen had raided Behbehan, killing the Governor, and that the troops had suffered severely. While particulars are not available, it seems to be confirmed that the troops had in fact suffered a reverse and that wounded have been arriving in Ahwaz. Although some time must elapse before the details of the rising become known, it is clear that the reported submission of the Bahmais earlier in the summer can have been nominal only, and that they must be in possession of considerable quantities of arms. The situation must be a cause of some anxiety to the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company as one of their new oil-fields is situated not far from Behbehan. 4. It appears from a report from His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz that at the same time the Bahmais were rising on the eastern side of the Kuhgilu district, the Boir Ahmedi sub-tribe were engaging troops in the Western Kuhgilu; they are reported to have inflicted a reverse on the troops, who are being hastily rein forced from Shiraz. There are also rumours, unconfirmed as yet, current in Tehran that the trouble has spread from the Kuhgilu to other southern tribes, and that Khamseh tribesmen have been attacking road-guard posts in the neighbour hood of Ear. 5. I shall not fail to inform you of further developments. 6.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of two interesting despatches which I have received from His Majesty’s consuls at Ahwaz and Shiraz describing the recent visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to these two towns. 2. The contrast between the interest displayed by His Imperial Majesty in the activities and welfare of the people of Khuzistan and his comparative indifference towards the people of Shiraz seems to bear out Mr. Watkinson’s view that his neglect of the latter was deliberate. 3. It is perhaps of interest to note that throughout the tour the Crown Prince appears to have been kept to some extent in the background, though it is true that in Khuzistan His Imperial Majesty was evidently at some pains to familiarise him with various points concerning the administration of the empire. 4. One further point of interest to which I would draw your attention is the continued high esteem in which General Muiny appears to be held by the Shah. General Muiny was mentioned in the second paragraph of Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 468 of the 12th October last, and further particulars concerning him were given in the Iranian personalities recently forwarded from this Legation (see my despatch No. 112 of the 26th March, 1937). There can be little doubt that he is at the present moment one of the outstanding military commanders in the country. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s consuls at Ahwaz (No. 25) and Shiraz (No. 11) respectively. I have, &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR. Enclosure 1. Consul Gardener to Mr. Seymour. (No. 32.) Sir, Ahwaz, March 25, 1937. I HAVE the honour to append a statement showing the itinerary of His Imperial Majesty the Shah during his recent visit to Khuzistan, together with a list of his suite.Q As the Shah’s visit to this province was in the main a visit of inspection, it would, I think, be more convenient to report his views on each Government department, institution or individual. General. His Imperial Majesty appeared throughout to be in an unusually good mood, and showed very few signs of irritation. He appeared on arrival to be in good health and happy to be in Khuzistan. After his return from Khorramshahr and Bandar Shahpur he seemed tired, though he continued to be in a good temper. Throughout he drew the attention of the Crown Prince to every point of interest and discussed matters with him. Part of his mission was undoubtedly to familiarise his son with his future empire. As regards the people of the province, I could discover no signs of any real enthusiasm roused by the Shah’s presence. Neither, on the other hand, could one detect any hostility to the Shah. The crowds which congregated to see him were of moderate dimensions, neither large nor small. Many people took advantage of his presence (as related below) to present petitions. ( 1 ) Not printed.Pi ml During to visit ^TfdeS evidence 8 tha^special arrangements were made to suppiy htm wtth the day’ s foreign news dunng toone mg has e o ^“ eral 0 s i ons shown his solicitude for his people For instance, he stopped several times on the journey rom Khorramabad and Salehabad and talked to the tribesmen who have been settled rathe land there. In each case he asked if their lives were not now better than formerly when they were nomads. Similarly, he assured the Arab and Bakhtiari tribesmen settled on the Shahur (Shahpur) dam that they would be given free land and would be looked after. and would be looked alter. j ^ ^ qi. i, i • , • , u , All the telegrams of congratulation addressed to tbe onaii on his bnthdciy ‘ forwarded &amp; to Ahwaz. It is reported that he received telegrams from the ouvereigns or Presidents, Foreign Ministers, &amp;c., of nearly every country m the world, and was delighted to get them. ' , At the small New Year’s Day reception at Bandar bhahpur the Shah distributed in all about 100 gold half-Pahlavi pieces. Anglo-Irania/n Oil Company. Mr. Elkington, the general manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, accompanied by Mr. Clegg, came up from Abadan to Ahwaz to greet His Imperial Majesty on his arrival here. They and the manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran (who, unfortunately, was not present) were the only Europeans invited, and they were given a place of honour at the railway station. Everyone of importance was presented to the Shah, who acknowledged the presentation with a bow or a nod only. In the case of Messrs. Elkington and Clegg, however, the Shah stopped and said that he knew them and was glad to see them. During the whole of the Shah’s visit there were continual rumours that he would visit Fields and Abadan. Actually, he visited none of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s areas. I can advance no theory to account for this abstention, which is ail the more extraordinary as His Royal Highness the Crown Prince has not, I understand, seen any of the company’s work, though the Shah himself has visited both Fields and Abadan on former visits. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, at the request of General Muiny and the Governor-General, co-operated whole-heartedly in the preparations for the Shah’s visit. I understand they lent the municipality lorries, and gave them oil for road making, in addition to ensuring that the town electric supply was adequate. The company also sent about forty tents to Hindij an for the use of the Shah on his journey to Bushire. Military.

His Imperial Majesty inspected the Iranian navy at Khorramshahr and travelled from that port to Bandar Shahpur on a naval sloop. During the inspection at Khorramshahr, one Yawar was deprived of his rank by the Shah and apparently imprisoned. His offence apparently consisted in not' reporting the strength of his command, &amp;c., in the regulation manner to the Shah. The Yawar apparently belonged to General Muiny’s command, for the general requested the Crown Prince to approach the Shah with a view to a pardon being granted. This Yawar was pardoned on the day His Imperial Majesty left Khuzistan. Two incidents lead to the supposition that Sarhang Bayendor may not be very popular with the Shah. During the degradation scene mentioned above, the Shah pushed Bayendor violently in the chest. Furthermore, the Shah asked him how it was that the navy struck and killed people. This was a reference to the various instances of bad conduct of naval men, which had doubtless been reported to the Shah. These two incidents are not, unfortunately, sufficiently serious to lead to the hope that Sarhang Bayendor may be relieved of his command. Customs Administration. The Shah would seem to be aware of the congestion in the customs and of the inefficiency of that department. When the various officials were presented to him at Khorramshahr, he shook his head sadly at the mention of the name of the Director of Customs, and said : “ The Customs make extraordinary mistakes.” Bandar Shahpur. When at Khorramshahr the Shah asked why such quantities of goods were imported through Khorramshahr and not through Bandar Shahpur. He was informed that the latter port had not the necessary facilities. There is, however, a rumour that when the Shah returns to Tehran he will order some portion of the traffic to be diverted from Khorramshahr to Bandar Shahpur. When he visited Bandar Shahpur, he discussed the port with Aqa Mushar, head of the Southern Railways. It is stated (but no proof is at present available) that the Shah ordered Mushar to extend the existing jetty to a total length of 300 metres and to construct adequate warehouses so that merchandise should not be damaged. It is stated that the Shah was very insistent on the latter point. In regard to the main scheme of urbanisation, &amp;c., at Bandar Shahpur, it is stated that the Shah has come to no decision, but will study the project in Tehran, in view of the great expenditure involved. Railway and Roads. At first, His Imperial Majesty was not too pleased with the railway, but he revised this opinion and towards the end of his visit expressed his pleasure thereat. It is stated that the Shah considered the road from Khorramabad to Sale- habad dangerous and ordered steps to be taken to remedy this. It is also stated that he has ordered a road to be constructed from Ahwaz to Malamir. ag the^ al Ma$ z. Bd For ^ to hi®!: to'T the sk al ^ ortioi r in ^ 1 revif' 5 obSf; p r Education. The Shah during his visit gave proof of his interest in education. In every town he visited the school-children were paraded to see him, and these parades gave him great pleasure. In Ahwaz he inspected the new high school and was pleased. He seems pleased with the work of the Director of Education for Khuzistan. Agricidtural Department. This seems to be the one department with which the Shah is displeased. Aqa Fikrat, the Provincial Director of Agriculture, is under orders to go. Apparent!}' the grievance is that only 1,350 tons of uncleaned cotton were grown on an average of 7,000 hectares, while the expenses of the department were very heavy. The Shah accused the department of inefficiency, while the director attempted to excuse himself by saying that the seed was diseased. The Shah retaliated by asking why the Iranian technical men trained in Europe had not been used to examine the seed. [15 bb—1] B 2222BSBB The strength of tho dopiirtiiiGnt is being considornbly reduced because the Crown lands are, on the Shah’s orders, to be handed over to the Finance Depart ment for early distribution to cultivators. The Shah has ordered that within five years 25,000 hectares of land should be devoted to the cultivation of cotton in Khuzistan. Ahwaz Spinning Mill. The board of the Ahwaz mill petitioned the Shah for cheaper cotton, arguing that the mill here worked at a considerable disadvantage because the cotton had to be imported largely from the north, while the finished yarn had to be sent north for sale. The cost of transport made the Ahwaz mill’s products very expensive. In reply, the Shah said that the supply of local-grown cotton would soon be sufficient. The Shah added that the company should import a weaving plant, in order to avoid the necessity of sending the yarn north. The Shah expressed pleasure at the mill in Ahwaz, and was informed that the spinning plant was the product of a British firm (Messrs. Platt). Various. The Shah visited the French Archaeological Mission at Shush, and is reported to have shown annoyance at their work, complaining that they worked too slowly and sent too much out of the country. The question of whether or not triumphal arches should be constructed was a hard-fought one. Money was collected from all classes of people to build about twenty-one arches, each costing not less than 800 tomans. Sanction was given to buy £1,000 worth of red, white and green cloth from Basra. Both the Governor- General and the military pressed for the erection of the arches. Then orders were received from Tehran not to build arches and the Governor-General attempted to remove them. The military objected and the arches stood. Mean while, the military telegraphed to Tehran that the people wished to build arches, finally, orders were received to remove them. It is said that the people of Sultanabad and Malayer complained to the Shah against being put to the expense of building arches and he agreed with their point of view. It is not known how the balance of the money collected will be distributed. ^ ^i 6 - ^ oca ^ . au fhorities tried to stop petitions being sent to the Shah some days before his arrival, but realised it was impossible.

A. J. GARDENER.Enclosure 2. Consul Watkinson to Mr. Seymour. (No. 13.) Sir, Shiraz, March 31, 1937. I HAVE the honour to report that the long-expected visit of His Majesty the Shah has at last taken place, after rumours had been current that all the preparations as described in my diary for February were in vain, as he would not leave the capital. From the western democratic standpoint, much appears to have been done in advance to render the visit unpalatable, and little during its progress to make it agreeable to the inhabitants of Shiraz. 2. The amount said to have been spent by the Governor-General and the municipal authorities on successive schemes of decoration has already been reported. A sum equal to five times that amount is generally believed to have been collected from the people and has not been accounted for, in addition to which many notables and merchants were forced to buy photographs of the Imperial Family at an excessive price, and tales are told of those who demurred being beaten. Every mason and carpenter in the town who did not hide was ordered to give his services free. Finally, only four of the original twenty-seven arches were left, erected nominally by the municipality, the ladies of Shiraz, the Sherket-i-Panbeh and the Sherket-i-Sedarat. • The remainder were demolished on instructions from Tehran that Muharrem could not be observed with flags and rejoicing. The two cotton mills, which had spent very considerable sums on erecting arches by order of the Governor-General, were instructed to remove them. 3. Two days before the arrival of His Majesty the road to Bushire was closed to all traffic. The mail also ceased to arrive from the north. At the same time the town was occupied by an armed police force from Tehran, and trafnc was for the most part diverted from the main roads through the town over which the Imperial procession was to pass. Donkeys and their drivers in particulai seemed to be unpopular. In addition to armed patrols, plain-clothes policemen mingled with the crowds of curious onlookers at the final preparations, and they must have heard much murmuring. Two members of the Church Missionary Society from Isfahan, who had obtained permission from the Rais-i-Ammeh to go to Bushire on the 24th March, were stopped on the road between Borazjan and Bushire and told that they must wait for three days at Ahmedi, a small and unpleasant village, till the Shah had passed. On payment of some inducement they were permitted to continue their journey. This savours o re y rahdan. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ tQ that the R als „i-Amnieh was himself held up on the following day by an over-zealous policeman and was foiced to return for a few words with the chief of police. i • f pw 5 All strav dogs were shot without warning by the police during tiie tew weeks' preceding^ Hi!

Fm ies Zand at6 intervals with flowers purloined from half the gardens of Shiraz. His Majesty passed down this road at 60 miles per hour. There was no time for cheering nor for casting of flowers, and no notice was taken of the people or the children. When the Shah had passed, they were marched away with their flowers. They had been there since 6-30 a.m. 9. A narrow street leads from the Khiaban-i-Zand to the house recently occupied by the Governorate-General, which had been prepared for the Shah. All the occupants of the houses in this street had been turned out by the police on the previous day. His Majesty slowed down at the corner, where there was feeble cheering, and drove slowly up to the'end of the street, where a delegation of women and boy scouts and the main body of school-children awaited him. He was greeted by rousing cheers here as he descended from his car. An address of welcome was read by the wife of the newly-appointed Governor of the Qashgai, after which His Majesty spoke a few words to the women and inspected the children. He was very genial, and he specially praised the girls from Khanum Ella Gerrard’s School. There is no record of his having found very much else to his satisfaction in Shiraz. A second woman presented a petition on behalf of her son, a Qashgai cadet, who was sentenced to death for striking his superior officer and had the sentence commuted to imprisonment. The mother has now joined her son. 10. During the afternoon of Saturday His Majesty remained in his house, though the Bagh-i-Takht barracks had been warned to expect him. On Sunday morning the Ears Manufacturing Company was instructed to await an inspection of their mill, the first to be erected in Iran and one which has hitherto been very successful. Towards the end of the morning a message was received that he might go later in the day. In the afternoon he reviewed the troops at the Bagh-i-Takht and again failed to visit the spinning mill. On Monday morning His Majesty again stayed indoors, though he was expected at the Kalah-i-Fars Industrial Exhibition. Tie spent the afternoon visiting the cavalry and artillery bai i acks and stopped for half an hour at the exhibition on his way back. He is iepoi ted to kave complained of its smallness and inadequacy, and to have stated that bhuaz industrial activity leaves much to be desired. Early on the following morning His Majesty left Shiraz for Persepolis and Isfahan. So far as is known, the Valiahd paid no visits and was never seen without his father. Thus,during a stay of two and a half days in Shiraz, His Majesty did no ^ mg u visit the various military establishments and an industrial exhibition organise wo yeais ago by the Government. Neither of the two spinning mills “ lted ’ 110r f'u th i e S T h ? h show interest in the schools nor in the museum Tomh nf 0 R?fi niSed i by ! 16 f; duca ^ 10n Department, nor in the restorations at the no demitatinr. 2 ^ D 16 ^asHd-i-Vekil.

The whole circumstances of this visit can have done nothing to increase the popularity of the Shah and of the present regime. No opportunity was taken of showing the Valiahd to the people or of letting him see anything of value to himself. It is most unfortunate that he was kept on leading-strings and had no chance for the display of initiative or geniality. I have, &amp;c. A. E. WATKINSON.

Sir, ’ WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 345 of the 10 th July, 1936, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorassan, enclosing an appreciation of the situation in East Iran. t t • 2. It may be of interest to compare this report with that enclosed m Mr. Butler’s despatch under reference, particularly as it is the first political report submitted by Mr. Squire, coming fresh to a district in which his predecessor had served for many years. It will be seen that Mr. Squire s report substantially bears out that received from Colonel Daly. The situation in East Iran is, in fact, unchanged. It is the same story of steadily growing control from the centre and the suppression of local initiative, combined with widespread bribery among officials and the same suspicion of British consular ofhceis. A further point of interest in Mr. Squire’s report is the fact that he agrees with the view always held by His Majesty’s Legation that, though the tiade restnctions and exchange control have had serious effects on trade by the overland route through India to Zahidan, there is no special desire to discriminate against Indian trade and traders. t t- • a ^ ^ 3 .

For the private individual and especially for consular officers and foreign merchants, who have constant dealings with the local authorities such as the customs and police, life k as a result made very much more difficult. Petty concessions m the matter of customs formalities which were formerly permitted are now being everywhere withdrawn, while the police often carry out what they imagine to be their instructions in the most ignorant and high-handed manner, with results that, where they do not involve actual hardship, are often ludicrous. For instance, the Indian attache in this consulate-general recently applied for a dm mg licence in Meshed and produced the usual three photographs of himself (hatless) for the purpose. He was told that, whereas the photographs for fire-arms licences must be without hats, those for drivers’ licences should be in peaked chauffeur’s caps. After some argument a compromise was effected and he was photographed again in a trilby hat. The same police office did, however, admit after some demur that a similar demand from the new consul-general, who had also submitted hatless photographs, was hardly suitable and need not be pressed. 2. With the people the popularity of the Government naturally depends on how they are affected as individuals, and this varies greatly. The old-fashioned still resent the introduction of western reforms as typified by the compulsory discarding of the veil and Persian “ kulla.” The younger generation welcome the liberty, which they are apt to interpret as licence, afforded by a more western outlook. The school-children, both boys and girls, from the ages of 6 to 18, in their grey uniforms, cannot fail to benefit from the fresh air and physical exercises which are carried out in public places under proper supervision. With the trading community, except for a few who have been able to make money as agents of, or shareholders in, the new monopoly companies, the new restrictions on trade are intensely unpopular, but these very restrictions bring their own compensations, and quite a number of traders, especially near the Indian border, are reported to be making a very good thing out of smuggling. Among the peasants, there are many who benefit by the manual employment on roads and other improvements, but a greater number feel the pinch of higher prices and are in actual want. This is especially the case in Sistan, where it is only the whole sale Government import of wheat from other provinces which saves the population from actual starvation. 3. The chief discontent seems to lie with the tribesmen on the Baluchistan borders. Many of the more peaceable Baluchis who do not like the present dress reforms have migrated permanently to Afghanistan and India, and others are definitely hostile to the Government. The shortage of food-stuffs, due in part to the failure of the crops in Sistan and in part to the deliberate action of the authorities m Mekran in withholding grain from the tribesmen, is another gnevance, but one which is effective apparently in preventing any organised opposition on a large scale. J n 5 n °h a hways easy to generalise in Iran, as conditions varv considerably fp • °, ias ^! 1 ? n ^ n ^ e vran - , fh e former the local administration is tolerably wields consi derable authority, at least in and to the militnn- * S&lt; i-, ' ,^ n -dohran, however, the civil power yields pride of place than in the nm’tlT 0 jr e accordingly more in evidence, anil less under control the Officials Of nJwW G o vernor - G cneral appears to have little influence over mtle to loose hbwek^f T 1118 - In the matter of h o“ est y there is probably Jong 4 ° it i s safe and the 6 W ° P' 0 ™- Brib «-y .is, of course, universal as Telrran the greater the r,,, i? rea tei the number of regulations promulgated m and lorries feavino- the ttwn h' f n r ac&lt; l uirin g wealth.

The mere threat of legal action against an official and the publicity that it will inevitably entail is sufficient to put a stop to any illeo-al or repressive measures that are being undertaken. Legal action therefore may in the near future become an increasingly powerful weapon in the hands of oieigneis, especially Indians with a litigious bent, to protect their own interests 6 . The boycott of all consular officers continues and their social ostracism is complete The one exception to this rule is Sartip Taj Bakhsh, the Governor- General of Mekran. ^ He apparently finds it unnecessary to conceal his desire to be friendly, and, in fact, has on more than one occasion gone out of his wav to be helpful. Only a few days ago, when visiting Zabul from Zahidan, he brought along with him my gun, which had just been released from the customs and which he knew I wanted for a Christmas shoot. Immediately on his arrival in Zabul he sent it round to the consulate, together with a very friendly note and a present of oranges. But all other officials are strictly forbidden to have any social inter course with consular officers. My first impressions have been that at Meshed this attitude is in accordance with the inclinations of the officials themselves (perhaps this is only the attitude of the Governor-General), but that in the south they would like to be much more friendly if only they dared. Certainly the few officials I have so far met in Mekran have been as polite and as helpful as could possibly be desired, and the Governor of Zabul, at our recent exchange of official visits, wistfully recalled the pleasant tennis parties which, in happier days, he used to attend at this consulate. A recent incident in Zabul will illustrate the severity of the boycott. An old Iranian, Mirza Abbas Ali Shirazi, who had at one time been munshi to Lord Minto and subsequently employed in this consulate, died last month in the consulate area, where he had been living for the last few years. His son, who is serving as a conscript in the infantry regiment stationed just outside our gates, did not dare to visit his old father even on his death-bed. 7. The isolation of consular officials makes it impossible to obtain any reliable information on military affairs, as army officers in particular are forbidden to have any dealings with ns. In the Mekran Province (which includes Sistan) the army appears to be increasing in efficiency as well as in numbers. Fresh equipment is constantly arriving and the standard of the new barracks which are springing up all over the province is certainly ambitious. They are said to be modelled entirely on Turkish plans. Whether any serious military action against the Balueh tribes is contemplated or not, it is difficult to say, but it seems improbable that the tribes can offer any real opposition, though this does not mean that they are ready to submit to Government authority. 8 . There has been no marked change in Soviet influence and activity. Soviet commercial interests still appear to flourish in Khorasan and the new consul- general, M. Polak, is reported to be on friendly terms with the Governor-General. Their activities do not, however, appear to have penetrated to Mekran. 9. Little has also been heard in East Iran of anti-Jewish propaganda, though Major Campbell, our vice-consul in Zahidan, reports that instructions have apparently been received to teach the public that Jews are not real Iranians and that they are responsible for having exported much of the wealth of the country. In conversation with an Iranian inspector of schools, Major Campbell suggested that the industrious M. Haim (a Jewish lexicographer) had produced some works of great value to the Iranian language. The inspector replied that the works were probably not original, and that in any case nothing good ever came from the Jews in Iran. 10. Trade conditions grow increasingly difficult. The barter agreement with Germany is diverting the bulk of the import and export trade to the Persian Gulf/ Monopoly companies are eliminating individual traders; and the foreign exchange regulations make what trade is left a matter of extreme difficulty. Indian traders have been very hard hit, but cannot leave the country, as they cannot get the foreign exchange to export their capital. A few of them have already left, while many of the petty shopkeepers are in very straitened circumstances. A few of the bigger men, however, though loud in theii complaints, seem to be less badly hit than they try to make out. They are still doino- well over the import of tea, and I have a shrewd suspicion that they are finding the smuggling into India of monopolised articles such as dixed fmits extremely and increasingly lucrative. It, at any i ate, fui nishes them with a means of exporting their capital, and though they apply with the others for4 , t t u„ v qhow no signs of attempting to wind up their as another has recently secured a la S bted that the trade regulations formed in i barracks m Mekran.

S. Mr. Allawy reported having heard a rumour to the effect that between five and seven thousand Kurds, counting women and children, have left Iran with their movable property, crossing into Iraq at an unguarded point between rerdeeht and Sulimanieh. He tninks it is not a temporary or seasonal transfer, but a final removal. The impetus, he suggests, may have come from recent fresh grievances such as the grain control. The Kurds are believed to resent it strongly, and indeed it ie not difficult to imagine circumstances in which it might be used by the government as a weapon against the tribes. 3. Mr. Allawy does not suggest that this rumour should be accepted as true without some confirmation* Be nimself is now almost without channels of information from Kurdistan. I have mentioned, in my diaries that the police in lehabad ordered Iraqi residents in June last to leave. The order was subsequently cancelled, but Mr. Allawy states that the Iraqis preferred to move from a district where business was being made difficult for them. Five went back to Iraq, and the remainder to abria or Hezaieh. Two Iraqis who used to come to Kh&amp;nen on the frontier for the s simmer/ Minister, tieh Legation, TEHRAN.sommar traffic tiave decided to leave for good because there is now virtually no commercial movement over the frontier. t the moment there are only two Iraqis between '’nbriz and the frontier In Mr. Allevy’s district, and they are in yiandaab. It is difficult therefore to discover what value to place on this rumour 4. Mr. All&amp;wy went on to tell me that certain mo11ahe in Tabriz had enquired of him confidentially whether there existed any means whereby some fifty upper-class families who are discontented with conditions here might acquire Iraqi nationality and remove to Iraq. ie has had such enquiries before, but only from individuals, and he interprets this group enquiry as a sign of increasing discontent. 5. It is, of course, inevitable that Mr. Allawy’s views should be prejudiced in favour of his own country. It is also inevitable taat tnere should occur the individual who praises 'All centuries but this, and. every country but his own .* Nevertheless I think that Mr. Allawy may not be far wrong in thinking that many individuals throughout this province, and considerable group© of Kurds in particular in the Kurdish territories, are deterred only by the dangers and difficulties of removing their property, of finding fresh grazing grounds or employment as the case may be, from trying their fortunes in Iraq. Whether they would be napoier there than here, is, of course, a matter of opinion. The attraction for many is the greater religious freedom for Moslems in Iraq. In addition to considerations of neligi&gt;n, the Kurds believe that conditions here may soon be as bad for them as they are in Turkey, and that Iraq, still allows them a certain measure of their traditional freedom. 6 ./6# It is clear that this ffi'ive&amp;ent across the frontier if it has actually t&amp;Ken plece^ must have been planned some time ago and was probably not in any way affected by the Shah’s recent visit to Kurdistan. It is interesting, nevertheless, to consider what may iiave been the impression created among people already discontented. I think that the Shah’s complete inaccessibility probably aggravated discontent. The ordinary citizen, observing the Shah’s solidarity with the official and military classes, must have abandoned any hope that there could ever be a successful appeal to the supreme authority for a lightening of existing burdens. As for the Kurds, their leaders are reported to have assembled, by order, at prescribed points, to greet the Shah. J is remarks to them were in familiar vein; he enjoined tne® to devote themselves to agriculture and to peaceful pursuits, not meddling in matters of government. This from an old warrior, still lusty and stalwart, with a promising young s &gt;n by his side, may well have confirmed discontented Kurds in the belief that, barring unexpected upheavals, the future watch Iran offers to e race of free end proud mountaineers is unbearably humdrum.

Some effort seems to be put forth by the authorities to encoura G Julfa Armenians to participate in the industrial boom and form a company their own. But they say that they are still the object of discrimination practice, and that the Government is doing its best to limit the teaching o Armenian language in their own schools. ,1 9. The wave of anti-Semitism which swept over many parts of Iran r ? cen ^ seems to have passed completely, if it did not entirely miss, Isfahan, ioi Jewish community here, which consists almost wholly of Iranian Jews and, wi one or two notable exceptions, is poor rather than rich, does not appear to su under any special disabilities at the moment. t 10. Foreigners in general are treated with much less suspicion and distius than in some other parts of Iran, and it is possible for a private individual to mi in local society. The Soviet consul-general, M. Atabekoff, is a member botn ^ the Iranian club in Isfahan and of the Armenian club in Julfa, having b ee invited to join the Iranian club by the Governor of Isfahan. He can i ^ 1 ^ Iranians to his house, provided that the Governor be of the party, and receive as many as fifty or sixty on the occasion of his national day. Both the Impel ' 1 Bank and the Church Missionary Society are regarded with respect an friendliness, and in the case of the mission a good deal of help, both official an unofficial, is given to its activities. On the whole, the British community enjoys a better position than in towns such as Kermanshah and Hamadan. , German community, too, though divided against itself by personal likes andenials ^ Thedislikes, also seems to enjoy Iranian favour. It is probable that this greater men, al| degree of favour displayed towards foreigners in general is due, in part, at any rate, to the enlightenment of the Governor, who has realised that Iran can, and ilthouglj: does, benefit from their activities. The position which certain individuals have into Ini® won f° r themselves in the eyes of Iranians here has also helped to cause a idsideor[r ^favourable y i ew to be taken of their compatriots. I rail 11 . Isfahan is not a town which enjoys any special favour in the eyes of [ egs j’ the Shah—the only time he came here, some years ago now, he spent the night outside the town—and the feeling is reciprocated by the Isfahanis. Nevertheless, , an jj the activities of the Zill-es-Sultan and his large family and of the many ; Bakhtiari khans are not for that reason remembered with any pleasure. The t j ? Isfahan! would probably like nothing better than to be left alone to work, but n government in Iran, as it grows more experienced and elaborate, enters more ■|7 °| etl: and more deeply into the everyday life of the people and, from the point of view tiierekf: ^ tlie avera g e maIlj its nuisance value tends to outgrow any other value it may have had in protecting him from the attentions of his local princeling or tribal aerlydepil } eac [ er The Shah is probably held responsible in the main for this state of ™s: Hi affairs and so has become looked upon simply with fear, since no one knows what petition dt new f orm 0 f regimentation is going to be thrust on them, and has lost any respect businesst«: he may once have enjoyed as a man of action anxious to help his country. Apart from this, it is unlikely that the average Isfahani thinks very much about His old leakg: Imperial Majesty unless the cost of living appears to be getting too high. dully in i CHARLES A. GAULT.

A Memorandum on Political Affaiis in Azeibaijan. (A)— External. (a) The !/.£.£.# .—The Russians were steadily extending their influence southwards into this district before the war. Penetration became more rapid under the justification of military necessity, and the completion of the railway from Julfa to Tabriz and of the highway over a considerable part of the Julfa- Rezaieh route were overt expressions of an intention to annex the province at a suitable moment. The Russian revolution saved it for Persia. The Soviets disdained material conquest, but set about converting the people to communism. They failed. The Moslem population dislikes communistic principles, while the Tehran Government, growing strong under Reza Khan, stoutly resisted the Russian influences, deporting persons suspected of acting as agents for the Russian consulate-general, and hampering the propagandists in every possible way. Now the Bolsheviks appear to have lost their first missionary enthusiasm. Whereas my predecessor was, even as recently as three or four years ago, receiving reports of Bolshevik intrigue and propaganda (mainly from somewhat unreliable Armenian sources), I can find to-day no evidence of any such activity. So far as one can judge here, the Russians have for the time being adopted the policy of live and let live,” perhaps because they are fully occupied elsewhere. There is not at present any source of irritation along the frontier, although there appears to be a somewhat frigid correctness at points such as Julfa, where bathers on the Iranian side were recently warned to stay well within the mid-stream line, lest t re Russians should fire on them. Matters commercial appear to be moving smoothly enough under the existing trade agreements. One does hear of disputes trom time to time, as for example, a recent one about the quality of the cement being delivered for the new gram silo, but they are matters for discussion and florpnmifp a ^ s ? h ears °f good-neighbourly acts, such as the p ^ ao-nfn 1 ^ Russiaiis of damaged grain, which could no longer be stored hmm’esirt^T ' J ' the m ™eipality stood in need.

It will be well worth patching how far the Iranian Government will succeed in replacing the exS Russian culture and skills by the new Iranian culture, with its French veneer, and the technical instruction now being given in Government schools by German Less within the control of the Government is the dependence of Azerbaiian on Russia for commercial prosperity. The natural flow of trade is northwards. The south takes little from Azerbaijan and offers little. At present the foreign trade of Russia is a Government monopoly, and carried on by official departments. Iran has adopted a similar principle, and against the Russian trade agencies has set up large monopolistic concerns. Trade, instead of flowing freely, has been canalised and controlled as to volume. Hundreds of merchants, who formerly gained a livelihood from the trade with Russia, each tending his small individual streamlet, have been thrown out of business. Azerbaijan is poorer in consequence. The people in trade in Azerbaijan deeply regret the elimination of the capitalists in Russia. They bitterly resent the measures which the Iranian Government has in its turn considered necessary in the interests of this country’s foreign Hade. Azerbaijan finds itself in the unhappy position of being crushed between the upper and the nether mill-stones. It is generally believed that bad times will persist until trade again becomes free with Russia. Apart from her own trade, Russia offers a route for trade between Iran and Western Europe. In his annual report on the trade of Resht in 1878, Mr. Consul Churchill, writing after Batoum had become Russian and speculating on the effects of a railway connecting the Black Sea with the Caspian, expressed the belief that trade xvith Europe would become much easier for Persia if only the Russians would not place impediments in the way. “ As it is,” he went on, “the difficulties thrown in the way of the transit of merchandise through the Caucasus by the Russian customs authorities 'are so great that merchants in general trading with this country prefer sending their goods through Bagdad and Bushire.” If the recent conference about the Dardanelles showed that the Bolsheviks have inherited at least certain principles of Tsarist policy, the Batoum customs authorities have given proof that they too have inherited the attitude of their predecessors towards the transit trade. If the ancient route through Trebizond is modernised it will largely be because Iran feels the need of an alternative route to the sea. The Julfa-Batoum railway is cheapest, and ought to be the quickest, but Russia appears far from willing to facilitate a transit trade in competition with her own. The question arose in a discussion which I had with the manager of the National Bank about merchandise from England lying at Trebizond. He was quite frank as to his preference for the Trebizond route, despite its natural difficulties. He said that one could never trust the Russians, that they were capable of raising obstacles to the passage of goods without warning and without sufficient cause. I have already reported a plan for improving railway services between the U.S.S.R. and this country whereby loaded trucks will be allowed to cross the frontier. This arrangement, it is thought, will soon come into force, but it will not benefit the transit trade if goods are still to be liable, as at present, to delay in the Batonm customs. The Russian consular and trade officials form a large, but not a very impressive, group. Some of them speak the local language, but hardly any have even the slightest knowledge of European languages, so that they necessarily remain aloof from other foreign consuls. They are hardly less completely segregated from the Iranians, private as well as official. It is notorious that the owner of a small shop at the entrance to the consulate-general is a police s Py&gt; and that all visits are reported. Visitors of Iranian nationality are geneially asked later to explain their business to the police. . (b) Turkey.—The people of Azerbaijan do not like the lurks. It is said that although they have been glad on occasion to have Russian troops come m, and might even welcome them again, they would be unitedun resisting the Lurks. [865 b—5] B 2The reason is that whereas the Russian invaders brought money with them and generally created something, the Turks simply pillaged and destroyed. * There is of course, a new Turkey just as there is a new Russia, but the change has not been for the better. Whereas Russia produced communism, Turk eT also has sponsored startling and obnoxious doctrines; more than that, Ataturk has clasped the hand of the Shah, and, according to local belief, poisoned his mind with ideas subversive of the established social order and obnoxious to goofl Moslems Ataturk is considered to be the fons et oricjo of all such conceptions as the hatting of men, the unveiling of women, the discomfiture of the mullahs, with more threatening, such as the adoption of the Latin script and the Sunday as the weekly day of rest. Turcophiles are accordingly few, and limited to those who know Stambul or have agents there. It is, nevertheless, recognised locally that the official attitude to Turkey is one of closest friendship. If Ataturk’s failure to find time to repay the Shah’s visit has had a chilling effect, the officials do not show it here. The Turkish consulate has been favoured above the others, by the military, for example, who attend Turkish receptions when they would excuse themselves from the receptions of other consuls. As regards trade, the economy of Turkey is too similar to that of Iran for any great flow of trade between the two countries. Turkey’s importance consists in the route she offers through Trebizond. It is long and difficult, but already it is attracting some classes of goods solely because the authorities at Trebizond are more accommodating than those of ' Batoum, and more reliable, possibly because Turkey has everything to gain and nothing to lose by making the transit trade easy. If a railway is constructed eventually, the route will become easier, cheaper and less liable to stoppage in winter. The Turks for their part are said to be building a line in the direction of Van, whence it will be continued to Bash Kaleh on the frontier, but this information requires confirmation. Local opinion is quite unsympathetic towards the proposal to build a corresponding railway on the Iranian side of the frontier, for reasons which will be discussed m the section dealing with internal affairs. (c) Imq is the least important, so far as Azerbaijan is concerned, of Iran’s neig oms. the frontier is virtually closed, while Western Azerbaijan is treated vs a mi l aiy zone in which the presence, even as passing visitors, of foreigners is hannAnimf 16 ! 18 t ^ er ^ ore difficult to obtain information as to what is no^imnnrfmu 011 ^ ^ frontier.

(d) Foreigners.—Reacting violently from the weakness in face of foreign diplomacy shown by the last regime, the Shah, is obviously resolved to repulse any attempt at foreign penetration, commercial or political. His attitude is, of course, reflected in the bearing of provincial officials. There appears, indeed, to be some system whereby provincial officials are, when in Tehran, keyed up to a suitable pitch of hauteur MVa-ws foreigners. It has been noted that newly- appointed officials, or officials who have just paid a visit to the capital (the chief of police, for example, who returned recently from such a visit) bring back a somewhat aggressive sense of dignity, and tend at first to use the 'certainly not! tone of voice; but that after a space they begin to relapse into their natural, easy-going courtesy, and to find difficult again to say 'No.” The official attitude towards foreigners is indeed not quite healthy or natural in Iranians. With the effort to wear a distant and superior manner goes an inner conviction of inferiority, and something approaching certainty that foreigners are secretly amused. This explains the sensitiveness to foreign press opinions, the lust to acquire all the toys of civilisation, trains, cars, aeroplanes, hospitals and so forth, the childish anxiety to play at being Europeans, to wear hats and doff them to ladies unveiled and all decked out in feminine finery. The average Iranian probably sees Europeans as persons on a stage, acting according to a set of con ventions, moving in bright lights and clad in pretty-pretty clothes. They are not yet in touch with European reality, and their imitation of us is accordingly artificial and romantic. Time is the only cure, and the only way to meet these people is with under standing and a sense of humour, a readiness to meet them half-way but not a step further. The worst possible, probably, is to show obsequiousness or undue deference, as, to their great discomfiture, the French and Italians did to the incoming Kemalists at Smyrna in 1922. Foreigners who bear these principles in mind appear to escape unduly severe vexations, but the obstacles to trade and the general suspiciousness effectively prevent, for the present, any individual foreigner whatever his nationality from acquiring any great influence either with the merchants or the officials. If he threatened to do so he would quickly, like any Kurkish chieftain, have his wings clipped. Nevertheless, the State is prepared to use the services of foreigners, but only as salaried employees, liable to dismissal. The Iran of to-day is not a comfortable country for any but men of small calibre and obedient dispositions, whether they be foreign or native. (B)— Internal. (1) Minorities. (a) A ssyrians .—There are comparatively few Assyrians in Tabi iz and Eastern Azerbaijan, the main body being concentrated in Western Azerbaijan, and especially around Rezaieh. It is said that possibly 50,000 fled when the Turks invaded that territory during the war and that perhaps 30,00 re u rne Such as brought arms back with them have been disarmed. On the whole, these people are, by local standards, prosperous. Many of them possess houses or vine yards or some such stake in the country. They enjoy their possessions undisturbed ^ 'TshlSdiThriln ^riSrians are not united. Many are Catholics, many Protestant and some Orthodox. As for politics, they do not appear to be politically-minded as compared, for example with the f 1929 Thev have many relatives in the United States and until the slump ot lyy they Aectived important remittances. This proof of £ countries, confirmed by the earnings of the menfolk m Jevies by the lav sh distribution of relief at the end of the war and, more recently the concern shown for Assyrians at Geneva have unsettled this = Ry and with its prospects m Iran. Ibis pnase, piesui H F better land, equality with their Moslem neighbours.(b) Armenians.—The territory south-east of Mount Ararat was formerly thickly populated with Armenians, but there are few of them now in the extreme north-west of Azerbaijan and along the Aras. 1 hey are dispersed through the two provinces, and Tabriz contains a strong colony, headed by the archbishop They are found also in strength in Maragha, Mianduab and Rezaieh, while many of the Karadagh villages are Armenian. Apart from a few rich families, the majority are of the peasant or artisan classes. They live peacefully and are not molested by the Moslems. They are eligible for service in Government depart ments. The archbishop, supreme in his flock, is treated with respect by the authorities and appears to have successfully gained their confidence. His declarations, it is said, are accepted at their face value; he is an honoured guest at official receptions. The Armenians have an aptitude for political intrigue. Here they are divided into two parties, Dashnag and Hinchag. The first is conservative and at present tends to concern itself with the culture of the race, its language and its schools. The archbishop is of this party. The second is more revolutionary. Some years ago it published a newspaper which favoured bolshevism, but that has been suppressed, the leaders have gone to Russia and the party is quiescent. (c) White Russians. —Of these there have been considerable numbers in Azer baijan, but the Iranian authorities have consistently moved all but the long- established Russians to the south. These refugees appear to be assured oA ready market for their skill and knowledge, provided they are willing to keep away from the border region and to become Iranian subjects. (W, Jews are few in Tabriz, no more than four or'five families. Even these came originally from Rezaieh, where, until the establishment of the national home tor ttie Jews m Palestine, there lived some 200 families. That number has been reduced by migration to Palestine, how far is not known. The Jews do not a rac undue attention. So far as is known the authorities are not in any way disposed to molest them. None of them is outstanding with wealth or influence. re n° S ^ merc ^ an ^ s d ea l m g hi textiles in a smallish way, or silversmiths. y o / en * me 1 nt s P°] lc y towards these minorities is Well-defined, and minority ILfl‘v, t0 b ?t Ca ed Wls y 0bvlousl y&gt; its first principle must be that no its second ^ meails ,? f embarrassing the Government politically, and races within the State Lmilated^ 10 ^ “ ^ the pe ° ple of ^ disarmed and nowenip.l ’f* S been enforced.

(a) Kurds .—These comprise a number of tribes inhabiting the mountainous aiea along the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers. Until after the war they were largely independent, armed, and capaole of causing a good deal of trouble. They have raided labriz m times of weakness in Tehran. Encouraged by the Turks Sunnis like themselves, they became formidable under the famous Ismail Anha (Simkol during the war, occupying the towns west and south of Lake Urumia and usurping m that district the functions of Government. It is one of the present Shah’s most notable achievements that whereas none ot his predecessors succeeded in taming the unruly Kurds, one soldier can now as people say, go out and bring in a hundred of them. His greatest success has been along the Turkish frontier, where, in consequence of the concerted policy of the two Governments, the Kurds have been unable to play the one off against the other, or to dodge back and forth across the frontier at will. In this area the tribes have been disarmed and they are resigned to inactivity for the time beino-. Along the Iraqi frontier the situation is different. The Iraqi Kurds have not been disarmed and those on this side have pleaded the necessity of having weapons for that reason. Nevertheless, the first principle of policy, which is the same as with the minorities, has been applied to a considerable extent. Despite their arms, the Kurds of South Azerbaijan, Ardalan and Kurdistan have been weakened by the removal of leaders. Those, like Omar Khan for example, who are unwilling to submit completely, are either killed or, as in the case of the man just mentioned, imprisoned. Those who remain free have to wear the cloak of humility, as for example the leaders who, as reported in my diaries, waited on the pleasure of the general from Rezaieh when he inspected the frontier last April. Even they are now being moved out of their own districts and quartered in towns under the eye of a garrison commander. The registration of names and property, the maintenance of strong local garrisons, the imposition of military service wherever possible, all tend towards the application of this first principle that there shall be no political or military organisations within the State except those of the Government. Fi'esh measures are still being devised. The Lutheran mission to the Kurds has been forced out of Mehabad. Recently the police warned the Iraqis west of Mehabad to quit, and although their consul was able to have the order withdrawn, he has now received a reply from the Governor-General of Western Azerbaijan which indicates that the incident is not closed. The Governor-General justifies the police order by section 13 of the law governing the entry and residence of foreigners, and implies that it will be enforced. The Turkish consul fears that the 250 Turkish citizens who reside in the district between Ushnu and Senna will be required to move eventually, as well as.the Iraqis. The consistency with which foreigners are being discouraged from residing in Kurdish territory is surely rather extreme if it is based merely on the fear that the thin scattering of uninfluential foreigners in Kurdish territories at present might stir the tribes to rebellion. One wonders whether perhaps some further move in the direction of weakening the tribal organisations is not being prepared, some measure which the Government might not wish foreignei s to observe. „ 1 1 , , , . So much for the systematic destruction of the old order; there is now a little to say about reconstruction on a new foundation. According to icpoit a ceitain Manassarian, a Russian Armenian, acquired under Russian protection considerable estates in the Turkish frontier zone. When the Tehran Government rnis.arnmm u iri thpqp regions, it ousted Manassarian, despite became strong enough , foi-ei°'ner had no right to hold such property Soviet ^ ^ 1S ^ S ° W ,« rara^to w 3^ that tWs problem of the Shahsevans is simpler than that of the(| ( ) . , i foreign Power which might take then part is Russia, ^dEussmused them so rou^ly in 1912 tta^they have little reason to tumto her - This tri'‘b^n'dl-nC 6 on occasion as the most powerful m Persia. Properly speaking, of course, it is a loose federation of many small tribes, w o hate frequently found themselves united into a strong force by common enmity towards the Central Government. Highway robbery and holding to ransom were everyday trades. That has been completely stopped, and while it is difficult to obtain information, the fact that security is perfect on the roads running through their territory and that no incidents are reported suggests that they have been completely subjugated by the Central Government As regards assimilation, this is being attempted as with the otheis. 1 hav|H recorded in my diaries the attempt, suspended for the moment, but by no means abandoned, to induce the nomad tribes to settle m houses instead of in movingB tents and to have themselves registered and their flocks numbered. It appears that a good deal of land is available for settlement, while the proposed irrigation of the Moghan steppe on the Iranian side of the border is intended to provide more. . Jg (c) Karadaghis .—The inhabitants of the Karadagh, capital Ahar, do not constitute a definite tribe. Intermixed with the Moslems are many Armenians. But the relative inaccessibility of the mountainous region they inhabit has given them a certain separate and common independence in the past and local leaders have on occasion raised forces which have played important parts in the politics of Persia. The last occasion was when the Central Government used them against the Kurd Ismail Khan, and in those operations the Karadaghi leader Amir Arshad was killed. He left behind him a brother, Sardar Ashair, but he is of poorish quality as a leader and has no power now. The Shah’s strong arm rules throughout the district and there is no talk now of Karadaghi horsemen; the mountaineers are now seen by Tabrizis as their oafish country cousins, who walk their mounts into town with loads of charcoal. (3) Moslems. There remains the Aloslem core of the population. It is considered to be somewhat more fanatical, more resolute in its hold on tradition than the people or the 8011 th. Indeed the Azerbaijani believes, with some justification, that in personal physique, in business and in warfare, he is a sounder, sharper and braver man than the Persian of the south.

Well ‘ known and general through the country Briefly, they are based on the acceptance of Western superioritv and for the first time a Moslem ruling class is humbling itself in presence of its Chi istian minorities by adopting their social manners. The men now wear European dress; the women are not effectively unveiled, but the first and greatest step has been taken m the discarding of the chaddar.

Se f there 18 no 81 g n of that sort of thing becoming geneial yet awhile; but the younger people of both sexes are prepared to mingle m European fashion, and again the first step towards a new social order has been taken.

They are being prepared for a break with the traditions of their fathers and there is no reason to suppose that they wi retuse the invitation to move forwards with the promise of new and better mgs. JNew and in some cases fine school buildings are being erected at various points throughout the northern provinces. The French curriculum has been adopted, technical instruction is being given and all pupils are made to play games, to march and drill and generally to take themselves seriously as future citizens. All are being taught Persian, and there are to be schools in which tu? 11 adults ma y I earn Persian. Matters of health are not being neglected, the Government is establishing new hospitals, while the local Red Lion committees have provided hospitals and clinics in many towns. X-ray and other modern equipment has been purchased from Germany at the cost of thousands of pounds. In theory, preparations are being made to treat all sorts of diseases m all classes of the population. A proper leper village has just been completed and promises the end of a long-standing scandal. As regards the economic sphere, the range of official control and guidance is very wide. The main divisions are agriculture, local industry and foreign trade. The task of land registration has been begun, and the Doomsday Book is being written. There are difficulties necessarily in a country where few records have been kept, but the work will doubtless go on and provide a new basis of land ownership. It may be mentioned that in general the Government appears to favour the claim of the small-holder as against the big landowner in such disputes as arise over title. Taxation methods have been changed and for the old payment of a part of the produce through the landlord has been substituted a uniform tax of 3 per cent, of the value of agricultural produce sold. The under lying principle is the same as may be traced through all the Shah's activities, [865 b—5] c10 the elimination of all who enjoy even the suggestion of personal power vis-i-m the mass of the people whether they be Kurdish chiefs or merely landlords, and to substitute the direct sovereignty of the Government that is, the Shah. Efforts have been made to increase and vary the agricultural yield, as for example, the new su°'ar beet crop in the Maliabad—Mianduab region to feed the new sugar refinery 5 there and the extended area under cotton in the Maku district. Branches of the Agricultural Bank have been established m various towns, and considerable suins advanced to the farming classes. So far there do not appear to have been any importation of new stock for breeding purposes into Azerbaijan, but numbers of horses have passed through from Europe, indicating that the need for purchase of animals abroad has been recognised. Now there is talk of a commission, or commissions, to be formed from the landowning class who are to look into the possibilities of improving methods of agriculture, of bettering the breeds of domestic animals, and of conserving water for irrigation purposes. Most important, reforestation is to be attempted. Large companies have already been formed to ensure the proper preparation of agricultural produce for sale, and to market it, notably in the case of dried fruits, abroad. Grain silos are being built to provide proper storage for a sufficient reserve of grain to tide the country over bad harvests. As regards local industry, the Government appears to favour the transition from handcrafts to machinery. The ancient carpet industry is already showing the effects of the new pressure to produce at a higher rate. Makers are tending to concentrate on a quick overturn of capital by the production of more, but inferior, rugs at a higher rate. Weavers are leaving the poorly paid carpet industry to take employment in the new textile and leather tanning factories. Men with capital, even when they have reduced opportunities to employ it as in those branches of trade which have been taken over by monopolistic companies, are mistrustful of the new industrial expansion and inclined at present to leave their money idle until it is seen what profits are being earned by existing concerns, I he most important so far are certain textile factories and' leather tanneries, they appear to be working profitably.

The questions which must be answered, so far as possible, are: Whence does this urge for progress arise? How far is it genuine to date, how far spunous . How far is it likely to carry the country ? 1 aking the political sphere first, one has to admit a very great achievement m tj 16 com P^ ete pacification of Azerbaijan. The strength of the Shah, ruthlessly used, has removed all possible enemies, but it has not degenerated into merely vengeful persecution of minorities or tribes as such. On the contrary, as its means permit, the Government appears anxious to give non-national and nomad elements the means of becoming useful citizens, and that so far as possible within the natural and cultural setting which they have inherited. It is perfectly true that, if the Shah were to die, the minorities might again intrigue, the tribesmen reassemble; but every passing year renders the task of control by future Shahs more easy. It is true that some of the discontented say they prefer the old conditions because, if they did have to pay something to the Shahsevans to avoid molestation on the highway, they were at least making profits which covered such an outlay many times over; but they do not mean this really. No one can deny that the security now prevailing throughout Azerbaijan is a condition of the greatest value for the life of the population as a whole. While discipline has been thus successfully imposed from above, there has been no attempt so far to develop self-discipline or co-operation among the people as a whole. In so far as civics are “ The science .... of the development in the public mind of the will for constructive, intelligent and healthful participation in the work which Governments, local and national, are empowered by the people to perform they are an entirely neglected science in this part of the country. Nobody here takes seriously the representative capacity of the Majlis; the members are the creatures of the Shah, it is believed. Local government amounts to very little; the municipal council is locally elected, as is the chamber of commerce, but neither has the power to deal with any by the matters of simple routine; the Governors-General, and the chiefs of police, are nominated by Tehran, and through them every matter of the slightest importance is referred to the Ministries in the capital. The katkhudas in the villages are nominated by the sub-Governors. Everything depends directly on the Government, and the Government is nothing and nobody but the Shah in the minds of the people. He therefore bears all the odium for hard times and the discomforts caused by the transition to newer ways and methods. No scapegoat Minister will be allowed by opinion in Azerbaijan at all events to carry away the blame for mistakes or disaster, if the pessimists are justified.

The inadequaw P r7n de m^l iSes lv expldn the Shah has been much more successful m dealing with m illor ities and tribes than with Moslems, with matters political thanwith matters social and economic. It appears, moreover to be a fact that he standard of honesty among officials has become lower these two or three years. Many of them are said to be daring practices which they thought too dangerous in the Shah's first years in power. They have been encouraged by the Shahs own seizure of great wealth, and by the light punishments inflicted for corruption A critical examination of progress m the social sphere reveals that much of it is'the thinnest veneer. The unveiling of women must have some value as suggesting to them that they are capable of more useful lives, but no adequate attempt is being made to educate them for such lives, d he Fiench cmiiculmn is far ahead of what pupils here can tackle with success. Girls of tender years are struggling with the differential calculus when they ought to be learning the many things which their mothers cannot teach—simple hygiene, some rules of health which might save many of the children who die from ignorance or neglect, how to sew, and how to cook. The companies of boy scouts and girl guides formed some months ago have so far learned nothing but how to salute in uniform. In the same way it must be said that the details of new hospitals and of provision for the sick, which read well in the papers and doubtless flatter official self-complacency a great deal, represent a very superficial attempt to deal with the problem of public health. The country could afford to lose all those unfortunates whom the doctors and hospitals may save for a few years if a tenth of the children who are denied by neglect and ignorance the chance to live were saved for the country. It is all so superficial. The one comfort is that these showy attempts at progress do reveal a realisation of the need for improve ment, and one may hope that the next generation will improve on them by getting to the roots of the problem. As for economics, some attempt will be made to analyse the progress made in this sphere in a separate report. 'Nothing in the attitude of the people of Azerbaijan suggests approval of this reforming zeal. The measures are imposed from above, seldom, if ever, invited by the people. The question as to how far and how long this progress can continue depends in the first instance on how long the Shah lives. It is probably perfectly safe to state that, so long as he lives and retains the use of his faculties, there will be no challenge to his supremacy, nor any effective opposition to whatever reforms his Government may decree. The question of utmost interest is : What are the qualities of his son ? People here are not impressed by the new-found royalty of Peza Shah. His career in Azerbaijanis perfectly well known; and so there is no disposition to accept his son as enjoying any divine right of succession. The attempts to popularise the young man, the atcoun s o his skill at games, of his public duties and his pictures arouse no enthusiasm.

So much so that almost the only detailed propLcy 1 have been able to secure—from a landowner in Khorassan—as to the probable immediate consequences should the Shah unfortunately pass from the scene in the near future, is to the effect that it would not be a case of a local commander seeking separatist authority in his particular province, but rather of the local troops splitting up into squatting or marauding bands. 3 The reports in these series that have seemed of special interest are those trom the two turbulent provinces, Khorassan and Azerbaijan, and from the two which are virtually self-supporting, Azerbaijan again and Khuzistan. As regards these three provinces there seems general agreement on three principal points : First, and potentially the most dangerous, the extreme unpopularity of the present^regime, which is recognised to be the Shah and the Shah only; and this in spite of the security he has created, the strong and wise treatment of minorities to which Mr. Urquhart refers, and in spite of, or because of, the not unsuccessful introduction of many progressive measures, socially and in the economic field. Secondly, the Shah’s success in breaking completely and perhaps permanently the old local centres of authority and of resistance to the central power. Mechanical transport has been and must remain a big factor in favour of the Tehran Government in this connexion. And thirdly, the extreme paucity °f officials who under this regime are willing to undertake even minor responsi bility, or who possess even mediocre ability. This point wns discussed in the annual report for last year. I do not wish to question either the harm that this dearth is now doing, e.g., in the Khuzistan customs service, nor its possible effect on the permanence of the Shah’s work, but there is reason to think that it is much more marked in the provinces than in Tehran. In the course of not very long conversations, both Mr. Fraser, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, this spring, and Dr. Schofield, head of the Loughborough Technical College, who is mwv visiting Iran, volunteered to me that they had been pleasurably surprised by the quality of the officials at the head of the various public and semi-public institu tions in Tehran, compared with what they had found in the provinces. And— though this is a different point—when the Persian Government engage officials from abroad, they seem successful in getting good ones. [865 b—4]2 4. It may be observed that none of the reports stress the kindling of an Iranian national feeling often associated with the Sha There ^ no doubt that this feeling exists; it is probably stronger m Tehran than elsewhere but talk reported to this Legation of humble people at Meshed and of tribal leaders in the Kashgai country attests its existence outside the capital and other centres of development, and it must, I think, be reckoned an impondei able that favours on \ the whole the present dynasty. ■, 5 In the interesting general survey at the close or his memorandum, His^ Maiesty’s consul at Tabriz did not venture on a prophecy as to what would follow the Shah’s demise, beyond the opinion that each succeeding year of the Shah’s lifetime will render the maintenance of order easier for his successors. This is the general view, and time may also have an important modifying influence on the unpopularity of the regime. According to reports from several quarters, both conscription and the unveiling of women are not only now accepted but are even popular with part of the population affected. Further, though the standard of living among many sections of the population seems at present to be getting actually worse, the passage of a few years must enable many of the enterprises started by the Shah to improve some of the conditions they attack, if at first mainly through the giving of employment and good wages. And there is, of course, the bearing of time on the succession of the Valiahd. 6. As Mr. Urquhart writes : “ The question of utmost interest is, ‘ What are the qualities of the Yaliahd? ’ ” His Imperial Highness does not consort with the Diplomatic Corps and not much is yet known of him. But the newly- appointed Egyptian Minister, wdiose varied but not unbalanced career must have given him opportunities to judge men, had half an hour’s talk with him recently. Abdel Rahman Azzam told me that the young man’s ingenuousness on some points had tickled him, but he had formed a favourable impression and thought he discerned in him some of his father’s strength. It is a pity that, according to the head of the Protocol Department, the Shah feels that he cannot spare his son to visit England as his representative to the Coronation next May, and I hope the more that it may eventually prove possible to establish some contact between the Shah and His Majesty’s Legation. Father and son are at present visiting Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, and the newspapers do not fail to record jubilation and grateful enthusiasm. The Shah is next to display Khorassan and South Persia to the young man before he settles down to his studies at the military college controlled by a French colonel this autumn. Whatever may be the destiny of the two, I have found in conversations during the last few months with His Majesty s consular officers from many parts of Persia unanimity of view that His Majesty s Government must hope that the father’s strong rule will continue, and sufficiently long to permit of a peaceful succession by the Valiahd. The view is commonly expressed by my colleagues here that an object of the Shah's foreign policy is to secure satisfactory relations wdth his neighbour States so that the succession may be undisturbed from without. This may help to explain the very correct attitude that, since the fall of Mr. Kazemi, the Persian Government has adopted towards His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. There is a strong feeling, too, that the Shah desires to regularise his relations with Iraq as soon as possible. 7.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 588 of — ^ the 8th August, I have the honour to inform you that the trial of 23 persons, mostly former members of the staff of the Ministry of Communications, involved in the scandals connected with road and other contracts granted by the Ministry, opened on the 25th August and ended on the 8th September with the conviction of 18 of the accused who were sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from three years to two months. The remaining five accused were acquitted. 2. The majority of the charges arose out of bribes said to have been given to members of the Ministry of Roads and Communications by representatives of Skoda who are building many bridges in Mazanderan, the Swedish Sentab Company who are building the Alwaz Bridge and also bridges in Mazanderan and the Netherlands Harbour Works Company who are constructing the No-Shahr harbour and who hoped to obtain a large Contract for the development of Bandar Shahpur. Various Persian contractors/ &gt; Right Honourable Anthony Eden M.C., M.P.&gt; etc. , etc. , etc. , The Foreign Office.contractors were also said to have given 'bribes. Only one British firm was mentioned in the trial hut never, curiously enough, hy name. This was Imperial Chemical Industries Limited. Two of the chief accused, Monsieur Nahavi and Monsieur Movlavi of the Ministry of Communications, were convicted of receiving from Mr. Lubin, the Company’s representative, sums of Rials 27,000 and Rials 7,500 respectively in connection with a contract for explosives. They were convicted on these and other charges and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment each and to fines of Rials 339,500 and Rials 273,500 respectively. Mr. Issa Kooros the Company’s Tehran agent, was convicted of acting as an intermediary for Mr. Lubin, and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. 3. How far the charges connected with Mr. Lubin were well-founded I am unable to say. In March last Mr. Lubin strongly denied the accusations which appear to have been based on statements made by Kooros during preliminary examinations. The defence on these charge appears to have been that Kooros* statements on the subject were contradictory, that no record of the payments appeared in his books and that Mr. Lubin was known always to be borrowing from Kooros for current expenditure and so is not likely to have had available here such large sums to hand over to Kooros for use as bribes, as he is alleged to have done. On behalf of Kooros it was argued that so talented a linguist as Mr. Lubin, who was further well acquainted with many highly/highly placed personalities in Tehran, would have had no need of Kooros’ services as an intermediary in such transac uions. The Court does not appear to have been impressed 'by these arguments# 4. It is interesting that no attempt whatever has been made to prosecute any of the foreigners whose names have 'been mentioned in the proceedings, the excuse apparently 'being that they all most obligingly turned King’s evidence# Most people in Tehran seem to think the accused were guilty and deserved all they got. The only excuse made on their behalf is that they and many other Government servants like them are quite unable on the small salaries they receive to keep up the position they are now practically bound to maintain. They have therefore no alternative but to accept bribes, which they regard more as a payment for services rendered than anything else. 5. The recent trial has received as much publicity as those of Mohamed Ali Mansur and Monsieur Reza Afshar. There have been many references to the acuteness of the Judges’ comments and questions and to the able arguments of counsel on either side. Evidently it was desired to show the world how far the administration of justice has advanced in this country. It remains to be seen whether this series of trials will do anything to raise the standard of honesty in Persian public life. 6 . Shortly after the conclusion of the trial it was announced/announced that Monsieur Sadr, the Minister of Justice had resigned. It is rumoured that he was in fact dismissed because the judges in the present trial had taken hrihes from some of the accused. There is also a story in circulation that the highly respectable Monsieur Reza Quli Hedayat, the president of the Court of Appeal, who presided over the trial of Monsieur Ali Mansour, is being dismissed as well. I have not, hov/ever, been able to obtain any confirmation of this latter rumour and the real reason of Monsieur Sadr’s dismissal must at least remain open to doubt. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India No. 212. I have, etc. for His Majesty’s Charg£ d’Affaires, (Signed) P. N. LOXLEY.COPY &gt;362/12/34) No. 338 L8/19/36). British Legation, Gulhek. 8th August,1936. f ^ — Sir, i . , . • - Since the trial and.sentence of Reza Afshar, reported in my despatch No. 302 of the 13th June last, the public interest in the Road Ministry scandals has Been kept alive hy the publication in the press of detailed statements of the accusations prepared against the various prisoners, beginning with the most important of them, Ali Mansour. (It may be remarked here that the 'Journal de TdKdran called him ”M. Ali Mansour” on the 8th July). The advocates chosen by the accused were also announced. Finally, the trial of the ex-Minister was fixed for Saturday, the 1st August. 2. The proceedings of the trial were reported in the press at great length. Speeches appear to have been reproduced verbatim; and the sudden end of the trial on the 4th August put the Tehran press in some embarrassment; they reproduced the findings of the court at once, but are still reproducing the arguments of counsel, crowded out hitherto for reasons of space. Photographs of the venerable judges in their new robes adorned all the illustrated papers. 3. There were three main counts in the accusation. first concerned the sum of Rials 150,000 alleged to have paid as a 6ri6e to Mansour by the Soci4t«$ Sentah, through the agency of Ali Asghar Taleghani. The principal eviuenct. m support of this charge was the statement of Taleghani The second count stated that certain members of the Ministry had/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.0. , M .P* &gt; etc. , etc . , etc . , The Foreign Office,had t aken 'bribes from the Compagnie Hollandaise in connexion with the construction of the port of No Shahr and that Mohammed Nabavi had been instrumental in arranging that Rials 100,000 of these bribes reached the ex-Minister. The final count alleged that Mansour had caused the Treasury a loss of Rials 900,000 owing to the purchase of a dredger from the Socidte Chichav, the lower tender of another company having been rejected, 4. The Court acquitted the accused on all three counts. The written statement of acquittal says that the evidence in support of the first and second counts was insufficient; and that the Soci^te Chichav’s offer was not to the disadvantage of the Government, as their specifications were for a much superior dredger than that offered by the other company. Therefore M les preuves et arguments pr£sent€s ne paraissant pas ’’suffisantes pour la conclusion d’une cuplabilite^ definitive n de M. Ali Mansour”, he was acquitted, 5. Mansour in his lengthy speeches for the defence had started by saying v/hat an excellent thing it was that under the just rule of the enlightened ruler of Iran everyone had the opportunity of defending himself in a fair and open court. He went on to describe at great length the services which he had rendered to the Iranian nation in various offices. He had had the control of enormous sums; had he wished to steal he could have taken very much larger sums than those in the indictment The evidence was insufficient. had had to build up the Ministry of Roads from very unpromising material and he did the best he could. His advocate, Maliki» was also allowed to make i elaborate defence for his principal. , ~ nnnr &gt;c 1 e been in confinement already for 6. Mansour has of course Demi xu ..

As far as there is any i r . o-r)nears that his acquittal was popular pinion in this country it PI . thp shah, not entity indifferent to show that the bnan, It appearsto -public opinion, has relented in the case of one of his victims. One of my staff has even heard a Persian say that the Shah is made to look rather foolish, and that he should have ordered a proper departmental enquiry before meting out such summary punishment to an important public servant. It will be remembered that the President of the Majlis, Dadgar, disappeared to Europe suddenly last year; I hear now that the Shah wished to clap him in prison too, until the then Prime Minister, Peroughi, argued that it would create a bad impression if the man whose signature adorned almost all the current laws of the country were to be arbitrarily punished; for that reason he was allowed to go. It remains to be seen what punishment will- be awarded to the other prisoners, most of whom everybody believes to have been guilty. And Man sour may even be rewarded by the ’’Journal de Teheran” by his proper370 .)

June 15, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [E 3515/405/34] Copy No. ' ^ Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—(Received June 15.) (No. 271.) Sir, Tehran, Ma,y 28, 1936. I HAVE the honour to enclose herein a copy of a political report on Khuzistan during the last few years from His Majesty’s late consul at Ahwaz. In anticipation of his departure from that post, Mr. Watkinson had just written one invaluable despatch on economic and commercial matters, copies of which are enclosed in my despatch No. 272 of the 28th May. He was engaged on this political companion-piece when he received my instruction to proceed to Khorremabad to enquire into the murder of Mr. E. A. Fear. This and his concluding duties at Ahwaz may have affected the form of the despatch, but it is, I venture to think, full of interesting matter. 2. The reference in paragraph 9 to a decline in the popularity of the Shah and his Government is noteworthy, particularly in view of the economic advance in Khuzistan indicated in the companion despatch of the 18th April. Regret that the Shah’s unpopular dress reforms should be popularly attributed to the instigation of His Majesty’s Government, as is suggested in paragraph 16, may perhaps be legitimately tempered by this reflection, that the popular mind might take things with corresponding lack of surprise and equal resignation if ever the British were driven to exercise again some measure of their old influence in those districts. 3. Other points of interest are the insignificance of the civilian Governor- General as compared with the military and naval commanders, and the difficulties that Jews are now experiencing in Khorramshahr. This can be paralleled in other provinces, and the matter is one that is being watched by this Legation. 4. I should explain a reference in paragraph 8 to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Mr. Watkihson reported in his despatch No. 6, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 78 of the 18th February, that the company closed their clubs throughout the day of His late Majesty’s funeral. In a private letter he explained that this had been done as a result of some pressure on his part. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. NEVILE BUTLER. Enclosure. Consul Watkinson to Mr. Butler. (No. 29. Confidential.) Ahwaz, May \1, ’ WITH reference to your Confidential Circular, No. 6, of the 15th February last, asking for an appreciation of local conditions m this consular district I have the honour to furnish a survey of d ? velc ’P I ? lents A f 193 2 administrative and political field since I arrived at t. hls P'fAA-uth West Iran 2 The n resent reeime has firmly established its power m boutn-west it an since the departure of the Sheikh of Mohammerah ^funreft andbTtherfdw Bakhtiari leaders, by effective military handling ; mea ’ sureg The local introduction of various westernising reforms and ^ ince ntive to rebel, has population naturally inclined to listlessness bable that the Central ss.rorxt's,™™«“»**• ^ - “»■“ ” d o ' [740 p—4]the khans, though its centralising policy certainly antagonises certain sections of the business community. Apart from a few enthusiasts, loyalty to the regime amongst official classes is merely a matter of self-interest and craven fear of being found wanting. A state of terror governs the actions of most officials, who this often write one thing and say or do another. There is no resemblance to th] fervent enthusiasm of the Fascist or the Nazi, whether this be spontaneous oP officially fostered in the apathy of the average Iranian, be he civilian or official. Owing to the presence of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and to the employment provided by the railway, there is comparative prosperity in this province and little time for reflection as to what the Pahlavi regime stands for. It has thus been possible for the country to be organised, controlled and subdued, and for subversive elements to be eliminated for the most part. 3. The Sheikh of Khorramshahr has now long been resident in Tehran and most of his family keep away from this province. Their lands for the most part are confiscated, and all transactions in landed property since Sheikh Khazafs arrest have been declared null and void. Though still permitted to own them, most of their shops and buildings in Khorramshahr and in Ahwaz have been sold. Propaganda in the local press and elsewhere from time to time has compared the sheikh’s absolute and tyrannic rule with the present beneficent and just Pahlavi regime. Whether this has any effect or not, there are probably few who would have any particular reason to welcome a return to former conditions. 4. The power of the Bakhtiari khans has been broken completely. The offices of Illkhani and Illbegi have been abolished and the holder of one of them is now Civil Governor of Bakhtiari, with limited powers and under strict super vision, while most of the remaining leaders have met with sudden death, are imprisoned, or are scattered abroad. They were never popular with their own tribes, who are probably just as happy under the new regime except for the policy of settling them in fixed and sometimes unsuitable localities, and attempted prevention of the winter and summer migration. Inter-tribal squabbles have been settled by military action or by Amnieh, who have also taken over the functions of the Bakhtiari guards at the oil-fields. The burden of taxation is probably no greater than it was under the khans, and the comparative security reigning to-day may outweigh the unpopularity of conscription and of interference with thtm customs. 5. The tribes of Luristan have gradually been subdued by military action and land distributed to them, often at the expense of ikrab owners. Ine construction of the railway has provided employment for large numbers of burs, as has the maintenance of the Khorremabad road. , 6. The Kuhgilu tribes are also subjugated and the district opened up by new roads. , 7. The influence of the present regime on the town-dwellers will be deax with later. Measures against subversive elements have been of the strictes. Various efforts have been reported from time to time to prevent Bahaists Iron obtaining employment with the railway or with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Jews have found conditions impossible in Mohammerah and have left the country, while it was recently rumoured that none were to be allowed to serve in Govern ment offices. Employees at all frontier posts have in the meanwhile been poste in the interior. The power of the mullahs has been curtailed in every way an their number reduced by a system of licensing. 8. Foreign communities have, of course, felt the hand of Tehran just a much as the Iranian, and have perhaps resented it more than the apathetic nati ■ The Iraqis were thus afraid to hold any mourning ceremony at the time ol death of King Feisal. It is to be regretted that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company saw fit to show similar fear of offending the authorities by outward observan ^ at the time of King George’s death. A leading merchant of Ahwaz is saia ^ have refused the appointment of honorary Swedish consul in Ahwaz for rear reprisal on the part of the authorities. , - 9. The Shah’s complete lack of consideration for his officials has e exemplified during the last few years by a personal assault on the A SS1S ,, Director of the Finance Department on the occasion of his last visit here, J frequent announcements of his intention to visit the province and failure ^ so; by sudden transfer or suspension of officials on slender pretexts, such use of the English word ‘ ‘ foot ” in a telegram which happened to contain ^ which displeased His Imperial Majesty; and by the recent dress regulationofficials and insistence on the immediate spending of their small savings on new clothes. Admiration for the Shah and for the blessings conferred by the present regime used to be more freely expressed by officials. Even the General Officer Commanding Troops here has been heard to criticise. It is probable that any popularity which the present Government may have had, or enthusiasm which it i may have inspired, is waning rapidly amongst official classes. 10. Westernising reforms in this part of the country have for the most part s come more slowly than in the north, and have perhaps for that reason been accomplished more easily. 11. During the year 1934 the Khuzistan press was founded. It was suspended for a time owing to the publication of articles about the climate of Ahwaz, and the editor was threatened with severe punishment for his feeble campaign against a Basra newspaper, which suggested that Khuzistan was an Arab province. The reply referred to the ancient capitals of Persia at Ctesiphon and Bagdad, and made no attempt to deny the preposterous assertion that most of the inhabitants of Khuzistan are Arabs, as the authorities expected him to do. A cinema with up-to-date equipment was also established in the Khuzistan Club during the same year. It later became an independent institution, and ‘ ‘ talkies have been shown there since last year. 12. A great deal has been done by the military authorities and by the Education Department to stimulate interest in games and athletics. A football league was organised by the general officer commanding, and teams have been to Tehran from Ahwaz. Flat races have on occasion held up the traffic in the streets. The latest effort is to make the emancipated Iranian woman tennis-minded, a task which seems to be beyond the power even of the general,^ whose word is law in most matters. A sports club has also been established at Khorramshahr. Foi the most part the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have remained aloof from all these things, though the general has endeavoured to persuade them to send football teams to Ahwaz from Abadan, though, “of course, his soldiers or railway employees could not go there for return matches. 13. The first far-reaching reform was the abolition of the Pahiavi nat. Army officers first were seen in a soft kepi, and sun helmets were issued to the lan v and file It was then announced that all persons working in the sun might wear a sun helmet The next effort was on motor drivers, who were instructed to procure peaked caps of European model. Towards the end of 193 / il t he wear i ng: of hats inside offices was forbidden. It was not till the summer of 1935 that ail officials adopted European hats and received instructions not to deal with the public if wearing Pahiavi hats. Regulations were also published as to how to wear and when to remove one’s hat. Various forms P^^nasion wer ® ^ the Governor-General, the police, and the military—but i e . except in isolated instances of remonstrance. Special hats of ( l u ^ n [^ esl fS ordered for tribesmen, and it was found that a Pahiavi ^ at wlt ^ ^.-sfffid thf^ removed made a graceful “ God blimey ” object, which f f a time satisfied the . authorities.

There are now Iranian women clerks working m the National Bank and‘with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and women are seen at all Public functions. They attended an official dinner for the first time on the occasion of the Shah s birthday this year. ., . . Ifi No sooner was the women’s emancipation movement well launched than instructions came through that all officials must immediately obtain correct regulation dress for official occasions and evening wear Those w o had not conformed were excluded from the receptions on the Shah s birthday and at the Nourouz, and note was taken of the names of those who failed to attend. The local notables were advised that they were expected to follow suit and to obtain morning coats, silk hats and evening dress This has probably caused more hard ship and discontent than the previous changes. Local tailors, amongst whom are many Indians, have reaped a golden harvest. It is perhaps partly because of this that it is popularly supposed that His Majesty’s Government is the instigator of the o direct interference with religious observances has been the prohibition of processions at Muharrem for the last three years. Some opposition has been encountered in Dizful and Shushter each year, where the people are less mixed and more fanatical. . . . . i i? -Ti. j 18. The changes of names of scholastic institutions and of military and police titles have been duly imposed on the anxious public, and Mohammerah has become Khorramshahr, while a dozen small villages have been renamed. T ^se changes have not been adopted too rigidly or rapidly. Considerable trouble has been caused to European institutions and firms by the substitution of the word Iran for Persia or its equivalent in European languages. This has necessitated the changing of the names of the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation and the Persian Transport Company, and of various other non-Iranian organisations, but they have accepted with as good a grace as possible a quite unwarrantable interference by the Iranian Government with the mother tongue of many millions of foreigners. 19. The local administration during the past three years has been a kaleidoscope of varying efficiency and honesty. Governors-General and Governors at Khorramshahr and Abadan have come and gone. The first two Governors- General known to the writer were ex-diplomats. Both came to grief owing to peculations of subordinates. Since then former officials of the Finance Depart ment have held the post, who have shown less social acumen, but have perhaps been the better administrators. In practice, the General Officer Commanding Troops has been the power behind, when not in front of, the scene throughout this period. None of the Governors has ever entertained distinguished visitors, Iranian or foreign, who are accommodated in a special railway bungalow or imposed upon the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In case after case the Governor- General has shown a complete ignorance of what is going on in other Departments, supposedly under his supervision. The military and naval authorities for the most part treat him with disdain and fail to give him any information or help, while the chief of police on occasion has told a Governor-General to attend to his own affairs. The precise duties of a Governor-General seem to be undefined. Apart from appearance on official occasions and occasional inspections of the more accessible parts of the district, he is merely a post office for communication with higher or other authorities, and has plenty of time to devote to collection of funds for social, charitable and industrial purposes—earthquakes, hoods, school excursions, beggars, swimming baths, factories—-and for exhorting the public to form companies, to organise industries, and generally to put themselves under the control of the authorities in their development schemes. 20. The Deputy-Governor usually acts as Rais-i-Belledieh, as do the sub-Governors of Abadan and Khorramshahr. Since various regrettable incidents in 1933 connected with road-making, municipal services have been maintained as well as funds permit. In Ahwaz the roads have been kept m a tolerable state of repair and decently clean, though reports from Khorramshahr have complained constantly of the state of the one main road through the town. Many new and better houses have been built after submission of plans to the Belledieh. New official premises were at one time under construction surrounded by a high wall, on which 80,000 rials were said to have been spent. This was solemnly inaugurated by the Governor-General in the presence of all the officials, but work was suspended the following; week, under instructions from Tehranthat all Government buildings must be on the right bank of the River Karun. A municipal hospital is now being built there. An ambitious town-planning scheme is also being carried out in connexion with the opening of a road to approach the new bridge over the Karun, which is almost completed by the Societe Sentab. It is probable that the bridge will be finished before any approach to it exists at either end. This has necessitated the demolition of the building occupied by the Customs Department, and has created great confusion and congestion in the customs. 21. The only dealings of this consulate with the Belledieh have been in connexion with prohibited goods confiscated wrongfully from an Indian. This was never settled owing to the Indian’s death, but the judicial authorities have agreed that the cloth forms a part of the estate, and it was recently sold by auction and the proceeds are held pending issue of letters of administration: 22. Though nominally under control of the Governor-General, the police take a line of their own and seek any inspiration required from Tehran. Their administration generally leaves much to be desired, though there are spasmodic attempts at traffic control and inspection of the bazaars. Dealings with the public often require much palm-oil, and it is suspected that many of the robberies in the town are carried out with the connivance of the police if not by them. Unnecessary difficulties were made by the police for American aviators at Khorramshahr and for French planes which made forced landings in Ahwaz and Abadan. The procuring of exit visas by foreign subjects is frequently a long and tedious business. This consulate has had to make representations at different times about the arrest and detention of Indians, impounding of passports, non-recognition of proper travel documents, limitation of the period of validity of residence permits and abnormal delay in their issue, confiscation of guns, refusal to give facilities in connexion with immigration and visa regulations, and the issue of licences for guns. In the first case the arrests were made without warrant, and houses were searched contrary to the provisions of Safeguard No. 6. 23. The present Chief Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police was refused permission to land at Khorramshahr last year because he was not in possession of a visa, which he had failed to obtain owing to the Iranian consulate at Karachi being closed. Though his identity as ex-Colonial Governor was explained, the chief of police insisted that he must continue his journey to Basra and obtain a visa there. Similar difficulties have been encountered by diplomatic representatives, who are told that no police facilities can be given to persons with diplomatic passports. (Local Governors also say that they can only grant facilities if specially authorised.) 24. The military and naval administration, so far as the public is concerned is looked upon as more efficient, and therefore more to be feared than the civil Departments. Under the forceful personality of General Mu ini, conscription and enforcement of the Government’s wishes in all matters are carried out ruthlessly, while the navy, under the equally autocratic control of Colonel Bayandor, lays down the law about navigation on the Karun, and all services at the port of Khorramshahr, and carries out half-hearted measures against smugglers. The discipline and appearance of the army are excellent. I he navy shows signs recently of deterioration. Commandeering of transport a,nd supplies are occasionally reported, but such incidents are not frequent. The incidents o the arrest of Captain Macleod for the alleged offence of forcing his way on board H.I.M.S. Palanq in 1933 to arrange for pilotage under the Basra Fort Regulations and the arrest of Mr. Brewster in 1934 for insulting behaviour to a sailor are the only serious instances of interference with a British subject qv e naval authorities, while the military authorities, so far as is known, ave a c ean sheet. . oi. + 4 - i 25. Owing to their refusal to conform to the rules m force in the bhatt-el- Arab, there have been several collisions narrowly averted which might have endangered British ships and lives. When the dangers of this or o ocyin^ r channels have been pointed out to Colonel Bayandor his replies have been insolent. So far as Iranian waters are concerned, entire control has been g^en to Coloimi Bayandor, who thus exercises civil jurisdiction m many matters which haid y seem to be a naval concern. No interference by the police oi , admitted, as the navy say that they themselves are °^ tsld ® the , R nls // t ^ civil authorities. It is only recently that the naval authorities, aftei constai t I i, i a Tvcninn Oil Company, have stored some of their ammunition in^ safe? jdace on shore xnstead of keeping it all in the magaz^es of the sloops.

Their terms are less elastiZhan those of the Imperial Bank of Iran, and the transaction of busitmss i^fXfXtiatiw”'Lrts is comparattvely satisfactory once cases have actually come up for hearing. The preliminary proceedings are interminable and there are many abuses. Satisfactory decisions have been gwen in all cases known to the consulate where a British subject has been involved, but it seems to be impossible to work the machinery for releasing estates of decease foreign subjects. The president of the high court once stated that m no case would a British subject be sentenced to a term of imprisonment longer purchasable by a cash payment until such time as the local prisons had been reorganised. 1 This has been adhered to, and very light sentences imposed on British subjects found guilty of serious criminal offences. 29. Public health is adequately safeguarded. Quarantine restrictions aie imposed regularly against Indian ports and Iraq when necessary. Compulsory vaccination has been insisted upon at times. The streets of the towns are usual y swept and their use as latrines limited as much as possible. -New and better houses have been built. In Ahwaz a municipal hospital is m course oi construction. , 1 30. The Education Department has achieved considerable developments m the last three years. The number of schools has increased and existing ones enlarged. A high school for teachers is nearly finished in Ahwaz. 31. The Post and Telegraph Department is slow but reasonably sure_ Kates for foreign mail and for telegrams, and particularly for air mail are exorbitant!} high as compared with rates in other countries. Thus an air mail k^ ter y 5 London costs 5-50 rials, as compared with 3d. from London to Basra, let tne mail is only brought by air as far as Basra, and no internal air mail exists noi any organisation for expediting air mail correspondence from the interior o Iran to Basra or Bagdad. Inland telegrams are dealt with promptly, but recently telegrams to Iraq have been sent via Khaniqin, so that one to Basra may take two days. _ ■ 32. The Railway Administration has been dealt with in the economi report submitted recently. Its dealings with the public are none too friend!}, and much difficulty is caused by the priority given to military requirements. 33. The relations of all these Departments with this consulate and witn British subjects in general have been fairly satisfactory in official matters. Socia intercourse as times have gone on has become less and less possible. I have, &amp;c. A. E.

In the old days the difficulty of comunioations «eant that such provinces *er« bound to be left very much to theaselvos ( 2 ahidan is over 1100 miles from Sehraa); to-day these provinces are not merely faced with an unpopular policy, but with the deadweight of a more powerful fist than they have ever come up againe k before, g.

After seven years in sSast Bereia he has formed the oonoluaion that the Iranian Government would prefer not only that ignoranee of the Persian language should restriot the eapaoity of His Majesty's Consular Of fleers to understand a local situation, but that at present, in order to protest British Interests efficiently, these officer* must incur unpopularity. 'Phis feeling that friendly relations can only be secured by an easy-going inertia, and are theraiore in present circumstances not worth seeking, finds some response in British circles outside Khorasean. I am disposed -o agree that given the present attitude of the authorities towards British Officials in Bast Iran, those who protect British in- : terests with vigour cannot hope to be popular with the author ; ities - in fact the very word popular seems inap P n**Uto j during the existing semi-boycott. At the same tim8 strongly that a spirit of understanding is as n-;on-r.ir 4 I seal, and that the situation requires men who are efficient and animated by a firm determination to uphold British m,er » j *ho, at the same time, possess a friendly manner of p ! r t-o^'rards the authorities* 10 . one feels bound to consider Colonel Laly's conviction in a wider application. Without detracting from the aucoee, achieved in their thankless work by His 0oaexil&amp;T Officers in East Iran, and indicated by the recent absence fresh incidents, it cannot reasonably be doubted that the wo of His Majesty's late Minister has contributed to -his, , Gluttons in Tehran and elsewhere, has coincided with improved relations *u .v hare is an endeavour to A principal interest in th* **achieve an admittedlf difficult reooncileBient between the defence of British interests ana the preparation of the ground for future good relatione between Great Britain, India and Iran* Much of Colonel Daly*a appreciation is of course true 11 . outside the confines of East Persia though even there it is perhaps a penetrating critique rather than an 'appreciation' of what the Shah has done* f £o obtain a good picture of the country as a whole, I suggest that his paper be read in con~ junction with an address given to the loyal Institute of Inter* national Affairs last aufuiBn (and since published in its Journal) by Mr. Cecil idwarde who has fcnown other parts of Persia inti* mately over a number of years. nevertheless, Colonel Paly 1 s paper remains an indictment sufficiently formidable to confirm misgivings as to the future (though it is interesting and per* haps almost encouraging that Sant Persia, where the regime is so markedly unpopular, should also be the region in * 'rsia relations with this country and India are easily at their worst.) It is true that the Shah has the final word in everything of im portance and that improvement of relations in Ia«t Persia and elsewhere depends upon his goodwill. Nevertheless I would ven* ture to revert to an opinion expressed in the paragraph of my despatch So. £19 already referred to, that there my be advantage in His Majesty* a Legation not being the Shah's close confidante, more nartioularly from the fact that Persian opinion already tends to associate the Legation unduly with his regime.

Gonsulate Gsneral For Khorasan, He shad (Kast Iran). An Appreciation of the Political Situation in East Iran. fhe power of the present regime tends to increase - that Is to say the driving power from lehr an is becoming increasingly felt in the remote provinces, and extends to the entire population. Ibis driving power Is - Fear, and is not fear of the Government, of the law, or of Public Opinion, but fear of the Shah himself. r fhat this fear has oecome so widespread is due primarily to the frequent examples afforded the public. High officials fall from grace and are humilated, imprisoned or execut ed. Whatever may be the grounds for such punishment - they may often be the jealousy and intrigues of other officials - all classes, official and civilian, ascribe the downfall sol4r to the Shah. Officials and others, not unnaturally, have come to feel that in a land where even the highest cannot protect themselves, there is little hope for the humble, should they fall foul of His Imperial Majesty, or of one of the higher officials who himself is farced, from fear of Ifce consequences, to ruthlessly carry out what he conceives to be the policy of his Royal Master. 2. Up till a year or t»o ago, provincial officials and oiviliana viewed witb. some awe tae downfall of one personage after another in the capital t 'they were n greatly affected thereby. Tehran was atill a long way off and most Ministers were corrupt, and deserved all they got. More recently, however, unpleasant events have occurred aarer home. In Meshed last year large ntlm bers were slain y troops within the precints of the Holy Shrine of nam Hi Z a - the one place, short of Heaven, in which everyShiah in Iran probably thought he would be safe from physical violence. He might well have understood that he would be 1 dealt with* in due course, but could scarcely contemplate that blood would be shed within the Shrine. This ccmfartable belief, combined with the feeling that there was safety in numbers, undoubtedly encouraged the crowd which gathered in the Shrine. They felt that their agitation was ’ c anstituti anal 1 , or at least sanctioned by age-long custom,and that the method selected - that of airing their grievances in the Shrine - could not fail to attract the personal attention of His Majesty the Shah and to result in alievation of their troubles• There was no determined threat to the present regime. The movement was the result of continued economic pressure which was at that time strangling the middle classes and the poor. v for sane time new laws had appeared almost as fast as the printing presses could produce them - and had been interpreted, as it suited the local officials who administered them,with entire laoU of sympathy wiill the public, or of understanding of the X objects which the laws were framed to achieve. The public had formed the opinion that this state of aftairs was due almost entirely to the officials and not directly to the Shah. In this they were probably correct - tney bact not ,et learnt that in the administration of the law, officials were driven to harshness by an unreasoning fear, and in taxation,if they collected a little 'present' for themselves in accordance with long established oustom, fear made them collect the full government dues in addition - a quite recant innovation. If in the oast the taxpayer had been required to bribe the tax collector, the latter at least oonniywi in his swindling the treasury. the tax-collector is ariven by fear to collect the full taxation, or even more, and the taxpayer must bribe, not to escape his liaoilites, V avoid utter ruin at the hands of the rapacious officials. A 'A 3. Suffering from what they deemed to be unjust disabiliUe \ / SlVi ri %-Si an d believing tnat it vsould only be necessary to get the ear of the Shah to obtain some redress, the common people songht means of approach to the throne. Telegrams and petitions remained unanswered. There are some grounds for believing that the clergy may have offered encouragement to the scheme for a grand demonstration in the Shrine of Imam Beza. If it 'were successful it would enhance the glory of the Shrine in I the minds of simple persons,and some of the glory must extend to the clergy-servants of the Shrine. There can be no doubt that this reversion to old-time habit was most embarrassing for the Government. To have to give way in fhce of such a demonstration would have been most damaging - to neglect it might well have encouraged more widespread disaffection and a resort to violence. By good handling °f this situation the Shah might have gained considerabl© popularity. revolutionary movement had started, and no actual opposition to the present regime was mooted* ttas agitators cursed local officials whom they deemed guilty of bad administration,ana appealed to God and the Shah to redress their wrongs. There | was no demonstration of violence . 4 . Commonsen.se should hare dictated that the first necessity was to oalm the excited crowd. ^ f® w hundred soldiers,out of a garrison of thousands, /oould have „u * i A-van r*nn 1 d have n the crowd into submission. $ omen ana chi left the building .and the principal agitators «ight nave oe«n tafcen into custody pending an enquiry. Thereafter .had toe 3 hah taicen the opportunity to conduct an enquiry, or Meshed himself as was confidently expected hy the crowded to grant some relief from the burdens which were crushing the people, he would have gained a measure of popular'•t. he has not enjoyed for many years. Such a display of for bearanoe was not forthcoming, and the local authorities could thin* of no better solution than for troops to approach the mosque at midnight.and having shot indiscriminately into the /crowd |U il \J, icrowd, to retire to their barracks without effectively dispersing the people or arresting the principal agitators* 5. Such is the simplicity of the humble Shorassanis, that even after this demonstration of cruelty, they still held to their belief that the Shah would punish the officials responsible for bloodshed and desecration of the Shrine. When some nights later, troops surrounded the building and mowed down men,women and children,with machine guns, they were disillusioned. It is true that they were also cowed, and have since remained cowed because on every occasion for which there is an excuse,® display of force takes place in Meshed and troops parade the town as if it were under martial law. Kevertheless,it would be a rash person who would venture to suggest that the Khorassanis have forgotten dbe events of last year, or will not, on a favourable opportunity presenting itself, be among the first to join any movement embarrassing to the present regime. That the Shah realises this,and judges the strength of public feeling that these incidents have aroused seems probable. It was to save face that a scapegoat had to be found and for which &amp;sadi the Mu taw alii-Bash!,after torture which it is said produced the necessary confession, was duly executed. Iranian in East Iran - not even Asadi f s enemies and he bad many,believe that he had any hand in the disturbances. 6 . It might be supposed that civilians woulo. expect to reasonably safe if they eschewed politics ana popular year has seen a reorganisavi uu a efficiency of the si police agents were organisation and great increase in /officialsand leading civilians. 1 'hey could be bribed should necessity arise. Now the ramifications of the secret police are such that no man can trust his neighbour. No official of high rank dare exercise proper control over his juniors,among whom there may be special*informers’ who could secretly report against him. No official therefore dare take the slightest responsibility, for he might be a ^exceeding his power. On the other hand,every official must carry out,with zeal amounting to harshness or rapacity,the orders of the Central | Government,however unpalatable, lest he be reported secretly I as half-hearted in support of the Shah’s Government. Whereas formerly the secret police were under the direct c caitrol of the Provincial Chiefs of Police,their numoers are now added to by 'informers’ appointed by some authority in lehr an. Phe se informers are to be found in all wai £s of lifs and in all government departments. Phey report direct to Tehran,and report also on the actions of the local police, on the principle of 'smaller fleas have smaller fleas' etc. That such a system undoubtedly exists may be deduced from the fact that local officials are now quite frequently dismissed from service under orders from Tehran. It has always been common for such action to be taken as the result of reports ^ from local superiors,or as a result of quarrels among the officials, but the grounds are known locally in such oases. Sudden dismissal ordered from Tehran.,can but oe the resu secret reports,and such action keeps all in constant fear of loss of livelihood or worse. In short.it woula be difficult to find in Hast Iran any class ,or any persons, who have feelings other than hatred for the present *uler. ^ exceptions may possibly be found among a handful of up officials who owe all to the present regime,and whose Position . + ^ TTh aT r si’s few in number ,and enables them to acquire riches. ^it i* probable that even they must live in constant terror - it F ivjuiaw / oftenoften asic themsolyes yshetiier the game is vsorth the candle. 7 . On the occasion of the demise of our late King,Major Campbell our Vice -Consul at Z&amp;hidan, heard a well-informed Iranian say rt If the Shah of Iran should die,his subjects would he so happy that they would forget to bury him 11 . On the same occasion, a person of some importance said to a member of my staff at 2iabul, *&amp;ing Seorge was not our Sing, ... but we mourn his death as a just Buler. Iranians would have rejoiced if their King had been taken instead*. 8 . The public attitude of Iranian officials towards His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officers is now everywhere one of frigid aloofness. This attitude is undoubtedly the result of fear in most cases. Mothing is more dreaded than a secret report to Tehran that an official is suspected of being pro-British. IndividnslXy nearly every official of importance wfflnld lite to be friendly - there are certain exceptions at Meshed, but the reason s not far to seeh. Such exceptions would prefer to be friendly with the Russians and their private inclinations merely coincide with off Ua, policy,when they lose no opportunity to be unfriendly to us. Possibly most officials are looiing ahead,and imagine a time may come when once more they must try to be accepted as oro- Ruesian or pro-British. 10 *e the former necessitates qualifying now,by showing disli® of the British; to attain the latter,they consider it sufficient not to jo out way to be unfriendly to us,since they count on our under standing that they are precluded from ooeniy shewing frien* ship in any form. Major Oampbell.who has a good toowledge of the language and a particular flair for penetr hp is on quite friendly terms tortuous minds, reports that he is ^ n n-p Makran (who has always oeen with the govern or-General of Mekran ..ll-aiapoa.d to.was a,J t»at the tatter tee *• IhStruetlOhe te f.rhia other *» *•« , “* / CJ-8 that have taken place f all of which they are apt to classify as progress’. European dress increased facility of travel, troops and police in uniform and everywhere in evidence,wide straight avenues in the towns, railways and aeroplanes etc., combine to complete the impression, fhere is .however, a proverbial fly in this brilliant ointment, although it requires perhaps kb ener eyesight than the average tourist possesses to discern it. The cost at which this ’modernise- tion* or ’westernisation’ is being obtained constitutes Indeed a ’fly* of more than average dimension - to many keen observers it amounts to little less than the ultimate financial ruin of the country. Ihe condition of the labouring classes has (and this is be coming rapidly more evident) deteriorated under crushing taxation on every necessity of life, hn increase of petty crime is everywhere reported, the lot of merchants is little better. Their prosperity has decreased, and the rate of decrease has been particularly accelerated by the wholesale interference with private trade shich is nos taking place. They see no prospect other than to become Ooramission agents for,or employees in,the Monopoly Companies 3 uoh as are so fortunate as still to possess any capital see no profitable employment for it. i'ney can invest shares of the Monopoly Companies .but the majority regard such investments as a forced capital levy by the Sovernment. - fee 'Directors' in Tehran may reap rich rewards - investors in the provinces expect only to lose the value of the shares iy have taken as a matter of policy . Agriculture has been most adversely affseted by the icpoly of grain. In Sistan all wheat is purchased by the rernment at the rate of about 70 or 80 Rials per Kharvax, ile at Zahidan,136 miles distant,such gram is retailed by e Government at ten times the price. 'The monopoly of aln is threatened in the Gainst, although i&gt;. has not ? , « 4 +• i*&gt; 2 » c&lt; never been an impoj- tiant en put into effect, as it has nev©igrain producing area. Keyerthe less the transport of grain to other provinces is prohibited and this ,combined with the monopoly threat .has had the ef^ct of greatly decreasing the area under wheat and barley. fhe cultivation of poppies for opium this season has correspondingly increased. 11. The administration of the &amp;rmy appears to be slowly increasing in efficiency,or it might be more correct to say that the total lack of efficiency is being partially remedied. Whether the efficiency of the army as a fighting machine is increasing cannot be Judged. In the province of Meisran.where affairs are very greatly in the hands of the local military commanders,there is lack of co-operation between the commanders and the military Govern or-(general of the province. The latter is regarded as an officer In civil employ and is manifestly not sure of his position vis-a-vis his purely military colleagues. The matter of the command eering of lorries of British subjects in December 19555 is an example of this lack of co-operation* The Govemor-General was undoubtedly anxious to acquire transport in a regular manner .but was not ©onsulted by the military commander could not control him.

It is generally expected that contraband trade will increase as the strangle-hold of the Monopoly Gomp&amp;nies destroys private trade. In the Zafcidan area there are already signs of greater activity. It now pays to smuggle out of Iran as well as into the country on a barter basis 12 . It is anticipated that the rising generation of Iranians will shortly provide a problem which,unless great economic changes ta&amp;e place,must ultimately prove a source of embarrass ment to the Government, i'he jioung lads in the towns are being rapidly Westernised 1 . Ihis,as a rule,includes an inclination to fine clothing,cinemas,and a generally more expensive habit of living than has hitherto been encouraged. On a rising wave of prosperity no difficulties need arise from such a social change, but prosperity of the private individual is to all appearances on the ebb. Young men see no hope except in some official appointment. On the other hand there are already signs that the multiplication of officials has reached a point at which the difficulty of providing salaries enforces a halt. In many departments Juniors have been dismissed recently on the grounds of economy, fhe A rmy conscripts are to serve an rxtra y©ai to provide the Police force. Agriculture offers no prospects to the semi-educated youth of the towns. Those whose parents oym landed property see the value of such property rapidly deer easing, si nee taxation eats into the profits, '^ith the outward trappings of Westernisation,there is springing up among these young men an inquisitiveness as to social and political conditions in oth r countries. Somehow or other,in spite of an efficient pre censorship,they begin together sufficient information to cause a critical altitude towards affairs in their own country. om time in the not very distant future,this body of youth will provs an unruly element ,which unlixe ignorant masses demonstrating in a Shrine ,cannot be dispersed with machine guns,and may well prove / hlanger ousso. 311 British Legation {1X1/11/36) i- J q &gt; ^ vj ,q 15th June 1936 in jour despatch MO^06 (1 ^438/727^34) of May 11 th, you enclose-.: copies of a despatch addressed to His Majesty*s Consul at Atoms* authorising hi * to instruct His Majesty*s Tiee- Consul at Xhorr&amp;mshahr to make certai.n investigation® on behalf of the Standard Marine Insursnice Company into questions arising out of the fire last year in the Khorrsmshahr customs house I have now received a despatch from hr. «?odd enclosing a report from Captain aaz&amp;lgette on the state of affairs prevailing in the Khorramshahr customs, This report was evidently written prior to the receipt of your instruct ions and I have the honour to enclose a copy aa I feel that it will provide your department with an interesting background to the answers to the enquiries of the insurance company which you will in due course be receiving fro® Captain Buzalgette* 8 .

I found myself in general agreement with his conclusions. , , ^ ^ , 2 I would only observe that, as regards the Province of lars, it, as appears to be the fact, the power of the tribes is broken and concentrated action from them is unlikely, this does not enable the Government to relax its vigilance. Amnieh patrols are very numerous. . , . . 3 . Mr. Hoyland levels two charges against the provincial administration : that the junior officials are of a poor type, and that the officials generally are quite unready to accept responsibility without reference to Tehran. The first point has also been made in the introductory remarks m the annual report for 1935 and would be admitted by many Iranians, but it is reasonable to hope that quality will improve along with the general amelioration of the standard ot education. The second point—the reluctance to accept responsibility is a familiar and discouraging feature of consular work in other provinces besides 4 .

' BEFORE leaving Iran, after a residence of over five years in Kermanshah and Shiraz, I have the honour to submit a brief report on my impressions during that perlod^Th^ci in Persia (to which name the Government had not yet discovered any objection) at the time when the ou caD an d of towards Westernisation was seen in the adoption o „ -Lad not taken kindlv European dress for townsmen. The Kermanshah popu a 10 attitude to the to the change, but accepted conditions with the traditional c^ strong man. A year later the Shah, whilst on a visi ° P iyp rmaIls hahan estates at Shahabad (ex Harunabad), savaged the . ove Abdullah Mirza because he had seen villagers without the Pahlavi cam A ss 'h Mirz^ Shahab-ud-Dowleh, K.C.V.O., only just avoided dismi sal by Sovereign that these men were outside his govern 3. I leave Iran having seen the discarding^ of the^P ad lavi cap imposition of the European dress m ^ ^^^ately The measure has been of towns, villages, hamlets and hov e ls 1 mi ii tarv with every means in their imposed by officials, police, and even by P nrnnleted is the unveiling of power. The more noticeable change not yet ^sttht h c hu dd u' T? If the the women, with the officially inspired campaign g WO manhood in adopting Persian press is full of accounts of the ardour or [740 c—4]the new dress it naively omits to note that there are to-day in the provinces only a very few women to be seen in public. Prejudice against unveiling and the lach of means of providing any form of European dress account for this. 4 I believe that the policy of presenting the Persian to appear outwardly as a European is inspired by the hope that he will acquire inwardly those good , niialities of the West which will lead to his national and personal improvement. Iut “ plus 5 a Change, plus c’est la meme chose ” is true of the majority. The Fast moves slowly. Yet if the change had not been forced upon the people in haste it could not have been imposed at all. The Persian, given a delay, would ha c hoped for some intervention before the expiration of the time-lmnt. 5. Government in the present form and under the strong ruler seems firmly established A soldier himself, the Shah is said to have full control of the army, and whilst he commands the only field from which a rival may rise there seems no danger to him from any other direction. 6 Complaints are heard against Government from time to time. These are the inevitable result of measures to secure increased revenue for the needs of the fighting services and of the civil administration. The merchant class in general is dissatisfied with the restrictions on trade and the intervention of Government as a trader But as individuals many recognise that they are paying in taxation no more than they and their fathers paid to the Prince Governors-General m the past. Also that they are now living under more favourable conditions of security. And all educated classes realise with pride that the work of progress has been carried on without binding the country with foreign loans. 7. The mujtahid and ulema are the class most affected by the new regime. The large revenue they derived as civil registrars has been lost to them with the foundation of the Registration Department. The abolition of public religious practices, such as the Muharrem ceremonies, &amp;c., and the studied indifference shown towards religion are depriving them of all influence and prestige. As a class they are a potential danger to the regime if a strong leader should appear from their ranks. The ruler is well aware of this and will take measuies to guard against it. . 8 . My impression is that the Shah commands the fear of all his subjects, and in the East this means their allegiance and respect. His work in waking up the country and of pulling out the fighting services and the civil administration from the ruts of indifference and sloth is recognised by all. His policy tor industrial development is admired. The activities which have made him the largest landowner and industrialist in Iran and the large fortune he has acquired receive no condemnation. In fact, I am convinced that he would have earned the odium of his subjects if he had failed to take advantage of his opportunities. 9. Even in the provinces one gathers the impression that great progress has been achieved in the army. The men are better equipped, armaments have been improved, and the physical and material conditions of the private now receive attention. But all the old conditions have not disappeared, and one hears ot officers who derive a benefit from public moneys passing through their hands. 10. The road guards service has been extended and is being increased m Ears. Security exists, with a few incidents in the remoter districts. Complaints are heard occasionally against the exactions of the Amnieh upon villagers. Ihese are probably smaller than the revenue levied upon the same people by tribal , chieftains in the past. 11 . The police services in the towns appear efficient and the discipline of tne force is good. Burglaries are on the decrease. 12. The civil administration in all its branches has made large strides towards efficiency, but many of the services are still backward. The difficulty appears to lie in the lack of attraction to the educated young man of the lowei ranks of this service. The pay and conditions here are poor. The junior officials are therefore, as a rule, persons of little education who are marking time in tne position until they can find more remunerative employment elsewhere. 13. It is not easy either to find suitable candidates for the higher ranks, e.g., heads of departments, assistant Governors, &amp;c., and many of those holding the positions are venal unless under immediate control. I have heard the la e Governor-General of Ears complain that the difficulty in administration was tn lack of sufficient trustworthy men. His Excellency Majid Khan Ahy was himse a very good type of the modern senior Persian official. Educated at the ^ s ® ia school in Tehran, he studied law in Russia and was a Judge of Appeal beio3 me to tit I; ie for leu ’chant class ij mntionoffii we pajiigit vernors-U conditiiifl. d by lei: ilost total, on of piti re studied n :e and prestf r leader tai takeiM® 'jiisopport# ihatgreiff' ; arma®*- ie priva^ red. dV ironghtto; lisbeiag^l districts; t; upon fllyj same pcf' coming to Ears. A conscientious, honest and hard-working official, he was the very opposite to his successor, Abul Rath Mirza, Dowlat Shahi, a pleasing individual but a confirmed gambler and spendthrift. But the latter is a repre sentative of the class which owes position to rank and influence. I imagine that he will not hold his position for long, as he is being hard pressed by creditors. 14. I have not heard many reports showing the working of the Adliyeh. But efforts have been made to improve the status of the judges and I know of no case of flagrant injustice. 15. The worst public service appears to be the Post Office, the staff being not only backward but inadequate. The telegraph services have not been brought up to date for external work. In Shiraz the whole routine of the office depends upon one man, an Armenian formerly of the I.E.T. Department staff. 16. Good and steady progress is being made with education and the Persian youth of both sexes is now receiving a very fair elementary and middle-course education, including physical drill. 17. Many improvements have been made in communications during the last five years. Roads are being maintained and reconstructed. Mechanical transport, on which traffic depends, is under stricter control and the traveller is provided with up-to-date transport. Omnibus services between Bushire-Shiraz- Isfahan cater for the more moderate purse. 18. Town improvements on a fair scale have been undertaken during the last six years and most towns now possess a large central avenue. In Shiraz street-making is in progress and sections of the old bazaar are being done away with for the object. The most noticeable work is in Isfahan, where some 500 houses have been pulled down recently for the northern extension of the Chahar Bagh Avenue, which will now be joined to the Tehran road. Work of restoration has been undertaken in the Maidan. It is hoped to reconstruct this on the original plan. The madrasseh and the masajid are being suitably repaired. The town now has eight spinning-mills, and the construction of further factories is in contemplation. 19. I am not touching upon commercial, economic or industrial questions in this short report. References to these subjects were made in my summary of events and conditions in the Province of Ears for the year 1935. 20. During my stay in Persia I have seen the disarming of the tribes m Kurdistan and the consequent revolt of the Jaf chieftain, Ja afar Sultan. This took nearly two years to quell and was followed by the troubles in Luristan. Here the disturbances were due to attempts by Government to settle the Lurs m other districts. The Qashqai and Khamseh tribes had been disarmed befoie my arrival in Ears, and the last revolt of the Qashqai chieftain, Ali Khan, had been suppressed. Saulat-ud-Dowleh had only just died in a Tehran prison, and the Qavam-ul-Mulk was residing in the capital, as were the principal relatives ot both chiefs. The rigid control of the tribes under Military Governors has continued ever since and the project of settlement of the tribes in defined areas, with the abolition of the annual migrations, is materialising. All these measures are aimed at the breaking-up of the tribal system. I have not heard of any strong personality likely to come forward to claim the tribal chieftainship it tne opportunity should occur. . ^ T • 21 . I have had few relations with private individuals and officials in general as these are all prohibited from approaching me. Any P 618 ^ 11 0 T? ® having business with me must first of all explain it to the police. e a ions the Governor-General, the municipality and the police, whom I can approach freely, have been excellent and I have both personally and o cia y re most ready and courteous assistance . Gove ™ 01 ^ however, a consul’s official relations with Persian officials are ^f p aGs h f ^ t p ° v r J r Few of these officers will assume any responsibility and ev ® r y ’ ^ small, must first be referred to the capital.

Their commercial activities, too, appeal o consider that the Soviets have any influence m r ars.23. I believe that the average Persian knows of two foreign nations only the Russian and the British. To most classes present conditions in the U.S.S.R are an unsolvable puzzle, but, apart from this, I do not think that any Persian feels any sympathy for that country. A friendly feeling for Great Britain does exist, but the educated and the Nationalist have not forgotten the Anglo-Russian Agreement. In Pars, too, the formation and maintenance of the South Persia ' Rifles is still fresh in memory. Our prestige here depends solely upon our foreign policy in general. 24. And in conclusion. I am convinced that the present regime will continue with benefit to country and people during the lifetime of the present ruler so long as he retains his mental and physical powers. It would require a bold prophet to forecast conditions at his disappearance, either in the fulness of time or before. I have, &amp;c. H. A. D.

Sir, in continuation of paragraphs 6 and 7 of my despatch No, 160 of the 3rd April last, I have the honour to report that Reza Afshar has been tried in the High Court of Appeal and has been sentenced to six months imprisonment, to a fine amounting to twice the sum which the court found that he had received as a bribe, and to the deprivation of the right to serve in future as a servant of the Government. Yfog proceedings received remarkable publicity* The vernacular press and the Journal de T&amp;i£ran filled many columns with detailed reports of the proceedings* Photographs of the public prosecutor making his speech, of the public leaving the court, and of the judges in their magnificent new robes were published. The only previous instance of such a detailed report in recent years that X can discover is the trial of Teymourtache. 5 ^ I do not propose to report at any length the very prolix arguments used by the proaecution and the defence. The prosecution's case was, briefly, that Afshar, when Minister of Hoads and Communications, had demanded from Issa Kooros, eventually received, a bribe of 32,000 rials in respect of certain orders for explosives placed with Root os. It alleged that Afshar had confessed his guilt m a petition to the Shah. Another accusation was that the orders had been „ ~e-n fnv oublic tender which the placed without the previous call for puo law/ tight Honourable, ithony Eden, M.C.» M.P* * etc•, etc . , etc. , The Foreign Office.I law requires. The defence » conducted by Dr. Aghayan and by the accused in person, is difficult to follow from the published record; the lawyer seems to have confined himself to certain minor points relating to dates and to various quibbles of little importance. It is interesting to note that what the accused said was more to the point. Although the French text of the Journal de T^h^ran reported a good deal of the Persian text from the vernacular press, certain omissions were made. The Persian text states that Afshar said that he was induced to write his petition to the Shah by one of the examining magistrates, who had not only drafted the petition himself in three different ways, but had himself added certain important words to the petition. The final petition was thus different from what Afshar himself had agreed to and the Court was asked, by the accused, to consider whether it was not a dishonest action on the part of the Police de Sdretd first to suggest a form of petition and then alter it, and to copy it before it reached the Shah. It is interesting that this part of Afshar’s remarks was not considered suitable for the consumption of those who are unable to read Persian. 3. The sentence of six months (part of which has already been served) does not seem severe. Issa Kooros was not called in person. I suppose the main point of the trial was to show how modern and western Iranian justice has suddenly become. I have no further news, however, of the other imprisoned persons. They are presumably still languishing m prison and it is practically impossible to discover any further news of the investigations which are no doubt going on. The fact that a • i v. irot taken place may perhaps confirm a spectacular trial has not yet tak.n pia j +■ r*ase against Ali Mansur is rumour which I have heard, that the case aga difficult to substantiate. 4 .

[E 2298 405 34 Copy No. Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 27.) (No. 156.) Sir, ^ Tehran, April 1 , 1936. IN my despatch No. 115 of the 5th March, I reported on the steps taken to meet the inconvenience which the wives of British Indian subjects were encountering at Meshed in connexion with the unveiling campaign. I now have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz reporting similar difficulties at Khorramshahr, and a copy of a circular despatch which it has seemed desirable to send to His Majesty’s consular officers in this country. 2. It will be seen from this circular that the revolutionary alteration in the domestic, religious and social ways of the Persian people involved in the abolition of the chaddar has been enforced, and enforced rapidly and drastically, without any law or even any police regulation being passed or laid down. 3. Another aspect of this tacit procedure presented itself when Indian pilgrims to Meshed, on reaching the barren and inhospitable frontier station of Mirjawa and applying for visas there, were informed that no visas would be given for two months, i.e., until Moharram was over. Repeated enquiries here tardily confirmed the Government of India’s belief that the reason for the prohibition was anxiety as to the effect of veiled Indian women in unveiled Meshed during Moharram, but these enquiries have entirely failed to find a regulation or even a Department ready to acknowledge responsibility for the issue of the order. 4. The fanciful picture drawn by the chief of police of the members of his force, in the heyday of a dictatorial regime, spontaneously encouraging old ladies to seize greater freedom might be contemplated with poignant feelings by ex-members of our own police force, who, under a Liberal Administration, were permitted no such generous exuberance towards the suffragettes. There has, of course, been much hardship, and often great severity and cruelty, in the campaign, and also much roughness on the part of the police. It is, however, the case that few, if any, instances of physical brutality have been reported to me from the provinces or in Tehran, whereas there have certainly been occasions when the native wit of the molested lady has turned the laugh against the policeman. 5 . Views will vary as to the wisdom of the campaign and its ulterior consequences, but it already seems clear that the Shah’s victory is assured. At an athletic match last week Mrs. Jordan, who has been for thirty years at the American College here, told me that, in looking at the spectators, she thought she was in America, the interpretation being the numbers of girls, mixed with young men, in European dress. Only from Kermanshah are there reports of any effective passive resistance, and it may well be that it will not seem necessary to report further to you on the physical progress of the unveiling campaign. 6 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. NEVILE BUTLER. Enclosure 1. Consul Watkinson to Mr. Butler. (No. 15.) Sir, Ahwaz, March 3, 1936. ’ WITH reference to the reports in my last few monthly political diaries regarding the introduction of new dress regulations for women, I have the honour to report that a petition has been received by His Majesty’s vice-consul at [690 dd—3]Khorramshahr from the Indians of Abadan, who state that some of their wives wearing the chaddar are not allowed to go to public baths or to take a “ bellam” on the river. . 2. Captain Chauncy proposes to discuss this matter privately with the local Governors, and he does not think that there will be any serious difficulty. 3 . There are, however, over 400 adult British Indian Moslem and Hind' ^ women in this province, where the total number of British Indian subjects an^ protected persons is about 1,300. Many Hindu women wear the chaddar, but it is unlikely that they will be interfered with if they revert to their native costume. 4 . The same problem is being faced by my Iraqi colleague at Khorramshahr, and the position of the Bahreini community may also have to be considered. I shall be grateful if I may be informed as to what action I should take if the restrictions now applied to Iranian women are generally applied and if further complaints are received. It would also help if the exact regulations under which the police and other authorities are now acting could be communicated to me. I have, &amp;c. A. E. WATKINSON. Enclosure 2. Circular Despatch to His Majesty's Consular Officers in Iran. (No. 10.) Sir, Tehran, April 1, 1936. ENQUIRIES having been received from more than one of His Majesty’s consular officers in this country with regard to the position of British Indian women under the present campaign for the unveiling of women, it may be useful for you to know what steps have been taken to ensure for British nationals freedom from molestation. 2 . Early last month His Majesty’s consul here called on the acting chief of police, and expressed the hope that no steps would be taken to interfere with the wives of British Indian subjects who wore saris or other Indian forms of dress. Colonel Mukhtari at once agreed that there should be no interference with foreign women. 3. At the same time, however, His Majesty’s consul warned all Indians who came to him for advice that the police would be likely to harry their womenfolk in ways which it would be impossible to combat, if they wore any garment resembling a chaddar. He therefore advised that they should wear some distinctly Indian form of dress. 4. Subsequent experience with regard to the treatment of Indian women in the provinces, e.g., at Meshed, has shown that representations made by His Majesty’s Legation have had effect. I now learn from the chief of police that general instructions have been sent to the police in the provinces that no pressure is to be brought to bear on foreign women. I therefore trust that no further complaints will be received. 5. Should it appear to you, however, that the above instructions are being disregarded, I should be glad if you would inform me by telegraph, in order that renewed representations may be made to the chief of police. At the same time, I consider that it would be as well for you to repeat to Indians the advice given to them here, that their wives should wear distinctively Indian dress and eschew the typically Persian chaddar. 6 . For your information I would add that no precise law or regulations exist with regard to unveiling. The chief of police has defined the position by saying that no formal instructions have been issued by the Council of Ministers, the police or any other body, the movement being regarded as a spontaneous, national one. No penalty, either imprisonment or fine, will be inflicted on any women who continue to wear a chaddar. The police have, however, joined in the national movement by advising and exhorting women to discard their chaddars and by pointing to the example of their more enlightened sisters. I am, &amp;c.

Legation f April 3rd 19.56. &lt;o Sir, In continuation of my d. apatch Ho.96 (116 /q/3q) of the 22nd February last, I have the honour to inform you that a very long report on the acan ml j connectsa with the Ministry of oads and dommunic tiona ?as published in the local press just before the No ;uz festival; perhaps it may have been responsible for th^ genera gloom shich was very apparent in the s laams hall on that usually joyous occasion, g. m via., of the length of the report I do not propose to trouble you with the fulx tu^t# which appeared piece meal in French in the J urnal de Teheran on the 20th. , 26 th. ,2ctu and 27th of March. I give below a summary of the main points of the report, which was signed by the four members of the special sub-commiaoion of the Minist y of Justice appointed to examine the accusations an j report to the Fajlis. 3 . pn the first place, says the report, the dossiers examined show that the Ministry of Roads and communications, during the tenure of office of All Vanaour, «raa In a very oa-. state; all sorts of irregularities ware going on. an.i the Minister not only reaped consiaarable profit therafrom VUmuelf. but was raai-onsiole, whether na knew what was going on or not, for the faults of his subordinates. A catalogue of the names of the latter then follows, with a gurosMT of *&gt;&gt;• proy * d against them.

Movlavi says that he paid 65,000 rials of his share to goltan Mohammad Ameri. All A &gt;ghar Taleghani, administrative director of the Sentab Company, says that he , aid 150,000 ria^s to Mansour as an inducement to him to sanction contracts for the const ac tion of bridges. He also confesses to having pail 160,000 rials to Amir Asian!, and 40,000 riala to ooltan Mohammad Ameri* Kss&amp;tollah Hedayat confesses to receiving 96,000 rials from the at h company. Amir Asian! received 510,000 rials fror; various -'on. Ho. a. ein All Movlavi received 250,000 rials* Reaa Gholi oapahi and &gt;oltan Mohammad Ameri received further large sums * d* une fa^on illicite t .

Voasough went naif shares with kovlavi in 50,000 riais, and also received 65,000 rials from three Europeans. Hasaan pour a sirdar, of the Mazandoran Road Department, extracted 90,000 rials from contract- rs; Mohammad All ihaibani Wide * i ...rge suffl®’; Moazodi, an Accountant ade about 70,000 rials; Kamrani^ extracted large sums from the treasury of the Ministry, but alleges that he paid 50,000 rials a month for eight months to General Ayrom, head ot the 1 olice; Haacan i amini took large su s from the cent 'actors in Gurgan. 4. Ail Mansour, says the report, was or ought to nave been cognisant of all these irregularities. He also bought a yacht for the Imperial Court from the but h company without ««* ...... putting th matter up to tender at all, ana when the inspection department of his Ministry drew his attention to irregularities he too no notice; in fact he dissolved that department. 5./5 . The report then * rocaede to a very lonjj discussion of the throe main fscousationa aaainat ; an sour. which are uriofly as follows. Firstly, Fansour took 160,000 rials from the uentau Ooapany In connection with the construction of the new briage from Ohazian to . ahlavi. The proof of this reads as though Taleghani were the prosecuting party, Mansour denying always, and the* aub- cotr, mission supporting Taleghani. secondly, Kanaour contracted with the German company Chichav to purchase a dredger for the port of Po jhahr at a price of 21,000,000 risla, without ; roper adjudication or tender, thereby causing the Government a 108.. of 900,000 rials. He also caused the Government a loss of 48,000,000 rials in exchange. It appears that a German company named Lopiker had male an off r, previously to that of Chichav, to supply the oredgor at a much lower price; and that Mansour had not insisted on the successful coir, any'8 employing the sun received in the purchase of Iranian exports. Therefore ranaour -ontributeu largely to the regrettable 'erise dee devises’. At the end of a long argument on those points the loss to the Government on exchange is restated as 4,800,000 rials, showing that a cypher aeoae to a .▼« gone astray during the argument. The third item concerns the contract lor the of the iort of Mo Shaiir; Maneour received, through..tne agency of Mohammad Mabavi, a largo urib- no... tit. company* 30 far, the only direct interest wnich His Majesty's Government have in the mi tter is the ta 4 hnT ior of a aritiah order given the aceused Minister is the holier - hv Kin* to oux* interests during the him for hel* aci or od by him war. But in the same issue of the yre&amp;» appears concerning Issa (or Ksau) Kooros. further report The president of the/the Majlis is reported to hav&lt;s announced that the Public . rosecutor of the *Gour penal® dea fonotionnalrea* had submittal a report accusing a &gt; re/iouf..

Kooroa finally agreed with him for two per cant (' 1 ha exact amount, I un erst an i 9 of his own commission from Imperial Chemical industries) and pai i it to Afshar in two installments The payment was inscribed in the dooxs of Kooros Brothers as a personal drawing in th name of Issa and his broth r Hasten Kooros. This accuBati&lt;in was duly submitted to the examination of the Majlis ’commie ion ie la justice 1 . 7. It docs not therefore appear that the Kooros B rot he re are nocuaed of anything more serious than the transference to fshar of the commission which they themselves were personally entitled to, in order not to lose the order. Nevertheless 1 have heard rumours that the Kooros Brothers intend to leave Iran as soon as they are m a *oeition to io so, and to carry on their buelnesu elsewhere* d. It how remains to be seen what a ntancea will be pronounced upon the accused persons by th© .roper courts* The evidence, as published, looks black, though we have nou yet heard what the defence is. The accused will oi . a-, rse be confronted with the impossible task of roving theme :lvas innocent before a court which has determined already to find them guilty - in fact has probably alreaiy be n instructed what punishment to inflict. The Shah will t m.ike it clear that only one ; erson in this country i allowed aake unlimited profits; and the dutiful .rasa will treat u., to the usual outourata of sanctlnonlous banalities. Xt seems/saema clear that large sums of money have . ean paid by Foreign Coi panics (not British) for cont acte in Iran; the cc mpaniee , erhaps regar ling them aa a part of the price, and the recipients aa a Legitimate or customary commission, useful for keeping pace with a high cost of living on a very small salary- 9. I should perhaps add that not all of the persona who have been in prison for ,ome time on account &lt;:f these scandals appear in th report; a notable exception is Abdullah Naoavi. It remains to be seen whether any action will be taken against the bribing companies; for according to the criminal code the giver, as well -s the receiver, of a bribe is guilty of an offence. 10. As regards Kampsax, the most important foreign concern engaged in the work of improving communications, I learn that Ponsieur Saxil i was received in audience by the Shah shortly before Ho daz an j that Hla Imperial Majesty told him that, while the company enjoyed hie ntire confidence, they must be more careful in future in engaging and controlling their subordinates.

Ho cases of trouble here have been reported to ?ae but on the 24th of February His Majesty’s Consul-G-eneral in Khorassail telegraphed, to me that the discarding of the veil, rigorously enforced, was causing great inconvenience to British Moslem subjects in Meshed.

I have informed Colonel 'Daly and have suggested that as in Tehran so in Meshed a hint should be given that women will be well advised to wear typically Indian dross* The Shch is taking such risks over his unveiling campaign and it is so much the question of the moment that foreigners wj.11 /inevitably Bight Honourable Anthony Eden, M«C*» M*P*, etc* , etc* p etc* , The Foreign Office*inevitably suffer annoyance if they wear the actual Persian chuddar* I have asked Colonel Daly to keep me informed of developments* 2 # I enclose herein a copy of a further despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz on the prosecution of the unveiling capptign in his province.

Sir, Continuing my reports on the unveiling of women in this district, I am able now to reflect a calmer and more resigned atmosphere than that in which I wrote my despatch No.6 of February 3rd. The Shah has had his way once more. The symptoms of general hysteria which might have brought out an angry mob have disappeared and the four- fifths of the population who are not in Government service or King’s men for other reasons have relapsed into their several individualities, each concerned to save himself from official displeasure by a minimum of compliance. 2. It is now possible to review as a whole the methods which have been used to produce this result. Ever since the men were made to adopt European hats it has been understood that sooner or later the Shah would turn his attention to the unveiling of women. It seems certain that the Government has wished to lead rather than drive the people in this direction. Its action, until the end of 1935, was limited to propaganda, in the newspapers, by lectures and so forth, while the schools were unveiled and held as a noble example for adult women; but this policy of what I have called gentle suasion was successful with none except a handful of people anxious to curry official favour. Even the officials remained as a whole unresponsive. Indeed, it seemed that a people accustomed only to being driven, Charge d f Affaires, British Legation, Tehran.driven, interpreted the leniency of this interval as a sign of indecision, and withdrew into a conscious aloofness, glad of an opportunity to refuse the authorities a favour. In my opinion there was more opposition to the plans for unveiling in December than there was in July. 3. The Governor-General went to Tehran in November, returning at the end of December to give effect at once to a more i-mrposeful policy. He caused a large number of reunions to be held in January, at which Government servants and all on whom pressure could be exercised were made to appear and show their wives unveiled; but still the general public refused to follow a lead and remained firm in an attitude of sulky, passive resistance. At this atage the effort to lead was abandoned, and the public was sharply and repeatedly prodded forwards, 4. The first and sharpest shock was given when the Governor General, supported ominously by the ^ir Lashgar, called on the four leading mollahs and summoned them to attend a reception to be given on February 6th, with their wives, This meant that there was to be no quarter for anyone, and surprise, anger and a sense of outrage surged among the people. For a moment, violence was possible, but rumours began to be heard saying that the army would hang any who resisted the Shah’s wishes and then, as was doubtless intended from the outset, the mollahs were given a respite. The moment passed. An officer was publicly arrested m the bazaars because he had taken his wife there still wearing her charshat and it soothed the people somewhat to know that at least everyone was being treated alike. 5 . The next move lay in measures to apply the lesson which had been taught. Doctors were forbidden to admit veiled womenwomen to hospitals; the baths, the cinema, the use of public carriages, the protection of the police were denied to them, and then, on the 9th, patrols of police and soldiers refused them passage on the main khiaban, removing charshabs without pity from those who insisted on using that street. On the 10th and 11th the patrols were extended over a widening area, suggesting that eventually all streets would be watched. On the 12th, however, following the policy of relenting for a space after each forward prod, the authorities suspended all these measures for one week. During that week the bazaars were thronged by thousands of women and the prices of clothing materials have doubled. Yesterday the patrols appeared again in the main khiaban, but scarcely a woman stirred from home, and the few who did had their faces as effectively covered with scarves as they were by the old veils. The women have abandoned the traditional veil under compulsion, but they have not unveiled and it will be interesting to see for how long they will maintain this attitude of passive resistance. The authorities must feel themselves in a quandary. They know that these scarves are worn from a feeling of hostility, but these can scarcely object because a woman wraps herself well in a warm scarf in this cold weather. For the moment they are likely to be content that, in discarding the charshab, the women have obeyed the letter of the law, and Tabriz has doubtless already been officially declared unveiled. 5. The situation in other centres of population in Azerbaijan is understood to be similar. The sparsely populated country districts are probably little aifected because thei women, accustomed to outdoor labour, have never worn the charshab in any case, they count for little more, in the scheme of things Iranian, than the cattle they rear. 6. It appears probable, therefore, that when Ataturk passespasses through Azerbaijan, if indeed he does eventually come to return the Shah’s visit, he will find, as the Shah has planned, the main streets of the various towns lined with women in European clothing, assembled to greet him. 7. What, however, of the back streets? There, and beneath the surface generally, the scene is very different. It is natural that change and disturbance of settled modes should be resented, but this particular change has aroused unusually bitter anger for two main reasons. I do not class among them religious fanatisism; the numbers of the really faithful are few in these days, and their former leaders have been discredited. 'What I think has hurt the richer classes most is that they know themselves to be ludicrous in their Europeanised roles, and ridicule is notoriously hard for an Iranian to bear. The reception of February 6th was a pathetic affair. By common consent the women had covered their faces with scarves and turned up the collars of their coats, looking forth with one eye as of old, but with their charshabs had gone their assurance and dignity. ^most any European woman would have had sympathy and understanding for the panic-stricken, elderly creatures huddling together in groups, but no one present was sure enough of herself for that. Those who had passed the ordeal of arriving, oi being presented, and of finding a seat, tried to find some assurance for themselves hy marking the poor performance of those who came later. They did not all, as some did, kiss in return the hands of the men who, obeying orders, had greeted them in that fashion; but few could have left the hall without feeling that they too had given cause for comment and mirth in some quarter, and judging by accounts few have resisted the temptation to minimise their own shortcomings by exaggerating those of the for many of these old ladies. was a day of bitterness8 . ihe second main cause of anger dears chiefly on the poor. Some women who had gone shopping early on the 9th before the patrols appeared found it impossible to get back to their homes without removing their charshabs. Some were able to borrow coats from men but other in desperation had eventually to uncover the near nakedness of the poor and flee across the street. In a general way one knew that poverty is extreme in I this town, but it was never so tellingly illustrated as when the Shah 1 s men tore charshabs from the poorer of his subjects in the streets of Tabriz. And now people are repeating the story of the group of poor women who went to the municipality a few days ago to ask for the help which, according to the local paper 'Tabriz’* was to be given to those who lacked the means to buy new clothes; they were ejected by the police ana left screaming that they too would have no choice but show their nakedness in the streets. 9. These things surely will not be forgotten readily. It is long since the natural human inclination to wish for a change of government developed here into hatred of the existing one. It probably matters little to the Shah that that hatred snould become more intense. His dictatorship, like the others of this period, has survived much opposition at home and many prophecies of disaster from abroad. Yet people feel that an end must come and according to their bearing in these times they look forward to it with relish or fear. It may, of course, happen quite otherwise than is expected. Interest in this possibility is shown in the rumour, now circulating, that the Shah will presently abdicate in favour of his son in oruer to guide him through the first dangerous years. One leturn always to the crux of the matter, the maintenance of a stro g central power. So long as it continues, whether in the hands of the Shah or his son, people here will acquiesce in the hattinghatting of men, the unveiling of women, the discredit of the mollahs, the monopolies wnich are ruining their trade, indeed in any harshness social or commercial and in time will forget their loyalty to the old order of things, accepting the new just as the men came to accept the Pehlavi hat in spite of i their dislike of it at the outset. At the moment, however, one feels that many wrongs will have heen forgotten before people forgive the Shah for the offence which he has given to nearly all classes by his passion to imitate Ataturk. 10, It is, of course, the popular belief that Ataturk instructed the Shah to have men hatted and women unveiled before he came to Iran and it is thought that he stayed away until now on that account. As the new year approaches prophecies are being made of what it will bring, and one of the popular forecasts is that Ataturk will be assassinated in the course of 1315# He is regarded as the cause of all the troubles of hats and veils, and for the time being he and his country are both unpopular in Azerbaijan.

T FEB ■ 7 r* ■00 Sir, In his despatch Ho. 22 of January 11th, His Majesty’s Minister reported further on the campaign for the abolition of the chadoiar. This is the matter on which the Shah * a heart seems at the moment principally set, and it will be remembered tnat he referred to it in the interview recently accorded to r H. * natchbull- Hugeseen. 2. I now have the honour to enclose an interesting despatch from Bis Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz showing how the campaign is being pursued in one of the provinces. Besides illustrating the paradox that the emancipation of women may lead to the incarceration of their husbands, Mr. Urquhart * s despatch confirms the impression suggested by other evidence that pressure is being applied much more openly and more widely in the provinces than in Tehran. At Hamaaan, for instance, droshky drivers and crossing sweepers have been compelled by the police to paraae their women-falk unveiled. At Shiraz sultan Eakhshani, the .nai8-i-Zalieh and a capable official has been suspended because his wife attended, wearing the caaddar, an official reception given for the Minister of Finance* At Kerman the o-overnor-General is said to be showing tact and patience in the face of general ill-will roused by the campaign, and from Bushire passive resistance is reported to what is regarded as a sacrilegious change.

In Tehran as at Tabriz there are many rumours not easy to sift. It is widely current that it required drastic action on the part of tne Shah to persuade the Queen to take part in the function described in His Majesty’s Minister’s despatch under reference. It is a fact that since then Her Majesty has peri armed similar public duties, similar to those associated with the Queen in our own country. A fortnight ago we were told that before the month was out we should be seeing the public de-chaddaring of women by picked squads of police. There has been no such spectacle and one still sees infinitely more women with the chaddar than without it, though wearers are now forbidden the use of wheeled transport. And in contrast to Mr. Urquhart’s report of serious trouble at Khol the inspired press has since then referred to the progress that unveiling is making there. Taere are ouhev reports that a law is to be passed by the Mejliss setting a date for the abandonment of the chaidar, and that Friday, as in Turkey, is to be changed to dunday as the weekly holiday. 4 # Apart from traditional feelings wounded, the economic hardship sometimes involved, and aeeper misgivings as to the ways Iran is going, there seems no douht that Persian men and women dislike intensely being .aadv- in any way to take the time from Turkey. ^ these scores 6, some ohservers believe that resentment'is fast becoming exasperation, end that, with the aggravation of a public conscience shocked by the Meshed massacre and the /judicial- 3 - * J ''J.vstii Ol Js?1! $ oil#, fO 1110 El li oielEi mi pl IMV ! 3191^ ’ H3 fll P H^|PI |JlO^ &amp; E f Oi) n-* * judicial murder of the Innocent Asadi, there is real danger to the regime* ‘This is outside the compass of this despatch* 6* As far as the ohaddsr issue is concerned, it is probable that the mollahs at any rate are a spent force; and the Shah is leavening the renewed pressure with certain administrative measures designed to alleviate its economic incubus. It may well prove, as Mr* Urquhart from Tabriz seems to forecast, that resignation will again prevail, and that the Shah will successfully bring a younger generation up and drive the older one along this other Western path to which his own instincts and the example of Mr* Ataturk impel him.

'..A« ^ Sir, ¥ith reference to ray despatch No. 62 of the 7th February, I have the honour to inform you that the movement to force Iranian women to unveil is still continuing vigorously. No really drastic measures have yet been taken by the authorities but officials and all persons upon whom pressure can easily be brought are being mad to unveil their wives and take Uiem to 4-lae* mixed parties compulsorily organised to enable their participants to express their spontaneous joy at this new reform. Recently one such party was given by the Mayor of Gxilhek for the leading inhabitants of the village but I understand that it was a complete failure, as there was much undisguised weeping and the men and women kept strictly apart, the latter hiding their faces as much as possible with their hands or the lapels of their coats. As a result it is believed that another party is to be organised. Incidentally I hear that the wife of Monsieur Hikmat, Minister of .uucat ion, who is the sister of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs has gone to Xerbela on pilgrimage and that there is consternation in the Hlkmat family, because when she reaches Iraq she will have to put on a choddar in accordance with the universal habit of Iranian women there; and they are all /afraid The Right Honourable Anthony Kden, L.C*, M•••» etc. , etc., etc., The Foreign Office.- 2 - afraid that this shocking fact will percolate to the Imperial ear. 1 2, At the moment the great majority of women in Tehran are still veiled but persons in close touch with the bazaar state that the number of unveiled women to be XUxAt seen ^is remarkable ana that the movement is catching on. If anything, its momentum is now likely to increase as the -ehran shopketp^rs are reported to have decided recently to refuse to serve women who enter their shops veiled. Surpz*isingly^women are still allowed to enter certain at any rate of the Government offlees, e.g. the Post Office; but it is not unlikely that they will soon 4A. be excluded and rumours are current that they will shortly be prevented from walking along the main streets of the town, 3, In view of all these developments His Majesty’s Consul recently called on the Acting Chief of Police and expressed the hope that no steps would be taken to interfere with the wives of British Indian subjects who wear saris or other Indian forms of dress. Colonel ;fukhtari I am glad to eay ; at once agreed that their should be no inter ference with foreign women, though it would be rash to assume from this that no difficulties will in fact arise. Leading Kurramis in particular have recently expressed great concern at present developments and Mr. Summerhayes has warned them that it is likely that the police will harry them in ways that the Legation cannot combat if their wives wear any garment resembling a chaddar* &amp; number them now state that they will prefer to leave Iran, though the -’Fathers” of the colony have decided that it would be politic for them to observe the Iranian regulations. 4, I have not heard much news lately from the /provincesprovinces, though a European who has only just returned from a visit to Isfahan, Shiras, Bushire, Khorramshahr, Ahwas and Sultanahad and Qum told a memher of ray staff that, with few exceptions in the digger towns, all the women he saw were still wearing chaddars. I have, however, received a further, most interesting despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Tabriz, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy herein. Mr. Urquhart has since telegraphed that in consequence of the strength of public feeling the leading Ulema have been excused for the present from unveiling their womenfolk. He adds that the majority of the^guests brought their wives to the party of which he makes mention in the first paragraph of his despatch, but that the spirit of passive resistance was strong, practically all the women covering their faces with scarves oS* the lapels of their coats. I would invite particular attention to the fourth paragraph of Mr. Urquhart 1 s des patch, in which he expresses the fear that, should any explosion of fanaticism occur, it might lead to dangerous manifestations of xenophobia. I would also add that I endorse the assumption in the sixth paragraph of his despatch. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India Ho. 40.

Later the police were found to be ordering veiled ladies to leave the main streets and forbidding them to sit in cafes or attend cinemas* a. January Qth was, in the words of the 'journal de leheran' an historic day. The Shah drove to open the new Scale Horn ale ’rlmaire, accompanied by the iueen aw -rlriees;* She Eoyal ladies were unveiled for the first time. The route was sparsely lined with police and it was to he noticed, that any veiled woman who made art appearance was promptly hustled behind a door or into a side street.

Those who hold by the oj-d usages will have to shift for themselves. One nears frequently of ladies of the older generation who ^eel that they can never again leave their houses. . It is early to forecast whether opposition will maka 6«* *!!&gt;•* ' ut since tiie Beene® at Meshed it there will be further trouble* r i?here is little doubt that, after i'eehed, the pace was deliberate! slowed down but one of the causes of the fall of the late Prim* Minister, Monsieur Feronghl, is thou^it to have been his opposition to the rapidity with which the shah proposed to press on the unveiling, fhera will certainly be underground hostility on the ^part of the elder generation and the strongly religious element, but an even more cogent cause for complaint will be the economic effect. To compel an already gravely impoverished people to buy themselves new trousseaux, however modest, and that in mid •winter, would appear to be an act which would scarcely be reconciled with the end of the 'moral and material torture 'of womankind in Iran. it does not however appear that actual compulsion is intended beyond that which can b® exercised by the engineering of public opinion. The Shah seems to realise that any general order to unveil would be a serious mistake. V. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India {Jo. 8).

Mr. Mallet# has written a very readable account of his tour. The account of his interview with the'Governor-General of Khorassan (pages 4—6) is most entertaining, and he has made many interesting ooservations on economic development of the country. The labour conditions in the factories at Meshed are deplorable, and the condition of the peasants, both in Khorassan and Gurgan, appears to be pretty desperate. The attempt to Westernize these districts seems to be progressing slowly and painfully, and there is a good deal of latent opposition amongst the people. The Trans-Persian Railway is progressing fast and the stretch between Bander Shah and Tehran will he completed next yeai. It seems doubtful, however, whether the Persians will be capable of keeping the Railway in runningHI i i running order without foreign assistance. Mr. Malletl draws a much more hopeful picture of conditions in the South: the districts around Is^han are prosperous and the administration is enlightened, with beneficial effect both to the people and to visitors. - tu Lf f iCAL COMMITTEE.

Several halts for sightseeing, luncheon, etcetera. Manoeuvres on between barjerud and Jaboun; apparently a defensive line in front of xua-i-Hind being attacked by a force advancing from Firuzkuh. Anti-aircraft guns conspicuous from the road; six armoured ears near daboun; a good deal of motor transport on the road and a large ambulance post at daboun. Shah expected, but 1 believe did not turn up that day. Slept at the inn at Shahrud, outwardly clean but actually verminous. September 29th: Shahrud to Hashed. Left 7 a.m., arrived Meshed 7.30 p.m., but we delayed over an hour trying to shoot gazelle near sabsevar and half an hour at Mishapur to see Omar Khayyam * s tomb which has been furbished up with American money; the garden is now lovely and the laemz.adeh ver$ tidy but the old tombstone of Omar Khayyam has disappeared and a monstrous phallic obelisk erected instead; no rose petals on the tomb.’ Distance, Sh&amp;hrud - Meshed: 520 kilometres. Load good except between sab sever and iishapui where t-h r ■ are some very bad bumps and corrugation. ih£ lx**i bit Meshed is very twisty over the small range of hills; a new road is to be ready next month which will run over level ground and probably save half an hour between Mlshapmr Meshed. The Governor-General of Khorasan also told me taat the road from Tehran direct to semnan via ^ishlak ( will be ready next year which will then mean an almost flat /runrun fro a Tehran to i'eshed# September 50th - October 3rd; At Meshed. October 3rd* Meshed to T&amp;lkh, a Berber! village about fifteen miles beyond Fariman, where the Shah has recently acquired a vast estate worth fifteen thousand Tomans a year at a price said to be one hundred thousand Tomans, but actually believed to b# about thirty thousand. toad excellent to FarIman # but we left the main road afterward! and went across country up a river bed to get to Talkh about ten miles off the road. October 3rd ~ 6th: At Talkh shooting. We had an escort of Aranieh as the Governor-General said that aistrict was unsafe. It seems to have been true, though probably not of the road in daylight; apparently there is a brigand called Ghulam Hussein who litres at times in the wooded hills behind Talkh and blackmails the villagers; if they don’t give him what he asks for, he swoops down on their village and takes sheep, horses, etcetera. He has infested the district for two years on and off; a few months ago he fled to Afghanistan and was imprisoned at Herat, but escaped with the connivance, so says the Governor-General, of the Afghan authorities and four months ago returned to maraud in his old haunts. He was recently responsible for a hold-up and robbery of three cars on the Meshed-Sahedan road (this I heard from the peasants and not from the Governor-General). The Amnieh say he is terrified of them but the villagers say quite the reverse and suggest that the Amniah are a tempting live-bait. October 6th: Talk - Meshed. Three hours. October 7th: Meshed - Shahrud. We stopped at the little Mosque of ladam or Kaciamgah before reaching HIshapur. Is is a very lovely small safavid building and they showed us /iw immense footprints of the Imam keza on black marble. The Mullahs in charge are of astonishing rapacity# /Oct ob erOctober 8thj Bhahrud - firuzkuh* Five hours.

Pul-i-Sefid to sari; About two hours over a bad bit of much cut up by heavy traffic and suffering from landslides but in process of repair. Sari - Ashraf; where there is the interesting old ruin of Shah Abbas’ palace magnificently placed on a terrace like a great Italian villa with huge cypresses beside it. Koad excellent. Thence to Bander (}ez, about one hour. Hoad quite good till within four miles of Bander Gez when it becomes difficult, but is being built and will soon be perfect - presumably before the Shah goes to the Turcoman races# By next year I understand that the road will be built through to Bander Shah. At present it is essential to put a car on the train fro® Bander Gez to Bander shah - price thirty four Rials. At Bander Oez there is said to be a passable hotel, but at Bander Shah we were saved by some kind Swedish engineers who put the station waiting room at our disposal and there we pitched our camp beds. October 10th: Bander Shah to Asterabad, or Ourgan as it is now called «• three quarters of an hour over a fine road. Gurgan to pahlavidish and Gumbad-i-Kabus - two and a half hours. Mot a made road but a good desert track with a big new bridge at pahlavi&amp;Ash and on© under construction at Gumbad. The great tomb tower -at Guabad (A.b. 1006) is a most remarkbale momument but it is full of chained up Turcoman prisoners and we were not allowed in. Thence we went half an hour to the edge of the steppe and the wooded hills at Basilar, where we camped at a spring under a bx,^ chenar for shooting.

Hoads all excellent* they are still rebuilding all the bridges and making concrete ones to replace the rickety wooden ones. October 15ths heft Chains 9.45 a.m. Arrived Tehran 4.15 p.m. Road better than I have previously known it, but still a lot of workmen busy on it. The road from Gurgan direct to Shahrud is being pushed on and will be ready in ten months time, so the Governor of Gurgan told me. CQMBIT10NS XM K.HQK ASM * The Governor-General, Pathullah rakrevan, is by training a diplomat, who ha® been Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Ambassador in Moscow. He was Minister in Sgypt throughout the w&amp;r and boasted of his aecjuaintanoK with successive High Commissioners, of who* he seemed to prefer Lord Allenby. A nervous man with a jerky manner and twitching face who doesn't inspire confidence but was certainly very friendly and helpful to us personally. From all accounts he is unpopular both with Persians ara European®, who compare him unfavourably with Jam and Bahram/o engagement. My own i mingle with European®; Iranians who have foreign wives are /often— 5 often like this - no doubt they are already somewhat suspected and nave to be extra circumspect• jpakrevan talked gloomily of his job - not a bed of roses. As soon as he had got to Me sued there nad been the Afghan border incident which kept hi® busy for months f and tnen came the trouble in the shrine. He said he hadn*t had time to tour much in his vast district ~ larger than the whole of Italy; the Afghans were odious neighbours and no words could describe their iniquities; their tribesmen were kinsmen of the Persians across the border and there was perpetual intrigue and smuggling. Mr. Heilly and I had two long interviews with His Excellency, and though much of our talk was of our plans and the beauty spots of Meshed he led u© into high politics once or twice - the evolution of Hussia (where we were given to understand he was on the most intimate terms with sir K* Grey and Lord Ghilston) and the sudden revulsion there against divorce; Ethiopia and Italy (where His kxceilency knew Mussolini intimately * tt c , est &amp; dire je lui ai plus!cure fois pEurle’*} in whose dispute His Excellency seemed to be firmly anti-Italian and inclinedto think auBBOlini rather aad. A few rattier dangerous ooamonplaees were tticn eACtianged atiout ttie evils of dictatorships* but perhaps w# both realised that the tail might easily drift into l&amp;se-Majeetl so the subject changed to less weighty t Op 1Q S . A large pactiet of official dossiers were laid on His ixeelleney'« desit by a cleric and X ventured to hop that among his heavy labours there were not too .'.any bothers from His Majesty's Consulate-General. He assured «« there were not. I said I hoped that more and more of the small local complaints would be settleu direct /rather6 ff%) rather than forwarded to Tehran, and he rather indignantly answered 'I’m always ready to settle what I can hut it’s Daly who keeps referring tilings to Tehran*. (Colonel Daly told me afterwards that actually they didn't have too much bother in Khorasan. Sahedan is the trouble, and that is now in Mekran). I said I felt sure that if he and Daly discussed these questions amlaably they would easily be solved, for after all Daly was the most charming and reasonable man* pakrevan admitted this and volunteered that he had little or no troubles with any of the Consulates - they were all most correct - even the Russian - save only the beastly unspeakable Afghan, and here again we were treated to a disquisition on the wickedness of the Eastern neighbour. pakrevan seemed alive to the nuisance caused by the insecurity on the roads, and I felt he was a good deal ashamed of it, though he excused himself by saying that it was all the fault of “toe Afghans and that it was difficult to guard so long a frontier with so few troops. He was most insistent on our having an escort to Talkh, though I believe it was quite unnecessary, Co^JuVv^S \v\ Wk0f(tQ&lt;MA &lt;j Much to everybody's surprise we were allowed to visit the innermost sanctuary of the shrine of Imam Keza, the first non^Moslems, I believe, who have been taken round as it were officially, though many people have been in In disguise with the connivance of the authorities. ie had none the less to pretend to be Turkish pilgrims and Mrs. James was disguised in a chuddar, our impression was tn&amp;t there still exists a very strong fanaticism at Meshed and &lt;&amp; that our visit was rather in the nature of an experiment by the Governor-General and the Mute wall!

Bashl, or Shrine-keeper, Assadi, is a former henchman of a aukat-ul-Mulk, rather a decent- looking tall man in smart European clothes, we did not meet him in toe shrine* but he was evidently curious to see us and adopted the expedient of coming to the Hospital when he knew we would be there. this hospital built out of shrine funds* is going to cost the shrine a great deal to keep going, the $ buildings are rather good and the garden is vast and ablaze with flowers. W« saw several of the poorer patients* some of whom have come in from the remote villages, there are two German doctors at the head, keen and busy, but hampered by the time it takes to get medical store© and the difficulty of getting adequately trained nurses. We heard the usual complaint that whenever the Persians have had about a proper quarter of their*training they think themselves completely qualified. About one hundred and fifty beds are already in use, but that is less than half what is intended. There is an orphanage section in which the Shah is said to be especially interested. The worst problem to be faced is infantile mortality, and the women are very difficult to manage as their religious scruples make them very ihy of examination by male doctors. There is a great, deal of consumption and venereal disease also to be combatted* The hospital is a big effort and will have* 1 believe* a real effect a® an example all over Persia} unhappily there is no other town where the religious revenues are big enough to be turned to such use, and what will happen here if the official discouragement of religion goes much further/ Already the shrine revenues are not enough for its upkeep and they are having to turn to fresh forma of municipal taxation in order to add to the hospital’s revenues.] ® ow /thein# poorer cl&amp;esea caa f t face rraeh further taxation - that was one of the reasons for the rioting in the shrine. wagea are snoefcingly low. We visited the higgeat carpet factory where they are making immense and wonderfully closely-woven carpets for the jhah and Majlis; Most of the work is done by small boys who &amp;M looked about 12 - 16; they earn about two rials a day If they are very expert ana tie at least twelve thous&amp;na knots, but they are paid by piece work and have to work ten hours a aay and also at night shifts. Many of the less expert do not earn much more than a rial a day. the poverty in the villages is no worse than in other parts, but is fairly evident. that the peasants resent more, however, is the deprivation of not having a gun wherewith they can supplement their diet and keep the wolves away from their flocks, the heaaman of Talkh complained to me quite openly that the Government was always interfering - H first they take away our rifles and now our hats*. I thought the poverty in the Turkoman tents on tue Gurgan steppes much worse - there we saw an old man gnawing a dry bone like a aog. fe had hoped to travel direct from Meshed to Asterabad via Bujnurd, the road followed last year by Mr* Trott. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs here had not been encouraging and had murmured about bad weather and Tui-koiaan raider.. I was inclined to disbelieve that the road was impassable owing to weather and that it was merely a case of the usual susftoion of travellers in a military area. This suspicion was reinforeed by a talk 1 nau with General .usaaullah .klrs* Jehanbani. wno laughed at that the ministry for Foreign Aflairs would evei tiaxe approach the Ministry of Vur about it, because it involved getting the bhah’s peraonai fiat for the journey.

This is probably wise as the Colonel has only been at this post eight months. Business was despatched rapidly and decisions taken firmly after a few careful words with either the seyyid or one of the clerks, who trotted about in front of his desk very deferentially. Mm has a very quiet and at first sight rather off-hand manner, but a charming smile and a gentle voice; talks practically no French. He asked ua what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go, and proceeded at one© to facilitate our journey instead of the usual obstruction and suspicion. W© were also lucky to meet at Hajilar an officer who had formerly been an estate agf-nt oi .Rustaufi— el-Mamllk and who again went full out to help us. &gt; came to the conclusion that the military district was being run efficiently and with a good deal less red tap© than the Civil Governorates in other parts. Ihe officer at ua^ilur, a Captain, is in charge of one hundred villages belonging to th« Shah, u district about fifty miles long; he is introducing new crops such as cotton and kun^id ($©s&amp;ma) f building roodsIn a rough and ready way, starting schools, planting village greens; all thif? with a fore© of only twelve men under hi?a, which shows that the neighbouring Turkoman® are pretty harmless nowadays* The Turkomans themselves in the C'urgan steppes are being put into villages, though they may be allowed to keep their tents (kibitkas) for taking the flocks to graze in remoter parts* The villages have the classic Bagh-l^Milli full of petunias, a kind of Government house of two stories and rows of hideous little mud houses, hot and hardly more spacious than a kibitka though better ventilated. Very few' of them are yet inhabited* people looked incredibly poor and ragged, but we were told that there are a few very rich men; one owned sixty thousand sheep; another owned nine hundred brood mares ~ at least he owned up to taat for taxation purposes, which means that he really probably has three times as many* An attempt is being made to get the Turkomans to till the soil and we saw a good many crops round pahlavidish. TOURIST Oi la view of the amount of talk in Tehran about encouraging tourists to visit Iran, it is worth recording that the tiresomeness about jawazes is Just as bad as it was two years ago, and I would never advise any tourist to v bear-led* Between /anything,anything, for we were constantly molested about this, not politely a&gt;$*ed if we had permits (I had two, one from Police Headquarters and one from Ministry of Education) but a fat hand would be banged in front of one’s camera and the well- Known word 'VKadagan* barked out* the famous permits probably work if the photographer has patience but the police can’t read them and insist on one going to the police station (at Omar’s tomb this would have meant a five mile motor drive) in order to get the permits visaed by the Chief of Police* The fact of having a diplomatic ^©waz might ordinarily be expected to make one immune from such annoyances, but in Iran the diplomatic corps have no advantages* The much advertised Shah’s hotel at Chalus has capital bathrooms, etcetera, but all the little amenities are lacking, e*g*, bedside lamps and switches, toilet paper, cold drinks - for there is no ice and no frigidaire; the food is eatable but no more, we were speechless with astonishment at the ugliness of the curtains and chairs. I hear that a Swiss has now been engaged to manage these hotels, so they may impxove. HATS: The new hats, often of remarkable shape and material and seldom elegant or even picturesque, are being sported by nearly everybody in Kharasan, though outside Meshed Itself one sees a good many people wearing a white handkerchief round the head, in turban form* In Meshed the cloth peaked cap is largely favoured but many people have taken the stiffening out of their pahlavis to produce this effect* In Gurgan and among the Turkomans one hardly ever sees an old-fashioned hat or busby; brimmed hats seem /favouritesfavourites and sometimes a straw 'boater* 1 sits oddly above Mongolian features. Strangely enough, it is near Tehran that one sees the most 'Paulavis' and on the Chains road there are hundreds of the old-fashioned pre-pahlavi jellybag hats. I noted no progress in the unveiling of women in towns; the tribal women are anyhow always without veils, though inclined to toy shyly with a piece of stuff round their faees if confronted with strangers.

The majority of the villages I passed through seemed fairly prosperous with some exceptions. Of these, one was Zalu Ah a village of some twelve families situated in a valley directly to the north of the Kuh-i-Parrau. Here the “ houses used in cold weather were nothing more than rough caves hollowed out of the hillside. It was impossible to obtain either an egg or a chicken here. Bisitun, too, seems to be slowly dying. Though from the motor-road the area of houses seems quite large, at least half of those are empty as is the big caravanserai there. This, which, for its upkeep, was endowed with the revenue from three villages nearby, is no longer used at all, and the upkeep money goes instead into the pocket of the mutawalli, a member of the Zanganeh family.

[E 4628/608/34] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hj)are.—(Received July 29.) (No. 304.) Sir, Tehran, July 12, 1935. IN my despatch No. 255 of the 14th June I had the honour to report the abolition of the Pahlavi hat. Further developments are rapidly taking place. 2. It is now apparently assumed that a sufficient supply of “ international hats are available, and, in consequence, the police are taking steps to enforce the new rule that Pahlavi hats must no longer be worn. Their methods of enforce ment vary from a polite reminder to assault and battery upon the unfortunate wearer of what is now an old-fashioned and degrading head-dress. There has evidently been a considerable undercurrent of criticism, which has given rise to rumours of rioting in Tabriz and other centres. I understand, however, that all that has happened has been half-hearted attempts, rapidly suppressed, to close the bazaar. A few shops in the Tehran bazaar closed out of protest, and were promptly reopened by the police. 3. A prominent divine from Meshed is rumoured to have arrived at Tehran with the object of remonstrating with the Shah on the subject of hats, but he has had to take refuge at Shah Abdul Azim, where he is closely guarded in order that the populace may not resort to him. 4. In order to popularise the new hats, meetings of merchants have been promoted, and a great deal of space in the newspapers is occupied with descriptions of the joy with which this move towards emancipation has been received. So many queries have apparently been received from the provinces regarding how hats were to be worn and salutations exchanged, that a lengthy circular has been issued by the Ministry of the Interior to all Governors on the subject. The circular even goes beyond hats, and enjoins cleanliness and shaving, as well as the eschewal of eccentric and brilliantly-coloured garments and the wearing of black bow ties in the daytime. 5. More serious, however, is the strongly supported rumour that all women under 40 will shortly be ordered to discard their veils. There is certainly a strong movement in favour of this, prompted presumably by the Shah, although it i s known whothor t.ho Queen has vet appeared in public in European clothes, theTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERRMENT PERSIA. f 'p y a tT O C' • y July 1, 1935.

ARTICLES of clothing have in recent years become more and more typical of political movements. In Europe the shirt is an essential item in many modern creeds. In Asia the hat has played a no less conspicuous part. The birth pangs of the regenerate Turkey will for ever be associated with the bowler hat. In Persia renaissance has equally had its hat, if not its head, and for better or for worse the Pahlavi hat has sheltered the awakening consciousness of those who more often than not forget to call themselves Iranians. But the Pahlavi hat has rested uneasily on its wearers’ heads. Neither becoming nor practical, it has never been popular. To devout Mahometans its protruding peak is a positive menace at prayer time, while on less solemn occasions its impeccable uniformity must have been the cause of acute distraction in gentlemen’s cloak-rooms. I have once or twice made nervous enquiries as to its permanence, and have usually been informed that it is a t£ hat of transition.” This definition has now been justified. Like so many of the world’s glories, the Pahlavi hat has passed away. The good news became known to the general public on the day of the opening of the Majlis, the 6th June last. But, if the story which reached my ears is true, certain of the inner circle seem to have been privileged with advance information. An official or junior member of the Government who was present when the decision was taken is said to have stolen from the room and made his way to the largest of the very few local emporia, wdiere, in an unconcerned manner, he contrived to purchase almost the entire stock of European hats for 500 tomans. Shortly after the con clusion of this surprising transaction the manager was intrigued at receiving a similar bid from a second official who strolled into the premises. The story ends with the manager’s realisation of the situation and his repurchase of the hats from his first customer at double the price. Even so, I understand that demand has far exceeded supply and that the run on felt hats in the Lalezar can be compared to the gold rush of years ago. 2. But a benign ruler has not thought only of the outer covering : he is equally concerned for the intellect within. The impurities of the Iranian language have for some time caused grave concern. There'is a regrettable plethora of Arabic words (a sentiment which, for practical reasons, I fully share), there are modern tendencies and expressions which distort the ancient beauty of the language. Doubt has even been expressed as to the desirability of retaining the present Persian lettering. On the 20th May the Council of Ministers sanctioned the establishment of an academy for the Iranian language ( ££ Earhangestan-i- Iran ”), which is to be charged not only with the duties of the protection of the language on the lines of the Academic franqaise but is to stimulate scholarship and literary talent. In addition to purifying the language from foreign words and producing a grammar and dictionary, this institution is to guide thought towards the reality of literature and the nature of poetry and prose and to ££ encourage poets and writers towards the creation of literary masterpieces, I am sending a translation of the statute under separate cover in my despatch No. 253 of the 12th June, in case it may interest the School of Oriental Studies. 3. If the uniformitv of the Pahlavi hat has disappeared, this is not to be taken as implying complete freedom in all other respects. On the 12th June the Shah asked me if I had been present at the opening of the Majlis. When I replied m the affirmative, His Majesty expressed pleasure and remarked that if I had been there some years ago I should have noticed a great difference. Then a attired in various garbs, there was no cohesion, no corporate feeling. On e bth June last the members were all dressed alike there was uniformity and discipline; that was what a Parliament should be. Of course, m England it was [465 a—9^different, but what was the use in many countries of a body of men who talked only for the sake of talking and with no knowledge of the subject, and he turned to General Hay and said “ Soldiers are much better : they are simple people and know what they have to do.'’ I reflected that on a previous occasion when I attended a debate in the Majlis 1 had been vividly impressed with the appropriate ness of a line from an Ancient and Modern hymn : “ We are not divided, all one body we.” ^ ^ ^ 4.

His successor as president is Mirza Hassan Khan Esfandiari, Haji Mohtesham- es-Saltaneh, the subject of personality report No. 15 of this year. The Afghan Ambassadoi is convinced that Dadgar never managed to leave the country and is now in Kasr-i-Qajar, though his son was allowed to go into exile. 2. Of the two journalist Deputies Mirza Ali Khan Dashti and Mirza Zain-al-Abidin Khan Rahnema, whose arrest was reported, the former is understood to be ill in hospital and the latter to have been sent out of the country to Iraq, his birthplace. Dashti’s paper, the Shafagh-i-Surkh, is still suppressed, but a concession for the Iran, Rahnema’s old paper, has now been given to Mirza Majid Khan Movagher, who already controls two small local papers. 3. Movagher, the son of a former Deputy for Khuzistan, has not been prominent so far, and after this recent lesson his and other papers are less likely than ever to venture on any criticism of the management of this country. In the Majlis too there has been no sign of sympathy with the disgraced Deputies. 4. It has been suggested that the release of fthe two journalists may have been thought politic in view of the recent visit of a special correspondent of the Italian paper Stampa, of whom some fuss was made here.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on June 23rd. and 24th. last, in company th the Military Attach^, ,.m jor Py bus, i carried out a tour through the puaht-i-Kuh district, going along the road from Shahabad (formerly Harunabad) to Eilam (formerly Deh Bala, also known as Huseeinabad or Husseinieh} and thence to the Iraq frontier at aneurabad along the recently opened road from hi lam to that place. is. a detailed report on the road from Shahabai to Eilam was submitted by Mr. Consul Suamerhayes in his despatch No. 64 of December feist., 1934. For the new road from Hilan to Dansurabad I append a route report for the details of which I am indebted to the kindness of i ajor pybus. 3. A&amp; regards the section from bhahabad to hi lam the only important changes since Mr. Sunuaerhayes journey would appear to be the completion of two villages of stone houses for the tribes, one alongside the road in the middle of the Ouawur plain about 23 miles from Shahabad and one near the point where the road Mb jesty’ s Minister, British Legation, Tehran.ansurabai for travellers we were obliged to accept hie hospitality for our night's lodging. Up till a year or two ago ..laasurabad was apparently a ;uere collection of raud huts hardly worthy of a name- at all. Then rough quarters were erected for the Frontier Commissar and the detachment of road guards. No* a brick built governorate ie being put up as well as a quarantine station, and, though traffic across the frontier seems small, a customs post. The main post in the district is at present at Saleh Safid a few miles North Last of * an aura bad but will be transferred to the latter place in due course. Supplies are scanty, many commodities having to be obtained from Kermanshah, while the water, though plentiful, is bitter and drinking water has to be brought from an underground channel seven miles away. 7 „ I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on June 25th. last, in comps ly with the Military Attach^, Major Pybus, I carried out a tour along the road from Kermanshah to Hausud. x append a route report on the road for the details of which I am indebted to the kindness of Major Pybus. 5, Completed about two years ago, this road was constructed largely to facilitate the control of the turbulent Kurdish tribes who live in these parts and who even today are by no means entirely broken. There is thus little traffic on the road except of a military nature, though tnere is a somewhat nebulous plan on foot to connecu up with a road from Buleimanieh, to be built by the Iraq, authorities. 4 # At present the area west of the Palangan Pats is still under military administration although it is understood that the civil power, in the shape of road guards and police is gradually replacing the military. prom the summit of the Palangan rass almost to Kausud there is a chain of blocKhouses of stone placed on each of the six or seven larger summits s Minister, Legation, Tehran.submits be twee a thebe tYro points. Except for the first post on the summit of the palaagan Pass, which was manned by soldiers, they ax'*© held by detachments of six or eight road guards. Between the palangan Pass and Qiahlaq, which is a well wooded stretch and therefore difficult to control, there were, in addition smaller stone towers about three quarters of a mile apart containing four or six regular soldiers and between these sentries in pairs every few hundred yards. All wheeled traffic must stop at the post on the summit of the palangan pass and notification be sent to Qishlaq by telephone before it can proceed. Traffic is stopped for the night two hours before sunset. The delay Imposed upon us here by the time taken by the military to decide whether to let us through or not was responsible for our being unable to cover the entire road as far as Maueud. The headquarters of this district are at Qishlaq where there are two companies of infantry apparently belonging to the &amp;2nd. regiment. 6. At Paweh there are also troops probably in similar numbers and also the road guard headquarters. It seems, too, thet irregular troops are used by the Iranian authorities in this neigh bourhood inasmuch as one individual was seen in Paw eh clad in Kurdish clothes and wearing several bandoliers full of tailitary ammunition which he would not have been able to do except with the approval of the authorities. 7. To Nausud itself we were unable to penetrate for the reason given above and bo little'■N It little information can be given about it. a Frontier Commieear is stationed there and, doubtless, troops as well. 8.

The disturbances broke out on the night of 11th July in the vicinity of the Meshed shrine ostensibly because of a recent order to wear European hats, but according to the Consul- General’s report the real reason for the outbreak is popular discontent at the ’’long-continued oppression of the lower classes and the universal condemnation of the existing regime.” (The phrase ’’ universal condemnation ” goes perhaps rather too far) . There a,re rumours of a similnr outbreak at Tabriz.

Internal Situation. Memorandum by Mr. Mallet, Counsellor to His Majesty^ Legation at Tehran. Copy of to | SEEM fw. CGMMrrrife. hi vinous payers FOR INFORMATION. A preyious review of the Persian situation written by Mr. Mallet 18 months ago will be found at P.Z. 5225/33. Mr. Mallet has just spent nearly two years at Tehran and he has also the advantage of having been there before in 1919-21. The impression gained by^the present memorandum is that Persia is now even more completely under the control of the Shah than it was two years ago. The recent punishment of the Bakhtiari Khans seems to he an indication of the Shah's confidence in his power. On the other hand, whether the present rdgime and the Sharis wiH survive his death is still a matter of considerable uncertainty tnouji we have/ \ : 1 - 2730 1000 4.34have heard less recently of his alleged ill-health or premature old age and such rumours should probably be discounted. The Shah is not a popular ruler but there is no doubt that the Persians are proud of what he has done for their country. A good deal of material progress has recently been made in the development of communications and industry and in municipal improvements at Tehran and elsewhere. On the other hand irrigation is neglected in spite of the fact that agriculture is the occupation of the bulk of the population; the burden of taxation is very heavy and it is doubtful whether the poor have ever been v/orse off than they are today. Foreign trade has declined and in spite of an apparently strong monetary position it is suggested that Persia may be heading for a financial crisis in the near future. In this connection it may be mentioned that almost a half of the national budget is being spent on the army and navy.

CONFIDENTIAL. January 28, 1935. Section 1. [E 608/608/34] No. 1. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 28.) (No. 5.) Sir, Tehran, January 9, 1935. I HAVE the honour to forward to you an interesting memorandum by Mr. Mallet, counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation, recording his impressions on the internal position in this country after nearly two years’ residence here. Mr. Mallet has the advantage of being able to compare the present position with that which he knew during his previous term of office here from 1919 to 1921. 2. My experience of Persia is too short to enable me to offer any comments on Mr. Mallet’s observations. I can only say that such impressions as I have formed entirely harmonise with his. I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Internal Affairs of Persia. BEFORE going on leave I find myself reflecting on the progress made by Persia in the twenty-one months since my arrival. I am confining my remarks to internal affairs, and not attempting comment on the Shah s recent conduct o foreign affairs. . The Shah is probably no more popular than two years ago, but he is moie feared and respected. Oriental despots are never loved, and do not expec o be. As an oriental despot the Shah is probably above the average m benevo ence to the people at large, and the news of his Turkish tour, well advertise a ove ^ Persia, has, I think, enhanced his prestige with his people. Ihey are aware o his land and money-grabbing propensity, but that is not a new c arac e y ls among Persian noblemen; they are painfully aware of heavy taxa 10 jL probably less interested in the safety on the highways, which is one o e &amp; * which most strikes an European. But the Persians are, I be ieve, pi ou Reza has done for them, and feel that he has raised the respec or abroad now that they see the formerly privileged foreigners trea e e The creation of a Persian navy is one of his most admired ac s, proud of it quite beyond its actual importance, because i , t p ere Shah’s assertion of rights in the Persian Gulf. Among PP -&gt; criticise is a feeling of pride, which in most cases turns easily o nm ’ r ^ w p| the Shah a good deal sotto voce a “ 0 ? e g enough he will become a kind ung his praises and their own. If he lives long eiiougn Nohodv can af legendary figure in his own lifetime, and he may die P P a ' i a k or { ou J Hfe, criticise him for personal ostentation or extravagance, e characterised free from any of the lighter distractions or grosser vices which charactensea the Qajars; he never hardly shows himself m pub !C e p ^ rapidly and no time for hunting or riding; he travels from , issues his orders unexpectedly to the terror of less competent proymc Turkoman races Yet md £ gone 7 His one amusement is ^ does not m spite of this Spartan habit of life he is &lt; while, with the richer demean himself to conversations with his P 0 ^® •! m i na tory and didactic nnes, interviews are apt to consist of monoffig^ and I f an cy nature. Such are his weekly parades of th ^; V ^3 S 0 ^ similar lines. The Shah that those of the Council of Ministers are „ ^ ay i n p. a t p a rty politics, bas forced Persians to work instead^ playmg a at P ar ^^ stil i [ntngumg and quarrelling as their h ^ spr ing of 1933 people were fresh impel them to do but for fear t and were wondering how the Shah from the shock of Teymourtache s arrest, aim w 0 ^ [315 ee—1]would manage without this intimate counsellor. We now know tne answer, which is that he tries to do everything himself He trusts Feroughi and, we believe Avrom How far Ayrom ever dares speak to him on political as opposed to police and military and business matters is not known. We may be sure from our knowledge of Feroughi’s character that he never aigues or speaks up m any matter which might land him in any sort of bother. He wants a quiet hfe, m contrast to Teymourtache, who hated one. So there is nobody who can be trusted to speak his mind or even to repeat unpalatable truths to His Majesty, and as a result the Shah’s character is deteriorating. He is becoming more and more susceptible to flattery and more sensitive to newspaper criticism He suffers, like all his race from an overwhelming inferiority complex, and his loneliness and a lack of friends or counsellors is increasing the complex. He only feels happy and at home among his soldiers; he also knows that they are the Praetorian Guard on whom his existence and the continuation of his dynasty depends. They have been largely augmented in the last two years by conscription, and probably now number about 100,000. The army absorbs more than half the revenues of the country and is pampered in everything. A big proportion lies always ready to the Shah’s hand all around the capital, where new barracks seem to spring up almost overnight in the desert. The whole air force of over fifty machines is concentrated at Tehran. As long as the troops remain loyal the dynasty is safe. But what will a schemer like General Ayrom do when the Shah is dead ? I believe that the material progress recently is proceeding very much ahead of intellectual or moral progress, and that therein lies a great problem of the future. Can a nation survive if she casts off all that is best along with all that is worst in the traditions of the past? Material progress is evident from the rapid extension of the railway up the mountain side towards Firuzkuh; the opening of the Chains road to Mazanderan, both of them great engineering feats in which the help of foreign experts has been successfully utilised. Road construction in other parts of Persia has been going ahead, although less rapidly when away from the capital, the most important new artery being probably the road joining Tabriz with Rowanduz and Mosul. The Shah’s visit to Turkey by road from Tabriz to Trebizond will probably bear fruit in the near future in the improvement in that line of communications. A direct road from Resht to Tabriz is being pushed through. A new road is to be built from Tehran to Amol in Mazanderan, via Pelur in the Lar Valley. Thus it is apparent that the maximum effort is being concentrated on providing an outlet alternative to Russia for the products of the fertile Caspian provinces. These products, apart from the staple rice, include silk, jute, cotton, timber, fruit, oranges, charcoal. Fish, although the biggest industry after rice, are not included, as the Russian monopoly precludes their being exported anywhere except to and through Russia. In considering this question of the opening up of the coastal provinces, one salient fact must not be lost sight of, namely, that the Shah owns the whole of Mazanderan and Tunekabun and part of Gilan, and that his properties are rapidly being augmented. For instance, he has recently acquired the land round Amql, hence the projected new road. The Shah is extremely proud, and hates the idea that he, as a landlord as well as King, is economically in the clutches of the Soviet Government. He is looking everywhere for a bolt-hole—Turkey, Iraq, Persian Gulf. This motive, combined with lhat of prestige, makes the completion ot the Trans-Persian Railway during his lifetime a fetish for him. The big puce to be paid for the railway (£24 million) and the roads weigh as nothing against the idea that, in the end, he will have freed his country and the personal pioperty of his family from the position of a hostage in the hands of the hated Russians. Economic and financial wisdom must, if need be remain subordinate to political expediency. pis king hi M f slams. Tli iJtleiestmct If i m statad &lt; fits put up fi ion is 1 b’sneeds; tli pi! land.

The last twenty-one months have also witnessed a good deal of municipal progress; the streets of Tehran are being paved with granite blocks, at great expense, but to the vast improvement of the town’s amenities; new buildings are being rushed up in anticipation of a visit from the Turkish Gazi. The group of buildings round the Bagh-i-Milli, which include a vast police station, significant of the power of General Ayrom, and a museum, will be quite a handsome addition to the town; the new National Bank premises, in the style of Persepolis, look promising. Gradually Tehran is assuming the aspect of a civilised town, though it will never be what the Persians think—a rival in beauty and modernity to the great cities of Europe. In the provincial centres similar progress is being made, and new squares, electrically illuminated, are taking the place of slums. The sad thing is that the money is all spent on show; not one town has a decently drinkable water supply, nor is public hygiene carried much beyond the destruction of the more obviously distressing rubbish in the streets. Slums, as stated above, are being destroyed, but the poor are not having tenements put up for them, and are, instead, merely being huddled together into the slums that remain. Irrigation is being neglected instead of being treated as the first of the country’s needs; there is ample scope, as an Italian engineer with long Egyptian experience told me, for water storage enough to increase beyond all measure the arable land. In fact, agriculture, except on the Boyal lands, is being neglected in the excitement over factory building. Sheep-farming is likely to suffer from the attempts now being made to settle the semi-nomadic tribes, which produce the finest wool, into permanent villages. Landowners are feeling the pinch of taxation, and the peasants are suffering accordingly. In some districts attempts are being made to force the peasants to grow new crops. Opium has been greatly restricted by taxation, but the alternative crops, such as cotton, do not bring m what opium did in the old days; in some places, such as Yezd and Kerman, where ,a rice crop used to be grown for local needs, this crop has been forbidden, nominally to prevent the spread of malaria, but really, so they say locally, because the Shah wants to force the people to buy his Mazanderan rice. Tribal settlement seems to be progressing, and there has been no large-sca e tribal rising since I came here, although the Baluchistan frontier tn es a\e never been pacified, and are at present giving much trouble I e av lan seem to be crushed, and it looks as if the delay in bringing the ring ea eis trial was due to uncertainty on the Shah’s part regarding how ar ^ ^ c risk of trouble in Bakhtiari if the khans were punished. When e T i strong enough he struck, and the result was the recent condemnation . Kashgai tribe also seem broken. A big tribal rising seems ess lie y , i at any time in Reza’s reign; he has probably destroyed the feudal system thong his early death might lead to a final flare-up.

On the ot her ha^ education seems to be making progress; a non Ministrv of Education., Jewish and Bahai, have to conform to the rul f.f and failure to do so has caused the closure of the Bahai schools. g schools have had to adopt Persian names pHncation and here, I think, This brings me naturally to the s^bje . ^ attending school is progress must be recorded, and the number T ^ h ^ k t t q we iiers rapidly increasing. I was interested to see ^ i^nother tent “ village ” m the Ear Valley plodding . severa lSi i JL pnoimh but the number of at least b 2mrtial literates in the next generation will be several hundredfold that of the present adult literate population. Among the upper and middle classes the larne number of boys educated abroad are returning and making themselves felt. b The administration of justice under Davar undoubtedly made great strides; the impetus has since somewhat slowed down. There are still failures to keep the practice up to the standard set by theory, and in the Parsons case we put our finger upon a serious lapse. Other trials in which foreigners have been involved include the Lindenblatt trial, which was fairly conducted, and the Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation’s case against Kazeruni, in which, after a o'ood deal of anxiety, the company had justice done them. Political trials of Persians could, no doubt, be criticised if the evidence were published, but, as they are conducted by court-martial and in camera, we do not know whether there is any attempt at justice. Teymourtache, Diba, the Bakhtiari Khans, and others, have been condemned by such courts in the last few months. It is not a system of which English people can approve, but it is quite civilised compared with recent German methods of dealing with political opponents. Finance is a subject on which I hesitate to be dogmatic. There seems to be plenty of money available for every kind of extravagance, but all of the reserves represented by' the Anglo-Persian Oil Company £4 million windfall and the foreign exchange accumulations have been spent. There is a fantastic gold cover for the note issue, but the tempting course of printing new notes is now being favoured and, if continued long enough, will lead to inflation and a fall of the rial; perhaps if such a fall could be kept within manageable limits this would be all to the good for the country’s trade. The rial, which has appreciated in value by almost 25 per cent, in the last twenty-one months, now stands so high that Persian products are difficult to export. The Shah’s confidence in Colonel Amir Khosrovi, the manager of the National Bank, is leading that rather amateur banker to interfere in trading matters more and more, to the embarrassment of the Minister of Finance. The bank seems to aspire to functions outside its scope and may well be heading for a crash. Exports are, in fact, becoming more and more the problem of the hour. How can they be stimulated? Carpets are selling very badly; rice is subject to the whims of Russia; other products, always excepting oil, which does not figure in the Persian trade balance statistics, are almost unsaleable. Moreover, the more Persia becomes self-sufficing by manufacturing its own cotton, silk and other goods, the less she will buy abroad, so that foreign trade will come almost to a standstill, except for the motor trade and big orders of machinery for Government purposes. I cannot help feeling that Persia is much nearer a serious financial crisis than when I arrived, and that before many months she will have to resort to some sort of foreign financial assistance. The taxable limit must almost have been reached now that income tax is being levied on incomes as small as £30 a year, incomes which are already having to bear the burden of the sugar and tea monopoly taxes, which amount, with road tax and freights, to about 600 per cent. ad valorem. In fact, it is doubtful whether the poor in Persia have ever been worse off. Travellers from Iraq always remark on the povertv they meet after crossing the frontier, and even in Tehran one cannot help being struck by the beggais and the astonishing rags in which they are clothed. The only rich people, comparatively speaking, are the army of all'ranks. They have great scope for oppression and corruption, and from all accounts they make the most of their So much for material and visible progress; moral progress is more difficult to measure, but such as is being achieved is probably chiefly in the realm of the emancipation and education of women. Polygamy has been practically killed by economic s a mgency and, with its disappearance and greater religious laxity, eie seems o be little doubt that prostitution has grown a good deal. The • f lan f ^ mbas sador not himself considered in Persian eves to be a paragon of virtue, tells me that he is greatly shocked at the rapid increase of open soliciting * m A; st , re n S °1 the town ’ and that he considers that the women here have no matter ^ ^ ihere 18 ce ^ taml y 110 lon g er an V of the Moslem secrecy about such Iffih ^ gjli'nnw they sal I do not ijjf? is in tint d. iftack ^ ^ jofParliamen Bfdoesnotwo] led into licen( ® forms and lekthePersi Irek constrain civeiYcha] 1 ley dare ns m and they er n ^~ er deen a stron g point of the Persians and I have irAlsP g of an y improvement in this direction.

Corruption is rife in spite of the Shah’s genuine efforts to suppress it, and the high customs duties make smuggling and the bribery connected therewith universal. The police are said to be venal to the last degree. Patriotism might be supposed to be the great feature of modern Persia, but I doubt whether it is real patriotism which dictates such nonsensical outbursts of nationalism as the order to foreigners to call Persia ££ Iran.” I also doubt whether there are many Persians who would not be prepared for a large enough sum to sell their countryprovided they could be sure of not being found out. Formerly, the Persians excelled in a critical sense and were not slow to exercise it; now they dare not, because all liberty of speech and writing is suppressed. I do not suggest that matters have got worse just lately, but the tendency is in that direction because of the terror caused by the disgrace of Teymourtache. As for the old £ £ constitutional ’ ’ movement which led to the creation of Parliament, it seems that everybody is reconciled to the idea that democracy does not work here and that liberty, after the revolution of 1906, merely degenerated into licence. Good manners and formal politeness have gone with the disappearance of religious forms and only linger among the poorer classes and provincials. Nevertheless, the Persians of good family, who are not in Government employment and thereby constrained to show foreigners that they are no better than anyone else, are still very charming in their social relations and hospitable and generous if only they dare risk meeting foreigners. The Persians are not by nature xenophobe and they enjoy European society. The present ban distresses them. V. A. L.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of despatch No. 64 from His Majesty’s consul, Kermanshah, dated the 21st December, on the subject of his journey to Pusht-i-Kuh. Tehran, December 28, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Summerhayes to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen. (No. 64.) Sir, Kermanshah, December 21, 1934. I HAVE the honour to report that I went yesterday by motor to Husseinabad, formerly Deh-Bala, the capital of Pusht-i-Kuh, as the province is still always known, though its name wms officially changed back to Eilam some years ago. It is, I believe, fifteen years since any of my predecessors went there, so when the Governor of Kermanshah said on the previous day that there was no objection to my going, it seemed as well to do so quickly lest he should think of one, for travel in Pusht-i-Kuh has not been encouraged in the past. 2. From Shahabad to Husseinabad is a distance of 85 miles by the road which was opened in 1932 after long and costly work; if one could go direct the distance between those two places would be more than halved. The work done on the actual road and the pacification that it has made possible in a previously disturbed area is impressive. The road, on which I am sending a separate report, passes fertile valleys and very large oak forests, and also crosses two formidable ranges, through the top of one of which a tunnel had to be bored for a distance of some 150 yards. Heavy lorries have been using the road to carry building material to Husseinabad. . i p 3. The main lorry traffic recently on the road has been fetching w ea oi the Tehran municipality from the Shah’s estates, which now re ^9 Shahabad to the Renau range, a distance of 60 miles along the rc &gt; a( -h e took over Crown and private land there these last two years, an is new s stores for grain have been constructed in several places, the mam one Kofrabad, 20 miles from Shahabad, at the end of the large plain jus e aa 4 a hrange.ie ^ ^ ^ ver y fertile Aivan plain, some stone houses and a model garden were in course of construction, mainly as mode s or 0 f who are being encouraged to live in houses and to cultiva e a grea e , crops and vegetables. Similar gardens have been made Husseinabad and Mansurabad, and the idea is certainly soun . f ma 5. In that large Aivan valley, through which flow the ^ waters the angir River, that further down are a cause of friction at E, accustaned is the only village passed on the route. The tribesmen aw. u„ rs -phe keep to their tents all through the year, and they a ! r e , s ^® t -u which I have ly tent dwellers with whom I spoke belonged to the Julak t , f t been able to identify.

About recent frontier troubles, which were the subject of my despatch No 61 of the 26th October, I did not speak much. In talking of waters which passed to Iraq, he said that as more villages were being built m Persia a larger volume was needed from the Gangir and other rivers, and he seemed to ignore the fact that half the volume had been promised by Persia under the 1911 Frontier Commission. . . , , 11.

He was described in 1910 as “ a pleasant young man, without much character, and fond of drink. He enjoyed a reputation for poetic ability, and possessed a considerable library of his own. He sided against the Government in the abortive rebellion of 1929 (see annual report for 1929, paragraph 233), and is said to have drawn up the detailed plans for the capture of Isfahan and Tehran and the deposition of the Shah. He was well known to Mr. Monypenny and several other consular officers, by whom he was generally liked. Sardar Iqbal, the son of Isfandiar Khan, was described in 1909 as “a pleasant young man, and friendly to the British, though deficient in force of character.” He has entertained several British travellers at various times. He is said to have been against the Government in 1929. Ali Mardan Khan Chahar-Lang, the son of Bibi Mariam, is mentioned in the above-quoted paragraph of the 1929 annual report as receiving a pardon. I have not yet been able to trace any record of Gudarz Ahmed Khusruvi Bakhtiari, but believe him to be one of the lesser khans who sided with Sardar Fateh and his companions in 1929. 4. The remaining four persons who have been executed are not Bakhtiaris. Sartip Khan and Shukrullah Khan were leaders of the Boir Ahmedi tribe in their opposition to the Government in 1930 and 1931; the former is referred to in the annual reports of 1930 and 1931, paragraphs 186 and 300, respectively. Hussein Khan Darehshuri was a Qashqai chief or “ kalantar,” and Imam Quli Khan one of the ringleaders of the Mamassani tribe, for many years in opposition to the Government; they both took part in the troubles in Fars in 1929 and 1930. 5. Of those sentenced to imprisonment, all of whom are Bakhtiaris, I need only mention specifically the following : Amir Jang and Amir Hussein Khan weie the two Bakhtiari Deputies in the Majlis whose freedom from arrest was withdrawn by vote of the Majlis last December. Both were well known in Tehran circles. Amir Jang was a brother of the late Minister of War, Sardar Asad; and Amir Hussein Khan was a son of the late Sardar Zafar, K.B.E.; he was umvei sally liked, and, until very shortly before his arrest, used to play polo with the members of the British club. Yusuf Khan Amir Mujahid has spent most of his long life m a series of intrigues, and will not be missed; it will be remembered that he was the evil genius of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, to whom he is related by marriage. Khan Baba Khan was another well-known Bakhtiari, who speaks English and has a reputation for being pro-British; he also is a brother of the late Minister of War. 6. Shahab-us-Saltaneh, now a man of about 60, has lived in seclusion at iehran for some years; he is a son of the late Haji Abbas Quli Khan, and was escnbed m 1909 as a pleasant, well-meaning young man, without conspicuous t 1 iv? u - u ammad Quli Khan Asad, better known as Sardar Bahadur, is another brother of the late Minister of War; it is good to see that he is set free a ei is ye^r m puson, as he has always been a loyal supporter of the Govern- re a special eliinreD their i ^military st( jprdMafl Je other still .5 nil which ba g dmeits in th flan probal gi,Boir Ahmi [B Elder whit iment.

The veil of secrecy has thus been lifted from the arrests of a year ago Thirty-six persons are now accounted for, eight being shot, twenty imprisoned' and eight set tree; all being Bakhtiaris except four of those who were shot’ 1 Nothing has yet been revealed, however, concerning the trial or the accusations'- 1 the court was a specially convened military tribunal. Having no official news whatever, I am driven to make the best I can of the rumours which are circulating with their usual rapidity. I gather from them that the fantastic story of the military stores and rifles referred to in my predecessor’s despatch No. 144 of the 23rd March last was not pursued, owing to a total lack of evidence • nor was the other still more fantastic story of a plot to kill the Shah at the Turkoman laces last autumn, doubtless for the same reason. The prosecution had therefore to hark back to 1929. Now we have no documents bearing on the terms under which Samsam-us-Saltaneh and Amir Mufakham induced the dissident elements in the tribe to submit to the Government in that year, but it seems more than probable that, in that case, as with the rebellious Qashqais, Mamassanis, Boir Ahmedis, &amp;c., a safe-conduct was given to the rebels as part of the terms under which they were induced to give themselves up to the mercy of the Government. In that case, the true lessons to be drawn from this sorry business are: first, that the Shah was determined to seize upon any pretext to punish what is, perhaps, the most independent of his tribes; secondly, that he felt more able to do so in 1934 than he did in 1929; and, thirdly, that no more reliance is to be placed on promises of safe-conduct given by the Pahlevi dynasty than on those given by the Qajars, or any other of Persia’s rulers. 8. Such savage sentences constitute a more severe punishment than Reza Shah has hitherto inflicted on any tribe. Viewed from a historical point of view, however, they are only another incident in the long struggle between the Central Government and the Bakhtiaris, described from the Bakhtiari point of view in the moving pages of Layard’s Eo.rly Adventures, and from a more detached standpoint by Lord Curzon (cf. especially pp. 292-294 of volume II of his Persia 0 Md the Persian Question). 9. I gather that one widely-held view is that, once the Shah had imprisoned all these tribesmen, he had to sentence them, for his own safety. He has certainly punished them all, as even the liberated ones spent about a year in prison. It must not be forgotten, however, that a few of the principal khans were never imprisoned at all, for example, Murteza Quli Khan, Sardar Muhtashim, and Amir Mufakham. 10. It is not easy to esti mate the effect of the sentences. Nothing has appeared in the Persian press by way of comment, except a formal notice by the Tehran Isfandiary family (the head of which is Haji Mutashim-us-Saltaneh) drawing attention to the obvious fact that they are not related to any of the Bakhtiaris. The Bakhtiari tribe is supposed to be settling down gradual y to an urban mode of life; the registration department states that about 50 per cen of the tribe has received civil registration documents ; and Persian Govemmen officials are gradually assuming control of the judicial, hscal, an o ei administrative activities of the tribe. However, there are still many kh ans le , and their memories are long. 1 haV H &amp; M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN.Register No. P. z. J£C 1?£ T Minute Paper. 49/35. Political Department.

Tehran, November 7, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul-General Gastrell to Sir R. Hoare. (No. 139 A/13. Confidential.) Meshed, October 24, 1934. 4 HAVE the honour to record the following events connected with the visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to Khorassan, and which extended from the 10th to the 16th October, 1934. 2. The Shah, who had left Tehran by motor car on the 8th October, was welcomed at the provincial boundary at Assadabad by the chief local officials, and, after spending the nights of the 8th and 9th October at Shahrud and Sabzewar, reached Meshed on the 10th October according to programme. No “ istiqbal ” by consular corps or worthies was permitted. Wednesday, October 10. 3. At about 4-30 p.m. His Imperial Majesty reached a point about 3 miles from Meshed, and there inspected 5,600 artillery, cavalry and infantry of the Eastern Army. He expressed his satisfaction with the parade. At 5-30 p.m. His Imperial Majesty reached the shrine of Imam Reza, and was received with customary pomp and ceremony. The newly completed Tehran Avenue and approaches to the shrine were densely crowded with sightseers and gaily decorated with flags and houses illuminated. After performing the pilgrimage and partaking of the ceremonial tea, he received the chief priests and officials, and then entered his motor car to continue his journey to the mansion in the ££ West End ” which had been arranged for his reception. The Royal car, which was well lighted, proceeded at a slow speed and gave the clapping populace ample opportunity of seeing His Majesty. Whilst passing the consulate-general, which opens on to the main Pahlevi Avenue, His Majesty appeared to be attracted by the illuminations and decorations as he leant forward and seemed to bow to the company assembled on the pavement in front of the entrance door. As is customary, no one was allowed on the first floors of buildings on the Royal route. At the entrance to his residence he was met by the local officials. The Directois of Customs and Revenue he greeted as Director of Smugglers and Thieves respec tively, and ordered the Representative of Justice to punish them for their sins. Thursday, October 11. _ 4. At 9-30 a.m. the.Shah visited the military cantonment in the new city ‘‘ Shahr-i-Nau ” to the west of the city and adjacent to his F es ^f“ c ®; Jt® 1 ' d has it that he expressed dissatisfaction with the barracks newly constructed a under construction. His visit to the kitchens was also pamful as he did approve of the taste of the food which was being cooked. Jhe General C Commanding (General Iraj Khan) was reprimanded and cautioned. Later, [290 c—9]11 a.m., the Shah decided £ nol only the main block cereXny He ias pleased with the look of the perform the long-pla [&gt; R imoosing but advised Asadi (Mutuwal STfo Sf^h ” Tnd not the 300 planned. Friday, aftern&lt;»no^d^orientalists^vho had e arrived U in Meshed the previous dav), the forty members of the Majlis heads of Departments and the consular corps, he declared open the memorial tomb of Firdausi, the Persian poet and historian, who died 1,000 years ago. After this simple ceremony and an examination of the structure the Shah returned to Mes e . Saturday, October 13. n . 6 In the morning the Shah motored the 48 miles to his recently and very profitably acquired estate at Fariman, on the Meshed-Herat road He was accompanied by Asadi, who pointed out the sights. After promising to endow a school for 250 boys in place of the one existing for thirty, the Shah proceeded to examine the Band-i-Fariman, a colossal dam situated some 4 miles from the village. The title-deeds of the estate were formally handed over by Asadi and the party returned to Meshed by 5 p.m. Sunday, October 14. 7 In the evening His Majesty visited another only-just-finished edifice, the Shahpur Club and Theatre. (This building was built with money which remained over from the internationally subscribed Kuchan Earthquake Relief Fund of 1929 and was until a week before the Shah’s arrival ornamented with a Red Lion and Sun of the society of that name.) His Excellency Jam, Minister of Interior, and recently Governor-General here, was congratulated by His Majesty on this work, which Jam (so he says) initiated. Later, His Imperial Majesty visited the Shrine Boys’ School and an exhibition of Khorassan products. These latter were excellently displayed in a local cinema hall and received well-merited praise. Monday, October 15. 8. The Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs (Faiz Mohamed Khan), accompanied by Sirdar Asadullah Khan, a brother of the ex-Ameer Amanullan Khan, who had arrived in Meshed from Afghanistan the previous evening, were reported to have been granted an audience by His Imperial Majesty the Shan. The Afghan Ambassador at Tehran was also in the reception. Tuesday, October 16. 9.

Accompanied by his Highness Feroughi (Premier) and his Excellency Jam (Minister of Interior) and a number of members of the Majlis, the Royal visitors left in their motors at 8-30 a.m. for Kuchan and Bujnurd and Turkoman races. 10. The general impression is that the Shah was really pleased with Meshed, its improvements and progress. His last visit was in November 1930, when his progress was accompanied by a series of punishments and explosions. 11. There was a complete absence of ceremonial, and troops did not even line the roads, along which there were stationed policemen at 50-yard intervals. On his morning excursions His Majesty did not take any companions or escort. He congratulated Asadi (Mutuwalli Bashi), the mayor, and the designer ot the new hospital on their excellent achievements. 12. Immediately His Majesty left Meshed work on roads and elsewheie ceased, and a nearly finished main bridge remains untouched for a week now. iq a — T j -i • . ^ ^ to the 13.

Hoare to bir John Simon.—{Received November 19.) (No. 485. Very Confidential.) ^ ir ’ Tehran, November 3, 1934. 1 HAVE the honour to report that the oriental secretary recently received a visit fi om an old friend who had spent the previous ten months in prison in Tehran under suspicion of complicity in the alleged Bakhtiari “ plot.” He gave Mr. Trott a rough account of his experiences during his incarceration. 2. He had been asked a great number of questions, the motive being to discover what dealings he had had with the Bakhtiaris. He was questioned as to his relations with Major Bremner, with Mr. Trott, with the Italian Mountaineering Expedition and with Sardar Assad. He replied to these questions in a negative manner, stating that he knew nothing about Major Bremner and that his relations with the Italians had been purely as a guide. He was also questioned about relations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Bakhtiari khans. 3. The khans are for the most part in the No. 2 division of the Tamin'at prison. They are not badly looked after, though they are kept separate. Amir Hussein Khan and Amir Jang, however, are still kept in No. 1 cells, which are darker and even damper than the No. 2. Sardar Bahadur is at Qasr-i-Qajar. The unfortunate Rashidi is in a No. 2 cell; it appears that he is suffering from rheumatism and it is probable that he will not long survive. Mr. Trott’s informant was surprised how well he was treated. He had his regular food and even cigarettes. His great difficulty was the complete absence of a bath; he had no bath during the whole period of the ten months and the cells were, moreover, swarming with vermin. He formed the impression that his interrogators themselves were in the dark as to what they were trying to find out. They asked him the same questions time and time again. Some, he knew, had resigned or had at least tried to, but their resignations were never accepted. He paid tribute to the kindness shown him by General Ayronp but stated that he did not believe that he could very long continue to hold his position. 4. He stated that in his opinion the origins of the accusation against the Bakhtiaris sprang from some intrigues by one of the wives of Sardar Bahadur. Nothing was ever discovered about any plot for the simple reason that there was no plot. The scheme no doubt was to confiscate all the khans’ property. 5. Mr. Trott’s visitor stated that a continuous stream of prisoners came into the prison while he was there. One was accused of forming a plot against the Shah, but was eventually released; another was a man who owned property worth 30,000 tomans in Mazanderan; he was pressed by the Shah to sell for 2,000. This he countered by begging the Shah to take it for nothing. In such cases the victim is imprisoned until he agrees to sign for the Shah s price. 6. Mr. Trott was also told that the Shah now supplies 80 per cent, of the army’s requirements, not only grain, rice, &amp;c., but also boots and clothing. The Royal fortune must be accumulating like a snowball. 7. The two army leaders who appear to have the most influence now aie 'epahbod Ahmad Agha and Amanullah Mirza, but the focus of any discontent r as more likely to be somebody outside Persia, perhaps laqizadeh, who, as 1 ave reported elsewhere, has given various indications of his intention not to 'turn to Persia 8. To the occidental mind it would appear inevitable that after years oppression such as is recorded above, the Persian worm would eventually m h it must be remembered that this oppression is not a new mg m eisia, think it most unlikely that there will be any open resistance to the regime at ast until after the death of the Shah.

British Legation, / Tehran. 19th October, 1934. Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 445 (E 5293/ 1289/34) of September 5th, I have the honour to inform you that the past fortnight has been devoted, almost to the exclusion of all other business, to the celebration of the millenary of the poet Firdausi. 2. was to be expected, Firdausi was merely an excuse for advertising the glorious resurrection Oi Persia under the rule of Eeza Shah Pahlevi and tne press has excelled itself in fulsome adulation. Of the large number of learned foreigners Invited to visit as the guests of the Government forty five eventually came, including Sir E. Denison Ross, 0*1. E., and Mr. John Drinxwatar. The Soviet Union were very strongly represented by six delegates, but the Persians also paid great attention to professor V. Minorsky, a * white Russian from London University, whose genuine learning was appreciated. A feature of the celebrations kas, however, been the constant public exchange of speeches and telegrams with the Union of Soviet hoeia*ist Republics, and the prime Minister, in his speech at the Government banquet, went out of hie way to speak Russia. 3 , Every hour of the day was fully ™ a PP ed out for the orientalists who were regaled hy eountlese banquets, theatrical perfor»anoes and excursions, to most /of The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.0.S.1*# etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.of wiiieh the Diplomatic Corps were also invited. a ’♦congress 11 was held daily and might have been expected to produce interesting discussions on literature and art but for the fact that its limited time was a good deal wasted by such items as a lecture of one and a half hours by a Persian army officer extolling Firdausi as an authority on strategy, and a long propagandist harangue by the German Minister who delivered to the Prime Minister a Degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Berlin University and at the same time presented about fifty volumes of works by German authors. The Soviet Ambassador also used the Congress as a platform for oratory, and present reproductions of fifteen Sassanian treasures (presumably the famous 'Treasure of the Oxus* 1 ) in the Hermitage Museum. 1 felt it more seemly not to trespass in the field of learning and to leave to Sir Denison Doss and Mr. Driakwater the task of representing British scholarship and letters, which they admirably fulfilled. As the speeches by the forty five delegates were made in alphabetical order, it fell to Sir Denison to speak on the last day of the Congress, when he presented the Turner Macan edition of the 'Shahnameh* suitably inscribed as the gift of His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom to the Persian Government and made a short speech of congratulations, in the course oi wnic delivered to the Congress, in accordance with your instructions, the greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Governaent. Mr. yrinkwater had, on a previous day, i©cited said much applause a poem which he had composed on the Journey. The next day, to everybody's delight, the Persian poet laureate read out a version of this poe.a i ‘ i verse which he had written during the night. The Acting Minister of Education, in closing the Congress, /speechspeech in English in which he gave due credit to the work of British scholars of the nineteenth Century in popularising and translating the *Shann&amp;meh*. #* The survivors of tnis orgy of hospitality left on October 10th for Meshed, several of the more infirm having firmly resisted the temptation of six days motoring over Persian roads, even if the prize were to be the spectacle of the dhah himself unveiling the memorial over the poet’s tomb at Tus. Incidentally, I hear that the learned men were a good deal hurt at not having been received by His Majesty at Tehran. 5. The very elaborate and expensive arrangements made by the Persian authorities on the five hundred and fifty miles of road from Tehran to Meshed resulted in the safe arrival at the latter place of all the orientalists who started, Including professor Minors icy, ^ r • Brinkwater, Dastoor Hoshsrawan (a parsi High Priest from poonaj, Dr. Unvala, and one or two Indian scholars. powerful cars performed the tedious journey in three stages. A special visit was mad© to the recently constructed monument erected over the supposed site of the grave of umar Khayyam Mshspur. This monument consists of an obelisk some twelve feet high, on a platform approached by stone steps; it is carved in an elegant shape and Dears eight of ^ msr s known quatrains incised in Persian, the letters being blackened with a view to increased legibility. part jf one of the corners of the obelisk had already fallen off (unless indeed the carver’s hand had slipped »hen it was hastily prepared a few months ago) anu ® oae Jl tA,e were already beginning to disappear; the stone employ in fact, appears to have been very soft; The monument itself is dwarfed by the huge ’aiwan’ or platfox f /shrine4 - ■xn&gt; shrine by Its side, erected in the time of shah Tahraagp in celebration of an obscure relative of Imars size who, ae the guardian of the shrine was ready to explain to everyone who asked, was burned alive for incestuous intercourse with his daughter. The garden in which these two memorials are contained was a peaceful ind beautiful enclosure in the best Persian tradition; several tents had been erected therein for the delectation of the distinguished visitors. ¥r. Drinkwater exte^tporised, on entry therein, a little poem in two verses which he wrote out, signed, and presented to his guide, Dr. Sadiq, much to the latter’® joy. 6. On arrival on the evening of the 11th October at Meshed, the night temperature having fallen to seven degrees of frost, accommodation was immediately allotted to each savant; most were given a room in a newly erected hotel, though Mr. Drinkwater was, with the knowledge and consent of the Persian authorities, allowed the advantage oi the comfort and warmth of the British Consulate-General, where Mr. Trott had already arrived. It is to him that 1 am indebted for the account of the subsequent proceedings. 7. The principal ceremony of the whole festival was the formal opening of the newly built nausaoleu i Pirdausi at Tus (some seventeen miles fr ok yesneu? on the following day. Guests were invited for two p.m., and on arrival were regaled in large tents with tea ana cakes for nearly two hours. They thus had ample time to loo* at outside of the monument.

He arrived accompanied by about a dozen officers in uniform and was led by the prime minister and the Minister of Interior to the line of waiting savants, who had tne post of honour directly facing the mausoleum. His Majesty was in good humour and pi aye a his part admirably. He remarked on first approaching the imposing building 1 What a pity it’s so small 1 . He shook hands with all the savants and conversed with some of them, notably with professor Minorsky, whose perfect command of idiomatic Persian stood him in gooa stead. He studied with some care the voluminous white robes of the Farsi High Priest, and enquired the exact nature of the Kaisar-i-Hind decoration which he was proudly wearing. When he reached the Turkish orientalists, both of whom wore frock coats and carried bowler hats, trie senior of bnem, Fuad Bey, detained him for some minutes in oruer to deliver to His Majesty a personal message from the ahazi.

Having shaken hands with everyone in the front row, His Majesty mounted the first tier of steps, read out a short speech composed in suitable terms, and cut the tape surrounding the foot of the mausoleum. He and his following then disappeared from view into the interior of the monument, descending through a small opening in the west side. A large marble slab, highly polished and excellently cut with a short Persian inscription bearing Firdausi’s name, was to be found in the centre of the floor of a simple , unadorned chamber. His Majesty sent for the stone-cutter who produced this masterpiece and conveyed to him the Royal approval* After some minufces His Majesty came out and began to walk towards the outer gate. Seeing a group of Persians to whom he had not spoken, he enquired who they were; hut on hearing that they were the heads of local departments he turned away with a gesture of impatieno Hor did he take any special notice of a group ot saae fifty neahera of the Kejllss, who were headed hy fladgar, the President, and the two Vice-Presidents# 10. On His Majesty's departure, the assembled orftwd examined the Mausoleum at their leisure.

U ’ ,phllt ni &amp; ht Prime Minister gave a dinner to the visitors; owing to some difficulty over the repast began an hour late and all the elaborate dishes were cold. several speeches were made after* dinner, however, full of the usual laudatory references; one being pronounced (according to professor Minor sky) in Pahlevi, a language which has been dead for more than a thousand years. The Prime Minister made an eloquent and admirable reply. According to the original programme, the next day ehould have witnessed the official opening, by the Shah, of the new Hospital, an enormous and unbelievably decorated building designed to accommodate three hundred beds. The Shah, however, had unexpectedly visited the new building just after his arrival two days before. He had found that the vast interior contained only some of the beds, and hardly any of the equipment, which would be necessary; that the only Doctor hitherto engaged, a German, had only just arrived; and that in fact it would be some time before the hospital could commence operations. His Majesty therefore said that he would not open an unfinished thing, as if he did he knew pretty well that it never would be finished. However, the orientalists were duly shown round the premises that morning, and were duly impressed by the beautiful tiles, domes and pillars, as well as by the large number of smaller subsidiary buildings built in the same vast compound, including an isolation hospital, a kitchen, a maternity home, a children’s ward, an infectious hospital, and a block of Gtfflces. The whole ie to 000. have coat the revenues of the Shrine about seven hundr ed /thousandthousand Tomaas (not far from one hundred thousand pounds): a sum which is, I believe, rather less than the shrine*s annual income* Some of the foreign visitors, who did not object to wearing a Pahlevi hat and running the risk of dismemberment, were conducted round the holy shrine itself and were, (I understand from Mr. Drinkwater, who tried it) profoundly impressed by the transports of delirious fanaticism which they witnessed therein. fhe Guardian of the Shrine gave a luncheon party that day, though he was not himself able to be present as Hie Majesty had commanded his company on a visit of inspection to a large and fertile property not far from Meshed which His Majesty has lately acquired. Beginning (nominally) at noon, the last speech was not over till after three thirty. 14 # r&gt; other entertainments offered to the visitors were an inspection of an exhibition of local products, and a ceremony at the local headquarters of the Red .ion and Sun Society. A cinema film representing Firdausi and a conjurer were also provided. The exhibition of local products was surprielngly well presented, and snowed how diverse were the articles made or found in Khoras&amp;n, including, beside oaipets, turquoises, slcins, gums, dates, tiles pottery, spices, chocolates, etcetera, etcetera The orientalists finally left on the l&amp;tn 15 .

Just before my departure, I was informed that an Intelligence Officer had already been sent to Masjid-i- Suleiman to purchase horses and mules so, in order to give my visit the appearance of an unofficial excursion, I was accompanied by my wife# The presence of my clerk could, if necessary, be attributed to my ignorance of the road and the object of my visit to my desire to make myself acquainted with my district as soon after my arrival as possible and before the advent of the hot weather# In spi e of the apparent enthusiasm with which my proposed visit had been received by the Anglo Persian Oil Coy’s Officials in 'Fields* I was advised on arrival at Dar-i-Khasineh that the Chief was greatly perturbed at the news of my Impending arrival and it was suggested that I should even then postpone my visit until after his departure* /in ir Reginald H# Ho are, K.C#J!.G.» His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, etc#, etc#, etc#, British Legation, Tehran.In view of the i act that my domestic staff as well as the Persian clerks in the office and doubtless, the authorities in Ahwaz all knew of my intention to visit 1 asjid-i-Suieiman, it appeared to me particularly indiscreet to turn back at that stage so it was decided to regard my visit ae purely private and to forego all contact with Persian Officials. Mr. Blackford, the Commercial Superintendent of the Anglo Persian Oil Company in ^Fields”, whose guests we were, explained that curtesa kuli Khan was greatly upset at his in ability to receive me but he frankly admitted that he was scared to do anything which might hasten a family reunion in H The Better Land% particularly as everyone knew the breed of mules which had attracted the military officer to Mas^id-i- Suleiman* He referred to the recent misfortunes which had overtaken hi© family and to his fear of displaying any signs of mourning which might be interpreted a© an expression of sympathy and would inevitably lead to his own immediate arrest. He welcomed the opportunity which Moharrem afforded for even the slightest expression of grief. I sent a message in reply that I Quite understood his present difficulties and I was sorry if the coincidence of my visit with his had caused him any inconvenience but, in view of the private nature of my excursion, I hoped that he would excuse me if I delayed the honour of making his acquaintance to a later date. He informed Mr. Blackford that in spite of the attentive escort who had accompanied Mr. Vatkinson on his tour of the akhtiari country last year His imperial Majesty had called for 1 m explanation of the object of Mr. Atkinson’s visit and for a detailed report of their conversations, fhe Khan explained/' 2ilj that the Consul s arrival had been a complete surprise to hi® but that as a representative of His Majesty he could not do other than extend his hospitality.

IN confirmation of a recent telegram, I have the honour to report that the evening newspaper, IttiW&amp;t, of the 31st March, published, half-way down the third page and after a number of very unimportant announcements, the following paragraph :— Death .—Jafar Quli Khan Asad Bakhtiari, as the result of an attack of apoplexy in the prison hospital, bade farewell to this world on Thursday evening (the 29th March). 2. I understand that the event was announced to the ex-Minister of War’s family when it took place. The body was handed over to the relatives, and transported by Amir Mansur Khan, son of Sardar Muhtashim, to Isfahan for burial. 3. Asad, who, according to my records, was only about 52 years of age, had, nevertheless, already had an apoplectic stroke of a mild nature about a year ago, which incapacitated him from work for a few days. It is, therefore, quite possible that he really did have another one, after more than four months in prison. However, he is the third prominent official to die in prison recent^, and the event will no doubt be taken as proof that not only he, but Teymourtache and Ismail Khan Qashqai (Soulet-ed-Dowleh) were made away with by order oi the Shah. Rumours are rife that a number of the other khans have been similar y dealt with, one story saying that Sardar Bahadur, Khan Baba Khan, and tnree others were asphyxiated in their cell by the fumes of a charcoal brazier mtroduce after they had gone to sleep. . , ^ ^ 4. It is difficult to estimate the effect of this event on either the tribe or Persian public opinion. We are told that the tribe nowadays has turned against its own khans and takes no interest in their fate. We also hear that the genera view is that Asad, whose past, like that of most other Persians was not at all blameless, probably deserved all he got. But he was the son o f a , • Asad, a very popular figure, and one who took a most prommen pai establishment of the Persian Constitution. , „ in fhp 5.

Sir R. ffoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 28.) (No. 77.) Sir, Tehran, February 10, 1934. I HAVE the honour to report, in continuation of my despatch No. 581_of the 16th December last, that Tehran is still completely ignorant on the~sub]ect of the Bakhtiari “ plot ” and of the fate of the “ plotters.” A few days ago I heard simultaneously that Sardar Assad had been shot and that he was about to be set at liberty. 2. My Gerjuan colleague tells me that he recently said to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he did not wish to enquire of him the facts regarding the imprisonment of the Bakhtiari khans, but he did wish to know in what light the Persian Government would like the matter to be represented to the German Government. Kazemi, after an embarrassed silence, said : ££ It is the removal of the last traces of feudalism.” 3. From the Chief of Staff the military attache has gathered a rather similar impression. Major Pybus asked General Nakhchevan, w jth th e n aivete which is, pemiissible in 'dealing with that not highly intelli ge nt^man, whether other tribes than the Hakhliaris had officially recognised tribal leaders like the Ilkhani and Ilbeggi. The general replied that they had not, and that was the importance of the Bakhtiari position; he went on to suggest that the imprison ment of the khans, whom the Shah regarded as opposed to all progress, in spite of the fact that they are relatively civilised, was designed to test the strength of tribal feeling, and he left it to be inferred that, if the reaction were sluggish, the next step would probably be the abolition of the posts of Ilkhani and Ilbeggi, followed by conscription and a complete absorption of the tribe in the ordinary r d hi i n i s 1/ 1 * ^ t /1 o n 4. Meanwhile, the arrests have extended to some of the Bakhtiari khans resident in Isfahan and in the Bakhtiari country itself. In addition Mr. Watkinson reported on the 16th January that Hormuz Khan, the head qt the Bakhtiari guard at the oil-fields, and also the local land agent ot his brother-in-law Sardar Assad, had been arrested and brougnt to Ahwaz. His arrest followed a visit by Murteza Quli Khan Samsam, the Ilbeggi, who as een able to appoint a nominee of his own. ^ T ri i u 5. The supposition that the intrigues of Murteza Quh Khan have been responsible for the whole trouble has been strengthened by the dismissal of Amir Mufakham from the post of Ilkhani, and by the fact that Murteza Quli Khan is now both Ilkhani and Ilbeggi. He is thus able to retain, for the time being at any rate, the whole of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a ow the protection of the oil-fields. „ , , i • 6. Haji Khusrau Khan Ilkhan, K.B.E.

Hoare's despatch now submitted reports the various rumours circulating in Persia about the reason for^rrests. The facts are not at all clear but perhaps the simplest explanation is that the arrests were made as a preliminary to an attempt by the Central Government to bring the Bahhtiari country more under control in accordance with the usual policy of the Pahlavi r4gime. It is true that the Ilkhani and the Ilbeggi have not yet been molested but there are good reasons for not arresting them just at the moment/ 5041 2000 1.31manent (see paragraphs 3-5 of the enclosure to Sir R. Roarers despatch) and their time may cone before long. It is quite likely, nevertheless, that the Bakhtiari Khans themselves provided a suitable excuse for the arrests, since it is clear that they could not see eye-to-eye with the Government in its centralizing policy. The reason given to the Majlis for the Government’s action that 'certain persons have rr considered the security and development of the A Pahlavi r4gime to t&amp;e contrary to their personal interests' seems to support 'the-explanation ^ suggest ed- ab-ov». suits porrip[ p. z. 1 In any further communication on this subject, please quote “ * No. r\ t and address —not to any person by ifame, but to— •The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, , Lqjridon, SiW. 1 !

On about the 28th or 29th November he was sent to Tehran under escort from Mazanderan, whither he had gone to be present at the Turkoman races in attendance on His Imperial Majesty, and had distributed the prizes in his name. He has been in the Q asr _i-Q a jar prison ever since, though no official announcement or explanation has been made, and the staff of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, as well as the chief of police, profess complete ignorance of the reason for his detention. 2. Simultaneously with the news of this arrest rumours began to circulate in Tehran that all the Bakhtiari Khans present in Tehran had also been arrested, and from the evidence which I have been able to gather, it appears that most but not all of them were arrested shortly after the arrest of the Minister of War. The aged Ilkhani, Lutf Ali Khan (Amir Mufakham), his half-brother Ghulam Hussein Khan Bakhtiar (Sardar Mutashim), his cousin Haji Khuzrau Khan Ilkhan (Sardar Zafar), K.B.E., and, I believe, one or two minor khans, were spared, as were the two Bakhtiari Members of Parliament, Amir Hussein Khan Ilkhan (son of Sardar Zafar) and Muhammad Taghi Khan Asad (Amir-i-Jang) vounger brother of the Minister of War. But all the rest of the Bakhtiari Khans who were in Tehran were arrested on about the 30th ^ovembeir The following is a list of their names, as far as I have been able to ascertam^t e , though I fancy that one or two of the minor khans may have been omitted . Muhammad Quli Khan Asad (Sardar Bahadur), brother of the Minister of War, and commandant of the “Fateh cavalry regiment, edu for five years in London. + c x\Tw\ Manuohir Khan Asad (younger brother of the Minister of War). ^ Yusuf Khan Ilkhan (Amir Mujahid), brother of Sardar Zafai. o Muhammad Rahim Khan Ilkhan, son of Amu uja n $ Salar Arfa D Haji Abbas Ali Khan (Shahab-us-Saltaneh).

The constitutional immunity f j; 0 f of the Interior, Mirza did not last long. On the 10 th Decembe the yf a Pi s that “certain Mahmud Khan Jam (Mudir-ul-Mulk), j vp ] 0Dnien t of the Pahlavi regime persons have considered the security an , h a ve been guilty of conduct to be contrary to their personal detrimental to the State, which has necess Amir Hussein Khan Ilkhan, Three Deputies are accused of P ar t 1 ( TP a ^9 ’ a Q awam . In order that the Muhammad Taghi Khan Asad, and Ibrahim Khan t^awam [15 b—1] oproper legal process be set in motion it is necessai s that theii immunity be withdrawn.” The Government therefore formulated the following motion:- t£ The Mailis approves that Ibrahim Khan Qawam, Muhammad Taghi Khan Asad, and Amir Hussein Khan Ilkhan be subject to criminal prosecution, and that the investigation and the circumstances be brought tm the notice of the Majlis on completion.' ’ J This motion was passed unanimously . 4 . Almost in the same breath that the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave me this information, he told me that the Shah had been pi esent at the Council in A rvrAvinns dav. and that he had no idea of what the charm ° 5 xhe three persons mentioned had already been arrested at their houses early the same morning, and conveyed to the Qasr-i-Qajar prison. ’ 6 . The inevitable rumours have of course spread and multiplied, in the complete absence of any official statement beyond that of the Minister of the Interior. One report states that the Minister of War is already dead. The truth is only known, I believe, to the General Staff and His Imperial Majesty himself. I summarise below the chief types of explanation which rumour offers :— 7 . Perhaps the wildest story is to the effect that Asad, with the complicity of Karakhan, was the prime mover in a plot to assassinate the Shah. Two assassins are supposed to have been suborned to shoot His Majesty while in Mazanderan. They were despatched from Tehran after the Royal party had left. Subsequently, however, the news leaked out and the Shah was informed, and a telegram was sent from Tehran telling the two assassins that the game was off. This telegram was intercepted and sent to the Shah, who produced it to Sardar Asad, who was overwhelmed at this proof of guilt. No story which ' circulates here fails to contain something akin to a germ of fact. And so I report that, at about the time of the Shah’s departure for the races, I received, through the Persian post, an anonymous letter saying that the Shah would be killed in a day or two; I sent the letter at once to the head of the police, who told the oriental secretary the next day that he knew all about the writer, who was under arrest. But it seems most unlikely that Sardar Asad, who has enjoyed for so long a comfortable sinecure, which has enabled him, with no trouble, to exercise to the full his natural bent for gambling and general dissipation, should plot to remove the man on whom his comfort depended. It is pretty clear that if the Shah fell, Sardar Asad would fall too. As for the rest of the Bakhtiaris in Tehran, these unfortunate individuals have been, in fact, prisoners in Tehran for a long time, and, having nothing in particular to do except gamble, smoke opium, and wait for something fresh to happen, have all run into debt in the expensive life of the capital; it is therefore possible that their quite natural grievances should have found expression in talk which, when repeated by third parties, created an impression of sedition. 8 . Another explanation is that the Ilbeggi, Murteza Quli Khan, who is apparently still in office in the Bakhtiari area, has conducted an intrigue against the Minister of War, and made certain accusations against him to the Shah. d . no ^ er st01 7 i s That there has been an importation of arms into the Hakhtian area, secretly arranged by the khans in Tehran. Asad and other khans are supposed to have objected to the tribe being conscripted, saying that the Bakhtiaris could supply 20,000 irregulars with arms whenever the Government wanted, but that conscription was foreign to the susceptibilities of the tribesmen. 0. Another school of thought, or rather of rumour, attributes this sudden pioscnption to the continuance of the Shah’s policy of suppressing all tribal influence bit by bit; the Qashqais have been repressed' and the Qawam’s influence removed; the Lurs have been transplanted and turned into railway navvies; now is the time for the Bakhtiaris to be brought to heel. Some two or three years ago 1 eymourtache told an Englishman here that ‘ ‘ the turn of the Bakhtiari would come m due course.” . wen Basidu has not been forgotten, and one story relates that ' cause of all the trouble was the interception by the Governor of Isfahan ol ® { vo ™ S{ I rd ^ As . ad to the Ilbeggi, in which the former stated th go e asidu dispute, Anglo-Persian relations were strained, and 1 | As regat illtiariki 1 ifc Stall’s c j ^iteGovernn: ptemumber 11 , Have; 3 i to make! klVBak ■ ifiiee to fin Resists. T1 I tie Shaks c kb ffequ ^Aateve k I enck yikwa; A 1 am i foment of and tBakhtiaris should be ready to take advantage of any difficulties into which the Central Government might fall as a result. There is, indeed, some reason to think that the misinteipietation of a harmless phrase in a letter sowed the seed of suspicion in the Shah’s mind, but whether Basidu was mentioned I have no means of telling. A sensational version of the Basidu story is that the dhow which the Mudir of Customs had been searching when arrested by the British naval guard contained arms for the Bakhtiari tribes. 12. Some say that the Shah, in anticipation of his visit to Europe fears that intrigues will begin against him directly he leaves the country, and that he is therefore eliminating one by one all the prominent personages who might engineer or focus opposition to him. But in that case it appears odd that he should tackle Asad now; there are many more serious candidates. 13. As regards conscription, it seems fairly certain from many reports that the Bakhtiari tribesmen have not yet been subjected to this. The preliminary administrative operation of the issue of £C zijill-i-ahwal” (civil registration) papers has, I understand, been completed for the Haft Lang section of the tribe, and for the remainder, the Chahar Lang, only small divisions remain unregistered; but the conscription authorities have not yet made much progress. Many of the khans are known to be opposed not only to conscription but to another project on which the Shah sets great importance—the compulsory settlement of the tribesmen in villages instead of the usual annual migrations. It is conceivable that the Shah’s dramatic action is designed to show these recalcitrant elements that the Government’s policy must be obeyed. From some travellers I learn that I a greater number of troops than usual is in the Bakhtiari area at present; so that compulsory conscription and settlement may soon begin. 14. I have also heard that a few weeks ago the Shah, who has always been anxious to make the caravan track from Ahwaz to Isfahan, known as the “ Lynch Road ” or tc Bakhtiari Road,” fit for motor traffic, suddenly ordered the Minister of Finance to find the money for putting this project into effect without delay, although the draft budget, in which no provision had been made for it, had just been completed—and balanced—with great difficulty. The tribes are alleged to have replied that £c where a carriage can pass a cannon can too.” 15. The arrest of Qawam-ul-Mulk (Ibrahim Khan Qawam), who has throughout his career been a close friend of the British, has provoked comment even among the Persians. It will be remembered that the Qawam went to Europe in 1929, at the time of the Qashqai rebellion, and that he then visited London. This visit has apparently given rise to a rumour now current in Tehran that the Qawam was induced to return to Persia on that occasion by some guarantee or promise given him by the British Government. I have found no trace of any such engagement in the archives at this Legation, and I presume that no such engage ment exists. The only explanation of the Qawam’s arrest is that since he was (by the Shah’s own order) a friend of Sardar Asad to the extent that they saw each other frequently, the Shah suspects him of being cognisant of the Bakhtiai i treason, whatever it may be. . , 16. I enclose a copy of a report which I have received from His Majesty s consul at Ahwaz upon the local effect of the Bakhtiari arrests. 17. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to the Hon. Political Resident m the Persian Gu (No. 246), and to His Maiestv’s consul at Ahwaz (No. 105).

I HAVL the honour to transmit to you, herewith, an account by His Majesty s consul at Ahwaz on a visit paid to the Bakhtiari country in Sentember 2 . Mr. Watkmson’s experiences throw some interesting light on the affair of Count di Bonzi’s article, with which I dealt in my despatch No 449 of thelMIfl^L 15th September. 1 I 1 Jr 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s consul Ahwaz^ (No. 89). ' I have, &amp;c. A U V. A. L. MALLET. ^ ,w l Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Consul Watkinson to Mr. Mallet. (Confidential.) Sir, Ramadan, October 11, 1933. WITH reference to your letter of the 26th August last, addressed to Mr. Warner, regarding present conditions in the Bakhtiari country, I have the honour to submit a report on a short visit which I recently paid to that district. As you are aware, it has been customary of recent years, when foreign visitors, consular officials or others propose to visit that country, to obtain letters of introduction to his kinsmen in Bakhtiari from Sardar Assad, the Minister of War. This has served the twofold purpose of enabling the Bakhtiari Khans to extend hospitality to visitors with less fear of after-consequences, and of allowing it to be arranged to send an Amnieh officer to accompany and watch visitors, ostensibly as a guard. These travelling facilities were recently obtained on behalf of an Italian party which visited the Bakhtiari country in August. On this occasion, when application was made to Sardar Assad for the usual facilities, I was met with a blank refusal and, as you will recollect, it was suggested that an official request should be made through the Ministry for loreign Affairs. 2. The Minister for War admitted that his action was partly due to articles which had appeared in the Iran on the 8 th September and on the 11th September, which purported to be a translation of an account published in the Berner Tageblatt on the 22nd August over the signature of Count di Bonzi, a member of the Italian expedition referred to above, together with the commen s of the editor of the Iran. M. Rahnema’s comments were outspoken and pqssi y partlv based on mistranslations, but they had created some stir m omcia circ es, and, as I was subsequently to find out, the publication of these ar ices cause considerable surprise and annoyance to the Bakhtiari Khans, w ose ospi a i } and help the Italians had enjoyed for several weeks. . .p -p • 3. According to the Iraq Times the expedition left Ita y y air p. f at the end of July, arriving in Tehran on the 1st August. I was e y Leonard di Bonzi and Professor Desio, of Milan University, accomp experienced Alpine climbers. The avowed o b i e „ ct ^/nf^VTnmit Demavend, to reach the summit of Zardek Kuh, w r est of Isfahan, an pin 7 a p north of Tehran. The Iraq Times stated that one group climbed ^arde and took topographical and altimetric measures for mappi S nffiht while a second group ascended Demavend, whm’e they were ^ September by a violent cySoJand experienced -me « J an article appeared m the Messager de 1 e Her an ,,11 j ;+ was facilities given by the Persian Government were ac' &amp; [971 f 8]2 announced that the scientific programme had been accomplished. It was further stated that mountains had been climbed which had not hitherto been scaled by Europeans. Both the mountains mentioned have of course been climbed on various occasions by Europeans—by my own predecessor amongst others—so this statement was not merely inordinately bombastic, but erroneous. 4. Unfortunately the article in the European press, which aroused the wrath of M. Rahnema, contained other observations of a nature only too liable to cause mischief. It was stated that the expedition hoped to discover a chain of mountains quite unknown till now; that no more civilised beings were met once the mountains were reached; that, although assurances had been given in official quarters that the mission need not go in fear of their lives, great numbers of rebel tribesmen were encountered (but fortunately the expedition was well armed !); that the Bakhtiari mountains are the highest in Persia and have never been explored by anyone; and, finally , according to the version in the Messager de Teheran, that the region is “ incuite et inhospitaliere,” an arena for bears and wolves, where they were exposed constantly to difficulties and dangers. After conversation with various of the khans who were in contact with the Italians, it can only be supposed that the writer relied more on the writings^of De Gobineau or on his own imagination than on his actual experiences. 5. Be this as it may, much indignation was caused and the editor of the Iran suggested that patriots should not be so enthusiastic or so hospitable in future to foreign missions and travellers, and that the identity of foreign travellers should be more closely scrutinised, and such as are likely to publish false information should not be allowed to roam about the country. 6 . It*was under these circumstances that I found Sardar Assad reluctant to have any connexion with my proposed visit to Bakhtiari. I was later informed, however, that the Shah earlier in this year told Sardar Assad that he was pleased with the work of Murteza Quli Khan, the present Ubeggi Governor, and approved of him personally, but that he had one bad habit : he was too friendly towards foreigners. The warning was passed on, and Murteza Quli Khan has told me that he thereupon wrote to His Majesty expressing astonishment and pointing out that his long connexion with Anglo-Persian Oil Company affairs is well known and that long friendships exist with the Englishmen concerned with those matters. He further pointed out to His Majesty that if British people or others came to his house he could not send them to sleep in the village. If, however, His Majesty did not wish him to entertain visitors steps had better be taken to prevent their coming to Bakhtiari. 7. As you will recollect, the Cabinet resigned at the time when discussions were going on in Tehran about facilities for my visit to Bakhtiari, and no person could be found who was able to take responsibility in so important a matter. I accordingly left for Isfahan on the 17th September, and on the following day called on the Governor-General there, to whom I explained that it had been found difficult to obtain the usual introductions from the proper persons in Tehran owing to the fall of the Government. Afshar at once sent a telegram to the Ilbeggi and informed the Amnieh authorities. He mentioned the Italian party, some of whom he had met, and himself expressed the opinion that the articles in the Iran were all that could be expected of the Tehran press and were clearly based on some misunderstanding. i* On arrival at Deh Kurd I was sumptuously entertained by the Governor ot Chahar Mahal and by the Rais-i-Amnieh of Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari, who introduced a stout and jovial lieutenant. This official was attached to my party ^ beraye ihtiram-i-jenabi-jeneral-consul.” For the next few days this indei aLigable sleuth saw to it with almost complete success that I had not one minute of private conversation with any of the khans with whom I came in contact. 9. Murteza Quli Khan, the Ilbeggi, received me with his usual friendliness a^ bhalemzar, and I stayed in his house for five days along with the Rais-i-Malieh or Bakhtiari, who has billeted himself there for an indefinite period, and my stout escort. On the day after my arrival Khan Baba Khan and Maneshir Khan, two nail-brothers of Sardar Assad, came to visit the Ilbeggi They were bidden to remain during the rest of my stay. I spent a day with Khan Baba Khan in his VV 8 .? alet at Assadieh, returning to Shalemzar at night, and also lunched with Maneshir Khan in his own village. I also visited Chigakhor, the summer camping ground, which is now deserted. The Ilkani had just left there to 'J 11 , liai missic fcfsion of ; k visited t i Isfahan w information a Company und Jthememk 12, A i milition of General ! ffl®$tance j tterfliel S ta taxes an henut the tri frhaniand]om r Assad ridi was later iili! that he was* attend to tribal affairs and to superintend the moving down of tribes fr Zardek Kuh to Garmesir; so I was unable to meet him. 10. The Italian pi ess affair was freely discussed in my presence \ letter on the subject had been received from Sardar Assad. I endeavoured to calm ^he resentment by explaining to Murteza Quli Khan and to Khan Baba Khan ^fcat as Count di Bonzi was said to be the special correspondent for the Carriere the original article may be supposed to have appeared in that journal Now the word t^ inculto ,, may equally be translated in French as “ inculte ” or “ incultive ” no matter what its German equivalent may have been in the Berne paper. Obviously the latter interpretation was intended, and is it not true of the vast open spaces of Bakhtiari ? Unhappily the Tehran press took it to refer to the inhabitants who were lacking in culture, which was of course absurd. Similarly, I tried to explain to Khan Baba Khan, who speaks French and English well, the European use of the term ‘ ‘ inhospitable ’ ’ as applied to grim mountain districts. He said that he would pass on my views to Sardar Assad. The legend of bears, wolves and brigands seems to have arisen partly from Khan Baba Khan’s own reminiscences when he entertained Count di Bonzi at Assadieh. 11. I was unable to obtain any confirmation of the suggestion that this Italian mission was other than purely sporting and scientific. The proposed diversion of the upper waters of the Ab-i-Diz was described to them when they visited the source of the Karim River. Another suggestion made to me in Isfahan was that the party contained an oil expert who was out to obtain information about the area which may be abandoned by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company under the new concession. Khan Baba Khan appeared to think that all the members of the expedition were university professors. 12. A separate memorandum is being submitted regarding the present condition of th^feakhtiari tribes. I have, &amp;c. A. E. WATKINSON. d &amp; ext te P erl TW Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Bakhtiari Tribes. General Condition .—The present condition of the Bakhtiari tribes has remained unchanged during the last two years. They are very poor and m bac circumstances, as their flocks and crops are decreasing owing to lack or mone). Neither the Central Government nor the khans give them any financial assistance, but taxes are extorted steadily. t i Revenue—TMe Rais-i-Malieh for Bakhtiari states that the annua revenue from the tribes is 32,000 tomans. Of this 18,000 tomans is handed eyei o e Ilkani and Ilbeggi Governors, who thus each receive remuneration oi 75 omans per month. In addition to this, 24,000 tomans is obtained from the J anaKi ana Khan-i-Mirza tribes. In the days when the khans collected their own axes the tribes, the annual revenue was 80,000 tomans, in addition to a ur e collected from the Chahar Eang tribes, who are now dealt with separa e Y- khans used to pay back, in the form of presents, a certain amoun o _ tribal leaders if they were in need. To-day the Central Governmen g no assistance and the khans are not in a position to do so. Ua was Migration of Tribes .—The Ilbeggi was in Tehran m u y ^ • p v received by the Shah, who asked him about present com i lons P n u ii about the movement of tribes from summer to winter d 11 ^ 1 e ^ s ,i ' tr -u should Khan expressed the opinion, as he has always done before, a settled be allowed to continue their seasonal migrations for the P rese *U „ them say in in permanent quarters until proper villages have been P re P^ , ^ ’ can ’ I1 ot ten years’ time. He told His Majesty that the tribes are s p ga ^‘ t hat he be expected to build for themselves. On this occasion an( j that agreed and that poor people should not be made to su er u ^ stopped for orders would be given that movements up and ^ ^ ^experts the present until further notice. Meanwhile, he said building could be to examine suitable building sites and to report, after which duiiqi g4 proceeded with slowly and the tribes gradually persuaded to settle down. If necessary Government financial aid would be forthcoming. Murteza Quli Khan thanked' His Majesty for making his own immediate task much easier. Building Commission.—Tv?o engineers, named Gaffari and Ansari, from the Ministry of Communications arrived recently in Bakhtiari and have been living^ with the Ilkani at Uragan, Chigakhor district. They have visited Kuh Rang ) Zardek Kuh, Chehel Cheshmeh, and other summer quarters of the Babadi and Baba Ahmed tribes. On return to Uragan they are said to have reported that it is not possible for the tribes to construct permanent quarters or to build villages in the mountains owing to climatic conditions and to lack of suitable large spaces. But possibly a few permanent buildings could be erected in certain places for those who always remain behind when winter .prigrafion begins, but not enough to house the whole of each tribe. In any case Ms recognised;that cattle and flocks will have to be removed elsewhere in the winter. They are also of the opinion that nothing can be done unless the Government provides funds. This report has not yet been sent to Tehran. After examining other mountain districts the commission is going to Malamir, Garmesir and other down-country areas to report on conditions. (A similar commission is at present at Khorremabad with representatives of Adlieh, Malieh and local military authorities, with a view to settlement of Lur tribes.) Lynch Road .—The caravan rqadTs guarded by Amnieh. All the forts built by the khans have been rebuilt or repaired. The bridges are in bad condition. There is some insecurity on the road due to Kuhgilu tribes. During August a band of robbers was causing trouble near to Deh Diz. The officer in command of Amnieh in Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari went out to Gardaneh Chat with a party of Amnieh and two robbers were killed, while two were taken prisoner and sent to Isfahan. This took place during the visit of a party of Italians to Zardek Kuh. October 1933. A. E.

November 3r3 laSS. f | Sir, With reference to my despatch No,433 of September 7th last I heve the honour to inform you that the United States Minister had an audience of the Shah last week on the eve of hi a departure for America. 2. Mr. Hart found His Majesty strikingly changed in appear ance even since he last saw him a few months ago. He described the Shah as having lost about three stone in weight and his clothes as hanging very loosely upon him. The Shah received Mr. Hart with his hat off and the Minister was able to observe how very bald His Majesty had become. 3. I regard Mr. Hart’s remarks as being of considerable Interest as he was originally a journalist by profession and has acute powers of observation. He has left Persia convinced that the Shah has not long to live, 4. Meanwhile on the other side it mist be admitted that the Shah's energy seems outwardly to be as great as ever. He has just returned from a tour of Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Xermanshah and Ramadan during which he hardly ever stayed longer than one night at one place. He has since been superintending the army manoeuvres outside Tehran and is expected to go to Mazanderan in November for the Turcoman races and later to Ahuziatan. 6.

The date of death is not indicated very precisely, but might be either October 4th or October 5th. 2, The fact that these dates are given in the press whereas it is practically certain that Teymourtaehe died on October 3rd is not entirely devoid of significance in view of the Shah’s departure for Tabriz on October 4th. 5.

WITH reference to my letter to Mr. Warner of the 26th August, I have the honour to inform you that a press campaign has been started against the Italian scientific expedition to the Zard Kuh and Kuh-i-Dinar areas of the Bakhtiari country. 2. Count de Bonzi, who is described as the correspondent of the Cornere and who is a member of this year's Davis cup team, published an article in the Berner Tageblatt announcing the progress of the expedition in which, as will be seen from the enclosed extract from the Messager de Teheran, he made many statements of a nature to infuriate the Shah.O It is, I imagine, on his specific instructions that Rahnema has opened his childish attack, since the Minister of War told Mr. Trott that His Majesty is deeply incensed at the suggestion that brigands still exist under his regime and is even contemplating the exclusion ot all tourists from Persia. Such action, if carried into effect would certain y produce a universal impression abroad that public security no longer existed anc that Persia was on the verge of revolution. „ • 3 There is no doubt that there is a considerable area of country m the neighbourhood of Kuh-i-Dinar and Zard Kuh which is extremely inaccurate^ mapped, if not unexplored.

October 6th, 1933. Sir, Abdul Hussein Khan Teymourtache died in Kasr Kajar prison on the evening of October 3rd. His death has not been made public but I fear there can be no doubt of it. For the last few weeks he has been ailing; nevertheless the Shah thought fit to keep him in the strictest solitary confinement, forbidding the occasional visits of members of his family which had formerly been allowed, and removing all furniture from his cell. Thus the man whose brilliant talents had placed him on a pinnacle of power far above all the Shah f s subjects, was left by his ungrateful master without even a bed to die upon. 2. It is difficult still to know what was the real cause of the Shah’s bitter and unrelenting hatred against his former friend, the man who had done more than all others to create modern Persia. Perhaps one day the veil will te lifted and we shall know whether feymourtache played a double game with the Soviet Government or whether the Shah s brutal cruelty to him was due to jealousy of his power and fear of usurpation at his death. 3. Rumours are of course spreading fast that Teymourtache was murdered. It is remarked that the Shah left next morning for Tabriz, but this was probably pure coincidence. Possibly the former Minister of the Court was ohe victim poisoning, more probably of disease and distress any Che Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., FOREIGN OFFICE.any case it has long been felt that he would never leave prison alive. If it is a fact, as the Shah’s doctor is said to have told a friend of his recently, that His Majesty is really suffering from cancer of the stomach, the murder theory becomes the more probable. The Shah would not wish such a dangerous enemy to survive him. 4. The analogy between present day Persia and Tudor England has often occurred to me recently, and Doctor Johnson’s lines on Cardinal Wolsey make a fitting epitaph: w To him the church, the realm, their powers consign, Thro’ him the rays of legal bounty shine, Still to new heights his restless wishes tow’r, Claim leads to claim, and pow’r advances pow’r; Till conquest unresisted ceas’d to please, And rights submitted, left him none to seize. At length his Sovereign frowns - the train of State Mark the keen glance, and watch the sign to hate. Where’er he turns he meets a stranger’s eye, His suppliants scorn him, and his followeis fly, At once is lost the pride of awful state, The golden canopy, the glitt’ring plate, The regal palace, the luxurious board, The liv’ried amy, and the menial lord, Grief aids disease, remember’d folly stings, And his last sighs reproach the faith of Kings. 5.

TEHRAN is alive with rumours that the Shah is seriously ill; and many people declare that he is suffering from cancer. 2. There is no doubt that His Majesty has twice been unwell during the last month and that Dr. Alai, the son of the late Ala-es-Saltaneh, has had to be called in. . 3. The rumours of serious illness may easily have arisen from the fact that the Shah’s intention to visit the Valiahd in Switzerland next year is now becoming widely known. People say that his real object in going to Switzerland is to consult a specialist. . 4. His Majesty has appeared in public quite recently at the opening o± a new military hospital and at a demonstration of aerial bombing, but I have not met anybody who has seen him recently at close quarters.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Cabinet of his Highness Nehdi Quli Khan Hidayat resigned on the 13th instant. It appears that the Shah, who for some time past has been known to have regarded the aged Prime Minister as too old for useful work, suddenly decided that the time had come for a change. There is also no doubt that His Majesty had expressed strong displeasure with Tagfizadeh, the Minister of Finance; the immediate cause being the Shah’s / suspicion that he had been attempting to influence a bloc of members of the Majlis to support him in a proposal for the purchase of gold. It is also supposed that His Majesty, in view of contemplated visits to Bagdad and Angora, wished to entrust the direction of the Cabinet to the one person whom he now feels he can trust for that office, viz., Feroughi. At all events Hidayat handed in the resignation of his Cabinet without consulting his Cabinet colleagues, and Feroughi was entrusted with the task of forming a new Ministry. 2. The names of the new Ministers have just been officially announced. They are as follows :— Prime Minister : His Highness Muhammad Ali Khan Feroughi. Minister for Foreign Affairs : Sayyid Baghir Khan Kazimi. Minister for War : Ja’far Quli Khan Asad. Minister of Finance : Ali Akbar Khan Davar. Minister of Roads and Communications : Ali Khan Mansur.

He was, Shah’s properties at the mouth o • Minister to Iraq and has been at however soon afterwards appointed Persian Mimste [915 dd—2] i2 Bagdad ever since. He has been engaged in discussion with the Iraqi Government on the vexed questions of the frontier and of the Shatt-el-Arab, and I imagine that his appointment to the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs may reflect the importance which His Majesty attaches to such questions. A report was current a few days ago that Kazemi was shortly to proceed to Angora m order to negotiat. ’ a new agreement with the Turkish Government; he certainly went from Bagdad to Angora a short time ago, and is either at Angora or on the road from Angora to Tehran at this moment. . , , n 5 The new Minister of the Interior, previously known as Mudir-ul-Mulk, is an old friend of this Legation, as well as a personal friend of my own. He was originally the munshi of the French Legation here, and has held various posts mnder the Pahlavi regime. In the then Sardar Sepah (now Riza Shah)’s Cabinets 'of 1923 and 1924 he was Minister of Finance; and in 1928 he was Minister of Public Works. In the following year he went to Khorassan as Governor-General, and has been employed in that capacity ever since. He is a brother-in-law of Abbas Quli Khan Nawab. 6. The new Minister of Justice is a comparatively unknown person. I learn that lie is definitely one of the old school; he was previously known as Sadr-ul- Ashraf, and has served in the Ministry of Justice and in legal appointments for many years. A sayyid and a mullah of previous days, he has been a member of the Cour de Cassation at Tehran in recent years. 7. Prince Doulatshahi has been recently acting as a kind of head Chamberlain at the Court. He succeeded in that capacity his late brother, whose title was Mujallal-ed-Howleh, the Shah’s father-in-law. It will be remembered that the latter’s sudden death after a game of cards with Abdul Hussein Khan Diba precipitated, if it did not initiate, the latter’s downfall. The new Minister’s previous title was Mishkat-ed-Dowleh; he is related to the present Governor of Tehran. 8. Ali Asghar Khan Hikmat is a graduate of the American School at Tehran. A relation of Mushar-ed-Dowleh (Nizam-ed-Din Khan Hikmat) and Sardar Fakhir (Riza Khan Hikmat), he is one of a well-known Shiraz family. He is well known to members of this Legation and has always proved himself intelligent and helpful. He was in charge of the Public Instruction department of the Ministry of Public Instruction for some years. About two years ago he was transferred to the Ministry of Justice and sent to Paris in order to pursue legal studies there. 9. Bahman, after serving for more than five years as Persian Minister at Brussels, returned to Tehran last spring and was appointed Master of Ceremonies (Foreign Section) to the Pahlavi Court. He is a pleasant little man; his activities in selling carpets at Brussels may have been a useful introduction to his present duties. 10. Bayat, previously known as Samsam-ul-Mulk, was for many years assistant to the Minister of Public Works, before that Ministry was split up in March 1930. Since then he has been unemployed. He is reported to be a capable and industrious official. 11.

The Shah’s journey only took three days as he left on the 6th August and returned on the 8th; in such a short time the interference with commerce was negligible, as hardly any traffic of a commercial nature The ostensible reason for makes use of the road yet the prohibition of traffic was, according to a notice published by the Ministry of Hoads and Communications♦ the fact that certain parts of the road were unsafe. The argument is presumably founded upon the accidental death in a motor accident of a Colonel sheibani, and while it may be true - indeed the alignment of the road over very high and difficult passes will probably mean that a certain amount of danger will always exist, and careful driving will always be necessary - the general view taken by the public seems to be that the Shah looks upon the road as peculiarly his own, leading a© it does straight to one of his properties near the mouth of tne Chalua Elver. But this view does not explain why no part of the road, not even the tlv»t forty five mXl— /are The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.G.S.I*» etc., etc*, etc., The Foreign Office*are «iif «af., wag allowed to be « 8 ad during the tine Hie Majesty was on It. 2 * ’ Hie second indication of a certain nervousness is the fact that no announcement has yet ' • pp * M&gt;ed ln th ® loeal Press of the death in prison of Saulat-ud-Dowleh, which has been reported by me separately Everybody in Tehran knows that he is dead, and this his corpse has been deposited at shah Abdul Asim pending its ultimate removal to the Holy Shrines in ’Iraq. Whether the absence of an official announcement means that he did not die a natural death (the widow, at any rate, seems to think that he was murdered), or that the effect on the Qashqai tribe will be undesirable, is uncertain. The omission seems purely stupid and, in view of the fact that the death took place at about the time of His Majesty’ absence from the capital, may perhaps be yet another instance of the failure of any Persian Government official to take any responsibility on himself.

Mallei to Sir John Simon.—(Received August 1.) Tehran,. July 14, 1933. DURING the last three months I have had much cause to reflect upon the astomshmg changes which have come to pass in Persia since I left this country m 1921. I he annual reports on Persia have fully recorded a sequence of dynastic and political changes of ever-increasing national self-consciousness and consequent relinquishment undei pressure of the secular privileges, capitulatorv, fiscal and commercial, formerly enjoyed by the European Powers in this country. Great Britain, having more to lose than other countries, except perhaps Russia, has suffered most in the process, but, generally speaking, the c ‘ faranghi,” from having been looked upon with respect tempered with dislike as a phenomenon sent as a trial by an all-seeing God to a race of true believers, has now lost his novelty and, owing mainly to the war and to the Russian revolution, sunk to the level of an ordinary mortal with human weaknesses which can be usefully exploited and sins which can be purged in Kasr Kajar. 2. All these political developments do not need recapitulation. My object in this despatch is rather to convey an idea of the rapid evolution of Persia towards Western social methods. The picture presented by Persia to-day is as different now from that of the immediate post-war period as a Cezanne from a Rubens. The subject and its underlying ideas may be similar, but the technique and method of expression has completely changed. 3. To begin with, feudalism has disappeared with the Kajars. It is true that even now an occasional scion of a noble house manages to get office, but, as one of them remarked to me recently, there are only two ‘ 1 gentlemen ’ ’ in the Cabinet now, the Prime Minister and the Minister of War, both of them nonentities. Gone are the days when Kajar Princes succeeded one another in the high positions of State; instead of the Ain-ed-Dowlehs and Farman Farmas of former times, we find Feroughi and Taghizadeh, while the Shah’s chamberlain is now one Bahman, a man who might easily be mistaken for a carpet merchant, and the President of the Majlis, his Excellency Dadgar, started life as a servant. The new dynasty has, in fact, done rather what the iudor dynasty did in England, eliminated the old aristocracy and created a new one from that lower middle class from which the Pahlavi Shah himself has risen. In ten years the power of the tribal chieftains has been broken, the tribes disarmed and then leaders brought to Tehran to grace the Pahlayi triumph; Sheikh Khaza, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, Kawam-ul-Mulk and the Bakhtiari Khans are all in le lan and may not leave the city except to visit the estates near by, whic e uc nei o them have succeeded in exchanging for the homes of their ^ ances ( J rs - ® Bakhtiaris,” said Serdar Mohtashem to me the other day, used to be great fellows for horses and women and hunting, but now oui boys are ecomi g i ^ c h a T i°„s instead.” Greetings which used to entail an elaborate and poltte pantomime of enquiry after the august health are now curt and European; the compliments which interlarded correspon e r&gt; ommanc j lacking and have been discouraged in official correspondence ^ Dignity has vanished with the abba and e foncealing the less Pahlavi hat.

Now and then a mullah ma&gt; s«U be ^^ of the priest . it is now the mere emblem of a bi gone - , l [887 a—3]hood is broken irrevocably. The Shah is supposed to be benevolently disposed towards religion in principle, but not towards its giossei maniiestations. A Royal camel is still, I am told, slaughtered on the Moslem Day of Sacrifice, because the Prophet so ordained it, but the head cutting of Moharrem and the more picturesque folklore of the Passion play, pagan superstitions, have been suppressed with a firm hand and, strangely, little protest has hitherto been heard. N Vossuk-ed-Dowleh tells me that Teymourtache was a strong supporter of the Shah in his successful assault upon the pretensions of the mujtahids, but that they would never have collapsed without a struggle had they not been most worthless creatures. Forty years ago the Shiah divines, both in Persia and Iraq, were men whose saintly lives commanded respect for their cloth, but, recently, they have been merely turbaned rascals, whose notorious mannei of limng has destioyed the respect of their flocks. Thus, in the big towns even the poorer classes are losing their faith as they seem already to have lost their fanaticism. Nine years ago the American Major Imbrie was murdered in the streets of Tehran for photographing a religious scene; to-day, one may enter mosques in Isfahan and Tehran and even take photographs there. It is true that outside the larger towns the priesthood still have great influence, and the grossest superstitions and bigotry will continue to be foisted upon the illiterate peasants until the gradual spread of education makes itself felt. Thus, recently, in a village near Qum an ignorant Sevyid, by virtue of a few lucky cures, established a reputation for miracle- working and convinced his fellow villagers that he was the twelfth Imam, on the strength of which his followers murdered a dozen or more ‘ 1 unbelievers ’ in the public bath of the village. I believe, all the same, that the decay of religion will spread from the cities to the countryside. An intelligent member of the Qaragozloo family remarked to me recently that there was a grave danger inherent in this decay of religion; nothing is taking its place save nationalism and a spurious and insolent patriotism. The way is, in fact, being paved for communism or anarchy, when the strong hand of the conquerer is eventually removed. On the other hand, it may be argued that Islam has never really been the faith of Persia; the Shiah heresy has left scope for the even wilder heresies of Sufism and Bahaism; Persians have ever been poets and philosophers rather than pillars of the faith. The trouble is, however, that in the modern rush there is no time for philosophy when engineering has to be studied, no time for poetry when Marlene Dietrich is exhibiting her incomparable legs at the Iran Cinema. The students at the German Industrial School, according to their Director, Dr. Strunck, used a few years back to be serious and keen to learn. Each year now sees a deterioration. The young men now think they know more than their teachers and are impatient of guidance. 6. The visitor to Tehran still finds delight in the eternal view of Demavend crowning the Elburz, but man has done his best to alter all but the most immovable natural landmarks. Already at Kerej the traveller has passed a large and outwardly up-to-date sugar factory and agricultural college. Outside the city gate he will see the military aerodrome; inside the city the imposing red motor watering-carts of the municipality (although he may also still notice men spraying the streets from goatskins!). The new streets are as wide as Whitehall, and some are even paved with stone blocks, but the houses on either side of them are mostly one-storied shops, here and there varied by something more imposing in two stories with Persopolitan Stucco pillars. Such parts of the older city as still remain are in the hands of the housebreaker; the Lord Mayor is a general and loves straight lines, so that the lay-out of the city will soon be as symmetrical as the modern American town. The new quarter near the Shah's new palace is certainly neat and clean and electrically lit, albeit somewhat uncertainly. There are one-way traffic and coloured light signals; horse-drawn traffic may not pass through certain streets save at dead of night; camels, those symbols of the bad old days, are rigorously excluded. Twelve years ago there was no hotel or restaurant to which a European could decently 7 go; now there are several which, while of comparatively humble design, are, I anRtold, quite habitable. Formerly, there were no places of entertainment; now there are several cinemas and night clubs where the jazz of several years ago is discoursed by Persian orchestras. Plans are afoot for a national theatre and for a museum of antiquities. Tehran is, in fact, to be a modern capital worthy of a nation which considers itself inferior to none, and the Lord Mayor, who has never travelled abroad, is said to be aiming at an improvement on Paris!3 M kni: nbeliewii ay of religii s a grafe ii no time tip , the Iraai. to their Ml learn.

To-dav a Minister of Finance can count on a steady revenue from the Anglo-Persfan 011 C T f pa f Y alone w ? r i h ten times whole revenue from all sources which accrued to the Imperial Treasury twenty-five years ago. Apart from oil revenues there are the hugely increased customs duties resultant from the complacency of the foreign Powers, who formerly insisted on a low tariff. Monopolies of wious kinds bring further sums to the exchequer; and Persia, almost unique amongst nations, has no foreign debt, unless the disputed war and post-war advances by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are to be so counted. Moreover, peculation, though still rife and inherent in the nature of the people, is more often punished and therefore perhaps practised on a less lordly scale than formerly, though Teymourtache seems to have given full rein to his natural instincts in this direction. 9. Thus from the point of view of her position in the world Persia can, 1 think, look back with satisfaction on the last twelve years. She has achieved practical independence from foreign interference and from restraints which have irked her for so long, the phantom of which still appears to haunt Reza Shah. Having got all that any sane people would want, the Persians, like the Irish, are never satisfied and are keenly on the look-out for any real or imaginary cases of lese-souverainete. Hence the constant pin-pricks inflicted on a long-suffering Diplomatic Corps. But even the most rabid manifestations of nationalism might be tolerable to foreigners living among them were it not for the additional annoyance caused by the overweening vanity of this “bandar log” amongst nations. 10. Yet actually, I suppose, there are few contented Persians to-day, except for the office-holders. The peasants are probably worse off even than in the famine years after the war; such at least is Vossuk-ed-Dowleh’s opinion. They cannot sell their produce, hampered as commerce is by the trade monopoly law; they can, of course, live on what they grow, but whereas in the past the poor man would drink for a few shahis a glass of weak tea half filled with sugar, now he can afford neither of these “ luxuries,” which are taxed about twice as highly as whisky in the United Kingdom. Of what use to tell him that instead he has motor roads, sugar factories, spinning mills, an up-to-date army and a railway in the making ? The old aristocracy loathes the new regime. The merchant-class are ruined by the world crisis, the quarrels with the Soviet and the Persian Government s economic policy. But the Shah believes in the dictum oderint dum metuant. Nobody dares to voice his complaints; the press is servile and Parliament a mere voting machine. In fact the whole nation is entirely dominated and terrorised by the single and most remarkable figure of the only great persona!it} iu Persia, Reza Shah Pahlavi. i -n noum 11. His Maiesty has built his power upon the army and will probably so maintain it as long as he lives. He is, in real fact, his own Minister of War, an he can make or unmake a general in a minute, the officers are u . zealous through a natural regard to their careers, and e men, . clothed and treated than thefr civilian friends are probably contented enough The Persian army of to-day is smart and well turned out and ^“P“ es W E appearance with that of other minor Powers; twelve years ago there were athousand gendarmes and cossacks, foreign officered, and several thousand scallywags. inst rument of the Shah’s internal policy is the police, U. ine owiei s 1 * . j disauietins:.

' it is easy to fall into the error of believing that the striking changes on which I have been reflecting are more fundamental than is really the case, fo , after all, the essential character of the Persian has not altered m this short period under review. He is still, with few exceptions, the same vainglorious, intrigum witty, untruthful, cowardly, sensual, money-loving and corrupt bemg immortalised bv Morier. He has changed his clothes, his house, his habits to meet the advance of Western ideas; he now keeps one wife, one motor car and four servants w his father kept wives, horses and servants innumerable. He has not, howev . managed to look at any question through Western eyes nor to analyse it w Western logic. This is why the task of His Majesty’s Legation m Persia mu still continue to be a thankless one and why negotiations are always so tortuou. and wearisome. In spite of its occidental veneer we are not dealing witn modern State, but with an oriental despotism. . „ , . 15.

The fullest account is to be found in the newspaper ’Iras*} its reports are still continuing, although Judgment was issued on the evening of the 35th June, the second day of the trial. 2. The trial opened on Saturday morning, the 24th June, in the Criminal Court for Government Servants, under the presidency of Mlrza Abdul All Khan Lutfi Larijani. The two accused were present in person, aecoi^anied by their advocates; for Teymourtache, Mirsa Ahmad Khan Muqbil, and for Amin, three well known lawyers (one of them being the former Armenian deputy. Or. Aghayan). -me record etatea that Teymourtaehe gave hia name as simply Abdul Hussein Teymourtaohe, and declared hi. afe a. fifty. When ashed what his occupation was, he replied 'Hone*. When pressed to give some occupation he replied that he was previously In Qovermment service. As for his domicile, he gave it as ’In prison*. iHke accusation had been carefully prepared /and The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, 0 .G*S.Is, eteu , etc* , etc©, The Foreign Office#■C i iw li ' 3 300 &lt; 500.000. mjL '^OQiOQQi and took a long time to read. Teymourteehe was eecused of aceepting from Amin a tribe amounting to nine thousand pounds, and two hundred thousand Rials, and of defrauding the Government of a like amount. Ha^i Amin was aeoused oi giving the above-*mentioned sums as bribes to a Government servant contrary to the law forbidding bribery of government servants; of committing a breach of trust towards the government, and of embezzlement of a sum of three hundred thousand Blais the property of the Opium Concession as a whole. 4« After both accused had pleaded not guilty, some preliminary fencing took place with Teymourtache. He explained to the president of the Tribunal that he had received the sums mentioned in the accusation as a loan; the coneessionnaire had gained a large sum from his monopoly of export, and from this sum he allowed Teymourtaehe to draw an advance. ’When as3.eed whether he naci given a i©ceipt, he replied that the amounts were paid to him by cheque or by bills of exchange, which could be produced with his signature tuereon as pr.of of receipt. men asied whether there was any arrangement as to interest, lit raplica tihntr ef inters ho replied that the question of interest was to he settled when the loan was repaid. Aain, however, said that he understood that the payment w.. made for the account of the Government. Teymourtaehe strenuously denied this, pointing out that if the payment had been made for the Government it would have gone to the Ministry of Finance. 6&gt; public prosecutor, Sururi, made a long 1. .upport of «» the financial operations in the course of which the suns of nine thousand pound, and two hundred thousand Rials were paid over are eomplieated and I will not ym /with ,5 J3 «• &gt;. 000 . 1^8 9,» ,000 t .iTT^L :Uo p 100,000, wltii a 1^11 statement tne public prosecutor * s version of them* Briefly, they amount to this; that soon after the concession was granted in October, 1930, the Government, through Teyacmrteche, informed Amin that they required one hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of eachange at the rate of six Tomans to the Pound, As the Pound had then risen to nine Tomans, Amin stated that such an operation was impossible; the demand was then reduced to fifty thousand Pounds# and certain other adjustments were made whereby, in the end, no exchange was actually sold at all, but a certificate stating that it had been sold was given, and certain sums were paid over by Amin to Teymonrt&amp;che, 6, The speeches of the various counsel developed the various arguments and established the fact that Teymourtaehe certainly did receive the sums mentioned* On the second day of the trial Teymourtache was asked if he had anything to say, and made a long speech. He took the public prosecutor’s points one by one and triea to snow that the evidence advanced did not prove the second charge of fraud. It was not true that he wae the omnipotent power m the country. Of courts* he had authority, hut it was only in the execution of hia duty under the twperyision of Hie Majesty, who alone possessed any rBa ' 1 (Teymourfh.) m «*« &lt;* » *•* Hlae of his family to naintaln abroad and educate.

At the end of his speech the President of the Tribunal asked him whether he had anything further to say, and he replied that he had forgotten one or two matters; the court gave him leave to mention them later. Ho report of these further remarks has yet appeared in the ’ifean*, but from other reports I gather that Teymourtache dealt with the genesis of the ©plum concession: he stressed the point that he was on bad terms with the Minister of finance and therefore could not be said to have interfered in the latter’s business. The remainder of his remarks was concerned with laudatory references to the Shah and to an appeal for justice ana mercy. *Tht first judgement ruined me - I cannot be ruined any mores but let not my family suffer 1 . fh® judgment of the court, pronounced et a p.B». on the 36th June, the second day of the trial, was printed in the mast prominent part of the Iran ol tne 26th June.

I have the honour to report that Mlrza Yahya Khan Oaragosslou resigned (or was allowed to resign) the post of Minister of Education on the 6th instant. It has been known for so®© time that he had heen hoping for a diplomatic post abroad: in August last it was announced that he had been appointed Persian Minister in Paris. The announcement was subsequently found to be inaccurate and Mirza Yahya Khan continued at his post. To judge from certain remarks of Monsieur Godard, the French Director of Antiquities, it has lately become more and more difficult to persuade His Excellency to take any decision involving any res onsibility. As for the reason for His Excellency's resignation, the ex-Minister ! s own explanation is illness. He has been in charge o the Ministry, an arduous, exacting and worrying post, sine© January 1928, and may therefore very naturally be longing for a change. It eeeas proUafcle however that hie own pusillanimity was the real reason for his retirement. The story current in local gossip is that during recent examinations a number of vociferous students complained to the Shah that they had been unfairly examined, with the result that His Majesty sent for Hla Excellency, and, in language more appropriate to the barrack square than to the court, roundly abused him and told him that he must go. S. Doctor Ahmad Khan Muhsini (Xmad-ul-Mulk), hitherto Director of the Department of , ublic Instruction in Azerbaijan, is The Right Honourable, Sir John Simon G.G.3.I., etc., etc., etc*, FOREIGN OFFICE.&amp;• is snnouBced a© His Excellency’s successor, though merely a 'gijrant' Of the Minister. Doctor Ahmed Khan is not personally known to any member of His Majesty’s Legation but he is said to have studied under Professor Browne in Cambridge* 3. Mir ©a Yahya was one of the senior members of the present Cabinet, In point of view of uninterrupted service* Three Ministers only can claim a longer period: viz., the aged Mehdi Quli Khan Hidayat, Jaafar Quli As 1 ad and All Akber Khan Davar, who have all been continuously employed since June 1927. The last-named is the only one who appears to have any real say in the affairs for which he is nominally responsible, and it is remarkable that he has been clever enough to hold his place so long. As for As*ad and the Prime Minister, there seem® no reason why they should not go on until they die. A®’ad’s functions are mainly confined to accompanying the Shah on his journeys, and the octogenarian Prime Minister has only to attend Cabinet meetings three times a week and sign his name in the proper places. He contrives to while away the rest of his time in his garden at Darrus, with the help of a musician playing the tar and a new ’’sigheh’ 1 or temporary wife, the seventeen year old daughter of his gardener.

Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received November 22.) (No. 458.) k 11 ' 5 . Tehran, November 3, 1932. 1 HA V E tne nonom to transmit to you herewith an account taken from the Messager de Teheran of an address given recently by the Shah at one of his periodical receptions of members of the Majlis. The accounts in the Persian press are on similar lines and no fuller. 2. The address foreshadows the creation of a National party exclusively devoted to the good of the country, and it is popularly supposed that this party will be organised on “ Fascist ” lines. 3. It may be recalled that an earlier attempt to found a party of this kind, the Iran No, came to nothing (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 409 of the 9th August, 1927, and the annual report for 1927) ; the immediate object of the founders of that party was to inspire Persian parliamentary life with some degree of patriotism and discipline, and that object has on the whole been achieved in the Taraqqi party, the Iran No’s spiritual successor. 4. His Imperial Majesty must, therefore, presumably be aiming at some thing more profound than the mere creation of a machine to keep the Majlis in subservience. It remains to be seen whether or not it is beyond the power of the Shah and Teymourtache to instil into the population at large some of the ideas of duty and responsibility that are being painfully instilled into the official and military classes, and to inculcate the lesson that though the first rule of patriotism, as understood in Persia, may be to oust the foreigner, the second must be to do the foreigner’s work as well as he did it. This is a formidable undertaking rendered the more so by the steadily growing discontent, oi which the recent developments at Tabriz, on which I am reporting in a separate despatch, are a disquieting symptom, and circumstances are likely to be too strong, even for the Shah and his Minister of Court. 5.

[E 1878/47/34] No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received Avril 11) (No. 130.) ^ r ’ T ttattt- xi r Tehran, March 25, 1933. , . DAVE tne honour to report that the Shah opened the ninth Majlis on the 15th instant at 10 a.m. This ceremony had been fixed for His Majesty’s birthday, and the proceedings were, I understand, on a more elaborate scale than usual. It was attended by the Cabinet, ex-Prime Ministers, a few of the principal Ulema, the Diplomatic Corps, the Under-Secretaries of State, certain notables, and a posse almost a platoon—of the senior officers of the army. In accordance with his established practice, His Majesty read his speech in a halting manner, and in a voice so low that none of the Persian scholars in the diplomatic box could understand a word. 2. A translation of the speech is enclosed herewith. So far as internal affairs are concerned, it is evident that the Shah is determined to continue the policy of industrialisation which is proving a severe drain on the country’s scanty resources: The intention to divide all Crown lands “ among those classes which lack a stable system of living ” was rather a surprise. From recent reports by His Majesty’s consul at Seistan I have learnt that certain lands in that area (all of which is technically Crown property) have been allotted to small cultivators; and it has been known for some time past that certain troublesome tribesmen, particularly Lurs, have been forcibly transferred from their ancestral domains and made to live in other parts of Persia. Presumably, it is proposed in future to settle still more of them on Crown lands. The details of the scheme will no doubt be set forth in the legislation which the speech foreshadows. I imagine that the truth of the matter is that the large estates which form the Crown domains of Persia are found to bring in very little net revenue, the expenses of Government management being nearly as much as the income. The Government may therefore hope that under private ownership the land taxes which will be collected from the peasant proprietors working on their own land will increase the revenue of the exchequer. If this proved to be the case of policy, three excellent results would be attained : Large numbers of a population which must be highly dissatisfied would be propitiated; the agricultural wealth of the coun ly would be increased; and, most important of all, the revenue would be augmen e . 3. The reference to the oil dispute is satisfactory so far as it goes, the moie so that there is no expression of a similar hope that the yet more serious i cu &gt; with the Soviet Government “ will terminate m desirable results under equitable arrangements^ ^ the Shah enquired of the Ulema who were grouped on his right hand (the ex-Pnme Ministers being on his left), why the Imam Jum’eh of Khoi was not present. The plea of ill-health was accepted as adequate and His Majesty withdrew. oarllv drcarv 5. So far as the Diplomatic Corps was concerned it was a sadly dreary ceremony.

Speech delivered by His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah Pahlavi on the Occasion of the State Opening of the Ninth Term of the Majlis, on Esfand 24, 1311 (March 15, 1933). (Translation.) In the Name of God the Exalted! WE open with the utmost pleasure the ninth legislative term of the National Consultative Assembly. Thanks to God, the general situation in the country is calm, and our relations with foreign countries are preserved and established on the basis of sincere friendship and reciprocal respect. Our Government is in duty bound in the meanwhile to safeguard (even) more than heretofore the interest of the country in respect of its foreign policy. As we have intimated in our Speech opening the eighth term, the amelioration of economic affairs therein foreshadowed has received attention, and laws have been enacted and enforced in view of the need for the balancing of commercial dealings. In view of the importance of commerce we have urged our Government to exert special vigilance in the complete preservation and enforcement of the said laws. With regard to the advantages of stimulating interest on the part ot the public towards agriculture and the extension of cultivation in the country, \ 18 essential that the Crown lands of the Government in all parts of the country s ouid be divided among those classes which lack a stable system of living. The Government should therefore prepare the necessary Bills for the realisation of this purpose and have them sanctioned by the Majlis. •Ji 18 our aspiration that the requirements of the country should, as far as In in G ’ 6 ,^ ce&lt; ^ country and by the people themselves. With reference Auglo-Persian Oil Company Concession and the that thp «f S W 1&lt;? p aie r?

IN despatch No 124 I have referred incidentally to the result of the trial of the ex-Mmister of Court Teymourtache. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a newspaper report of the trial and the sentence. 2. The section of the Criminal Code under which it was decided to hold the case in camera was No. 327; a translation is as follows The examination and investigation of the court must be public, subject to the following exceptions : {a) in offences connected with chastity; (&amp;) in matters of filthy behaviour and in offences contrary to good morals; (c) in conduct contrary to the feelings of religion; and {d) in circumstances in which a public session of the court would be prejudicial to the security and to the good order of the State. The court will issue directions for a secret trial after the Public Prosecutor has declared his opinion.” 3. The sentences appear to be severe, judging from the accusations in the light of current practice. I understand that the maximum penalty for “ false pretences ’ ’ is two years; and for bribery the usual sentence is not more than six months. The sentence of three years’ solitary imprisonment, being a more severe form of penalty than the two years’ correctional imprisonment, prevails over the latter, so that the two periods will run concurrently and not consecutively. 4. I have mentioned the opinion of Mirza Ahmed Khan Shari’at-zadeh as to the baselessness of the charges. The lawyer stated to Mr. Trott that he was forced to withdraw from the defence. The newspaper account states that he refused to defend the accused. It is probable that public rumour is correct in saying that Teymourtache asked for Shari’at-zadeh to defend him, but, when informed that Shari’at-zadeh could not do so, said: “All right, then, I don’t mind whom you appoint to defend me—it makes no difference.” 5. As for the details of the trial, I suppose they will never be published, at any rate by this regime. Two stories are current concerning Teymourtache s own defence. One says that he just refused to make any detailed reply to the charges, saying that he knew it would be useless; the other says that he made a long and clever speech, criticising the provision of the Persian Criminal Code which says that in trials of Government servants the Minister of Justice has the right of supervision and intervention. I suppose that the former story is the more probable. . . ^ 6. As for the cryptic words of the judgment concerning the bripe^ “ apparently valued at 20,000 tomans, but sold for 8,000 tomans, which nobody seems to understand, Shari’at-zadeh’s story is that this refers o e sa e y Teymourtaohe of certain shares which he held m the Revir Khounan Company (which develops the Samnan Oil-field) ; the accused is supposed to have sold a block of these shares at a value greater than the true market rate. 7. The prisoner has, according to the law, a right ° f f a PP® al AA “Tamiz” or High Court within ten days of communication of the sentence. The fact that, as far as I can discover, he has not yet availed himself o right leads me to think that he knows it would be &lt;I ulte T u ® e _ ie f' I have. &amp;c. R. H.

On the internal situation generally and the 3hah* s attitude regarding various issues in Persia, reference may he made to Tehran despatch No.80 of 25th February on P.Z. 1575. It will he remembered that commercial relations with the ooviet are at the moment very strained and that the Soviet have closed the northern frontier. Mr. Hoare's despatch of 25th February gives the impression, however, that the Minister is to a large extent guessing as to the real motives behind the Shah’s general policy, what does definitely appear from the correspondence we receive is that tne Shah is in complete charge ana that there is no one in his entourage who is able or willing to atana up to him. His policy of striking off the heads of the tallest popples has removed for the present, far as can he juagea, any danger of a military upri b in b , ana the last seven years have seen the removal of an the former major chieft&lt; , past have been in a posit Government. ains who in the ion to threaten the Central A S . nHO. 100, Sir, 1863 last I ha on February 25th the 'fa^adaud 1 published a curious report about the trial of the ex-Minister of Court. The newspaper stated that It was inaccurate to say that Teymourtache had been examined and interrogated by a Juge d*Instruction with a view to his trial; 'The Parquet has hitherto only been examining matters connected with the affair; and Doctor Lindenblatt has also been the subject of legal investigations'. 2. On March 8th the 'Iran' published a statement that the trial would take place before the Criminal Court for the examination of Government servants* A formal accusation against him had been deposited with the Court by the public prosecutor, the charges being those of bribery (presumably accepting bribe® is meant), embeEzleaaent and fraud; the total suit claimed fro.® him being one thousand eight hundred pounds and more than one million rials. 3, n»he 'Tajaddud' of the sane day published an article as follows J- At 10*30 a*®, today Abdul Hussein Khan Teymourtahhe attended the Court (First Section) of Criainal •: oct? ure against Government officinls xauier the euper-vieion of officials in order to go through the dossier of his case and appoint and introduce his lawyer to the court.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) R.H. HOARS,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA CONFIDENTIAL [E 1234/17/34 March 7. 1933 Section 1. No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 7 ) (No. 70.) Sir, Tehran, February 20, 1933. AS I have reported by telegram, His Imperial Majesty the Shah received me yesterday morning, in order that Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd might take his leave of His Majesty on the termination of his appointment as military attache to this Legation. The Shah, with good-humoured earnestness, expressed the hope that Colonel Dodd would resume normal military duties, indicating that, in his experience, true happiness was only to be found in the ranks of the army. Colonel Dodd replied suitably, and the Shah wished him good-bye, saying that in wishing him all prosperity, his good wishes included the British army. 2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who interpreted, had told me that His Majesty wished to have a talk with me, and tea and cigarettes were then brought in. 3. His Majesty began the conversation a little unsuccessfully by suggesting that this was my first winter here. We then compared this winter with last, and I hazarded the suggestion that the mildness of this winter was responsible for the epidemic of influenza; I was glad to think that His Majesty had quite recovered from his attack. His Majesty’s health and the mention of wintei served as an introduction to an enquiry after the Valiahd and whether he was keen on winter sports. His Majesty’s reply was to the effect that he was afiaic that he was too keen and might damage himself skiing. And this led nie to aeroplanes via Mr. Buckingham, who is now here, having delivei ed the igei Moth aeroplanes recently acquired by the Persian Government, an w o is a first-rate performer on skis. His Majesty said that he was veiy pease wi these machines, and mentioned the loss of one through the incompetence of the pilot, and suggested that it would be a good advertisement oi ^e compai &gt; replace it. I replied that I would repeat his words to Mr. Buckingham expiessed my gratification at His Majesty’s satisfaction with the machines said that oui experts were fully convinced that British machines 'p 16 e , , account and mentioned the great flight to South Africa. His i ajes \ f of the flight, and quite agreed about the supremacy of our aeroplanes^ 4. At this point I formed the impression that His h Sh T Cadman me to talk business, and I mentioned the impending , tw-h had reported and his collaborators for Tehran. His Majesty lep ie , satisfactory this, and that he hoped Sir John would be If '^^fLle the Welfare of the settlement. He quite understood that at interests that both shareholders at heart, but he felt that, ^ on y . directors should the British and Persian Governments haa in the coi^cerm the directors^ ^ not regard it as a simple money-maKing business _ - v i ew but he feared that hoped that His Majesty’s Government f? 0 ' , j p ers i a and did not share they were not animated by friendly feelin p g furnished by the attitude his' desire for good relations, of which evidence was of the and conduct of the Persian G °'' ern ™® n ^ L Persian Government pressed concession. I suggested, in iepl}. th embark on negotiations, they the company to send a mission here last S P ^ a w} Ji e; the obvious had no idea how grave a crisis thiea .® ne ( rnieg t0 determine measures to save and urgent need was for the iendmg oi I g erafcioll to compare the action the industry from collapse. It was ^ thev required the company to send of the Persian Government last spm^when^thejjeq^ ^ ^ ^ h representatives here m order to house already on fire, wished his relations, with that of a landlord ^ ^ manne r in which he paid his tenant to start talking about detai s &lt; i their views on the subject of Persia, rent. As for His Majesty’s Government and then [747 g-1]they were unchanged. Their interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, their e to see the world settle down and prosper, and every other possible consideration must convince His Majesty that there was no deliberate hostility, r wondered whether his impression that the policy of His Majesty s Government was hostile to Persia was not the result of attaching undue importance to what he had read in the press. This question was not fully understood, and it was necessary to explain that I meant the adverse criticism of the Persian Govern ment which appeared in the foreign press subsequent to the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession. His Majesty replied that he did not attach great importance to press polemics in general, and none at all to scurrilous peisonal attacks to which persons who had acquired some measure of prominence were always exposed But he felt that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government was not a just one. He also felt that the entire financial loss resulting from the world crisis should not fall on one party only, but should be fairly distributed As I had used a simile, he would, too, and say that Persia was a man on the verge of suffocation, and His Majesty’s Government apparently objected to his fighting for breath. 5. I replied that His Majesty was entitled to hold this view, but I thought he must admit that His Majesty’s Government were fully justified in regarding the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession as an attack on our rights which we had to resist. I said this a little aggressively, rather expecting it to be ill- received. Feroughi may, of course, have toned it down, but, anyhow, the Shah answered quite amicably that we were entitled to defend our interests. 6. At this point I concluded that the Shah had had enough, and I therefore asked Feroughi to say again that the desire of my Government was to see a prosperous and stable Persia. His Majesty explained that a Persia, master in her own house, with a patriotic Government sufficiently strong to run an independent foreign policy, should be one of our political goals, but he greatly feared that this was not the case, and that we resented all manifestations of independence. 7. I assured His Majesty that almost all of what he had just said would have been quite suitable for inclusion in a speech by you on Anglo-Persian relations, but that his conclusion was quite wrong. 8. It would be interesting to know how Feroughi put this into Persian. ( p to a point the Shah listened with the impassivity which I imagine he has cultivated, and then started, and ejaculated an angry “ what? ” Feroughi made a second attempt, this time with entire success, as the Shah laughed with every appearance of real good humour. Shortly afterwards he terminated the audience. 9. On reconstructing the conversation, I notice that I failed to take up the pomt made by the Shah that “ the entire loss should not fall on one party only.” mt he should have said this makes it, I think, abundantly clear that he believes • ec me . 111 P ers ian royalty to have been out of all proportion to the decline in ttie receipts of the shareholders and in the income tax received by His Majesty’s qvernment and it now seems to me possible that a slightly childish sense of '!!S ln ! ai , r y t r l ’ eate&lt; ^ 1 as . we il as actual anger at the smallness of the royalty, (•Gnr.Aiiof ‘ W at J® roil g hl i n the course of the audience called the “ geste ” of i n 1 nr ^ remarks also suggested that the company was unfair.

HOARE. ^?‘TA'a e i )mai ?u ^ nten ^ e ^ t0 seilc * despatch by the hand of Colonel Dodd on the 20th February, but a sudden indisposition prevented him from leaving. My telegram Iso. 44 of to day s date contains a record of m y conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the audience and the Shahs general outlook, heroughi confirmed my impression that suspiciousness of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s past conduct, which had been greatly increased by his growing mistrust of Teymourtache, was almost certainly the reason for his sudden irruption into the arena and his order for the cancellation of the concession. Feroughi a]so agreed that the conflict between Teymourtache and the Minister of Finance had probably played a part, in that a natural result of it would have been that the Shah was less well-informed of the facts than usual—perhaps I should say even than usual. But if we are to accept as truthful the astounding confessions of ignorance made by Davar in the course of the conferences with representatives of the company in Paris (Mr. Jacks gave me the records to read this morning), we are led not so much to wonder at the Shah’s ignorance and suspicions, but to ask ourselves whether Teymourtache. in spit of his apparently extensive knowledge of the company’s affairs, had any real understanding of them. Again, in my conversation with Feroughi, I mentioned the opinion by Messrs. Lumley and Lumley annexed to the Persian statement to the Council of the League. Feroughi’s demeanour suggested that this was the first he had heard of this opinion, and it is to my mind quite doubtful whether he has read the Persian statement. Finally, the fear of the Shah is now, as Davar plainly said in Paris, so great that his advisers, “ falsely so-called,' would not dare, even if they had the knowledge, to attempt to clear the atmosphere. And that is why I think we must face the task if the negotiations are to have a reasonable prospect of success. In conclusion, I venture to express my entire agreement with the view of the company, as conveyed to me in your telegram No. 30 of the 18th February, that the visit to Tehran is sound tactics if we believe that a further reference to M. Benes or the League of Nations will be necessary. When I suggested that the visit should not take place, it was with my eye on the negotiations rather than on the possibility of their being abortive, remembering that President Wilson was gravely handicapped at Versailles by not being able to refer the point to his Government.” ^ TT TT R.

Sir, 1923 ciremstances an« future fate of Teymourtaeke Imu feeen partially lifted by recent announcements in Tehran newspapers. The newspaper ’Tajaddud-i-Iran* on the 11th February announced that the preliminary investigations into the offences of the ex-Minister of Court had been completed and that hi® trial would take place shortly. The*Iran f of the 30th February stated that he had been arrested and taken to the Police prison. The *Paiaddud- i-Iran’ of the next day, however, was more explicit. It said that as the result of the investigations of the ’dug® d*Instruction 1 , of the Secret Police, and of the criminal court, Teymourtache had been transferred from his residence to the Q&amp;sr-i-Qajar prison on the 16th February. Owing to heart attacks h. had forthwith been admitted to the hospita of that institution where he was being treated. The accusations against the prisoner were partly connected wid his interference with the affairs of the Mational Bank end with his irregular operations in the foreign exchange b. 200»OOP« that claims against the The Eight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I-» etc., etc., etc.,,'+-&lt; 2 j p.. 19.000. firmej and we learn that property of the accused to the value of nineteen thousand Tomans has been sequestered In connection with his debt to the Pahlevl Bank. w At any rate there is, for the present, ao talk of charges of treason, such as the acceptance of bribes from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company or the Soviet Kmbassy, with which public gossip has been much occupied. Such charges would probably have been tried by a military court. 2. I learnt from the Minister of far, Jaafar t h Quli Ac*ad, on the 18th February that the Shah had decided to punish the ex-Minister of Court to toe full; and that all As*ad*s efforts to delay the trial on the grounds that It was doubtful before what court the accused could be tried had been of no avail (the difficulty about his being a Minister and so amenable only to the High Court of Appeal - which tried Firuz Mirza - has been surmounted by a decision that a Minister of Court is an official and not a resoonsible Minister). I imagine that His excellency himself, as a well-known friend of the prisoner, feels none too safe froa the royal wrath and therefore has not yentnred to go very far with Mis Majesty; hut I believe he has done ^ ** ' his best. fhe newspaper report that the public Pro.eoutor proeeeded on the 21st Febmary to e*a»in. the books of the national Bank is hardly compatible wit fact, which everybody has known for a long tine, that Teymourtache's dealings with the Bank have been under thorough examination since he was placed under arrest, and + h » very beginning of the National Bank Indded that, from toe *•- .&gt; g made by the investigators scandal, great efforts have been made oy . h i« It appears that the Shah to establish a case again . * full rigour of criminal procedure *»• ordered that the full rig /stlould /** 1$ mm should he enforced against his former favourite. The Minister of War's belief, according to what he told Mr. Jacks some little time ago, is that what caused the present turn of events was the article which appeared in the * Times 1 of the 9th January 'from a correspondent recently in Persia*. This article stated that the Shah was some years over sixty (he i® actually fifty eight) f *which is equivalent to seventy five In Western countries'* and in poor healths in consequence, the prospect of a Regency occupied his mind - w What chance would his thirteen year old son have, should the Regency fall to a man still young, ambitious and entirely unscrupulous*? The safety of the dynasty can be ensured only by removing all men of outstanding ability and the substitution of less striking and less independent figures such ae the present Minister for Foreign Affairs'. About a fortnight ago there were persistent reports that the Shah had decided to pardon Teyaourtach# and exile hi* to his .1 estates in Khorasaah. Sons said that thisjras the reeult of an appeal made to his father hy the ValiM*, who is at school with Teyaourtache’s son in Switzerland. But the reports ceased suddenly, and it seems to me exceedingly probable that the Times article worked the change, though whether because the Shah’s suspicious nature found in it « _&lt; -An* ar because he was enraged the authentic voice of wisdom, or oecs . . «„•- ami at the doubts expressed at the allusions to his age and o»..“ *“ “ iuw -vr;:; carry on without Teymourtaehe.

He appeared at the utmost to hope, by mobilising the coraeraial community and the press, to obtain fro* the aoviet Government better treatment for the Persian exporter, we may be certain that the attach launched by Teymourtaehe has been continued and intensified under direct orders fro* the Shall. That being so, there is reason to fear that it will be continued by his Ministers until further orders regardless of the prospects of success, which, spewing as a layman, I regard as poor* 3&gt; ^ the face of things, the Shah has The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.G.3.I.# etc*, etc*.

Teymourtachs, if he were free to speak. Bight well say with Prince Bulow that only statesmen, who understand how to handle a crisis, should provoke one. And yet 1 see no reason to believe that the shah is not still capable of appreciating the dangers involved and I as? Inclined to conclude that in facing these dangers he lias done so as a mean© of preventing yet more undesirable developments* I have nothing definite to go on, but the impression of which X gave an indication in ay despatch Mo.

I® it possible test the Shah has had a severe fright and that the -Soviet Intelligence Service-, which formed the subject of *y deepatch Ho. 390 of s. p t*bar 10th, and previous despatches, was a mors _ „ „„ told ,t the time'?

Hoar p to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 14.) (No. 36.) . Tehran, January 28, 1933. 1 HAVE reported in my despatch No. 34 of the 28th January the dithyrambic references to the Shah in speeches pronounced by the Prime Minister and members of the Majlis at the final session. They go a considerable way in sycophancy, but at least they contain some sense of proportion, in that the usefulness of the 4 ‘ hand ” to the ‘ £ eye ’ is recognised. The press, on the other hand, as will be seen from my despatch No. 32 of the 28th January, goes much further, and the sum and substance of the matter, which has no doubt been true for some time past, but had hitherto been decently veiled, is that nothing has any existence in this country but for the grace of the creative will of the supreme mind, and no man has any personality or authority but by the Imperial inspiration. In fact, the Lord he is God. 2. It appears to me not altogether far-fetched, on the strength of a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd January, to say that the extravagant tone of the press is a direct reflection of the Shah’s mood to-day. I leave the facts to speak for themselves. I told Feroughi that I understood, though I had not seen a translation of the article, that Seyyid Naficy, the author of a series of articles about Bahrein which appeared last summer, had just produced in the Skafaq-i-Surkh a quite outrageous attack on the British race, on the British character and on British characteristics in general. Feroughi had not seen the article, but said that it had been mentioned to him; Naficy was rather a turbulent fellow and ambitious and wanted to become a Deputy. It was a pity that the press indulged m vulgai abuse and was unable to distinguish between legitimate polemics and meie vituperation. But, of course, his Highness continued without a smile or tremor, there was no censorship, and I must believe that every polemic or abus 1Y e article which appeared in the press had not, before its appearance appioval of the Government. I conveyed to his Highness quite politely ^ we h ^d h « a ‘“ * hi &gt; ***“”“ of a P 081 * 1 ^^: then went on t0 say that much of the criticism °f P “ e SI ^J 11 ‘; h was now appearing revealed a deplorable the“ fork' tooth: This afforded me the opening which I wanted for alludi gt th t pick and poker ” article referred to m Sir F.

Unfortunately. Teymonrtaehe has lacked some of the purely moral factors which made the strength or the youthful Dav.d. some 01 P . fo the , ess cara paign, until this moment I had not been privileged to realise the extravagances of which it is capable; in fact, between October 1931 when I arrived, and the middle of November last. British policy, virtues or vices were hardly mentioned at all except for a short outburst when the Anwlo-Persian Oil Company report appeared and when a correspondent of the Mornina Pont referred regretfully to missed opportunities (see my despatches No. 322 of'the 15th July, 1932, and No. 362 of the 24th August respectively). On both occasions I indicated my dissatisfaction, and on both occasions the campaign was dropped before it became necessary to consider whether more serious notice should, or should not, be taken of the matter. There seemed to he no doubt that both campaigns were directed by Teymourtache, just as it may be taken for certain that the long series of articles in the Shafaq-i-Surkh on the subject of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession were written by him. It was not certainly first-class stuff, but, if we compare it with specimens of what the Persian journalist produces without Feymourtache to hold his hand, but haunted by fear of the Imperial wrath, there is reason to view the eclipse of Teymourtache with at least intellectual regret. 7. I will conclude by once again referring to the ugly suspiciousness which Teymourtache once discussed with Sir R. Clive (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 121 of the 19th March, 1930). Because there had been a few sympathetic references to his downfall in the British press, Teymourtache was in British pay, and Ansari has been moved from London because he had taken money from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 8 . I should add that I have made no serious attempt to check the present campaign, because, until it is clear how the situation develops at Geneva, it seems imprudent to discourage the Persian press from providing sticks for the chastisement of their Government before a League Commission of Conciliation. 9.

The Foreign Office, in their telegrams of 23rd February, No.32 and 25 th February, No. 33 , have indicated the grave objections which they see (and which are patent) to any proposal to volunteer the statement at this stage. The Shah’s attitude at the audience and the attitude of the Government generally do not suggest that our course would be advanced by the adoption of either an unduly riendly or of an apologetic attitude.

I wondered whether he had at the time of cancellation any idea of immediately preceding events which I recited to Minister for Foreign Affairs who re plied though he could not speak with certainty as he was not here, my account made him think that the Shah could nothave been properly informed, making it pj-umn his opinion the Shah alone was responsible for the can- cellation* .

Sir, v 14 FEB I&amp;33 In ray despatch Ho« 392 ot the 10th September, 1932, I had the honour to report that arrangements were being made to hold elections throughout the countryfor the ninth terra of the Majlis. X now have to report that the eighth terra of the Majlis, which was initiated by the Shah on the 16 th Bee ember, 1930, came to an end on the 15th January, 1933. 2* The last session took place at 11.15 p.m. on the night of the 14th January. The President, His Highness Mir8* Hussein Khan Badgar, opened the proceedings with a speech in which he said that the eighth Majlis had been able to fulfil conscientiously and quietly its functions owing entirely to the wisdom and firmness ol Hi© imperial Majesty the Shah. The speaker recalled that in former legislatures, in spite of the excellent intentions of the deputies, the lack of centralisation and of security in the country had rendered all their good intentions useless. Sow, however, all was different. s&lt; airsa Khalil Khan Pahlai then eulogiaed the President for hie self-denial, hie eala te^er, and his impartiality: and went on to allude to the happy results obtained and reforms realised under the aegis 4 .

He continued hy remarking that the Manila and the government had worked together in 'perfect agreement, so that it was impossible to separate the two or to draw distinctions between them; Just as a comparison between the eye and the hand of the body was out of place. 4. The Prime Minister, His Highness Mehdi Quli Khan Hidayat, wound up the debate. He developed the idea of the unity of hand and eye, saying that each was useless without the other. What was the spirit which was guiding them today in Persia? Unquestionably they owed everything to Miza Shah pahlavi. They must work energetically and attentively; but even then they would be far from realising all tne beneficient projecte which that august sovereign had conceived for the benefit of Persia. Whatever they had done hitherto was not enough. The Shah 1 a desire for progress required constant and unremitting effort. It was a matter for great satisfaction that all the laws which had been voted had been scrupulously put into force? though the same could not have beea saxa for previous legislatures. His Highness in conclusion expressed the hope that the ’eye and hand’, working in complete harmony, would be able to fulfil with success the duties which they had assumed in the service of the spirit which animated them. &amp; in spite of the hopes expressed in August, „ . ha _ not yet met.

Kumomr# of oabinet reconstruction have been rife ever since the beginning of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute. Hirsa ilassan Khan Pirnia (l&amp;shir ud Douleh), his brother Mirza Hussein Khan Pirnia (Mu'tamin ul Hulk), and Mlrtft Hass&amp;n iChan Vossuq. (Yossuq ud bouleh) have all been named by the prophets as future Prime Ministers. It seems probable that no such change will be made till the % state of the oil dispute becomes clearer than it is at present. Perhaps also the scandals alleged against Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan Diba, the former Treasurer of the Moyal Household, who is accused of selling places in the Majlis for two thousand Tomans and then not securing the payer’s election, may have delayed the opening of the new Majlis. One Amir Mansur, son of Mirza Fathuilah Khan Akbar (Sipahdar- •^io-A’zam), a disappointed candidate, is, 1 a® credibly informed from many sources, suing Dib&amp; for the return of two thousand Tomans lost by him in this disappoi C l investment. 7# Of one thing 1 am guite certain; namely. that the Shah keeps cabinet, Majlis and government completely under hi. personal eontrol.

Mr, Hoare's confidential despatch of 29th December on P.Z.518 is of great interest as giving his own impression of the reasons for the fall of Teymourtache and the various conflicting rumours on the subject in Tehran. From his telegram of 18th January it will be seen that Teyrnour is now under domiciliary arrest ana that 'it Shah's language has been correctly reported to me it means that Shah has decided to break Teymourtache completely and make him the scapegoat for A.P.O.C.lolly'. The latest telegram' No.SO does not definitely confirm this, but records that^the Shah appears to be 'in a shocking mood and savagely incensed against Teymourtache'. As for the reference to Prince Piruz, it will be remembered that the prince, havingMinister of Finance and involved in rather doubtful financial transactions, was brought to trial, sentenced, convicted and heavily fined. 2 . While, as Mr. Hoare remarks in his despatch of 17th January (paragraph 8), fee * period of personal government may in some ways he very inconvenient, Teymourtache has shown himself so adroit and skilful a diplomat in his dealings with us that anything which will effectively keep him off the stage for a considerable time to come is from our point of view probably to be welcomed.

I t IN r ICATED m my telegram No. 244 of the 27th December that the Minister for loreign Affairs liad very little information to give on the subject of the dismissal of Teymourtache from his functions as Minister of Court I did not think it worth while to telegraph that he hazarded the indecisive opinion that the mam reason was the Shah s dissatisfaction at his continuing to associate with Diba after his dismissal (see my despatch No. 508 of the 2nd December). 2 . It appears, howevei, that the Diba connexion is to be at least the official version, as the Minister of War, who is not usually very voluble, told a long story last night to the effect that the presence of Diba at the Court had always been distasteful to the Shah, who had made his views known to Teymourtache without obtaining any response. 3 Finally the Shah plainly intimated to Teymourtache that he did not want to see Diba again and he waited patiently for some considerable time for Teymourtache to give effect to his wishes. There was still no response, and so His Majesty was compelled to take action himself, and having taken action, the Shah hoped that Teymourtache would cease to be on intimate terms with a man who was notoriously disreputable (this is true, even by Persian standards); to make sure, however, he instructed the police to report Teymourtache’s movements, and to his indignation he learnt that the intimacy between the Teymourtache and Diba family continued. This, we are to understand, was an assertion of individual liberty which could not be brooked, and the Shah instructed his personal secretary to inform Teymourtache that his presence was no longer required at the Court. Teymourtache thereupon requested the Minister of War to intercede on his behalf and a reply came back that the Shah desired him not to leave his house for a fortnight, that he appreciated the services which he had rendered, but that for political reasons he could not, for the present, be entrusted with any official functions. None the less, the Shah would be very glad to see him and receive his advice on political matters at frequent intervals. . , 4. There is in all this one thing that I know to be a fact viz., that Teymourtache went to the cinema with Diba and his wife on the day or the day after, that Diba was dismissed. For the rest, the story can be accepted, bu only as an act of faith. 5 . There are, of course, many other stories . One of the most civilised Persians of my acquaintance appears to believe that Teymourtache has fallen into disgrace because he has ^Persian favourable to British interests and has accepted money from the g 011 OtheTLintam that the affairs of the NatKinal Ban^areAe mam cau^ of the trouble, and they have m support ‘ ,1 f |, '' I , ; l j’ in ( ] ext remely unpleasant in my despatch No. 352) Teymourtache undoubtedly h^ an e«re y of interview with the Shah in August, after the investigations imo the bank had been in progress for two mon s. • „i, ou t his son’s future. Another theory is that the Shah is becomi g j^ e ac0O rdingly decided not being over-confident of his own expec a m ■ m w hich Teymourtache that Teymourtache was too prominent and that a regency ^ would inevitably play the leading par '''J' , i i jy ma( je up his mind that Yet another theory is that the S , hah a Jttkment both with His Teymourtache has, for his own e n ^ ^ Government and has thereby brought Majesty's Government and with the o [691 r—2]A \ ± f about the one result which Persia should avoid, i.e., uneasy relations with both P0 Xally we are told that Teyraourtache and Diba are to be haled before a court-martial. 6 I dare say that many factors have contributed something to the Shah’s decision- I do not however' believe that the Shah would have dismissed his Minister of Court if he had felt entirely happy as to the outcome of the cancella tion of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Concession. ^ 7 On learning the news of Teymourtache s dismissal 1 wrote him a short personal note indicating my regret at the severance of our official relations and sayino- that the discussions on the subject of the general treaty which we had had woula remain a happy memory, sorry though I was that we had been unable to reach a final conclusion. I received a cordial reply m which Teymourtache expressed his appreciation of the efforts which I had made to solve outstanding questions. . . . , . 8 . It is believed that the Shah does not intend to attempt to find a substitute for Teymourtache, but will now act more directly as his own Prime Minister and always be accessible to members of the Government. The prospect is rather alarming' as it seems likely that in some cases irrevocable decisions, such as that cancelling the D’Arcy Concession, will be lightly taken and that in others no decision whatsoever will be obtainable; it is noteworthy that since Taghi Zadeli shook off the yoke of Teymourtache and obtained real control of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs finds it impossible, when called upon to intervene on behalf of a foreign mission, to get anything done. 9. It must be imagined that the Shah realises that Teymourtache is the only swan amongst his flock of geese, and I therefore hope that what I have called the official version is so far true that His Majesty will not take against him any extreme measures which would render his return to a position of authority impossible.

I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1 . Acting Consul Summer scale to Mr. Hoare. (No. 45. Confidential.) Sir, Shiraz, November 3, 1932. I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 35 of the 7th September in which it was mentioned that it was rumoured locally that His Imperial Majesty Shah Reza Pahlavi would shortly visit Shiraz. 2. In the course of the month of October it became apparent that the rumour was well founded. The municipality showed great energy in improving the roads of the city, cleaning and whitewashing the public buildings and obliging builders on the main thoroughfares to finish at least the fronts of new constructions at short notice. The army drilled with greater zeal than evei and practised mass cheering. School children were instructed in waving nagb an their parents told to provide them with new khaki suits. Many a caipet was reluctantly sold to raise the necessary money. On the 22nd Octobei t e overnoi General left for Abadeh to inspect the Isfahan road. At the same time triumphal arches were raised along the main Khiabans, an a i e a §&gt; streamers and carpets were brought out in l*™ eI ?’ a * t i ie including the bazaar, colourfully decorated. On the 2 0 0 % j Shah’s arrival in Isfahan was heard the army new umiovms amUhe gendarmerie at last replaced their faded and ragge app c ^ 3^‘imitations were issued by Gate held in the garden of Hajji Mohamed Mehdi a j ' , • we ]j as to the to the British, French and Soviet consular re^ the leading notables of Shiraz.

There was no cheering Outside the citadel he Shah nerformed the one grfcious act marking his arrival-he spoke to and patted a few scCSirls who were drawn up and ordered that two of his cars should ?d! it™ fm- a ride The Shah was escorted by fifteen open cars carrying his personaTeseort^ in Addition to a few others for his staff, The Minister of War Sardar Asad Bakhtiari, and the Commander-in-chief, Ahmad Khan, accompanied him. At the citadel the Shah’s personal escort mounted guard over his Zi quarters, while the remaining Shiraz guards and gendarmerie were relieved of their ammunition. In the evening the town was gaily illuminated, the effect, particularly around the Maidan on which the Attends being pleasing and even artistic. Crowds, however, were not allowed to assemble, the police were active and the general impression was sombre rather than gay_ On the next day the Shah inspected the cavalry barracks in the town and the infantry barracks at Bagh-i-Takht. The troops paraded and, at the Shahs orders, performed exercises in the nature of mock skirmishing He was reported to have been pleased with the cleanliness of the buildings and the performance o the troops. On Sunday he started the day at 9 • 30 a.m. by interviewing the heads of the local government departments. The Governor-General made a mistake m the name of the head of the Adlieh and was reprimanded. The heads of the Census and Telegraph Departments were also censured for dilatoriness and inefficiency, while Mohamed Ali Khan Shaibani, Director of Finances, heard himself described in very unflattering terms. After this the Mujtahids called upon him, but received only the briefest audience. Next appeared the municipal employees, merchants and the heads of the various trades or guilds, and other notables. The head of the municipality was told to reduce the municipal expenditure. The merchants petitioned the Shah to relax the import restrictions, particularly on cloth. In reply he said : “ With yon I am most displeased. You are not merchants, you are brokers. Why do you not set up factories instead of leaving your money abroad? Why do yon not learn from the Parsis, who have set up silk factories ? ” At this point the most venerable Shiraz merchant, 70-year-old Hajji Mirza Ahmad Khan Parsa, and the editor of the Gulistm, and, some say, one or two others coughed. Thereupon the Shah angl'd}' terminated the audience and turned everyone out. 4. Meanwhile, the date of the Shah’s departure and next destination remained a matter for conjecture. Before his arrival it was generally believed that he intended to visit the new town of Tul-i-Khosro in the Mamassani country. However, he was reluctantly informed on Monday that a caravan taking stores to the new town had been attacked and robbed two days previously. It is said w ^ aS i vlse ^ 1 ° abandon the project, and. in any case, he left early on ednesday morning for Kazerun. It was given out that the trip to Mamassani a een given up because the town was not completed. f oy, • 0 his sta ff the Shah delegated the inspection of the hospitals j- f * laZ i anc * . I ar gcst Toys’ school. The military hospital was alleged to be i a T? d under-staffed. Additional beds and nurses were irmripofpp] 6 ' j 01 , Even the Church Missionary Society’s Hospital was com nipt inn splendour of the new buildings, which are nearing planned and ^ atte nti°n from the old hospital which is admittedly poorly planned inadequate The school was declared overcrowded. his short stav e ii ?

The merchants were treated to a lecture andthen unceremoniously dismissed. On the day following his arrival the Shah ordered that all the decorations of the city should be take! down, and t was ont with the greatest difficulty that the Governor-General persuaded him to accept the presents offered to him by the town. One, a rare copy of Hafiz’s poems, he said he would be glad to send to his son in Switzerland; the other was a gold tray. From first to last the Shah seemed to have aimed at intimidating and dragooning all those he met. His very hist act was to upbraid the local commanding officer ^jr having put the troops into new uniforms. He showed no appreciation of the striking cleanliness and orderliness of the city, nor of the quite effective decorations. His manneis and language, termed {£ rough and vulgar , 55 particulai ly to the mei chants, was such that many of them went away feeling hurt and resentful. It may be that he thinks, and he may be right in thinking, that the only way to treat his subjects, particularly the more unruly ones of Ears for whom he has little love, is with a heavy hand and threatening words. His visit has certainly increased the fear if not the respect of the Shah, both amongst the officials and populace of this province. Little liked before, his coming has served to kindle a new resentment felt against him and his regime. At the same time there is amongst the lower classes a realisation that the greater security of these times, particularly against the oppressions of great landowners and local chiefs, is a benefit to be weighed against the higher cost of living and the hated conscription. If love of the Shah is small, respect for his energy and authority is great. That the Shah is apprehensive while in the Province of Pars is indicated by the arrangements for his guards and the giving up of his trip to Tul-i-Khqsro. It is also rumoured that he declined to inspect the city, but went out disguised after midnight to walk through the bazaar. These precautions, and others previously mentioned, show that the Shah realises the extent of his unpopularity and is still very apprehensive and cautious while in Ears. The inhabitants of the province on their side think it reasonable for him to be suspicious and wary and look upon his precautions as prudence rather than weakness. His visit has certainly not served to win over the people to a more friendly and loyal attitude, and, it would seem, no attempt was made in that direction, although the moment was certainly more favourable than on the occasion of his previous visit m 1 ^ b. During the month preceding the Shah's visit security on the mam roads of t e province was good; no robberies occurred on them and those on minor roads were reduced. A number of bandits were captured—not always by c T e ^ lt ^ le —and Ali Khan, the rebellious third brother of Sowlat, moved further up into the mountains.^ mention two interpretations of certain incidents made by a small number of people locally.

I had conveyed to the Governor of the Gulf Ports my desire to meet His Majesty. His Excellency at first intimated that together with the rest of the British community and other local notables, I and my stall should meet His Majesty on his arrival from Bora&amp;Jan, where he was going to stay the night on his way from Shiraz, at a short distance outside Bus hire on the Shiraz road where some tents had been pitched for the purpose.

His Majesty arrived on the morning of „j atavfid a few minutes at the 2nd as noted acove, ana s ay- His Britannic Majesty's Minister, British Legation, Tehran. the tents.the tents. He was as usual on his travels in a had temper, and his greeting of those collected to receive him was somewhat brief. One of the Russians present had omitted to remove his hat. His Majesty enquired whether he was a Qhristian, a Jew, or a Moslem. The Russian, upset by this enquiry into the nature of his religious belief, stammered some what doubtfully that he was a Christian. Whereupon His Majesty - not iilogically - enquired why he had not followed the Christian custom of removing his head-gear before a royal personage. On the same day I received intimation from His Excellency conveying a message from His Majesty to the effect that as the latter had no representa tives of his Foreign office with him he was unable to receive numbers of this Consul ate-General officially! ■but that he would be pleased to see us unofficially at a time and place to be notified anon. Later a message was received from the Governor that His Fajesty would be very pleased to meet myself and my staff unofficially when embarKing at Dastait at 9 o’clock on the morning of the 5th.

His Majesty talked to me foi some minutes. The gist of his remarks being that that he much desired that relations between his oliicials and British officials in Persia should be harmonious, I replied, which incidentally was quite true, that the relations in Bush ire between His Excellency the Governor and myself were most cordial and harmonious. His Majesty appeared pleased at this and shortly afterwards embarked on board the M Babr ”, 5, A launch carried some of His Majesty's staff, but he himself was conveyed by what looked like a small speedboat. For some reason or other a Persian sailor stood in the ^ow which of course brought the head of the boat down into the water, leaving only a few inches of free-board, and if there had been anything of a sea His Majesty would have had to swim for it. 6 . I confess that I have always felt a good deal of admiration for His Majesty: no man could have raised himself from the position or a private soldier to that of Shah, whatever his faults may he, without certain robust qualities, chiefly perhaps those of •■blood and iron*. I was impressed by His Majesty's appearance. He has rather run to fat hut certainly gave me the idea of being a strong man. 1 do not know whether, from the Persian point of view, his visit to Bush ire has been a success; though the Go o - a - ipvel-headed and capable individual vernor who is a level n-auo „ it qo I hevr, however, that on id his best to mahe it so. i ns* &gt; * • v,t in Pushire, when he was accommodated tis first night in fufann ,in the Governor's building in the town, His Majestj was eaten by mosquitoes, and given a head by the smell 01 paint, his bed-room having been freshly decorated for the occasion.

WITH reference to my despatch fsio. 334 of the 29th July in which I reported the illness of the Minister of Court, I have the honour to inform you that his Highness returned from the seaside on the 4th August and was present at the annual reception given by the Majlis to celebrate the establishment of a consti tutional regime in Persia. He appeared to me to be in fair health, but his gaiety, as always rather boisterous, seemed rather forced. He told me that his doctors insist on his leading a very quiet life, including virtual abstention from tobacco. 2. It is not possible to state what precisely has occurred. There is, however, every reason to believe that the immediate cause of Teymourtache’s illness, which was probably angina pectoris or excessive blood pressure, or both, w T as a violent scene with the Shah. No one else was present at the audience when the scene is believed to have occurred, and it is therefore not known what was the cause of the trouble. The surmise which finds most general acceptance is that the investi gations which have been proceeding for over two montns into the affairs of the National Bank have revealed irregularities for which Teympurtache is largely responsible. There is a virtual certainty that exchange operations of an unseemly nature have been performed, some of them it is freely alleged for the Shah s own benefit. . . . . , . , 3 Where nothing is certain, except that Teymourtache is obviously worried as well as ill, it is pardonable to reconstruct in the imagination a scene at which the Minister’s self-control broke down under reproaches whic , t ougi possi y “‘f • s,*d ?Sf„'S'£ there was a crisis.

It must be treated with all reserve, as the source is not impeccable, but it is tar from being inherently improbable and is in any case illustrative of the Shah s reputation :— • • • * \ ^ number of mullahs, sayids, proprietors and agriculturists of the Mahal-i-Salasseh, of Tunakabun, have been arrested, together with the sons of the well-known Yahya Khan Amlashi, a big landowner in Amlash and its neighbourhood, and have been sent to Tehran and else where under orders from Tehran. The excuse for their arrest is that they were plotting against the present Government. But this is not the case. Information gathered from persons connected with the present Administrator of the Tunakabun properties of the Shah is to the effect that these people own lands in the midst of the other properties of the Shah in Tunakabun and have valid and legal title-deeds and enjoy hereditary possession. The Administrator has reported this fact to Tehran and has received instructions in reply requiring him to apply to the local Registration Office for the registration of the whole of the properties in Tunakabun, and give out that the petty landowners must state their objections and file their titles and claims within the prescribed time limit. In the meantime all such persons are being arrested on charges of plotting against the present regime of the country. When the time limit for the filing of objections has lapsed, these persons will be set free and their charges left unexamined 2 The acting oriental secretary has heard quite independently of one land- owner (Salar Fath Div-Salar) who has been arrested apparently because he owns a piece of land that the Shah covets. . . i i • - n 3 In other ways His Imperial Majesty is taking an u y questions of land ownership.

His time in prison was spent with many other property owners from Mazanderan, whose land had suffered in the same way. They all said that if the market price had been paid for their land they would not have minded selling it and purchasing property in another part of Persia. In most of these cases there appears to be no question of doubtful title, as the property has been in the hands of the same family for generations. The family of another very wealthy Mazandteran land- owner, Sardar Jalil, who has recently died, have also been brought to Tehran, where all of them, including the women, are in prison. 7. It is doubtful whether the Shah is personally aware of the vast amount of dissatisfaction which such arbitrary acts have engendered. His Imperial Majesty keeps a special official at work on the management of his large estates, and when petitions arrive they first go to this official, who suppresses those which he considers it imprudent to show to his Royal master. 8 . Not long ago Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, w T ho is rightly the most respected man in the country, spoke to me in tones of genuine dismay about His Imperial Majesty’s insatiable land hunger. It is reaching such a point that it will soon be permissible to wonder why His Imperial Majesty does not, without more ado, register the whole of Persia in his own name, imprisoning all landowners until the period prescribed for objections has passed. 9.

Confidential.) ttattt- i Tehran, March 9, 1932. 1 HAVE the honour to report that the police authorities of Tehran have recently arrested a number of Persians, apparently on suspicion of being concerned in a plot of a revolutionary nature. Ever since the arrival of the Turkish Minister for foreign Affairs in Tehran last January, I have received reports of arrests made and heard many rumours as to their true cause. Shortly before the arrival of Tevfik Ru§tii Bey, indeed, I observed that the police officers stationed in the streets of Tehran were armed with rifles; enquiries elicited the unconvincing explanation that they were issued in order to show extra respect to the important visitor. 2. I believe that about forty persons in all are under arrest. A good many of them are minor employees of various Ministries, such as the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, of National Economics, of Justice, and of Foreign Affairs. A few T Armenians are also among those arrested; a fact which no doubt gave rise to the least plausible of the many stories circulating in explanation; namely, that the cause of the arrests was a plot by Armenians to murder Tevfik Ru§tii Bey. One of the secretaries of the Prime Minister has also been arrested. 3. Another rumour explains the arrests as being due to the discovery of an elaborate spying organisation in the pay of the Minister of Court; this rumour is probably traceable to some of the many Persians who are en\ ious of the great man’s success and would not be sorry to see him share the fate of Mirza and others. Yet another story connects the arrests with a plot to establish a republic, and leaflets advocating this form of government are said to have been distributed from an aeroplane. ‘The most probable story appears to be one which connects the arrests with a Bolshevik plot for the overthrow of the present regime. T , Persian press has denied that anyone has been arrested at a , a s a e no one believes^to developments during the past two months ar e worth mentioning, and may be related to the foregoing facts. One is that a consideraW number of the principal personages belonging to the Tehran' such as the Qashqais, and the Khamseh Arabs, to remain fn where they are either in prison or under survei a , , summoned to Tehran.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Shah arrived at Hamadan late on the afternoon of the 26th and left again early next morning. He took no apparent interest in local matters, and had in fact sent orders ahead for the striking of the tents which, in accordance with the usual custom, had been pitched outside the town for his reception. For their part also the townspeople and the peasantry did not seem to be very interested in the Royal visit, and large crowds did not line the roads at the time of the Shah’s arrival. Those who had collected in this way were given no chance of seeing him, for the closed car drove fast right up to the house of Ibrahim Khan Gharagozlou, where the Shah spent the night. , . With the heads of the various Government Departments, who awaited him outside this house, the Shah did not pause to speak, except to tell the president ol the Western Court of Appeal that he had heard complaints about the local courts This official, who has the reputation of being unusually efficient and tonest, is understood to have replied that these complaints were pro ay owing to the under-staffing of the lower courts. v.r.ooontf.finn to the Many petitions were received by the Governora e ^ P .

Kermanshmh, September 30, 1931. r ’ j EAVE the honour to submit n report on the visit of the fehah to this district l h i r s 1 I * j| a *g t ““* du e a t Kermanshah by the 18th September and feverish preparations were made during the preceding week. Work on the new central avenue of the town, which is still unfinished, continued throughout. A new road leadino- from the town to Taq-i-Bustan as a continuation of the Shahpur Avenue, off the Maidan was opened for the occasion. This road is not fully metalled, and! was closed to traffic after the Shah’s visit. The Governor-General was in charge of the municipality in the absence of the Rais-i-Baladiyeh, who had been recalled to Tehran at his own request. His successor managed to postpone his arrival until after the Royal visit. Issues of new uniform were made to the troops, and the prisoners were taken to the public baths and shaved. 3 His Majesty reached this town on the 22nd September at 3 p.m., coming from Senneh, which he had left that morning. His journey was broken at Kameyaran for luncheon. He drove direct to the house of Ali Khan, Amir-i-Kull, the leading notable, chief of the Zanganeh tribe and Deputy for Kermanshah, where he spent the next two nights. Amongst his suite were Aghai Assaad Sardar Assaad, Minister of War, Amir-i-Nizam, the Grand Master of Ceremonies, Agha Shakah-ul-Mulk, Comptroller of the Royal Household, and Dr. Amir Khan Aalam, Amir-i-Aalam, private physician. 4. The Governor-General, Prince Assadullah Mirza, Shahab-ud-Dowleh, K.C.V.O., and the local officials were awaiting the arrival of the Shah at the gates of the house, and, on alighting, he called up the Governor and expressed his dissatisfaction at the large number of his subjects seen by him during his journey and in the town not wearing the Pahlavi hat and up-to-date clothing. It is said that the Shah was particularly incensed as the Ministry of the Interior had drawn the attention of the local authorities some time before his arrival to the inadequate compliance with Government orders for the change of dress. His Majesty’s host, Amir-i-Kull, was later able to assure him that the people he had seen were Kurds from outlying villages not within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General. 5. Strict measures had been taken to safeguard the Shah on his arrival, and a communique of the authorities prohibited the presentation of petitions, and the throwing of flowers during his passage, whilst no one was allowed on the house- tops along the way. Policemen with revolver in hand were stationed on the ioo s during the Royal passage. This last measure led to comments that the visits d PP eare ^ more afraid of attempts upon his life than during previous Amru u eveni I n £&gt;. arT ival, the Shah inspected the stables of the nnd Ifni / 311 , ex P re f ed ^ ls satisfaction.

Amongst these was an application on behalf of many families of Jehi Assyrians settled at Baqnbah in Iraq for permission to settle upon his estates at Shahabad (Harunabad). The Shah made no definite reply. 9. On the 22 nd September six brigands, who had attacked traders and villagers in the vicinity of Sahneh, were arrested by Amnieh guards. The Shah was informed and gave orders for their immediate execution. Two of the men were hanged at Ghorgavisheh, one of the villages molested, and the other four were shot at Sahneh on the next day. 10. The Shah left Kermanshah early on the 24th September for his estates at Shahabad, and passed through this town again on the 26th September on his way to Hamadan. He was then reported to have been in good humour and to have treated the Governor-General better than whilst he was staying at Kermanshah. Whilst at Shahabad His Majesty received the chiefs of tribes and visited the two local schools, one of which gives agricultural instruction. He gave orders for some improvements at these. 11. The bad temper of the Shah is attributed to his dissatisfaction with the officer commanding at Senneh for the bad condition of the troops and military material in that town. He is said to have placed this officer under arrest. Nothing appeared to please His Majesty in the principal city of Persian Kurdistan, and he remarked that the town had made no progress since nis last visit. Another report states that he received^ a telegram on arrival announcing the destruction by fire of a military depot at Tabriz. , , • i 12. As a sequel to the Shah’s visit, the Governor-General has obtamed an undertaking from local tailors and hat-makers not to make . e lir ls . |. and clothing, whilst village headmen have been ordered to prevent the wea a of these. j mDress i 0 n of the visit is that it has been beneficial for the town and people.'

Subect :— Visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to Sistan , Consulate Area . In compliance with the instructions contained in Circular Despatch No. 16 of 18 th April, I have the honour to submit a report on the recent visit of His Imperial Majesty The Shah to East Persia. H. I. M. The Shah arrived at Birjand at 4 p.m., on the 17th November 1930. An inspection of the Military Detachment was held and fault was found with the Officer Commanding owing to the poor condition of the Cavalry horses. Officials and representatives of the gentry and merchants were present in tents, pitched, a short distance from the town. The Shah spoke to the leading Mullah Shaik Hadi, but no other presentations were made. He proceeded at once to the private house of H. E. Shaukat U1 Mulk, where he spent the night. He left for Safidawa at 7 a.m., on the 18th. Tents had been pitched for the accommodation of His Majesty and Stan for the night of 18th/19th. The Governor of Sistan and Sarhang Murteza Khan from Sistan were there to receive His Majesty, who besides his staff was accompanied by Shaukat III Mulk and Hissam Ud Dowleh (Governor of Birjand). The Minister of Court who had accompanied His Majesty to Meshad remained in Khorassan, it is said to inspect the landed property of the Mutawalli Bashi of Meshad shrine. , A.

The Shah warmly commended the scheme to the Governor-General, said he might himself invest money in it and ended up by saying that my present activities were atonement for my past deeds. 4 . Of the other delegations only the representatives of firms such as the weavers received any notice. The notables were dismissed with the curt words « i have no business with you ”. The Shah seemed bent on emphasising the importance of industrial and economical progress. To the merchants he pressed his disappointment at Kerman’s backward state and the fact that car was not cheered by the glad sound of a factory hooter. When the delegation of European merchants was presented and Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia was introduced the Shah asked Governor-General in a tone of feigned surprise whether a branch of the Impe rial Bank of Persia existed at Kerman. The Assistant Superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department w T as politely ignored. 5. To the Mullahs he said :—“ What are you doing ”. On their replying that they were praying for him he told them that was not sufficient: they should render service to Islam of which he saw little signs. To make the people weep was no such service. This was an allusion to the t£ rozah khwani” in connection with the period of national mourning during the month of Moharram. The delegation of the Red Lion and Sun wer^ told that they were too much of the Mullah class. The Jews were asked if they were Mullahs that they should grow long beards. When the Parsis appeared His Majesty poked fun at one of their leading lights, Arbab Surushian, in that he wore his Pehlevi hat as if he was not accustomed to it and that his trousers were too baggy. At this point Arbab Kaikhusran intervened with the remark that the Parsis were all His Majesty’s faithful and humble servants.

Ik 1k Late on the evening of the 19th a letter was received from the Governor- ate, addressed to “ the Office of H. B. M. Consul ” in which it was said that His Majesty would arrive at the Naurab (stretch of water four miles from Sistan where cars have to be ferried over on rafts) at 3 p.m., the following dav and that a tent had been pitched for the Consular Corps, and the latter should ba present at the tent at 2-30 p.m. elicited the informaiion that nothing was known as to procedure, but that His Majesty and Staff would certainly be in uniform. On arrival at the tent, w r e were received by the clerk of the Municipality. The Soviet Consul and Staff and the Afghan Consul were already in the tent. As I had never previously met the former the clerk effected an intro duction. Persian was the only foreign language known to the Russian Consul and his staff. The Consul’s knowledge was limited, but sufficient to maintain a conventional conversation. Pour tents had been pitched, one for the Shah, one for Persian Officials, one for the Consular Corps and one by Indian traders. A small cavalry Guard of Honour was present, and the route towards the Town was sparsely lined for about a mile by followers of local Sirdars with camels and ponies. At a distance of about two miles from the Town the school-children were drawn up ready to smg a poem of PW have been practising for some months, much to the detriment of the peace ot Sistan. ^ . When His Maiesty descended from the raft at 3-30 p.m. he was some- — SE&amp;S&amp; - “ •' — iD the tent and that “ if required we would be sent for .

The Shah could be heard admonishing them m a loud voi‘ but it wis not possible to hear what was actually sa.d, from our position in the adjacent tent. They retired without haVmg preferred the numerou requests they had to make for ’ assistance m furthering the trade of s' There now remained only the Indian traders and the Consular Corps' The former had pitched a very tastefully decorated tent and had flattered themselves that His Majesty would be pleased to enter it. They were not presented, and their salutes as His Majesty subsequently drove past their tent were not acknowledged. After a weary wait of close upon two hours the Amir-i-Lashkar now inti mated that His Majesty would receive the Consular Corps. His Majesty st^od alone in the tent which was small so that the threshold was not more than two yards from where he stood. The Amir-i-Lashkar stood at attention outside the tent and gave no indication of the procedure to he adopted. I accordingly walked up to the edge of the tent and saluted thus un wittingly laying myself open to the treatment already meted out to the Tele graph Master, about which I had not then learnt the details. His Majesty said nothing, but beckoned with his forefinger for me to approach, the signal being' similar to that usually employed to call a cab, could not be mistaken and in that respect I w r as more fortunate than the Reis-i-Telegraph'. His Majesty shook hands, then shook hands with the Russian Doctor under the impression that he was the Consul. He was almost genial towards the Afghan Consul, declaring that he recog nised him as having been in Tehran some years ago, made some enquiries as to how he liked Sistan and finally instructed him to call to see him at 6 p.m. His Majesty then turned to me. Meanwhile the Amir-i-Lashkar had entered the tent and explained that I was Major Daly, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Sistan. His Majesty seemed somewhat confused and considered for a moment while 1 he muttered, “ Delhi, Delhi, what has he to do with Delhi ? ” The Amir-i-Lashkar then explained that Daly was my name. His Majesty then enquired how lonsr I had been in Persia and learnino' from the Amir-i-Lashkar that I spoke Persian, asked where I had learnt the language; He further enquired whether I did not consider that Sistan was a highly important district. I replied that it was, and that it was capable of considerable development which would doubtless take place under the favour of His Majesty’s rule. he couldlf Tl a ‘ thi !- and ex P lained ''as unfortunate that know ” d * P d m ° re time here ’ but added “ 1 sha11 fiud ou t all I want to isistan 6 ^he rente w! an Coasul if tijei-e wer e any Russian subjects in to say somethin^ Vit olit Ih !g g ' atl . ve : p* Majesty appeared to be about many British subjects. ^ * S mmi al1 ' turning to me asked if there were come to meet hi^^ 01 }^ om ) o'rtnn't landS me ’ and thanked me for having the Consulate Staff His Maiestv'e^ PTfi t° Present any members of all these people ? ” and on learn L i h qUlred ° f the ^h'i-Lashkar “ Who are said “ Oh I see ”, ‘^nimg they were members of the Consulate Staffs and proceeded aU^reaT''pace^SHa 1 '' ^ Ik 1 ' 6 ] the Shah entered bis car ^ e couid be - a. “”£•« « MM «hin«., „ of brirfi wood oil his head whteh he'htdteTaf hf 11 bearing a small pile is M qesty stop ps d his Car to enquire the^1 172 the man that he was much 0 'nt)re f ;«;( ^ tnr v.™ j i ,, that of his neighbours was one of cohtiuml t P osi ^on and would enquire into the state 6 f the His Ma i e ^y &lt;*&amp; he had becji %iZ Ud ^ ' h ' Cb borrowed from this Consulate a deal of the furn.ture having been After dark he drove through the Khiyabahw of the “ new ” town This town which has been constructed within the year by SarhT- Murteza Khan m anticipation of His Majesty’s visit is common v known as the town of walls It is distinguished Iby the fait that ,t has no inhabitants, although giving the illusion of line streets and sumptuous houses Ihere are some eight wide, straight avenues, brilliantly illuminated at ni ? ht by eleciicity,^bounded ou either side by high white-washed walls and with quite magnificent uorches at regular intervals, apparently the entrances of houses of the wealthy.

He also complimented Hisam Ud Dowleh on his )dern dwelling and told Shankat Ul Mulk to learn from his nephew and bring his fine old Persian house at Birjand “ up to date Those who anticipated that they would see His Majesty inspect the town etc., the following day, were astounded to learn that he had already left for Duzdap at 6 a. m on the 20 th. The only mark of his visit seemed to be that Sistan was bo longer to be known as such, but henceforth to revert to its ancient name of Zabul. On arrival at llurmak 30 miles from Duzdap, the Shah was met by the Governor and Officials of that place. Captain A'ban, His Majesty s Vice- Consul had been asked to be there and was introduced to His Majesty be!ore any others. M. Graux, the Director of Customs was questioned as to the customs receipts and Herr Gaenzer as to the progress of the National Bank. Tne Shah then retired to a small house for lunch and rest. A mile from the town Persian and Indian traders ha . d set ^ an the school children, dressed in khaki misfits for the occasion stood • The Shah inspected the Military Guard of honour Pf/^Vhan t schoolchildren.

Jaj2173 M Gnmx complains bitterly of the insolence of the servants of this high ofB c i a i' who stole all they could lay their hands on while their master was : being entertained. While M. Graux was bowing his farewell to His Majesty on the latters departure for Mirjawa on the morning of the 22nd, the servants of the Minister for War were occupied in looting his house of everything easily removable. His Majesty received throughout his tour, many very valuable gifts, which he was pleased to accept. The exceptions to this were presentations of camels and. horses by the Sardars, which His Majesty returned to the donors. It cannot be said that the visit of His Majesty was looked fo-rward to with any enthusiasm, but undoubtedly it was, with interest. In the case of Sistan, hopes had been encouraged by Sarhang Murteza Khan and others, that the Shah would really take the Agricultural situation into hand and give definite orders for cancellation of the immense arrears of revenue which can never be realised, but the demand for which hangs like the sword of Damocles, for ever spoiling prospects of a brighter future. Fax from the centre of Government, South East Persia, had for years heard of the striking personality of the Shah. His power and.benevolence had been highly lauded. Such ills as were only too apparent were the work of bad officials. The Shah would put all right. Very few, even of the important Sardars, had ever seen His Majesty. Whatever may have been the object of the Shah’s visit, it certainly has not achieved what must be the principle object of tours undertaken by crowned heads of Europe—increase of popularity of the occupant of the throne. Everywhere, at least everywhere where such statements can be prudently made, one heard expressions of disappointment. The more enlightened were' shocked at the Shah’s lack of graciousness—the common people said. “ He is a. faryaki and with that expression vanished all respect for the Shah’s person.! . Sar hang Murteza Khan—reputed to have great influence with the Shah — is himself not a little dejected since His Majesty’s visit. I asked if the Shah had been pleased with his visit.

In addition to the Deputies already elected, accommodation in the House had been arranged for the Cabinet Ministers and their assistants, the Diplomatic Body, persons of high rank, merchants and journalists. 4. At 10 a.m. His Majesty entered and read the Speech from the Throne, copy in translation of which I beg to enclose, and half an hour later the Parliament assembled in private to discuss its internal organisation. 5. The first month of each fresh Parliament is spent in the verification in different committees of each member’s mandate, in electing the various commissions, and in arranging the details of its internal organisation, and it is only after these matters have been settled that the first open session is held and the Majlis embarks on its two years’ career. 6. The Royal speech betrays the fact that His Majesty is somewhat exercised by the economic situation of the country, and there must lurk a fair measure of anxiety behind the assumption that the natural aptitude and the conditions of Persia will enable it successfully to weather the storm. The remarks made in regard to the conclusion of treaties and arrangements with countries whose friendly feelings towards Persia are beyond doubt probab y re er to Soviet Russia in the hope that a commercial agreement, which has been under discussion for more than a year, may be made on terms more favourable to Persia^ 7.

His Majesty s reference to the Duzdap Railway is perhaps not without interest as a sidelight on the prospects of the general treaty when negotiations are resumed. At first sight it appears to show that the Persian Government are confident as to the final success of the negotiations. Coupled, as it is, with a reference to what the Persian Government are pleased to consider their diplomatic victory over the telegraph questions, it may, on the other hand, indicate a hope that by a policy of procrastination Persia will be able to achieve her own desiderata piecemeal. 3.

I thought it best to treat the matter light-heartedly and noticing that Sardar Assad w as present I replied that I had paid considerable sums, m which the War Minister had’his share. The Shah seemed much amused, and turned to \ssad who smiled sheepishly. His Majesty then said he hopedH now found no necessity to subsidise the tribes 'in the Kerman district, to which I answered that thanks to his beneficent rule, there was nothing for a foreign consul u do but to think of trade and economic matters. I then proceeded to unfold mj project for a cotton-spinning mill and hydro-electric scheme for Kerman. The Shah warmly commended the scheme to the Governor-General, said lie might himself invest money in it, and ended up by saying that my present activities were atonement for my past deeds. 4. Of the other delegations only the representatives of firms such as the weavers received any notice. The notables were dismissed with the curt words : “ I have no business with you.” The Shah seemed bent on emphasising the importance of industrial and economical progress. To the merchants he expressed his disappointment at Kerman's backward state, and the fact that his ear was not cheered by the glad sound of a factory hooter. When the delegation of European merchants was presented and the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia was introduced, the Shah asked the Governor- General, in a tone of feigned surprise, whether a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia existed at Kerman. The assistant superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department was politely ignored. 5. To the mullahs he said ; “ What are you doing? ” On their replying that they were praying for him, he told them that was not sufficient; they should render service to Islam, of which he saw little signs. To make the people weep was no such service. This was an allusion to the “ rozah khwani ” in connexion with the period of national mourning during the month of Moharram. The delegation of the Red Lion and Sun were told that they were too much of the mullah class. The Jews were asked if they were mullahs that they should grow long beards. r th e Parsis ^ appeared His Majesty poked fun at one of their leading lights, Arbab Surushian, in that he wore his Pahlavi hat as if he was not accustomed to it, and that his trousers were too baggy. At this point Arbab Kaikhusnau intervened with the remark that the Parsis were all His Majesty’s ai ft u num ble servants.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that His Majesty the Shah has just returned from a five weeks’ journey, during which he visited Mazanderan, Khorasan, Seistan, the Sarhad, Kerman and Yezd. 2. His Majesty left Tehran on the 27th October by motor car for Mazanderan, where he remained until the 7th November. He was joined on that date by the Cabinet Ministers and the Minister of Court. They all proceeded to Bander Shah in a special train and thence to the Turkoman plain for the annual Turkoman horse races. 3. The Shah then left for Meshed by way of Gumbad Qabus, where he was awaited by the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Division, Bujnurd and Kuchan, whilst the Crown Prince and most of the Cabinet returned to Tehran, only Teymourtache and the Minister of War, Serdar Assad, remaining with His Majesty. 4. The Shah arrived in Meshed on the 11th November, and I beg to enclose herein an extract from the fortnightly diary of His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed describing details of the Royal visit. Meshed was the largest town visited by His Majesty and the account furnished by Colonel Barrett is typical ol what usually happens on such occasions when there is a strong contrast between the orderly reception organised by the military and the confusion and chaos whmh attends e efforts of thl civil authorities. The Shah was loud m his flowed Division, and the General Officer Commanding received his reward by being allowed to go to Europe for a two-years’ course of training m 1 ranee, whither he hurried before tftGfostod on1h7l5t?November, visited Birjand and Seistan and wenKTs^fvfa Duzdab to Khwash ^e ™n from Meshed by air.

He was travelling in an American saloon car. He subsequently expressed dissatis faction with the arrangements made for his reception, as well he might for tip estimable Jam quite lost his head. The Governor-General himself chased up aiT down the line of tents which had been erected, informing the various occupants when it was their turn to make a bow'. Little wonder that w r hen he returned to the Royal presence he was breathless and uncollected, introducing some under the wrong name and entirely forgetting to present others. Eventually, when the merchants of Meshed were announced, such a rabble descended on the Royal tent that His Majesty waved them away in anger and stalked back to his car. At the reception of the consular corps His Majesty had a gracious word to say to Batmanoff, the Soviet consul-general, and doyen of the consular body, whom he recalled having met before in Ahwaz and Shiraz. His Majesty’s consul-general alone addressed the Shah in the vernacular. The Governor-General was distinctly distracted in introducing the remainder of the staff. His Majesty picked up his ears wdren Captain Steveni was presented as attache to the consulate-general and asked : “ What attache?” Jam made a series of incoherent sounds, the Minister of Court, who was standing by, interposed with assurance a dismissive reference to Captain Steveni’s being a member of the consulate staff, but the situation was actually saved by the unspon sored appearance before His Majesty of the acting Afghan consul-general with the introduction of whom Jam hastily proceeded. 255. Some half-dozen cows and camels having been sacrificed en route for good luck, His Majesty v 7 ent to the shrine where it appears the staff work was admirable. He subsequently rode through the town at considerable speed to the army head quarters and residence of the Amir-i-Lashkar which had been set aside for his reception. Throughout the Royal progress through the streets in Meshed no one was allowed at upper-floor windows and armed guards w'ere posted on prominent roofs^ Amnia guards and infantry lined the streets. During his stay in Meshed His Majesty did not receive the consular corps, but held a morning reception of leading officials, whom he addressed, complimenting them on the success their efforts ad achieved, but urging them to work with greater zeal so that the greater pros- nenty and well-being of the country might soon be attained. To the director of the / ^ av ! ? n , 0 complained that his hands were tied because of inadequate staff b / en t0ld by hlS 1 head office t0 retrench), His Majesty promised full while a cWt ° ^ P ro ^ ect that could be devised to extend the bank’s activities, ^u^ Wlth i he , Director of Customs on the subject of opium mononolv^aud talk w 1 ords . from Teymourtache to the director of the opium monopolv who had awfd 118 ^ r ^ t an y rate, Muffakham, the local director of the Seda fifteen days’ leave of absence in Tehran, is and Taghi Zadeh &amp; immediately m order to enlist the support of Feroughi Amir-i-Lashkar has gre^hcmfs th^ft. 6 ^u VGry P lease( f with the military, and the permission to proceed to France to follow a 1 1 GaP &amp; w , ell ~ merited reward in securing there.

Opinion is general that Asadi, the Mutwalli Bashi, who i is knov, n co\ets the post, stands a very good chance of supplanting Jam as Governor-General. &amp; 259. Tim Shah visited the Shrine in the morning of the 15th November and then left for Turbat-i-Haidari with his Tehran escort and w r ith twenty soldiers of the Eastern army. 260. Before leaving with His Majesty, Teymourtache, who is due to return to Meshed from Turbat-i-Haidari, received separately the staffs of the consulates in Meshed. Full reports are circulating of his conversation with the Bolsheviks. It is said that Batmanoff asked for an interview with the Shah which was straightway refused, that he brought up the question of his courier service to the Russian frontier, and was told to refer the matter to his Legation in Tehran and that the Minister of Court promised to accept and enquire into a list of traitors to the Bolshevik regime who were sheltering in Persia. It is impossible, however, to put much faith in reports of this nature or to imagine that to the Bolsheviks Teymourtache was other than he was with the members of this consulate-general—an extremely agreeable and impres sive discurser of mundanities. Certainly, keen ears in an adjoining room and through the burble of pleasant conversation with Jam could detect nothing but a note of loud cordiality throughout the Bolshevik interview. 261. It is 'stated that the Shah has ordered a girls’ school to be opened m Meshed. There are already two in the town. T 262. His Majesty presented the lands of Shahan Garmab, a hot spring possessing miraculous healing properties, 14 farsakhs to the south-east of Meshed, to the Bed Lion and Sun Society of Khorasan He also gave 100 tomans to the woman in charge of the orphanage (a large building outside the town walls to the south erected by Asadi the Mutwalli Bashi), 100 tomans for prayers for himself m the Shrine and 100 tomans for division among the road sweepers employed for is reception.( of considerable) 4 eTelop®*nt whloh would 4ouUla e . te ke pi ft0 « .mdar the f aTOttr •f XI* »4«ty. rule. m. *^t plaam at HO* r.^ fta4 expltlned ttet it was unfortunate that he could not spend acre time here, hut added ' I shall finu out all i want to know*.
