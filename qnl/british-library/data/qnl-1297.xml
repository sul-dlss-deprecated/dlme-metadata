No. 14, Vol. viii. Ar ML 7, 1866. Prick 8 As. Stainpisd 9 As. THE CHARGE OF THE BISHOP OF BOMBAY. H IHE first impression invariably produced by reading any -L Episcopal charge is that of its nselessness as a source of spiritual guidance to the clergy who are addressed, and still more as a source of light upon the many serious ques tions which Bishops usually touch, as it were with thei r finger tips, and then leave. The Bishop of Bombay h a s taken care that his readers shall feel this impression at the outset, and in no ordinary degree, by prefixing to his ' Charge a table of i Topics' which prepares the reader for what is actually to come : a series of fragmentary, not to say scrappy and desultory remarks on a variety of topics, not only ecclesiastical but even secular. The very highest genius in literary expression, inspired by the profoundest religious feeling, and with the power of condensation of a Tacitus, might perhaps, in the short compass of an episcopal charge, adequately deal with subjects ranging from the position and functions of a newspaper editor, to the decrees of the council of the Trent. We should be doing much more than justice to the Bishop of Bombay if we were to credit him with such powers and such knowledge. And upon the whole, except as a perfunctory sacrifice to the etiquette of the Episcopal position, we find it not a little difficult to understand why the silence preserved by the Bishop of Bombay on Church topics for five years should have been broken at all. Under all circumstances perhaps the most interesting thing to the Christian and general public of an Indian Diocese about its Bishop is, not what he says, but what he is and what he does. The Bishop of Bombay is clearly of the same opinion. It is impossible not to appreciate highly the modest self-appreciation which has led him to address his clergy so rarely. And it is interesting to see how this principle of self-controul, founded so evidently upon a correct appreciation of the value of what he has to produce when he finally does break silence, works upon the Bishop's mind. ' Five years have elapsed' he tells his clergy | 4 since I last addressed the clergy from this seat.' This is evidently no ordinary title to respect in a generation whose fault is incontinence of speech and writing. The charge which the Bishop now delivers, is indeed, the best possible justification of his five years silence. Nor indeed was it necessary for his Lordship to have postponed its delivery for another year for fear lest he should, had he delivered it earlier, have interfered with the impression produced upon the minds of the clergy by the first quinquennial visitation of the Metropolitan. For unless there was in the actual utterance and delivery of the charge unusual fire, and force, and inspiration of manner—a point on which of course not having been present we cannot speak—it seems clear to us that, as far as the substance of the charge goes, it could hardly, when ever delivered have ' interrupted the impressions' created by any other personage, or speech, or occasion whatsoever. It is, then, only |on account of the peculiar personal relation of the Bishop of Bombay to his flock and his church, that we have thought it worth while to give a brief critical examination to the charge delivered at his Fourth visitation: not by any means because the matter, by reason of the w T eight of the opinions expressed required such notice. But nevertheless it is painful to us not to be able to separate altogether, these two things, which indeed, is impossible. A Bishop, great either as a Theologian, or as a Pastor, or illustrious for piety, a Hooker, or a Ken needs must in his charges express himself on current necessities and controversies so as to move deeply the minds of his hearers and the public. It would be in the highest degree unreasonable to complain of Bishop Harding for not being a Hooker or a Ken. But there is a certain standard of. Episcopal performance, both in the general life and the direct Work of the Episcopate, and also in the specific function ol authoritative V isitatorial guidance, by which we needs tost, try all those who fill so great an office. As a general rule there is a certain restraining decorum in discussing purely personal qualities or habits. As a general rule critics who respect themselves extend largely those limits of the private life which are forbidden ground to their strictures. We shall not infringe this rule in the present case. Our reflections on the substance and matter of this charge, and our conclusion of the shortcomings of Bishop Harding fronl a stand ard of Episcopacy far short of a Hooker, or a Ken, shall not in any w T ay be reinforced by more than an allusion to the dignified self-protection with which he has been known, throughout his episcopal career, to guard himself not less from the dangers of heresy, than from the dangers of a tropical climate. The Bishop discusses at the outset the position of the clergy as regards salaries, and echoes in his own depart ment' the universal complaint of the underpayment of English officials in India. And, in this connection, the Bishop considers the question whether a member of what he calls the ' Ecclesiastical Service' should, while on furlough, be editor of a daily paper. To decide this question in the negative was perhaps proper. At all events we shall not controvert the Bishop's decision. But the language which his Lordship employs in discussing the question is not a little singular. He is a Bishop we suppose,, hi:^some sense, of the Church of Christ as well as the Church of the English in India. We are quite aware of the tendency to make the Secretary of State for India omnipotent in the country. But it is a little startling to us, we confess, to find the Bishop of Bombay complacently referring to this authority and that of the State, as so absolute in reference to this question of the conduct of the clergy. ' At length' his Lordship tells us ' Her Majesty's Secretary of State was appealed to' upon this subject of clerical editorship ; and he decided that, under the orders of May 11, 1853, it had been quite within the competency of this Government to deal definitively with the case : adding that ' in his ' opinion no Officers, Civil or Mihtary whether on actual ' service or on furlough, ought to be permitted to edit a ' newspaper in India without the express sanction of Go- ' vernment. With this, I was content, assured that no ' Government with any respect for itself would even by ' an act of its own accord to one of its servants a ' quasi censorship of its own official measures, and official ' men nor with any regard for religion would expose one of u its Chaplains to the peril of merging his pastoral character ' in that of the public journalist.' This is curious language. Wo should imagine that the Prelate who uttered it will take it as a compliment when we say that it marks the lowest depth of Erastian subserviency which has, so far as we know, been reached by any Bishop ot the Church since its foundation. It must be a pleasant spiritual exercise for any clergyman to read the Ordination service which bound him to the service of the altar and the Church, and then contrast it with this doctrine of servi tude to the Government in India. We observe that the title of this charge is to the clergy of the Diocese of Bombay. Surely that is not in keeping ; surely it should be ' to the Chaplains of the British Govern ment in India.' Now we have no impracticable High Church views whatever. We remember well the peculiar historical and other difficulties of the Church of England in maintaining its abstract position as part of the Church of Christ. Butwecannotbelieve that that Church will be able, consistently with its duty to its Head, to endure much longer tUs ubsoluto sun^uder of its nowers pf Government to' : ; jj — k Si 314 The Bombay Saturday Review. [ Apr: 7, isee. the State. Every body must desire to see every step well con sidered many change. In the meantime, however, we protest against this moral betrayal by a Bishop of the rightful posi tion of the Christian minister/ The service of the Church is too great a function for us to endure that it should be thus quietly put into utter subordination to an Indian executive. And we think it hard that any journal should have to protect the spiritual independence and dignity of the Church from this cool surrender of them by one of her own Bishops. It is truly extraordinary that the Bishop of Bombay should have thought it necessary to criticize the position of a news paper editor as such. It is laid down by the Bishop of Bombay that' men who have newspaper types at their command need to be always on their guard.' So we should imagine from weighty authority need Bishops, and indeed, all the sons of Adam. But we ought to be thankful to his Lordship, more thankful than the hardness of our hearts permits us to be, for the weighty cautions which he utters to the publicist and the journalist. ' Articles to serve the purpose of the hour are soon thrown off under the impulse of a passing excitement' the Bishop tells us; and we know well how right he is. It is the deplorable necessity of the journalist that he cannot allow an interval of five years to elapse between article and article, as a Bishop of Bombay can between charge and charge, Sydney Smith, in a striking passage about the advantage of human speech, says that lions too might have a society and a polity if they could meet and ' growl out their experiences' to one another. Well, the secular part of mankind takes too deep an interest in its own part of life to be able to wait so long as the ecclesiastical can, at least in India, for that ' growling out of experience' with which the Bishop of Bom bay, free equally from all excitement as from interest in his work, favours them only every five years or so. Sins of omission in high place, let us hint to the Bishop of Bom bay, are equal to sins of commission in humble place. It is most impressive to learn from the Bishop's ' own pastoral experience' that on the conscience of a dying editor the question ' shall weigh heavily how he shall give account for what has appeared in the columns of his news paper at the bar of Him who has said : By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.' But we are sadly afraid that the Bishop is as deficient in a sense of secular humour as he is in high Apostolic tendency. The notion of a peculiar Satanic quality in 4 newspaper types' is, we assure his Lordship, quite antiquated now. And it is too probable that the profane vulgar will attribute his pastoral interest in the deathbed repentance of wicked journalists to the too correct appreciation, which has occasionally been shown in editorial columns, of the amount of self-sacrifice with which the Bishop has devoted himself to his own great function. We cannot go further into a detailed criticism of the touch-and-go allusions of his Lordships to the many great subjects into which he goes only far enough to prove how little he cares for them. But a Prelate of such fixed faith as this charge evinces, will be grateful to us for removing the only shade of doubt which is allowed to appear in the midst of what is otherwise unmixed and confident dogmatism. ' May it not be reasonably feared' asks his Lordship, in speaking of Missions, ' that a far more injurious obstacle to the spread of the Gospel in this land has arisen from the contradiction exhibited by too many nominal Christians, of all communions, between what they profess to be and what they are.' We can venture to say that there is not the smallest doubt about the matter. And, if his Lordship will condescend to verify this truth, in the way that he has ascertained the peculiar spiritual dangers of Journalism, by reference to his own ' experience,' pastoral and others, he will easily conclude that no person, is so amply justified as him self in insisting on this particular impediment to the spread in India of the Gospel of sacrifice. The Bishop of Bombay asks very impressively ' how shall the lost sheep inthe outly ing world be won to the fold, if the flock of that fold are not kept within its fences.' Let us ask him, pointedly, how that is to be done if no howling of the wolves of sin and heathendom is lond enough to keep its principal Shepherd or Bishop from untimely slumber- When Bishops teach journalists their duty, it would be ungrateful not to reciprocate the kind office. It is, good of his Lordship to warn jour nalists from excitement. Perhaps it is as fwell for the journalist to warn a Bishop from fctineaniise. For the talent wrapped in the napkin was the worst invested talent of all; m ™E PERSIAN GULF AND COLONEL PELLY. (TWO letters which have appeared this week in the columns X oi a contemporary would induce us to return to the subject of the Persian Gulf, even if the great interest that attaches to the subject were not of itself enough to arrest our attention. We cannot but express our regret that matters or such importance as those which are under the considera tion of the Governments of India have not received dis cussion of a more serious kind at the hands of writers of more weight than the two absurd persons to whom we allude, who at least do themselves the justice of signing by appropriately absurd signatures. It is perhaps wrong to take notice of any letters of such intrinsic levity as those which have appeared under the signatures of 1 Eeputa- tion &gt; and ' A Respectable Land-lubber ? If people wish to receive serious attention when they presume to write upon serious subjects, they should refrain from imitating in their style and pseudonyms the broad grins of clown and pantaloon. But it is perhaps not well to disregard vilification, however ridiculous and baseless, of valuable public men in a country where editorial indulgence combines with public taste for calumny to afford the conspicuousness of large types for any communication, however worthless; provided only it assails a reputation, and strives to damage a character. The ' Eespectable Land-lubber' would have done service to the public if he had confined himself to his reasonable and sound objection to the destruction of the local Indian Navy. It is undoubted that all well informed persons in India regret and deplore this measure as one of the most foolish parts of the destructive policy which has accompanied the direct assumption of Indian Govern ment by the British Crown. If there is one thing which would be pronounced theoretically desirable, it is the posses sion by the local authorities of this country of a navy, entirely under its own controul, whose officers should be thoroughly familiar with the languages and tribes of the Persian Gulf, and of the other shores with which the people and Government of Western India needs must come into commercial and other relations. Such an instrument actually was in the hands of the Government. And in pursuit of the chimaera of amalgamation of the services, or rather, as part of the dangerous policy of absorbing all the powers of Govern* ment in England, it was broken up with culpable levity. This was, however, only a legitimate corollary of that denunciation of special aptitude, special training, special experience as necessities for Indian Government, which led to the suppression of Haileybury, and to the summary, ill considered, purely destructive reversal of all the maxims, and suppression or distortion of all the institutions, which had won this country for England. It remains yet to be seen what will be the consequences of so strange a policy. And we cannot help expressing our cordial agreement with the 4 Respectable Land-lubber'—how can any rational man sign so absurdly—when he denounces the suppression of the local navy as foolish in the extreme, and as adding seriously to the difficulties of dealing with the Persian Gulf. But we are bound to express our astonishment at the audacious ignorance of the personal attack which this person makes upon Colonel Pelly. We have nothing to do with the case of Captain Jones, except to remark that it is only in India,^ the country par excellence of petty official jealousies, and ignoble personal squabbles, that any body would care to discuss anything connected with the circumstances under which Colonel Pelly was placed in charge of the affairs of the Gulf and Captain Jones parted from them. But the attack on Colonel Pelly deserves more comment and attention, because it shows that the reputation, and the remarkable performances of this officer in the Eastern world, have failed to secure for him here the consideration which is due to him, though in England they have raised him ;o a high point of esteem. This is rather singular. It might be expected that famous exploits performed by an of ficer of the Indian service would be a subject of local pride that would cause his name to be guarded with some jealousy from those sort of people who go about the world picking up mud to throw at their fellow creatures. We are obliged to conclude that there is much less of knowledge of Colonel Pelly's career and character in London than in Bombay, For certainly in London no Editor would dream of con signing to any other part of the establishment than the waste paper basket a letter with a buffoon signature which should announce that the Colonel was an excellent chop logic, ' but wholly wanting in that personal influence and weight which go so far in dealing with Asiatics.''f 1 f Apr. 7, 1866.

Pelly. It is not too much to say that these place him at the very head of those distinguished Englishmen who have vindicated English rule by the most striking proofs of that moral weight of the individual Englishman which, as by some sort of spiritual gravitation, places the Oriental under the rule of the gentleman of English birth and training. We can scarcely hold ourselves permitted to speak of a 4 school' in connection with such a class of men of great action as of giving facilities to the malicious to depreciate them geographical progress and heroic adventure, and even in the leading events of English society, had their attention fixed upon the Colonel last year, and are well aware that the highest English social circles,—always keen to recognize the highest merit, gladly took the opportunity of showing in every way their admiration for one whose heroic career and high character, as well as intellectual merits, constituted a claim, readily acknowledged, upon the homage and esteem of the best Englishmen and Englishwomen. We can- not but think it would be better if leading Indiar journals followed so excellent an example, and helped to confirm the reputation of leading Indian worthies instead those brilliant officers of the Company, who happily com bined in their careers and characters and trainings the discipline of the soldier with the adventurousness of the knight-errant, and the chivalry of the Christian gentle man. But if we were free to do so, we should say that John Jacob of the Scinde Horse, James Outram, the Bayard of India, and, in no inferior degree, Colonel Lewis Felly's three men bound in a fast and noble friendship until two of them went to their rest, have formed, in the military history of India, a special school, whose doctrine was the moral weight of the English gentlemen with Asiatics, and whose lives and deeds were the best proof of its soundness. Of these three men, it is true that while those whom we have lost, as well as the one that remains, lived and worked and fought nnder the inspiration of this doctrine, and proved its truth in their own case at least by striking acts of leader ship over Eastern men. Colonel Pelly, by many years the junior of the three, adds to his other claims to admiration a power of literary expression which increases his value as a public man. He has known therefore how to expound with grace and force in words, as all three have done in their deeds, the doctrine of the legitimacy of English rule in India as resting on the superior moral weight of Englishman. But he has also found the way to give more striking proof in the circumstances of his own career, that some English men, at all events, may rely upon their force of character and moral weight and personal daring to go anywhere and do anything. Our space is brief and we are not writing a biography. So we can only just refer to the most important facts of Col. Felly's career bearing on the point. His ride from Teheran through AfPghanistan into India in the winter of 1860-61, in which he travelled as an English officer wearing his uniform, unarmed, and unescorted except by two or three servants, was, surely it is no exaggeration to say, the most chivalrous not to say Quixotic proof of his faith in his leading principle that the weight and daring of the English character may do any thing in the East. The British uniform had not been seen in Affghanistan since our troops retreated after burning Cabul and aveng ing our calamities in the famous expedition. No Euro pean undisguised, so far as we know, had ever succeeded in penetrating through these regions. That an unarmed English gentleman in such guise should have been suffered to pass alive through the territories of the wild chieftains, who never before suffered the tread of the undisguised European among them, and who have so much reason to hate the British name, was a truly wonderful proof of the power of moral daring to fascinate the Oriental mind. Far be from us the invidiousness of contrasting degrees of bra- very Our only reason for taking notice of this attack is to protest against this tendency to depreciation which is sc painful a characteristic of Anglo-Indian opinion. As to Colonel Felly his reputation is too confirmed in all English circles, political, aristocratic, and literary, for any foolish attacks on him to be of the slightest weight. His future career is confidently looked to as destined to be of the great! est service to the State. But it is to be regretted that no reputation, however great in England, serves to secure the requisite amount of personal consideration to Englishmen in India. Climate, and the narrowing influence of official jealousy, combine to depress the intellect of Anglo-Indians as well as their spirits. But there are cases in which the attempt to pull down your neighbour's reputation he comes too absurd to be even amusing. And when a write assails Colonel Felly's weight and personal influence with Asiatics he commits the folly of attacking on that grounc the very man who has perhaps shown these qualities more strikingly than any man in previous history. THE SOUECES OF LAND LAW 7 IN INDIA. THE Times of India is publishing a series of papers on JL Indian tenures : and the last published of these contains passages, which have produced on us a strong impression of the intellectual barbarism which as yet prevails in this country. It is not our main object at this moment to revert to the subject of the relations of the State to the land in India with a view of once more urging the necessit of creating a system of true property in the land. Wha we have at present in view is rather to point out the singula frame of mind, in a scientific point of view, with whic writers of some ability and knowledge approach this subject It was remarked on some occasion by a writer on thi subject that the discussion of land law in India perpetual!' provokes a reference to first principles. This is true fo the reason principally that, as we have insisted more thai once, there never yet has been legal private property in th land strictly speaking in India at all. Those who are at al qualified to deal with this subject cannot fail to grasj this conclusion after due enquiry. Therefore they se that, at the threshold of this great subject, they havr to deal with the great mixed speculative and practica question whether the socialist theory of dealing witl the produce of the soil only, by way of distributing i between the State and individuals, either should or can b perpetuated in India, or whether, as in Europe, private pro perty in the soil shall be definitely created. The writer of the papers in the Times of India, when he comes to deal, as he does last Wednesday, with that wonderfu But this exploit does appear and always has appeared j piece of legislation Act X. of 1859 r which is not in air to us the very ideal of heroic adventure, and as far surpass ing the glory of the battle field, as the courage of the forlorn hope does the courageof a cavalry charge. The French soldiery, keenly perceptive of delicate shades of distinction in language and conduct, give the first place in their classification of heroes to the man whom they call a brave de nuit. That is to say, one of those who can, in the darkness and unseen by sympathizing eyes, set his life on the hazard of a fight in the pure spirit of military self-sacrifice. We know no language more applicable to this exploit of Colonel Felly than to call him by this glorious title of brave de nuit. And if he wears no cross or decoration for such an achievement, it is only because such deeds are immeasurably above those ordinary sense legislation, but merely the last expression of its absolui? socialist will about the division of the produce on the pari. of the State, has a dim feeling that some of its provision require theoretical justification. He seems especially strucl with this in the case of that wonderful piece of arbitrary dealing with 4 property' which converts twelve yean ' squatting'into 4 a right of occupancy.' And it is really interesting, as showing how completely the discussion of thi.' subject is in its infancy here, to see how the writer justifie; this 4 legislation' in a philosophical point of view. The policy of it he tells us has been questioned. W r e should rather thin] that every thing about it has been questioned : the use of the terms employed : the object really in view of those who catagories of heroic or military daring for which crosses and i passed the law; its principle, and language. And everything orders have been invented, i about it will continue to be questioned, until it is seen to be But we should have thought that Colonel Felly's kindred mere barbarous, arbitrary, patriarchal ism, disguised under the exploit of last year, his remarkable journey to the Wnhabee forms of law. But our writer on 4 ' Indian tenures' has nc capital, would have been enough to protect even so foolish a suspicion of this. He has evidently been brought up in that as 'The Land-lubber' from the temptation of attack- uuii'QWschool of Indian adininistratpvs,whoare ? asarule,witIi'316 The Bombay out a knowledge of comparative jurisprudence ? or history, and are therefore not aware that English rule in India, though most beneficent in intention and execution as compared with former Governments, does not bear to be tried by any standard of European progress or scientific ideas. Nay so little are they aware of this progress and those ideas that, when they have a question of first principles to discuss, they are quite as likely as not to go to the old Indian sources and authorities, as the best possible guides for the formation of opinion, and the moulding of policy, and that too with a gravity that is charming in its na : if reliance upon old world nonsense. And, when they have done so, the simpli city with which they draw tremendous practical conclusions from exploded premises is equally remarkable. It is certain, as the writer in the Times says, that the policy of converting twelve years squatting on land into a new right requires vindication; so, ' it may be well to examine here the general principles in which the right of property itself is founded.' Now how does our legal philosopher do this? It is evidently a very great subject. And, if properly dealt with, involves not only this little corner subject of the twelve years squatting in Bengal, but the whole subject of the land law in India. Now we are not so unreasonable as to be going to quarrel with this writer for not dealing with this great subject adequately in some casual papers which it is only fair to remember are written mainly, as their title shows, to tell us of Indian tenures as they are. But what we have to notice as really curious is the perfect absence on his part of the slightest knowledge of the way in which he ought to ' examine the general principles.' That is a large design, and not necessary to his purpose of showing the tenures as they are. How does he execute it ? By an appeal to the general dicta of two writers in the ancient east and modern west respectively. First, he refers to what Blackstone 4 admits' and secondly, to what Menu the great Hindu legist declares about ' Sages who knew former times and who consider this earth' &amp;c, &amp;c. According to these ' authorities' ' the right to the use or to the pro perty of the soil proceeds from occupancy,' and so forth. This is really most amusing. Evidently the writer has no suspicion either of the worthlessness of his authorities, upon a question of scientific jurisprudence and policy, or of the extraordinary nature of his practical conclusions. Because certain legists have said, in a speculative way, that the right of property comes from occu pation, therefore it is quite right to give to twelve year squatters on lands and hereditary right to be there. ' Inas much as Menu has said' something or other about the imaginary first man who cut away the wood and cleared the land having a ' certain property'—a 4 certain property' is ludicrously like a lady's' certain age'—therefore let us now give the land to actual Bengalee squatters. Was there ever such a wonderful relation between premises and conclusion ? But we do injustice to the writer. It is not only the clearing of the land by the primal man that gives the Bengalee squatter rights now. We must really reprint the full sentence in order that people may see how this subject is discussed. ' But inasmuch as Menu has said that he who has cut ' away the wood, or cleared and tilled the land, has a cer- ' tain property therein; and inasmuch as that right is not ' likely to be acquired in fully cultivated land, without gross ' negligence on the part of the owner, it seems to us, &amp;c. &amp;c.' How you can acquire a right by cutting away the wood andclearingand tilling land when it is already fully cultivated passes us to imagine. And then the land in question already has an owner; so even if the wood was on it we do not see how the operation of clearing and tilling could give a right. This is, indeed, a strange way of ' examining the general principles.' Menu and Blackstone—curious conjunction—-are perfect ly useless as authorities on the principles of jurisprudence and their application to practical Statesmanship. The theory of a c law of nature,' which is at the base of their speculations about the origin of property, is now regarded by all scientific jurists as mere intellectual rubbish. The conception of natural rights, which is due to mere con fusion of mind, was at the bottom of the old Hindu soci alisms, and resulted in the most arbitrary and unnatural* social results, as that of caste. It is always laid down, by a curious but necessary paradox, as the basis of all ar bitrary socialist, or communist systems. Nature and her promptings are in the direction of instincts and forces. These, embodied in a state principle, give us not rights but tyranny ; not private property, but socialist con fusion. Nobody is capable of dealing with this sort of subject who cannot distinguish between the pardonable Review. [ Apr. 7, 1866. looseness of conventional colloquialism, and the necessary precision of scientific language in serious enquiry. There is no such thing as a natural right. Law and right are the results of art, not of nature, of intellectual determination, not of instinctive growth. For this reason the enquiry for practical purposes into the £ natural' origin of landed property is unfruitful even to absurdity. Property in land is either real, that is to say conceptual*, or nothing. It has nothing whatever to do with any primeval processes of clearing, which are mere facts of occupancy and labour. This can be easily seen by a little reflection. Can there be no pro perty in the uncleared land of the virgin forest ? That clearly is land which the imaginary man of antiquity never touched. Does the man who clears it get a 4 certain property' in it ? What in the name of reason is a 4 certain' property ? We should like to hear what the American authorities would say to that doctrine. The clearer of forest land in the United States gets a right of pre-emption. To him first is given the right of acquiring property in such land, a rather different thing. W T hen we find a writer on tenures in India taking Menu and Blackstone as his jurists, and talking of natural rights, the conclusion is forced upon us once again that the solution of Indian problems is not likely to receive much help from those who have had the exclusive training of Indian ex perience ; valuable and indispensable as the enquiry into that is to those upon whom in Europe the task of such solution will eventually fall. MUNICIPAL FINANCE. WE cannot help compassionating the authorities con cerned in questions of Municipal Government in their embarassment. Everything has to be done in the way of town improvement in Bombay, and the source of the neces sary funds is extremely uncertain. Under these circum stances the suggestions of the committee of the Justices in their draft report, for the imposition of transit duties upon merchandize passing through Bombay deserves to be treated with indulgence, even if it should be pronounced, on full deliberation, inadmissible. The able and energetic Municipal Commissioner wishes us to put up with what is avowed to be barbarous finance, on the ground that this is J: still a semi-barbarous country. We admit the force of the argument. But upon the whole we conceive that we must not yield to the barbarism, but steadily abide by higher principles of civiliza tion, in finance as well as other things. Besides, the question of transit duties upon the merchandise which finds its way to the world at large through Bombay is we fear a speculative one only. It is nearly certain, as has been remarked upon the subject, that the Government of India will not sanction such a retrograde measure. Among the definite moral conquests of the age in financial matters is to be reckoned a clear perception of the distinction between local and State finance. And the principle of toll is not now admissible except for the actual improvement of the road travers ed. The only serious question, upon which we feel a doubt in finally disapproving of the scheme, is whe ther the improvement of the town of Bombay may not be regarded as coming under that head of im provement of road way, for which passing tolls may with propriety be levied. We consider that this point at all events deserves serious enquiry. We will not conceal our own belief that the supporters of such tolls will find the greatest theoretical difficulty in maintaining the affirmative. Yet there are strong arguments in its favour, strong, though we think answerable. It is true that the harbour of Bombay, and the city generally, may be viewed as the only practicable adit and exit for the commerce of Western India and the world. And there is much apparent plausibility in the contention that, on this ground, the payment of a temporary toll on goods for the improve ment of Bombay would be returned by greater facilities to commerce. Whether fuller enquiry would serve to des troy or maintain this ground we should hardly like to say.
