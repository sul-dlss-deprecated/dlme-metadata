ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR 1876-77. General. 1. The following Governments and Chiefdoms are under the poli tical supervision of the Resident in the Persian Gulf: 1. Oman—Under His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. 2. Oman Coast—Under various independent Chiefs having Treaty relations with the British Government. 3. Bahrein—Under an independent Chief, Sheikh Eesa bin Ali. 4. Nejd—Under the Government of the Sublime Porte. 5. Bassidore—In the occupation of the British Government. 6. Persian Crtist—Partly under the government of Fars and partly under that of Lar. 7. Fars—Directly under the Government of Persia, which is represented by a Viceroy, whose seat of Government is at Shiraz. I.— Oman. 2. A detailed report on the territories under the government of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee has been prepared by the Political Agent at Muscat. Although several events of interest occurred during the past year nothing took place of sufficient importance to warrant the direct interposition of British authority. Petty Independent Chiefdoms. 2.— Oman Coast. 3. No changes have taken place among the Chiefs who are parties * Chiefs of Ras-el-Khymah, Ummal- to ^he maritime truce* since the date Gawain, Ejman, Shargah, Dabai, and of last year's report. They have, with Abu Zhabi. one exce p^ on an unimportant nature, faithfully fufilled their obligations to the British Government. 4. In October 1876 the Shargah Chief disregarded the advice of British authority in sending troops and munitions of war by sea to the aid of his partizans at Dibba, apparently acting under the impression that the various divisions of the Joasmee tribe possessed the privilege of affording mutual assistance to one another either by land or sea. This question is now under the consideration of Government. i • J*; i The s ettlement of the Beni Yas at Odaid, under Sheikh Butye bin Khadim, has been the cause of some trouble to the Residency. The Bern Hajir and other marauding Bedouins tribes, who reside in the neighbourhood of Odaid, but over whom the Chief has no effective power ot control have on more than one occasion obtained boats at this port, and have forcibly made use of them for piratical purposes, and during the past year some outrages at sea on peaceable trading vessels were reported.and muscat political agency tor the year 1876-77. 3 The vicinity of Odaid to the Turkish possessions on the Guttur Coast is productive of some difficulty in obtaining 1 redress for those irreg-nlarities, owing to a suspicion that any movement on the part of the British authorities might have the effect of inducing the Chief to place himself under the direct suzerainty of the Porte. There have, however, been symptoms of late that the settlers themselves are tired of the unsatis factory position they hold, and the last accounts justify a hope that a reconciliation will be effected between the seceding Sheikh and the Chief of Abu Zhabi, who has always claimed Odaid as an integral portion of his territory. 3—Bahrein. 6. These islands have enjoyed perfect tranquillity during the past year. The balance of indemnity due to the sufferers by the attack on Bahrein during the year 1869 has been paid up and settled. 7. A new pearl bank has been found north of the island, and there is a general feeling that the efforts of the divers in this quarter will result in pearls of very superior quality being discovered. 8. Fears have been entertained by the Chief that unless this loca lity is carefully watched by the British men-of-war the confusion caused by the assemblage of a large body of warlike and avaricious Arabs might give rise to a general commotion which would endanger public tranquillity. Warnings in due form have therefore been con veyed to all the Chiefs and others concerned, and every precaution is being taken to prevent a fracas, but much will depend upon the frequent presence of a vessel of war upon or near the scene of operations. 4.— Nejd. 9. No further movements on the part of the Turkish Government have been reported from Lahsah except the periodical reliefs of troops. 10. Abdullah bin Fysul still represents his family in Nejd. 5.— Bassidore. 11. This station has remained in tranquillity under the charge of Assistant Surgeon, Abdur Rahim Hakim. The Coal Agent, Hajee Abbass, was dismissed in March 1877 by the Resident's order for neglecting to attend to the Proclamations annually promulgated respect ing slave-holding. 6.— Persian Coast. 12. The districts of Persia bordering on the Gulf have been generally free from disorder. Some petty cases of wrecks sustained by Native craft have been duly attended to, and settled on the represent ation of the Government Native Agents. 13. In March 1876 a large bugla under British colors was stranded at Henjam, a dependency of the Island of Kishm, and imme diately on the receipt of the intelligence Her Majesty's Ship Arab was sent to the spot. Her presence saved the vessel from being plundered, and the Sheikh of Kishm, who had sent a number of buglas from Kishm to the scene of the accident, did no more than tow the bugla to Kishm in hopes of benefiting by her subsequently. He even tually, however, sent a deputation to Bushire to explain that his inten-4 ADM[NISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY tion was to save the vessel and carg-o, and entered into an engagement, which he has carried ont, for the restoration of all he had received. 7.— Government of Fars. 14. In August 1876 the Mo'etemid-ul-Mulk, Yahya Khan, Firman Firma, was superseded in the government of Fars by His Royal Highness the Mo'etemid-ud-Dowlah, Ferhad Mouza, an elder brother of the Hussam-us-Sultaneh, and an uncle of the Shah. 15. After the departure of Yahya Khan from Shiraz, Sultan Owauz Mouza, a son of Ferhad Mouza, who bears the title of Ihtisham- ud-Dowlah, carried on the governmental duties at Shiraz, and took energetic measures to restore order and tranquillity throughout the province. 16. On the arrival of Ferhad Mouza in September the notorious Musheer-ul-Mulk fell into disgrace, and was compelled to refund a large portion of the immense profits he was reported to have made by the farm of the Fars districts. He was bastinadoed and imprisoned, and having narrowly escaped with life, was eventually expelled from the Province of Fars, passing through Bushire, in December, on his way to Mecca. He is now supposed to be in Karbella endeavouring to obtain permission from the Shah to appear at Teheran. 17. The Musheer-ul-Mulk had gained so much influence that it was generally believed a rising of the mob in Shiraz would have followed his apprehension, but nothing of the kind occurred, and ever since his downfall perfect security has prevailed both in the city and on the caravan routes. 18. The Mo'etemid-ud-Dowlah with the assistance of the Kawam- ul-Mulk reduced in January 1877 the Fort of Tabbar. This stronghold had for a long time past defied the power of many successive Rulers of lars, and had become a general asvlum to the discontented. The Shah has marked his appreciation of the services of the Mo'etemid-ud-Dowlah and his son the Ihtisham-ud-Dowlah, by presenting a valuable iewelled sword to the former, and a kema ' or dagger to the latter.

Although the Sam- ud-CSAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOB, THE YEAE 1876-77. 5 was accompanied by a large body of troops from different parts of Persia, perfect order and tranquillity prevailed during- his stay in these parts. 22. Bunder Ahbass. —Ahmed Shah Khan of Minas, the Governor of Bunder Abbass, died in July 1876, and the Mo'etemid-ud-Dowlah gave the government to Nusseer-ul-Mulk, who, after placing his nephew there as Deputy Governor, visited that port and Lingah. 23. Postal. —A weekly postal service has been established by the Persian Government between Teheran and Bushire. The cossids call at the principal places en route, and, if properly carried out, the effect of the measure will prove of great benefit to the mercantile community of Persia. 24. Judicial. —By Notification No. 452P., dated 1st March 1877, His Excellency the Governor-General in Council appointed the Assistants to the Resident, being Christians and European British subjects, to be Justices of the Peace and to exercise also the powers of Magistrates of the 1st Class within the undermentioned territories beyond the limits of British India, viz., the whole of the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, with the exception of those portions which are under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Muscat and the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur. 25. The administration of justice over British subjects is still defective, owing to the absence of any instrument regulating and defin- ir.g the extra-territorial jurisdiction possessed by the British Crown in the maritime provinces of Persia. 26. During the year under review an attempt was made to ascer tain the number of British Indian subjects (including the subjects of Native States in alliance with Her Majesty) resident in the various ports of the Gulf. The following statement makes no pretension to complete ness, but may be useful as preparatory to a general system of registra tion, which has been prescribed by the Government of India, being carried out:— Place of residence. o o o s o Ras-el-Khymah Ummal-Gawain Ejman Shargah ... j Hamneh ... | Dabai l^Abu Zhabi Bahrein ...

Polifical. —Lieutenant-Colonel Jloss having proceeded on 18 months' furlough, Lieutenant-Colonel W. F. Prideaux took over charge of the duties of the Residency on 11th April 1876. 28. Medical. —Surgeon Wall has been relieved of the surgeoncy at Bushire by Surgeon J. C. Lucas, who assumed charge on the 29th March 1877. 29. Naval. —Her Majesty's Ships Vestal, Rifleman, Arab, Teazer, and Daphne have been employed at Muscat and in the Persian Gulf during the year under review. All these vessels, with the exception of the Vestal, have made a short stay at Busrah. 30. The Residency steamer was withdrawn in October 1876. A steam-cutter has since been placed at the disposal of the Resident, for quarantine duties in connection with the plague in Mesopotamia. Slave-trade. 31 Slave importations have been reported at Kishm and Bunder Abbass, but the local authorities have declared their inability to discuss the matter. The British Agents have been vigilant in obtaining inform ation, and Her Majesty's Ship Teazer has visited both ports for the purpose or making enquiry. Establishment. Bunder Abbass. (Sd.)

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT FOR THE YEAR 1876-77. Political.—Ai the close of the last official year His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, who had succeeded in re-establishing himself in power was eng-ag-ed in negotiations with his brother, Seyyid Abdool Azeez, with a view to the latter retiring from Oman on a suitable allowance, but all the negotiations fell through, and His Highness Seyyid Abdool Azeez who had come down to Kuriyat to meet the Political Agent, and the Minis ter, Seyyid Said returned to Semed, where he still resides. Early in the year His Highness took the bold step of seizing three Sheikhs of the Bu Hassan and Al ahibeh tribes who had become notorious for their intngues, and were the cause of many of the disturbances and disorders that had taken place of late, and confining them in the forts at Muscat. is was done at the instigation and with the co-operation of the lead ing Sheikhs of their own tribes, who, jealous of the growing authority and importance of tlieir subordinates and rivals, were glad to seize the opportunity of getting rid of them under the Sultan's name and re sponsibility Hopes were entertained by many of His Highness^ well wishers that this measure was the inauguration of a more vigorous line ot policy than had hitherto characterized Seyyid Toorkee's reign, but these hopes were unfortunately destined to be dispelled. r 1 11 1 Co 1 1 ) 0 ?.! 1 Pri J eaux ^ w bo had been appointed to officiate for to BnlS. 08 fo aS ? r ent ' l&gt;ersian (,ulf ' visited Muscat to Bushire, to make the acquaintance of His Highness Reyyid Toorkee bi^S f 0W1 !q g ''''n' ls H 'g h ness moved up to Burka with Seyyid Bedr bm Serf and a small detachment, in order to frustrate the schemes of and^onrrison of tl' , f' s ', w , ho ha&lt; J intriguing: with the Governor d Allison of that tort to make it over to him.

It was not long- before His Highness began to reap the fruits of his infatuation in letting his treacherous enemies loose, for they had no sooner returned in safety to their own country than they com menced to excite sedition and hostility against His Highness in revenge for the treatment they had undergone. In July His Highness' suspicions being aroused with regard to the conduct of his nephews, the sons of Seyyid Thoweynee bin Said^ he caused them to leave Muscat and retire to K ishm, where they have since remained. In September-Hamood bin Said el Jahafee, one of the three Sheikhs who bad been imprisoned and who had never ceased his intrigues to cause a rising, having succeeded in gathering a small following of about 150 men, came down into the Batinah by the passes near Rostak through the connivance of Seyyid Ibrahim bin Kais, and approached within a few miles of Burka, raiding and pillaging wherever he could. On the news of his approach being received, the British traders were removed from Seeb with their valuables, but whatever they left behind was plundered soon after by Hamood. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee promptly moved up to Burka to collect men to operate against the freebooters, and his force soon mustered some 600 men, but they did not show much eagerness to follow Hamood up, and preferred remaining at Burka, where they amused His Highness with promises. His Highness had in the meantime taken precautions for the security of the forts and bazaars in the Batinah, and had specially directed Seyyid Bedr of Sohar to arrange for the safety of Saham, regarding which His Highness had warning from Sheikh Saleh and which was unprotected by walls. Seyyid Bedr at first did so, but being misled by a report of Hamood having turned back, removed the force he had placed there, and Hamood, who was in fact marching upon Saham at the time arrived there suddenly and plundered the bazaar and the Indian traders of everything he could find. This success greatly elated Hamood and his followers, whom His Highness was unable to punish or retaliate upon in any way whatever. As the Indian traders in other places on the Batinah Coast now became alarmed, the Political Agent proceeded up the Coast in Her Majesty's Ship Rifleman and removed them from Mesnaah and other places where assurance was not felt of their safety. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, still at Burka, finding himself powerless to take the field, now determined to dismiss the Arabs he had collected to punish the rebels, who had retired unmolested to the Wady Maawal, where in the meantime fresh disturbances had broken out, and hostilities had occurred between the Maawal tribe and the people of Nakhl. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee having espoused the cause of the Nakhlites, Sheikh Hamood joined the Maawalis, to whom this accession of strength was most opportune. In a collision that took place shortly after between the parties, the Nakhlites were defeated and driven back with consider able loss. This check was however soon retrieved by the Nakhl men who arranged to intercept about 40 of their opponents in a pass, and cut nearly the whole party to pieces. Advantage was taken of these disorders by Seyyid Ibrahim to endeavour to make a descent upon Burka, but the Yal Saad tribe having refused to give the support he expected, he78 administration report of the persian gulp political RESIDENCY had no resource but to abandon it. By the end of the year an arrange ment was come to by which tranquillity was restored and trade resumed in the Batinah, and Sheikh Hamood was induced to return to El Shar- kiyeh by the payment of a sum of money. In December the officiating Political Resident, Colonel Prideauxj arrived at Muscat with an invitation from the Viceroy of India to the Sultan to be present at the Delhi Assemblage on the occasion of the assumption of the Imperial title by Her Majesty. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee considered himself unable to present himself, but deputed his Minister, Seyyid Said bin M'ohamed, with a suitable following, to attend on his behalf, and the deputation left Muscat accordingly on the 8th December. • On the 7th December His Highness Seyyid Salim bin Thoweynee, late Sultan of Muscat, died of small-pox in the fort of Hydrabad in Sind, where he was detained. In February 1877 His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, having reason to suspect the fidelity of Sheikh Seif bin Hamood, who had been entrusted with the charge of the fort at Soweyk, meditated hostile operations to compel him to evacuate it, but the matter was subsequently arranged by the Sheikh complying with His Highness' summons to come to Muscat. V\ ith the exception of local disturbances in the provinces of El Sharkiyeh and Oman, the country has since remained comparatively tranquil. Slave trade. During the year 1876 one cargo of 80 Abyssinian slaves is known to have been landed in Oman, having escaped the vigilance of Her Majesty's cruizers. The Sultan was unable to punish the Nakhoda, or to cause the release of any of the slaves. Naval. A survey on a large scale has been made by Captain F. S. Clayton, R. N., and Navigating Lieutenant Tully, Her Majesty's Ship Rifleman, of Khorel Hejareh, a spacious lagoon near Ras-el-Had, which had not previously been properly surveyed.

Vegetables are not prized by the Arabs, they are raised in small quantity in the interior, but are only extensively grown in the vicinity o£ Muscat and Muttrah, where the banian and seafaring population create a demand. Of animals, the camel is reared in great numbers by some of the Bedouin tribes, as the Deroo, on the borders of the desert, and the sale of these animals constitutes their chief subsistence. As is well known, the Oman dromedary is esteemed as the best breed in Arabia, and an unusually fine animal will fetch 150 dollars. Cattle are by no means scarce, but there being no convenience for grazing them, they have to be stall fed. The bulls are used in agricul ture, and are rarely killed for food as Arabs do not care for beef, and con sider it unwholesome. The animal is the humpbacked species, Bos Indicus. There are no buffaloes. Goats and donkeys are common, the latter being much exported to Mauritius. Sheep are scarce. In former days horses were largely exported from Oman to India, and there is little doubt that the trade could be easily revived were the Arabs in possession of sufficient breeding stock, and could they be assured of a good and certain market, as there are extensive pasture grounds in El Sharkiyeh and near Kuriyat, where breeding could be carried on. The chief difficulty perhaps would be in the general insecurity and disorgan ized state of the country. At present the supply of horses in Oman is extremely limited; besides those possessed by the Sultan in Muscat, I doubt if the number in the whole country exceeds two hundred. No metals whatever are now produced in Oman. There are some old copper mines near Semed and a worked out silver mine, but they are never worked. Copper used also formerly to be produced in the Island of Maseera as well as lead. Near Muscat the hills are very ferriferous but the ore is not of a quality to repay working. There is no gold. Agriculture. —The most valuable vegetable production of Oman, whether as regards home consumption or export, is the date, the cultiva tion of which, as it requires but little attention and trouble, is peculiarly suitable to the Arabs, In all the vallies and oases, the plains and fertile spots, all over Oman in fact wherever inhabitants are found (with the exception of Jebel Akhdhar), stand conspicuous the dense groves or forests of date trees. There are many varieties, of which the most excellent is the Fard; this is mostly exported, the pick of the market being taken by the Americans, who send four or five ships every year to Muscat. The trade is in the hands of one or two firms, who conse quently derive considerable profits. Other leading varieties are the Khalas and the Maseybili. The inferior kinds are known under the general name of Kash. The fructification of the female flowers is carried on very carefully, and the possession of a male palm with a good reputation, for they vary considerably in the opinion of the Arabs, is a source of much profit. The value of a date tree is from 10 to 30 dollars according to its bearing power, the average being about 25, but at Bedya in El Sharkiyeb the value of a tree is 100 dollars, owing to the fact that the cultivable soil there is limited, and the Arabs of that part are fond of investing their money in land. The fact that all the available ground near a village is covered with date palms does not exclude the cultivation of cereals, &amp;C., for the latter are sown beneath the trees. This is almost80 ADMINISTRATION HEPOJIT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY universally, tliong-h not of course exclusively, the case, as fields and small patches of cane and grain are to be seen in places. I have never seen a broad cultivated expanse of grain in Oman, though in the plains behind Jebel Akhdhar and in El Dhahireh grain is said to be raised more ex tensively than in other parts. The state of agriculture is decidedly low. I do not think wheat under the most favorable circumstances gives more than twenty-fold ; there is a white variety called lllas much cultivated. Jowaree and bailey are the two next principal grains. Sugar-cane is also a good deal grown, and a coarse sugar or goor is made from it. The neighbourhoods of Zikki and Nezira produce most. As the annual rainfall in Oman is extremely scanty, probably not exceeding in general three to six inches, the inhabitants are unable to depend on it entirely, and are necessitated to have recourse to artificial irrigation by means of wells and felejes. In the Batinah especially, and to some extent over all Oman, wells supply the water which is raised by means of the bullock and leathern bucket similarly to the system in Western India, but in Oman and other parts are to be found those valuable conduits called 'felej' by the Arabs, which are exactly similar to the well-known Karezes of Persia and were doubtless introduced by the Persians during their occupation of the country. These felejes are sometimes the property of the Ruler, but generally belong to some wealthy individual or to a company. Industries. —The industries of Oman are, as might be expected, few and unimportant, and are almost exclusively carried on by foreigners. The textile fabrics of the country are colored turbans and loongies of silk and cotton, worn by the Arabs, and largely exported to Yemen and Zanzibar. Cameleens made at Nezwa. Brown cloth made of the brown cotton called here Khodranj, and greatly worn and prized in the country; this is also largely exported. The weavers are of Persian descent, and come from the neighbourhood of Sohar, chiefly being the descendants of the old Persian conquerors and settlers. Coarse canvas for sails is also extensively made on the Batinah Coast, and is even exported to Cutch. Another industry is the preparation of dried dates called by the Arabs Bisir. The export of these to India, where under the name'^ of Kharak they are a necessary ingredient at certain Hindoo festivities, exceeds even that of pressed dates, ihe variety from which they are chiefly prepared is the Maseybili, but the Khameyzi is also sometimes emploved. The process observed is as follows: the dates are picked before they are quite lipe, and put into copper cauldrons of boiling water, where they are allowed to simmer for half an hour until a good deal of juice is extracted. On being taken out they are put in the sun for two or three days, and continually turned until they are found to be quite dry and hard, when ey are packed for export in peesh bags. The water in the boilers is removed from time to time, as it inspissates by extraction of the juice and evaporation and put aside to be fermented into liquor. The earthen- ^\aic use in man is made in the country, and potteries are to e ound m many places. The porous vessels or cooiahs for cooling wa er come 011 y iom Nakhl, the clay used being a bluish marl rmxe wi i saiu • iesc porous vessels however are inferior to those brought from Baghdad. The potters wheel is the same as that used in a a^es an coun nes. ISczwa is famous for its manufacture of copper vessels, and it appears to supply nearly all Oman with these articles. In,» « &amp; •. i- ^ AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1870-77. Jebel Akhdhar and beyond, the risk and expense of carriage cause the exclusive use of metal in lieu of earthenware, the women even being 1 necessitated to bring- water from the wells in copper vessels. The jewellery and gold and silver work of Muscat is mostly done by Cutchees and Sindians, and is very superior, the mode of ornament ing dagger and sword sheaths, especially, being peculiar to Oman. These men make large profits, as the Arabs generally are too simple and un sophisticated to comprehend the value of the work done for them. In the interior the gold and silversmiths are Arabs or Baisurs, but their workmanship is much inferior. Fisheries. —Fish are found in enormous quantities all along the Oman Coast, and form a very important article of consumption, not only to the coast dwellers, but also to the interior population; large quanti ties of salt-fish being prepared at Muscat and other towns for home consumption and exportation to India, the Mauritius, &amp;c. The fisher men are Arabs, Persians, Belooch and Socotraees, but though a successful and independent race, are looked down on by the Arabs. They are quite nomadic in their habits. In the pilgrim months many go to Jeddah in dows to fish, being induced thereto by the high prices there prevailing, and they usually return with a respectable sum as the fruit of their labour. At another time they spread themselves along the Mekran Coast salting their takes on the spot, and returning after two or three months with large supplies. The Socotraees and Mahras come to Oman for the autumn, and remain till about January. The nets used are of many kinds, but the larger fish and sharks, saw-fish, sword-fish and rays are taken with a line. In the Batinah the nets are nearly a mile long, and form the chief wealth perhaps of a whole village. As in Norway the rejected heads of cured fish are given to cattle, but they are here boiled up with date-stones, remnants of mat-bags, and other refuse ingredients into a palatable mess. Trade. The annexed tabulated statements show the statistics of the trade of Muscat and Muttrah for the past year, 1876-77. It must, however, be repeated that these returns cannot be altogether relied upon as correct. The books of the customs' farmer, from whom they are obtained, are not kept in a way to show the exact quantities of goods passing through the Custom-house, and it is to his interest to diminish the apparent trade of the port to keep competitors out of the field. The figures givon are undoubtedly much below the actuals, especially of the imports. The exports may be accepted as fairly correct. No returns are obtainable from the other ports of His Highness' dominions, where foreign trade is carried on, such as Soor and Sohar, as the Government is unable to levy taxes there. I estimate the value of the total imports into Oman at about 30 lakhs of rupees. The value of dates alone ex ported from all ports last year was probably about 20 lakhs. The trade, prosperity and population of Muscat are rapidly declining, and the town itself falling to ruins. This is due partly to the general insecurity of the country, owing to the intestine commotions which have distracted it of late years, by which trade is paralyzed, and merchants deterred from sending orders for goods in large quantities, but more directly to the operations of the Steam Navigation Company carrying the mails which8^ administration eeport of the persian gulf political residency now collects at the various ports of the Persian Gulf, the produce that for merly concentrated at Muscat before it was distributed to more distant countries. The date harvest last year, owing* to the heavy rainfall, was the most abundant that has been known for many years, and the expor tation of the fruit was in proportion, the total value being- $725,000, or $225,000 in excess of last year. Of this amount $55,000 worth went: to America. The chief import is rice. The returns show a decrease last year of $206,700; this diminution was owing in great part to the rise of prices caused by the famine in Western and Southern India. The article is imported chiefly in square-rigged vessels trading between Muscat and Calcutta. The number of these is falling off year by year. Five years ago there were 16 belonging to this port, now there are only six. The exports at Muscat are much exceeded by the imports, but taking the whole Coast of Oman, the trade is probably fairly balanced, as the produce of the country does not entirely concentrate at Muscat, but is shipped off at many places on the seaboard, and is not consequent ly shown in these returns. The customs farm was sold last year for $110,000, but of this, $10,000 was, I believe, remitted by His Highness the Sultan. (S.) S. B. Miles, Lieut.-Col^ II. B. M.'s Poltl.

Situated at the foot o£ an almost circular range of hills, Muscat presents a picturesque appearance from the sea. Hie hills which rise and fall in different places, and vary in height from 100 to 500 feet, are crowned at important points with small circular and square towers, which, together with the two forts on either side of the town with their imposing aspect, add not a little to the beauty of the picture. Oman, of which Muscat is the modern capital, and which extends from Ras Mesandum to Ras-al-Hudd, is principally a maritime province present ing an extensive tract of sea-coast with several little indentations serving as harbours. Of these, Muscat, which occupies almost a central position, is the most important one, both politically and physically. Geology. —Mr. H. J. Carter, than whom nobody has better studied the geology of the south-east coast of Arabia, has so ably and well described the geology of Muscat and the surrounding country in his geological papers on Western India, and other papers contributed to the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, that it will not be necessary for me to do more than glance at the composition and struc ture of tue rocks, surface soil and subsoil, in their relation to climate and to the influence they exert in the causation of disease. The rocks which surround Muscat on all sides but the small portion exposed to the sea, and which form as it were a high wall round the town, present a branched appearance, the ramifications in two places being so marked and prolonged as to give an appearance of the whole valley being divided into three minor ones. One of them is occupied by the walled town, the one to the south leads to Sadab, and the one to the south-west contains patches of fertile ground and the wells which supply water to the town. Ihe shape of these rocks is mostly conical, and their elevation varies fiom 100 to 500 feet. Mr. Carter considers them to have an igne ous origin, and to belong to the nummulitic series. They are composed prmcipa y o a dark brown coloured serpentine, everywhere bounded and overcapped with a yellow limestone formation. Mr. Carter has thus summed up his description of this limestone formation— i ' Tl vr th ? } i ™ stone formation, limiting the group of igneous wiflf 1 1' U £ fi' 1 110r ^ 1 sou th, commences (from below upwards) ^ ^ ^md of pebbles lying in both places on the siliVn-pnU n)C V 0 i loGahty, passing into a sandy grit, then into rn „i„ fi ' ^rcous eposit, then presenting the remains of marine ani- increasincr 1 nurn ^ or the calcareous material; the a T)inl colonel t 1 J 1 ™ 8 * 0116 interrupted in each instance by coWini of tt ? 0S ^ ^ 1 ? aS GhisSa ( SOuth o£ Muscat ) Chiefl - V tion at Dei'zit (north'of MusS f ' f ram, . , ; 1 . fera ' a . nd the fo ™ a - and arpnappnnc! cfmfn . +i ' ' a ^ m seri es of gypseous, marly, stone (presenting a varietToVsTr^ y f l0Wi f\ 0r fawn - coloured lirne ' at both ulaces arir! nlm I I s an&lt; ^ corals) terminating the series of the polythalmous animals!' 1 ' 0 7 COmposed of the accumulated remains inwards anfltav^ ^WgeTacfon f0Urtee ' mi i es fl0m Muscat ^e wact ot low sandy plain called Batna, whichAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 187G-77. 97 is full of date groves and large patches of cultivated land. All the hills and greater portion of the plain in and around Muscat are devoid of vegetation. The surface soil in the town is composed chiefly of sand and limestone, whilst the subsoil is formed of detritus below which the conglomerate exists. In the valley of Tuyan the surface soil, excepting in the cultivated patches, is composed principally of detritus, the subsoil being formed principally of the conglomerate. Herbage and date trees are limited to the few small patches of cultivated land in Tuyan, whilst no brushwood exists either in or near Muscat. From the colour and nature of the rocks, and from the composition of the surface soil, it will be readily seen how great is their power for absorbing and retaining heat, and how slowly the beat is radiated from them, especially during the summer months. Climate. —The climate of Muscat may be considered to be extreme and equable, that whilst the amplitude of the yearly fluctuation is great, the non-periodic variations are very slight, in which respect it is an exception to the general rule of an extreme climate being at the same time an excessive one. The reason of this is that during the greater part of the year the temperature runs high or low according to the season, gradually and steadily, without any special conditions, such as clouds, rain, evaporation and great and rapid radiation from the earth, to influence its normal course. In the months of June and July, how ever, when the hot, dry wind blows occasionaly from the west, there is a rapid change of temperature in a few minutes, the difference some times amounting to as many as 15° of Fahr. The solar thermometer indicates an annual variation of about SB'S deg. of F., the highest mean point between 170 and 175° F. being generally reached in the month of September or October, and the lowest mean point between 145° and 150° F. in the month of January or February. The diurnal variation is slight, excepting when the sky is cloudy and the direct rays of the sun have little or no efPect on the thermometer. The effects of this excessive heat of the solar rays on the human body can not be easily estimated, as with it generally exist two other conditions which may seem to have a neutralizing influence. The highest tem perature in the sun has always been registered with a hot dry wind, when the rapid movement and constant change of air surrounding the body, and the rapid evaporation from the surface must to a certain ex tent counterbalance the pernicious effects likely to follow an exposure to such a high temperature. The Sedee and other boatmen who ply their canoes between Muscat and Muttrah, fully exposed to the direct rays of the sun, with hardly any protection to their heads or backs, have not been known to suffer from insolatio, nor am I inclined to believe that the mild cases of fever which present themselves at the hospital during the hot season are essentially different from those of a malarial nature; in some the cold stage is absent, but this is not a very uncommon occurrence even in marked cases of ague, and quinine acts as beneficially in them as in the case of malaria. These cases are not to be confounded with another class of cases with almost the same febrile symptoms, but which occur principally during the prevalence of the hot and dry winds; this I am in clined to look upon as a premonitory stage of insolatio, and I have found small and repeated doses of quinine o£ great service during this stage. N98 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY This excessive solar beat exerts also an indirect influence by beatino- the surrounding rocks to a very high degree ; and, as owing to their geolo^i- cal nature and colour they absorb heat rapidly and radiate it slowly, the surrounding atmosphere is kept at a high temperature for many hours after the sun has set, rendering the heat at night almost as unbearable as that during the day. The temperature in the shade has a great annual rano-e, but the diurnal variation is slight. The highest temperature registered has been 104 o b. and the lowest o3 b.j but these are the two greatest extremes, and have occurred under the exceptional circumstances of a hot, dry wind and a strong cold north-west wind attended with rain. The average maximum temperature may be stated to be 83-8 0 F., and the average mini mum 77-8 0 F., giving a mean of 80-8 o F. The hottest months of the year are May, June and July, and the coldest December, January and February. The exhausting eifects of a continuously high temperature during five months, especially on the nervous system, may be easily ima gined; if to these we add the effects of great humidity when the south west monsoon blows, and those of a highly rarified condition of the atmosphere when the hot and dry wind prevails, causing a diminution in the quantity of oxygen inhaled, and thus retarding the regressive metamorphosis of tissues, we have the sum of the general influence of the hot season m Muscat on the constitution. The hot, dry wind whose temperature generally varies from 99 0 F. to 104 o F., and which blows direct from the great Arabian desert, occasionally induces premonitory symptoms of msolatio, whilst the damp wind, which blows over from the sea charged with moisture almost to saturation, with a comparatively lower temperature, has a depressing influence on the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. mnnf r f h % m T linraUm ™hich generally occurs about the Ami rrf a l n an m)favora1)]o influence, especially on the been nnH V^ 11 ' ihebod J' which during the previous months had atHok nf T d . e P re f ing m ^ Ce 0f t,ie 1,eat ' becomes n ow liable to The Avnl eY01 ' am 'uternal congestions are not uncommon, health^ tb^^f n ff ^ believ e that the hot weather is decidedly whilst thnciP f ^ effects of heat being gradual and insidious, remittent fWp H ^ culminati ^ ^ an attack of ague oi^ are mo™ ^ '-r, spleeu o f lungs, season 1)ut^'exepnfi!! m '^^mosphere varies according to the variation is slio-hf Tl ' ' U1 , \ Cre ^ . a a,K ^ dry shumal, the diurnal ]00) occurs abonV tl e ^ iea ^ s ^ ^lative humidity 77 (saturation being JUUj occuis about the months of July and August when the south west monsoon blows • an rl t-V. a loocf i /■ i -7? en tne soum with a hot and dry stuma/ relatlve hu ^dity generally m June s is thl u ^rvr lation or being greatest when the Xt'™Lm!Tity t\e^ e ™gh^ ^ very oiinressive^-'■'' r ', n ^ certain months makes the atmosphere Zn 'TmpS and ^^ - system becomes depressed; still thisAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY VOR THE YEAR 1876-77. 99 amount of saturation is not so injurious as it mig-ht be with a lower tem perature. The hot and dry shumal, although agreeable to some people, seems to produce so excessive an evaporation as to lead to some physiological change in the nerves and vessels of the skin and to a sudden cessation of perspiration, raising the temperature of the body, and inducing symptoms of insolatio. Chronic and muscular rheumatism seem to be greatly favored by the moist atmosphere, whilst malarious fevers prevail to a much less extent during the hot season than at other times of the year. The prevailing winds are from the north-west, and south-east, but it often blows from the north-east and west, the wind gradually veering to south-east or north-west. In the summer months the north-west and west are very hot and dry winds, and prevail to a less extent than during the winter months. From October to March or April the north-wester is cold, sometimes cutting, and is generally attended with rain and heavy dark clouds. The south-east wind generally prevails during the time the Indian south-west monsoon lasts, and is occasionally accompanied with rain and light clouds; it is very damp, and is often attended with thick hazy weather and a heavy dew at night. The north-east wind is always cool, and is neither so moist as the south-east, nor so dry as the hot season north-west. The range of barometric pressure is slight, the greatest variation during the year being 33; and there is generally a permanent depression during the months of May, June, July and August, the pressure increas ing again with the setting in of cold weather. The/average barometric pressure is about 29'95. It seems to be little affected by any sudden change in the weather, and gives no warning of any approach of a storm. The total average rainfall during the year is about 6 inches, but this quantity is sometimes exceeded, thus in the year 1875-76 the total rainfall was nearly 121 inches. It generally falls about the middle of July in summer, when it is slight and rarely exceeds an inch and a half, and during the months of November, December, January and February in winter, when it accompanies the north-west monsoon, and is about 4 inches. The rainfall in summer has a very beneficial influence in clearing the atmosphere and reducing its temperature by some degrees, whilst it moderates the force and severity of the hot and dry skunml. The cold weather rainfall is generally followed by malarial fevers; but there seems to be no direct relation between them, beyond the probability of the rain being an exciting cause, and reducing the tempera ture of the body to favor the absorption of malarial poison. Slight shocks of earthquake are occasionally felt at Muscat. Since 1873 two have occurred, lasting on an average two seconds, the direction of the wave in both cases being from the north. From the above general account of the climate of Muscat it may be seen that there are only two seasons, the cold and the hot/ each lasting about six months. The cold season, which generally lasts from October to March, and is attended with rain and heavy stormy weather, and a cold searching wind from the north and north-west, may be considered an unhealthy one. During this season malarial fevers100 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY prevail to the greatest extent, and are often complicated, thoug-h mildly with cong-estions of the spleen and liver. The early part of the hot season may be considered to be about the healthiest time of the year • but when that season is fairly established, the system suffers from general depressions and malaise; and during the prevalence of the hot and dry shumal insolatio is apt to occur. Water supply. —The valley of Tuyan to the south-west of the town contains a number of wells from which it derives its name. The wells are mostly deep and sunk in the conglomerate formation, which here as well as in the town, forms the subsoil; they supply water to the town and the small hamlets in the neighbourhood. The quantity thus supplied has always been considered sufficient, both for domestic and drinking pur poses; and even in the hottest weather no fear is entertained of the supply being unequal to the demand. The water is generally brought into the town by negroes in masuks on their backs; and the water of one large well, which is guarded by a small fort for military reasons, is conducted into the town by means of an aqueduct; this water, not being considered fit for drinking, is generally applied to bathing and washing purposes and lor the use of animals. Beside these wells there are two or three in the town itself, the water they supply being rather indifferent; they are not much used at present, but in the event of a long seige, they are the only- source of water the town has to depend upon. I regret not hayirg had the means to analyse the water chemically, but from the general physical qualities the water supplied for drinking purposes may be considered good.

Scurvy has been observed prin cipally amongst the pearl-fishers, who have to live a greater part of the year on dates and dried fish, and also amongst Indian pilgrims on their way back from Mecca. Sanitation. —Considering the general character of the people, their ignorance of some of the simplest and most essential hygienic laws, and their great aversion to innovations of any kind, it is not to be wondered at that there exists no public system of sanitation in Muscat or the neigh bouring towns and hamlets. Notwithstanding this, most of the large streets generally present a respectable appearance, are clean and free from any offensive odour, which is to be attributed entirely to the practice which obtains amongst the Arabs principally, both inside and outside the town, of cleaning the portions of the streets in the immediate neighbourhood of their houses. The Beloochees, on the contrary, would seem to take a delight in raising mounds of dirt and filth of all kinds in the imme diate vicinity of their habitations, and as all their little hamlets are built within an easy reach of large and open graveyards, for which they seem to have a particular liking, the air around and inside their huts is extremely vitiated, and the stench almost unbearable, especially m close weather. The conservancy outside the town is of the most primitive nature, but owing to the great heat of the sun and its power of rapidly drying up the excreta, it does not seem to affect the health of the people in any particular way. Inside the town the system of cess-pits exists, the stink from which, when the air is stao-- nant, is offensive and injurious. They are occasionally opened up for the purpose of cleaning and disinfectants, such as common salt and lime, put in. In some houses a large quantity of ashes and salt are thrown into the pits every or every other morning. This large accumulation of decomposing excrementatious matter in the subsoil would lead one to suppose that it would be a fertile source of disease inside the town, but that such is not the case is due^ in a great measure to the wells' which supply the drinking water, being situated outside the town, and also to the fact of the ground-floor rooms of most of the houses in the town being generally uninhabited. In Muttrah this cess-pit svstem does not exist; conservancy there is either of the primitive nature mentioned before, or the close proximity of the sea renders the immediate removal or excreta more practicable. Fop u la t ion .—Owing to the maritime position and importance of Muscat, and its being the modern capital of the province of Oman its population presents great variety and fluctuation. Politically and com- mercially speaking, Muscat may be supposed to include the large town of Muttrah, with its spacious harbour and the villages and hamlets in its neighbourhood, and the small towns of Kalbu, Riam and Sadab There are no means of determining the exact population, but it may be roughlv guessed to be about 40,000. This number may be considered to be the , population, but there is a constant fluctuation which is principally observed amongst Bedouin-Arabs and Indian and other pilgrims. ,, Of the fixed population, by far the largest portion is composed of he African races, and the mixed race of Africans and Arabs, the former being pnnc.paUy represented by Negroes, whose number may be stated to exceed ten thousand. I he pure Abyssmians are few in number, compared10^ ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY with any other class, owing- probably to their having become gradually absorbed into the Arab race; the slaves generally imported from Abys sinia being- o£ the female sex, their progeny by their Arab masters, as in the case of other slaves, has been considered Arab, although as a race it ought to be considered distinct from the real and original Arab stock owing to certain peculiarities of constitution and physcial appearances. A few Nubians too form a part of the fixed population of Muscat. The Sedee or Negro, although hardy and capable of undergoing a great amount of exertion, is characterised by the same frivolous nature and lightness of heart as everywhere else. Generally engaged in menial occupations and as laborers and workmen, the men seem to maintain a good state of health up to the age of about 40, when the decay of both physical and mental power seems to be rapid and out of all proportion to the previously flourishing condition. The women, to whose lot generally falls the easier portion of domestic work, are less subject to disease. Chronic muscular and articular rheuma tism seems to be a common complaint with the Negroes after a certain age; this may be attributed partly to their being more exposed than any other class to the sudden changes of weather, and amongst men prin cipally to gonorrhoea. The Abyssinian, naturally more delicate and of the same low degree of physical and nervous staminas in his own native country, is less able to withstand the effects of climate and disease than his neiyliboui the Scdee. lioth men and women, but the latter more paiticulaily, seem to have dormant in them from an early age, those conditions ofc blood, which under the influence of any exciting cause, such as an exposuie to sudden changes of weather, imperfect ventilation of dwellings, or mental shock or grief, especially as the result of bad tieatment from masters and others of whom thev may be very fond, give rise to phthisis pulmonalis and other tuberculous diseases. The mixed lace, composed principally of the different degrees of admixtme between the Arab and the Negro, and the Arab and the Abys sinian, forms a considerable class, although not considered by the Arabs as essentially distinct from themselves. Their number may be supposed to exceed lo thousand. The Arab Negro, although he inherits a portion of the physical vigour and hardihood of his mother, is a weaker being, and is more subject to disease. The Arab Abyssinian, whose regularity o ca uies am anguid expression of countenance betray the Abyssinian blood, would seem to be peculiarly liable to phthisis pulmonalis, which m his case is generally of a chronic nature, and extends over years. He is both physically and mentally weaker than either of his parents, and his progeny seems to be short-lived, rarely extending beyond the taLrplace 01 ^ eneratl01 b unless fresh admixture with Arab blood PvnPoTpd S A ff elem ® nt is re markably small, which is as might be expected under the existing social and domestic customs.

They attend very scrupulously to personal hygiene and being less exposed to the causes of disease than the workino- classes maintain tolerably good health during the greater part of the year. Their women, however, are generally pale and anoemic, from a want of physical exercise and from being compelled to lead a sedentary life owing to their seclusion They suffer from ague, but probably not more than any other class; still, owing to their lower vitality, the ancemic induced by ague seems to be greater amongst them than amongst others. Functional diseases oi the uterus and sterility are very common, whilst hysteria is much less common than might be expected. The Bedouin Arabs, who fonn a part of the fixed population of Muscat, are rather limited m number, rarely exceeding 500. They are a healthy race, and have great physical vigour and power of endurance. Impotence would seem to be a common disease with them, and in fact with all Bedouins that visit Muscat. The causes of it are to be sought m the pernicious habits in which youths in many of the Eastern countries are allowed to indulge. The Beloochees, who live in Muscat and Muttrah, and form not an unimportant part of the fixed population, may be estimated to be about o, 0, and may be said to be, to a certain extent, acclimatised to the place ; most of them lead an active life, either in menial capacity or as laborers, and as a rule are a healthy race. Chronic ophthalmia and skm diseases, due principally to a want of personal cleanliness, prevail to a great extent amongst them. The Khojias, who form an important section of the commercial community of Muscat, are distinguished from their co-religionists and neighbours by their weakly physical frame and their scrofulous appear- + / ! ei . r nurnl)e 1 1 : be rou 8 ,lll y stated to be about 1,000; they live at Muttrah in a small fortified place of their own, which is remarkable for its absolute want of any sanitation. They are thus socially distinct and separated from the rest of the Mahomedans. They suffer considerably irom the effects of heat during summer, and had their occupation, which is principally that of shop-keepers and merchants, been of a nature to expose them to the direct rays of the sun, insolatio would not be as un- common as it is now amongst them. Their women, who lead a sedentary sort ot life, are ancemic, and suffer considerably from functional diseases ot the uterus and hysteria. Phthisis pulmonalis is very common amongst both the sexes, and is easily accounted for by the almost total absence ot ventilation in their houses, which are generally overcrowded and the great want of sanitation in their fortified town. The Khoiias as a rule are a prolific race, and the overcrowding, to which they seem so vo untarily to submit themselves, is almost unimaginable. I say volun tarily, because nothing would be easier than for many of them either to build a new fortified enclosure so as to ensure sufficient accommodation or to segregate themselves and live amongst their neighbours, the Beloo chees and Arabs at Muttrah. Anoemia and scrofula seem to characterise most ot the principal diseases they suffer from. The Banians live inside the town of Muscat, and remain religiously and socially aloof from the rest of the inhabitants. Their number may e estimated to be about 500. They are pure vegetarians as in their own country, and although physically weak, maintain good health duringlot ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY the greater part of the year. In winter, like the rest of the population, they suffer from ague; and in the hot season the effects of heat tell more on them than on any other class, which may be partly due to the badly ventilated rooms they live in. They generally lead a sedentary life, their occupation being like that of the Khojias principally of shop-keepers and merchants. The effects of climate would seem in their case to lead to premature decay and old age. The Jutts, or Zatoots, as the Arabs call them, form a class by them selves, and are the descendents of the Jutts who emigrated a thousand years ago from India. Although Mahomedans, they are looked down upon by their co-religionists as a degraded class, and are thus kept socially to themselves. They are divided into Arab Zatoots and Beloochea Zatoots, and their total number may be computed to be about 200. A few Persians, about 100, live permanently in Muscat; some are in the service of the State as gunners, whilst others are fishermen and small traders. Of the unfixed portion of the population, the Bedouin Arabs and pilgrims to Mecca from India, Persia, Afghanistan and Central Asia, are the only two important classes. The Arabs from the interior seek relief principally for impotence, rheumatic pains, and hypertrophy of the spleen. Amongst the Indian pilgrims, the Bengalee, whose system seems to be highly charged with malaria, suffers perhaps more than any other class of pilgrims. Scurvy and scorbutic diseases induced prin cipally during the voyage from Jeddah or Aden to Muscat, or from India to Muscat, prevail most commonly amongst the Indian pilgrims. Scorbutic and anoemic ulcers are also very common, and other skin diseases, such as pruritus and eczoema may be traced to a great want of personal cleanliness. . dwellings and Streets.—^ well-to-do classes live in houses built pimcipally of mud and sandstone, with a small court-yard in the centre; the houses are square shaped and have no compounds attached to em. I he rooms are built generally in a square form round this com -yai , most of the houses are one-storied, the lower rooms being occupie eit ler by servants or appropriated for warehouse purposes.

The streets in the bazaar opposite the Banya quarter are covered over with matting so as not to admit the rays of the sun; and in conse quence the ventilation in the bazaar is hig-hly defective. Owing to the narrowness of the streets, and the closeness of most of the houses, the ventilation is generally very indifferent, and light is sparingly admitted into some of the by-lanes. The heat during the hot weather is very oppressive, and walking, even a short distance, in the middle of the day becomes an unpleasant task. At Muttrah, and in the Khojia quarter in particular, the lanes are very dirty, and unpleasant and offensive smells are not uncommon. Prevailing diseases. —The general type of disease observed at Muscat and in the surrounding country is what may be supposed to be peculiar to the zone of tropical disease realm, being more or less characterised by the great prevalence of malaria and its effects. In this respect a close resemblance may be seen to exist between the principal diseases of India, and those that prevail here, although the degree or intensity of the malarial poison in the two places differs to a great extent. Malaria and malarial fevers. —The cold season, which extends from October to about the end of March, may also be termed the malarious season, from the great prevalence of ague, and other diseases dependent on malaria for their cause. The poison as known by its effects is either of a milder nature or much less in its intensity than that observed to prevail in most districts in India; thus ague, the most common form of disease it causes, is generally observed here to be of a mild type, lasting on an average about 48 hours (including the period of intermissions) ; most easily yields to treatment and is least liable to be complicated with other diseases. Although itself an uncomplicated disease, it seems, however, to stamp other diseases with its own nature; thus inflammatory fever as the result of a wound often assumes a periodic type. No class of people seems to be altogether exempt from it during the malarious season, although the Sedee, the Beloochee, and the Bedouin Arab seem to suffer less from it than others. The Khojia and the town Arab, on the contrary, suffer most from it and its effects. Remittent fever is rather uncommon; but when it does occur it is generally uncomplicated and of a mild type. Bilious remittent and remittent with typhoid symptoms are almost unknown. Hypertrophy of the spleen does not seem to be so common as might be expected; a few cases occasionally present themselves, but they are more of the nature of temporary congestion, yielding rapidly to large doses of quinine. Brow ague, observed principally amongst the ancemic Arabs and Arab women, is rather a common disease. Considering the physical appearance and geological nature of the country, it would not seem easy to account for the prevalence to such an extent of malarious diseases. The atmospheric conditions that seem to be most favorable for their production and prevalence, are a low temperature of the air, and a wind blowing from the north-west, both of which must be combined to produce the greatest amount of influence they thus exert. It has been almost constantly observed that ague begins to prevail at the setting in of the cold season, when the wind o106 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY from the north-west is the most prevalent one, and that it begins to cease about the middle of March or beginning of April, when there is a decided change in the season, and consequently in the direction of the most prevailing wind. r lhus in investigating the source of malaria, it would seem that the poison is not of a local origin, but that it is evidently blown over from some distance in a direction which would correspond with the prevailing wind of the season. When considering the ffeoW ot the place, the Batinah Coast was mentioned to be a low-lyino' sandv plain a few miles to the north-west of Muscat, and full of vegetation fhpn • / 1 'i VeS ' P ; ,ob ? bl7 I? 01 ' 6 tlie malaria is originally generated, and en earned onwards by the strong current of the wind.

Cholera has undoubtedly prevailed in former years in a severe epidemic form. The first epidemic during this century that I have been able to find a trace of, was in 1821, when it prevailed generally all over the Persian Gulf. It was one of a very severe type, and is perhaps the one to which Dr. Aitken alludes in his ' Science and Practice of Medicine' (4th Ed., p. 636) — ' AVhen the cholera reached Muscat, instances are given in which only ten minutes elapsed from the first apparent seizure before life was extinct.' Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger in his a Narrative of a voyage round the world during the years 1835, 1836 and 1837,' quoting the Asiatic journal for 1822 as his authority, says, that 'in June 1821, when the cholera carried off 10,000 of the Sultan's subjects, the heat was almost unsupportable, and the wind was like a flame of fire. At midnight the thermometer stood at 104°.' The occurrence and severity of this great epidemic are further confirmed by the following passage from the ' History of the Imams and Seyyids of Oman by Mahummad ibn Ruzit,' translated by George Percy Budger, Rli.G.S : 'This year, A.H. 1236 (A.D. 1820-21), a plague broke out in Oman, and proved fatal to a great many. This plague differed from that which occurs at Constantinople, at Damascus, Baghdad and El-Busrah. It first attacks a man's abdomen, and then matter is ejected from the mouth and the anus until he dies. Some who are seized die at once; others after two or three days; and only a few survive. Great numbers in Oman fell victims to it.' This undoubtedly settles the point of the disease having been cholera, and of the severity with which it attacked the population of Muscat and Oman in general. No authentic record can at present be discovered of any epidemic since the one of 1821; but the disease must have pre vailed at other times. From the statements of the people it would seem that an epidemic of cholera prevailed in Muscat about 20 years ago; and the late Mr. Rozario, formerly in medical charge of the British Agency here, mentions in his account of Muscat that ' the last time it visited Muscat was in the summer of 1865.' Muscat has undoubtedly been entirely free from the disease since then; but the sanitation being so very defective, some of the principal predisposing causes are always in existence, and the introduction of the specific poison will excite an epidemic of great virulence and severity. Dysentery is rather an uncommon disease, and is principally limited to Indian and other pilgrims in whom a scorbutic taint is often observed. The disease is generally of a mild type, and easily cured by means of ipecacuanha. The specific type known as scorbutic dysentery is very rare, and never observed amongst the fixed population. Scurvy is principally observed amongst the pearl-fishers, who have to live a greater part of the year on salt-fish and dates, and amongst the Indian and other pilgrims on their way to or back from Mecca. The fixed population is generally exempt from the disease, which is due in a great measure to the use of fresh limes and vinegar they make.108 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Rheumatism. —The acute form of articular rheumatism is almost unknown, but chronic forms and muscular rheumatism are very common Both the Arabs and Sedees seem to be more subject to the latter than any other class.

Amaurosis and other diseases of the posterior structures of the eyeball are very rare. Diseases of the shin also are very common, and like those of the eye, present a great variety. The principal forms are eczoema, pruritus and other diseases dependent on fungus parasites. They are mostly observed amongst the Beloochees, and the unfixed position of the popula tion, being often the result of great personal uncleanliness. Leprosy as seen in the town of Muscat itself would seem to choose for its victims only the Negroes and the mixed race of Negroes and Arabs; the disease is generally of the tubercular variety, and prevails comparatively to a small extent. Ulcers are common and are observed principally amongst the pil grims and other portions of the unfixed population; they are mostly (ff a constitutional origin, the system being generally tainted with scorbutic, or syphilitic cachexia. Anoemia and malnutrition tissues are also some of the pathological conditions in which they are observed. Dracunculus is unknown in Muscat; cases of the disease are occa sionally observed in the hospital, but the history of every case has hitherto established the absence of the worm in or near Muscat. It is often contracted in India or in Persia, and as the worm generally takes nearly twelve months for its complete development, the disease may be seen here when the worm is about to make its exit out of the body. Venereal diseases. —Gonorrhoea of a mild form is rather common amongst the Negroes, and is seldom attended with the usual compli cations of the disease. Gonorrhoeal rheumatism of the muscles is, how ever, not an uncommon disease, and often sets in some time after the discharge from the urethra has ceased. Syphilis. —There is almost a total absence of the primary infecting chancre, the disease in almost every case having been contracted some where else. Secondary syphilis and syphilitic cachexia are generally observed amongst the Persians and Indians, as the result of the primary disease contracted in their own countries.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000358.0x0001fe_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/V/23/29, No 138</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000358.0x0001fe</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/V/23/29, No 138</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Report on the administration of the Persian Gulf Political Residency and Muscat Political Agency for the years 1876-77.’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1877/1877</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-31T02:22:23</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>57 folios</extent><extent>The report is arranged into five parts (I-V).
