March 26, 1939. AN ARMY OF SPADES Scholar Autocrat of 3,50,000 Men. Unobtrusively, without attracting much atten tion from the public, a well disciplined army of spades has grown up in India. Seven years after its start, it now boasts of *,000 centres spread all over India with a membership of 3,50,000. The members of this army of spades are Known as khaksars. They carry spades as their emblem because carrying arms is forbidden by law. Khaksars wear uniforms that could hardly be distinguished from military uniform; their officers haxs have ranks much on the same lines as an army and in fact the titles of the officers of various grades have been bodily lifted from the picturesque Urdu phraseology that is current even today in certain Indian States. THE FOUNDER Meet its founder, a lama Inayatullah Mashraxi. He gave up a Rs.2,000 a month Government of iiiuia job, 16 years before he was uue to retire, so that he coulu serve his fellow se ngs in his own fashion by starting this movement. Perhaps it will be easier for the scholarly world to remember him if it is recalled that he is the Cambridge student who took that famous seat of learning by storm some 25 years ago by successively passing four trips one year after another with first class honours. Orientalists the world over will recognise in him the person who was invited to preside over the Inter national Congress of Orientalists at Leyden in 1932.Loaders of religious thougiit will also remember him sr president of the World Conference of Religions held some time bacJc at Indore in India, Seeing a middle aged man with a dark shining beard, a typical example of contented middle class Muslim gentry of the Punjab, one would hardly believe that this unostentatious person, a notability among the scholars fothc world, is also the supreme commander of 3,50,000 khaksars. I recently met him when he visited Karachi after attending a camp of Sind Khaksars in a village in the interior where they practised mock warfare on an extensive scale. He told me why he started the movement and why he adopted the spade as an emblem for the knaksars. On account of his academic distinctions, he had been appointed Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Educational department. He rose from rank to rank till ne became director of Public Instruction in the North West frontier Province. Tuen he voluntarily retired from service 16 years before he was due, because he was disappointed with all the movements in India which he felt were widening the gulf between the Hindus and Mussalmans. He started the khaksar movement with peace, amity and brotherhood as its watchwords. It is open to all communities. It renders service to all without distinction of caste, creed or race. The movement hP.s made greatest headway in the Muslim provinces of the Punjab, Sind and the North Western Frontier Pi'ovincc. The khaksars honour the leaders of the Congress. The present President of the Congress (Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose ) must hc.ve leocivcd a formal salute fx'om the khaksars on many occasions during his term as President. 1 Hesitate3 I hesitate to cailithc Khakoars a Fascist move ment, because its founder was emphatic that it was not a political movement at all, despite its apparent military nature. He was emphatic that it was social and a religious motevemt - religious not in the sense that it favours followers of one faith to another, but in the sense that it seeks to enable its members to live upto the tenets of their respective faith in better way. AUTOCRATIC In one respect, in its abrogation of things democratic, it goes a step further then Fascism, ^he founder of the kahksars movement does not believe in democratic forms of government. He feels that they may be good for Western countries, cut that uhey are not suitable for India, He prefers a benevolent autocracy. He does not believe in elections and ther is no place for them in the khaksar movement. There is an officer, called salar over every 20 oi'dinary members, another above him is sar-salar and there are saiar-i- ala and ealar- i-ajibar while the orovincial commander is called nizam- i-aia. But all these appointments are mauc by head quarters where the supreme authority is vested in the founder himself who has been give the colourful Urdu title of Irjara Aliyyah Hindiyyah. The hes.dquarters, at the village of Ichra near Lahore, also brings out a weekly paper, the organ of the party, which is reputed to have a circulation of 15,000 bopios. In this paper gazetted new appointments, transfers changes and any expooits or acts of bravery of individual jehaksars are chroni cled. tA&amp;Ao&amp;fraKlaakoara have to pay no subscription. In this respect, they perhaps differ from all other political organisations in India. But they have to meet the coot -their uniforms, which is suhstancial, cousiueiing the tip-top military style m wncin they nave to present themselves on drills and ceremonial occasions. The head officer in charge of a camp meets the camping cost and levies a small fee ior its occupation from individual khaiesars, who ha.ve to bring their own dry food with them* Sympathisers may donate voluntary contrioutions, and gifts so far made to the supreme commander of the movement amount to nearly IV lajchs of rupees by way 01 property and cash. triple; significance The soade emblem has a triple significance* The soade is a typical implement of labour and its adoption signifies the dignity ol labour. It has a religious significance also, and to explain it the founder quoted to me a piece of Muslim scripture which is described now the Prophet broke with a spade an obstructing rock in the Battle of the hitch pronouncing that with his spade he broke the might of three empires. And thirdly a spade is a very useful impliment. The founder recalled an occasion in 1933 when 300 khaksars uassed to days and a night in waiotdeep water and by piling up sand bags stayed the onrush of the flooded river Ravi near Lahore so that neighbouring property worth lakhs of rupees was saved. So far the movement has been very peaceful. It has keot itself scrupulously out of politics, except for honourific and volunteer duties at political conferences and similai' iunctions. So far it nas oeen unostentatious, but it iswmmm )? -5- io difficult to anticipate its future progress. One tiling is certain; buch a disciplined force of as many as 5,50,000 - and it is growing every gg,y -• ig Dound to play an important part some day in India where discipline is yet a valuable quality met with but infrequently in public life, M.P.G.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Depariment, Confidential EXPRESS LETTER /-\ [2V.

The Director, Intelligence Bureau, (Home Department), Government of India, New Delhi. Subject ;- The Khaksar Movement in Bahrain Sir&lt; I have the honour to refer to your letter No. SS/P.^/ 31-XIII dated the 21st November 1939 on the subject cited above and to furnish the following information regarding the extent of the Khaksar Movement in Bahrain. 2. The movement was started in Bahrain about two years ago by Zahur Ahmad, an employee of the Bahrain I etroleum Company, whose Indian address is Katra ^oolo, Kuch ^ai, Amritsar, Punjab, and now has about 40 members. All the members are Indians. At present the oflice bearers ares Nazar Muhammad Qureshi, mentioned in your letter, who is the head of the Bahrain Branch; Zahur Ahmad, who is the Propaganda Secretary; and 4 Fateh Mohammad, a tailor and permanent resident of Bahrain who acts as Assistant to Nazar Muhammad ^ureshi. So far no propaganda has been carried out amongst , rabs as the headquarters of the Khaksar Movement has apparently forbidden this. At present the efforts of the movement are /- ■are mainly directed towards increasing their membership amongst Indians* 3* Prior to the outbreak of war their activities were generally confined to a weekly march in uniform and to weekly meetings in the house of Nazar Muhammad ^ureshi* The declaration of war appears to have frightened them and the weekly march was abandoned although it is stated that parades occasionally take place at night* During the recent Lucknow riots it is learnt that the Bahrain Branch sent through -^reshi about fe 600/- in response to a request from their headquarters* They were also asked at the time of these riots to send men to assist but replied that they were unable to do so* A certain number of copies of the Khaksor newspaper '*1 Islah' are received and circulated amongst members* Recently one 'anaullah Ziauddin ''alik, a Khaksar leader from Abdul Sattar Road, Ouetta, arrived in Bahrain and it is reported that his brother Abdul Aziz Malik, who is employed in the Public V'orks Department of the Bahrain Government, is shortly going on leave and will ask for fresh instructions re- ' garding propaganda amongst Arabs. 4. So far nothing objectionable has been observed about the movement in Bahrain which is the object of much derision by the Arab population. 5. It may be mentioned that a small branch of the Khaksar Movement exists at A1 Khobar in Saudi Arabia, the members of which are all Indian employees of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company.

LCA.5.2.Dear-What a folly to end tbls life simply for the worldly gain. Some sort of service to Islam Is essential. There is no other movement more useful to Islam that Phis one (Khaksar movement) Islam has some right on you and wants service from you. If necessity arose, only this movement will oppose the Congress and the Hindu raj. In my opinion every Muslim should Join this movement. The movement is in great swing in the U.P. 6000 Khaksars have been recrui ted in Bulandshahr alone. It is highly necessary that 25 lakhs of Khaksars should he recruited uptil January 1940. Officers have already been appeinted who have reached their posts. 120 officers have been posted in Bengal, N.W.F.Province, U.P., Burma, Sind, Punjab and Bihar. They will have to meet their own expenses and to remain thousands of miles away from their houses, there is therefore no reason why the movement should not flourish. In my opinion, you should try your best to spread the movement in Bahrain, put your heart and sould in the recruitment of Khaksars and keep me informed of your progress to enable me to publish it in the 'Al-Islah'. If required, the literature can be had from the Editor, 'Al-Islah', Lahore. This is God's work.

Yours sincerely,ANOTE ON THE KHAKSAR MOVEMENT. The founder.—The founder of the Khakaar movement is M. Inayatullah Khan Mashraqi, M.A., son of M. Ata Mohammed, a petition writer of Amritsar. Born about 1883 he had a brilliant scholastic career, taking the M.A. degree from the Punjab University and thence proceeding to England to compete in the I.C.S. examination. He failed in this owing to ill-health, but passed into the I.E.S. His service has been spent since 1907 almost entirely in the North-West Frontier Province, but he also for some time held the appointment of Assistant Secretary in the depart ment of Education, Health and Lands in the Government of India. He has generally been regarded as eccentric in his views and is an ardent pan-Islamist. He gave vent to his ideas in the latter connection in 1926, when at an Islamic Conference at Cairo, to which he was invited by the Shaikh- ul-Islam of Egypt, he made a sensational speech protesting against a proposal to elect the Sultan of Egypt as Khalifat- tui-Mussalmin on the ground that a vassal ruler could not be the spiritual leader of the Islamic world. On this occa sion he approached delegates to the conference for support for a scheme to establish a common Islamic fund to be known as Bait-ul-Mal with a capital of £20,000. The scheme fell through for want of support. While abroad he is reported to have come into contact with many Muslim leaders from various parts of the world and also with the notorious Obedullah (0-1, Punjab Political Who’s Who). He is well known as the author of a book entitled “ Tazkara”, which he describes as an attempt to apply the teachings of the Quran and the Hadis to the conditions of modern life, but which is regarded by orthodox Indian Muslims as the work of an agnostic. 2. Inception of the moveme^. ^-Inayatullah Khan was Head Master of the Government High School, Peshawar, in 3930. He appears to have been dissatisfied with his prospects and resented the fact that he had not received preferential treatment in the matter of promotion. He went on a years leave in October of that year and came to Lahore and has since retired on pension. In September, 1931, he founded the Khaksar movement in Ichhra, a suburb of Lahore. He took considerable pains in the course of interviews With the Government officials to persuade them that his move ment was in no way antogonistic to Government, but wasmerely an endeavour to -organise Muhammadans for the purpose of social service and in order to prove their unity and self-efficiency to attain swaraj in a shorter time than the methods employed by the Congress. These protesta tions, which he still continues, must be accepted with reserve, for he is reported, before launching his scheme, to have discussed ways and means with such notorious sedi- tionists as Abdul Gaffar Khan of Utmanzai and Dr. S t «if- ud-Din Kitchlew, both of whom promised him the fullest support. Government, moreover, have been warned on more than one occasion by well disposed Muhammadans that his ultimate object is far from innocuous and he has been unable at times to conceal his hostility towards the British Raj. The objects of the society were described in a book named “ Ishaarat ”, published by Inayatullah Khan in 1931. This book belied the idea that the author was in any way sympathetic to, or had any respect for, the British Government. The first nine chapters dealt with the necessity for Muslim regeneration all over the world. The next four displayed sympathy for the Congress Civil disobedience movement and hostility and hatred for the British Government, while the last part described his apparently innocuous movement. The advertised objects of this movement are as follows :— (1) To unite the community by practical life. (2) To promote equality. (3) To promote mutual love and affection by per suading people to serve one another. (4) To exalt the vision of the people by turning them into servants of God. (5) To establish uniformity by making people wear clothes of one colour. (6) To eschew communal disputation. (7) To abandon political sectarianism. (S) To strengthen the community by the practice of (9) ( 10 ) Islamic symbol ing them in drill. the belcha (a spade) To discipline all villages and cities under oJheer and the entire community under3 •4 / Amir and to make its members obey one command. (11) Not to collect subscriptio is.. (12) Not to withdraw any step taken by former National or Indian leaders, nor to oppose any person, community, association or movements (13) To become the ruling power by promoting unity. 3. Organisation. —The original directorate of tho Anjuman-i-Khaksiran was vested in an executive commit tee consisting of (1) Inayat-ullah Khan, Mashriqi, (2) Mufti Sahib, Mozang, Lahore, (3) Masud Ahmad Khan, B.Sc., of Lahore, (4) M.A. Majid, M.A., of Lahore, (5) Hakim Moham mad Din of Lahore. The organisation provides for a Dictator—“ Amir ”, and commanders of the various grades— “ Sar Salars ”, ‘‘ Salar Idara ”, “ Sippa Salars ”, etc., and Khaksars. 4. Extent of the Movement. — (a) In the Punjabi —Tnayat- ullah himself claims to have between five and six thousand volunteers and to have established branches in this province at a number of places in Lahore City and district, at Amrit sar, Sialkot, Gujran wala, Sargodh i, Ferozepora, Jullundur, Sheikhupura and Hoshiarpor. Apart from Lahore, Amrit sar and Saloh, a village in the Jullunlur district, however, no branches seem to be in active existence in this province. The conduct of the Khaksars in the Punjab has hitherto been unexceptionable : they do nothing but drill with their khaki clothes and bfdchas, perform occasional social services, and appear in formation at Muhammadan festivals. Some advertisement was obtained by the despatch of a party of nine Khaksars from Lahore on the 28th July, 1933, for a tour of the holy places of Mesoptamia and Arabia via Baluchistan, Persia and Nejed, and also later in the year by a tour by a party of North-West Frontier Province’s Khaksars to Amritsar and back. It is difficult to estimate the membership of the Anjuman with any accuracy, but there are probably not more than 6 or 700 members in this province. Inayatullah has incurred the hostility of the Ahrars and the movement has made no great progress. (&amp;) Outside [the Punjab. —Inayatullah claims to have organised ^branches at Bangalore, Madras, Sitapur and Peshawar. Of the first three places we have no informa tion, but the branch at Peshawar is definitely existent4 and active. The inception in the E’orth-'VVest Frontier Province of a movement whose organization followed Closely that of the Eed Shirts was regarded with apprehen sion by the authorities, and orders were passed in Novem ber, 1932, limiting recruitment to 250 and further restricting its outward activities in various ways. Inayatullah soon fell foul of the Peshawar authorities by ordering his Khaksars to salute Roshan Lai, a notorious revolutionary and a member of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, and since then the North-West Frontier Province C.I.D., have reported on various occasions the connection with the movement of men of objectionable political views. The Peshawar branch also came to notice by inaugurating a special form of spade fighting drill, a combination of “ gatka bazi” and bayonbt fighting. This was recently stopped under Inayatullah’s orders. 5. Funds .—No Khaksar is called upon to pay any subscription. He has merely to provide himself with khaki clothes. The belchas are issued by Inayatullah, who is said to have bought a large surplus stock at a cheap rate. There is no regular office and miscellaneous expenditure is borne by Inayatullah himself, who is said to possess a fortune of Bs. 80,000. No pay was formerly offered to the members, but a system of promissory notes has recently been intro duced. These notes are of R&gt;s. 10 and Rs. 5 denominations and the pay of Salars has been fixed at Rs. 50 per month for a Salar-i-Akbar, Rs. 20 for a Sar Salar and Rs. 15 for a Sippa Salar. The persian wording of these promissory notes has been carefully examined by the North-West Frontier Province C. I. D., who report significantly that it is capable of two interpretations. “ I promise to pay the bearer the ^ j on th 6 attainment of independence,, above-mentioned rupees rrr ” ^ with certainty 6. Summary .—There is sufficient to cause suspicion that this apparently innocuous movement is in reality intended by its founder to be used eventually for subversive ends. Enough has been said above to indicate Inayatullah’s trend of mind. It is significant that the rules of the Anjuman call for unquestioning obedience of every Khaksar to the orders of his leader, and that the pan-lslamic at mosphere pervades the whole scheme. If it attains the proportions hoped for by Inayatullah, it will eventually provide him with a very large and disciplined body ready at a moment’s notice to turn its activities in any direction ordered by the Amir. P, L. ORDR—10-11-33.Since the above note was written in November, 1933, it has been reported that Khaksar branches exist at the follow ing places in the Punjab :— Districts. (1) Lahore (2) Amritsar (3) Gujrat Jalalpur Jattan in the Gujrat district (4) Gujranwala Wazirabad in the Gujranwala district (5) Chakwal, district Jhelum ♦ (6) Sialkot (7) Ferozepore (8) Dera Ghazi Khan (9) Jullundur Outside the Punjab the movement has secured a footing in the North-West Frontier Province and Sind, while it is believed that branches have recently been opened at Delhi, Hyderabad, Tatta and Sukkar. There has also been some talk of branches being established further afield at Allaha bad and Bengal, but it is doubtful whether any progress has been made with these proposals. In the Punjab the movement has made little progress, except in Lahore and Amritsar. At the former place the presence of Inayat Ullah himself probably accounts for some of the success which has been achieved. In March, 1934, at an executive Com mittee meeting of the Khaksar movement, Inayat Ullah stated that he had obtained a plot of land near Ichhra, on which a Khaksar “ training school ” would be built to impart military aid training to Khaksar volunteers. Nothing further has been heard of this proposal. The Shahidganj Agitation in July, 1935, gave Inayat TJllah an opportunity which he was not slow to seize and his support of the agitation gave some impetus to the movement. The greatest measure of success, however, ha&amp; Membership. Approximately 200 175 55 »» H &gt;r »&gt; 80 60 20 Not known. Approximately 25 „ 20 „ 25 Not known.been achieved at Amritsar in spite of opposition from the AKrars. In January, 1934, the Amritsar volunteers num bered not more than 30 and it was believed that differences of opinion among Khaksar communities of the various MohaUas in Amritsar were responsible for a lack of any real enthusiasm. The Ahrars of the Punjab have always opposed Inayat Ullah and his party and when the Ahrars failed to give any material support to the Shahidganj agitation the Khaksar movement in Amritsar became increasinglv popular. Maulvi Ismail Ghaznavi devoted a considerable amount of his time to the movement and by the end of September, 1935, the Khaksars of Amritsar were organizing weekly parades in the city at which volunteers marched in quasi- military formation and were armed with belchas. During the month of October Khaksar parades at Amritsar became more frequent and at the beginning of November it was estimated that the number of Khaksar volunteers in Amritsar num bered approximately 175. Since a branch of the Khaksar Anjuman was opened in Gujrat in 193*, Allama Inavat Ullah has paid frequent visits to that district, with the result that a certain amount of progress has been made. Similar pro gress is being made in Gujranwala, where during October, 1934, a branch of the Khaksar organisation known as the ^ Sword Party ” was organised. This party paraded the City bazaars with naked swords borrowed from the local Theatrical Club, but these parades ceased when the local authorities issued a warning that the processionists were rendering themselves liable to action under Section 107, Cr. P. C. During October, 1935, Inayat Ullah visited Chak- t\al in the Jhelum district and enlisted an important recruit in the person of Kaja Muhammad Sarfraz Khan, M.L.C. This indn idual, w ho has considerable influence in the Jhelum district, was appointed a (&lt; Salar-i-Akbar — U j. trie Khaksars of Lahore arranged a “ mock war ” in the Munici pal Gardens outside Delhi Gate. Crackers were used to represent bombs and “ wounded ” men were removed to a a hospital . Inayat Ullah Mashriqi arrived after the war had concluded, was given a salute by a guard-of- honour consisting of 170 Ma/csars armed with swords and spades and later inspected the guard accompanied by Baja Muhammad Sarfraz Khan, M.L.C., mentioned above, inayat UUih addressed tne parade and although tbe major portion o his speech was inaudible he was heard to say that the Knaksars should unite and oppose force with force.7 Amritsar.—On the 9fch and 10th of NovembBr similar operations took place at Amritsar. One hundred and fifty Khaksar volunteers paraded with a band in the Anjuman Park and later erected a camp where they spent the night. The next morning the volunteers were inspected by Abdur Kahman, the u Salar-i-Akbar ” and it was noticed that 20 “ Unit Commanders ” were armed with daggers and swords, dhe “ mock war ” which followed was carried out in the presence of about 10,000 people on a plot of land enclosed by kanats ; in the centre was a circle of huts representing a fort. The A/m&amp;srtr volunteers were divided into two parties, one of which garrisone 1 the fort ”, while the other was detailed off to besiege the same. The attack started at 2-0 p.m., crackers being used to represent bombs and the siege lasted until 5-0 p.m. when the prisoners, including the “ com mander ” of the fort were produced before the “ 8alar-i- Aklar' , \ Abdur Eahman. After the besieged party had made a complete submission the parade observed a minute’s silence for those who had been li killed and wounded ” in the battle. After saluting the “ Sa!ar-i-Akbar ” the parade of Khaksars was dismissed. Gujranwala- —In November, 1935, the Khaksars of Guj- ranwala held a “mock war” outside the City which was witnessed by about 400 spectators. Gujrat .—Late in the same month another similar de monstration was staged outside Gujrat City. Recently Inayat Ullah announced that Ibn-i-Saud, Kin°* of the Hedjaz, would invite 1,000-ff/iu/esars to the Muslim holy places on fhe occasion of the Haj pilgrimage and it was also reported that these men would be selected when the Khaksar camp met at Delhi in the latter part of December. Accord ing to Press reports the Government of India have, after making enquiries, contradicted this report, with the result that a large number of Khaksar enthusiasts have accused Inayat Ullah of being a liar and he has been subjected to severe criticism by his Salars. Inayat Ullah also announced that the Nizam of Hyderabad would visit Delhi during the latter part of December, would visit the Khaksar camp 0 and take a salute from the Khaksar volunteers. This move to attract recruits will probably fail as the announcement has already been contradicted. During the latter part of Novem ber a poster appeared in Lahore over the signature of Pir Jaraait Ali Shah, leader of the Shahidganj agitation, in which the Pir gave his blessing to the Khaksar movement and ordered all Muhammadans to take part in the coming Khaksar\ 8 celebrations at Delhi. However, in a statement published later in the Press Jamait Ali Shah has cancelled his previous announcement alleging that it was obtained from him under a misapprehension. Keports now received show that the re pudiation of Inayat Ullah’s pilgrimage scheme, the denial that his Exhalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad would attend the Delhi party and the above-mentioned announce ment of Pir Jamait Ali Shah have all given severe blows to Inayat Ullah’s prestige and it is unlikely that the Khaksar movement will make further progress in the Punjab, at any rate for the present. T * J. C. LOBB—19-12-35. Since the last note on the Khaksar movement was re corded in December, 1935, the following branches of the organisation are reported to have been established in various parts of India :— (a) Punjab— (1) Lahore. (2) Amritsar. (3) Gujrat. (4) Gujranwala. (5) Jhelum. (6) Sialkot. (7) Ferozepore. (8) Dera Ghazi Khan. (9) Jullundur. States. (1) Bahawalpur. (2) Malerkotla. (b) Delhi. —(Proper). (c) North-West Frontier Province (1) Kohat. (2) Dera Ismail Khan. (3) Bannu. (4) Hoti Mardan. (5) TehkhelBalsu (10) Rawalpindi. (11) Ludhiana. (12) Shahpur. (13) Hoshiarpar. (14) Oampbcllpur.

Assistant Oom- (7) Salar-Mdara .. &lt;{ manders are only appoin ted during camps and L manmuvres. (8) Pakbazea .. Senior Janbazes. (9) Janbazes (10) Khaksars .. Signatories of the “blood pledge .. Privates. The Janbazes occnpy a position of special importance in the hierarchy. They are required to sign, in their own blo^d, a pledge which is not rigid, but follows a set pattern so closely that deviations from it may be regarded as unimportant. The oath is taken by the Janbazes on the Quran in the pre sence of a responsible leader. The pledge runs : — tl Bespeeted Allama Inayat Pllah Mashriqi. Greetings. I re gard myself in the presence of God as one of the worst sinners. I hereby declare that from to-day I place my life, wealth, and everything else bestowed on me by the Al mighty at the disposal of your great Institution in the service of God and Islatn. If I disobey the orders of God and Islam, may I be consigned to hell on the day of re surrection. May God abcept my pledge in blood. I sub mit the pledge to the Khaksar Central Institution which has undertaken the duty of guiding the Muslims according to the injunctions of God and the Prophet I pray that the Almighty may give me strength to observe this pledge faithfully ”. It is claimed that there are at present in India, about 7,397 Khaksars, including 649 Janbazes. Implicit obedience to the commands of the Amir is demanded of the Khaksars generally and the Janbazas in particular. The hold of Inayat Ullah on persons who sign the “blood pledge” is very considerable, and it is this aspact of the movement which must be viewed with^grave suspicion. 3. Funds .—The funds of the organisation are reported to amount approximately to Rs. 18,000, which are deposited in the personal account of Inayat Ullah in the Imperial Bank of India. 4. Mock Fars.—During 1936, 1937 and 1938, altogether 23, 40 and 57 “ Military Camps ” were held by the Khaksars in the Punjab. “ Mock wars ”, in fact, formed the most important activity of the Khaksars in recent years. CampsXL were organised at important centres ; bodies of Khaksars drywn from local and outside sources, paraded in military formations for a specific number of days: and the camm terminated with sham fights in the course of which, sticks spades, and crackers were freely used by “ the opposing armies . An innovation in “ armament ” was made at thf f ? eld in tlle Rawal,: ' indi distri ct from the 15th to 17th April, 1938, when a new form of spade was brought nt fi VT; ii 116 S P ade . ls P rov i ded with a detonator whfcn is fixed to the right side of the spade and consists of an iron bolt worked by a spring. The bolt strikes against the iron block, upon which the detonating mixture is placed and produces a loud report. To the casual observeV however a body of Khaksars on parade, with their Khaki uniforms U Q l?d soldiers. th&lt;! aP|,edrance of a fati g ue P^ty of badly Tn August 1936, it was reported that the Sikhs of Gujranwala, bad taken serious objection to the route marches organised by the Khaksar volunteers in front of places of workship.

The attendance on this occa sion was confined to Salars and Janbazes only. On thk occasion the parades and sham fights were attended by uniformed women volunteers, among whom the daughter of Inayat Uliah was prominent. The camp had an S st ing sequel which is indicative of the strong hold that the movement has on its follo«ers. In Mav 1937 Mnhd ai a Khaksar of Gujranwala, was nogged^nder'ie'oVemTf the ( rtdh w.

On the 21st August, 1938 during a ‘ mock war” at Lahore Tavab Ali Shah, a young Khaksar, received fatal injuries from a fuse which he was carrying under his armpit along with a bag-full of crackers. The fuse caught fire, setting the crackers ablaze, and caused severe burns to J ayab Ah Shah, who succumbed to his injuries in hospital two days laier. t is significant that no complaint in the matter was made &gt;y the survivors of Tayab Ali Shah, and it was, in fact, at their specific request that the post-mortem examination of the dead man’s body was dispensed with by the police. 5 Other activities.-'Dmug these years, Inayat Ullati maintained his hold on popular imagination by advertism, grandiloquent schemes for the betterment of the Mnsbm community in and outside India. In 1937, six Khaks rs 'the Hyderabad State were despatched to Heij iz with letters from Inayat Ullah to King lbn-I-Sand and he Minister of Finance of the Hedjaz Government. King Ibn- I-Saud declined to accept the delivery of the letters, but the Khaksar deputation was able to interview the ' rf Finance. The deputation demanded free transport &gt; or themselves and special facilities for future Khaksar pilgrims but was unsuccessful in obtaining any concessions trom the Hediaz Government. The members of the deputation distributed a great deal of propagandist literature in and around Mecca, but were apparently unable to found braucaos in Arabia. On the 17th January, 1938, a statement was made by Bashir Ahmad Siddiqi, a j rominent Khaksar leader o Peshawar, t i the effect that Inayat Ullah intonded to con struct a fort in Lahore, for the purpose of establishing a training sentre for the Khaksars from all over . This fort was to be built by Khaksar labour, hieedles to say, nothing was done in furtherance of this scheme. In September, 1938, Inayat Ullah, accompanied by Muhammad Sadiq, a Khaksar leader of Lyallpur, proceeded to Bombay en route to Cairo to attend the All-World Muslim Conference on Palestine which took place in the13 month of October, 1938. They, however, failed to secure the grant of vitas from the Consul General for Egypt and consequently returned to the Punjab. On the 6th December, 1938, in a poster issued by Inayat Ullah, it was stated that 10,000 Kbaksars would proceed to Palestine towards the end of the month to prevent “ the destruction of Muslims by the British Government in that country ”. As was to be expected, the announcement remained an empty boast. The relations of Inajat Ullah with the Government of the North*West Frontier Province may be briefly men tioned. Inayat Ullah was externed from the Peshawar district in 1934. From that time onwards, Inayat Ullah held out various threats of civil disobedience against the Government of the North-West Frontier Province if the restrictions imposed upon him and his movement in that province were not removed by the 15th August, 1937. Eventually after some negotiations between the Government and the Khaksar leaders, the ban on Inayat Ullah’s entry into the Peshawar district and the restrictions on the Khaksar movement in the North-West Frontier Province were removed on the 20th August, 1937. 6. Present demands .—It may be observed that Inayat Ullah claims that the Khaksar movement is entirely non political and is designed solely for the advancement of Muslim interests. He has now formulated three “ non- political ” demands, the acceptance of which by the Govern ment has been repeatedly and strongly urged by the Khaksar leaders in their public utterances and in the (i Al- Islah ”, the Khaksar organ. These demands are (1) The establishment of a Broadcasting Station at Ichhra, the headquarters of the movement near Lahore, for the purpose of disseminating the true teaching of the Quran and for the delivery of a common IcJiutba on the occasion of Id prayers* (2) The organisation of a Government agency for the collection of zalat with a view to the establish ment of a Khaksar Bait-ul-Mal. (3) The grant of permission to Government servants to join the Khaksar movement. These demands were given wide publicity by the Khak- sars in a poster which appeared in Rawalpindi on the J.5tb14 August, 1938, and it was stated that if the demands were not conceded, there would be bloodshed. Similar threats have been made by the various Khaksar leaders from time to time. The attitude of the Punjab Government towards these demands is as follows :— (i) Broadcasting Station .— Broadcasting is a Central subject. The application of the Khaksar leaders for the establishment of a broadcasting station was forwarded by the Punjab Government to the Government of India in November, 1938, with the suggestion that if the request for opening a broadcasting station was unacceptable, the Khaksars might be permitted to broadcast on purely social subjects from the All-India Radio • Stations subject to the usual conditions and restrictions applicable to private persons. (ii) 'Bait-u 1 -''lal. —The Government could only legislate for the collection of zakat if the Muslim com munity 80 desired. It was for the Muslims as a whole to indicate through their representatives if they desired that zakat should be collected and the organisation to vhich the custody of the zakat funds should be entrusted. Any proposal relat ing to zakat would have to be referred to a con ference of the representatives of all sections of the community before it was introduced in the legislature. It was open to the Khaksars to canvass the support of the various sects. (in) Grant of permission to Government Servants to join the movement. —The Government Servants Con duct Rules prohibit Government servants from participating in any political, as distinct from purely social and educational, movement. There has so far been no indication of any desire on the part of the general Muslim community to support all or any of the Khaksar demands. G.
