Prime Minister has no illusions about the assurances he has received from Germany Minister about ships, fifth column, etc, but he is hampered by the Shah's policy of industrial development which has filled Iran with Germans and he places too much faith in police supervision. He agreed with apparent sincerity to the two propositions which I laid down ( 1 ) that Iran has no reason to think that Germany would be a better neighbour than she considers Russia to have been and (o) that the independence and integrity of Iran are of commanding interest to His Majesty's Government but not to Germany. 4.

(b) There was no likelihood of any change in the Shah f s policy while the war lasted and no likelihood of a pro-German Gove mine nt. (c) Iranians were extremely alarmed at the situation in Iraq. He considered it certain that if the Germans became established in Iraq there would be a partition agreement between^Russia*and Germany covering the Near East. (d) It was vital in his opinion that we should settle Iraqi affair with the utmost speed and that we should go into Syria. (e) He further states that he had advised his Government to create 'prohibited areas' in Iran on the model of recent *[?

I think it probable, however, that he may really believe that German control of Iraq might be a safeguard against the U.S.S.R, ” Such an idea is clearly false, at any rate in the way Prime. Minister conceives it, for the Gemans, once established in Iraq, would only be interested in taking our place, but probably by complete occupation, in Southern Iran and would not bother about Northern Iran.

U 0 W * E ZOZi/^2/3^ I spoke to the Prime Minister in the sense of the third paragraph. He isa quiet, able and reasonable man. I found him no longer complacent but fully conscious of the^dangers that threaten Iran (Persia). He spoke with a clarity and decision which he could not have used had he not been voicing' [settled] views of the Shah. These views which were conveyed partly by means of shrewd questions about Iraq, Turkey, Soviet Union and America amounted to this. Sir R. Bullard, No. 216. 12th May 1 94l, Repeated to Cairo Moscow 2. Iran has to reckon with incalculable policy of Soviet Union and with; the possibility 'that Germany may shortly be her neighbour in Iraq, at least in the northern part. Turkey will not necessarily fight and if she does she cannot long delay German advances. Great Britain has been criminally negligent about Iraq and her slowness in restoring her influence there exposes Iran to great danger. Iranian Government discounted German assurances as to the innocence of Germans in Iran, but the number hasbeen kept as low as industrial requirements admitted and if Iranian Government suddenly asked many of them to leave, it would be attributed to political motives, and would cause trouble for Iranian Government and for the British too (evidently Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). Besides, those turned out could return from Iraq if the Germans established themselves there and wished to make trouble in Iran. If the British hold Iraq, Germans here will probably remain quiet; if not, Germans may make trouble m Iran, but they may not, or they may.even be useful against Sovier {Union, Best course is therefore to keep the Germans under supervision and not to create crisis now, to avoid the possibility of crisis later. 5. Although we argued for an hour [ ? I was ] unable to shake the Prime Minister. I gained the impression that he would have liked to suspend industrial development during the war perhaos on economic as well as political grounds, but thata o *» # the Shah had made up his mind to continue. The Prime Minister expressed thanks to His Maiesty T s Government for their advice and promised zo investigate my assertion that there are two Germans in the wireless station. I am sure that Iranian Government will not risk German displeasure by any such measure as requiring large numbers or Gennans to leave, or seizing Axis ships to forestall sabotage. Prime Minister agrees that the independence of Iran is essential to us, out too many countries . in a like position have suffered at German hands for Iran to depart from present policy.

ISiis journal is pfahlished in the Persian language and circulated to hueinesc houses in Iran and others. It is sent freely through the post its circulation unimpeded becauet it purports to be a commercial (and not a political) Journal * 4 5. The main tendencies of the Journal are the following:- (a) It shows that due importance is given to Iren in Oemany. &amp;uoh a tendency is well calculated to flatter the vanity of the Iranian, who is highly susceptible to neglect and to being treated as an oriental. (b) It aims at showing the alleged strength of the German economic position. (c) It attempts to show the alleged wealeness of the British economic position. (d) Publicity is given to German social conditions of workers in modern Germany, etc. 4 . Thus under the cover of Irano-German trade relations considerable publicity is given to the Geman point of view. The mblication Is perhaps somewhat crude, but it is probabl well-suited to the class to which it is primarily Intended to appeal, namely the merchant eomnsmity.

Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(RecHvedMZdtm (No. 280.) Sir, Tehran, December 27, 1940. THE success of German propaganda in Iran and the failure of our own propaganda to make any appreciable headway against it has been indicated frequently by the press attach^ in her reports to me. After reviewing the present situation in consultation with the press attache, the commercial secretary and other members of my staff, I have the honour to submit the following observations and proposals :— 2. In Iran, as elsewhere, German propaganda has been built up primarily on the basis of successful commercial penetration. In the first place, German successes in the commercial field have in themselves proved an excellent advertise ment. The fact that the Germans have been able to deliver at least a substantial part of the goods expected from them has given the impression that Germany is overcoming her war difficulties comparatively well, and that the dislocation of her economy has been less than that of our own. A secondary result of German commercial activity is the presence of numerous commercial agents and technicians, who are dispersed all over the country and come into contact with all classes of the Iranian population. These persons, under the direction of the German Legation and local party leaders, form an ideal channel for the dissemina tion of propaganda. They have devoted particular attention to the official, military and merchant classes, with conspicuous success in predisposing them against Britain and persuading them of the chances of German victory. 3. With the ground thus prepared, the Germans have been able to exploit to the full their advantages in the field of propaganda, such as the greater facility in obtaining up-to-date material—literature, news-reels, &amp;c. By contrast our own propaganda, as a result of what Iranians regard as our failure in the com mercial field, has been a plant without roots. Our inability to deliver the material which the Iranian Government hoped to obtain under the credits agreement and our failure, after prolonged negotiation, to conclude an agreement for the supply of rails from India—these are examples of things which have weakened confidence in us and caused the Iranian Government to look to others. The difficulties which were responsible for these disappointments have, when possible, been explained by the commercial secretary or myself, and occasionally these explanations may have met with some sympathy from our immediate hearers. But Iranians are better at making excuses than at listening to them, and the fact therefore remains that Iranians of the commercial and official classes have gained the idea that our commercial dealings in Iran are governed by a harassed vacillation, which is inevitably interpreted as weakness. Moreover, the Iranian Government’s success in obtaining, with the help of threats, large concessions from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and His Majesty’s Government in the matter of royalties and exchange has given currency to the belief in some quarters that similar results can continue to be produced by similar means. 4. It is not unnatural that in such circumstances the task of conducting useful propaganda has become almost entirely unproductive. Iranians are unlikely to accept any evidence of British strength, which propaganda may offer so long as they have before their eyes what they regard as tangible proof of British weakness. Other difficulties faced by our propaganda, such as the inability of most Iranians to comprehend the nature of our aims or the value of our sea power, are small in relation to this radical disability. Hitherto preoccupa tions elsewhere have allowed us little chance to improve this situation. The arrival of representatives of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation should help considerably to improve our commercial relations with Iran. While it is not supposed that anything spectacular can be achieved in a short time, purchases of Iranian produce by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation will inevitably [14—44]2 ! influence certain members in official and commercial circles. On the 26th December the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation participated in an adjudication for 40 tons of silk cocoons, and there is every indication that they will secure these cocoons, which the Germans were very anxious to secure. In addition, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation are negotiating for the purchase of 600 tons of castor oil seeds, 5,000 tons of cotton seeds, 100,000 cases of raisins, and they also appear anxious to purchase a part of the spring wool clip. 5. In these circumstances, I would urge that all possible support be given to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation representatives in their activities in Iran. The question of the supply of goods to Iran is equally important. Iranian officials have from time to time referred to British broadcasts announcing that exports from the United Kingdom continue on a large scale, and enquire why it is that Iran cannot obtain cement, locomotives, rolling stock, dyes, chemicals, &amp;c. We should, therefore, make every effort to supplement pre-emptive purchases by the supply of goods, whether from the United Kingdom or elsewhere. 6. It is hoped that the work of the United Kingdom Commercial Corpora tion will not he restricted merely because the balance in the proposed transactions may tend to be on the wrong side, financially. It is hoped that this will not happen, but if it should, it should be remembered that the Germans are not governed by financial prudence in their purchases of essential commodities in this country, and also—to return to the note on which this despatch was begun—that active trade between this country and the United Kingdom and other parts of the empire will create that background of self-interest without which our propaganda is very largely thrown away. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office; the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department; and to the Middle East Intelligence Centre, Cairo.

An Iraqi named Ibrahim Khumaiyis Jauhar aged 24 recantly employed as secondary schoolmaster Bagdad appears to be German agent according to Iraqi Charge d v Affaires who reports: Jauhar was at German university before becoming schoolmaster Bagdad, He came to Iran last summer on grounds oi health and recently he applied to Iraqi Legation Tehran for passport, to be endorsed for Germany for health reasons. Suspecting applicant’s motives Charge d 4 Affaires kept passport on technical pretext and issued laissez passer good for journey to Iraq. It is believed'“tlidt he or the Germans altered this document to make it appear valid for journey to Berlin via Russia and that Germans secured Russian transit visa but Charge d'Affaires warned police secretly and Jauhar was turned back at Pehlevi though he did not produce lai ssez passer which he said he had lost. Germans then asked Bulgarian Legation to grant Jahuar transit visa but Charge d’Affaires refused in absence of request from Iraqi Legation. Jauhar decided to return to Iraq and left by train for Ahwaz.. Iraqi Charge d : Affaires asked me whether I could ascertain confidentially from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz whether Jauhar had left Iran or not. He said that he did not like to enquire from Iraqi Consul at Ahwaz because he didnot trust the man. This Consul, who is a Sa dun, is believed by the Charg' d'Affaires to have become pro-German because he was transferred to Ahwaz from a comfortable^ billet in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Bagdad, His Majesty s Consul at Ahwaz eventually reported departure of Jauhar for Khorramshahr January 12tn with an Iranian exit visa so that Iraqi Charg' d'Affaires who in the meantime had enquired through his own Consul after all trusts that Jahuar has in fact returned to Bagdad and not doubled back i:.i Iran and tried to reach Germany by some route or other.

I again spoke to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs about the large number of Germans in Iran and recent arrival of some who are believed to be officers sent to plan subversive activities against our interests, and I spoke to the Prime Minister in the same sense. On the strength of a report just received from a colleague, I was able to tell Prime Minister of my belief that in transport firm of Schenker in Jehran, there are several newly arrived Germane who are officers fresh from Polish and French campaigns and have nothing to &lt;;o with the wor&gt;: of the firm. 2, Both took sa p line. All Germans are closely watched and their movements reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately. Some who appeared to have no wor^ or were otherwise suspicious have been turned out and applications for visas have been closely scrutinised and many rejected. His Majesty's Government might rest assured that Iranian Government had taken every precaution and that nothing was to be feare from Germans. 3. I recalled what happened in Holland and asked whether the Germans at or engaged for work at Kerej were all needed for erection of blast furnaces, whether Iranian Government knew how many officers there were amongst recent arrivals, and whether Iranian Government attached any value to an assurance by German Minister that such and such a person was essential for the work of a given German firm. in reply, the assurances given above were repeated and the necessity to engage Germane to erect huge .nantitles of machinery ordered from Germany was streased. That is the main difficulty: the Shah's scheme of industrial development, much of which affects his personal pocket, is at stake. r.-caution a mentioned are, in fact, taken, but they are of doubtful efficacy, because Germany continuously (gp. omtd.; Germans, and Iran police are incompetent, ill-paid and corrupt. 4. I pointed out to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, (not for the first time) and to the Prime Minister, I the particular danger of German propaganda which tries to stir 1/ up discontent against the regime and against us, whom it ( accuses of abetting its foundation and continuing to support 1 it.

CONFIDENTIAL My dear Geoffrey, I have read with great interest the letter which you sent to Halifax on the 11th December r regarding oil in the Middle East. In particular, we have considered whether there is anything more that we can do to combat the subversive activities of enemy agents in Iran and elsewhere. On this point, we have decided to send a telegram, of which I enclose a copy herein, to our Minister at Tehran, authorising him to take up with the Iranian authorities the desirability of their taking immediate action to force the eight recently arrived German officers (in civilian disguise) to leave the country. The Iranians probably did not like letting these people in, and it is of course doubtful whether they will pluck up courage to turn them out. The~-memorandum on 'The Future of Oil in its 'relation to the Middle East' certainly deserves serious consideration by all of us who are concerned with the formation of our future policy in that part of the world. I note that it would be rash to rely on the continuity of large American oil supplies to Europe and elsewhere for any considerable.number of years to come, and that this renders Middle Eastern oil even more important to us than it would otherwise be I am sending copies of this letter to Amery and Lloyd.

I am not clear what action has been taken as regards arrival in Iran of these eight German officers, but, if you have not already done so, it might be well to approach the Iranian Government on the subject. Iranian Government can be asked whether they are aware of the real reasons why these German officers have recently established themselves in Iran. It could be suggested to Iranian Government that it is not to be supposed, at this stage of the war, that these German officers are occupying themselves entirely with civil work. It is reasonably certain that the object of their visit to Iran is to advance the German Governments political or military aims. Their activities are presumably directed against British interests in the Middle East, and Iranian Government must take into account the probability that any action against British interests might also be action against Iranian interests. Iranian Government could be informed of report which has reached us (see Moscow telegram No.963 (of November 4)) that there are certain 'German officers dressed as civilians' who have been given the task of conducting in Iran all kinds of subversive activities, particularly against the oilfields. The Iranian Government will probably share the view that these German activities may well be directed against the Anglo-Iranian oilfields. In any case, they will doubtless consider it advisable, in order to prevent Iranian territory from being used for unneutral activities of any kind, to take irmnediate action to force these German agents to leave the country. 2. Any such communication should probably be verbal, at any rate until we can obtain more definite evidence, but it might be well to add a specific request that, as the safety oi tiie oilfields may be affecYed, which are of such vital importance/importance to Iran's prosperity, the matter uay be broughtDecypher.

I endeavour to tceep fear of fifth column activities alive at teiniatry of Foreign Affairs and have spoken to Acting Minister, of report from fcoscow of despatch of German officers as well as of considerable numbers of Germans employed at KereJ, thirty miles from Tehran on construction of blast furnaces. Acting Minister is openly friendly to the Allies but he is complacent about the measures taken to watch the Germans and cannot believe that they could do harm. That is general official attitude. I have tried to obtain evidence which I could put to dim tiiat Iran is being used as base for plot against British interests in other countries but I cannot give names without danger of ing sources (my telegram _No.411 paragraph 3 ). are not here as German officers but as employees of transport and other companies.

Having occasion to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs today, I said that Germans here were keeping very quiet, and when he agreed, I suggested that they no longer needed to indulge in anti-British activities, in view of the anti- British attitude of the Iranian Government, as shown in articles in the press. I gave instances of such articles, in particular, those about Anglo-Persian Oil Company and about Egypt? and said that attacks were all the more surprising in view of the protests which the Iranian Government made, if a remark which they considered derogatory to Iranians, appeared in the most insignificant English newspaper. Minister for Foreign Affairs said lamely, that the press enjoyed H a certain freedom', but did not maintain this seriously when I refused to accept it. 2. I asked whether, if Egypt were ever incorporated in Mussolini's Roman Empire Iranians would march to liberate her. Minister for Foreign Affairs was confused and silent, being naturally unable to quote on an article obviously dictated by the Shah. 3. Under Secretary of State, who is honest and friendly, urged me not to pay much attention to the press criticisms which he implied were useful in keeping the Germans quiet. This may explain earlier attacks but not the articles about Egypt.

If reliable reporting system could be arranged (see paragraph 5 of my 3/oif. tele 0 ram No. 103 [of the 30th May]), it might be possible to entrust to Royal Air Force task of stopping any German vessel that left Bandar Shahpur, and Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, Basra, is being authorised to take action provided he receives definite orders from Naval Officer in Charge, Basra. He is being instructed that aircraft may if necessary enter Iranian territorial waters, though they must not of course in any event cross Iranian coast. 2. For obvious reasons it would hov/ever be greatly preferable to render ships themselves immobile. I take it that you have little hope now of inducing Iranian Government to remove crews. Alternative would be to get them to remove some essential part of machinery without delay. Senior Naval Officer in Persian Gulf, to whom this telegram is being repeated, may be able from information at his disposal to suggest what machinery could best be removed. If he does so, please urge this solution strongly on the Iranian Government. You might again emphasise that the blocking of the Shatt-el-Arab would be serious financial blow to the Iranian Government and therefore it is greatly in their interests to take effective measures to render such an act impossible. Moreover, removal of machinery would be analogous to removal of breech-blocks from armed tankers entering Abadan, and could not be regarded as at variance with policy of strict neutrality.

Cypher telegram to Sir R. Bullard (Tehran). Foreign Office. 30th May, 1940. 7.00 p.m. No. 103. IM-iEDIATE. Your telegram No. 149 [of 26th May: possible sabotage by crews of German ships at Bandar Shahpurj. I approve the steps you are taking to secure removal of German crews. His Majesty's Government regard this step as most important in British and Iranian interests alike. 2, As regards the possible sinking of a ship, you will have seen from Senior Naval Officer's telegram No. 2345/26 of 27th May that a naval patrol has been instituted outside Iranian territorial waters. When you speak of 'action in Iranian territorial waters', I presume you have in mind possibility that one of His Majesty's Ships might as matter of practical necessity intercept an escaping German vessel while still in Iranian territorial waters between the mouth of Khor Musa and the mouth of the Rooka Channel. On any interpretation of the division of territorial waters in this area the vessel could at any rate get very near to the mouth of the Rooka Channel before it left Iranian territorial waters, for which Iranian Government claim a six-mile belt. 3. His Majesty's Government are instructing the Senior Naval Officer that if German ships start to move, they must be prevented from reaching Rooka Channel at all costs. The sloops will do their best to intercept any escaping vessel outside Iranian territorial waters, but should if necessary do so inside (i.e. even inside three mile limit). 4. I trust that any vessel would be intercepted before it reached Rooka Channel and that the question of action in Channel itself would not arise. But if this possibility is mentioned to you. you should bear in mind that His Majesty's Government do not recognise any Iranian claim. If it is not mentioned, I feel, subject to your views, that it would be best to give no explanations or warnings to the Iranian Government in advance, but to take for granted complete liberty for Iraqi Government and their Allies to act in what ever manner they think right in all parts of the Channel. 5, Gould His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz in conjunction with Anglo-Inanian Oil Company arrange a system whereby speedy intelligence of any move by the vessels or their crews would be conveyed tbH^imJand Company?

Internal situation is had economically and therefore politically. Trade with Germany largely has ceased and in spite of recent agreement trade with Russia not resumed. Situation si particularly had in Tabriz where bread is lacking and some unrest is reported. 2. Poorer people are [2 grps, undec.] reported to he more favourable than formerly to Communism which is also making appeal to intellectuals. Communist propaganda being spread by Armenians who are inevitably anti Turkish, and probably by some of the many thousands of Soviet and Iranian subjects who have entered Iran from Soviet Russia during last few years. 3. Whether Germans here are working with Russians or not their secret propaganda tends in the same direction, since it attacks the greed and oppression of Shah who is represented as supported by His Majesty^ Government. If the Shah were overthown any Government that succeeded him would tend to be anti British* A. It is true the army is believed to be faithful to the Shah as a whole and that revolution not supported by army would seem to be unlikely to succeed. But the police are believed to be in the hands of Russians and Germans and the army could perhaps be hampered ■ seriously by methods which the Germans have used recently in Holland. 5. We attributed trade agreement between Iran and Russia partly to pressure from Germany who it was supposed feared that extension of the conflict to Iran would delay the despatch of goods to Germany from this country. This does not apply now when Germany is getting little from here and when she appears to be staking all on a quick decision. 6. Indifference of Iran Government to presence of so many Germans in Tehran is disquieting. It is trie that the Minister of Interior is making enquiries, but without the speed which the occasion demands, while the Prime Minister, who is corrupt even by Iran standards is believed to be in with the Germans. Minister for Foreign Affairs seems to pay little a++^ntion to representations about Germans from myself and my Frenai.. and lu colleagues. Possibly/Possibly the interpretation of this axtitude is that Germans are regarded as a brake on Russia -* a consideration which may have ^ weight with the Shah though he may he ignorant of facts through concealment by the police. I will ask Turkish Ambassador, who has a privileged position, whether he cannot secure an interview with the Shall. . 7. I do not wish to be alarmist especially as I cannot 1 point to specific danger or suggest really useful counter I measures. Apart from the smallness of the property-ow.:’’;;g v class already much diminished by the avarice of the Shah and possibly the army, the only element desiring that stability which I assume suits us best at this moment is the Shah. That is why I have always pressed for the most favourable economic treatment for Iran as tending to please him and also to enable him to keep things goingo 8. I cannot say what the attitude of Russia would be towards coup d'etat assisted by Germans. Probably they would welcome the collapse of the Shah’s [7 rule]; since the scare about danger to Baku they cannot be expected to be anything but anti British in this part of the world, I fear that at the first evidence that we were preparing to defend Abadan and the oil fields Soviet Russia would occupy the north of Iran in virtue of article 6 of Treaty of 1921 0 Repeated to m.I.C.E., Cairo, Government of India No. 8/ and Bagdad.Si th ' , N oE^ DUn t: ^ Copy* (K 1965/48/34) / — /h^oitJ r^/jLAeJo-yy /?

The friendly, indeed often enthusiastic, echo which in the lanes of the East greeted the accession to power of the Third RCldh, erabolded the persons just referred to to put their suggestions to the dovernoient . The,, resuscitated the dream of the Bagdad railway in the imagination of the Nazi rulers and did not fail to flatter the seif-cdfceem of the Nazis by drawing their attention to the sympathy felt in the lands of the East for the 'work of political renewal 1 * an.. ' * t he aw a -ten i n* of if rr . The principal advisers of the Government were, amongst others, the i inister (Diplomatic) Jr. Rx*ufer, the minister jr. von dentig, Geheimrat Professor Jr. j aurice, the publisher &gt;r. udi Kdhler and ut. Col. von Niederraayer. These Individuals broke away from the policy followed under the Republic which was interested in the East from an economic point of view only, and that to a liudted extent. hen in 1936 section VII of the Propaganda ministry instructed )r. hudi Kbhler and the archaeologist Jr. Kurt filers to submit to the Ministry a memorandum containing suggestions regarding the broad lines of the propaganda to be carried on in the hast, the r.aat received a place within the power zone (iaaohtraxim) of the Third Reich. In &amp;ay 1935 these two experts submitted to the Propaganda ministry a memorandum . • •oiemorandutu entitled ’•Space x*olic/ - Julture olic/ f, (xteumpolitik-Kulturpolitix). In thla iiie&amp;oj’&amp;iuluui, the I contents of thlch wers unrceervedl^ approved the of sections 4 and 7 of the Aiinlatr^ and especially by the then State secretary -hink, the Joint authors put forward the following argument t the natural space (reum) of Germany conoiBwS oi the lialiana anu the .uast• G? i*nian^ruu8t possess this apace, just as Franoe ^nci England have their spaces, i.e. Economic space / .iitsch&amp;i taraum;. ter the expression ’’economic apace*’ was replaced by the expression *vital apace” (^ebenaraum) which was invented by the vconomist von Hatssl, but in a quite different connexion. Only a large scale culture propaganda could prepare the ground in this apace for an economic hegemony. The political aims were only hinted at. The propaganda Ministry adopted tnia line of policy and instructed the President of the juarketing .j&gt;oard of German Industry to participate in cultural propaganda (it is notorious that the Marketing hoard (rVerberat) of German Industry is in fact an oxvanis tion- for economic espionage. There are still autnoriaed merchants* (^iplomkaufleute) who work in Istanbul on behalf of the German Marketing &gt;oard), A comparison between the contents of this document with the occurrences of recent years cl^ arly dsi.onstrates that its proposals have been carried out. van to-day the German Government follows the plan laid down in the memorandum In that German scientists are left in Turkey and that cultural work is being carried on in Fersia with the greatest energy-. In order not to overstep the limits of this document one cannot do more than give descriptions in chronological order and divided up according to countries, of the activities of . inis try in astern countries. «n invitation to a number of Turkish Journalists to ■ emanyGemany in 1935 - on which occasion they wera reoeivad by the F&amp;hrer - was to be the beginning of large scale propaganda activities in Turkey. Seldom has a government gone to as much trouble as did the German Government in the case of the Turkish journalists earl^ in 1935. The trip was ar» ^nged by the Foreign Club (.vusslandsKlub) with the collaboration of Herr von ,.*onteton of the Foreign /Tab and Herr Knothe of tie Propaganda inistry. kore than 14 nurfciah journalists took pai’t and were accompanied by the i reas Attach! of the German /tubasay in \ngora, Jr. Schiriidt-Juraont. Herr Knothe succeeded in m^kin, contacts with some Istanbul journalists which lasted &amp; consider ble time. (In view of the persona involved, soiie of whom have already terminated these contacts, their naraos cannot be mentioned). Before the visit of the Turkish journalists to Germany Dr. hoebbele had expressed his annoyance thi t the principal leader-writer of the Istanbul newspaper “Ctimhuriyet ', Yunus Nadi, although he had been a guest on the leppelin journey, had shown himself hostile* to Germany alter his return to Turkey. For this reason Sections 4 and 7 attributed the greatest importance to the winning over for German propaganda of the leader writers of the “Cdmhuriyet*’. It should be here noted thtit Herr von jacsewltz played the part of intermediary in the bribing of the u Chmhuriyet. .he favourable recognition in the Turkish press of the Turkish journalist^ visit to Germany cannot be contested. At the same time an attes.ipt was made by bribing some of the less important journalists to rope in the Istanbul news papers 'Istanbul', 'Buyoglu' and 'Journal d’Orient'. A young student who signed himself /inrullah and who 6n his mother’s aide was of Italian descent (his mother was Countess di Boccaccio) was persuaded to publish articles favourable to Germany in the 'Istanbul”. At about the same time he sent to tht; jropa e anda -inistry a more or less valueless description of conditions within the t t •the Turkish press. This youn^ Ju-imaiist was also raceiTed by inussolini and Interapereed his pro-Geman articles with those of a pro-Italian character. military and economic espionage in Tur Key is carried on ;r. icudi dhler in collaboration with Capt. .estphal of the v»ar Ministry and the resident of the ^ercuan . conomy.(si The 1 resident of the German Economy at that t ime was Minister* ialdirektor Reinhardt. Nothing is known to the writer of the results of this activity except that it is certain that the counter espionage department in the ministry of *ar in 1936 secured important material relating to Turitey which was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for translation, to be worked up at the Ministry of Propaganda. striking feature of the whole propaganda activity of the Third Reich in Turkey is that the ropaganda Ministry did not follow up their contacts with Falih Aifki atay and the then Director of the Press, Vedat Ncdim T6r but relied upon other contacts in Istanbul and wht was to by the * inistry of Foreign Affairs rejoined th^t they had roped in much more import nt people in Turkey than Salih Rifki Atsy or Vedat Kedim ?6r. hilc attempts were being made to influence the Tu kish press on the lines laid down in the memorandum 'Space .olicy - Culture 'olicy'*, endeavours were likewise made to iniiuence educational centres by sending out Lectors and men of science. The Lectors before leaving for A urkey were put through an trrtruction&amp;l camp (dchulungslagerj and also received from the Cultural and Folifcical Cepai traent of the German acudeciy Pt fjunich a considerable allowance, frequently equal to their salary. The attempts made to catch Turkish students by means of propaganda carried on by the cultural institutions in Germany and those under the direction of the Oriental dociety (Orientverein) are well known. Moreoveroreover one need oni# read the memoranaum ’’opace -olicjr - Culture ollcy* In order to recogniee the Ceruan propaganda activity In Turkey. In this connexion the build- ing up of the party organisation in Turkey Is worthy of mention. Herr von Havemann was entrusted with this aaty by the i-'oreign .'epartom-nt of the 'A.3. in 19TT, In which he was assisted by Lector ivoebel. he party organisation In Turkey was so constructed that it could aerve as a propaganda centre should the Propaganda ministry so desire. The leader in Turkey (-andslelter) reotlved communications from Section VII of the Propaganda Ministry through the intermediary of the kabasay and passed them on to the various subordinate organisations (dt»llen|und dlock- Iciter). The Press AttachS. Dr. Schraldt- uraont had funds at his disposal for the collection of information about internal conditions in Turkey* Section III In ggypt in 1934 propaganda activities huu alresoy started on a large scale. Section VII of the Propaganda Ministry took steps through the medium of the Oriental Society to influence the Cairo paper 'a 1 halagh'. The journalist Al Oalal was roped In for Oer.nan propaganda in Berlin. A young Egyptian writer Kahmoud .,1 Sadati. an assistant librarian at the otate ibrary, entrusted with the drawing up of the biography of Hitler. This appeared in 1934 and was very favourably counted by the Egyptian press. The Uerman Legation, acting through the Press Attache Homeyor bought up part of the edition and distributed it. The party organisation was thrust into the foreground more in Egypt than in any other oriental country and played a greater part/ in propaganda activity than section 7. The notorious Jew trial in Cairo was however worked uo by Bection 7 and von Dewerg.r with the assistance of ..ryptians in the background. The well know* lawyer Grimm • • aGrimm was sent to ^gypt. ihe Jew trial at Cairo, however, had moreover internal political interest. ,.ewerger was sent as the reporter of the 'Vtilkiseher Geboachter'* to Kgypt and the paper published reports of the trial on the front page und^r gigantic head lines. The ropaganda Ministry endeavoured to persuade the German readers that wotl* opinion was irritated at rhe impudence of the Cairo Jews who had slandered the German colony. The wording up of this trial in the German press constituted a preparation for the pogroms which took place later on. Ip Berlin the correspondent of the above mentioned paper, w Al Bala fc h H , had suggested to him all the slogans used by the rropaganaa ministry in its pamphlet w The Cairo Jew Trial*. ^n edition of this pamphlet running into several hundreds of thousands was distributed in Germany. The Culture and Political department of the iilnistry of foreign affairs worked hand in hand with section 7. In 1936 Wagner festivities and literary meetings took place in Cairo with propaganda as their object. The Egyptian minister at Berlin was sufficiently naive, or sarcastic, to h*nd over to the ministry of &lt;oreign iffairs the press reports of these events. In 1936 Jchwarz, the party leader in j gypt, received instructions to get into touch vvith Egyptian v/riters w5 th a view to producing a translation of 'Mein Kampf' in , rabic. As Hitler was greatly interested in the translation of his book into ail foreign languages of importance, the Chancell ery took the initiative in the matter. The first attempts to produce a translation, in the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the fropagan a Ministry, turned out very baaly and the Chancellery became suspicious and left out the name of the translators when the manuscript was sent up to be read in proof. The first partial translation of 'Mein Kampf' appeared in the Iraq newspapers called *Al ^.lem” and 'Gl Arab!' in Bagdad. It had cost the Chancellery more than GO,000 laafcks. The • a(!S) The other well known translation appeared subsequently, further, In 1936 the Egyptian writer dischr F^res wea paid to publish some articles friendly to Germany in the dorian futuristic pewapaper called M dl Hadish”. ivt the same time the •‘•'hird Reich made secret contacts with the Yemen and Saudi vTabia by sending out a young raan of letters, Dr. -chlubes, under the aegis of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. section IY Dropaganc-a in Iran was directed by Mr. A.urt Eilers with the support of Section 711 of the Propaganda ministry, the Culture and Political department of the kinietry of Foreign affairs and the ministry of .ducatlon. At the beginning of the propaganda activity in Iran in 1934 the illustrated weekly 'Iran - e Bastan' was put into the service of the German propa,anda. The owner and princip al leader writer of this paper Sheikh Seif Azad received a monthly subsidy of 2,000 marks from the Gtnii n Minister at Tehran. He published all the i^ihrer’s speeches i n extenso and //as reputed to be the H j. icture Tadio” of Iran. Nazi propaganda with this paper constantly succeeded in getting into the Imperial ralace at Tehran, the Goleetan. The daughters of the Dhafe were the nost assiduous readers. Sheikh Geif nzad fell into disgrace at Merlin because he had sent an open telegram to his contact in Berlin, kajor von Viebahn, in which Oeheimrat Heyde w&amp;s mentioned by name who was in charge of - ropagands Ministry payments abroad, t-conomic espionage in Iran was unaer the management of the mad of the German Iranian commercial company, one Pichts- meyer. The orientalist r rofeesor Walter lins, participated in cultural propaganda. In 1936 he travelled to fersia andI and received a oecoration from the ohah. ‘&lt;'or a time the Foreign i olitical department worked on a plan for creating a German Iranian culture society, with the support of the department of florid Philosophy (Weltanschauung) and of Professor Rosenberg. ihis plan did not corae to fruition, The most consider? ble and most successful activity in Iran was achieved by the German press Itself. all German newspapers received instructions to write only laudatory articles about the dhah. At a press conference in inarch two pa ( es of typescript drawn up by the Persian Minister bol Ghaesen Nadsehom containing a biography of the Ghalft were cofamunicat^d to the press with instructions to conform to it from then on. as the propaganda ministry had been able to flatter the vanity of the dhah muzzling the press, the Third Reich was very favourably looked upon in Iran. The German camera man, the well known Axel von Grttfe was the first person to receive permission to photograph the Imperial family at Tehran and the impress and the Mncesses unveiled for the first time. The book of pictures published by the Atlantis press under the title 'Iran, Hew er8ia ,, , with an introduction by the then minister for Foreign Affairs, von Neurath, is one of the most notable achievements of Nazi propaganda. Axel von Grftfe received e subsidy of 10,000 marks. Axel von Gr&amp;fe brought back from Fersls a copy of the General Staff map of Iran which was printed by the British War Office during the f orld ; ar. as regards cultural propaganda see the memorandum 'Space Policy Culture Policy* section on ersia. opctlon V The German Indian news service must be regarded as a special achievement of the Propaganda ministry. The Head of the Indian section of the Oriental society, £ajor von Koss, created this service at the time when as head of the Indian section of the •tlliance Insurance Company he converted the Indian ...Indian agencies of this company into propaganda centres of the Third Reich. In the autumn of 19-36 ^r. Goebhels received the i^eaaer of this organisation, an Indian - i)r. elma, and gave him instructions regarding his fui*ther activities . **ith him was for a time associated the Indian writer Akdur Rauf kialik who wrote for the ‘Titar of India' 1 and for two papers appearing in Hindustani. In 1936 and 1937 the Head of the Indian department showed by means of statistics that M three thousand articles favourable to Germany hud been pumped Into the Indian press.’. .mother instrument of Nazi propaganda, by name Habib ur .ahman is in Berlin. He. writes from Berlin for several Indian papers and is ?tolerated by the Propaganda Ministry. flection V I There remain to be mentioned the Turkestan emigre paper 'Yash Turkestan* which is supported by the Propaganda Ministry as also the Azerbaijan emigre paper rt Milli Kurtulush* which is illegally smuggled over the Joviet frontier with the assistance of the Reich ana which have as their object the furtherance of a national revolution against the Goviet government. kn eloquent comment on the o;cow Pact of Herr von kibbentrop!Please see I.P.I.’s note at P.&amp; J.(S) 249/40. I attach a note of a conversation with the Imperial Policy Group’s observer in Persia. To 3 wMr. Curie called on me today 'by arrangement with Mr. de Courcy of the Imperial Policy Group. Mr. Curie, who speaks a little Persian, has been acting as observer in Persia for the Imperial Policy Group and was responsible for the report published in the January issue of the Group’s 'Memorandum on Foreign Affairs' to the effect that about 20 Germans a month were passing through Persia on the way to Afghanistan, many of whom were carrying bales of anti-British leaflets printed in English. Mr. Curie’s information struck me as being of a somewhat vague and indefinite nature. He had entered Persia from Iraq and had spent some time at Tehran. He visited the Afghan Embassy at Tehran where Germans were trying to obtain travel documents for Afghanistan. His impression was that, while these Germans sometimes met with difficulties in entering Afghanistan, they usually succeeded in the end in obtaining the necessary Afghan visas. Mr. Curie said there were about 3,000 Germans in Tehran at the beginning of the war but that their numbers had now been reduced to about 600. I asked Mr. Curie what he meant by 'bales' of leaflets and he said he meant a few hundred at a time. These were distributed by the agents to Germans in the various places through which they passed. He mentioned a map said to have been found on a British airman brought down in Germany. This map was dated 19^5 and showed bombable areas in Germany, and was used to prove that Britain had long intended to go to war against the Germans. Mr. Curie had not visited any place in Persia east of Tehran. He had heard, however, that the Turkomans on the Perso—Soviet frontier were discontented with Persian rule and an easy prey to Soviet propaganda. Mr. Curie also spent some time in the Tabriz area and, sb out/atoout the beginning of December, he visited a Persian frontier post on the Turkish frontier near Bayazid. There Germans were entering Persia to the number of about 20 a month though there were also a certain number of Germans, say 5 a month leaving Persia in the opposite direction. He thought that this traffic had now ceased. On his way home Mr. Curie met a Russian at Istanbul who had recently escaped from Russia. This Russian informed him that the Soviet Government were now sending reinforcements of troops to their Middle Eastern frontiers. I should not feel inclined to attach very much importance to Mr. Curie’s information.I enclose a corrjr of the extract I mentioned to you the other day from the January issue of the H Memorandum of Information on Foreicrt Affair’s' publis^d by the Imperial Policy Group, ^3 Cld ucen Jtreet, 3* under the Editorship of a man na r ed de Courcy* e have no infer ation here to corroborate the details given regarding the trans ort through Iran by Gemans of b les of nnti- British leaflets intended for distribution in India and feci it night be worth while to make some enquiries from the Imperial Policy Group with a view to testing the accuracy of the story, before we decide whether to pass it on to India* e have had no dealings here with the Imperial Policy Group and feel that it might be better if any enquiries in this case were made by t!ie Foreign Office* *&gt; o should therefore be most grateful if the s Department would be good enough to approach the Imperial Policy Group on our behalf* FI I. • . -1 • *—j i.' ■, • f Northern cpartr.cn t.

It is somewhat on the lines of Commander Stephen King-Hall's K-H Letter. In the January issue (25.1.40) there is a passage which deals with the transport through Iran of German propaganda intended for India. I enclose a copy of the extract in question, and should be glad to know whether you or the Political Department have information which would tend to corroborate this report. If not it is for consideration whether we should not make some enquiries from the Imperial Policy Group with a view to testing the accuracy of the story before warning India.

His views about this time were anti- v 3olshevist and pro-German. Many of the advertisements in the special edition of the , Iran-e-Baatan T ana in in his latter newspaper 'Salar-e-Kind' have been from German firms. In the early part of July, 1938, the German Consul in Bombay was understood to be pressing him for the repayment of his debts in Germany. But he made up with him recountij^, all he had done for Germany in the past ana showing his readiness to still serve that country. The German Government is understood to have liquidated his liabilities soon after this. After July, 1938, he was noticed visiting the German Consulate and later he was reported to have secured Rs. 1000/- from the German firms of the Haverc, Rs. 250/- from the A.2.G. and Rs. 250/- from the Krupps, ostensibly as payment for advertisement in his paper, but really as a subsidy for the Naxi propaganda in which he was deeply interested* In connexion with this Nazi propaganda, he receives pro paganda literature through German agents in Bombay. It is learnt that he has been subsidised by the Nazi party to publish an Urdu version of the life of Hitler, and to re start his paper, the 'Salar-e-Hind'. He was noticed recently (about June, 1939) to be visitir^ the Gerirnn Consul ard. to be in touch with the leading Nazi agents in Bombay. He is reported to be an active pro-Nazi propagandist for the East. In September, 1938, he is reported to have printed an illustrated paper, called 'Salaz-i-Hind', which was all about Mysore and the good done by the Mysore ruling family.He also printed a book called ’Modern Inaa* by Fref.

The cover of the 'Salar-i-Hind” bore a number of Swastika signs* On 24.5*39 it was reported that Saif izad received two pro-German and anti-British articles through the agency of the Hansa Line Office in Bombay* On 29th June, 1939, it was reported that Seif Azad was in touch with Lesczynski and was understood to be visit ing the Indo-German Institutes at least twice a week* He styles himself as a National Socialist Aryan and states that modern civilization had only two enemies - Communism and Japanese. He said he would rather call himself^ German Nazi than an Indian slave and that his mission was to root out communism from India and save the country from civil war and poverty and that the latest issue of his paper (Vol*I, No. 2 - June 1939 issue) is a dedication for the cause of the fight against communism* He observed that newspapers were ’colouring* the whole matter about the good Germans xhsa whose help may save India f rom slaverj and chaos. He said that he had known Dr. Urchs and Lesczynski in Geriinny and that he and Dr. Urchs had fought in the Great far for the Germans* He added that Lesczynski was a thick friend of his even in Germany ana that there were two or three German - speakiqg Indians who too were National Socialists like him interested in the starting of a new movement (a literary one) to make the Indians military minded* Cn •»•/—^ On 22nd June, 1939, after the '7o; Conference”, Seif Azad accosted Subhas addressed him in German,.

No.309 [of September 6: departure of Germans for Persia and Afghanistan]. SECRET . You will have seen that numerous Germans are also said to be leaving India for Persia and Afghanistan. 2. In the last war German agents created immense trouble for H.M.Government and the Government of India in these two countries, and it is to be feared that attempts will be made to foment similar troiiie during the present war. 3. In Persia the circumstances are fortunately somewhat different, inasmuch as there is now a strong central government in the place of a weak and inefficient government; and scb long as the Shah sees no reason to depart from the attitude of neutrality which he has already adopted, I presume that he will give short shift to any German attempt to indulge in propaganda or intrigue. 4. The effect which the Soviet-German Pact is likely to have upon this problem will not have escaped you. It is quite possible that the Soviet Union may now afford transit facilities for German agents both to Persia and Afghanistan, and also contribute agitators of their own. It may, however, be possible to some extent to turn this new factor to account by playing on the fear of Bolshevism of both the Persian and the Afghan Governments. 5. I realise that, in the case of the Persian Government this must be done with great discretion; but if opportunities of doing so occur from time to time, I rely on you to take them. You might be aUe to point out that, owing to the sinister alliance of the National Socialist and Communist s » s tasystems German agents must henceforth fall under suspicion of waking hand in glove with Soviet agents, and hence he a source of direct danger to Persia as well as to Great Britain. 6.

My Lord, With reference to my despatch No. 287 of 13th June, I have the honour to report that a member of my staff recently enquired from Major Wilkins what results had been achieved by the Iraqi Police departments which, earlier in the year, were charged with the task of watching the German Legation and all Germans whose activities gave rise to suspicion. 2. Major Wilkins said that much useful basic information had been collected. The card indexes had been brought up-to- date and careful records of the movements of German subjects in various parts of Iraq had been compiled. The observations of the police had not, however, brought to li$it any important German political activities or widespread propaganda. Major V/ilkins also said that he had investigated reports that German propaganda agents were active in Basra and in Southern Kurdistan, but had been unable to obtain any information confirming such reports. 3. The truth, I suspect, is that the German Legation is too clever to employ methods liable to detection by the police. The most useful field for German activities is undoubtedly the two pan-Arab organisations, the Muthanna Club and the Palestine Defence League. There Germany enjoys much good will and many Iraqi adherents of the pan-Arab and anti-Zionist movements welcome G erman help in any form. It is in these circles too that it is easiest to work up hatred of/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.G.I.S. , etc., etc•, etcof G-rest Britain By means of stories of British atrocities and oppression in Palestine and to stimulate resentment against the Government for the restraint which it imposes on agitation in Iraq against British policy in Palestine. 4. It is also reasonably certain that, through the German-trained Dr. Ruwaiha, who is a prominent member of the Iv'uthanna Club, the German Legation keeps in close touch with all the leading extremist nationalists and also with the two refugee Palestine guerilla leaders, Fauzi Kawokji and Arif Abdul Razzaq. It is, however, difficult to discover what plots, if any, are being hatched by these men. 5. The Prime Minister complained to the Oriental Secretary a few days ago of the constant trouble which was being caused by German activities and said that he had decided to tell Dr. Ruwaiha that he must either give up his intrigues with the Germans or leave the country. Ruwaiha has, however, many friends in high places and I fear that even the Prime Minister will find it difficult to carry out such a threat. I have, etc., (Sgd.)

With reference to my despatch No. 394 of July 21st, I have the honour to report that the German Government are maintaining pressure on the Iraqi Government in order to obtain from them permission for Dr. Jordan to return to Iraq next Autumn. 2. The Head of the Protocol Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Oriental Secretary recently that a short time ago the German Government had, with some difficulty, persuaded the Iraqi Government to appoint a Minister to Berlin and had then refused an ✓ agr&amp;nent unless the Iraqi Government would first give an undertaking to allow Dr. Jordan to return next October. Tahsin Qadri said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had refused to give such an undertaking and had been annoyed by the German demand. He added that it was clear that the Germans were making the return of Dr. Jordan a matter of prestige, and that Dr. Jordan was strongly supported by the Party in Germany. Tahsin Qadri also related in confidence that he had spoken very frankly to Dr. Grobba before he went away on leave. He had told him that the Iraqis wanted to have friendly relations with all foreign countries but they would not tolerate foreign representatives who tried to play a role in the internal politics of Iraq. Tahsin Qadri said that he was appalled by the extent to which the Germans had wormed their way into all sorts of political factions and that he had told Dr. Grobba plainly that the intrigues of the German Legation were pernicious and intolerable. The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G.,G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., 3 .2 3 . Dr. Grobta had said that his only aim was to he helpful.

Dr. Grobba had made all arrangements to go away on leave on July 13th and had even paid me an official call to say goodbye, when he went out of his way to express sootning views on the subject of Danzig. At the last moment, however, he cancelled his arrangements and Frau Grobba departed alone. The reason for this sudden change of plan was the subject of much speculation and it was not until I saw the Prime Minister several days later that I discovered the facts. 3. Nuri Said said that so soon as he returned from the Lebanon on July 15th Dr. Grobba had sought an interview and had explained that he had postponed his departure specially to make a personal appeal to the prime Minister to give permission for Dr. Jordan’s return to Iraq. Dr. Jordan was, he stated, writing a book on archaeology in Iraq and wished to return to complete it. The prime Minister told me that he had not been deceived by so transparent a pretext and had refused Dr. Grobba’s request. Dr. Grobba had then enquired whether this refusal meant that Dr. Jordan would be excluded permanently from Iraq and the prime Minister had replied that he did not wisn to say that Dr. Jordan would never be permitted to return but he could certainly not agree to his coming back until conditions had greatly changed for the better.

[E 3367/3367/34] Mr. Seymour to Viscount Halifax.—(Received May 9.) 39 i Copy No. 118 j-r / L , r i (^ ^ lI+jty.'Ah (No. 122.) My Lord, Tehran, April 19, 1939. I HAVE the honour to refer to Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen's despatch No. 425 of the 3rd October, 1935, regarding the activities of Germans and their influence in this country. Since that review was made, there has been a marked increase in the number of German residents in Tehran and the provinces, and a corresponding growth of German commercial, industrial and social activity. 2. It is difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the present size of the German colony in Tehran. It is certain that it has grown rapidly during the j last three years and is now believed to number not less than 800. The colony in 1 Isfahan now numbers about seventy, those in Tabriz and Ahwaz about twenty- five. The Anschluss, and the consequent addition of Austrians, would account in part for the recent increases. Czechs will now presumably swell the numbers still further, but in the case of the local Austrians, and even more so the Czechs, the gain in numbers seems to be offset by the loss of unity of purpose. It is difficult to see how so large a number of Germans, in Tehran at any rate, manage to find profitable occupations. Few are artisans; not more than a small propor tion are employed by the large German organisations here. The majority appear , to make a living independently as small shop-keepers or commission agents. 3. Mr. Sarell’s despatch No. 23 of the 23rd November last, of which I had the honour to transmit a copy under cover of my despatch No. 398 of the 16th December, described the organisation of the German colony in Isfahan. That in Tehran is organised on much the same lines under the leadership of Dr. Siems (at present in Germany), a leading medical practitioner of the town, whose influence with his community is strong. There exists here also the same pressure on individuals to conform, outwardly at any rate, to Nazi standards. Should any situation arise in which intrigue or propaganda could be conducted on a scale useful to German interests, there is little doubt that the German colony here, with its discipline and organisation, would be well equipped to conduct it. 4. It may be useful to mention here three Germans to whom my attention has been drawn by a reliable source as being suspected of doing work of a political or semi-political nature for the German Government:— (a) Erich Bohrnstorff, said to be a relation of Dr. Schacht. Bohrnstorff was employed before the war by Wonckhaus and Co. During the war he formed part of the Neidermayer Expedition. After the war he visited Iran on behalf of Hamburg houses. He is now in Iran as an agent of Ferrostahl, but is not their chief representative. The source considered this suspicious in view of Bohrnstorff's age and abilities. (h) Herr Repke, an official commercial representative of the German Government, who makes periodical visits to Iran. (c) Herr Petzmayer, an employee of the Iranian firm Pirayesh, which deals almost exclusively in German goods. The source considered that all of these exceeded their purely commercial responsibilities. 5. At the present time, however, there is little possibility of Germans, however well organised, engaging in political activity on an important scale. All foreigners are closely watched by the Iranian authorities, who are likely to be nervous at any display of propagandist activity by a foreign group. In Tabriz, where His Majesty’s Consul reports a recent intensification of German activity, two Iranians suspected of engaging in German propaganda were examined by the police. All clubs, Iranian or foreign, must be registered with the police, [605 i—7]and the names of the committee stated. As a further precaution, Iranians who employ foreigners are in many cases made to sign an undertaking that their employees do not engage in political activity. So long as the Iranian Govern ment continue to exclude foreigners from any position in the Administration in \ which they might directly influence policy, there is little prospect of Germans or any non-Iranians attaining a hold on the banking, education, or military | services of the country. It is true that since the annexation of Czecho-Slovakia Germany has become the main supplier of military material to this country. The Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs has, however, hinted that his Government are not pleased with this situation. 6. In general, any weakening of the central authority, resulting in a relaxa tion of official vigilance, would provide an opening of which the Germans here could and no doubt would take advantage. There is a potential danger, but it should not become actual unless the policy of the Shah is completely changed or unless his death occurs and is followed by a period of confusion. In the event of war, during the continuance of the present regime, it seems reasonably certain that Iranian vigilance will be still further increased, and that the first preoccupa tion of the Iranian Government will be to ensure its strict neutrality.

Bagdad. 11th April, 1939 My Lord With reference to my despatch No. 147 of April 6th, I have the honour to acquaint Your Lordship Tdth the following further information which I have gathered concerning the activities of the German Legation at Bagdad. 2. On the afternoon of April 4th, when the Prime Minister called at the Embassy to express the deep regret of the Iraqi Government for the murder that morning ol His Majesty's Consul at Mosul, His Excellency told me that he had reason to believe that the mob which had stormed the Consulate had been excited by agitators who had gone among them declaring that the English had killed King Ghazi. He also I said that the police had arrested several young men that morning in Bagdad who had been distributing typevrritten hand bills which contained similar allegations and that it was believed that these men had relations with the German Legation or with Dr. Jordan, a German archaeologist who was for a number of years employed in the Bagdad Museum and who now resides here ostensibly as the representative of a German society (said to be non-existent), but who is actually the local agent of the Nazi Party. He promised to keep me informed of developments. ^ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G*, G.C-S.I*, G.C.I.E., etc., etc. , etc.i/ discovered the existence of a society formed within the local Young Muslims 1 Association to foster Nazi principles among the Iraqi youth. The records of the society, including the minutes of its meetings and a list of members, had been seized, together with a quantity of propaganda literature from G-ermany, and some ten men had been placed under arrest. These papers are now being translated and will be studied by the examining magistrate in conjunction with the statements made by those who have been arrested. 4. Mr. Edmonds tells me that the Minister of the Interior, Naji Shaukat, whose family are known for their pro-German sympathies, has been much shocked by these revelations, and it seems true that the Iraqi Ministers and high officials are indignant that the German Legation should have so deliberately sought to embroil them in grave complications with His Majesty’s Government. 5. The Prime Minister has been most outspoken in his condemnation of Dr. Grobba’s conduct and declares that he will take drastic measures to put a stop to his activities. He has actually gone to the length of saying to me how much he would like to withdraw the Iraqi Legation from Berlin and tell the German Government to withdraw their representatives from Iraq. However, he may not revert to that idea just yet, for in the heat of the moment he is all too inclined to undertake a good deal more than he is able to carry out. The immediate measures which he proposes to take were reported in my telegram No. 15Q_ of April 8th, and I shall report in due course what in fact is done. I am afraid that he may find it much more difficult to be drastic than he imagines. But in order thatI may be in a position to advise him, shoul&lt; Dr* G-robba from Iraq (which I personally would welcome, as Dr. G-robba has been here far too 3.ong and has I understand now taken charge of all German propaganda, etc., in the Hear East) become necessary, I shall be grateful for the benefit of your views and to have Your Lordship’s instructions in the matter generally. 6. Everywhere people I meet are amazed at the extent to which the Germans have succeeded in poisoning the public mind, especially that of the student class, with anti-British sentiments, and their success must be attributed in the main to the skill with which they have exploited the hostile feelings which have been aroused by the long struggle in Palestine and latterly by the deterioration of the situation in Syria. 7. The Amir Zeid has spoken to me most seriously about the state of public feeling and his views have been echoed by many others including the well-disposed and experienced Sabih Hajib, who was so helpful as Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the last Madfai Cabinet, in which he later became Minister of Defence. Both said that the Prime Minister in conversation with them had shown himself fully alive to the dangers of the situation, and I believe that he is. But I am less certain whether he has the strength or continuity of purpose to deal with these dangers effectively. 8. The arrangements mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 of my despatch under reference are developing satisfactorily. Mr. Edmonds is at present confident that his Minister is taking/* % i .«r taking up the matter in the right spirit, and tells me that Saiyid Alv/an, the Commandant in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department, is collaborating closely and actively: both officers are keenly determined to round up the German Minister’s agents and propagandists. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Berlin, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India. I have, etc., (Signed) W.E. Houstoun-Boswall.COPY a (E 2648/77/93) is fto. 147. (136/3/39) Bagdad, 6th April, 1939. My Lord, \ In his despatch No. 626 of the 22nd December, 1938 Sir Maurice Peterson reported the conclusions which Taufiq- al-Suwaidi (then the Minister for Foreign Affairs) had reached concerning the activities of the German Legacion in Bagdad, 2. His successor, Nuri-al-Said, has soon formed a similar opinion. Before Sir Maurice Peterson 1 s departure, Nuri-al-Said mentioned more than once his suspicions that it was encouragement from the German Legation that had made the late King Ghazi so obstinately determined to meddle in the affairs of Koweit and during the last ten days he has several times discussed with me what he regards as being the accumulating indications of the existence of a widespread network of German political intrigue. He has spoken in , particular of the activities of a man named Hans (or Hugo) Steffan, who arrived in Iraq early in January as the agent of Krupps and certain other German arms manufacturers, Herr Steffan was warmly sponsored by the German Legation and quickly established personal contact with a number of officers in the Ministry of Defence, Nuri-al-Said now tells me that when martial law was declared in the Rashid cantonment on the 5th March, the Censor intercepted telegrams handed in by Steffan \ which indicated that he was in close relations with some of the officers implicated in the plot reported in my despatch No./ The Right Honourable Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc. , etc. , etc.No. 130 dated the 30th March. The Prime Minister says that thereupon he told the German Minister that Herr Stef fan's presence was no longer desirable in the country and I am told, though X have not yet confirmed this information, that he left Iraq a few days ago. 3. The revelations made concerning Steffan appear to have caused the Prime Minister some anxiety and just before King Qahzi's death he personally appealed to Mr. Edmonds, the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, and to Major Wilkins, a senior British police officer in the Criminal Investigation Department, to make arrangements for the close supervision of the German Legation and of all Germans whose activities give rise to the least suspicion. He also asked me to support his appeal on the ground that it was a common British and Iraqi interest to check German intrigues. also suggested that 'I' Branch of Air Headquarters should collaborate and I have informed them accordingly. 4. Mr. Edmonds and Major Wilkins are both of course willing to do their best but they have pointed out to me that for some time all executive authority in the Criminal Investigation Department has been taken out of Major Wilkin s hands and that it will be difficult for him at a moment's notice to organise an efficient branch of the Department to assist him in carrying out the work which the Prime^Minister now wishes him to undertake. I have mentioned these and similar points to the Prime Minister, who, I hope, will see that Major Wilkins is given the support he needs. 5. It is in my opinion most desirable that German activities should be watched and checked, and I shall do my best to see that the most is made of the opportunity which is/is afforded by the Prime Minister’s present attitude towards the German Legation. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Berlin, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India, I have, etc. , (Signed) V/. E 0 HOUSTOUN-BOSWALL..- 2 - School, which is under the managership of a German, Dr. Strunk, has been transferred from the control of the Ministry of iiaucation to that of the Department of Commerce. The former were always short of funds and the activities of the school suffered accordingly; but it is expected that the latter will now accora it more generous treatment. It is also now proposed to provide a German teaching staff for the new industrial schools which are being established at various centres in the provinces, and particularly at Isfahan, Meshed and Tabriz. I also learn that an order has recently been placed with Krupps for a quantity of mining equipment. Details are not available, but the contract is not unlikely to be connected with a scheme which is on hand to erect a foundry for manufacturing girders, pipes, &amp;.C., as 1 have learnt from another source that the proposal to give Tehran a proper water and drainage system has been held up owing to the insistence of the Shah that the pipes must be manufactured in this country. I would also invite attention to the report contained in the commercial secretary's G.T. (B) despatch Ho. 219 of the 19th September, that a German firm is negotiating for the quasi-monopoly of the export of the Hormuz red oxide for a term of two years, one of the conditions being that the Germans would start a monthly shipping service to Gulf ports, the ships to be manned to a great extent by Iranians. The attachment of a German engineer to the Iranian navy for dry-dock construction and the report that a German expert is being engaged to manage the newly-formed Iranian insurance company (see my despatch Ho. 428 E. of the 3rd October) are also signs of activity which deserve notice. The Iranian economic mission to Berlin, which formed the subject of my despatch Ho. 330 E. of the 26th July last, has been rather put in the shade by the more important mission which has just been visiting/visiting Leningrad for the iixhibition of Iranian Art, but the newspapers have more than once referred in this connexion to the importance of good relations between Iran and Germany, and doubtless the mission has succeeded in arranging a certain amount of business during its stay in Berlin. 4, Outside the commercial sphere it is difficult to give facts and figures, but the new German Minister appears to be very active in looking after the colony, being at home to them, I hear, every Friday. The illustrated paper Iran-i-Bastan is certainly subsidised by the Legation and is always full of pictures of Lazi Germany; and it is interesting to note that the Iran is now publishing an increasing number of photographs illustrating German doings. I have not heard of any subsidy being paid to the latter paper, but 1 should not wonder if it was being supported too. 5, In general, I have the impression that the modern type of Nationalist Iranian is inclined to aumire Herr Hitler and to compare him to the ShahJ It is known that the proposal to make us all talk of Iran in future instead of Persia emanated from the Persian Minister at Berlin, and I rather believe that the movement to aryanise the language, involving the change of all military titles and the giving of new names to Arab towns like Mohammerah, is to some extent also inspired by ideas drawn from German ideology. BYen the anti-clerical movement in Germany probably rather appeals to those here who are busy undermining what is left of Moslem religious feeling. 6, 1 have left to the last two very important aspects of the matter; one is the question of German influence in the army and the other the possiole repercussions on German policy of the diversion elsewhere of Italian energies. As to the first, the military attache states that German influence appears to be small, and 1 only mention it because my Belgian colleague voiced to/to me earlier this year his fears lest one day we should see a German military mission here. M.. Paternotte appeared to have no special grounds for his apprehension, except for a general fear that the Germans would seize any opportunity to step in wherever they could, but he said that he had warned the Belgian mission that they should be careful not to do anything which might antagonise the Ministry of */ar and bring about their dismissal. It was not, he had said to theip, their duty to be too exacting in their methods of training or too insistent that all their ideas should be accepted by the authorities. There was no question but that it was their job to give the Iranian air force the best training that was possible; but the important thing in the interests of Belgium was that the Iranian forces should draw their advisers from the ranks of the ex-Allies, and it was therefore essential that nothing should ever be done which would lead the Shah to dismiss them and perhaps put Germans in their place. 7, 1 have no information on the other point which I have raised, namely, the possible effect on German policy of Italian preoccupations in Abyssinia; I only desire at present to draw attention to it. His Majesty's consul at Ahwaz, who was recently in Tehran, told me that he had information that many of the Italian artisans who were employed on the railway were now returning to their own country, and, opinion here being decidedly anti-Italian in the Abyssinian conflict, it seems reasonably certain that a diminution of Italian influence and activity in Iran is now in sight, ho doubt the Germans will endeavour to seize the opportunity to press their own interests. 8, In conclusion, may I invite reference to Kabul diaries dated the 21st March and the B7th June last, which show that the Germans are being active in Afghanistan, and to the letter dated the B5th April last from Cairo Chancery to the Egyptian Department, which profides evidence of reviving German propaganda^ t/he 14ear Elast generally? 1 feel that these reports strengthen what is admittedly only a supposition on my part at the moment that the future is likely to bring an increase in German activities in this country. 9. 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin, Ho. 108 M.
