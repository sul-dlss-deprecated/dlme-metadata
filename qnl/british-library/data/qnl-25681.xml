He thought the three/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, LONDON, S.-W.l.three associated shipping companies interested (i,e. The Ocean Steam Ship Company, the 'Nederland' Mail Line and the hotterdam Lloyd) might gain a lot by reducing their rates, and particularly the Ocean Steam Ship Company, whose ships he suggests are the most popular on account of the friendly treatment pilgrims receive on board. 3* Seyyid Husein does not appear to consider it very probable thr^t the Japanese shipping companies will, as has lately been rumoured, capture the pilgrim traffic; in the first place they are not experienced in this traffic and the pilgrims prefer to travel by lines which are used to cater for their needs, and secondly, he felt that such an intrusion into the pilgrim traffic might meet with official obstacles in the Netherlands East Indies. Unless the three associated companies mentioned reduce their rates, however, there would be some risk that the Japanese could, by quoting a very low rate, attract many pilgrims who could not otherwise afford to make the Hajj. I have given Seyyid Husein an introduction to the local Representative of the Ocean Steam Ship Company, to whom he has submitted his views in this matter. 4. Seyyid Husein also referred to the political state of the Hadramaut. i* any of the clans, he said, were very tired of the wearying feuds that have persisted for so long, and a number of prominent Arabs there had addressed a signed request to him to use his good offices on their behalf to conciliate the warring/warring cla&amp;a. These feuds, he said, bore no relation to the differences between the Teyyids and Al-Irshad (which have been the subject of many previous despatches relating to Arab activities), and the petition he had received was signed both by Seyylds and non-£eyyids in the Kadramaut* After hearing the views of the important Arab communities in the Netherlands East Indies he proposes to see wh^t he can do to conciliate the clans on his return to Arabia; it is evident, therefore, that he still retains the aim mentioned in Sir A, Kyan^ despatch of February 18th, 19d4, quoted above, 5* In fact, Seyyid Eusein continued, the difference between Al-Irshad and the Seyyids was as yet of little importance In the Kadramaut itself; the Seyyid leaders here had attached quite undue importance to the matter ailuough, as he allowed, free entrance of Irshaai propagandists to the Hadramaut might well Increase trouble there, tfhile in Java he proposed to do all he could to reconcile the Seyyids and the Irshadis, and he had in fact suggested to some of the former that if they ignored the Irshadi contentions altogether instead of combatting them tne friction might die down in six months. Seyyid nusein clearly takes an unusually moderate view of the Irshadi quarrel for a feyyid, and may thus exercise a useful Influence among local Arabs,Copies to:- The Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign and olitical Department, New Delhi, The Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements, Singapore, ‘The Resident, Aden.

He has added that his legal advisers are uncertain that the refusal of a port clearance for no other reason than that the ship is clearing for Bir ’Ali is intra vires , but that there was a possibility that the issue of a port clearance might be of grace and not of right, and that there was also the possibility of refusal on the ground that Bir ’Ali, being described in the Gulf of Aden Pilot, 8th Edition 1932, as a village, could not possibly be designated as a ’’port' to which a clearance might be issued. 3 . He has further stated that in any case, whatever the legal position may be, he proposes to issue instructions to the Master Attendant that Port Clearances are to be refused to ships wishing to clear for Bir ’Ali, and that he would advise me of the / intermediate ports for which any ship clears alter being'being refused a clearance to 3ir f Ali. Should any protests arise on refusal of these port clearances, he would refer the matter to the Secretary of State for the Colonies for his ruling; and if it were decided that such clearances must he issued when asked for, it would he possible to submit all ships applying to clear for Bir ’Ali to so much attention and enquiry from the Marine, Police, Import and Export and Passport Authorities as to render similar applications in the future unlikely. In conclusion he has remarked that it would, however, he still possible for such a ship to obtain later at some port further west a clearance to Bir t Ali.

GGiu- IBAiMTliiu: Sir, I have the honour to inform you that a request has recently been addressed to local shipping companies by Arabs in Java for shipping facilities to the port of BIB Ahi, on the coast of the Hadramaut. This request emanates from the Society Aidjany ah Alhatieriyah (Al-Jamiuh Al-Kathiriyah) in East Java, which I am informed is an association of memoers of Al-hathiri tribes who are also memDers of the Al-Irshad Society. £. The possibility of Al-Irshad attempts to establish Bir Ali as a port in opposition to kakalla was already foreshadowed in paragraph 3 of my despatch No.34 Confidential of the Bath march, 1933, to the Foreign Office of which 1 then sent you a copy. An Arab informant of good standing tells me that a meeting of Al-Kathiris (who are also Irshadis) was held at Batavia a month or two ago, at which this proposal was discussed, the meeting favouring some arrangement for the purchase or lease of the x ^ort of Bir Ali. ine object was, he said, to have a ^ort where Irshadis could freely enter the Hadramaut without control either by the Al-Gayetti Sultan or the British authorities. 3^ The Bosident and Commander-in-Chiof, * U E a.°* It is said that Saleh Al Abdul ,/ahid, the owner of Bir All, is favourably disposed to the proposal, in viuvx of the increased revenues he may thereby receive, even though he is neutral in the differences between the Seyyids * (with 'whom the al-Gayotti Sultan is associated) and Al ii shad. An attempt has already been made some three years ago, it serins, to develop traffic into the interior of the Hadramaut via Bir Ali, but was frustrated by steps taken by bho Al-Gayetti Sultan to close the road, which went through his territory: it is therefore now; proposed to utilise a different route from Bir Ali, via Habban. The people of Habban are said to be very poor, and their sup.ort is con sequently purchasable with money and arms, while the Seyyids there are said not to haVv. realised the significance of the Al-Irshad movement. An Al-Irshad propagandist named Sheikh Omar bin Mohamad Al Shebli, who has a rich brother at Peka- longan, Java, is said to be now residing at Habban. 4. My informant xxkacc states further that the advocates of the proposal tried to secure thn. support of Sheikh Salim Balwail, an elderly, highly respected and wealthy Al-Kathiri Arab who resides at Buitenzorg, Java. He,however, r^fuse^L to give them any help, saying hu did not wish to con tribute to cause trouble. My informant suspects that arms smuggling is one of the- main reasons for th^ proposal, and contends that once the port of Bir Ali is opened arms will certainly be smuggled into the interior much more freely, In any case Irshadi propagandists and other supporters would utilise this KLx:fcte£ moans of entry into the Hadramaut for frustrating the efforts of the Makalla authorities to keep them out, and the chances of disorders in the Hadramaut would be much increased. 5. 1 /5* I hr.vc not yet received any formal request from shipping companies for authorisation for any of their vessels to visit the port of Bir Ali, hut should I receive any such application I shall, of course, refer to you be fore returning a definite reply. As you are no doubt u- ware, the practice arose in iSS 1921 whereby local shipping companies have alv/ays asked the authorisation of this Con sulate-General to call at Hn^ramaut ports (Reference a confidential letter addressed to you by this Consulatu-G^nor- al on July 1st, 1921). This practice has continued ever since, and will, I presume, also apply in the ^vont of Bir Ali being opened as a new port. 6. In the meanwhile, I should be grateful to receive from you an expression of your view as to the de sirability or otherwise of vessels from Java calling at Bir Ali,.the answer that should bo returned to any shipping companies asking authority for journeys to that p„rt, (e.g. in regard to the control of firearms), and tho con ditions to be attached to such authority if given.

He may be seeking a fresh field to conquer. I do not feel at all inclined to encourage Al-*Attaa in his inspiration to take part of your job.
