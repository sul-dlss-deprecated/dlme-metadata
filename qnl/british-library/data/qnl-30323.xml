B.M’s Consulate and Political Agency, MUSCAT. 11th August, 1951. (p 2/2/21/51. Landing Ground at Muscat. There appeass to Le some lack of* advertisement of the fact that the landing ground at Muscat is not ordinarily available to aircraft. Nor should any aircraft attempt to come there without first obtaining the permission of the Muscat Government. For this at least 48 hours notice is necessary, whilst permission is only likely to be given if the Sultan considers that the circumstances justify the special arrangements which use of the landing ground entails. No charge is made for this, add as the Muscat Government incurs expenditure upon patching up and generally getting the landing ground ready, and guards have to be sent out to clear the neigh bourhood, and stop all traffic, it will be appreciated that the proposed visit will normally have to be of interest to them, or of sufficient importance before they will give the permission. 2. As the requests, or, as sometimes happens, simply an announcement of arrival, usually come$ to me, I am placed in the position of having to make apologies and of rushing about, owing to the insuffic iency of time, trying to get in touch with the Sultan and his officials. I shall therefore, be personally grateful if such steps as are possible are taken to ensure that no aircraft will come here without permission, and that this will be applied for as much in advance as possible: -In no case leaving less than 48 huirs for action here after the request is received. It is particularly hard to get in touch *ith Sharjah and that airfield should, at least, have standing instructions to warn an aircraft not to visit Muscat without the Sultan’s permission. Apart from the question of propriety, it is actually very dangerous to attempt it , whilst the Sultan has said that he will detain an unauthorised aircraft landing in his territory, if he catches it. I thknk the regular air lines, and British and American Military Services may know all this well enough, and thevpeople to lookbut for are those using private or chartered aircraft. The most recent case, which is the one that prompts this letter, is in this category Vi/tw* ^ C. M.
