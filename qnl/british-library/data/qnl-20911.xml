TO H.H.Aneer Pysul Ruler of the Wahabees 8th Shaaban 1278. Dated 8th February 1862 A/C Two months and. upwards have elapsed since I addressed v our Highness enclosing certain terns which the Chief of Bahrein had solicited me to place before you as a friendly mediator between you and then, IJy object in undertaking that office was an earnest and particular desire to restore to ^ r our lis coast possessions and to those of the Chief of Bahrein the blessings of peace while having at heart its preservation for the general intersts of all in this Gulf, f 2. Tr our H, to the present tine has not favoured ne with a reply. My nediation I presune is therefore not approved As long however as I an not convinced on that point I hesitate to relinquish a cause so sacred as that above quoted,hence I make another and a last appeal that peace between '^our ,H# and the Chief of Bahrein nay be perfected# 3, This appeal seens the nore necessary as credible in- m formation has reached the Chiefs of Bahrein that your Highness• Agents'are active in sowing dissension amongst the tribes subject to Bahrein on the G-uttur coast .Anarchy at all events threatens there and the quiet of the Chiefs ^ and people of Bahrein being thus constantly disturbed some measures on their part seem to them imperative to counter- act machinations which while causing anxiety to every class engross all their attention by land and by sea, 4. Those measures are an open declaration of war and re- prisal against, Y.H's possessions and. vessels on the coasts of this Gulf.and independent as we recognize the Chief of Bahrein to be I shall I fear be unable to restrain hin fron the exercise of his legitimate rights and prerogatives after all efforts on his part and ray own have failed to -eve Y.H. to a Just appreciation of tranquillity in this Gulf2- ® T Tay it will be ny duty to respect and even uphold those rights and prerogatives when they are legitimately pro claimed and put in practice by sea. It renaihs therefore for to consider whether this last effort of nine to open a road to peace is of importance to you or otherwise. On silence or on your reply every thing will depend, as open war the Sheikhs assure me is preferable to the chronic , &gt; state of anarchy in which they and their subjects have live^/ for many years past.

Ii.H.Aneer Pysul iron the day that his protege Sheikh Mahoned bin Abdullah was forcibly ^ejected by the Political Resadent iron his retreat in Denaun Island,has ,it appears to ne,inaniiested a narked disinclination to exchange friend ly communications with this Residency at least such I gather iron H.HIs protracted silence. 3. Considering the anicable relations that heve so long subsisted between the Wahabeex Aneers and the British Governnent- considering too that the Wahabee Aneer is un doubtedly a tributary of the Porte,-I have observed with regret this seening change in H. H's sentinents. 4. 1 have recently addressed H.H. a courteous connuni- cation,gently sounding hin on the subject of forner media tory appeals subnitted tdi hin by Captain Jones, and I _ still possess hopes that H.H. nay feel disposed to flvour ne with a friendly reply. Should ny expectations be happily i7® realized,and should the tenor and tone of H.H's rejoinder afford ne a fair opening for the prosecution of amicable mediation,! shall use my best endeavours to bring about an equitable settlement of the quarrel so long existing. 5. The non-receipt of Zukat or religious tithe for a con siderable period is to my mind the chief source of irri tation to the Wahabee Ameer,and my ovm opinion is that une coulcl^Balirein Chief be persuaded to disburse this contribu tion with regftlarity,the Wahabee Airjeer would willingly cone to terns of peace and would cheerfully do his utmost to res train his subjects and proteges from molesting Sheikh Khuleefa's dependents and territories at Quttuy - &gt;and fron forming combinations inimical to the security of of Bahrein. 6. As regards the wild ^proposals tendered by Sheikh Llahomed bin Khuleefa to H.E.the Pasha of Baghdad you are better acquainted than I am with the flighty and capricious character of the Bahrein Chief,and I fe^l assured that it is simply necessary for me to submit for your information the reported nature of the proposals under reference. You will thus be enabled,should discussions arise,to reply to the Turkish Authorities in language calculated to counteract the evil effects that might otherwise possibly be produced • 7.

Sir, In continuation of my letter as per margin and ITo.899/258 d/ 14th August 1871 and other correspondence concerning the Turkish Expedition towards ITujd,! have now the honor to enclose translated purports of a series of reports whish I have received from one of the Residency lated 6th,9^k,7th, 8th, 10th and 11th August 1871 LIunshees detached to Bahrain for the of collecting intelligence. 2. Communication with Nujd is interrupted,and it see to be the policy of the Arab Leaders to conceal their inten tions and movements. But so far as relian.ce can be placed u upon reports received from many independent native sources it appears nearly certain that Abdullah bin Feysal has been killed in engagement with his brother Saood and that the latter has been wounded. 3. It is circumstantially stated that the brothers fought on two occasions. On the first occasion Saood was compelled to fall back on his friendly Tribes. On the second occasion,the action was still undecided,and the life of Saood was in imminent peril -when one Roughan-Chief of the Ejman Tribe-rushed upon Abdullah and killed him. 4. It is alleged that Abdullah craved Quarter, but that the El man Chief replied 'you killed my father and my son,and I have sworn that I will kiii not leave the field until I have killed you f ♦ The Chief then despatched Abdullah. 5. As regards the wound of Saood it seems uncertain whether it be mortal. The latest reports pretend that the wound is slight^and that Saood has returned to Riadh with intent to proceed thence to Lahsa. 6. As regards the position oi the Turkish force — ife its Commander seems to have become uneasy about his rear* and this would be accounted for by the Abdullah,which wouldvirtually close the Civil War,and strengthen the position of the surviving Brothet whether at the Capital or anong the Bedouins. 7. It is certain that the Turkish Comrnepider recently called for reinforcements from Kateef,and that from 2 to o hundre men have be©n pushed on thence and from Ojair toward Lahsa. 8. Some of the Arab Contingent that accompanied the Expedition seem to have been recalled towards the Forth - probably on account of the rising among the bribes near the Tigris and Euphrates. 9. I roughly estimate the present strength of the Turkish Commander as follows:- Turkish Troops. In the Fort of Kateef of whom perhaps 150 sick,. 500 At Ojair 150 Re-inforcements en route to Lahsa ,.250 Head Quarters in and around the Forts of Lahsa of whom 1000 sick 2500 Total Strength o400 Deduct Sick 1150 Effective 2250 But this Estimate probably overstates the Total Sterngth and understates the number of Sick. The Arab Contingent may number a couple of thousand men. 10. I think the death of Abdullah vail increase the eV chance of treachery on the part of the Arabs towards the Turks. 11. The trading classes at Lahsa and on the coast probably prefer the comparative social liberty of the Turkish rule to the strictness of the Wahabee rule. But the Bedouins,the religious classes,and the men of consequence in central Arabia generally will never,I think,willingly accept permanent Turkish domination. 12. • I entertain little or no moral doubt that theplan and original movement; of 'the Turkish. Expedition, con- templated 'bhe occupatyion of Banrein,and 'bhe extension ox direct Turkish Influence 'towards Lluscat. fhe Bribe to the Kov/ait Chief was to have been found in Bahrein. Hence the heavy Contingent,and the three hundredcraft which acconpani the Expedition from Kowait. 13. It is satisfactory to report that dov/n to date the tranquillity of Bahrein ahd of the Littoral Chieidoms i in general remains undisturbed,that the Maritime Truce has not been infracted,suid that British Interests on the Arab Coast remain uninjured. 14. Guttur,however,is overrun by the Bedouins not- ft- withstanding that the Turkish Flag flies at ElBiddeh, And it is alleged that on a recent occasion when the Turkish Authorities invited the Kowait Chief to visit the Huttur Coast he excused himself. 15. I beg to enclose copies of Telegrams which I have Dated 16th, 17th and 22nd August 1871 already submitted on the subject of this letter. I have &amp;c. sd/ L. Pelly Lt. Col.

From News Agent Bahrein To The Political Resident Bushire• A /C This is the copy of a letter received fron HaJ Husun Jishee at Cruttur by Shailth Fahad bin Ahmed of Bahrein and dated 9th October. 1 'According to what I have ascertained the going of ITasi bin LIubaraS to Guttur has been ordered or caused by Bazee vfh.o had v/ritten o letters to . T asiiii to the following effect The first letter I iniorn thee Oh Tasini that j r asir bin Mubarak will con to you and you must take care of him for the sake of the tranquillity of the country and the security of the people. Give him money for his expenses which are all chargeable to the Turkish Government. Hussun Jishee says that Tasim wishes to make LTasir bin Mubarak ruler of Guttur and has issued a notification that Tasir will be Governor and Jasim his Assistant and that ITasir will live in a house near the Fort A1 Musallam in which formerly resided the Aimer Fasir bin Jabar now pro ceeded to A1 Hasa. Second letter from Bazee to Jasim .oar letter is to hand and its contents are understood The Turkish Government are deeply indebted to you for wha ^ oj- Lave done out at present nothing can be done as regards Bahrein or an^, other place until the views of the Turkish Government are known• Vessels of war will shortly reach Bahrein and the Arab Coast,they will call at your port and-v infornation will be furnished to you. As regards the English and T/hat they have done and their firing cannon ih Ottoman territory — these acts have been reported and an answer such as is in our heart will be received. Think not highly of the English for their power is subservient to that of the Sultan — nay they are his servants and held in contenpt by him. Pep adventure he will oust then fron the sovereignty of the Sen 11 . In Bazee's previous letters he wrote to Jasi m •'you in volved ne and yourself*'and blamed him much and he wrote per- viously to the Amser (his Agent) to subjugate the ITaeem tribe and attck them in concert with the Beni Hajar. The third letter from Bazee to Jasim. r - r our letter has reached me. You write you are not indepen dent and that your power is controlled but soon you will behold that which will delight you and no person shall do you harm. Hussun Jishee also writes in the same letter '•Let not th the bhaikhs of Bahrein be deceived if letters of different pur port to the above should reach tham from Bazee• 1 . Let them be watchful and on their guard. Par and near precautions should be taken against j T asir bin Mubarak and those from whom aid may be expected should be informed of what has occurred. The .Taeem will suffer when ITasir joins the Beni Hajar and they will doubtleaa commit all kin^s of violence and robbery. Muhammad oin baud and his dependents the A1 Bukwara have fallen out and they desire some other Chief. Hussun Jishee frequently repeats in his letters that the Bahreenees should be careful and on their guard. I hear that in the Fort A1 Musallam at Kutr there are some 00 Turkish Soldiers under the orders of Jasim and that the per son who came to make inquiries on behalf o the Turks ii. one 01 their vessels was sent by Bazze,his name was Ali Be.v and he was Captain the same vCsselNo. 152 of 1874.

A/C Be it known that Sheikh Esau bin Alee has sent his brother Khalid with Rashid bin Jabar Chief of the Naeem ina a boat to Khor Hassan because the tribe of ITaeen at Zobarah are in great fear of ITasir bin Mubarak and I hear the Beni Iiajar and other tribes such as the Manasir and A1 Morrah ari and others are still folcking to him. It is reported that they intend a raid on Bahrein as on a recent previous occasion. It is said that when ITasir consulted with Bazee he in tended only to attack the Faeem,destroy them and deprive them of their best horses to send to A1 Hasa. The object of Sheikh Khalid's proceeding to Khor Hassan is to reassure Esau bin Khaleefa A1 Chabisa and his tribe and to induce them to take shelter in Zobarah. These Chabisa are seafaring people and some 400 in number.I hear that previous to Khalid's arrival at Khor Hassan Ahmed bin Katan visited the Chabisa tribe and took them to Zobarah, The Chabisa formerly lived in Zobarah on equal terms w ftith the Kaeem and in amity with them. Some dissension however recurred and they quitted the place but they have now returned and made Up their quarrel.1380 Ko. of 1874. 288 Busliire Btih December 1874 To The Secretary t® the Government of India Foreign Department, Calcutta.

It is reported from good sources that the whole distri of El Hasa including the Fort had fallen into the hands of Abdul Rahman bin Feysal and the Turkish Governor(Bazee) and his force had surrendered to quarter.

You very probably replied that you could only interfere to repress novenents by sea. The Chief then asked to be allowed to reinforce the garrison of Zobarah, which he considered a dependency of Bahrein: and you advised hin to keep as free as possible fron the f fe&amp;ds on thd mainland: but said that you would not inter fere with the despatch of reinforcenents to Zobarah as a purely defensive neasure, leaving the Chief to decide up on the necessity or expediency of such action, and enjoi ning hin carefully to abstain fron taking any part in ope rations in which the Turkish Governnent was engaged. ~ The Governor General in Council observes that by the correspondence marginally noted j-4j ahorei it was shown that the Chie of Bahrein had no possess- TT o. 1115/135dated 4th Sebt.1373 'o.1191/147 dated 19th do. do. ions onthe nainland of Guther,and that his rights there were oi a very uncertain character.

On that occasion I inform ed you that though I would not interfere with the despatch of reinforcements if purely for defence that it was a matte for your own consideration as to the expediency of the measure as affecting your interests and that the British Government could not undertake responsibility for results if you interfered on the mainland and got mixed up in com plications there, I took the opportunity td) repeat to you the advice you have so often received from the British Resident to keep clear Ox -lie leuds on the mainland and especially to avoid giving offence to the Turkish Government, Having reporbed the nature of this conversation to the Government of India,I am instructed by Government that if you should take any part in complications on the mainland the British Government will not guarantee you protection. As this is a matter of importance I have deemed it in accordance with friendship to inform you at once of the decision of Government and I therefore have deputed Captain I 1 ra^er bo proceed in a Government vessel on a visit to you with this letter,in order uhat you may fully understand the decision of Government, X trust you are well and that you will inform mo of your welfare in all respects and of all occurrences tcheneve opportunities offer, sd/- E,C.Ross Lt.Col&amp; ITo. 259P.

In the first of these letters you state that on receijb of the telegram from this office dated 10th ultimo,you addressed a letter to the Chief of Bahrein warning hin that if he took any paibt in the complications on the mainland, Governme nt would not guarantee him protection. 3. With your letter To.1433/306 quoted above you forward the reply of the ChiQf to that communication,in which he states that his object' in sending help to Zobarah was to defend his o&amp;n island,not to encroach on his neighbours, and intimates his readiness to be guided by the policy of Governmeht. 4. It appears,however,from the Chief's conversation with Captain Fraser,as reported in your last mentioned letter,th that he clings to his right to Zobarah on the mainland, which he holds to be his as he occasionally resides there in summer,has some of his men there,and has repaired the fort. iZ'h r 5. Under these circumstances you solicit the further orde of the Government of India in the matter. 6. In the letter from the Government of India,No.2723P.d dated 10th December 1874,-^ou were informed that the Chief had no possessions on the mainland of Guttur,and that his rights there,were of a very uncertain character,that he should not be encouraged to despatch troops to the mainland for the reinforcements of his allies, that Government tould help him to repel attacks by sea,or to frustrate a threaten ing.mDvemenb irom the mainland,that if he adhered td) his s r t* 'treaty obligations the Croverrunent would protect hin,but he must not oe aggressor ot undertake measures which night in volve him in complications. 7.

After enquiries about your health,! beg to inform you (and may you hear naught but good) that during this long period I have always remembered you,although you are dis tant from us and there has been no correspondance between u usJbut friendship for you is deeply rooted in my heart and distance only increases and confirms it when love is rooted in hearts distance only increases it,especially the love of human beings'for their fellow creatures . I am confident that your sojourn in those parts,where you are,is benefi cial to us. Although I do not trouble you, I am certain that if any reports are received about me there,you will make up for my absence,and do better for me than if X were present. you Although I do not give' particulars,at present a mishap has befallen me,which has conpelled ne to inform, jcou about it, and I solicit God's aid,then yours,and I have good hopes in od and you,and God i/iJling through you and your generous aid I shall gain my object. To rat ]since the High Governmn ( Turkish ) took possession of the residents of Nejd,myself and my followers have been obedient to it,and have given our allegiance to it and have served it without any recom— pence. Tfhile other people are not so,they do not serve unle they are paid.In particular,as to my self,during all this time I have been Kaimmakam of the district of Katr,and have set aside all my own affairs,and have attended to the ser vice of the High Government,! have never asked for any sala r^ and have used my best endeavours in the service of the Government and for the benefit of the creed, As regards Oman you are well aware of its condi-conctl ion and. tlie incone which can be obtained fron i^b , and that this territory and its inhabitants are subject to the Government of Tejd. Ever since Governnent (Turkish) took possession of ITeJd,Oman has been left to itself,no one has taken notice of it,and each tovmship has remained in the hands of its inhabitants. It is not hidden from you tha Za'eed bin Khaleefa is one of the inhabitants of Oman, and he was the first man to pay taxes to you,the AlSuood, when the Government reduced the power of the Al-Suood,and paid no attention to Oman,the above Za'eed rose and began to follow his inclinations,and created dissensions amongst the © peoples,until he acquired power and became their their master,and seized all the revenues. He oppressed the people and tyranized ove them,while the people were power less and could not resist him,except by the aid of God and the High Turkish Government,and this after the justice and good treatment they experienced from the Al-Suood. But the Govt, neglected them,and left them out,as if they were not - subject to the Government of ITejd. 4. Then some of the inhabitants of the terms and villagesr came to me seeking my aid and soliciting that I shuld use my endeavours ^or them with the aiel Government,and arrange that they might be rid of the Jurisdiction of Za'eed khalee ^£2aL j .ah over them,and that the Government may include the terr. tories within the district and jurisdiction of ITejd,as of yore,so that the inhabitants may find peace and rest and be safe against murders and plunder,and be rid of this person, who fears not God,and knows not his wrath. I gave them good promises and full hopes,and I represented this matter to every Wali and LIutaserrif ,who came to these parts,and they used to girae me fair promises,and in turn I used to give similar promises to the inhabitants who used to become joy ful and hope for relief from God and the merciful Governmeh But months and years rolled fey away,and there was no re- ' suit,and the Government were quite neglectful, which we^e HegieettHi was not proper,as those epople were their sub- jects and included within the jurisdiction of the Govern- ment of ITejd. The revenues of Heja Oman equal those of© 1 ITejd,perhaps they are greater,especially if it cones in the hands of the high Govt, 5. 'When Za'eed bin Khaleefah cane to know about my coitn- sel and. eadeavours with the Officers of the Govt.,he har boured in his nind aninosity against ne,and instigated the tribes under his orders,who began to raid our neighbour hood,plunder our property,nurder our nen, outrage our wonen and nalie slaves of our free people,but since we are depend- dants of the high Govt.,I could not do anything,and prevent ed ny tribesnen from connitting any outages on hin (Zaed) or his tribesnen, and I hoped that the Governnent would re dress our wrongs and punish hin for his violent deeds. And whatever humiliation we have suffered at his hands,and whatever outrage he has done to us,I have conplained about the sane to the officials of the Governnent who have been in these parts,and they have given us fair pronises and fed us on strong hopes up to date,but no result has followed, 6. On this account when zaeed found no opposition fron tfe the Govt.,nor any rebuke,he Mid the Govt, in contenpt and thought that the high Govt, had no sense of honor and was render neglectful of her territories which she would not secure nor protect her subjects,he longed to seize Katr and its districts and include then in Onan, accordingly he prepared an arny under his son Khaleefah and brother-in-law,Mohaned bin ASaif,and despatched then to seize the town of Katr, while we and the inhabitants were in safety and protectmon of of God and the high Govt.,and we never thought that he would dare to this extent,nay even a great power would not have dared to actthus against a town under the protection of the flag of the high Govt.and we were all away fron the town of El-Katr, and ny son Ali and sone other inhabitants we^e only were in the town. They attacked then about the tine of norning prayer, on the 18th Raniadthan 1305 %- A.H. (oOth May 1888) and they were taken unaware. Th^ They set up an uproar,and whoever cane out of his house m in response to the call,was slain in front of the door of his house,and God so decreed that Ali ny son was anong thos who were slain,there were 50 other leading nen of the townslain and an equal number or perhaps mo re, wounded. The messenger brought this news to us after sometime. When they heard that our townspeople were about to receive reinforce ments they plundered what they could,and retreated. And I and my tribesmen arrived after the whole thing was over, (as decreed by God),and the enemy had departed.We wanted to pursue them,so that God might grant us revenge,but we feared to undertake anything previous to referring the matter to Govt,,which might not approve our proceedings. So we trusted in God and made no hurry,pending reference of the matter to the high Govt. Indeed this daring act of Zaeed is derogatory to the Govt,,because I am her servan and under her protection. Though before we came to place ourselves under the Govt.protection,he had power to act in this daring manner. So if the Govt, be moved by the sense of its honor,and guard its sublime position,against insult all well, if not let it shut its eyes against our acts,and give us permission to act against Zaeed,and the territories of Oman. And if I seize him then both I and he will he^h. og at the orders of God and the Govt, Lly sense of honor has been moved in view to secure and keep intact the respect and honor the high Govt, and do things which are benefi cial to its interests. Because securing the territory of Oman and including it within the jurisdiction of TTejd^as it was before,will add to the name and honor of the Govt,,and will prove beneficial to her treasury. But the Govt, is neglectfuli of this,and 1 do not know whether this neglect emanates from herself or that the high Cfev^TOfficials do not report these matters to the Govt,,in a correct manner May you for ever continue to be the ornament, enjoying high position and honors,and everlasting relic of the re nowned families of Arabs, your 7, I consider and my condition as the same, anything add ing to my honor,! believe,will give you pleasure in the same way that increase 01 your honor,gives me pleasure, 8, An^ loso,io a loo., to all oi us, with full hopes in ys you, I have been induced to communicate the matter to you1 I and give all these details, I know that,thanks to God,your advice is accepted by the Govt. I hope therfore you will represent the matter to the Sultan,and by the favor of God I liope,o£iur object will be gained. 9. Tlietfe must be one of two things,i.e.,that the Govt, will undertake the task of seizing Oman,and we shall give our aid in the matter in every way. Or we solicit that the Govt.ma^ permit us to seize the territory and secure it By the grace and aid of God and the high Govt.,I hope to subdue the territories and release the inhabitants from their miserable position,and they will pray for the pros perity of the Sublime Govt. After this if the Govt.should desire that I should hold charge for it, paying the re venues to the Govt.,or that they wish to take charge of it themselves,they will be free to choose. 10.

Unaided and unsupported it is not in the power of Jasi to undertake the conquest of any districts of Oman. Desul tory raids are the utmost in his power,and the Beni Yass tribesmen are more than a match for ^asim's following. He, however,followed up his appeal to the Turkish Govt.by a similar appeal to w Ibn Kashid*' whose power is now paromount in Central i ejd as well as in the ITorth Western Provinces of Araoia,and apparently it is only some unforseen ciroums— tances that have delayed a movement from ITejd on Oman. 4. It be assumed as certain that the Turkish Authorii ties and Lrovt.have been lully informed of these matters,and it seems more clear than ever that it depends on the atti tude of the Porte whether or not any serious invasion of 0 Oman is undertaken. It is very probable that •♦Ibn Eashid* is (as reported)awaiting a reply ^rom the Porte beforei . mmnoving. Anyhow a respite,at least,has been accorded,and I would venture to suggest that advantage should be taken of the delay,to consider our relations with the Turks 8c Arabs on the Katr Coast, in view pf possible,to some understanding with the Turkish Govt.,which would put a stop to the danger ous border warfare now going on and prevent the possibility of any extensive aggression on the Oman provinces. A friend ly feeling between the Turks and ourselves in the Persian Gulf would I think be mutually advantegeous 8c might perhaps be obtained by a spontaneous recognition under certain con ditions of their ''de facto 1 *position on the Katr Coast eaable which would also make the British Government to hold the Po Porte more fully responsible for any attempted encroachment on the Oman territories. i ♦ i l ) sd/ E.C.Itoss Col.

Desul tory raids are the utmost in his power, and the Beni Yass tribesmen are more than a match for Jasim 1 s following. He, however,followed up his appeal to the Turkish Govt.by a similar appeal to^Ibn Rashid*' whose power is now paramount in Central ITeJd as well as in the ITorth Western Provinces of Arabia, and apparently it is only some unforseen cireums- tances that have delayed a movement from Nerjd on Oman, r. It may be assumed as certain that the Turkish Authori* ties and Govt.have oeen fully informed of these matters,and it seems more clear than ever that it depends on the atti tude oi' the Porte whether or not anc serious invasion of 0 Oman is undertaken. It is very probable that ♦ 'Ibn Rashid 1 is (as reported) awaiting a reply from the Porte before no clooving. Anyhow a respioe^au least;,has been accorded^and I would venture to suggest that advantage ahould be taken of the delay,to consider our relations with the Turks &amp; Arabs on the Katr Coast, in view jbf possible,to some understanding frith the Turkish Govt#,which v ;ould. put a stop to the danger ous border warfare now going on and prevent -the possibility of any extensive aggression on the Oman provinces® A friend ly feeling between the Turks and ourselves in the Persian Gulf would I think be nutually advantegeous &amp; might perhaps be obtained by a spontaneous recognition under certain con- ditions of their 11 de facto* •position on the Katr Coast exia'v ^ ^ which would also the British Government to hold the Porte more ftilly responsible for any attempted encroachment on the Oman territories. sd/ ID,0 # Ross Col. Political Resident,p0rsian Gulf,y Ho. 5 of 1895 On boB.rcl H, M. S. 'Hugh Rose' Llarch 8th 1895 To Colonel E. C. Ross Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Sir, I have the honour to report that I arrived at Bahrein in H. M. S. 'Briton' on the 24th February. As Capt ain Bime had received orders by telegran to repair with his vessel to Aden, I took up my residence at Lienanah and sent T. r ord to tlie Chief by messenger, as he was out on a shooting excursion, to inform him of my arrival. He returndthe next day and called upon me. I handed him the letter to be deli vered to him(copy enclosed) which he read carefully and stated he understood its contents. He requested time to think over the matters that had been communited to him and J I managed to visit him at LIuharrak on Saturday the 27th x eoruary. uring uhis first interview I took the opportu nity oi telling him that he had now received the final deci sion of the Hovernment of India,that the point of his right oi interference in a.ifairs on the mainland could not well oe rex erred again,and that it behoved him carefully to con sider his present position and the modifications it might occasion. -he 1 'Briton•'sailed on the 24th leaving the * 1 1 'Uagpie*'to guard the Island until relieved by the Minble which vessel was expected on the 2nd March. ^ I On the 26th I received information that some of the uaeem tribe residing at Zobarah and its vicinity had made overtures to Mahomed bin.Thani of Bidaa on the G-uttur coast and were desirous of transferring their allegiance to ncbn.rpovided sufficiently favourable terms could be secured also that Jasim bin Thani,who avows himself a Turkish sub- ject,had written to the heads of the ITaeem tribe and offer ed them the choice of war to the death,removal to Bahrein, or subjection to his authority,and that at about the time ^ :AMulahnan bin Feysal Quitted the island of Bahrein to embark on his illfated enterprise in the province of Lahsa the Chief Sheikh Lanau had written letters to influential people in Lahsa At ny interview with the Chief on the 27th Febr. I asked hin if he wished to na]:e an^' remarks regarding the letter that had been given to him at our last meeting. He replied he desired to defer doing so till he gained time for reflection and that he wished to consult his brother Ahmed without whose advice he apparently does not do any thing. To this I made no objection. I then told him, as directed, of the reports in circulation that j asir Pasha had obtained possession of certain letters of a compromising character written by the Chief to influential p persons in Lahsa. He answered H I have friends in Lahsa to whom I occasionally write. never however write to them but on pri vate suojects or to execute small commissions for me. Hot one s^, liable that could get me into trouble have I ever penned, 'The Cniei told me he was not aware of any of the ITaiem tribe having made proposals to the Chief of Outlier of transfer of allegiance and thau he had not heard 01 the letter reported to have been written to the heads of the Taiem tribe by Jasim bin Thanee thre atening them with expulsion from their territory unless they vo luntarily vacated Zobareh or acknowledged his authority. On uhe 2nd March the ''Llinble'•anchored in the Harbour and the Lagpie*' proceeded to Bushire to coal about two hours after her arrival. Previous to quitting Bahrein the Chief again visited me and I told him I had received two letters under fl^infe seals to the address of the Resident(forwarded herewith). I then wen on to say that at first interview the final decision of the Government of India after consideration of the whole case had oeen submitted to him,that he must understand from the explicit instructions of Government that the consequence of his inter- fernce in the affairs oi the mainland beyond his insular posses sions,the exercise of rights of sovereignty there that might lead to complications,or in'fact of any conduct that did not meet with the approval of Government,would be the withdrawal of the promises pi protection held out to him,and that the argu ments employed in his present letters were of a precisely simi-7^ ; , (y. sar.ular nature to those adopted ih a previous connunioation on ranch the Oovernnent had connunicated its views and the polic i : 1 - intended to naintain. To he replied that he had j frequently been warned in general terns to abstain from interference on the r.iainland,that he had carried out the wishes of Government in this respect,but that he had never been expressly forbidden to throw up connectina rath Zobaral .'ishcd Lhe two letters {enclosed)to be fonTarded to tfel, the 'esmdent for consideratiinn. Feeling unable to explain .-ore clearly than I had already done and not being empower ed to discuss natters in extenso,! confined myself for the rest 01 the interview to conversation on general topics. ft Just before leaving the Chief mentioned incidentally ha had heard of ^asim's threats against the ITaeem tribe. ^ ^ :ie '--^rch a letter was received by Shei 1 ih Fanad,an -jncle of the Chief,from Abdulla bin Zaraa one of the leading men in Lahsa in which it was reported that Saood bin Peysal died at Riadh in the month of Ramzan and that 'ilawee (an uncle of the deceased and brother to Peysal)had temporarily been placed at the had of affairs in J the 'eJdean Kingdom. Saood's family it was said had remove' irom Riadh fearing the animosity of his bigoted brother Abdulla who is at present believed to be in the vicinity of lieoca. his letter is dated 23rd February. The truth of this news is open to doubt for the death is reported to have tahen p^ace nearly three months back and no confir- matory mteligence had been received in Bahrein to date of [f Tny leaving. S. Batee bin Khadim the Chief of Odeyd about two years ago obtained a Turkish flag from Alee Effendi the Turkish Agent id Bidaa and whenever Turkish subjects visit his port,and occasionally at other times,this flag is flown When however he apprehends a hostile movement from the Arab Chiefs oi the littoral he hoists an English fiag- ^nsign which his father obtained from Col. Felly the then Resident in the Gulf. Odeyd pays 500 krans yearly to Jasim bin Thanee of Bidaa for the privilege of the pearl fishery on its shores. There are no Turks there.Up to date Mahomed, bin Thanee has taken no steps to recover the noney due to the banyans of Bahrein for the losses sustained by them last year during the piratical raid of the Beni Hajar. Some 600 warriors of this tribe are said 'to be now ^jidaa as also 500 Ox bhe Manaseer and 50 of the A1 Morrah on the look out for an opportunity of plundering the cattle and ^ locks of the Huttur tribes with whom they are at enmity. They are subsisted in some degree by Mahomed bih Thanee. Confirmatoy reports have reached me of some of the TTaeem having proceeded to i:)idaa and proposed alliance. They were informed their prd)- ^-posals would be accepted on condition of thfcir vacating Zobarah md oecoming commorant at Bidaa. These terms not proving accep a,ble they returned to their home on the western coast of the ubtur peninsula. during m^ 7 ' stay I could not but observe the large num— •er Ox strangers that floch to Bahrein and especially people of hsa who crowded the bazaars and were to be seen everywhere. I was told they were nearly all fugitives from Lahsa and that •ost 01 them were in a miserable state of destitution. The Chie - heard very liberally contributes to relieve their ditress but for annot support them long as they probably number some two thou sand souls. I left Bahrein in H.M.S. 1 'Hugh'^ose* * on the 8th Marc I have etc. sd/- E.A.Praser Lt Actg 2nd Asst Resident, Per si ah r, • Gulf.%</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fc_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/29</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fc</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/29</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File No: E.6.
