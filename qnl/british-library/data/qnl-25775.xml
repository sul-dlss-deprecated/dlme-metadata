This phrase I take it is in the sense held to mean anyone who is better employed where he is ordinarily employed, rather than its meaning ? “great importanct , •. The employment of 'Infantry Captain* is less important than that of political Agent, or similar work, in Arabia, in case of war, so perhaps you would wish to have me placed on the list which the Government of Indie send of *officers employed in key positions*.

Letters between De Gaury; Roland Tennyson Peel (Secretary for the Political Department in the India Office), the Government of India External Affairs Department, and Trenchard Craven Fowle (Political Resident in the Persian Gulf), aim to ensure that De Gaury is not requested to serve in the military as he is holding a 'key appointment' within the India Office. Herbert James Greedy in the War Office issues a letter in September 1939 (folio 2) to confirm that De Gaury will not be enlisted.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Military service</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002ae#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
