Criminal Case No.10/1947: Complainant: Passport Officer, Bahrain. PT ^ / / Charge: Abetment of entering Bahrain without passport, under Article 3 of King*s Regulation No.2 of 1937. J U 0 G E N X: The prosecution story is that on the 13th April, 1947, at about 10 A.k., while on sea patrol duty, Lance Naik Abdul Rahman bin Marzooq intercepted the craft of the accused, Nakhuda Ali bin ISansoor, which had on her board 12 passengers - 5 Baluchis and 7 Persians - who were not in possession of « passports. The boat was first seen near the Sitrah Anchorage moving towards Bitrah. There are 4 P.Ws. P.tf. No.1 L/N. Abdur Rahman bin Marzooq states that when he saw the boat first near the Bitrah Anchoragi he took the craft for a fishing boat as he saw some baskets hanging from it but afterwards when he saw the unusual number of men on it he asked the Nakhuda where he was going. The Nakhuda said that he was bound for Dammam. But when he asked the passengers they replied that their object was to find some work in Bahrain. P.W. 2 Abdul Aziz bin Ali, one of the passengers deposes that he paid fc.12/- to the Nakhuda as freight from v^atar to Dammam where he has his father. P.Ws. Nos. 3 and 4, Sayid Ali bin Bayed Ahmad and Ba*ad bin Khamis respectively, who are policemen, depose that the boat was found near the Sitrah Anchorage moving towards Sitrah and that the Nakhuda said that he was bound for Dammam and the crew said that their destination was Bahrain. The accused admits that he brought 12 passengers (l) Kalandar bin Abdullah, (2) Ibrahim bin Dal Bhah, (3) Muhammad bin Sulaiman, (4) Hasan bin Najjar, (5) ohahdad bin Sulaiman, (6) Saleh bin Muhammad Bastaki, (7) Abdul Latif Abdur Rahman, (8) A(8) All bin Muhaffiiaud, (9) Ahnwd bin Abdullah, (10) Ghulam bin Abdullah Dastaki, (11) Muhammad iioor bin Abdullah and (l^j) Abdul Aziz bin Ali Bastaki on his craft from ^atar. He also admits that none of them had any passrorts. He pleads that he w was carrying the passengers to Dammam and that his boat was intercepted by the Police in the sea far away from bitrah. He adds that some one at Dammam stood surety for the passengers and hence he carried them without passports being in their possession. From the evidence adduced by the i ..&lt;s. except to.2 who is one or the passengers and who will naturally be inclined to belittle the offence of the Hakhuda, I have reason to believe that the boat was intercepted near the ditrah Anchorage when * r she was sailing towards ^itrah. Had the accused the intention of going to Dammam he would have taken the usual different route. He has failed to give the name of the alleged surety at Dammam or to j reduce any proof in supi ort of his } lea. Under the circumstances, the accused is found guilty under Article 3 of King’s Regulation Ro. 2 of 1937 and sentenced to 2 months* rigorous imprisonment and also to pay a fine of ..dCC/-, ,ud in default of payment of the fine his boat should be sold as provided under Article 4 of the above mentioned Regulation. The question of removal of the accused from Bahrain is referred to the District Court under Article 2 of the aforesaid Regulation. Announced. Dated, 27.4.47. Sd.

The three accused - Abdulla bin Hasan, Ali bin Hasan and Fataah bint Aodulla - were arrested by Natur Mubarak bin Mohammed on 5th June 1942 walking in Galali, a'coastal village in Muharraq island. The following day they were produced before the passport Officer to tne Bahrain Government and admitted that they had come from Qatar without a pass. That is why the prosecution did not produce any evidence. 2. Accused No.l Abdulla bin Hasan states that he came with a pass and produces a diver’s book saying that he had bis pass in it but lost it. Later on he produced an Exit pass issued by the Bahrain Government in 1357 A.H. (1938) for outward journey. Accused No.2 Ali bin Hasan admits to have co^e without a paos out pleads that he has a diver’s book. Accused No.3 Fatima bint Abdulla, the daughter of Accused No.l Abdulla bin Hasan, denies to have come without a pass and pleads that she obtained a pass and gave it to a woman who was left hehind in Iran along with the pass. 3. Neither accused No.l Abdulla bin Hasan’s Exit permit nor Ali bin Hasan’s diver’s book ia a valid travel document. Nor can accused No.3 Fatmah bint Abdulla’s plea that she gave her pass to a woman who was left behind in Iran be accepted by the Court. All the accused are therefore guilty of the offence of entering Bahrain without a pass under Article 1 and 2 of King’s Regulation No.2 of iS 1937 and I sentence accused No.l Abdulla bin Hasan and accused No.2 Ali bin Hasan each to three months’ rigorous imprisonment under Article 2 of the said Regulation.

The sentence v^as passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Bahrain, in 1926 under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Coda as applied to'Bahrain under Section 14 of the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913. l/3rd remission is orainarily granted to all convicts who volunteer to serve their sentences in the And ama n Islands and is equivalent to the remission which prisoners earn under the remission system in force in jails in India. The prisoner had already eamdd a remission of 4 months and 23 days while in jail in India, and if the remission referred to above were sanctioned, he would have been due for release on the 25th November 1940. 2. The Persian Gulf authorities, who were consulted stated that if remission were granted Muhammad should in no circumstances be allowed to return to Bahrain. After careful consideration of the case the Governor General in Council has been pleased to sanction release of Mohammad, under section 403- of the Criminal Procedure read with Section 14 of 'the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913, and instructions are being issued to the passport issuing authorities not to grant him passport facilities for Bahrain.

Ismail bin Abdur Rahman,has been charged with the offence of entering Bahrain without passport. The facts of the case are that in the evening of 29th September 1940 at about 8 p.m. the accused acc ompanied by 7 other men who arrived at Bahrain in a sailing vessel from Qater landed at G-alali, one of the villages of Kuharraq. They were seen by two fishermen (P. ,7s 2 &amp; 3) who by chance had gone to the sea to have a look at their fish traps, and chased them thinking that they were tnieves. The accused was caught by the fishermen and handed over to Natur Bashir(P. 7.1) who sent him to the Passport Office , but the other seven persons escaped. The accused admitted that he had no pass when he landed and stated that his object in landing was to purchase bread for the other passengers on' board the sailing boat. The accused's statement may have been accex^ted had he been alone, when he landed, and not accompanied by a gang who were fTightened and ran away from the two fishermen leaving their friend (accused) behind. I therefore hold the accused guilting of entering Bahrain without pass under sections 1 and 2 of King's Regulation No. 2 of 1937 and sentence him to 3 months' rigorous imprisonment. 2.

OFFENCE Entering Bahrain without a (King T s Regulation No.2 of JUDGEMENT. Accused Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad Irani has been charged for entering Bahrain recently without a passport, ne admits that he has no passport but pleads that it was brought by his wife, who is staying in Bahrain, about five years ago. Presumably he refers to the travel permit issued by the Bahrain Government to Iranis. But since the intro duction of the King 1 s Regulation No.2 of 1937 these passes are not valid and accused's entry into Bahrain on the authority of a pass of that nature if any, issued five years ago cannot be regarded legal. He has evidently infringed the said King's Regulation and I hold him guilty under sections 1 and 2 thereof. But as he is sixty three years of age and too old to undergo imprisonment, I am of opinion that the ends of justice will be sufficiently met if he is simply removed from Bahrain without being sent to prison.

The prosecution depends onthe evidence of the three above mentioned witnesses for their case. Their depositions are more or less the same; r nd as nome of the points of fact mentioned by prosecution are denied by the accused- they all admit having 1 nded near Bu Ghazal without passes but only plead not guilty for various reasons - an exhaustive examination of prosecution evidence is nox. necessary. 3.

Offence: gTnrrirt Criminal intimidation Section: 506 I.P.C. m OziSL- The brief story of the case is that on 13th Bamadhan 1357 a t 5 A.M. accused Nos. 1 and 2 together with a number of Bahrain subjects stood on the main Awali Hoad near Sooqul Wmim* Khamis and stopped a number of omnibuses carrying workers to Awali Oil Fields saying that there was no work in the Oil Company that day and intimidating the drivers to Itx go back. One of those buses was driven by Abdullah Mu^j. $hen his bus arrived Sooqul Khamis accused Nos. 1 and 2 stood in front of the busand accused No. 1 asked the driver to go back to Manamah as there was no woik in Awali that day and told him that if he did not go back the accused would tear his tyres with the knife he had M in his hand. The driver went back in order to inform the police but when he reached Hauta Abul he jtf saw Yusuf Taha, the driver of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. Yusuf Taha, on seeing this and afow other buses standing still on the road, stopped his carafnd enquired from the driver what the matter was. He teatid told him that the buses were 1 nstaua returned from Sooqul Khamis by certain persons who were standing on thexxuasi road and telling all the drivers to go back as there was no work in Awali. Driver Yusmf Taha went to Sooqul Khamis and when his car reached there a caused Nos. 1 and 2 threw themselves before the car and he was forced ton stop as accused Nos. 1 snd 2 told him to go back. Yusuf Taha went straight to Police Station and when could not find any senior Police/Police officials there he rushed to the palace, took a hand ful of Fidawis, went ^ to Sooqul Khamis and with the help of the Fidawis arrested accused Nos. ^ 1 and 2 and his colleagues and took them to Police Station. 2* Six prosecution witnesses were produced.?.W* No. 1 Khair Muhanmad son of Khushhal, an employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, states that on 12th Ramadhan ^hile he was s^lttii^; in the Arab club in Awali the news was brought that 2 Arabs were arrested by the (government/ of Manamah. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 who were among those present got up and said that as they were Muslims they would have courage andjstop the buses from going to Awali / the follcmng day. P.W. No. 1 did not want to / join them as he w r as an/ Indian but they told him that if he joined them his pay in Awali would be increased and the people on the road would be over-awed if hey saw many people. P.W.No. 1 agreed. A little before sunrise they came in Company’s lorry to Sooqil Khamis. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 stopped 2 buses from going to Awali saying that there was no work there that day. Then P.W. No. 1 went to call of nature. On his return he found the white car of Shaikh Abdullah. The driver of the car stopped, went back to Manamah, brought Fadawis with him, arrested accused Nos. 1 and 2 and a few others and took them to Polite Station. 3. P.W.No.2 Yusuf Taha, the driver of Shaikh Abdullah* s car, happened jdc to go to Pa fa that morning soon after prayers and when he arrived Hauta Abul he saw a number of buses standing on the road. On enquiry he came to know that all these buses were returned from Sooqul Khamis by a handful of men who were standing on the road aid preventing buses from goin^to Awali. Yusuf Taha went to Sooqul Khamis. When he reached there he saw accused No. 1 ( Muhammad bin) Kamal and 4 other/ persons standing rig)it in the middle of the road and ; raising their hands to stop the car. They did not say anythin; to P.W. But even when they saw his car coming/coming close they did net move and had he not put on his brakes quickly they would have been overrun. When he saw all this he Mix went back to M&amp;naxnah* When he ssix could not^get help from fffe Police Station owing to the fact that there was no official there anrgfrw authorised to send out policemen he went to the Palace, took a number ol Shaikh’s Fidwis with him/ andasked the drivers of buses standing near Hauta Abul to follow him to Sooqul Khamis 0 On arrival in Sooqul Khamis the Fidawis arrested the obstructors and took them to Police Station. He himsell went on his way to Hafa and the buses f ollowed him. He recognised only accused No. 1 and 2 and tneir colleague thesonf of Adam, a Bahrain subject. He d oew not recognise others as all of them had their faces wrapped with Ghatras. 4. P.W.No. 3 Natoor Ali bin Salman who was in one of the buses stopped bycaccused Nos. 1 and 2 and their colleagues states that he saw more than 10 persons standing in the middle of the road near Sooqul Khamis when his bus arrived there and that accused No. 1 had a small knife in his hand, got in the bus and told the driver to go back vdth the passengers or to go to Awali alone and leave the passengers in Sooqul Khamis, putting him in fear of tearing his tyrey if he did not follow his instruc tions. As for accused No. 2 he was shouting with others; ’Go back. No vrork in Jabal today. Go back 11 . P.W.No.4 Kamehan bin Ziban who left Sakhir after morning prayers in order to meet his caster Shaikh Salman bin H.H. Shaikh Hamad on board the ship met # P.W.No. 2 in jooqul Khamis and P.W. No.2 asked him to take accused Nos.land 2 and thraf* other oersons in his car to Police Station. As accused No-i entered the car P.W.No. 4 asked him why he ms obstructing the public road and whether he was the Government as it is only the Government who can B&amp;ttBflBfc prevent people from using a road; and accused T 'o. 1 replied ' I am Hitler - . P.W.No. 5 Abdulla^ bin Ma’arij, the /-4 the driver of one ofthe buses stopped by accused Nos.l and 2 and their colleagues, heard people shouting stopj stopl Baunid ! Baunid l^but he could not recognise who they were as it was quite dark* He a Iso admits that P.Wo No. 3 Natoor Ali bin Sal^jnan was in his car but he did not see any knife in accused No. I’s hands nor did he see accused No* 1 enterii^ his bus and talking to him. P*W* the cleaner No. 6 Ghulam bin TSaspsii Baqir, XKMUisaoaffl/in P.W. NOoXiat 5*s bus, also heard people shouting 'stopl stopl'* but could not recognise any of them. None of the P#Ws. supported P.W. No.XjX S's contention that accused No. 1 had a knife in his hand* 5* 'This is the total sum of prosecution evidence 0 As for the defence accused Nos* 1 and 2 totally deny any participation in preventing the buses from going to Awalio Accused No* 1 says that on Saturday the 12th Bmaoha Ramadhan he wag^not in the Arab Club, Awali, as he is not a member; norths persuade P.W.No.l Khair Muhammad to join the Kovement and stop buses from going to Jl Awali. He left Awali on Datofx Saturday at 4 P*M. English in the bus of Khalil Kanoo and gave a chit to the driver P.W* No. 5 in lieu of hp buying a ticket. He was sitting in the cafe owned jointly by Mashaallah and Mirza Khalil in Muharraq till 7 P.M. Arabic (12-15A.M. English) and from there went home straight and slept. He left Muharraq pier next day early in the morning in order to go to work in Awali - he is a gauger- perhaps in the jolly- boat of Isa al Paycs; but he is not sure in whose boat he went as there were a number/ of jollyboats there and he did not remember which / jollyboat he took. He got down at Manamah pier and there he got in a 10 passengers station wagon in order to go to Awali. !ria: When the bus reached Sooqul Araba (Manamah) some of the passengers got down andaome new ones got in. Among the latter there was also accused No. 2. Iflhen the bus reached Sooqul Khamis accused No. 1 saw Khalil Kanoo f s big bus and another small bus/bus standirg and he heard people shouting ^ stop! go backl' Accused No. 1, accused No* 2 and a certain Ahmad bin Adam, a Bahrain subject raho travelled with accused Nos.l and 2 in the same bus, got iojui down intendirjg to catch any bus going to Awali and to go to workj Accused No. 1 rantd said to accused No. 2 and Ahmad bin Adam that as he was an Irani and a foreigner he had nothing to do with this national movement. As they stood waiting for a bus to carry them to Awali they saw a ]s rge crowd of Bahamas standing and shouting that there was no work in Awali that day. No car passed that way while they were standing there except the white car of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. 15 Bedouins came out of it, arrested accused Nos. 1 and 2 and Ahmad bin Adam and took them to Police Station. As for F.W.No.l Khair Muhammad, accused No. 1 saw him standing in S ooqul Khamis on his arrival from Manamah and does not know afanre whether P.W.No.l had come from Manamah orI**±±x Awali. He was standing amorf Bahamas. Accused No.l also states that he did not deliver a lecture in the Arab Club in Awali as no lecture can be delivered unless it has been approved by the President and a copy /zf kept for record. Moreover, when he was under arrest he saw Hamad bin Hash id al Mulla and Malallah bin Saleh whoa, sked him why he was under arrest and her eplied that he was accused of pre venting people from going to Awali. Upon this they replied that Shaikh Tbakr Daej bin Hamad had returned the cars from the main *?]*** gate of Awali between 6 and 8 A*M* aid that Shaikh Dacj wa sire sponsible for it. 6 . It will be seen from accused No.l’s statement that his main defence is that he was in Muharra^ on the night before the buses were stopped from going to Awali; and he had 5 D.W*s summoned for that purpose. Out of them one was out of Bahrain and could not be served. Among the rest D.W. No. 1 Mirza Khalil bin Husain, the keeper of a cafe in Muharraq, says that throughout Ramadhan he did not see accused No. 1 in Muharraq except one night but he does not remember what date it was. Nor is D.W* No.2 Muhammad No or .pin Muhammad, a soda water maker in Muharraq,/- 6 - Muharraq, sure whetiier accused No. 1 came to Muharraq on the ni^it of 12th Bamadhan. But D.W. No. 3 Hajji bin Ahmad Bu Shelebi says that ^lile he was s ittirg in the ship of D.W.No.2 on Saturday at 3 P.M. Arabic (8 15 P.M. English) accused No. 1 came there and had^-lemomde. He also says that a certain Abbas of Hidd was also with the accused. D.W.No.4 Abdur Bahman bin Jasin al Muawada who was sitting in D.W. No. I’s cafe on Saturday the 12th ^imadhan also saw accused No. 1. sitting there till 6 P.L. Arabic (11.15. P.M. English). Accused No. 1 has there fore been successful in proving that between 3 and 6 P.M. Arabic (8.15 and 11.15 P.M. English) he was in Muharraq. But he has not been able to prove conclusively (a) that he was not in the Arab Club in gMhll&amp;XjE awali on Satur day at 6 P.M.; and (b) that he left Muharraq just in time to be able to reach awali to work and not earlier in order to prevent the bua^e from going to Awali. Regarding (a) there was only one evidence i.e. of P.W.^No.l and therefore the Court had Amin bin Ghulam Abbajl driver summonded as a court witness No. 2 as he was mentioned by P.W. No. 1 to be present in the Dlub when the news of the arrest of 2 Arabs was brought and accused No^l^ and 2 started to agitate people but totally denize his presence.in the /v ^ slee Arab Club at that time and states that he was a in his Barasti. As no other names were given by P.W. 1 who did not know all the people present it was not possible for the Court to accertain that point. But let us give accused No. 1 the benefit of doubt and let us asume that he was not present at that time in the Club. But can r t he remember any of the passengers who travelled with him from Awali to Manamah in Khalil Kanoo 1 s bus at 4 P.M. P.W. No 5. the driver of the bus and P.S. No. 6 the cleaner of the bus may be justified in not remembering whether the accused gave them a chit in lieu of buying a ticket or no^as there were lot of passengers in the bus but a passanger can always remember one or two of his co-passengers when he has been wi th them for nearly half an hour in the bus. The pame remarks apply to (b) Accused No* 1 is not sure of the boatman who brought him from Muharraq to !■ anamah and doubtfully mentions the nameof Isa al l^tyez who when called by the court as court witness No. 1. stated that he did not remember whehter accused No. 1. travelled in his boat on that day or not although he was sure that accused very often comes in his boat. Nor does accused Ho. 1. know or remember the t names of any of his co-passengers from Muharraq to Sooqual Khamis with the exception of accused No. 2. $ whom he state^ to have entered his bus in Sooqularba. The name of the driver of the 10 passengers bus or the him names of any of its passengers are not knownto^either inspite of the fact that he been in Bahrain for 17 years and admits that fact himself. Nor can he tell any names of the persons who saw him entering the jolly-boat in Muharraq and getting out of it in Manamah. The only name he mentions among his co-passangers is tist of accused No. 2. but that is contradicted by accused No. 2 who stated that when he reached Sooqul Khamis he found accused No. 1. P.W. No. !t and Ahmed bin Adam standing there f This shows that accused No. 1 did not travel in the same bus with accused No. 2. Thus taking all these facts into consideration, I am not prepared to believe accused No. I’s story that when he reached Sooqul Xhamis he rc saw P.W. N0.5 f s large bus and another bus and that he did not see any other bus or stop any buses. Granting that he was in Muharraq till 6 .P.M. Arabic (11.15 P.M. English) or even later, there is noting to prove that he did not slip away after that to Manamah and thence to Sooqul Khamis in order to prevent the buses from going to Awali as there is a day and night continuous boat service between Muharraq and Maharaah. On the contrary, P.Ws. Nos 2 and 3 and Court witness No. 3 Abdul Hamid bin Abdul Aziz driver definitely recognised front of their 1 car^ # • • • •- 8 - cars asking them to go back to Mahamah, Again, on the night before the trouble took place, as stated by NO. 3 and admitted by accused No 1. himself, accused No. 1 was found in the company of a certain ■ Abban of Hidd, an office boy in Awali who was clearly identified by P.W. No.g to be present in Sooqul Khamip. and shouting to people to go back to Maj&amp;amah and who is under arrest waiting his trial by the Bahrain Court and that is another pro sumption against accused’s parti cipation in the movement. His pleas that he ia an Irani and a foreigner and has no interest in the Bahrain National movement does not hold water. His excuse that the buses were returned from the main gate by Shaikh Dsaj Bin Sheikh Hamad and that Sheikh Daej was responsible for cassation of work in Awali is not rple- vant because accused No. 1. ijji charged for preventing the buses from g^ang to Awali at Sooqul Khami# at about sunrise and the fact thatjbhe buses were returned after that by Sheikh Daej or somebody elsp does not in ^ help him^any way. 7-. As far accused No. 2, he pleads complete o innocence. He states that he was not present in the Club on Saturday evening but was sitting with Ahmad bin Adam in latter’s Baraoti in Awali till 11 P.M. s*i- m after which he came to Mahamah, and- in Muhammad Jfciran’s cafe near cinema till 1 R.M., went to Yusuf Kanoo’s house and slept there as usual with other servants of Yusuf Kanoo’s. AC5-30 A.M. he took a bus for Awali but when he reached Sooqul Khamis he saw a large crowatof Bahranas and a few Arabs standing and shouting: 'Stop” GrO back. There is no work in Jabal today” He does not recognise who were shouting. When he got down he saw accused No. 1. P.W. NO. 1 and Ahmad bin Adam standing there. He asked them what the matter was and they told him that the Bahranas and certain-9- certain Arabs had stopped the buses from going to Awali saying that there was no work in Awali and they were waiting for a bus to cane and carryjbhem to work oj in Awali, He went for call^ nature and on his return was told that Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa f s white car came and went back to Mahamah. After 10 minutes the r nmre returned white car dMaiGCSl/J £ with a number of Bpdonins, The Baharanas and other Arabs ran away. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 ,P.W. No# 1# and Ahmad bin Adam and a certain Mubarak remained# They were arrented by the Bedouins and taken to Police Station. But he cannot tell the names of the drivers in whoae buses he travelled from Awali to Manamah in the night and back in the morning. Nor does he remembered- the names of any of his co-passengers# His excuse for not being able to recognise the driver of the bus which took him to Sooqul Khamis is tnat passangers take their seats in the bus without having anything to do with the driver whom they see only when they get down to pay and because he did not get a chance to pay the driver owing to his getting down in Sooqul Khamis he could not see the driver# But he mentions no excuse for his failure to know the driver who took him previous day to Manamah or the passangers who were with him in the bus on both the journeys# He also states that because he is an Irani a foreigner and the national movement is against foreigners it is not possible that he should be against the Government or the Company who gave himSffiQLwokk. Such are the excuses out forward by accused NO. 2# But P.Ws Nos# 2 and 3 recognised him when he stopped their reapective buses in Sooqul Khamis and P.W. NO. 1 also supports P.Ws. Nos. 2 and S’s depositions. In face of this evideI am forced to find him guilty, 8 . As for the offence of which accused NoSo 1 and2 should be convicted, the Police charged them for criminal intimidation with intent to cause injury to the property of a person rejying as they did on the evidence by P.W.NO. 3 Matoor Ali bin Salman who stated that accused No*, 1 had a pen knife in his hand and threatened ?.!• No 5 to tear his tyres if he went to Awali* The charge was also framed for that offence under section 506 none of the other P.Ws. supported P.W. NoS’s alle- ;ation regarding I.P.C. But aa on cross eiiamination by accused No. l^and the threat of tearing P.W. No. 5's tyres I do not feel justi- a^knife 3 by S accused ^ ied in convictin S accused Nos. 1 and 2 of criminal No. 1. intiraidatiorjand hol^t them guilty of three other offences namely, (1) Using criminal force under section 552; (2) Wrongful restraint under section 341; and (3) being a member of unlawful assembly with a common object of compelling people, by means of criminal force or show of criminal force, to adngrt to do what they are legally bound to do i.e. with the common object of preventing motor drivers from carrying workers to Awali Oil Fields under section 143. I therefore order that aeeused Nos. 1 and 2 should each undergo six month’s rigorous imprisonment.

' Crovm Versus Abdullah bin Hussain Irani, Section: King’s Regulation No. 2 of 1937. (Infringement of passport regulation). O rde r. The Bahrainboveraraent complain that accused Abdullah bin Hussain Irani came from Bushire on the 4th December, 1938 in a sailing boat but, instead of going back with the boat on the 29th December, 1938, as he had no pass, he stayed in Bahrain and was c;aught loitering at the Customs pier on 3rd January, 1939, P. W.No. 1 Abdullah bin Ahmad, Natur in the Passport Department, is the only prosecution witness and it was not xjBRlxxiixaL considered necessary to call for more witnesses because the accused himself aamits that he stayed behind send did/I not go with the Nakhuda with whom he had come as a sailor from Bushire. His only excuse is that he had a quarrel with the Nakhuda who happens to be his brother and did not want to go with him. He also plaads that his brother was going to CU^cC oU ck (aJCUaJ -i&lt;&gt; Xxkx&amp;itt Basrah^as he is due in Bushire for conscription. But neither lx his bxaikxx quarrel with his brother nor his obligation to g o to Bushire for conscription exempt him from the liabilities imposed by section 1 and 2 of the King’s Regulation No. 2 of 1937. The main point is that he landed in Bahrain as a s ailor without a passport- as/as sailors are exempt from travel papers- and instead of ?oing back^ as a sailor he remained in Bahrain# In other words, he entered Bahrain without a passport and has committed an offence under Section 1 of King’s Regulation Xxx No. 2 of 1937. He should therefore suffer 3 month’s rigorous imprisonment. The sentence will start from the date he was commitued to ixxistatjcx custody. 2.

The Bahrain Government issued a Proclamation m Jcunuary 1938 in the following terms t 'The public are informed that boys wno are of Bahrain Nationality are forbiddett to attend foreign schools in Bahrain unless tneir parents obtain permission to do so from the Bahrain Government'. Under tne Bahrain Nationality Law all persons born in Bahrain are considered to be Bahrain nationals unless those persons take steps (or their parents do it for them) to divest themselves of Bahrain Nationality in accordance with the procedure under Article 2 of the Law. The I'rocianation quoted was issued as the Bahrain Government found that teachers in Iranian private schools in Bahrain were preaching sentiments hostile to the Bahrain Government, and they saw no reason why children who are, under their Nationality law, subjects Bahrain should be exposed to such hostile propaganda. Sven so it will be observed that the prohibition is not absolute and that Iranian arents, for instance, can apply for permission for their children born in Bahrain to attend Iranian schools.

Complainant : Passport Officer, Bahrain, accused ? Husain Ali Bin Huhammad Charif. Charge : Breach of Passport Regulation. Cection : King’s Regulation Ho.2 of 1937. Order. Accused Husain All Bin Liuhammad Charif has 'oeen chargedp by the Passport Officer of the Bahrain Government for landing in Bahrain without a valid pass about five montns ago. 2. Accused admits tnat he came to Bahrain about five months 9 ago and had no pass but defends himself on the ground tnat he was living in Bahrain before, that when he went to Iran 3 years ago he obtained a return pass from the Bahrain Government I on payment of Re.l/-, that when he came this time from ,atar he showed that pass to Hakhuda of the boat by which he had come | and that the Hakhuda took the pass to Passport Officer and obtained permission for landing. The Hakhuda of course is not in Bahrain, nor does the accused know his where-abouts. 3. Now tne main point wnich needs consideration is whether a xmss issuea by the Bahrain Government on payment of Re.l/- is I valid for return. I have examined the schedule of rates ao. rovedj by the Bahrain Government for various type of travel documents ; issued by them and found that a pass issued to Iranis for Iran ' on payment of Re.l/- is not valid for return. Nor a return pass \ a fee of fe.3/- is levied. If a return pass is time-barred after one year and the holder is a man of good character, a fee of Rs. 2 /- is cnarged and the holder is allowed to land . In tne case of accused, in tne first place, ne states to have obtained a return pass on payment of Re.l/- and secondly, to have obtained through his Nakhuda, the permission of the Passport Officer to land without paying any fees. But both of these statements are false and it is a matter of common know ledge in Bahrain that neither a return pass is granted on payment of Re.l/- nor a man is allowed to land gratis when hi s/——— wm * m * '■ ~ * ^' @) I his return pass is time-barred. 4. Under these circumstances I am not ready to believe the defence story, but hold the accused guilty of the offence of : | entering Bahrain witnout a valid oass under section 1 of W -i. King’s Regulation Uo.2 of 1937 and order, under section 2 of the said Regulation, tnat he should suffer one month's rigorous j imprisonment for a period of 15 days. 5 .

Given under my hand and the seal of the Court this 10th day of May, 1938. Sd/- K. Weightman, District Magistrate, Bahrain. SealCriminal Case No, 49 of 1938 6^) Complainant : Passport Officer, Bahrain. Accused. : l.Jasim bin Muhammad al Moaidi, Iraqi. 2.Nakhuda I/fuhammad bin Abdullah Delebeh, Saudi Arabian. Charge : Breach of Passport Regulation. Section : King’s Regulation No. 2 of 1937. Order. The brief facts of this case are that accused No. 1 Jasim bin Muhammad Moaidi was refused permission to land in Bahrain on 25th torch 1938 when he arrived in the boat of accused No.2 Nakhuda Muhammad bin Abdullah Delebeh. Accused No. 1 landed several times but was sent back to the boat every time. On 27th March he was again found near the Customs gate and the Passport Officer sent him back again with the help of the Naturs end police who escorted him far out into the sea and came back when accused No. 2*s boat was well on its way to (^tif. But on 30th March accused No. 1 was again apprehended. Apparently accused No. 2 landed him somewhere in the island of Bahrain. 2. Accused No. 1 states that he had a pass when he came to Bahrain but the pass was valid for Iraq (Exhibit A) and not for Bahrain. When the Passport Officer did not allow him to land he escaped from accused No. 2 Nakhuda Muhammad bin Abdullah Delebeh and went to the Political Agency to obtain permission. He had gone to Qatar about 4 months ago and came back now from there. He landed in Bahrain because he could not go back to Qatar as he had run away from there with fugitive Nasir bin Khalid. 3. As it is evident from his own statement, accused No. 1 landed in Bahrain without a valid /passport2 passport after he had been warned by the Passport Officer not to do so - a circumstance which is quite sufficient to constitute an offence under section 1 of King’s Regulation No. 2 of 1937. His excuses that he could not go back and therefore escaped to the Political Agency to obtain permission to land are beside the point. as a matter of fact, he was not authorises to go to Qatar as in December last he was issued with and Emergency Certificate (Exhibit A) enabling him to go back to his native country Iraq. But instead of proceeding to Iraq he went to Qatar and again came back to Bahrain. His entry in Bahrain prior to December last was in the capacity of a Nekhuda, according to his own statement recorded in exhibit A, and as he had sold his boat and sailed out of Bahrain with the permission to go back to Iraq,his re-entry in Bahrain is a prima facie contravention of section 1 of King’s Regulation No. 2 of 1937. He should therefore, in pursuance of section 2 of the said Regulation, suffer 2 months’ rigorous imprison ment and pay a fine of Es. 50/-, or, in default of payment of fine, should suffer one month's further rigorous imprisonment. 4. As for accused No. 2 Nakhuda Muhammad bin Abdullah Delebeh there is no evidence against him showing that he landed accused No. 1 and abetted the offence of landing without a pass punishable under section 3 of the said Regulation. According to his own statement and according to the deposition of co accused No. 1, latter escaped from the former. I therefore, am not prepared to convict him of the offence of abetment and order that he should be acquitted. 5. The question of repatriation of accused No. l is referred to the District Court.

The Passport Officer of the Bahrain Government has complained that accused Nos.l to 7 - Muhammad Nuruddin, Muran Dil Murad, Jasam Saidi, Keya Abdur Rahman, Abdullah bin Muhammad, Dad Muharmiad Ahmad and Umar bin Salman - entered Bahrain without passports or permission. No prosecution evidence was produced as the accused themselves admitted the offence. Their only excuse is that they were starving in their country, and came to Bahrain to earn their livelihood. The fact that some of them reported their arrival without a pass to Passport Officer ana some of them to the quarantine Medical Officer does not mitigate the offence; nor does the unfortunate fact that they were starving in their mother land and came to Bahrain in search of employment. The fact at any rate remains that they infringed section 1 of King’s Regulation No.2 of 1937 and should be punished under section2 of the Regulation. I therefore order that they each should undergo one month’s rigorous imprisonment and should also each pay a fine of Rs.30/-. If they do not pay the fine, they should each suffer 15 days’ further rigorous imprisonment. 2.

Head of the third political department on instruction of Minister for Foreign Affairs made vigorous representations to me this morning in connexion with numerous and violent complaints now being received from reliable sources as regards treatment of Iranian subjects in Bahrain, 2. He prefaced that his remarks were without prejudice to his C government r s known attitude as regards the fneik and our own position towards him. They appealed to His Majesty’s Government because they themselves had no contact with the Bheik whereas we had and were a friend of the nation. 5. He alleged that in connexion with nationality and property laws some 200 Iranian families were oeing expelled and some 500 to 600 persons imprisoned including old persons women and children under atrocious conditions amounting to savagery, 4. He referred to recent mass expulsions by Boviet Government universally regarded as a savage act and contrasted Iranian Government’s own expulsion of a few Berberis lor whom much consideration was being shown. Were oheik not in such close relation to His Majesty’s Government the Iranian Government would be taking appropriate steps to meet these injuries to these Iranians in Bahrein. If savage methods employed were not remedied this could not fail to affect Anglo-Persian relations adversely. The Iranian Government therefore drew His Majesty’s Government T sGovernment's attention to the position and asked that urgent enquiry should be made and His Majesty's Government give their good offices. 5. The question of sovereignty was a matter for friendly settlement at some future time; pending this the Sheik should not have taken provocative action.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 565-N/37, of the 25th November 1937 and to reply as follows. 2. There are two separate processes of law involved (a) that of prohibition under^section 21 of the Bahrain Order in Council and (b) that of deportation under section 22. 3. With regard to (b), under Article 22(3) there is a pngnp-prTv proviso M unless the Chief Court thinks fit other wise to direct n . This would appear to give the Political Resident (as Chief Court) power of confirmation on depor tation orders made by the District Court (in this case the Political Agent, Bahrain). As I read it this makes a prior reference to the Political Resident imperative in deportation orders made by the District Court. Similarly such nrior reference is provided for under the Kuwait Ordter in Council in section 24|1| respectively. 4. As regards (a) there is nothing in section 21(1) of the Bahrain Order in Council which gives the Political Resident any nwer to vary or revoke an order made by the Political Agent tkxx though the latter himself xas has this power under section 21(2). To give the political Resident such a power would entail the making of an Order in Council, and personally I do not think that this would be worth while. The same remarks apply to orders of prohibi tion made under section 23(1) of the Kuwait Order in Councils 5 letter5. I have already circularised Political Agents Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat drawing their attention to certain provisions of the sections dealing with deportation and prohibition, and I think this should prevent misuse of the powers in question.Copy sent to Tehran 2nd December 1937, from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf, to the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, new Delhi.

A copy of the order is * enclosed* 2. The facts of the case and the grounds on which the order has been passed are given in the Judgment of the Political Agent, Bahrain, in criminal case No.224 of 1937, of which I enclose a copy for the information of the Govern ment of India. Briefly, the two accused were found guilty of offences under Section 186 and Section 332 of the Indian Penal Code in having assaulted a Bahrain police man. The sentence passed is in effect an Order of prohibition (amounting-to deportation) 'with a fine in each case as an appanage. The orders were passed by the Court on the 24th September, 1937, and executed 2 days later. 3. The convictions v/ere in my judgment entirely justi fied in law and on the facts, but I consider the sentences in one case at least to err on the side of severity, it being remembered that the two accused had already been aub- jected to considerable fines in the judicial case. As, kowever, the orders were executed before being brought to rhy notice, I do not advise intervention or revocation at i this stage, and no substantial purpose would be served’ty taking/- r--PI Itfgl taking up the judicial case on revision. 4. The Bahrain Order in Council in common with other Orders in Council in force in the Persial G-ulf in effect confers power on the political Agent to deport both British subjects and foreigners without reference to higher* autho- nty and without the necessity for confirmation. I have examined two recent cases of action under this and a similar Order in Council. In a case which arose in Bahrain - of &amp; more serious nature than the present - (see Memorandum from the Political Resident,to the Foreign Secretary to the ^ Government of India, No.1139 of the 1st June, 1936), I observe that the Political Agent reported by telegram to the Political Resident his intention of proceeding to pass orders of deportation some days before orders were passed; while in a similar case which arose in Muscat (see Memoran dum from the Political R e sident, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, No.336 of the 17th February, 1937) the Political Agent obtained the approval of the political Resident before proceeding to pass orders of deportation. It appears, therefore, that in previous cases the Resident has by local convention received prior intimation of pro posals to pass orders of deportation. In the present case no such notice was received, end indeed no such notice is required by the Order m Council. o. It appears to me desirable to draw a distinction as far as Bahrain is concerned between deportat ion of British subjects and deportation of foreigners. The latter tower is com: only exercised by specified authorities in British Dominions and in India, while the deportation of British subjects, including of course Indian British subjects, by a British authority from the limits of a State in the special position of Bahrain would appear to be a very special power, the exercise of which calls for discretion, lf/if it is not to evoke criticism difficult to resist* I consider that orders of deportation against British sub jects require some check, end that this could best be exercised, not by prior consultation between the District Court and the Political Resident ( a course which must deprive the Political Agent of much of his initial respon- sioility for the maintenance of law end order) but by requiring such orders to await execution until receipt of the confirmation of the Political Resident* Such a pro vision, which could be effected, if necessary, by am&lt;mdment of the Order in Council, would act as a sufficient check on any tendency towards a too arbitrary use of a special power, and would appear to be in accordance with general administrative principle. It frequently happens that the temporary charge of the Bahrain Agency is in the hands of a very junior officer. The effect of the proposed amend ment ?/ould be to regularise a procedure which appears to have been followed in previous cases but was omitted in the particular case under reference* The consequent delay in carrying out orders would no doubt cause some incomrenionce in arrangements for custody, but this is not insurmountable* In a case of real emergency confirmation could be sought by telegram, and in any case the Bahrain Government are engaged in providing suitable accommodation including a European lock up. In the case of Europeans it should not be impossible to arrange with the Company for release on bail or parole pending final decision of the case* 6. The Government of India will no doubt desire to obtain the views of Sir Trenchard Fowle on his return on the proposals contained in this letter.Crder_bx_the_District_Qourt_ JL _Bahr9in.

G-iven under my hand and the sea,l oi the Court this 24th day of September 1937. Sd/- T. Hicken Botham Captain, political Agent, BahrainCriminal Case No*224 of 1937 JJJJLGJOJL-L,. A report was made that an offence was alleged to have been committed punishable under Section 332 of the Indian Penal Code at about 10 p.m. on Thursday the 16th September 1937 on the premises of the Bahrain petroleum Company. I received' this report on Saturday the 18th of September on my return from Sharjah. The case was com pleted and presented in my Court on Tuesday the 21st of Sept ember. After hearing the evidence of P.W. 1&gt; 2, end 3 and recording the statement of the accused persons I decided that there was a prima facie case for the accused to answer and I framed charges against them under Section 332 of the Indian Penal Code. This was on the 21st of Septem ber. Both the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge# The evidence of P.W. 4, 0, and 6 was recorded end the evidence of P.W. 7 and 8 was recorded later. At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the Court examined Mr Boone as a Court Witness and the further statements of the accused were then taken. Accused No.l stated that he had no evidence to produce in his defence and accused No.2 produced two defence v/itnesses whose depositions were recorded. The case was complete in as far as evidence was concerned on the 23rd of September. The prosecution story is that about five minutes past ten on the night of the 16th of September the acciused persons, Thomas Scott and Henry Mulhern, both of whom are British subjects, came to the Transport Office of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and endeavoured to obtain trans portation for travelling from the New Camp to Number One * Camp/-Camp* Itia alleged that the clerk stated that he was unacle to proviae them with transport and suggested that they should wait for the bus which was due in about 20 minutes. It appears that they were not prepared to wait ior the bus and v/anted a special motor and a quarrel ensued between the Transport Clerk who is P.W.2, Hamza bin Mohammad, and the two accused persons. During the course of this quarrel it is alleged that the accused threatened the Transport Clerk and when the Transport Clerk rang up Mr. Pfeffercorn who is the Head of the Transport Branch of the Oil Company to ask him for orders Accused No.l caught hold of the telephone. P # W* 1, Dawood bin Salman, a police constable of the Bahrain Police, who was on duty in the neighbourhood, heard a cry of Police 1 and went into the Transport Office to see what was happening. He entered the Transport Office but took no action until the two accused came out. When the accused came out of the Transport Office it is alleg ed that the constable P.W. 1 told them to go away as he considered that they were likely to assault p # f. 2, and thereupon Thomas Scott, Accused No.l, is alleged to have taken him by the throat and Henry Mulhern, Accused No.2, is alleged to have struck him on the jaw. The police man’s cane was broken by Accused No.l and a general fight is said to have ensued between the two men and the police* man. It is alleged, however, that Accused No.l did not take a very active part in the fight and after the beginning he stood on one side and watched the proceedingt A number of people, lorry drivers and coolies, collected and stood and watched the scene making no efforts to interfere. Mr x Boone who is m charge of the Special Constables at the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s premises was informed but by the time he arrived the fight was over and the policeman was bleeding from the nose and had several/-V several minor facial injuries* The policeman was sent to tne dispenser who rendered first aid. The complainant and 7 witnesses gave evidence for the prosecution and the evidence that was given by the individual witnesses is in accord with the alleged tacts of the case. There are minor discrepancies but they are not of great importance. Accused No.l denies that he struck the policeman first and m fact he denies that he ever struck the police man at all. He contends that the policeman struck him on the arm with his cane first and that he contented himself with removing the cane from the policeman and breaking it and shaking his fist in th^policeman*s face. He does not deny that he threatened the policeman. Accused No.2 states that the policeman struck him first and that when he was struck he lost his head and had a tussle with the policeman. Accused No.2 produced two witnesses for the defence who testified to having seen certain marks which possibly might have been caused by a cane on the left shoulder of the accused, the following day. These witnesses were not pre sent at the scene of the disturbance and simply testified to the fact that these marks were present. Itis required to prove in order to sustain a charge under Section 332 of the Indian Penal Code that (a) the accused caused hurt; (d) the person hurt was a public servant; (c) the accused did so in consequence of some thing done or attempted to be done by the public servant in the lawful discharge of his duty. With regard to (a). It is admitted by Accused No.2i Henry Muibern, that he caused hurt to the police constable Dawood bin Salman. It is riot admitted by accused No.l. The evidence of P.W.l, 2 and 4 goes to show that Accused No. 1 did assault the policeman and did cause hurt to him for it/-it is not possible to assault a person by striking him without causing hurt* However, the remaining prosecution witnesses appear doubtful whether Accused No * 1 did actually strike P*W. 1 or whether his action was confined to break ing the cane belonging to P*W. 1 and shaking his fist in the policeman's face with various threatening remarks* I am doubtful whether hurt was actually caused to the police man by accused No.1. With regard to (b)* There is no doubt and it has not been contested by the accused that the injured person, i*e*, Dawood bin Salman, is a public servant and was a public servant at the time of the occurrence. It appears from evidence that he was wearing uniform and also his red pugree so that there was no question of his not being recognised as a police constable* Thirdly with regard to (c)* The primary duty of the police is to preserve law and order* The constable was attracted to the scene of the occurrence at the Transport Office by a cry of 'Police'* From whom the cry emanated is not clear and is not material* There is sufficient evidence to show that a cry of police did arise. On the constable's arrival at the Transport Officelhe found the accused using threatening gestures and language to P.W.2 who was the Transport Clerk* He states in his evidence that he was afraid that they might assault the Trare port Clerk and when they did leave the office he endeavoured to prevent them from re-entering again* He stated that he told them to go* He spoke in Arabic but it is quite clear trom the statements of the accused that they understood his meaning. He was justified in interfering in as much as he is a police constable and therefore responsible for the preservation of order, and he considered in his estimation that there was about to be a breach ofpeace. Whether a breach of peace would have occurred or not is possibly doubtful/(1st) out tnat does not affect the issue* The point is that thi constable considered that a breach of the peace was likely*, The best course that he could have taken would have been * to send one oi the b^tanders to the police post to call up the European Special Constables while he watched the proceedings ready to interfere should the necessity arise# He should have refrained from interference until the last possible‘moment and hoped that the v/hite constables would arrive in time to take up charge of the situation* I suggest that general instructions on these lines be issued to the Bahrain Police. The constable had a difficult decision to make and he came to the conclusion that the Europeans ought to leave and he gave them a perfectly legitimate order to do so. The result of this order was xirsL to cause them amusement and afterwards to irritate tnem* a fight ensued during the course of which there is no doubt that the policeman used his cane. Itji s quite clear to me that it is proved that the public servant in this case was in the discharge of his duty and that the accused, both of them, endeavoured to prevent him from dis charging his duty. It is further my opinion that Accused ko*k caused hurt to the public servant with intent to pre vent that public servant from discharging his duty* I am doubtful whether hurt was actually caused to the public servant by Accused No.l but I am quite convinced that Accused ho.l threatened the policeman and obstructed him in every y® way possible# So much for the facts of the case and v/hat is to be proved. Both the accused were under the influence of alq#ohol. Accused No.l was slightly so and Accused No.2 was more so, and their conduct during the events which form the basis of this charge was in my opinion due almost entirely to the fact that they had had too much to drink. On carefully examining the evidence I do not consider that/tnat* an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Indian Fenal Code has been proved against Accused No.l; but I do consider that he is guilty of an offence punishable under Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code i,e*, obstructing a pub lic servant in the discharge of his public functions* The case against Accused No.2 under Section 332 is clearly proved and I find him guilty of the offence for which he has been charged* Before deciding the question of sentence there are two points to be considered* The first point is the accused 1 s plea of provocation* I have read the evidence carefully and examined the statements of the accused persons themselves but it appears that the policeman and not the accused could more properly plead pro vocation* The accused were engaged in an angry altercation with the Clerk of the Transport Office* Some one calls for police. A policeman comes up as a policeman would whether in jilnglend or Arabia. He thinks a breach of the peace probable* He tells the two individuals‘concerned to g o away* In the words of Accused No.l the reply which he received from Accused No.l was to 'shut his mouth'. The reply which he receivedf rom Accused No.2 was a laugh* The police constable was restrained m his behaviour and there was not the slight est provocation beyond the fact that the constable was not an European. With regard to this point it must be quite clearly understood by all Europeans and .Americans in Bahrain that a policeman is a policeman whether he is black or whether he is white and that the offence of striking a policeman is, if any thing, more serious when the policeman is not an European* It is the duty of all Americans and Europeans to assist the police m every possible way, especially in a place like Bahrain where the local police look to white people to assist them and aid them m the execution of their duty. They are the people to whom the police have a right to turn for assist ance. If persons consider that police constables whether in _.urope or whether in Arabia have m any w a y exceeded their ' duty/(f^) duty tney are entitled to lodge a complaint with the proper authority but nothing entitles them to take the law into their own hands* The conduct of these two Englishmen was disgraceful* They considered that the policeman was an inferior individual and could have no possible control over their movements. What they would have realised had they been sober was that the constable was doing his best m the iac£ of considerable odds to prevent a breach of peace. No coloured policeman wishes to have a distrubance with white people. The majority of them are accustomed to look on white people as people of a superior class from whom they are accustomed to taking orders and it is extreme ly difficult and requires considerable moral courage for a policeman of this type to take action, which he is bound by his duty, against Europeans. The second point which I wish to bring out is that prohibition exists in the Bahrain Islands, but by the courtesy of His Highness the Shaikh the Political Agent is permitted to issue licences for the import of alcoholic liquor to people whom he personally considers are fit to » hold a licence provided they are not Mohammedans. This means that it is in the Political Agent’s discretion to see that no alcoholic liquor is imported by persons who are likely to abuse the privilege, i.e., by persons who are like -ly to use alcohol to excess and create a disturbance through the us e of alcohol, or in any other way disgrace themselves and their community. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are permitted, under a licence from the Political Agent with the sanction of His Highness the Ruler, to import liquor for the consumption of their employees and they make various rules and regulations to ensure to the best of their ability that the liquor is consumed by their employees with decorum and m moderation. Unfortunately recently there have been several cases which have come to my notice - most of/of them unofficially - of cases of drunkenness and distur bances which have been directly caused owing to the excessive consumption of alcohol by the individuals concern ed* If these cases have come to my notice then there is lUcJC no doubtjt&amp;ey they have come to the notice of His Highness the Shaikh. In my opinion the present incident would never have occurred if the accused persons had been sober. Occurrences of this kind have got to cease. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are doing their best but they have not been altogether successful and if these occurrences contin ue there is no doubt that very serious steps which might even lead to the Political Agent cancelling the licence to import alcohol would have to be taken to prevent disorders of this sort. I consider that in this case an example must be made and I am therefore going to impose a heavier penalty than may altogether be warranted by the actual circumstances of the case in order to make it quite clear to the inhabitants of Bahrain that policeman cannot be assaulted with impunity and that an excessive consumption of alcohol will not be tolerated. The penalty to which I refer is not the actual sentence but the order which follows the sentence in this case. I find accused iMo.l, Thomas Scott, guilty of an offence punishable under Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code and order him to pay a fine of Rs.100/-. I find Accused No.2, Henry Mulhern, guilty of an offence for which he has been charged punishable under Section 532 of the Indian Penal Code and order him to pay a fine of Rs.1-50/-. This offence is more serious than that committed by accused No.l but the circumstances of the accused do not permit of a larger fine being imposed and I am unwilling to order imprisonment as this is a first offence and the loss of v/ork and disgrace of being removed from the country are in my opinion sufficient punishment m combination with the small fine.9 It is further ordered that as it has been shown by evidence on oath to my satisfaction in my capacity as District and Sessions Judge that the two persons named in this judgment have committed an offence against the Bahrain Order-m-Oouncil, they be prohibited under Article 21 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council from being within the limits of the said Bahrain Order-in-Council for a period of one year.

P.Femandez, S.Fernandez and D.Fernandez, were found guilty on September 24th 1936 in the Court of 3 the Assistant Political Agent, under section \53 of the Indian Penal Code, of the offence of assaulting a public servant, namely a member of the Bahrain State Police, in the execution of his duty, and sentenced to six months Rigorous Imprisonment. 2o They were produced in front of me on the 6th October and called on to show cause why they should not be prohibited from being within the limits of the Bahrain Order in Council. They had no statement to make and an order under Section 21 of the Bahrain Order in Council has been made against them. 3. It is my opinion very undesirable to permit persons of this type to remain in Bahrain. They are new comers to the Island and their return to India will have an excellent effect on any other persons who may consider that to obstruct or strike a Police Officer /• r» in the execution of his duty is not a most serious offenceoINDIA OFFICE, &gt; it P.L 9156/36 WHITEHALL, S.vf.l. 2nd January, 1936 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary ol State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary oi otate Dated' 10th December, 1936 ) for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter with enclosure. ) from the Government of India regarding an order of prohibition passed, under the provisions of ohe Bahrain Order in Council, against three Portuguese subjects. 2.

RECa. • * &gt; Dated New Delhi, the /£/rf December 1936. Subject:- Order of prohibition passed three Portuguese subjects by dnst ie Political Agent, Bahrain. q ) s'. Sir, a ,533 I am directed to forward for information a copy of memorandum from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 2125 dated the 19th October, 1936, and its 18/266 enclosure, and to say that in Article 4 of the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913, H British subject** is defined as including a British protected person and **foreigner w as meaning any person not a British or Bahrain subject. The persons against whom the order of prohibition has been passed are described as Portuguese subjects and as such are to be regarded as foreigners and although such persons can come within the meaning of the expression “person to whom this Order applies'* as explained in Article 8, they cannot be considered as covered by the expression “British subjects’* in Article 21(1). The Government of India are, therefore, of opinion that the order passed by the Political Agent, Bahrain, against these Portuguese subjects is ultra vires . 2. The Political Agent, Bahrain, could presumably have deported the persons concerned under an inherent right to exclude undesirable foreigners (cf. Oppenheim, Part I,Chapter 2VIII). If this presumption is correct, there would appear to bebe no necessity for any kind of legislation to enable the Political Agent to order such deportations in the future. He should however effect such deportations by simple executive order and not refer to Article 21 of the Bahrain Order in Council. it is requested that the Government of India may kindly be informed whether His Majesty's Government agree with their views in order that instructions may issue to the Political Agent for his future guidance. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant for Foreign Secretary to the India. v.
