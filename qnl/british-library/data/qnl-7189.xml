GEOGRAPHY PHYSICAL AND POLITICAL (1) Position and Frontiers The geographical limits ol' Mesopotamia cannot be precisely defined, except on the east, where the delimi tation of the boundary between Turkey and Persia was completed by a Turko-Persian Commission in 1914. The frontier then determined, which is shown on the accompanying map, lies along the mountains forming the western rim of the Persian plateau, and reaches the Shatt el-Arab 10 miles above Muhammera. The remaining boundaries of the'area dealt with in this account are roughly as follows: to the south the Persian Gulf; to the south-west the desert of northern Arabia; to the west the Syrian desert; and to the north the mountains of Armenia and Asia Minor. The area is approximately 180,000 square miles. (2) Surface, Coast, and River System Surface Mesopotamia as a whole consists of a great depres sion running south-east from the north-western corner of Syria and the mountains of Armenia down to the head of the Persian Gulf. Under the high mountains which enclose Mesopotamia on the north-east is a belt of lower hill country, varying in breadth from 40 to 100 miles, and below this again are the Mesopotamian plains which form the floor of the depression. Not far to the north of Baghdad the upper plains end in a [285—66] B2 GEOGRAPHY [No. 92 drop of 20-50 ft., marking a former coast line, and the great alluvial plain of Irak begins. This district, lying between the Euphrates and Tigris, is exceedingly fertile: its area is about 35,000 square miles. In general the surface of the upper plain country de creases in fertility from north to south. Lower Mesopotamia. —Tn Irak the only noticeable eminences are the mounds that mark the sites of dead cities, the high banks of old canal-beds, and here and there knolls or slight ridges of gravel or sand. The slope of the Irak plains from the neighbourhood of Baghdad to the Persian Gulf is very slight. Baghdad is 105 ft. above sea-level, Kut el-Amara on the Tigris 55 ft., Nasrie on the Euphrates 15 ft., Basra 8 ft. There are also very gradual transverse inclines away from the rivers (due to the heightening of the river beds by the deposit of silt), and a slope from the foot of the Persian hills to the neighbourhood of the Tigris; these, in so far as they determine the present flood- areas and marshes, have great importance for the culti vation of the country as it is to-day, and also for pro jects of irrigation. The soil is mainly an argillaceous, calcareous loam of great fertility; but by far the greater part of the country is either marshland or arid waste. In the southern part of Irak there are extensive permanent swamps, the water of which rises and falls with the season. Tn addition, the winter and spring floods of the rivers overflow into wide inundations, which gener ally dry up in the latter part of the summer, but some times, when they have no adequate outlets, may remain standing for some years. The position and extent of these temporary flood areas vary, within certain limits, from year to year. Where and.when the country is not swamp, it is for the most part open plain. Cultivation is almost entirely limited to the neighbourhood-of the rivers and canals. The Arabian desert, where it borders on south western Irak, is a fairly hard gravelly plain, broken in places by belts and patches of sand. Tt is interMesopotamia] SURFACE 3 sected by wadis (water-courses, dry except after rain) running towards the Euphrates. The rains produce some grass vegetation, which for a time affords a- fair amount of camel-grazing. The usual low desert scrub is also found. West of the Euphrates, from Hit down to Nejef, the Syrian desert (Hamad) has the same general character. Upper Mesopotamia. —The plains of the Jezireh (El-Jezire, 'the island'), which lie between the Tigris and Euphrates, extend to about 48,000 sq. miles. They are generally more or less undulating, though they contain some wide expanses of flat country. Here and there they are traversed by ranges of hills; most of these are quite low, but the Jebel Sin jar, a line of basalt hills west of Mosul, rises to some' 3,000 ft. above the surrounding country; the surface of the plains is open and treeless. A great part of the northern Jezireh has a good soil, and large areas could be brought under cultivation by means of irrigation works. South of the Jebel Sinjar and the lower Khabur the plain becomes increasingly arid, and towards its lower end turns to a hard desert, the surface of which is composed of gravel, gypsum, marl, borax, or sand. There are also lar^e areas in which water from wadis collects, and on evaporation leaves an incrustation of salt. On the western and eastern sides of the Jezireh the Euphrates and Tigris have cut for themselves shallow valleys or troughs 1 to 5 miles wide, bordered by low hills or cliffs. At the bottom of these valleys occur stretches of alluvium where the rivers have deposited their sediment in flood-time. Parts of the Euphrates trough are moderately cultivated; elsewhere the valley is either bare or filled with tamarisk and other scrub. I here is a considerable amount of cultivation along the I tanks of the Tigris between Mosul and the mouth of the Great Zab. South of the Lesser Zab, down to the beginning of the alluvial plain near Beled, the river valley is mostly untilled. The southern plains, east of the middle Tigris, are open steppes of clay and f 285—66 1 y} 24 GEOGRAPHY [No. 92 gravel, clothed with grass in spring. The country in the region of the Zabs has a fertile soil. The lower hill-country, east of Kifri, Kirkuk, Altun Keupri, and Erbil, consists either of rolling downs or of lines of rocky heights in which sandstone pre dominates. In spring the downs and valleys have much grass on them. Between this region and the higher ranges are the well-watered upland plains of Sulei manie and Rania. Along the Persian frontier is the high mountain country of southern Kurdistan. It is well watered by numerous streams flowing through deep valleys or gorges into the Lesser Zab. Central Kurdistan is the most difficult section of the mountain barrier that divides Mesopotamia from Armenia and north-western Persia. The mountains rise to heights of 11,000 to 14,000 ft., their sides are generally barren and sparsely wooded; the valleys and lower slopes contain patches of cultivable ground. The plain of the Jezireh is bounded on the north by the Jebel Tur or Tur Abdin plateau (east of Mardin), and by the hill-country which has its centre and highest point in the Karaja (Qarajeh) Dagh. On the western side of the plateau there is a depression, which affords an important line of communication between Diarbekr on the north and the great Mesopotamian plain. The soil of the Jebel Tur, though much overlaid with stones, is often fertile; but water is scarce in summer. The least stony and best-watered part of the plateau is the north-western, towards Diarbekr. The country bordering the middle Euphrates valley on the west is arid desert in its southern part, and becomes gradually less arid towards the north. Coast Mesopotamia touches the sea only on a narrow front at the head of the Persian Gulf. Desert, marsh, and inundation make the coast difficult of access from the land, Shallows and mud-banks obstruct approachMesopotamiaj COAST O trom the Gulf. The bar at the mouth of the Shatt el- Arab needs dredging to make it passable at all tides by large ocean-going steamers. West of the Shatt el- Arab the Khor Zobeir, which runs up into the desert towards Basra, has fairly deep water for a part of its length; but its approaches from land and sea, its con figuration and dimensions, appear to make it unsuit able for regular use as a harbour. Hiver System The Euphrates and Tigris drain the Armenian table land, the western side of the Persian plateau, the hill country of northern Mesopotamia, and the Mesopo- tamian plains. Lhe two rivers unite at Kurna into a single stream, which reaches the Persian Gulf under the name of the Shatt el-Arab. The volume of water in the Euphrates and Tigris varies considerably at different periods of the year The great increase during certain months is caused by rainfall and melting snow in the highlands of Armenia, Kurdistan, and Persia. I he low-water se&amp;son may be said to last from July to November, the high-water season from December to June. Both rivers, and especially the Tigris, are liable to rise in sudden and violent spates, ajid bring down a great quantity of sediment in the high-water season. The Euphrates between Feluja and Diwaniya flows at a higher level than the Tigris between Bagh dad and Kut el-Amara, and the country between the rivers in north-western Irak is therefore flooded mainly from the Euphrates. Just below Museyib (70 miles by river below Eeluja) the Euphrates divides into two large branches, called the Shatt Hindie and the Shatt Hilla, which join again 110 miles further down near Samawa: Between 1865 and 1890 the main stream shifted from the eastern (Hilla) branch to the western (Hindie). After several unsuccessful at tempts to check the process, which was threatening to dry up the Hilla branch altogether, the new Hindie barrage and the Hilla regulator were constructedGEOGRAPHY (No. 92 (1913) to regulate the flow of water down the two channels. From Nasrie downwards the Euphrates, now flowing at a lower level than the Tigris, receives from the north a great quantity of Tigris water, which finds its way through the canals and marshes between the two rivers. The volume of the Euphrates, thus increased, is beyond the capacity of the channel leading to Kurna (called the Old Channel), and most of the Euphrates water is forced southwards, and forms a large area of open water and swamp, through w r hich the New Channel drains into the Shatt el-Arab at Gurmat All, a few miles above Basra. The Tigris is liable to flood more or less of the neighbourhood of its banks from above Baghdad down to Kut el-Amara. At the latter place a large channel, the Shatt el-Hai, branches southward from the light bank of the Tigris and reaches the Euphrates just below Nasrie. Below Kut el-Amara more and more flocd- water drains southwards into swamps, and fears have been expressed that unlesg preventive measures are taken the Tigris may altogether leave its present bed below Amara. (3) Climate The climatic conditions of Mesopotamia are those of a sub-tropical area which lies at a distance from any ocean, and they are, therefore, in the plains and low T er uplands, of a semi-arid type. The following tables give the mean daily maximum and the mean daily minimum temperature in the hottest and coldest months respectively. Mean daily maximum, July and August Basra, 104° E. (40° C.). Baghdad, 110° F. (43° C % ). Mosul, 109° E. (43° C.). Mean daily minimum, December and January;— Basra, 47° E. (8° C.). Baghdad. 40° E. (4° C.). Mosul, 36° E. (2° C.).Mesopotamia, CLIMATE 7 In northern Irak absolute maxima of over 120° F. (49° C.) are rea-ched in July and August. At Basra, however, where the neighbouring marshes keep the humidity of the air at a high level during the summer months, the heat is more trying than in the dryer atmo sphere of Baghdad. In the mountains bordering on the Mesopotamia!! depression the summer is temperate, and the cold in winter is severe, especially on the edge of the Armenian plateau. In the plains and lower bills the rainy season lasts from November to April; December, January, February, and March are the wettest months. In lower Mesopo tamia many places may have no rain at all from June to October. In upper Mesopotamia there is usually a slight fall in May, and, at least in some places, a very little in June, September, and October, while July and August are rainless. The amount of rainfall decreases from north to south. At the northern end of the Jezireh plains and in the uplands of Diarbekr the total fall in the year is 13-16 in. (330-410 mm.), in Irak it is only 2^-7 in. (57-179 mm.), and a large proportion of the total often falls in one day. Snow falls in northern Mesopotamia in December and January, and sometimes in February or even March. The main thaw and heavy rains come in March and April, and cause the great spring floods on the rivers of Mesopotamia. The prevailing winds in the Mesopotamia!! lowlands are from the north-west; blowing with some freshness at intervals from June to August, they mitigate the heat and help to reduce the floods. (4) Sanitary Conditions The principal disease of the country is malaria. This is worst in the neighbourhood of marshes and inundation-areas, and it is therefore especially prevalent in lower Mesopotamia, and above all in the swamps of southern Irak. In the plains during the8 GEOGRAPHY ;No. 92 summer months fatiguing work in the open, espe cially in a humid atmosphere, is likely to bring on heat stroke. Epidemics of cholera and bubonic plague occur from time to time. On the whole, how r ever, if proper precautions can be taken, particularly w r ith regard to water, the health conditions for Europeans, outside malaria-infested districts, may be regarded as fairly good. Under Ottoman rule the towns have been left in a most unhealthy condition. -Almost the only sanitary measures taken by the Turkish authorities have been those of quarantine. (5) Race and Language The numbers of the various races which form the population of Mesopotamia may be estimated roughly as follows r 1 Arabs .. , 1.450,000 Armenians .. .. 57,000 Kurds .. .. 380,000 Yezidis .. .. 21,000 Turks and Turkomans 110,000 Chabaks .. .. 10,000 Persians .. .. 70,000 Circassians .. .. 8 ,000 Jews .. .. 60,000 Sabians ... .. 2,000 Syrian Christians ., 60,000 Miscellaneous .. 10,000 Total .. .. 2,238,000 The floating population of pilgrims to the Shiah shrines, which may number 150,000 to 200,000 in a year, is not included in the above estimate. The Arabs are, both numerically and politically, the dominant element in the population. They number probably about a million and a half, and if united among themselves would constitute a factor of the highest importance in the general situation. Differ ences, however, of religion, character, pursuits, and interests constitute intersecting lines of cleavage which have effectually prevented any enduring combination. Those Arabs w T ho are dwellers in the towms, or settled on the land as agriculturists, are for the most part 1 In the absence of reliable statistics), no accurate estimate of. tho population can be given.Mesopotamia, RACE 9 satisfactory members of the community; about one- half of the total number consists, however, of nomad or semi-nomad tribes, and it is they who have hitherto placed insuperable obstacles in the way of the develop ment of the country. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the towns, which are few in number, Mesopotamia is a tribal country; the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra are almost entirely apportioned into areas which various tribes occupy in virtue of an ancient prescrip tive right. These tribes have maintained for 4,000 years the system of patriarchal government, and, although for the sake of convenience many families are collected together under the rule of one chief, he can only govern so long as he has the majority in his favour. The Muntihk, the Beni-Lam, and the Shammar are among the principal Arab tribes in Turkish territory, and nominally under Turkish authority. The position of the Chaab tribe has been the cause of much friction; 1 originally Turkish, the tribe came after 1740 to acquire a permanent footing in Persian territory in the neighbourhood of the Karun, and since 1768 has been virtually independent of Turkey. About the year 1745 four-fifths of the land inhabited by the Chaab belonged unquestionably to Persia, and the tribe appears to have been regarded as naturalised Persian subjects, renting certain Turk ish property as foreigners. The Ottoman Govern ment has not exercised control, over the Chaab since 1768, and Turkish claims to the allegiance of the tribe since that date seem to be unfounded. Indeed, only a limited authority has existed even over those tribes admittedly within the bounds of Ottoman juris diction, and tribal jealousies have been deliberately fostered by the Turkish administration from inability to exercise effective control. Each tribe has been assessed at a certain revenue, and. so long as that is paid, it is practically exempt from Turkish authority. The collection of the revenue frequently ' See Foreign Office Memoranda. Confidential, Nos. 10015 and 10021.JO G eographv [No. 92 leads to friction, and sometimes to open rebellion, with disastrous effects on the country. On such occasions trailic is held up, crops are destroyed, and the banks of the rivers are broken down. The Arab 'knows well that he can make better terms when obstructing the trade than when living under the protection of the Government.' 1 The Arab is generally intelligent, quick, and ini~ pressionable; often he has a certain subtlety of mind which is capable of a high state of cultivation. But he is slovenly and uncreative in practical matters, and is lacking in the power of co-operation and of sus tained labour in the face of difficulties. He has a natural bent for intrigue, is much under the sway of personal ambitions and jealousies, and is very much of a time-server. Tor the wilder tribesman blackmail and thieving are normal and proper ways of earning a living. The Marsh Arabs,' or Ma'adam, who are found on both banks of the Tigris between Amara and Kurna and in the neighbourhood of the lower Euphrates below Suk esh-Sheyukh, are a peculiar people, non- Arab in origin, living mainly by fishing and the pro duce of their herds of bnffaioes, but cultivating here and there a little rice. The Kurds predominate in the hills, and, since many of them dwell in Persian territory, their lawless ness has occasioned much trouble on the Turko-Persian frontier. They have little tribal cohesion, and are addicted to blood feuds. The Kurd has not the in telligence, subtlety, and imagination of the Arab, but of the two he is the more industrious and capable worker. In danger he is cooler and steadier, he has a better physique, and altogether has greater physical and mental stamina. But he is also more callous than the Arab, and is extraordinarily reckless about taking human life. He has the makings of a good cultivator and a good workman, but has generally 1 Memoir \)ij Com tHundcr Felix Jones. y&amp;J J .OPMesopotamia I RACE 11 neither the good nor the bad qualities that are likely to make a successful trader. The Turks, as the governing race in Mesopotamia, occupied the majority of the official positions, both civil and military. A few thousand of the inhabitants of Baghdad claimed Turkish origin, often without justification. There is a Turkoman population in the neighbourhood of Tuz Khurmatli, Kirkuk, and Altun Keupri. Turkomans are also found in the plains east of Mosul, and west of Mosul at Tel Afar. The Persians in Mesopotamia concentrate especially at the Shiah holy cities in Irak; thus at Kerbela they form the majority of the population; at Nejef they constitute about a third. They number several thousands in Baghdad, where they are for the most part engaged in trade. There are a few Persians in the towns towards the Turko-Persian frontier, and some have recently come from the Gulf coast to work as labourers in southern Irak. There are Jewish communities hi the principal towns of Mesopotamia, particularly in Baghdad, where the Jews number perhaps about 50,000. They form an important element in commercial affairs, and the trade of Baghdad and Basra is much under their control. The Syrian Christians dwell principally in northern Mesopotamia. There are also a few thousand in Baghdad. Armenians are found chiefly in the Diarbekr vilayet; there are also a certain number in Baghdad, where many are wealthy men of business. There are some thousands of Yezidis in the Jebel Sin jar. and also in the neighbourhood of Mosul. They form a marked group, owing to their peculiar religion. Very few are left of the Circassians settled in Mesopotamia b)^ the Turkish Government after the Russian War of 1877. Their numbers have been reduced by their failure to adapt themselves to the climate, and by quarrels with their neighbours. Other groups, such as the Sabians, Chabaks, Indians, Afghans, Pathans, and Lurs, number only a very fewGEOGRAPHV •No. 92 thousands, and are of no political importance in the country. The total number of Europeans resident in the country before the war was perhaps about 200; they were missionaries (French, British, and American), representatives of commercial enterprises and engi neers (chiefly British and German), consuls, and archaeologists. The missionaries were principally in upper Mesopotamia, the Europeans engaged in busi ness or engineering work were mostly in Irak and in Arabistan over the Persian boundary. The principal European business communities were at Baghdad, Basra, and Muhammera. Except among the mission aries, there were few Europeans who could be regarded as permanently settled in the country. The distribution of languages in Mesopotamia follows the distribution of races. Arabic naturally predominates, but Persian is of considerable impor tance for commerce, and Kurdish dialects are commonly spoken in certain districts. The Arme nians have their own language. Syriac is spoken by the Christians of the Central Kurdish highlands. Various dialects of Turkish are spoken by Turks and Turkomans. As regards European languages, the commercial and social predominance of French in other parts of the Turkish Empire has its influence on Mesopotamia. A certain acquaintance with French is to be found among members of the wealthy business class in the chief trade-centres, and the higher Turkish officials usually had some, though often a very imperfect, knowledge of the language. Some knowledge of English is possessed by persons —chiefly Christians of northern Mesopotamia—who have visited America or have been educated in American Mission Schools. A few men of business are acquainted with English, but it seems to be much less widely known than French, even where, as at Baghdad, British commercial influence has been predominant.Mesopotamia] POPULATION 13 (6) Population Distribution The population of Mesopotamia has been roughly estimated at 2,238,000; of this number it is calculated that 1,511,000 inhabit Irak, and the remaining 727,000 are distributed in upper Mesopotamia. In Irak probably over 90 per cent, of the popula tion is grouped along the rivers and canals. The rural population is on the whole densest in the follow ing areas : (i) along the Shatt el-Arab; (ii) along and near the Euphrates, especially between Museyib and Diwaniya on the Hilla branch or Kufa on the Hindie branch, and again in the Nasrie—Suk esh-Sheynkh area; (iii) on and near the Shatt el-Hai; (iv) to the north and north-east of Baghdad, along the Tigris, and in the country watered by the Khalis—Tawila canal between the Tigris and the Diala and in the Bakuba district; (v) in the country around Amara on the lower Tigris. The neighbourhood of the Euphrates is, owing to natural conditions, far more densely inhabited than that of the Tigris. The number of pure nomads whose movements are confined to Irak is very small, but the desert south and west of the Euphrates is visited by tribes from the Nejd and elsewhere at certain seasons of the year, and in Irak itself a proportion of the inhabitants still keep to a ^semi-nomadic' life. In the plains of upper Mesopotamia the sparse population is distributed chiefly in the following areas: (i) parts of the middle Euphrates valley, which in the past forty or fifty years has been gradually re covering a settled population, after being nearly emptied by anarchy; (ii) between the rivers on the north-western and northern sides of the plain; (iii') between the rivers, in the Jebel Sin jar and the country at the foot of that rane^e to south and east; (iv) east of the Tigris, in the Mosul—Erbil plains and south wards to the Lesser Zab; also at various points under14 GEOGRAPHY [No. 92 the Kurdish foothills from Altun Keupri down to Kifri. Both in the plains and the hill-country of upper Mesopotamia nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes cir culate on their yearly rounds. Towns The position of the chief town of Irak, Baghdad (200,000), 1 is eminently favourable to the existence ot a great city. On Baghdad converge naturally, in con formity with physical features, all the lines of com munication which enter Irak from the north-west, the north, and the north-east; to the south there is easy communication with the thickly-populated Kerbela Hilla region; and lastly there is the waterway of the Tigris leading from the Persian Gulf, and navigable up to Baghdad by river steamers. For its food sup plies Baghdad can draw easily both on the Euphrates to the south and on the Bakuba—Khalis canal area to the north. Basra (80,000) is the port at the southern gate ol Mesopotamia; ocean-going steamers can ascend to it by the Shatt el-Arab. Kerbela and Nejef (50,000 and 40,000) are pilgrim-centres which attract Shiahs from all parts of the Mohammedan world, but chiefly from Persia and India : Nejef is also the starting-point of a pilgrim-route to Mecca, and both Kerbela and Nejef, situated on the edge of the Arabian desert, are markets for the Bedouin. Samarra (3,000) is a place of pilgrimage for Shiahs, but much less important than Kerbela and Nejef. Of the other towns, some are markets along the Euphrates, Tigris, or Shatt el-Hai, the centres of fertile districts, or situated at the junc tion or diverging-point of waterways; others are strung along the great Baghdad—Kermanshah road ; and others are in oases. 1 The figures given for the population of towns must be taken as guesses, giving perhaps some rough indication of their size; they may often be wide of the truth by some thousands.Menopotamial POPULATION 15 The towns of upper Mesopotamia are markets and administrative centres, and support some small trades and industries. There is a group of towns lying on that caravan- route from Aleppo to Mosul which has avoided the open plaims and the southern end of the Karaja Dagb country as too insecure and too waterless, and has gone north by Diarbekr. These towns are Birijik (7.000), [Jrfa (30,000), Diarbekr (40,000), Mardin (30,000), Nisibin (5.000), and Jezire ibn Omar (5,000). Mosul (70,000) not only lies on the trade route between Diarbekr and Baghdad, but is the chief collecting and distributing centre for the commerce with central Kurdistan. Bashkala (5,000) lies on the Van—Urmia caravan-route, and its position as a meeting-point of local tracks made it an important military post from which the tribes were watched. Amadia (3,000), on the southern edge of central Kurdistan, is a trading centre for the Hakkiari country. In southern Kurdistan, Rowanduz (5,000) lies on a caravan route from Mosul to Tabriz, but the roads are bad, and the trade is declining. Suleimanie (12,000) is the chief market of southern Kurdistan, and has a commercial connection with Baghdad and Mosul. On the ed^re of the hills, Erbil (6,000), Altun Ken- pri (3,000), Kirkuk (20,000), Tuz Khurmatli (1,200), and Kifri, or Salahie (4.000). lie along the Mosul— Baghdad road, and from them routes branch east wards to the hill-towns. On the Tigris. Tekrit (5.000) lives mainly by the down-stream raft traffic from Mosul to Baghdad. Lastlv, there are the towns in the middle Euphrates valley below Birijik: Deir ez-Zor (12.000) and Ana (15.000). They live partly by their position on the valley road from Aleppo to Baghdad and on the water-way of the Euphrates. Thev arc also centres of contact with the Bedouin. Deir ez-Zor holds a very important position. Not only is it near theGEOGRAPHY ;No. 92 mouth of the Khabur, but the Syrian desert to west of it, and the Jezireh to east, being less arid here than farther south, are traversed by caravan-routes, from Deir to Damascus on the one hand, and from Deir to Mosul on the other. M ovement As there are no statistics of births, deaths, or migration, nothing definite can be said about any change in the total number of the population. On the whole, it seems to have been growing slowly in the years preceding the European War, but the increase in some districts had been at least partly counter balanced by a decrease (generally due to disorder) in others. There was a tendency among the nomadic popula tion to settle down and take to cultivation. The Turkish Government tried to encourage this tendency, but also in some degree checked it by failing to create confidence or to give adequate protection against disorder.Mesopotamia] II.

(1) Introduction Isaiah , writing of Mesopotamia, speaks ot the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excel lency/' 1 A recent report describes the same region as ' a miserable wilderness of barren desert, alternating with vast swamps.' 2 Such is the change that has been wrought in the course of time. The natural resources of the land in early ages brought wealth to its inhabi tants, and led to the development of civilisation in the verv dawn of history. For about two thousand years before, and nearly three thousand years after Ham murabi made Babylon the capital ot his empire (about 2200 B.C.) Mesopotamia was a centre of dominion and civilising influence. The great powers of the ancient world, Sumerian, Assyrian. Babylonian, obtained their riches and extended their sway from the land of the two rivers, which has been considered one of the four earthly paradises. In 539 b.c. Cyrus the Great conquered Mesopotamia, and incorporated it in the Persian Empire. Neither Achaemenian, Macedonian, nor Seleucid rule affected the general prosperity of the country ; a large popula tion continued to flourish; huge canals and dykes were kept in repair ; and the crops yielded ' for the most part two-hundredfold, and at the best even three- hundredfold.' 3 Babylon continued to be the greatest city in the world until the death of Alexander the Great, when Seleucia, on the Tigris, became the centre of Hellenistic civilisation in the Seleucid Empire and 1 Isaiah, ch. xiii. 1 Brigadier-General Sir G. Buchanan's Beport, 1917. 1 Herodotus, I, 103.Mesopotamia J INTRODUCTION 19 the greatest commercial city of the East. Ctesiphon, on the opposite bank of the Tigris, was the residence of the Parthian Arsacids, and continued under the Sasa- nian dynasty of Persia to be the royal capital. For seven centuries Rome fought Parthia and Persia for the possession of this coveted land; there were con stant changes of frontier; but from the second century a.d , the north was more or less continuously held by the Romans and the south by the Persians under the Sasanian Kings. Subsequent efforts by the Romans to extend their conquests, particularly under the Emperor Julian in 363 a.d . and under Heraclius between 624 and 627 a.d ., produced no permanent alteration in the status quo. The rise of Islam was responsible for the next change of rule in Mesopotamia. In 628 a.d . Mohammed called upon the Persian King to embrace the new religion or prepare for war; various causes combined.to postpone the campaign, but-in 636 the Moslems defeated the Persians in the Battle of Kadisiyah. and proceeded to occupy the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris. The Arabs eventually extended their conquests to the Taurus Mountains. The physical conditions of Mesopotamia have altered considerably at different periods. Eridu, the prin cipal seaport of the Sumerians, was 130 miles from the present coast-line; and in • Babylonian times the Euphrates and Tigris reached the sea as separate rivers. The alluvial area that now stretches from Beled, north of Baghdad, to the head of the Gulf has been formed by deposits of silt, and is said to increase at the rate of about 72 ft. per annum. Changes have also taken place in the courses of the rivers as the result of floods and the formation or decay of different canal systems. About the year 629 a.d . great floods burst the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris: in snifp of the efforts of the Sasanian King to reclaim the land, the swamps thus formed became permanent, and in the ensuing years of warfare the irrigation works fell into disrepair. [2R5—66 ] C 220 HISTORY [No. 92 During tli6 rulo ot tlic Orthodox and Oiii &lt;iV }iid Caliphs, Mesopotamia was a province of the Arabian Empire. Kufa and liasra were founded as Arab strongholds in 037 a.d ., and the country was ruled by governors appointed by the Caliphs. It was on the fall of the Omayyads in 749 that the hegemony passed from Syria to Irak. I he Abbasid Caliphs bestowed great care on the irrigation system of the country, and under their rule its ancient prosperity was renewed. In 762 the Caliph Mansur founded Baghdad, which rioon rose to a position of eminence and became un rivalled for splendour throughout Western Asia. Northern Mesopotamia paid liarun-al-Rashid as gieat a revenue as did Egypt, and its cotton commanded the market of the world.' The seat of government was tern - porarily removed in 886 a.d . to Samarra, and the decline of the Abbasid dynasty set in at about that time. - The Caliphs were then dominated by their Tur kish guard, and Turkish soldiery became the chief power in the country. About the year 1005 a.d . several petty States arose'in Mesopotamia; but, in spite of wars and disturbances, Baghdad remained until the Mongol invasions ' the metropolis of Islam and the centre of learning and culture.' 1 Early in the thirteenth century a vast confederation of Mongolian nomad clans was formed in Central Asia. These swept westward,* spreading ruin and devasta tion; the Persian principalities were overthrown; a huge horde under Hulaku Khan invaded Irak, and in 1258 captured Basrhdad. The city was sacked and burnt; the inhabitants were massacred; the whole system of irrigation was ruined. A second invasion under Tamerlane in the fourteenth century com pleted the depopulation of the country; and for the next two hundred years Mesopotamia practically dis appears from history. In the reign of Sultan Suleiman I (1520-66) the Ottoman Turks engaged in several wars against the 1 Browne. T.itcrnry Hisinrij. of Prrftia, p. 211.Meeopotamia] INTRODUCTION 2J Persians. Erivan, Van, Mosul, and Baghdad were added to the Turkish Empire; and the ligris and Euphrates became the boundary between Turkish and Persian dominions. In 1603 Shah Abbas of Persia conquered the greater part of Mesopotamia; and twenty years later the Persians occupied Baghdad. In 1638 Sultan Murad IV undertook an expedition for the recapture of the city, which was effected in Decem ber of that year, after a siege of some weeks. In the massacre that ensued almost the whole Persian garri son and 30,000 of the inhabitants are said to have perished. A strong Turkish force was left in Bagh dad, which remained from that date until 1917 con tinuously in Turkish hands. (2) E arly Period of Turkish Occupation, 1638-1834 Since its occupation by the Turks, Mesopotamia may be said to be without a history. This, however, is no matter for congratulation; rather it is a case of ' ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.' For two cen turies after the fall of Baghdad affairs in Europe commanded the attention and the resources of the Otto man Empire; and the government of Mesopotamia was relegated to the Pashas of Baghdad and Basra, who were supported by a force of Janissaries, and were generally, until 1834, appointed by the Sultan from the ruling families of the country. In the year 1639 a ' permanent peace was signed between Turkey and Persia, and the common frontier was defined in general terms. This did not entirely put an end to friction between the two nations; the aggressive policy of Nadir Shah led in 1730, to a war which continued intermittently until 1746 (when the treaty of 1639 was reaffirmed); and on two separate- occasions the Persians were in occupation of Basra for a series of years. On the whole, however, neither Turks nor Persians were capable of sustained effort on this frontier.22 111S T OK V [No. 92 The iniiueiice of European Powers began to be felt in Mesopotamia during this period. Hie Portuguese, through their position in the Gulf, were able to assert themselves occasionally at Basra ; but b\ 175/ the} i&lt;u disappeared entirely from Turkish Irak. Ihe DuU i had for many years a Residency at Basra, but it was withdrawn about 1752, and they never again estab lished themselves in the country. In 1638 a r rencn Carmelite was appointed the first Latin Bishop of Babvlon, and in 1679 Louis XI \ by a decree appointed the Superior of the Carmelites at Basra to be voc officio French Consul there. About 1740 the office of Bishop of Babylon was combined with that of French Consul at Baghdad; and the double duties appear to have been discharged by a succession oi bishops until 1 In 1796-97 a French political mission visited Baghdad and a ' Commissioner for Commercial Relations was appointed to act as French Consul there. No Euro pean Power, however, possessed interests at this time in Mesopotamia in any way comparable with those of Great Britain. British intercourse with Mesopotamia arose from the dealings of the East India Company's servants with the local Government. The Company established a factory at Basra in 1639 ; and the agent stationed there to protect commercial interests came to occupy the position of British Resident, and to acquire consider able influence over the local authorities. In 1/98 a British Residency was permanently established at Baghdad; and in 1802 the Resident was formally recognised by the Sultan. After its capture by the Turks in 1638, Baghdad contained only 14,000 inhabitants, and its trade suf fered considerably from the massacre of many ot the richest merchants. Basra at this time formed a separate Pashalik. the possession of which was fre quently disputed by the Arabs and Persians, both oi whom occupied the city at different times for periods varying from a few months to several years. The ravages of plague and flood, which the AdministrationMesopotamiuj KAHLY PEKIOD - 23 was unable to combat, increased the disorganisation and anarchy occasioned by the rebellious tribes in Mesopotamia, and aggravated, by the war with Persia, the aggressions of the Chaab tribe in the south, and the tear of invasion by the Wahabis from Central Arabia. By 1834 the population of the Pashalik of Baghdad had 'decreased almost beyond belief;' 1 the cultiva tion had 'more than proportionately diminished;' 1 and almost every vestige of the ancient prosperity of the country had disappeared. (3) Later Period of Turkish Occupation, 1834-1914 Between 1834 and 1914 increasing attention was directed towards Mesopotamia, both by the Central Government at the Porte and by the Great Powers ol Europe. This interest, however, was aroused less by the condition of the country than by its relation to questions of international importance, and may be attributed chiefly to the changed attitude of the Porte towards provincial administration, to the prominence of the Turko-Persian boundary negotiations, and to the development of British interests in the country, com bined with a growing connection between Mesopotamia and India, which incited other Powers to rivalry with Great Britain. (a) Relations with Persia Conditions in Mesopotamia during this period were adversely affected by the disturbances in the Persian frontier districts. The line of boundary was the chief poilit in dispute; but the territorial question was com plicated by religious considerations. The hostility between Shiah and Sunni Mohammedans became in vested with a political character, and was aggravated by the attitude of the Turkish authorities towards Persians in Turkish territory, particularly the 1 Memoir of Mr. Fraser. Malet's Precis, Appendix E.24 history [No. 92 pilgrims to Kerbelct and Nejel, the Holy C ities ot tlie Shiahs. The destruction of Muhammera by the Turks in 1837. combined with the Persian occupation of the district of Zohab, brought matters to a crisis, and a request was made for the mediation of Great Britain and Russia. Under their auspices a con ference between Turkish and Persian representatives was held at Erzerum in 1843; and in 1847 the Treaty of Erzerum was signed, providing for the determina tion Of the frontier by a Turko-Persian Commission, including British and Russian delegates. After many delays and obstructions, an identic map was submitted in 1869 to the Ottoman and Persian Governments, re presenting a zone of country from 20 to 40 miles broad, within the limits of which it was stated that the boun dary lay. A special Commission was appointed for the demarcation of the frontier within this zone, but their efforts towards a settlement were unsuccessful. In 1905 the situation became disturbing owing to the advances by Turkish troops east of the zone in which the frontier was said to lie. The l urks appeared to covet all territory occupied by Sunnis, and induced many tribes in Persian territory to claim Turkish nationality, with the result that whole districts were in a state of anarchy. Turkish aggressions continued; but Great Britain and Russia finally succeeded in se curing the signature, on November 17, 1913, of a Pro tocol, to which they, as well as Turkey and Persia, were parties, laying down the general line of frontier, and giving specific directions for the settlement of certain details by a Delimitation Commission. The British and Russian delegates on this Commission were em powered not merely to mediate but to arbitrate in cases of dispute between their Turkish and Persian col leagues. Tn September 1914 the demarcation of the frontier by this Commission was completed. (b) British Influence The period from 1834-1914 was remarkable for a great expansion of British interests in Mesopotamia,Mesopotamia] BRITISH INFLUENCE 25 together with increased ditticulty in protecting them. This difficulty arose ' partly from the iiievitublfc multiplication ot points of contact and friction; partly from the bureaucratic influence of Con stantinople in Baghdad affairs; and partly from the overween ing and chauvinistically Turkish spirit of the Pashas now posted to Baghdad by the central authorities.'' 1 The part played by Great Britain in the Turko-Persian boundary disputes tended to increase her influence, but not to improve ber relations with the Turkish authori ties. The latter, however, continued, as before, to appeal for British assistance in difficulties; at the beginning of the Crimean War there appeared a pro bability that Persia might join Russia against Turkey, but the despatch of two British warships to Basra had a tranquillising effect not only upon Persia but also upon certain rebellious Arab tribes in 1 urkish terri tory. 2 British official activity was further extended by the influx of British Indians into the Holy Cities in con sequence of the Oudh Bequest. I his instrument , agreed on by the King of Oudh and the Governor- General of India in 1825, came into operation in 1849. and provided for the monthly payment of sums amount ing to £10,000 a year to Shiahs'at Kerbek and Nejef Owing to complaints that the funds were being mis appropriated to political or personal ends, the Bequest was in 1852 made payable from the Baghdad Treasury, and the British Resident came to exercise a certain supervision over the expenditure. The development of British and British-Indian trade in Mesopotamia, the navigation by British vessels of Mesopotamian waters, and the measures taken for the suppression of piracy and the protection of traffic on the Shatt el-Arab gave to the British Government ' a paramount local influence.' This was strengthened by the institution, in 1^62, of a British mail service 1 Lorimer's Gazetteer, p. 188G. 2 Ibid., p. 1385. 3 Reported by Colonel Eawlinson in 1852.HISTORY [No. 02 between Irak and India and the construction by British agency of lines of telegraph from Baghdad to India, Constantinople, and Teheran. In the latter part oi the century, however, the development of British com merce and influence, together with the emphasising oi British protection over the Sheikhs of Koweit and Muhammera, aroused considerable hostility on the part of the Turkish authorities. This attitude became increasingly pronounced with the growth of German influence at Tonstantinople. (c) Influence, of other Euro peon Powers Until 1881 the only European Power represented at Baghdad besides Great Britain was France, who had no local interests except such as were connected with the Roman Catholic religious orders. Russia obtained a certain influence through her mediation in the Turko- Persian frontier disputes; and it was believed that the Russian Government kept themselves informed of affairs in Irak through Armenian agents. A Russian Consulate was created at Baghdad in 1881, and was raised in 1901 to a Consulate-General. The purpose of this step was political, as the material interests of Russia in Irak were small. Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the United States of America each acquired certain commercial interests in the country, and established Consulates at Baghdad. During the reign of the Sultan Abdul Hamid, Germany was the only foreign country maintaining constant good rela tions with Turkey. ' The beginning of modern German interest in Ottoman affairs may be traced in the writing's of List, von Moltke. and others ; and when Bis marck had in some measure secured the maintenance of Germany's position in Europe he allowed the rising stream of commercial prosperity to follow its own course. This resulted in the eighties and nineties in the Drang nack Osten, which took more definite shape in 1898 on the occasion of the Emperor's visit to Con stantinople. Thenceforth Germany's influence wasMesopotamiaj .K L .HO PE 1 N t L L 1 ii N ( K Ti directed towards the furtherance of her designs in the Near East and the obstruction of British develop ment. Her endeavours in this direction were crowned with success by the Baghdad Railway Convention of 1903. German influence received a check by the advent to power, in 1908, of the Young Turkish party, whose sympathies, it was hoped, might be with Great Britain; but the conflict of British and Turkish aims in Mesopotamia combined with other causes to make this expectation short-lived. ' On the other hand, the steady penetration of Turkish commerce by Germany; the calculated' abstention in German publications and speeches from any comment or criticism on the unconstitutional methods employed by the Turkish Government; the idea, which undoubtedly obtained, that Ger many was not ' suspect ' as regard's Turkish territory, and that her projects in Asia Minor were commercial and not territorial; and the sale of cruisers to 1 urkey at a time of crisis —all contributed powerfully, it would appear, to cause the Turks to lean towards Germany. '' 1 Between 1889 and 1912 German trade in Turkey increased tenfold, but the real purpose of such com mercial penetration is demonstrated by Dr. Rohrbach, who stated in his w T ork Die Bagdadhahn in 1911 : ' All economic measures we may take in Turkey are only a means to an end, not an end in themselves ; and went on to show that the end was the establishment oi German political ascendancy from the North Sea to the Indian Ocean (d) Internal Conditions The mam principle of the internal administration of Mesopotamia in this period was the suppression of every kind of influence that competed with the authority of the Porte. Until 1834 the government of the province rested with the Pasha; the Sultan was regarded rather in the light of suzerain than of ruler, and his authority in Irak was constantly defied. Tn ''The Baghdad Railway Negotiations,' Quarterly Review, October 1917.2b HIS TOR V' [No. 96 18^4, however, attempts were made to centralise the administration of the Empire, and to substitute direct control by the Porte for the semi-independent rule ot the Pashas. The latter were no longer to be selected from local families, but were despatched to the pro vince from Constantinople. The efforts of these governors to fill the public purse by a stricter collection of the revenues aroused dissatisfaction among the Arabs; and rebellions were of frequent occurrence. Midhat Pasha, who had reorganized the civil administration of the Empire in 1867, was sent Baghdad in 1869 to introduce the vilayet system ot government. He caused considerable concern to the British authorities by his efforts to extend Turkisl sovereignty along the coast of the Persian Gull. Lne policy of centralisation in Mesopotamia was continued by the Sultan Abdul Hamid, during whose reign the Turkish administration became, on the whole, more effective The Turkish Revolution of 1908 was wel comed by the majority of the population; but the chauvinist policy of the Young Turks disappointed the hopes that had been entertained. The state of anarchy on the Persian frontier exercised a disturbing in fluence; disaffection among the Arabs was prevalent; and down to 1914 there was general disorder and insecurity throughout Mesopotamia. (4) Commercial Development Many enterprises, apparently exclusively co 1 ™ 61 *' cial, have subsequently proved to be of the highest political importance. This is pre-eminently true m Mesopotamia, whether such enterprise has been under taken for the advancement of purely commercial in terests without ulterior motive, as exemplified by the history of British navigation of Mesopotamian waters, or whether, as in the case of the Baghdad Railway, strategic and political aims have been (leliberateiy dis guised as commercial projects. n {a) Navigation—British intercourse with MesopoMeBopotamia ] NAVIGATION 20 tamia was begun by the ships of the East India Company in the early part of the seventeenth century; the continued navigation by British vessels of Meso potamia n waters has been responsible for the develop ment of British trade and influence, for the measure of improvement eft'ected in the economic condition oi the country, and, in a large degree, for whatever has been accomplished in the way of the suppression of lawless ness and the establishment of security of traffic. In 1639 the East India Company made their lirst attempt to trade with Basra; and Bntish ships navi gated the Tigris and Euphrates throughout the eighteenth century. No opposition on the part of the local authorities is recorded; on the contrary, the assist ance of the Company's warships was frequently sought and obtained by the Pasha of Baghdad in his opera tions against Arabs and Persians. From 1820 or earlier Government vessels, under the British flag, were attached to the British Residency at Baghdad; and in 1840, after Colonel Chesney's expedition' to Mesopo tamia, a British armed flotilla of four vessels was formed for use on the Tigris and Euphrates. Under the command of Lieutenant Lynch, of the Indian Navy, this flotilla navigated and surveyed the rivers, assisted in maintaining order, and regularly carried the British mails up the Tigris to Baghdad. 2 For many years previously. British merchant vessels, under the British flag, had plied be tween Basra and Baghdad; and an agreement exe cuted by the Pasha in 1823 3 indicates that the usage 1 1835-37. This expedition was undertaken for the purpose of surveying the route, in order to test whether steam navigation could be established via the Euphrates for the conveyance of the Indian mails from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. 2 Three of the vessels were withdrawn in 1842, but the remain ing steamer continued to carry on its duties as before without restrictions. 3 This agreement stated that ' no tax, except one previously well defined and arranged, should be levied on boats the property of British subjects or prot^g^s; such, for instance, as pass between Basra and Baghdad.'30 HISTORY iNo. 92 was recognised by the Ottoman Government. From 1842, however, the Turkish authorities showed a dis position to curtail the privileges hitherto enjoyed by British merchant ships; and constant disputes arose over the illegal exaction of transit duties. An agree ment was therefore concluded in 1846 between Great Britain and the Porte formally recognising the right of British vessels to navigate Mesopotamian waters. In 1861 Messrs. Lynch Brothers formed the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, whose first steamer was placed on the Tigris in the fol lowing year. All attempts to extend or facilitate British commercial navigation in Mesopotamia met, however, with constant opposition from the Turkish authorities. In 1867 a line of steamers was con stituted under the Turkish flag and under official direction, and from the time of Midhat Pasha's rule at Baghdad these steamers were used almost exclusively for commercial purposes, with the object of driving the British boats off the river. In soite of the resulting competition, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company continued to carry the British mails, to develop trade, and to extend British influence in Meso potamia. From 1907 a fusion of this Company with the Turkish Government Company was projected, but negotiations were abandoned in 1910. The Porte then declared that the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates would be thrown open to Otto man subiects only; and various permits were issued, to which His Majesty's Govefrnment took exception as encouraging unfair competition in view of the restric tions imposed upon the British Company. As the sreneral position was far from satisfactorv, it was insisted, in the negotiations between the British ;ind Ottoman Governments which resulted in the De^lnration sioned at London Jnlv 29. 1918, that the rights enjoyed by Lynch Br others should be specified in express terms and in treaty form, and be recosrnised as permanent. It was also arranged that all other commercial navigation by steamships should be theMesopotamia] -NAVIGATION 31 monopoly of a new Ottoman Company, with a British chairman recommended by the British Government. 1 An Anglo-Turkish Convention was also signed at London on July 29, 1913, for the establishment of a Commission to improve the conditions of navigation on the Shatt el-Arab. This river maxks the boundary between Turkey and Persia, the whole waterway being de jure within Turkish limits; the Sheikh oi Muhammera has always exercised a de facto jurisdic tion on its waters; and by the Treaty of Erzerum in 1847 Persian ships were guaranteed freedom of navi gation. The approaches and upper reaches of the river have been charted and periodically surveyed by British agency, which has also been responsible for the maintenance of buoys to mark tiie channel across the bar. In 1912, 90 per cent, of the ocean-going vessels were British; Germany was represented by 12 steam ships, Russia by 5, and France by 1. The proposed Commission was to consist of two members, one oi whom should be British; the engineer-in-chief and the inspector of the river were also to be of British nation ality. The Shatt el-Arab was to remain open to the vessels of all nations on terms of equality; no dues were to be levied for navigation, but only in payment of services rendered. The terms of the Convention met with no opposition on the part of the interested Powers, whose acouiescence was obtained. {h) Railway Communication. —At the time of Colonel Chesney's expedition to Mesopotamia the ques tion'of railway communication between the Mediter ranean and the Persian Gulf was much discussed in England. The Euphrates Valley Railwav Company was formed in 1856, and obtained in the following year general concession for the construction of a railway between Suedia (Alexandretta) and Basra. Without a guarantee, however, which neither the Imperial nor the Indian Government felt justified in giving, British canitalists hesitated to support the enterprise, and no further steps were taken; though the acquisition o1 1 For detflils nf this agrefttnent-, see below, p. 100.32 HISTORY No. 92 Cyprus in 1878 was motived in part by its nearness to the proposed line of the railway. In the latter part ot the nineteenth century JBritish influence with the Poite declined; and Germany seized the opportunity to make a bid for political expansion under the guise of econo mic development in Asiatic Turkey. Ln 1888, when direct railway communication was established between Berlin and Constantinople, a German syndicate secured valuable railway concessions in Asia Minor; and in consequence the Anatolian Railway Company was constituted. Further concessions were granted in 1893; and in 1899 a Convention was signed conceding in principle rights subsequently defined by the Bagh dad Railway Convention of 1903. By this Convention the Ottoman Government granted to the Anatolian Railway Company 1 a concession for the prolongation to Baghdad and Basra of their existing line. Provision was made for certain branch lines, including one to a l &gt;oint on the Persian Gulf to be subsequently deter- mined. The Company was to be allowed to work all minerals found within' 20 kilometres on either side of the line, to establish ports on the Persian Gulf, and to navigate the rivers in the service of the railway. Further, it was stipulated that no section of the line between Baghdad and Basra might be worked before the completion of the main line from Koma to Bagh dad. from which it appears that the economic develop ment of Mesopotamia was of secondary importance to the linking ud of Constantinople (and thereby Berlin) with the Middle East. 2 German proposals for British participation in this concession were not such as to find acceptance. Tn 1911 the right to continue the line from Baghdad to the Gulf was surrendered to a suit able Ottoman Company, but with the reservation that 1 It was provided that the Anatolian Company should form an Ottoman Joint Stock Company, under the title of the Imperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company, which should take the place of the Anatolian Company in all that concerned the new line from Konia to the Persian Gulf. , , , „ -i 2 For the financial arrangements of the Baghdad Railway Con vention, see below, p. 63.Meaopotamiaj RAILWAYS 33 the Baghdad Railway Company should participate therein to an extent not less than any non-Turkish element; the possibility of British predominance in this section of the line was thus eliminated. In 1912, after prolonged negotiations, His Majesty's Government in timated to the Ottoman Government that they were prepared to withdraw their request for British partici pation in the Gulf sections of the Baghdad Railway, and would agree to an increase in the Turkish Customs if certain specific points at issue could be satisfac torily settled. An arrangement was concluded with the Ottoman Government in 1913, which stipulated, inter alia, that— {a) There should be no differential treatment on any railway in Asiatic Turkey. {h) Two British representatives, approved by His Majesty's Government, should be admitted to the Board of the Baghdad Railway Company. (c) The terminus of the Baghdad Railway should be at Basra. {d) No railway should be constructed from Basra to the Gulf without the sanction of His Majesty's Government. Both Great Britain and Germany pledged themselves to endeavour to secure that these provisions should be carried into effect, and further arranged that the con struction and exploitation of ports at Basra and Baghdad, authorised by the Convention of 1903, should he carried out by a separate Ottoman Ports Company. The German Government agreed not to oppose the ac quisition by British interests of 40 per cent, of the share capital of this Ports Company. In return, the Baghdad Railway Company were granted a certain participation in the new Ottoman Company for River Navigation. The Anglo-German Agreement was initialled in London on June 15, 1914, but its ratifica tion depended upon the conclusion of the negotiations between Germany and Turkey, which had not been effected on the outbreak of the European war. [285—66] D34 HISTORY fNo. 92 (c) Oil Concessions. 1 —A German expert, who in 1901 visited the oil-bearing districts of Mosul and Baghdad, reported that ' these petroleum regions are among the richest in the world,'' and subsequent re ports tend to confirm this view. The concession of these oil wells was granted by firmans in 1889 and 1898 to the Turkish Civil List, transferred in 1908-9 to the Ministry of Finance, and has since been the property of that Department. In consequence of a provision in the Baghdad Rail way Convention of 1903. an agreement was signed in 1904 between the Anatolian Railway Company and the Civil List for working certain mines in Mosul and Baghdad, the option for which was to be open for two years. At the end of that time the Civil List invited a German syndicate to take up the option, but the offer was declined. A British subject, Mr. D'Arcy, who had consider able oil interests in Persia, started negotiations at .Constantinople in 1902 with a view to acquiring the oilfields of the two vilayets, and received from two Grand Viziers the promise that the concession would be transferred to him. From 1912 onwards attempts were made to effect a fusion of British and German interests, and an agreement was drawn up in 1914. In pursuance of this agreement, a company was incor porated in Great Britain under the name of tha Turkish Petroleum Company, Limited; and the British and German Ambassadors at Constantinople were in formed that the Porte agreed to lease to the company the oilfields in the vilayets of Mosul and Baghdad. No definite settlement as to the terms of the lease was reached before the outbreak of the European war; and in November 1915 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, re presenting Mr. D'Arcy's interests, were informed that the agreement no longer possessed legal validity. 1 The oil-belts of MesopotamiH are described below, p.Mesopotamia i III. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS (1) Religious Throughout the Ottoman Empire the State religion is Mohammedanism; and since 1517, when Selim I in duced the Caliph Mutawakkil to transfer the Caliphate to the Ottoman Sultan and his successors, the Sultan has claimed the position of spiritual head of all orthodox Moslems. The phrase 'spiritual sovereignty,' as applied to the Sultan, is debatable, for, while his executive and judiciary powers are unlimited, he has never possessed 'legislation.' For the Moslem,'legis lation ' means merely the interpretation of the divine law itself by the l ulama. It is, therefore, difficult to say in what the authority of the Sultan over Islamic populations resident in non-Turkish countries con sists. 1 In Mesopotamia, the home of the Abbasid Caliphs and early stronghold of Islam, Moham medans constitute an overwhelming majority, and are reckoned to outnumber the adherents of other creeds in the ratio of 10 to 1. Religion in Mesopotamia is for the most part a question of race; with few excep tions, all Arabs, Kurds, Turks, and Persians are Mussulmans; all Armenians and Syrians are Chris tians; and Jews, Yezidis, Sabians, and Chabaks have their own distinctive relisrions. The Koran shows little tolerance for non-Mussulmans; and, although the law of the Tanzimat (1889) and the Hatt-i-Humayun of 1856 guaranteed freedom of religious worship and per fect equality among all Ottoman subjects, 3 the provi- 1 See Nalliuo, C.

[285—66] D 236 PRESENT CONDITIONS [No. 92 sions of these laws were frequently disregarded, and the Koran continued to be both the religious and civil code. In Mesopotamia, however, there appears to have been little persecution; and it has been reported that in Baghdad the Christian and the Jew enjoyed a ' rare freedom in comparison with other Mohammedan towns.' 1 Notorious Moslem outrages against Chris tians have occurred in the north, as a rule by the agency of the Kurds; but on the whole the animosity between the two chief Mohammedan sects, the Sunnis and the Shiahs, is more marked than that between Moslems and non -Moslems. The Turks and Turkomans, the Kurds, and the Arabs of the Jezireh are Sunnis, and are estimated at 1.037,000 persons; the Persians and most of the Arabs of Irak are Shiahs, and are calculated to number about 1.173,000. The political significance of this cleavage is emphasised by the refusal of the Shiahs to recognise the Sultan as Caliph. Further, since the Shiah doctrine is the national creed of Persia, the religious bond between Shiahs in Persia and Mesopotamia is fre quently a cause of serious embarrassment to the Turkish authorities. Feeling between the two sects runs particularly high at the time of the pilgrimages, and in the neighbourhood of the Holy Cities. The principal Shiah shrines are at Nejef, Kerbela, and Kazimain; there is a great influx of pilgrims to these places, particularly during the winter months, from Persia. India, and other Mohammedan countries. The numbers nre believed to amount to 150,000—200,000 in the rear. The Mujtahids. or chief men of the sect, exercise considerable influence, both religious and poli tical. The Mujtahids of Nejef and Kerbela have authority superior to that of any other Mujtahids throughout the entire Shiah world. The most important Sunni shrine in Mesopotamia is at Baghdad, and is the resort of pilgrims from regions 1 Memoir hij Com mondcr FcUx Jonfis, p. 339.

The Nakib of Baghdad, the hereditary custodian of the shrine and official head of the Arab community in the city, has a widespread influence among his co-religionists. The Christian sects in Mesopotamia may be divided into three groups: (1) the independent Asiatic Churches; (2) the Uniates, in communion with the Koman Catholic Church; (3) the Protestant communi ties. The most important of these religious bodies have at various times obtained the recognition of the Turkish Government, and have been constituted as authorised communities, or ' millets.' The Turkish Government appointed the spiritual head of theChurch as civil administrator of the millet, and although his functions were considerably reduced as the law of the Turkish Courts became less entirely based upon the Koran, yet the patriarch remained primarily respon sible to the Government for the political control of the millet. The independent Asiatic Churches include the Gre gorian Church of Armenia, the Nestorian or East Syrian, and the West Syrian or Jacobite. The Churches which acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the Pope are the Armenian Uniate, the Chaldean or East Syrian Uniate, and the West Syrian or Jacobite Uniate. Mention should here be made of the connexion between the West Syrian or Jacobite Uniate Church and the ancient Christian community of Southern India, which is a factor of considerable importance in Malabar and Travancore. This community acknow ledges the Patriarch of Antioch as its supreme autho rity; its Bishops are appointed from Syria, and the connexion may be noted as constituting an existing link between Syria and the British Empire. Each com munity has its separate hierarchy, although the Pope exercises some limited power in the appointment of the bishops and patriarchs. Communities of various Roman Catholic religious orders have been established by the Italians and the Erench in northern Meso- potamia and in Baghdad and Basra. The Protestants38 PRESENT CQNDTTIONS [No. 02 in Mesopotamia' are mainly Armenians, but include other converts of the American and Anglican missions. The number of Jews in the country is said to be about 60,000; they are almost exclusively confined to the towns, particularly Baghdad, where they outnumber the Turks and Arabs. The Yezidis, who are estimated to be about 21,000, are chiefly found in the Mosul vilayet. They have suffered much persecution, and are considered by the Moslems and Christians as idolaters. They have no central ecclesiastical autho rity, but a hierarchy of castes and sects. 1 he Chabaks (10,000), the Sabians (2,000), and members of other creeds , are of comparatively slight importance, and carry no political weight in the country. (2) Political The internal administration of Mesopotamia was conducted from 1869 on the vilayet system, which was introduced into the country by Midhat Pasha. Zor, 1 Diarbekr, Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra formed separate vilayets, which were sub-divided into sanjaks and kazas. Each vilayet was governed by a Vali, assisted by an Administrative Council. The Vali of Baghdad took precedence of the other Governors, but each vilayet was placed directly under the central Govern ment at Constantinople. The Yali had no authority over the regular troops in the province, but could call upon their commander for support; attempts at effec tive action were, however, constantly paralysed by the division of authority. In times of peace the mainten ance of law and order depended upon the gendarmerie, who were under the control of the Turkish War Office, but were distributed as military police under the orders of the civil authorities. The Valis had no power to appoint their subordinates, and had no control over the Courts of Justice, the Departments of Land Records, Posts and Telegraphs, Religious Endowments, Cus- 1 Zor was technically a Mutessariflik.Mesopotamia] POLITTCAL 39 tx)ins, Public Debt, the Tobacco and Salt Monopolies, Public Instruction, and Sanitary Service. The local chiefs of these Imperial Departments received their orders direct from Constantinople, an arrangement which had certain advantages, but, owing to the diffi culties of communication, resulted in administrative paralysis. In each vilayet the Vali was the political representa tive of the Ottoman Government, and as such con ducted all dealings with foreign Consular Officers and with the chiefs of the semi-independent tribes. He also controlled the Provincial Departments, of which the most important was that concerned with the col lection of taxes and the keeping of the general accounts. The Turks employed the system of farming the taxes, with the result that bribery and corruption were rife. It has been stated on good authority that in the vilayet of Basra alone, which contained a relatively large settled population, seven-tenths of the people success fully escaped all taxation. The late Sultan, Abdul Hamid, converted into his private property some 30 per cent, of the best cultivated lands in the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad, and con siderable areas in the northern provinces. 1 In 1909 the Young Turkish party transferred these properties from the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance, the management was taken over by the State, and the revenues were expended in the interests of the Com mittee of Union and Progress. (3) Educational The Department of Public Instruction under the Ottoman Government maintained in every sanjak and kaza a primary school, in which Turkish and Arabic- were taught. There were, in addition, a secondary school for boys and a primary school for girls at Baghdad and at Basra. These were all Government 1 See below, p. 86.40 PRESENT CONDITIONS • [No .92 institutions, where instruction was given free of charge. There were also a primary and a secondary military school at Baghdad, and industrial schools at Baghdad and Basra. The Da'irat es-Saniyeh main tained primary schools on some of the rural estates under its control. Religious schools were maintained by the Shiahs at Kerbela, where the Sunnis also had one school. At Baghdad the Jewish, Chaldean, Syrian, and Armenian communities each had a school; in that of the Jews English and French were taught, and the general in struction was said to be excellent. There was also a Jewish school at Basra for boys and girls. The Carmelites, and the nuns who worked in asso ciation with them, had several boys' and girls' schools in Irak. These schools were under French protection ; and the instruction was in Arabic and French, with a little English. En 1906 the German Consul at Bagh dad offered to subsidise liberally the Carmelite schools in the country if they would undertake to teach German. The French Dominicans and nuns at Mosul conducted over a dozen schools in the neighbourhood for boys and girls, and carried on educational work among the Chaldeans and other IJniates. A school for boys and girls was maintained by the Americans at Basra; there were also American schools in northern Mesopotamia. The Church Missionary Society had schools at Baghdad and at Mosul. In spite of this provision for education, it appears to be generally admitted that Moslem instruction in Meso potamia has been negligible, and has been restricted almost entirely to the official classes. The education provided by French, English, and American schools has affected only a small proportion of the town popula tions; and the people as a whole, including all the nomad tribes, are entirely illiterate. The Trade Com missioners reported in 1917 that education was the great need of the country. During the present British occupation thirteen Government primary schools, four municipal State-aided schools, a teachers' trainingMesopotamia] EDUCATIONAL 41 school, and a survey school have been opened. The local demand for education is said 1 to be very in sistent, and is being met as rapidly as the supply of teachers will permit. (4) General Observations (a) Irrigation The question of irrigation is intimately connected with the past prosperity of Lower Mesopotamia, and with its present poverty. The ancient civilisations of Babylonia obtained their wealth from the land, and expended this wealth in constructing vast irrigation works, which obtained for the country the title of ' the granary of the world. The Mongol invasions of the thirteenth and four teenth centuries and the Turkish conquest in 1638 de stroyed the irrigation works, and with them the pros perity of the country and its powers of recuperation. Attempts have occasionally been made by the Ottoman authorities, particularly by Midhat Pasha when Vali of Baghdad, to irrigate the country, but through lack of resources or a strong administration no success was attained. Tn 1909 Sir William Willcocks, as Adviser to the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works, submitted a scheme for the irrigation of 3^ million acres at a total capital cost of 26 million pounds. The first portion of the scheme, including the erection of the Hindie bar rage, was undertaken by the British firm of Sir John Jackson in 1911, and the barrage was formally in augurated in December 1913. Tenders for about a third of the whole scheme were invited by the Ottoman Government in 1912, and submitted by two British firms only. The Ottoman Government, for financial reasons, did not then proceed with the work, but in 1 Statement by Lord Robert Cecil in tlie House of Commons, July 2B, 1918.42 PRESENT ( ONDTTIONS 1 No. 92 1914 arranged with His Majesty's Government that all irrigation works in Mesopotamia, other than those already tendered for, should be put up to open tender. It is held by some competent authorities that the per sistent destruction of forests in the highlands of Armenia by goats, which eat the bark of trees, has materially affected the rainfall of the region in which the Tigris and Euphrates have their sources. On this assumption, the volume of water in the Mesopotamia^ rivers would depend to some extent upon the afforesta tion of Armenia. All schemes, however, for the agricultural develop ment of Mesopotamia, are conditional on, and limited by, the quality and extent of the labour available, not only for the construction of irrigation works and for the excavation of canal systems, but for the upkeep of such works and for the increased demands of culti vation. (b) Lahovr ] • The question of the introduction of the additional labour which is vital to the development of the country presents a serious difficulty. Considerable political and religious difficulties would attend the deliberate introduction of a fresh population from India or elsewhere; and such action would probably create resentment and unrest among the Arabs. It is unlikely that any influx of colonists would be welcome in Mesopotamia unless the newcomers were either Arabs, Asiatic or African, or belonged to races which easily absorb Arab civilisation 2 and would thus adapt themselves to the existing social conditions. Numbers of Lurs have already settled round Baghdad without opposition on the part of the Arab tribes; and im proved conditions in Mesopotamia would doubtless lead Hie economic aspect of this question is dealt with below p. 71. r e.g., the inhabitants of the Sudan or Persia.Mesopotamia] LABOUR 43 to a supply tram the border peoples of useful and acceptable labour. ' Fertility of soil, settled administration, facility of com munications, and last, but not least, the possession of pilgrim centres of great sanctity, are all magnets to attract immigra tion ; and nature may safely be trusted to find means of filling the vacuum if it is proved to exist.' 1 Many of the semi-nomad tribes were at one time settled, and might be induced to become so again. Sir Louis Pelly in 1863 expressed the opinion that even the Bedouin is capable of adapting himself to a changed environment; and the pastoral population under improved conditions would be an important and profitable element in the country. (c) Capital The provision of capital forms the essence of the double problem of restoring Mesopotamia to prosperity and of neutralising foreign competition detrimental to British interests and influence. Almost every country has discovered as a result of the war that there was a political and sinister side to the apparently innocent commercial and industrial enterprise of Germans in its territories; and that the introduction -of German capital and applied science was intended to be made the basis of economic vassalage and, ultimately, of political servitude to Germany. In Turkey, where German trade increased tenfold between 1889 and 1912, and has long been openly fostered as a means to political ascendancy, this policy of commercial pene tration 2 has been especially significant for two reasons —firstly, it has been relatively easy of accomplishment, owing to the temperamental disinclination and ad ministrative inability of the Turks to conduct large commercial enterprises themselves; secondly, it has been openly and widely advocated in Germany as a menace to Great Britain's command of the sea, and as a peril 1 Trade Commissioner 's Report, lV)i7. - This question is dealt with in detail below, p. 101.44 PRESENT CONDITIONS 'No. 92 to her connection with Egypt and the East. A con structive British commercial policy' is the only real antidote to German penetration; and it is not only eminently desirable, but indeed vital, that the timel\ formation should be encouraged of at any rate one reallv powerful British or Anglo-Indian banking syn dicate to compete with similar foreign institutions m those parts of Asiatic Turkey in which British interests centre. (d) Conclusions The ancient prosperity ot Mesopotamia, revived under the Caliphs, was finally destroyed by the Mongol invasions, the eftects of which were peipetuated by the Turko-Persian wars and subsequent years of Turkish misrule. During the whole period ot its inclusion in the Ottoman Empire Mesopotamia suffered from a cor rupt administration, internal strife and rebellion^ in justice and oppression, poverty and want. It appears to be agreed amongst British authorities that the elimination of all Turkish participation in the futuie administration is imperative; a return after the wai to the status quo ante would be fatal to the interests ot the country, and would, moreover, be inconsistent with the pledges given by His Majesty s Government to the Arabs. On December 17, 1915, the Sherit o1 Mecca was given the written assurance that ' Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace in terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from Turkish and German domination does not form an essential condition.' The King of the Hejaz was also informed that His Majesty's Government would ' recognise and support the independence of the Arabs, although as regards Mesopotamia he was warned that ' the established in terests of Great Britain would necessitate special measures of administrative control.' 2 It would be 1 The methods recommended by Sir George Lloyd are described below, p. 107. 2 In a message for King Hussein, dated February 4, 1918, Mr. Balfour reaffirmed former pledges given by His Majesty's Govern ment to the Arabs.Mesopotamia] CONCLUSTONS 45 difficult to reconcile these promises with even nominal suzerainty by the Porte. Should annexation he imprac ticable, the remaining possibilities are the establish ment of a benevolent protectorate or the creation of an independent Arab State. No Power in the world lias any claim comparable with that of Great Britain to control the destinies of Mesopotamia. For over two centuries Great Britain has performed countless services, involving the sacrifice of many lives and the expenditure of much money, in the development of international trade, in the estab lishment of communication by steamship, post and telegraph, in the protection of traffic, and in the sup pression of lawlessness and piracy on the rivers of Mesopotamia, and in the Persian 'Gulf. The conse quently unique position of Great Britain in this region, the peculiar interests—strategic, political, and com mercial—which she has at stake, and the intimate connection between Mesopotamia and India combine to make the future administration of the country a matter of vital concern to the British Empire. More over, the great improvements effected during the present military occupation, the millions of money ex pended upon the port of Basra, the work on the Hindie barrage and canal system, by which 300.000 acres have in 1018 been brought into cultivation, and the friendly relations established between the British authorities and the Arabs 1 , point to continued progress in the future under British auspices. In this connec tion the emphatic words of Sir A. Lawley are worthy of record. 2 ' It is certain that if, in an ill-starred moment when the war draws to an end, we make up our minds to vacate the land, our withdrawal will bo regarded as the betrayal of men whom we have wheedled into allegiance, and will have the worst possible effect on our Mohammedan subjects through out the Empire. Indeed, it may not improbably lead to the crumbling of the whole of our Eastern Imperial edifice 1 Air.

Indeed, T do not know whether from a political or from a purely economic point of view the abandonment of this vast territory would be the greater blunder.' The proclamation issued by the British on their entry into Baghdad in March 19] 7 announced that they came to emancipate the inhabitants of the country from the oppressive rule of the Turks, and to assist them to work out their destiny on more auspicious lines. The people were further invited to come forward and take part in the administration. At this time His Majesty's Government appear to have contemplated that the vilayet of Basra should ' remain permanently under British administration,' 1 and that the Baghdad vilayet should be formed into an Arab State, under British protection in everything but name. British control over the port of Basra and its ap proaches is mOvSt desirable for the safeguarding of British interests in the Gulf; the claim is based upon a long record of services rendered exclusively by British agency, and was in effect recognised in the Ang:lo-Tur- kish negotiations before the war. The establishment of some form of British protectorate over the vilayet of Baghdad would, perhaps, offer the best security for British interests, and would have the most beneficial results upon the country. Should such a policy, how ever, fail to meet with general acceptance, the only alternative is the creation of an independent Arab kingdom, under some veiled form of tutelage, which would fulfil the pledges given to the Arabs, and would also be in accordance with the war aims of the Allies. Hie approximate boundaries which appear desirable for this State are shown in the attached map. The King of the Hejaz has been suggested by some autho rities as the possible head of an Arab Government in Mesopotamia; others, including Sir Percy Cox, have 1 Telegram of March 29, 1917, from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy./ Mesopotamia] CONCLUSIONS 47 proposed the Nakib of Baghdad, who already possesses considerable prestige and influence, both locally and among the Mohammedans of India. In any case, some measure of British supervision would be necessary to enforce authority and effect security, for the Turks have left the country incapable of working out its own political or economic salvation. Mesopotamia as it was in 1914 has been compared to Upper Burma pre vious to its annexation by Great Britain; and there seems no sufficient reason why difficulties which have been overcome in one instance should prove insurmount able in the other. The future of Mesopotamia depends upon some measure of British control, without which the country would be left by the expulsion of the Turks merely a prey to the next aggressor.[No. 92 IV. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (A) MEANS OF COMMUNICATION (1) Internal (a) Roads, Paths, avd Tracks Mesopotamia abounds in tracks, but before the war had very few roads, and those of an indifferent kind, metalled only in small sections. Only upon the trade routes radiating from Mosul and Baghdad was wheeled traffic general, and even upon these much of the trans port was carried on by means of camels, mules, donkeys, and, to some extent, baggage ponies. In Irak or Lower Mesopotamia, when the Tigris and Euphrates are in flood, the roads and tracks are, gener ally speaking, impassable, but this condition of affairs is less serious than might be supposed, because it is at the time of flood that navigation on the rivers and canals is at its best. During the low-water season wheeled traffic can use the roads between Baghdad and Kut, Hilla, Kerbela, and Nejef. Away from the rivers, the main difficulties of move ment are due to the desert and waterless character of most of the country. Though the going is often rough and (after rain) heavy, the ground is usually more or less passable for wheels in the plains and rolling country of the Jezireh, the Syrian Desert, and the area between the Tigris and the mountains on the east. The main routes of Mesopotamia are those used either for trade or by pilgrims visiting the different shrines situated in the Delta, of which the most impor tant are those at Kerbela, Nejef, and Baghdad. TheMesopotamia] ROADS, &amp;c 49 roads can therefore most conveniently be grouped round Baghdad and Mosul, the most important trading centres of the interior. The chief roads round Baghdad are as follows:— (1) Baghdad and Khanikin. —This is the main route for trade to Kermanshah in Persia from the west and south, and is also largely used by pilgrims visiting the shrines of Mesopotamia. The size and importance of the pilgrim traffic on this route may be judged from the fact that in 1905 no less than 95,000 pilgrims paid sani tary taxes to come into Mesopotamia at Khani kin, bringing with them some 8,000 corpses for burial, some 60,000 beasts of burden, and up wards of 10,000 packages of merchandise. All these pilgrims have to return carrying with them merchandise from Baghdad and the holy places. The distance from Baghdad to Khani kin is about 94 miles, and to Kermanshah about 222 miles. The complete journey to Kermanshah takes about twenty days for camels and about fourteen days for horses or mules. In dtr weather the road is suitable for wheeled traffic right into Persia ; in wet weather the sur face becomes in places impossible for wheeled traffic. A motor service was running between Baghdad and Bakuba (about 31 miles) in 1913. (2) Baghdad and Mosvl. —Here there are two routes:— {a) Along the line of the Jebel Hamrin via Kifri, Altun Keupri, and Erbil (293 miles). Though the longer, this is the better and more frequented route, as it is less subject to floods than the lower route along the Tigris Valley, and passes through a well- watered and populous district. The cross ings of the rivers which flow down to the Tigris present difficulties, but this route is generally suitable for wheeled traffic, and the [285—66] ' EECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 93 entire journey has been accomplished in a motor-car. (b) Following the right bank of the ligris, vid Samarra, Tekrit, and Kalaat Sherghat (230 miles). North of Samarra the route was before the war a mere track, not suitable for wheeled traffic. According to a German map recently captured, it is now fit for wheeled traffic for its whole length. (3) Baghdad and Aleppo, via Feluja, Hit, Abu Kemal. Deir ez-Zor, and Meskene. This is a regular route for caravans, which make the journey in from twenty to twenty-five days; a carriage can cover the distance in about fifteen days, and the section between Ana and Aleppo has been traversed by motor-car in 31 hours. The route follows the Euphrates from Feluja to Meskene, at which point it leaves the river and goes west across the plain to Aleppo. (4) Baghdad and Damascus or Horns, following route (3) to Deir ez-Zor and thence proceeding south-west to Tadmur (Palmyra). This is a regular caravan route, both goods and passenger traffic being fairly regular Caravans cross each way every forty or sixty days. The three chief routes round Mosul are as follows (1) ]\IosvJ and Baghdad {see above). (2) Mosul to Rania rid Erbil and Keui Sa.njak, and thence into Persia. This route is suitable for wheeled traffic only as far as Ilania, from which point the route into Persia degenerates into a track. (3) Mosul and Diarhekr, rid Nisibin and Mardin, whence there are good roads leading north to Erzerum and south-west to Aleppo and Alexandretta. Before the war this was the chief route from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia,Mesopotamia] RIVERS AND CANALS 51 (b) Rivers and Canals The important rivers of Mesopotamia are the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the river formed by the confluence of these two at Kurna and known as the Shatt el-Arab. Of less importance are the four tributaries which join the Tigris from the Persian hills on its lett bank, the Great and Lesser Zab, the Adheim between Mosul and Baghdad, and the Diala just below the latter town. The length of the Tigris between Mosul and Kurna is about 723 miles, that of the Euphrates between Meskene and Kurna about 1.002 miles; the length of the Shatt el-Arab is 107 miles. From the economic point of view, the main interest in Mesopotamia centres round the Tigris and,! Euphrates. Mesopotamia owes its past importance to the wealth won from the rich soil of the Delta by means of the ancient systems of irrigation, of which abundant evidence exists even to-day, and the future progress ot the country depends upon the proper utilisation of its rivers for irrigation and navigation. The Shatt el-Arah is navigable by ocean-going steamers. At Eao the average width of the river is 1 mile, decreasing gradually to ^ mile at the mouth of the Karun River, which flows in on the left bank 40 miles above Fao; above this point the river imme diately decreases to a mean breadth of 600 yards. Between Basra and Kurna the river gradually narrows to 250 yards. Its utility ^cr navigation is at present impeded by a bank of silt known as the Fao bar, which lies across the mouth of the river at Fao, and gives at low water a maximum depth of 11 feet only, with the result that vessels of larger draught are compelled either to wait for the tide or to trans-ship a portion of their cargo to lighters outside the bar. The depth of water over the bar at spring tides is 20 ft., at neap tides 17 ft. Beyond the bar there is a depth of from 30 to 40 ft. up to Basra, except at two places, of which the more serious is the Muhammera bar, just below the confluence of the Karun River. Vessels drawing [285—66] E 252 EOONOMTG CONDITIONS not more than 15 ft. can get up as far as Kurna. 1 Native craft used on the Shatt el-Arab are mostly b?IIavis, long, narrow boats which can be sailed, rowed, or, as is more usual, punted or towed, and which can carry a load of 50 tons.. The only places of importance on the Shatt el-Arab are the Persian port of Muham- mera, at the junction of the Karun River with the Shatt el-Arab; Basra,the seaport of Mesopotamia; and Nahr Umar, which is on the right bank. 20 miles above Basra, and has heen developed as a port since the British military occupation. 7 he Tigris, from the point of view of navigation, can most conveniently be considered in two sections: first, the section between Kurna and Baghdad, which is at present the upper limit of steam navigation; secondly, that between Baghdad and Mosul. The distance from Kurna to Baghdad, following the general direction of the river, is under 300 miles; but the frequent bends make the distance by water about 448 miles. Owing to the river's winding course, the silt deposited during the season of flood forms banks which, when the water is low, constitute a great hindrance to navigation. In high-water season, steamers of not more than 5 ft. draught can navigate the Tigris from Kurna to Baghdad; and the difficulties of navigation are mainly those caused by the swiftness of the current, which, according to some authorities, reaches 6 miles per hour at the height of the flood. At low water, vessels drawing more than 3 ft. cannot navigate the section between Ezra s Tomb and Kale Sale, where the river has been much damaged as a waterway by native cultivators, who have thrown out brushwood groynes in order to assist irrigation or to reclaim the land, and have done other damage by cutting irrigation channels at the concave sides of the bends. Sir William Willcocks, who was called in to advise the ' For the terms of the agreernent of 1P1B, under which the navigation of the river was to be surveyed by a special Com- mission, see above, p. 31.Mesopotamia] II1 \ JiliS A.ND CANALS O'i Turkish Government as to the best method of irrigat ing the Delta of the Tigris and Euphrates, expressed the opinion that the Tigris would soon cease to be navigable between these two points unless steps were taken to remedy matters. The rest of the river up to Baghdad is navigable at all seasons of the year by vessels drawing not more than 5 ft. of water. There are bridges of boats crossing the river at Kale Sale, Amara, Kut, Gerara, and Baghdad. For steamers with a speed of 10 knots the journey from Baghdad to Basra takes about 47 hours, and from Basra to Baghdad about 78 hours in the low-water season, and about 100 hours in flood-time. Before the war steam navigation on the Tigris up to Baghdad was carried on by Lynch Bros., Ltd., by the Turkish Government Kiver Administration, and by the Agra Jaffer Company. The last-named com pany ran three steamers, towing one barge each, on the Tigris, and another on the Shatt el-Arab, between Basra and Muhammera. The Turkish Government, immediately before the war, had a fleet of seven or eight steamers trading on the Tigris. Lynch Bros, have for many years had the right to maintain on the Tigris two steamers, each towing tw T o barges; and recently they were allowed to put on a third steamer, also with thie right of towing two barges, on condition that it sailed under the Turkish flag. Some of their steamers could, in favourable conditions of the river, take a cargo of as much as 400 tons. Of other vessels trading on this part of the river the most important types were the native craft known as safineh and quffeh. The safineh are the more important, being large boats, drawing from 3| to 4J ft. of water, and capable of carrying a cargo of 100 tons - ; they can be sailed or rowed with the stream; up-stream they are usually either punted or towed. The quffeh is a large coracle, used for the conveyance of passengers. It cannot be used satisfactorily against the stream. The interruption of navigation by the hostility of the Arab tribes inhabiting the river banks has been much less54 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS Irequent of recent years, but is reported to have inter fered with the trade of the river below Baghdad in 1907, 1908, and 1909. The rates of steamer freight 011 r i ver the four years before the war aver aged 27s. &lt;dcl. per ton from Basra to Baghdad, and 155, a ton from Baghdad to Basra, 1 In 1913 the I urkish Government granted a con cession to Lord Inchcape for navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates as far as Mosul and Meskene respec tively. The main provisions of this concession are given on p. 100, Above Baghdad the bed of the river is alluvial up to Beled, above which town the river flows over a bed of either clay, sand, hard conglomerate, or shingle, and there are numerous rapids, islands, and rocks, which render navigation up-stream impracticable by steamers, though a small launch plied between Bagh dad and Samarra (90 miles) before the war, and there is a record of a steamer having, in 1838, reached a point 28 miles below Mosul. Commercial traffic on the river between Baghdad and Mosul is carried on, down- stream only, by native keleks. These are large rafts of timber or poles and brushwood, supported on in flated skins, and are floated down on the current, being kept in the stream by two rough sweeps. They can carry ,) to 35 tons, according to their size. On arrival at their destination, these rafts are broken up, the timber sold, and the skins taken back to the point of departure, When the river is in flood the journey from Mosul to Baghdad takes three or four days; at low water, when rafts have to lie up at night, it' takes between ten and twelve days. The distance from Baghdad to Mosul is 275 miles. The river is crossed by boat bridges at Mosul, Samarra, and Kazimain, Of the tributaries of the Tigris, the Diala is navigable from the beginning of December to April as tar as Bakuba (about 52 miles), and the Lesser Zab 1 I hese rates have been very considerably increased during theMesopotamia] KIVERS AND CANALS 55 for rafts down-stream from Altun Keupri (74 miles). Neither the Adheim nor the Greater Zab is navigable. The Euphrates. —It is doubtful whether the Euphrates has ever been used for navigation to any considerable extent, except by small native craft. Immediately before the war its use as a commercial waterway was insignificant, and was attended by some dangers owing to the attitude of the Muntifik Arabs. A glance at the map makes the idea of the commercial use of the Euphrates between Basra and Meskene very attractive, but it is clear that, beiore any such scheme could be put into practice, prolonged study of the river would have to be undertaken, and no doubt very large engineering works would be required. It will be convenient here to consider the navigation oi the Euphrates in three sections, the first from Kurna to the Hindie barrage, the second from the Hindie barrage to Hit, the third from Hit to Meskene. (i) Kurna to the Hindie Barrage.— to the numerous irrigation canals, which have been cut without system and allowed to fall into dis repair, the river has ceased to be navigable below Nasrie except in flood-time, and Sir William Willcocks reported that the old channel of the Euphrates, from Suk esh-Sheyukh to Kurna, had ceased to carry any considerable quantity of Euphrates water, and that the water was finding its way through the Hammar lake to the Shatt el-Arab at Gurmat Ah. Looking at the question solely from the point of view of irrigation, he proposed to use the old channel merely as a drain for water diverted from the Tigris below Amara for irrigation purposes. Shortly after the British military occupation of Lower Mesopotamia, steps were taken to render navigable this old channel, and for this purpose the Chubaish bar was cut through, and dredging was begun at the northern end of the Hammar lake. This work was, however, discontinued for military56 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS inc. es reasons, and the river is in about as bad a con dition as before. Between Nasrie and feamawa the river Hows in a firm bed, the lamiliar obstacles to navigation are absent, and a minimum depth of 5 ft. of water can be obtained at all times of the year. Between Samawa and the Hindie barrage all the diffi culties of navigation found in the lower stretches of the river recur in an aggravated form. The Hindie branch of the river (the only one upon which navigation can be carried on all the year round) is surrounded by 'khors,' or marshes, which are sometimes above and sometimes below water level, and water is drawn oil by numerous canals. In consequence, the river between Samawa and the barrage can, at certain seasons of the year, be navigated only by vessels drawing less than 2 ft. of water. There are two locks at the Hindie barrage, which are designed to take vessels of about 5 ft. draught at the period of lowest water. (ii) Hindie Barrage to Hit. —This section is navig able by steamers drawing not more than 4 to 5 ft. at all seasons of the year, though, until the wash of steamer traffic has helped to clear the channel, navigation at some points might be difficult, i he river flows between high banks, and its width varies from 150 to 500 yards. 1 he current, which at low water is about \\ miles per hour, increases to 5 miles per hour in flood. (iiij Hit to Meskene. —Above Hit the bed of the ri\er ceases to be alluvial, and there are rapids at various places, especially between Hit and Ana, which renders navigation extremely diffi cult and dangerous, except when the river is in flood. Banks of shingle and sand are also found. From April to July, when the river is full, its descent would be easy for light-draught steamers, and could be accomplished at a greatMesopotamia] R1VEKS AND CANALS 57 speed, but the journey up-stream would be very slow, and between Hit and Ana would prcba bly be impossible for any steamer whose speed was less than 12 knots an hour. At present practically all traffic on this section is down stream, and is carried on by shakhturs, Hat- bottomed boats built at Birijik, w T hich when loaded do not draw more than ft. of water. These craft carry a load of about 5 tons, are steered by clumsy sweeps in the bows, and are floated down-stream loaded and towed up-stream empty. Of the canals which take off from the Tigris and Euphrates many are navigable by small native craft at certain seasons of the year, but only the Shatt el-Hai, which leaves the right bank of the ligris at Kut, and the Saklawie, which runs from-the Euphrates, about 10 miles above Feluja, to the Tigris at Baghdad, are navigable for large craft. In flood-time both these are navigable by hellains, and it is stated that the Saklawie has been navigated by steamers as recently as 1916. With the future of navigation in Mesopotamia are involved twoi questions—first, the requirements oi water for irrigation, and secondly, the competition be tween river navigation and railways. The former would affect navigation from Tekrit and Ramadlie downwards, the latter might threaten its very exist ence as a commercial proposition. Down to the summer of 1914 the only expert report bearing on these problems was that made by Sir W. Willcocks to the Turkish Government upon the possi bilities of reviving the irrigation of Mesopotamia. Sir W. Willcocks' conclusions are summed up in the words '.rivers for irrigation, railways for com munications,' and his report proposed seven large schemes for the irrigation of the Delta between the line Feluja—Tekrit and Fao, and for the prevention of floods, and one small scheme for the improvemento8 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 952 of navigation on the Tigris between Amara and Kurna. Ihe total cost of the scheme was estimated at £1.29,000,000/ and the plan was admitted to depend commercially upon the construction of adequate rail ways between Baghdad and Basra along the line of the two rivers, and possibly of a further railway from Mesopotamia across the Syrian Desert to one of the Syrian ports on the Mediterranean; the cost of these was not included in the scheme. Recently Sir W. \\ illcocks' report has been subjected to considerable criticism upon purely engineering grounds; for instance, it is doubtful, having regard to the enormous quantities of silt carried by the Tigris and Euphrates when in Hood, whether his devices for preventing floods w T ould be permanently successful. In any case there are drawbacks to any scheme which accepts as permanent the degeneration of the Lower Euphrates, and is prepared to acquiesce in the aban donment as an irreclaimable swamp of the large area between Suk esh-Sheyukh and GurmatAli, which in the past has been a prosperous and fertile agricultural dis trict. Moreover, Sir W. Willcocks' scheme is open to criticism on other grounds. First, it advocates the reclamation by irrigation of enormous areas, for which there is at present no agiricultural population, and from which no return could be obtained for a very long time. Secondly, it overlooks the political difficulties to which the introduction of settlers would inevitably give rise. Thirdly, there is no reason w r hy irrigation and navigation should not be effectively combined, and. indeed, be made mutually advantageous for a long time to come. Recently Sir George Buchanan has made a report on the regeneration of the river systems of Mesopotamia, which throws a great deal of light upon the condition of the rivers to-day, and the possibilities of their utilisation as waterways in the future. He states that the difficulties of navigation on both the Tigris and 1 Turkish pounds. Normally the Turkish poimd = 18s.Mesopotamia] HIVEKS AND CANALS 5!) Euphrates and their present unsatisfactory condition are due to three causes ;— (1) An enormous quantity of silt is carried in sus pension in times and seasons of flood, and is de posited in the bed of the river and over the country in the immediate neighbourhood as soon as the current is lessened from any cause; in consequence of this the level oi. the river bed has, in the course of centuries, been raised above the'surrounding country, so that it is difficult to control floods. (2) The ignorant Arab methods of irrigation have been allowed to go on unhindered lor centuries. Irrigation, cuts made during the low-water season have developed in flood-time to bi oad rivers, spreading uncontrolled over the country, which, by lessening the flow in the river bed, have caused silt to be deposited in such quantities that by degrees the original bed of the river in places has become only a channel for carrying flood-water; of this there are instances both on the Tigris and Euphrates, the best known being that which has occurred at Hindie, where the main Euphrates river has ceased, except during the hi^li-water season, to flow down the Hilla branch, past the site of Babylon, and now goes down the Hindie branch. (3) The Arabs had a system of building out bunds' (hurdle-work projections) into the river, either for the purpose of assisting iiriga- tion, or in order to collect silt, and thereby reclaim land for cultivation. Owing to the military situation at the time he made his report. Sir George Buchanan had no opportunity of considering in detail the problems presented b\ the Euphrates; moreover, the whole question of the regene ration of the rivers is one upon which reliable con clusions can only be reached after more caretul stud) of the rivers than is possible to-day. But the experi-60 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 ence gained from certain works which were carried out on his instructions lor the purpose of improving the navigation of the Tigris between Amara and Kurna, shows (1) that w T here steps are taken to keep the river within bounds it will quickly lower its bed, establish a better channel, and maintain that improvement; (2) that improvements in the river can be made without sacrificing its use for irrigation, though in some dis tricts this would involve an alteration of the methods ol cultivation not altogether to the liking of the Arabs. It is piobabh sate to assume that if works are taken in hand with the object of keeping the rivers within bounds in all but the very highest flood-times—a period which may be measured in weeks—and of making them scour out again the channels w T hich they used in the past, both the ligris and Euphrates might be made navigable throughout the year by steamers of consider able tonnage as far as Samarra and Hit respectively, and in the case of the Tigris this would probably not be a very difficult or expensive matter. Sir George Buchanan deprecates the adoption of the scheme proposed by ^ir W. Willcocks, or of any other scheme, until the problems of regeneration, navigation, and irrigation have been considered in all their bear- ings by a competent committee of engineers. He is of opinion that it will be many years before the waters of these rivers will be required for irrigation to such an extent that navigation will have to give way. No reports are available upon the possibility of makmg the Tigris navigable above Samarra and the Euphrates above Hit. The main differences between the problems of the upper rivers and those presented within the irrigation area are, first, the absence of the competing claims of irrigation and navigation and secondly, the difference in the nature of the beds over w iich the rivers flow. Fhe expense of upkeep of any improvement m navigation made in the upper reaches would be much less than that which must necessarily be involved in the alluvial regions of Lower Mesopotamia. Mnch Brothers have expressed the opinion that itMesopotamia] R I VERS AND CANALS 61 would not be difficult to render the Euphrates navi gable between Hit and Meskene. The obstructions to navigation to-day are chiefly caused by stone aqueducts, used for carrying water for irrigation from water- wheels working in the river, and, to a less extent, by rocks and the ruins of old bridges in the bed of the river. The actual cost of removing these obstructions would probably be small, but it would be necessary to provide other means for irrigating the land after the removal of the water-wheels and aqueducts. There is to-day a considerable traffic down-stream, but the traffic up-river is very small. Lynch Brothers are ol opinion that a river transport service on the upper Euphrates would in time be commercially profitable. With regard to the Tigris, Lynch Brothers consider that it would be possible at moderate cost to make the river navigable as far as !&gt;hirghat (about 80 miles below Mosul). Blasting operations would be necessary, in order to remove rocks in the channel, and a certain amount of dredging would also be involved, but these operations would not be costly. Between ^hirghat and Mosul it would probably be found essential to construct some canals and dams, in order to make navigation practicable across the rapids. As to how far the initial capital outlay on the work of improving the channel could be made remuneiative, it is difficult to obtain a reliable opinion. There is no reason to doubt that much of the produce which now goes by caravan to Aleppo would be diverted to Bagh dad, and that there would be a large export of grain, wool, &amp;c. On the other hand, the continuation of the Baghdad Railway from Mosul to Samarra would naturally have an important bearing on the com mercial possibilities of river transport services^ All questions of navigation must hinge on the ques tion of railway competition. How far railways \m11 in the future supersede navigation in Mesopotamia it is impossible to forecast. Sir George Buchanan expresses the opinion, based on his expciiences m62 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 India, where the same problems have arisen, that a well-managed river service would easily hold its o'wn, and thinks that, though at first there might be some difficulty in making both railway and river pay, in the future there would certainly be sufficient trade to keep both well employed. (c) Railways Baghdad Railway. —The projected routes of this railway and of the branch lines proposed are shown approximately on the appended map. The railway enters Mesopotamia at the crossing of the Euphrates at Jerablus, and the distance from that point along the proposed route is about 575 miles to Baghdad, and about 970 miles to Basra, without allowing for curves. Branches to Urfa, Khanikin, and the Persian Gulf, were included in the original concession as part of the line which the company was to undertake to build; branches towards Birijik, Mardin, Erbil, and Tuz- Khurmatli were not obligatory, but the company had preferential rights to construct them. The line has been completed from Baghdad north to Fekrit, west to Feluja on the Euphrates, south to IIilia (whence a light railway of 2 ft. 6 in. gauge has been completed to Kefl), also from Jerablus east to El-Helif. south-east of Mardin. Of these sections the first mentioned only was complete as far as Samarra before war broke o'ut. Construction has also been begun upon the section Tekrit to Shoreimieh. The gauge is the normal European gauge of 4 ft. in., and the mode of traction is the usual adhe sion system. According to the specification, the line is to be made capable of carrying a very heavy load. At Jerablus there is a bridge' about 890 yards in length, consisting of 10 spans with overhead lattice girders Its width is 20 ft., including a 4-ft. pathway. ' The concession for the construction of the line was granted to the Socidte du Chemin de fer OttomanMesopotamia] RAILWAYS 63 d'Anatolie by a convention dated March 5, 1903, 1 but the rights were transferred to a company formed by the concessionnaires, under the title of The Imperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company,' with a s.hare capital of 15,000,000 francs, of which the Anatolian Railway Co. was bound to subscribe and hold 10 per cent., and the Turkish Government had the right to subscribe a further 10 per cent. The whole of the capi tal has been issued and is paid up to the extent of 50 per cent. In 1913 there were 27 directors, of whom the President and 10 others were German, 4 were Turks, 8 French, 2 Swiss, 1 Italian, and 1 Austrian. The concession is for 99 years. The railway was to be con structed in sections of approximately 200 kilometres in length, and it was intended that the whole line with its branches should be completed within 8 years from the date of the convention. The line was to be a single track throughout, but land sufficient for a double line was to be acquired in the first instance, and the com pany was placed under an obligation to build a second line at its own expense as soon as the gross receipts reached 30,000 francs per kilometre per annum. The financial arrangements were as follows:— The concessionnaires undertook to build the railway at their own expense, the Turkish Government guaran teeing an annual sum of 11,000 francs per kilometre constructed and opened for traffic, and a further an nual sum for working expenses ot 4,500 francs per kilometre. It was arranged • that this kilometric guarantee of 11,000 francs should be capitalised, and that the Turkish Government should hand to the con cessionnaires State bonds liearing interest at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund of 0875 per cent., redeemable during the period of the concession. On the basis agreed the Turkish Government was therefore bound to hand to the company bonds of a nominal value of 1 The political importance of the concessions under which the Baghdad Railway Company was formed is dealt with above,64 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS no. 92 269.110 francs per kilometre constructed and open to traffic. 1 he issue price of the bonds was agreed at a minimum of 81^ per cent. The convention contained a very indefinite provision to the effect that as soon as the growth of the traffic and receipts and the financial situation permitted, the concessionnaires should issue bonds of their own to replace the bonds issued to them by the Imperial Government. The receipts of the line were apportioned between the Turkish Government and the Company as follows : (1) The first 4,500 francs per kilometre were to go to the Company in relief of the Government's obligation to cover the working expenses at the agreed rate. (2) I he surplus above 4,500 francs per kilometre up to 10,000 francs per kilometre was to go to the Turkish Government. (3) Of any excess over 10,000 francs per kilometre the Government was to get 60 per cent, and the Company 40 per cent. From the point of view of the concessionnaires the bargain was a good one, provided the bonds of the Turkish Government could be realised at a fair price. The bonds necessary to secure the kilometric guarantee were issuable to the concessionnaires on the signature of the special convention relating to each section; consequently the concessionnaires were not under the Tiecessity of finding any money themselves if they could succeed in placing the Turkish bonds upon the European market, and the liberal payment per kilo metre allowed for by the terms of the convention gave them an ample margin for doing this. How far the arrangement was sound finance from the 1 urkish point of view is a matter of opinion. The amount of the bonds issued by the Turkish Government to cover the kilometric guarantee on the first section was 54,000,000 francs, on the second section 108,000,000 francs, and on the third section 119,000.000 francs orMesopotamial RAILWAYS 65 a total of 281,000,000 francs, involving an annual sum for interest of over 11,000,000 francs. It is argued that the kilometric guarantee undertaken by the Turkish Government when the Anatolian Railway was constructed was higher than that undertaken in this case, and that nevertheless that line has proved a source of profit to the Turkish Government. If the develop ment of agriculture in the districts to be tapped by the Baghdad Railway is equally rapid, the burden which the Turkish Government has undertaken may not prove more than the country can carry, but the large amount of bonds issuable in respect of the guarantee must of necessity prove a hindrance to financial operations required for other purposes. It is impossible to do more than generalise as to the economici prospects of the line. Tt will tap a large area, which possesses enormous agricultural possibilities, and its branch lines to the Persian frontier and else where will put it into immediate touch with the places where traffic is most capable of expansion ; the flow of pilgrims to Baghdad, Nejef, and Kerbela is also expected to provide an abundant source of revenue. There is a provision of economic importance under which the concessionnaires may work any mines dis covered within a zone of 20 kilometres on each side of the line; but this right does not give them any privilege or monopoly. The Company paid dividends up to 5 per cent, regularly down to 1912, and at the end of that year's working had a reserve of over 6,000,000 francs. The war has naturally had disastrous effects, and at the meeting of the Company held in February 1918 the chairman stated that the receipts for 1916 had been nearly 15,000,000 francs less than those for 1915, and was silent a.s to the result of the year 1917. He stated, however, that the contract with the construction com pany had been denounced, and that the railway company was in urgent need of financial help. Other Railways in Mesopotamia completed or under construction are all the work of the British army of [285—66] F06 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 occupation, and have been built for military purposes. .With the exception of a small 2ft. 6in. line between Sadiyeh on the Tigris and Shahroban on the Khanikin road they are all of 1-metre gauge. Proposed railways. —As has already been said, Sir William Willcocks, in connection with his irrigatioi. schemes, proposed the construction of a considerable system of railways in Lower Mesopotamia, and of a trunk line, connecting Baghdad by the Euphrates valley with either Homs or Damascus and the Medi terranean. Commercially all these proposed lines depend upon the development of Mesopotamia and the adequacy or otherwise of the rivers for the conveyance of goods; and upon these points it is at present impossible to arrive at any useful con clusions. In the event of a line being built to connect Mesopo tamia with a Syrian port, probably the best route would be Abu Kemal—Tadmor—Homs, and thence to Tripoli, as the line between Tripoli and Homs is of standard gauge, and has comparatively easy gradients and good alignment. Such a line would no doubt attract a large traffic of pilgrims to Mecca. Of even more importance to British trade with Persia is the building of a line from Baghdad to the Persian frontier, and if possible to Kermanshah. The imports to Persia via Baghdad have in recent years averaged £1,000,000 annually, of which 75 per cent, have been British or Indian goods. Pussian competition in Per sian markets was increasing before the war; and, in the future, British trade in Persia is likely to meet with strong opposition from the north in German, if not in Russian, goods. Apart from the goods traffic, a very large revenue would be obtained from the pil grim traffic to and from the shrines of Mesopotamia. (d) Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones The Turkish postal service in Mesopotamia was extremely uncertain; special messengers, travellers.Mesopotamia] POSTS, &amp;c. «7 and passing muleteers were much used to supplement it. There used to be a fortnightly camel-post from Hit to Damascus for letters only, but this was discontinued in 1912 owing to the frequency of attacks by Bedouins; between 1912 and 1914 the Baghdad-Damascus post adopted the long Aleppo route, of which the Baghdad- Aleppo section alone required eight days in summer, ten in autumn, and fourteen in winter. There was a parcel-post from Europe to Baghdad either by Brindisi, Bombay, and Basra, or by Beirut and Aleppo; the former, being safer, was usually preferred. Money orders could be obtained from the Anglo- Indian ' Post Office at Baghdad; the Turkish Post Office would only issue money orders for inland use. Fao is the terminus of the Indo-European Telegraph Company ; the office, formerly Anglo-1 urkish, is now wholly British. Before the war the Turkish main telegraph lines ran as follows:— (1) Fao — Basra — Kurna — Baghdad — Kirkuk —Erbil—Mosul. (2) Baghdad — Feluja — Hit — Ana — Meskene— Aleppo. (3) Baghdad—Khanikin—Kermanshah—Teheran. (4) Mosul—Nisibin—Mardin—Diarbekr. There was a loop line from Kurna to Baghdad round the Euphrates towns — Kurna — Suk esh- Sheyukh — Samawa — Hilla — Kerbela — Museyib —Baghdad. Erbil had two lines towards the Persian frontier, one to Rowanduz, the other via Rania to Kaladiza. Kerbela had lines to Baghdad via 11 ilia, and to Kufa via Nejef. * The working of the telegraph was often unreliable. There were no telephones in Mesopotamia before the war. [285—66] F 268 ECONOMTC CONDITIONS [No. 92 (2) External (a) Parts Basra is situated on the right bank of the Shatt el- Arab, 70 miles above Fao. With the possible exception ot Nahr I mar {see below), Basra is the only port of Mesopotamia which can be used by deep-sea steamers. Its population in 1914 was about 80,000, mostly Arabs. Basra is not only the centre of the import trade of Mesopotamia, but the port to which aire consigned practically all goods destined for Kermanshah in Persia, such goods being trans-shipped to river steamers for Baghdad, whence they are forwarded into Persia by road. The imports consist chiefly of Man chester goods, sugar, wood, gunnies, indigo, iron and steel, and general merchandise; exports are cereals and rice, dates, wool, gall-nuts, hides, and horses.

Includes stoam lighters to and from the bar.Mesopotamia] PGR lb Before the war there was no accommodation for steamers, and the loading and unloading ut caigoes was done in the river by means of lighters and native craft. The inadequacy of the service of river steamers for the forwarding of goods up-country gave much ground for complaint, especially during the low-water season, as goods had often to remain at Basra for so long that the market at Baghdad was lost, and con signees were compelled to store goods until the lollow- ing year. In 1906 as much as 3,000 tons ot cargo \\ere lying at one time at Basra awaiting trans -shipment by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Co. Matters were subsequently improved by the grant of permission to Lynch Brothers to run an extra steamei. A further source of complaint has been the Turkish Customs House at Basira. Until the completion in 1913 of the new Customs House (the construction ot which was begun in 1905), the old Customs House had been left untouched for 25 years, and much damage was done to cargo owing to its inadequacy and bad state of repair. Since the military occupation wharves have been built, where vessels can lie alongsi e and discharge their cargoes at all states of the tide, whilst there is mooring accommodation in the river opposite Basra for 24 sea-going steamers. The future of Basra depends upon the removal ot the bar at the mouth of the Shatt el-Arab, so as to make the river navigable by large vessels at all states oi the tide. Assuming that this is done, and that Mesopo tamia is placed under the control of a Power which wui foster its development upon right lines, Basra has a great future before it. Sir George Buchanan, in a report upon ithe development of Basra as a port, has expressed the view that, given the conditions mentioned above:— . „ (i) Basra will become the principal seaport ot Persia as well as of Mesopotamia. (ii) The Persian Gulf ports will be largely served by coasting steamers from Basra rather than from Europe or India direct;70 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS wo. 92 (in) There will be a great increase of trade with the Far East and India, and India will find in Mesopo tamia and Persia a ready market for manufactured goods; (iv) I here will be a large passenger traffic between -Basra and ports in India; (v) The trade of the port of Basra will have nothing to fear from railway competition via the Baghdad Railway. Nahr Ami, on the right bank of the Shatt el-Arab,- twenty miles by river above Basra, has recently been developed as a port of discharge for ocean-going s tea me is. 1 articulars as to the accommodation there are not available, but recent information is to the effect that the capacity of discharging cargo at Basra and JNahj Amr is ec|ual to about 150,000 tons per month.

LABOUR 71 (B) INDUSTRY (1) Labour The agricultural development of Mesopotamia is con ditioned and limited by the capacity, chaiacter, and temperament of the inhabitants; agricultural tegeneia- tion can only be effected if labour is available, not only for the construction and upkeep of irrigation works, but for the constant and exacting toil upon the land which the extension of cultivation will involve. The population of the vilayets of Baghdad and Basra does not exceed 1,500,000, and is probably not more than 1,000,000; this gives a density of less than 10 persons per square mile, which is quite insufficient toi aiiA lai reaching scheme of agricultural development. Of this population Arabs form the vast majority, but K.uids, Turkomans, Persians, Jews, and Armenians are largely intermingled, and amongst the Arabs, in addition to the barrier interposed by differences of religion, there are lines of cleavage between^ the town- dweller and the nomad or semi-nomad, which hinder combination and progress. Before the war it was said of the Arab that he was averse from hard manual labour, and was imbued with an optimistic fatalism destructive of all material pro gress. On the other hand, it was found that, \Nheie he had learnt to appreciate a greater standard of comfort, his Semitic instincts acted as a spur, and he became industrious. It must, however, be remembered that conditions have not been favourable; the climate in the south is enervating, the soil is rich, and undei the system of agriculture adopted by the Arabs sustained eifort has so far been unnecessary. Moreover, the general feeling of insecurity to which the vagaries of the rivers contributed in no small degreei, and the absence, under Turkish rule, of any redress against the depredations of envious neighbours, discouraged efforts towards material prosperity.72 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 The Arab has, however, come remarkably well out of the tests which have been made of his industrial capacity, both immediately before the war, when there was a large demand for labour in connection with the construction of the Hindie barrage, and since the mili tary occupation by the British armies. Sir John Jack son's firm, which constructed the barrage for the Turkish Government, found that labour was plentiful and good, except during the seed-time, harvest, and irrigation periods. The employment of Arab labour for military purposes on a large scale, and under organ ized conditions, has brought out the following instruc tive facts:— (1) There is a considerable surplus of labour beyond that required at present for the tilling of the soil. (2) If the demand for labour is made with reason able consideration for the habits of the people, s and for the fluctuating requirements of agri culture at different seasons, no unwillingness is shown in meeting it. (3) Arab labour is extremely efficient and can com mand high wages on piece-work. Those respon sible for the recent organization of this labour pay high testimony to its merits. They say that the Arab is cheerful, uncomplaining, and wil ling, that he does more than the average Indian coolie, and is easy to handle if properly treated, and provided that somebody is placed over him to whom he can explain his grievances in his own language, and scrupulous attention is paid to tribal distinctions. The Arab is less conservative than the Indian coolie, is easily taught, and readily adapts himself to modern methods. Sir William Willcocks has expressed the view that, if Mesopotamia were made fertile by irrigation, settlers would flock to the country, which would in a short time become both populous and prosperous. This opinionMesopotamia] I j AJBOI Hi should be accepted with the greatest reserve. Any influx of settlers into Mesopotamia would immediately raise questions of great difficulty with nomadic or semi- nomadic tribes, who claim a prescriptive right to large areas in Irak and the Jezireh, and unless the settleis are Arabs much unrest would probably result. 1 On the other hand, there has been from time immemorial a certain amount of immigration of the surplus Arab population into Mesopotamia, and even to-day the Shammar tribe, which is settled on the right bank ol the Tigris south of Mosul, is looked upon as part of the tribe of the same name which is found in central Arabia. Immigration of this kind will no doubt con tinue, and will provide some additional small sources from which labour will be available. The rates of wages for unskilled labour before the war were from 3 to 4 G.S.P. 2 (6^/. U) Sd.) per day. Skilled labour was paid from 5 to 10 G.fe.P. (10^. to 15. 8c?.) per day. (2) Agriculture According to Herodotus, the yield of the soil ot Mesopotamia in his time was as high as 200 or even 300 to 1. Even to-day, although a great part ot the country is an arid waste, the chemical constituents of the soil are such that only irrigation and tillage are necessary to bring out its potential fertility, and repro duce former conditions. In north Mesopotamia agriculture is in a less deplor able condition than in the south and is improving, but there the soil is more stony and less fertile, the rivers do not lend themselves so easily to irrigation, and the country suffers from drought. 1 he latter difficulty is to some extent being overcome by the introduction d centrifugal pumps driven by oil engines. The decay of agriculture in Lower Mesopotamia has been progressive since the beginning of lurkish rule in 1 For further observations on this question, se&gt; above, p. 42. 2 Grand Seignmir piastres.74 ECONOMIC CON 1)1 T IONS [No. 92 the year 1258. Under the Turks both irrigation and river conservancy have been neglected, and tract after tract of once fertile land has fallen out of use, until to-day only about l/25th of the country is cultivated. The richest soil is found in the alluvial plains of Irak, but only 5 per cent, of the cultivable area of Basra vilayet is now tilled. Great permanent swamps have been formed, and, even where the swamps are not per manent, the evaporation of flood-waters has left in the soil deposits of salt, which are detrimental to agricul ture, whilst the lack of irrigation has turned thousands of acres of fertile land into desert. German writers have variously estimated the sabad, or rich alluvial soil of Mesopotamia, at from 2.3 to 60 million acres in extent; but these are probably over-estimates; in any case, from 2^ to nearly 5 million acres are continually flooded. Of the other causes which have contributed to the decay of the country the following are the most im portant :— (a) In the days of her'prosperity Mesopotamia was the centre of trade between the East and the West. The course of trade, however, was altered by the discovery of the route by the Cape of Good Hope, and subsequently by the construc tion of the Suez Canal, and Mesopotamia is to-day in a backwater. (b) No attempt has been made until quite recently to develop adequate internal communications. Turkey has been quite apathetic about the needs - of the country in this respect, and even as late as 1912 was placing every possible difficulty in the way of an adequate steam transport service on the Tigris. (c) The absence of a Government strong enough to prevent the feuds between neighbouring tribes, and incursions of Kurds from the hills, has created a sense of insecurity fatal to the develop ment of agriculture. The vagaries of the rivers also contributed to this feeling, because districtsMetiopotamial AGRICULTURE 75 which in one year were rendered fertile by irri gation might in the next year be either arid wastes or under water for months together. (d) Owing to the uncertainty of laud tenure, there has been no incentive to improve the soil. Even the sheikhs rarely held land on more than a five years' lease, and their tenants often only yearly. (e) The Government system of farming out its land taxes offered every opportunity for exaction and oppression. (/) The scarcity and uncertainty of labour fre quently caused the postponement of wheat and barley sowing till long past the date when it was most advantageous to sow. Moreover, it pre vented attention being given to the intensive cultivation of cotton, tobacco, &amp;c. {g) The lack of agricultural credit facilities dis couraged the cultivator. (a) Methods of Cultivation In Mesopotamia there are two harvests. Wheat, barley, and miscellaneous crops, such as beans, are sown in the autumn or winter, and are harvested in April and May; rice, peas, and maize are sown during the spring floods, and are harvested between August and November. Cultivation is primitive, and intensive methods are unknown outside the immediate vicinity of the towns. This is largely due to the uncertainty of tenure, but also to the ease with which the Arab, thanks to the fertility of the soil, can obtain a crop sufficient to satisfy his needs. The ground is given only one very light ploughing, and is never properly broken up, and the upturned soil is not exposed to the sun and air for any length of time. Moreover, the practice of waiting for the first rain before sowing often results in the seed being put into the ground much later than it should be. Wheat and barley are often sown as late as March. This is because the population is in many places insuf ficient to look after both the rice crops and the spring76 ECONOMIC (■ONDIT1ONS [No. 92 cro})s. The wheat and barley tribes migrate to the rice tracts after the spring harvest, and do no ploughing for their spring crops until the work of gathering and threshing the rice crop has been finished. Thus nothing is done towards the preparation of the soil for the young crops until about the end of December. Irrigation is the basis of cultivation, and the crops grown are conditioned by the possibilities of obtaining water. The main systems of irrigation practised in Mesopotamia to-day are the following; (1) Irrigation by means of cherrads or water lifts with pulleys and buckets. This system is mainly used for date gardens, and only to a small extent for the irrigation of arable lands. It is found in Lower Mesopotamia {i.e., south of Baghdad), and also higher up the rivers, especially along the Euphrates above Hit. The system is ex pensive in labour and leaves little profit to the cultivator; it is being to a small extent sup planted by the use of centrifugal pumps driven by oil engines. (2) Irrigation by means of channels along which the fresh water is forced by the rise of the tide on the Shatt el-Arab. (3) Irrigation by canals. The silt brought down during the annual floods has raised the rivers and their branches above the surrounding coun try, so that there is a gradual descent from the borders of all rivers and canals to the swamps. The higher ground is only irrigated at the time of full flood, and is always dry during the cold weather ; the intermediate slopes can usually command water for irrigation during most of the spring and summer ; the low land is always wet. There is, therefore, from every channel a graduation of slopes, of which the higher are suitable for growing wheat and barley, the inter mediate for such crops as millet and maize, after the floods have somewhat subsided, and the lower for rice. The rice land is again sub-Mesopotamia] CULTIVATION 77 divided into two classes, the higher land which can command water throughout the rice season, but is not always under water, and the lower land which is always under a certain amount of water. In the higher land rice is sown broadcast, while in the lower it is transplanted. (b) Products of Commercial Value Dates. —The cultivation of the date palm is the most important branch of agriculture in Mesopotamia, for dates are the chief article of food, and usually the most valuable export. The ex{)ort averages about 60,000 tons annually, and is capable of considerable expansion. It has been said that Mesopotamia grows 80 per cent, of the world's total produce in dates. Dates require a plentiful supply of water, and there fore their cultivation is general only in the alluvial tracts bordering the rivers in Lower Mesopotamia, although the date palm is found elsewhere also. On the other hand, flooding is bad for the trees, and causes ' date fever.' Consequently the groves have to be pro tected against floods by large dykes or ' sudds.' The fertilisation of the blossom is done by hand, a few male trees being planted among the female. The chief centres of cultivation are:— (1) The Shatt el-Arab Belt. On the right bank the date palms form a continuous grove, half a mile to two miles wide, between the river and the desert. On the left bank the groves are younger and more broken. The immediate neighbour hood of Basra is probably the finest date-grow ing region in the world. The date gardens of the Shatt el-Arab are intersected by irrigation trenches, connected with creeks along which fresh water is forced by the rise of the tide, and by this means fairly satisfactory irrigation is obtained. (2) The Baghdad Belt. On the right bank of the Tigris at and below Baghdad there are eleven78 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 miles of date groves; north of the town they become less continuous until at Beled only isolated palms are met with. (3) On the Euphrates Kufa, Kefl, and Kerbela are centres of date-growing, and so is the coun try watered by the Dujeil Canal. Groves alsu occur in patches as far north as Rawa, opposite Ana. The date groves of the Euphrates have suffered from the drying-up of the Hilla branch of the river. The Mesopotamian date is inferior in quality to those of Egypt and Algiers, but varieties from these countries could he introduced into Mesopotamia. The finest are said to come from Mendali, near the Persian frontier, where satisfactory irrigation is obtained by a canal taking off from the Ab-i-Gunjir. Dates are not only the staple diet of the Arab, but are used as fodder for cattle and for the manufacture of a native spirit called ' araq. ' The packing is done by women and desert Arabs in temporary huts built along the river banks. The fruit is packed damp, and evaporation causes the crystal lization of the sugar present ; none is added. Wood for date-boxes is imported. The total crop in 1913, if we estimate it as being twice the export, would be nearly 128,000 tons. The average crop is probably about 91,500 tons; much higher figures have been given, but these are probably over-estimates. The date palm supplies timber for building and fur niture, but it is difficult to fell, and too valuable to be freely cut. The foot stumps furnish fuel and fibre from which cordage is made, while the leaves are used for matting, beds, and thatch. Dry branches are also used as firewood. Rice of coarse quality is grown in large and increas ing quantities in Irak, where its importance is second only to that of the date palm. It is also grown, but to a considerably smaller extent, in Upper Mesopotamia. As has already been said 1 , rice is grown on the lowestMesopotamia] PRODUCTS 70 of the slopes which descend from the raised river channels to the swamps. It is very difficult to form any accurate estimate of the area under rice. At a very rough estimate it may be said that, in the Basra vilayet, it amounts to about 100,000 acres, from which the total production averages about 195,000 tons. Rice is cultivated in the land bordering upon the marshes of the Tigris below Amara, and in the marshy districts of the Euphrates between Hilla and Suk esh-Sheyukh. For the rice fields of the vilayet the markets are Amara and Qual'at Salib. The figures of production of rice in the vilayet of Mosul are very uncertain; it is all sold within the coun try at absurdly low prices. It is impossible to say what the production of rice to the acre is; the natives have the vaguest ideas of measurements, and their estimates show great varia tions. In any case the yield is very heavy, and the rice tribes are by far the wealthiest. Rice is the rival of wheat and barley, and, though primarily grown for home consumption, is exported to an in creasing extent; 67,000 tons were loaded at Basra in 1912. Wheat and hnrley are the chief crops of northern Mesopotamia, that is, of the vilayet of Mosul and the Mutessariflik of Zor, but the difficulties of tiransport have hitherto rendered impossible any considerable export from these districts, and much of the crops is at present wasted. In the vilayet of Mosul the desert wastes alternate with large fertile valleys, and the rainfall is in general sufficient to bring the crops to maturity without irrigation; consequently, when adequate means of transport are available the cultiva tion of these cereals should be profitable. On the Upper Euphrates barley and wheat are not much grown between Feluja and Birijik, owing to the difficulties of irrigation. North of Birijik conditions are more favourable, and the lack of water is to some extent overcome by the use of pumps. Consequently,80 ECONOMIC CONDTTTONS [No. 02 wheat is grown there in larger quantities, and there is a considerable traffic in grain down-stream from Birijik. In Irak the wheat crop is of less importance than dates, rice, and barley, and consequently suffers from a certain amount of neglect, but wheat and barley are sown on the banks of the rivers and canals where the ground is dry enough to admit of sowing before the rain comes, and is clear of floods before harvest-time in April and May. There are grain stores at many places on the Tigris and Euphrates, but these, as a general rule, do not adequately protect the grain stored in them against the weather. Mesopotamia!! wheat is red, and of a hard quality ; only small quantities are exported, as it is almost all converted into flour and consumed in the country. The barley is generally of excellent quality, and if properly cleaned would command the best prices in the markets of the world. Before the war the trade in grain from Mesopotamia suffered from the insufficiency of internal transport, and the consequent deterioration of the grain before shipment, and also from the custom of deliberately mixing dirt with the grain in order to in crease the weight, a practice which rendered Mesopo- tamian grain unpopular in the market. Other cereals are maize, millet, and sesame, which belong mostly to Irak, and are grown almost entirely for home consumption, though there is some export of millet and sesame. Flour milling of a primitive kind is carried on all over Mesopotamia, wherever corn is grown. In Bagh dad there are over 100 mills, and Mosul boasts more than 300. The only modern mill is that at Baghdad, recently owned by tKe Turkish Government. Two kinds of cotton are at present grown, one from native seed and the other from Bombay seed. The latter is of much better quality, but does not easily work off the native carding instrument, and is there fore little grown. Egyptian seed has given good results, but is not popular commercially.Mesopotamia.! PRODUCTS 81 The best cotton is grown in the Khanikin. districts; it is also grown on a small scale at Shakhlawa, near Eania, and in the irrigated plain near Feish Khabur; the total area under cultivation for cotton is probably not much more than 1,000 acres. The- product is used for stuffing pillows and coarse clothing; none is exported. The possibilities of cotton- growing in Mesopotamia are discussed on p. 129. Tobacco is grown round Kerbela and Nejef, in the Diala valley, and in the north-east of Mosul vilayet, where the chief collecting centres are Golan, Keui San- jak, and Taktak; the two latter stand on the Lesser Zab, and send tobacco down that river and the Tigris to Baghdad. The Public Debt Administration has a monopoly of the manufacture and sale of tobacco, which business it manages through the Tobacco Monopoly, or Regie, whose officials supervise the cultivation and col lect the taxes. Of the crop the State gets approxi mately 1 /6th, the proprietor 4/6ths, and the cultivator ] /6th, The total output is probably about 1,550,000 kg. per annum. Phis output could be increased with expert instruction and more intensive cultivation. Baghdad, Mosul, and Suleimanie are the distri buting centres. Other important crops are opium and hemp, both successfully grown in the Belikh Delta, north of Rakka, luhiyeh, a kidney pea cultivated in Irak on river banks and land liable to floods, and mash, a sort of vetch or pea (sometimes described as a lentil), which grows in damp, sandy plains, and requires little water. Fruits and Vegetables. —The variations of climate between Diarbekr in the north and Basra in the south are well illustrated by the wide range of fruits pro duced. Grapes, olives, figs, melons, pomegranates, apricots, and apples are common to all parts of the country; the rest are confined to one or more tracts. It is noteworthy that at Mosul, w T here the climate is milder than in the foothills of the Taurus, the orange appears for the first time; other fruits belong essenti ally to the South European type, e.g., pears, pistachio [285—66] &amp;82 ECONOMIC CONDITION'S 'No. 92 nuts, almonds, raisins, walnuts, quinces, and cherries. Proceeding southward other fruits appear—mulberries and citrons at Baghdad and Basra—while the orange becomes universal. Orchards line the banks of the Euphrates continuously from Ana to Hit, and the fruit trees in and about Baghdad are said to number 130,000, mainly figs, pomegranates, plums, and apricots. Below Baghdad the date palm predominates. There is hardly less variety among the vegetables, which include onions, radishes, beetroot, cucumber, cab bage, carrots, tomatoes, artichokes, lettuces, potatoevS, &amp;c. The potato is a recent introduction. Except in the immediate neighbourhood of large towns, fruit and vegetables were, before the war, culti vated only for the needs of tenants and owners, and were treated as an entirely negligible quantity, being neither assessed to revenue by Government nor to rent by owners, who were usually satisfied by presents in kind in lieu of rent. A tax was imposed by the Turkish Government on vegetables brought to market in the big towns, and owners in like manner demanded a share of vegetables and fruit grown within easy reach of markets; elsewhere fruit and vegetables as agricultural assets were ignored. Under the British occupation efforts have been made to stimulate vegetable produc tion in southern Mesopotamia with very satisfactory results. Timber. —Chesney, describing his journey up the Tigris, speaks of that river as flowing between high, well-wooded banks. To-day, the only trees remaining in Irak are date palms, tamarisks, and a few poplars, which provide a scanty supply of fuel. Northern Meso potamia has occasional oak-groves, especially east of Suleimanie; the slopes of the Kurdish hills were for merly well-wooded, but are being stripped ; and the herds of goats kept by the Kurds do much damage to young growth. Pistachio trees, poplars, planes, and sycamores are found, but the staple tree is the stunted oak, chief!v valuable for gall-nuts. Large areas of tamarisk shrub line the middle course of the Euphrates.Mesopotamiaj PRODUCTS 83 It is known that in ancient days trees abounded in Mesopotamia, and the reafforestation of Irak will no doubt form part of any plan for the regeneration of the country, both as a means of assisting the control of floods, and as an important adjunct to the schemes for increasing the humidity of the soil. Animals. —Live stock is the principal or sole source of wealth of many of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia. There are, however, no reliable statistics as to the number of animals or their distribution before the war, and the following table should be taken merely as a rough indication :— Cattle Buffaloes Horses Donkeys Mules Camels Sheep Goats Baghdad. Basra. Zor. 155,000 120,000 10,000 HO,000 80,000 4,000 85,000 88,000 1,700 100,000 110,000 8,500 4,000 # # 95,000 125,000 4,000 2,100,000 1,200,000 450,000 4,000 Mosul. The wholly nomad Arabs in the western desert, the Upper Mesopotamian plains, and the drier parts of Irak keep and breed camels, horses, sheep, some goats, and donkeys. The semi-nomad Arabs own camels, horses, cattle (in proportions varying with the nature of the district they frequent), sheep, some goats, and donkeys. The settled cultivators own cattle (buffaloes in the marshes), sheep, goats, donkeys, horses, and a few camels. In the hill country of northern Mesopo tamia the semi-nomadic or nomadic Kurds breed sheep, goats, cattle, horses, and mules. The settled popula tion of the hills and the edges of the plain own chiefly cattle (including buffaloes), sheep, goats, and mules. [285—66] G 284 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ^0.92 The camel may be said in general to be characteristic of the dry, uncultivated plains (desert or steppe). The nomad tribes who breed camels depend on them lor travel in the desert, for milk (the basis of the nomad's diet), and hair for cloth-weaving. Different types of camel are bred, suitable respectively for riding and for transport purposes. Good breeds of Arab horses are found both in northern and southern Mesopotamia, though they are said not to be up to the standard of the best breeds ot the Nejd and Syria. The Kurdish horses are small, but are said to be strong and serviceable. Sheep are kept in immense numbers by the Arabs. In Irak the most common breed is the arabi or sheffal, yielding a fine wool. The awassi breed, a cross between the arabi and the coarse-fleeced karadi sheep of the hill country, is found in the plains of Upper Mesopotamia. Goats are chiefly kept by the hill tribes. The common type is the mohair, which yields a fine silky wool of considerable commercial value. Cattle are found in the plains, chiefly in the better- watered grazing grounds near the rivers. They are used for ploughing, irrigation, and draught work, as well as for their milk and hides. The hill cattle are generally small. Buffaloes are characteristic of the marshes', where they are kept in great numbers, and form the main wealth of the inhabitants. In parts of Mosul buffaloes are used for agricultural work. Donkeys are very common in Irak. The ordinary breed (black or dark brown) is much used for trans port and other labour. A large white riding donkey is also bred. There is very little mule breeding among the Arabs, the mules found in the plains coming for the most part from the hill country of Persia and Kurdistan. In some districts mules are used for work in the fields. The supply of fodder for cattle in Mesopotamia pre sents considerable difficulties, as the grass which is found in early spring soon dries up in the hot weather. The problem 'of feeding their flocks nnd herds is at theMesopotamia j PRODUCTS 85 root of the nomadic habit of the Arab, who solve it by migration to the submontane districts. Amongst the settled tribes green barley, rice, straw, millet, and dates are used as food for cattle. Lucerne is grown to a small extent in the neighbourhood of Basra, and flourishes in the climate of Mesopotamia; it is deserving of a much wider cultivation, both on account of its value as a forage crop and also because, being a leguminous crop, it w T ould prove beneficial to the soil. If Mesopo tamia is to become the home of a settled population, early attention should be given to devising a means to provide fodder in the hot weather, especially for sheep. (c) Land I enure In Mesopotamia, nominally, at any rate, the same system of land tenure was in force as exists throughout the Turkish Empire; that is to say,all lands and build ings were divided into one of five classes of property according to their situation and the use to which they were put. The whole system of land tenure in Turkey has been dealt with in Handbook No. 46, Turkey in Europe, and all that is necessary here is to refer to the incidence of that system in Mesopotamia. In the immediate vicinity of towns like Basra, and to a less degree in provincial centres like Amara, the Turkish system of land tenure was effective. Beyond these limits Mesopotamia is still a tribal country; that is to say, the tribes claim a prescriptive right to the occupation of large areas, cultivated or uncultivated, the latter being the undisturbed haunt of nomadic tribes, or of the nomadic sections of half-settled tribes. Almost the whole of the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad are apportioned in this manner. Theoretically the Turks ignored tribal claims; in practice they were forced to 1 acknowledge them wherever the tribes were grouped into large and powerful units, as was the case on the River Tigris. In such cases they found it impos sible to lease lands to any but the tribal sheikhs. The sheikh thus occupied much more than his nominal pos-86 ECONOM[C CONDITIONS [No. 92 seasion a« tenant holding from the State. He was the representative of a corporate right, which the State could not disregard. Where the tribes were split into many sections, as was the case more especially upon the Euphrates, the Turkish Government attempted to set aside their tribal right to certain specified lands. The result was acute discontent, which kept the Euphrates valley in a constant state of disturbance, and recently had reduced ordered government there to a mere pre tence. On the Tigris, however, there has been a certain amountof assimilation of cultivators belonging to other tribes, a fact which suggests the possibility of a gradual assimilation of the Arab tribes in Mesopotamia. A very considerable portion of Mesopotamia (it is said, as much as one-third of the cultivable area) was owned by the late Sultan Abdul Ha mid; this estate was known as the Da'irat es-Saniyeh, and was managed by a committee in Baghdad. By degrees the most pros perous portions of Mesopotamia had been by some means or other acquired by the late Sultan; and in 1904 the Saniyeh enlarged its activities by acquiring the whole stock and assets of the Oman Ottoman branch of the Ministry of Marine, and beginning, to trade on the Tigris. The activities of the Saniyeh were not, however, popular in Turkey; and it is stated that the fact that Abdul tlamid had become possessed of so much of Mesopotamia had much to do with his down fall. After he had been deposed, the property form ing the Da'irat es-Saniyeh was transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and was nominally administered as State property for the benefit of the Exchequer. (3) Minerals Little information is available with regard to the minerals of Mesopotamia. Lack of means of transport, insecurity, and other causes have combined to hinder their exploitation, and the deposits which have been worked have been dealt with by more or less primitive methods. Scientific examination of mineral fields has* Mesopotamia] MINKRALS 87 only been carried out in a very tew districts, and the statements as to the existence of oil are largely based upon conclusions arrived at from a knowledge of the general geological structure ol Mesopotamia, supported by the uncertain evidence of surface indications of oil or bitumen in different places. In these circumstances it is impossible to do more than indicate the regions in which minerals are reported to exist. There is apparently a good deal of borax in the desert north-west of Baghdad. Building-storie is rare in Irak. It is reported that below Baghdad stone is found only at Samawa, and at the Jebel Sinam, about 30 miles south-west ot Basra. Limestone can be quarried at Hit, and accessories for building, such as sand, shingle, and lime, can be ob tained on the edges of the desert. In Upper Mesopo tamia the principal quarries are those in the hills near Mosul, where a hard limestone and a soft marble are obtained. Building-stone can be found in the Euphrates valley between Feheme and Ana. and further north at Deir ez-Zor and Ivishla Madan. Basalt is common in the hill country south of Diarbekr, and in parts of the northern Jezireh plain. Lime, plaster, and marble are found in Kurdistan along the Turko Persian borderland. Coal is worked at Nasale, near Kifri, and there is said to be a good deal in the hills near Halebja, south- cast of Suleimanie. A German newspaper stated on January 11, 1918, that important beds of coal had been discovered 90 kilometres north-east ot Bagh dad, not far from the left bank of the Tigris, and that this coal had been used on Tigris steamers with excel lent results. . North of Mosul deposits of coal exist over a iairly wide area. They are reported in the Dohuk district, at TTarbol and Slieranis, north of Zakho, and further east, in the country north of Amadia. The quantity in the neighbourhood of Harbol is said to be large, but the quality is at present poor. 1 Wirtschaftszcitung der Zentrahndchtc.88 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. os Brown coal has been notieed in the neighbourhood of Mardin. Coyyer is reported from the Shemdinan and Oramar districts of central Kurdistan, and also in the Dohuk district, south-west of Amadia. Gold was worked in the past in the Bohtan valley, but the enterprise was abandoned for want of trans port. Gypsum of poor quality abounds along the Persian foothills from the Persian Gulf to the neighbourhood of Kirkuk, and is also found on the edge of the Arabian Desert, where the deposits have been worked to a small extent. Iron ore is found in the Sergusk hills, to the north of Amadia; it used to be worked, but the mine was abandoned owing to insecurity. It is said that there are large quantities of the ore. Other deposits are reported east of Amadia and in the Dohuk district. Iron is also found in the Bohtan valley. Lead occurs in the neighbourhood of Amadia, and in the valleys of the Bohtan and Zab. It is said that there are also valuable deposits in the hills south and south-west of Diarbekr. Oil and Bitumen. 1 —There are extensive belts of coun try in Mesopotamia where the presence of oil is known or suspected, but the examination of those belts is still very incomplete. Thorough geological examination and testing have' been carried out by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company near Shushter in Arabistan, and there seems to have been careful inspection of the country round Kasr-i-Shirin, on the Persian side of the fron tier near Khanikin. So far as such investigation goes, the results are said to be promising. Elsewhere there has been thorough examination only at a few scattered points. The petroliferous areas may be conveniently considered in three main belts:— (a) The belt between Kirkuk and the Persian Gulf. —This belt, extending north-westwards to Kirkuk from 1 The history of the oil concessions in Mesopotamia 1889-191/) summarised abovo, p. 34.Mesopotamia! MINERALS 80 the Gulf, is certainly petroliferous in some parts, and may be in others also. One large section (theShushter- Ahwaz—Ramuz district) falls outside the boundaries of Mesopotamia, and is dealt with in No. Persia. Exploitation work has been done in the Kirkuk Mendali—Kasr-i-Shirin area, north of Baghdad, and though production has not been attempted on any scale in this region, some experts are inclined to think that it may prove richer than the Shushter area. It lies on the line of the caravan route, between Baghdad and Kermanshah, and is also easily accessible from Mosul. Down to the outbreak of war, the wells on the Turkish side of the frontier had not been exploited b\ modern methods. The springs were apparently owned by the Turkish Government, and were leased to con tractors. The oil was collected in skins from pits and was carried by donkeys to the refineries. There are stills at Kirkup, Tuza Khurmatli. and Mandali. The yield has so far been very small; the Kirkuk wells, in 1910, were producing only about 130 gallons per day, and those at Tuza Khurmatli about 150. The refined oil was used, according to quality, for illumination, lubrication, or as a specific for mange. (h) The Middle Tigris belt—Th\s belt extends up the river from the Fatha gorge in the Jebel Hamrin almost to Mosul. At present oil is worked only at Kaiyara (Guyajra), about 50 miles south of Mosul by river and 40 miles by road. 1 here are oil oozings in the warm springs of Hammam Ali (15 miles south of Mosul), and at El-Hadhr, and at the Fethah gorge. It is possible that the whole line oi the Hamrin hills is petroliferous. The economic prospects of this area, are quite uncertain, and in 1910 the output of a primitive refinery at Kaivara was insignificant. (c) The Euphrates belt—A petroliferous area ex tends along the river from a few miles south of Hit to some distance above Deir ez-Zor. The economic pros pects here, too, are quite uncertain. Hitherto the only important exploitation of this area has been at Hit.K (' () X O M r (M' 0 X I) r TI () N s [No. 92 Before the war there were five bitumen springs in this neighbourhood. In 1909 these were stated to be capable of an output of 2,000 donkey-loads a day, but the actual production was probably considerably less. Owing to lack of transport the bitumen was used locally only, chiefly for pitching boats, bridges, &amp;c. There is now a refinery and petroleum store at Hit. Orpiment was at one time mined in the Julamuk region, but the enterprise was abandoned owing to lack of transport. Ozokerit is said to be obtainable in large quantities at Gulraman in the Dohuk district. Potash is found in the deserts. Salt is produced by evaporation from numerous salt- fields covering large areas both in Irak and in upper Mesopotamia. The inhabitants of the country dis tricts are allowed to collect what salt they need for their own use, but the supply of salt for the town markets is in the hands of the Public Debt Adminis tration. There is also a group of saltfields in central Kurdistan, on the lower Bohtan. Rock salt is found at Taza Khurmali, south of Kirknk. Tin is reported from the Shemdinan and Oramar districts of central Kurdistan. (4) Manufacture The manufactures of Mesopotamia are few and of ;i primitive kind. They fall into tw T o main categories; first, those which are incidental to the simple exist ence of the pastoral or agricultural Arab; and secondly, those which are designed to meet the love of ease and ostentation which is very strongly developed in the Per sian, and is to a less extent a characteristic of the town- dwelling Arab. In the former category may be placed the milling, tanning, cloth-making, boat-building, and brick-making industries, in the latter the manufacture of silk goods, metal-working and the production of araq. With the exception of a military cloth factory belong ing to the Turkish Government at Baghdad. Mesopo-Mesopotamia] MANUFACTURE 91 tamia has no manufacturing industries in which steam is used; indeed the only other steam machinery devoted to industry is that used in the Government flour-mill, the ice factory at Baghdad, and the wool presses at Baghdad, Basra, Kut, and Amara. The chief manu factures and handicrafts are as follows:— Boat-building is carried on at many places on the two rivers, notably at Kale Sale, Shatra el-Muntifik, Nasrie, Suk esh-Sheyukh, and Hit ; at Hit a branch of the bitumen industry is the caulking of boats. Distilling is done on a small scale at Qarareh, on the Tigris near Baghdad. The spirit produced is called araq, and is obtained from dates, other ingredients being aniseed, mastic, cardamoms, and orange-peel. Some distilling is also done at Hilla, but the produce is said to be inferior. Metal-workin.g in gold, silver, and copper is carried on in all the principal towns of Mesopotamia, the Sabian gold and silversmiths of Suk esh-Sheyukh, Amara, and Shatra el-Muntifik being the best. At Amara a speciality is made of inlaying silver with antimony, while Kerbela is chiefly engaged in filigree work and the engraving of mother-of-pearl. Pottery and brick-waking. —Earthenware drinking vessels and water coolers are made at Baghdad, and tiles at Baghdad, Kerbela, and Kasimain. Rough bricks are made all over Mesopotamia, and are either used unburnt or burnt in rough wooden kilns. Sir John Jackson found the native method of making bricks to be the best and cheapest when his firm was constructing the Hindie barrage. Silk and other textiles. —Seventy years ago the culti vation of the silkworm was one of the most important industries in Irak, but the industry suffered from a long period of depression, and only in recent years has a revival taken place. The most important centre of the cultivation of silkworms is Bakuba, and before the war broke out the cultivation of mulberry trees in that district was extending. The quality of the eggs and cocoons produced is very high.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 The weaving of silk is carried on at Baghdad and Mosul. The silk fabrics of Baghdad are famous for their beauty of colouring and workmanship, the best known manufacture being the Ezar, a silk cloak largely worn by native women, and the Abas, an Arab cloak made either of silk or wool and embroidered with silk or gold. The latter are made at several places besides Baghdad, notably at Kerbela, Nejef, Amara, Suk esh-Sheyukh, and Kurna. The reeling of silk is primitive, and the silk is badly yarned. Some silk weaving is also done at Kazimain. Woollen rugs and coarse carpets are manufactuired at Kut, Samawa, and Amara. Other textiles are manufactured in large quantities at Baghdad. These include men s garments. Jackets, veils, shawls, belts, and handkerchiefs, all of fine cotton, wool, or silk, and in addition coarse cotton cloth for the use of the poorer classes, and canvas for tents. Tanning is one of the most solid industries of the country. There are forty tanneries near Muadhdem (a suburb of Baghdad), and others at Kazimain and Mosul. The chief raw materials used are sheep and ' goat skins, buffalo, ox and cow hides, and fox, otter, and stone-marten skins. The industry is in a primitive state, the skins are badly handled, and the leather is only roughly tanned. It is used locally in the manufac ture of boots and shoes, and is also exported to Europe. The industry suffers from the want of good tannin. (C) COMMERCE (1) Domestic (a) Towns Amara, on the left bank of the Tigris, 92| miles above Kurna, is only of importance as a centre for the collection and shipment of cattle and native produce, consisting chiefly of wheat, rice, barley, sesame, wool,Mesopotamia] TOWNS 93 ghee, skins and hides. The population was estimated in 1915 at about 28,000 (mostly Arabs). No statistics of the trade of the town are available. Alon^ the whole river frontage runs an embankment faced with brick, alongside which steamers can lie in a depth ot trom 13-^ feet of water at high and feet at low water seasons. There are no facilities for dealing with cargo. The manufactures of the town consist of Arab cloaks, rugs, and silverware. The town possesses a telegraph office, and is at present the terminus of the metre-gauge railway from Basra. Baghdad lies on the Tigris, 448 miles by river above Kurna. The population, which is very mixed, is estimated at 200,000; the Jews form the largest racial group (about 55,000), aAd the Arabs come next (about 39,000). Before the war the town was connected by telegraph with Basra, Mosul, Kermanshah and Teheran, and with Aleppo, via Feluja and Deir ez -Zor. The town lies on both sides of the river and a bridge of boats 240 yards long connects the two parts of the town. This bridge consists of 24 pontoons moored to both banks and to buoys in the river; a section ot three boats can be swung down-stream to let vessels through. The whole bridge is removed during very high floods. The regular moo ring-place for steamers is on the left bank of the river below the bridge, but a wharf about 200 yards long has recently been constructed on the right bank near the railway station, with which it is connected by a single line of track. This wharf is equipped with two travelling cranes. The depth of the river at low water is from 12 to 15 feet. The streets of the town are narrow and ill-kept; in the better parts there are houses of considerable size, but in the poorer parts the houses are low and are built of unburnt brick, The water supply is taken from the Tigris, and is unfiltered. and there is no modern drainage. Electric light has only been installed since the military occupation of the town by the British army. A horse tramway runs to the north-western suburb of Kazimain.94 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 Baghdad is the chief religious centre 111 Mesopo tamia of the Sunni sect of Mohammedans, and is visited by Sunni Mussulmans from regions as remote as Afghanistan and India. It is also visited by pilgrims from Persia on their way to the shrines at Kerbela and Nejef. It could therefore be used as a starting-point for the commercial penetration of Persia and India. Industrially and commercially, Baghdad is the chief town of Irak and the centre of the trade of Lower Mesopotamia. There are 116 flour-mills worked by horses, besides the steam-driven army mill, formerly owned by the Turkish Government, a cloth factory, an ice factorv, wool presses, and tanneries, and the manu facture 01 silk, cotton, and woollen goods, and canvas, and of earthenware and copper goods is carried on. Baghdad is the centre of the export trade from central Mesopotamia, and receives large quantities of goods sent down-stream from Mosul, or by caravan from Kermanshah in Persia. It is also a distributing centre for the whole of Irak and for Persia via Khanikin. The value of the Persian transit trade may be gathered from the following figures, taken from the Consular Reports:— Year. Exports to Persia.

In 1914 there were only 8 EuropeanMesopotamia] TOWNS 95 business houses of importance in the town; of these 0 were English, 1 Grerman, and 1 Austrian. Statistics are given below (Appendix, Tables L and 11) showing the total export and import trade of Baghdad, with the destination or origin of the goods, and the per centage of trade done by the countries principally con cerned. Basrn has been described in the section on ports (p. 68). Kirknk lies on the main route trom Baghdad to Mosul, 187 miles north of Baghdad. The population is probably 20,000, and is very mixed, Kurds forming the largest portion. The town is a centre ol the culti vation of corn and fruit, and there are numerous flour- mills. It is also the centre of a sheep-rearing district. The chief exports are corn, fruit, gall-nuts, oil, and wood. The chief imports are cotton goods, Kirkuk being the distributing centre for Kurdistan. Knt el-Aviara, on the left bank of the Tigris, 284 miles above Kurna, has a population of about 6,000 Arabs. Before the war the town was the centre of a considerable grain traffic, corn from the Euphrates country bein^ brought up by way of the Shatt el-Hai for distribution in the neighbourhood, as the local crop was not usually sufficient. Large grain stores were owned by the Da'irat es-Saniyeh. Woollen rugs and coarse carpets are manufactured. The town is at pre sent the Eastern terminus of the metre-gauge railway, which has been built by the British army of occupation down-stream from Baghdad. It possesses a telegraph office. The depth of the river at low water is about 5 ft.; there are no facilities for handling cargo. Mosul lies on the right bank of the Tigris, some 230 miles north-west of Baghdad. The population is variouvsly estimated at from 70,000 to 90.000, nearly all Mohammedans. The town possesses a post-office and telegraph. The river, which is about 675 yards broad, is crossed by a bridge of boats. The streets are narrow, undrained lanes, mostly unpaved. The houses are built of sun-dried bricks or of local stoneECONOMIC COXmTIONS [No. 92 set ill gypsum cement. The town is re[)orted to be unsanitary. There are about 200 flour-mills in Mosul, and the town is the centre of trade in corn, fruits, sheep and goats. A considerable amount of weaving is done on hand-looms, other industries being shoemaking, tanning, and metal-working. Mosul is a centre ol trade (1) from Beirut on the Mediterranean by rail to Aleppo and thenoe by mule, camel, or caravan; (2) from the Persian Gulf by river steamer to Baghdad and thence by land; (3) from Samsoun on the Black Sea by mule or waggon transport to Diarbekr and thence by raft down the Tigris; (4) from and to Persia rid Erbil and Rowanduz.

At present the trade of Mosul suffers from the drawbacks of its geographical situation, to which are added the insecurity of the districts thiough which caravans must paws, especially on the routes between Baghdad and Aleppo. In consequence there is hardly any direct dealing with Europe. The building of the Baghdad Railway will no ckmbt stimulate the trade of Mosul and remove the chief obstacle to its com mercial development. Suleimanie is situated 60 miles east by north of Kirkuk, on the Turkish side of the Turko-Persian frontier. No accurate estimate of the population is available. The town consists of about 2,500 houses. It was formerly a large centre of trade with Persia, but in recent years the trade has diminished, partly owing to an imposition of 15 per cent. Customs duty. An important local industry is the manufacture of firearms, especially rifles; about 9,000 are manufac tured per annum. Shoemaking and saddlery are also important occupations.

Interests The interests of Great Britain and India in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia originated with the East India Company, which from the middle of the 17th century onwards possessed established commercial interests there. In the latter part of the I8th century the Pasha of Baghdad was on more than one occasion glad to have the help of the vessels of the East India Company to protect him against the Arabs and others. The rights of British vessels to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates had, however, never been clearly defined, and had been the subject of controversy between London and Constantinople. In recent times there have been persistent efforts on the part of the Turkish Government to whittle down such rights as were possessed by treaty, agreement, or custom by Great Britain and her subjects. 1 These attempts were due 1 The history of the navigation controversy up to 1913 is dealt with in detail above, p. 28. [285—66] H 2100 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS fNo. 92 ])artly to a general desire to limit the interests ot Great Britain in the trade of Mesopotamia, but partly also to the increase in importance of the trade done on the rivers by the Turkish Hamadieh Company, which was owned by the Turkish Civil List, hrom a British point of view, the question became suddenly extremely urgent when the Baghdad Railway Con vention gave the concessionnaires the right to construct harbours at Baghdad and Basra and on the Persian Gulf as an integral part of the railway scheme. It was clear that the control of these harbours, when built, would mean the control of the rivers, and pro bably the ultimate exclusion of Great Britain from the trade of Mesopotamia. Ultimately, in 1913, negotiations were entered into in London between representatives of the British and Turkish Governments, the outcome of which was the grant by the Turkish Government of a concession to Lord Inchcape (the Chairman of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and therefore the repre sentative of the strongest interest in British trade in Mesopotamia). Its principal terms were as follows:— 1. Lord Inchoape was granted (a) The exclusive right of navigation by steamers and the like (with or without barges in tow) on the Tigris from Kurna to Mosul, on the Euphrates from Kurna to Meskene, on the Shatt el-Arab, and on their navigable tribu taries and canals, for a period of 60 years in the first instance, and thereafter for successive periods of 10 years unless and until determined by the Turkish Government by 5 years' notice. (/&gt;) The right to carry out dredging and conservancy works over the waters included in the concession (provided that such works should not interfere with irrigation), and to make the regulations necessary for the proper control of navigation. The Turkish Government on its part undertook not to permit the use of the rivers for irrigation to the prejudice of navigation.Mesopotamia] BH I I ISH. IN I KliES 1 S 101 2. The concession was without prejudice to the rights of Lynch Brothers, 1 which were to remain unimpaired. 3. Lord Inchcape undertook to form a Company under Ottoman law to exercise the rights granted by the concession, the Turkish Government and Lord Inchcape having each the right to nominate half of the directors of the Company, and the shares of the Company to be held approximately equally by the representatives of English and Turkish interests. 2 4. The Company was to take over the vessels of the Turkish Government (the Hamadie Company) en gaged in the trade of the Tigris and Euphrates, together with that Company's lands, buildings, plant, &amp;c. The rights of Lynch Brothers which the concession confirmed and acknowiedged were the following : (a) The right to run two steamboats, each towing not more than two barges, under the British flag on the Tigris, Euphrates, and Shatt el-Arab, with a further boat flying the British flag in reserve to replace either of the above vessels if out of service. (b) The right to run one steamboat, also with barges in tow, on the rivers under the Ottoman flag. (c) Methods of Economic Penetration* The struggle between German and British trade in Mesopotamia is particularly instructive and interest- 3 For the history of this firm, see above, p. 39. 2 In the Anglo-German Convention initialled in London, June 15, 1914, His Majesty's Government undertook not to oppose the acquisition by the Baghdad Railway Company of 40 per cent, of the share capital to be allotted to Turkish interests, i.e., 20 per cent, of the whole capital of the Company. 8 A digest of information contained in (a) Notes by Sir George Lloyd, K.C.I.E., annexed to a report on the Economic Situation in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamian Markets from Lieut.-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.LE., dated July 24, 1916. {h) A report dated June 15, 1917, by Messrs. R. E. Holland and J. H. Wilson to the Indian Government on the prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia.102 ECONOMIC CONDITION'S [No. 96 ing, for it was of the nature of a duel between the commercial methods of the two countries, since England for more than a hundred years had had a practical monopoly of the sea-borne trade ot Mesopotamia. Germany's interest in the commercial development of Turkey dates back as far as 1888, when M. Kaulla, acting oil behalf of the Wiirttembcrgische Vereins- bank and the Deutsche Bank, obtained the concession over the railway from Haidar-Pasha to Ismidt with the right to extend it to Angora (300 miles), ihis was the beginning of a process which culminated in 1903 in the grant to German interests of the Baghdad Rail way Concession. So far as Mesopotamia was con cerned, however, it was not till 1906 that German activities made themselves seriously felt. At that time European trade with Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf was carried almost entirely in British bottoms. The Consular returns show that, excluding lurkish sailing vessels, out of the 233 vessels from European waters which entered Basra in 1904 and 308 in 190.3, vessels living the British flag numbered 210 and 2^3 respectively, the majority of the remainder being French. In April 1906 the Hamburg-Amerika Steamship Company announced its intention of running a service between Europe and the Persian Gulf. At that date German trade with Basra was worth annually about £145,000, as against British and Indian trade of a value of about £3,000,000. The first steamer arrived in the Gulf in August, 1906, and at the same time an agent was installed at Bushire. The first noticeable effect was the shipment-of Belgian sugar from Ant werp by the Hamburg-Amerika line at a freight rate of 20s, per ton. Tn consequence the British lines, which had previously charged 37 .9, per ton of 15 cwt., had to reduce their rate. Partly owing to the regularity of their sailings, the German line began to attract trade from the British almost at once, and it was stated in 1907 that though the outward trade was run at a loss the Germans wereMesopotamia] ECONOMIC PENETRATION making progress with cargo for Europe. German commercial travellers soon began to appear at Bagh dad, and were without doubt welcomed, as it was lelt that the British lines had abused the monopoly which they held, and moreover German goods were proving popular in a market where cheapness is of more importance than quality. The most important branch of British trade in Mesopotamia has for many years been the trade in Manchester goods. In 1907 the Germans attacked this trade, first by making Manchester a port of call, and secondly by introducing a German traveller for an Anglo-German firm with instructions to push his German goods first, only offering his British goods as a last resort. Every effort was made by the German agent to the Hamburg-Amerika Company to conceal the amount of trade which was being done. The result of the first year's working was that Germany had certainly made a loss, but that three of the British lines engaged in the trade had reduced their rates from 305. to 20s. per 40 cubic teet ot space. 1 Nevertheless the German line was still disposed to cut rates, and was more liberal in the matter of weights. Within the country their methods of advertising were admitted to be superior to the British, and they were beginning to make headway with German imitations of Manchester goods. By the end of the year 1907-8 it was seen that the homeward cargo carried in German bottoms had doubled, and that they had captured practically the whole of the continental trade to Mesopotamia. The result of three years' trading showed that the Hamburg-Amerika line was prepared to face a loss over an extended period, provided that they could claim 'As an illustration of the effect of German competition, it is remarkable that in 1907 the freight for general cargo carried in a British ship from Manchester and from Antwerp, both in the same bottom, was respectively £1 las. 2d. per ton from the British port and €1 per ton from the Belgian port.104 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ^0.92 a vested interest in the trade of the Gulf, and it was upon that basis that they began to take an interest in the buoying of the Shatt el-Arab and the navigation of the Euphrates. By the autumn of 1913, in spite of the tact that the respective tonnages of British (or Indian) and German vessels entering and clearing at Basra showed a preponderance in favour of British lines ot not less than 5 to 1, it was clear that the German line was getting stronger. In spite ot organised etfort to combat the increase of the German trade in Belgian sugar, more than 50 per cent, of the imports ot sugar arrived in German bottoms. The German line had secured a portion of the import of Manchester goods and was constantly shipping produce from the Gulf to London and Red Sea ports. Baghdad Jews were beginning to do business in Hamburg and Germany, and it was stated that the German line had bought up some of the vessels of the Strick line, one ot the most important in the trade of the Gulf. By the end of 1913 the position had become so serious to British shipping interests that the shipping lines concerned came to an agreement with the Hamburg- Amerika line in defence of their own interests. The terms included {a) an agreement of freight rates from Europe to the Gulf, and (b) an agreement that German lines should not load at English ports. Information goes to show that these terms were practically dictated to the British lines as to beaten enemies. 1 his was admitted by Lord Inchcape in a letter to the India Office dated December 29, 1913, in which he wrote : ' If the British lines had not come to terms with the Ham- burg-Amerika line it would have been impossible for them to maintain a position in the trade/' It may well be asked by what methods a single Ger man line had been able in barely seven years to bring- about this result. The usual reply of ' German sub sidies' is insufficient, for the French Government has for many years heavily subsidised the Messageries Maritimes line to Australia, and yet British lines haveMesopotamia! ECONOMIC PKN K 1 HA 1 ION 105 made perfectly successful headway against it. 1 he German line began operations with everything against it. It had no large contracts to support it. The British lines, on the other hand, had the assistance oi large Manchester freight contracts, a large Marseilles sugar-carrying trade, the carrying trade w T ith India, the mail contract, and a highly profitable pilgrim traffic. Sir George Lloyd's report attributes the German suc cess to State organization of production and transit, and in particular to the so-called ' through rate system.'' The methods pursued are as follows:— During the early years of the invasion of any area a direct subsidy is given by the German Government to the German line, sufficient to enable it to cut rates and underquote its competitors throughout the area. It can thus draw away traffic from competing lines, and also flood the invaded markets with cheap German goods. The line works in connection with a trading house established in the invaded area. This house arranges for the distribution and sale of cargoes which come unconsigned, and collects export by means ol a low rate of return freight. The object of all this is to per suade the competing lines to enter into a rate agree ment. As soon as this has been secured, the German direct subsidy is replaced by an indirect subsidy sys tem, known as the ' through-rate system, which is designed to enable shipping companies ostensibly to observe their rate agreement, but in practice to under quote their rivals whenever they choose. As the out come of a scientific organization of land and sea transit, through-rates can be quoted for the whole jour- nev, and if necessary a reduction is made on the freight charges over that part of the journey which is not affected by the agreement {e-.cj., on the railway charges for conveying the goods to the port of loading). If there is any loss on the working out of the transaction as a whole it is apportioned as between the State Rail ways and the Shipping Company to that part of the transit which can carry it without injury. Thus, whileECONOMIC CONDITIONS iNo. 9!i competing lines have to work to a fixed rate, the German rate is flexible, and can be adjusted to suit the requirements of the situation from time to time. Similarly, the ' through-rate system can be used by the Germans to circumvent the agreement not to load at English ports. The London merchant is offered through terms from London to Basra by the agent of a line allied to the Hamburg-Amerika line, and ships of that line collect cargo in the port of London, and trans port it to Hamburg or Antwerp for trans-shipment. The London merchant will benefit by a lower rate of freight, but he is providing the Germans with the means of ultimately substituting German-made goods for his own commodities. It will thus be seen that the ' through-rate system,' worked in conjunction with rate agreements, is the chief weapon of the German competitive policy, and it follows that every effort should be concentrated) on refusing to make rate agreements with German lines, even if as an alternative a subsidy of the British lines engaged in the trade over a period of years should become a necessity. In a report made to the Advisory Committee on Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade, after a visit to Mesopotamia in 1907, Sir George Lloyd pointed out various other methods by which the Ger mans had secured trade. These may be summarised as follows:— (1) The Germans realised the fact that the main demand in the East was for cheap goods of low quality. (2) They closely studied native habits and language, and made personal acquaintance with their customers, so that they could safely offer longer credits than their rivals. (3) They were willing to deal in any and every article, to take small orders, and to have new patterns made to please customers. (4) They obtained more elaborate show-cases and ranges of samples than the English.Mesopotamia] ECONOMIC PENETRATION 10/ (5) They quoted in local currency, written in Arabic, and made full use of the natural aptitude ot the Armenian and Jew for commercial transactions. (6) They were able, whatever the reason, to offer lower rates of freight by German ships than British merchants could offer by British lines. Sir George Lloyd also suggested the following rea sons for the failure of British firms to cope with foreign competition:— (1) The British traders, satisfied with the profits which they were making in the cotton trade, and in the export of native products, would not take up small lines of new business, or experiment in the introduc tion of cheap goods at a small margin ol profit. (2) British merchandise was imitated shamelessly and openly. (3) The British shipper and importer, whose deal ings were mainly with Baghdad, appeared not to recog nise fully that the volume of trade in Baghdad was largely at the mercy of the prevailing influences in Basra. Latterly, however, there had been a tendency on the part of the consignors to despatch wares to Basra for sale there in the event of a favourable market, or for despatch to Baghdad, if expedient. (4) British firms overlooked the fact that cheaper Continental manufactures would not be easy to dislodge if they acquired a footing in Mesopotamia, and might in time compete with British wares in Persia also. (5) Dealers in the Baghdad market complained that English manufacturers would not send samples of cot ton clothing to meet the demand for gaudy designs and colouring. Sir George Lloyd recommended that British mer chants should strengthen their position by more general trading, setting aside for a few years a portion ol their profits for the purpose of the trade in hardware, fancy goods, and quincaillerie. They should insist upon cheap, low-class goods being manufactured for them, and, wherever possible, should co-operate in keeping the supply of country produce for export in British108 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS hands. Baghdad might be made an almost exclusively British market if the trading were all-round trading instead of being based, as formerly, on Manchester goods alone. Travellers should be sent out to report on local requirements, and catalogues printed in Arabic should be circulated. The experience gained by selling small quantities of cheap goods in this market would be very valuable as enabling firms to obtain extensive knowledge of the methods, currency, demands, &amp;c., of the market, and to get in touch with the small traders, [fraudulent imitation might be prevented by some sys tem of standard trade-mark. Advertisements should be printed in Arabic, in bright colours, with sketches oi Eastern subjects in illustration of articles on sale. Every business communication should be in a language suitable to the country dealt with. Attention should be paid to the Constantinople market. The native buyer from provincial towns visits Constantinople annually to buy his year's stock, and is apt to deal with large wholesale establishments maintained by Germans, because he does not know his way about while in the capital, and finds it easier to buy all his supplies under one roof. Facilities should be given to buyers to see samples before they place their orders. Finally, British transport communications with the Persian Gulf should be maintained in an effective and satisfactory condition. High rates lor ocean and river freight have handi capped British trade in the past.

No returns of this trade which would be of anv value as a guide are ob tainable; (b) the considerable trade between Mesopo tamia and Persia via Khanikin and Kermanshah, some particulars of which are given on p. 94, under the trade of Baghdad. It is not claimed that the figures are either accurate or reliable; for instance, the method ot arriving at the value of the import of cotton goods was altered in 1908, and from that date onwards these goods are priced 30 per cent, higher. As cotton goods normally form over 40 per cent, of the imports, the alteration has an important bearing on the retuins, but owing to the inefliciency of the 1 urkish ( ustoms House system at Rasra, it was impossible to obtain accurate returns there of the volume of trade, and the figuies given were to a large extent obtained tiom piivate sources. Furthermore, any examination of the con ditions of foreign trade in Mesopotamia, and the important Persian transit trade, is rendered difficult by the absolute lack of official information. 1 urkish customs statistics are too inaccurate to be of much value, and the information given in the British Consular Reports for Basra, is meagre. Com-no ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 pa rati ve statistics as between Great Britain and her competitors are not given there at all, and the effect of German competition upon British trade is not discussed, though this has been the great subject of interest and discussion among politicians and the local trading community from 1907 onwards. The figures given are, however, useful as showing (1) the marked development of Mesopotamian trade during the period immediately preceding the war, and (2) the impetus given to trade by the revolution of 1908, and by the entry on a large scale of Germany into the trade of the country in 1906. Tn the period 1904-13, the years 1905, 1906, 1907, and 1910, were normal; 1904, 1909, and 1913, were ab normally bad, the first two owing to bad harvests or low water in the rivers, and 1913 owing to the disloca tion caused by the Balkan wars; the harvest of 1911 was so exceptionally good as to affect that and the following year, and traders further benefited in 1911 by exceptionally high prices. The very large increase of imports in 1913 was due to the construction of the Baghdad Railway, which caused the imports of iron and steel goods to rise from an average of £34,000 for the period 1909-12 to £1.207,882 for 1913. A large proportion both of the export and import trade through Basra is consigned from or destined for Baghdad, as is shown by the following figures taken from the Consular returns :— Baghdad.

A very important quantity of the trade at Baghdad annually consists of imports to and exports from Persia rid Khanikin. The chief imports to Persia from Turkey, as given in the trade returns for Ker- manshah (almost all of which pass through Baghdad), consist of sugar, tea, cotton goods, indigo, and tobacco, of which over 75 per cent, normally come from Great Britain or India. The chief exports from Persia to Turkey are carpets, gums, silk, opium, and skins. Im ports to Persia normally average about £1.000.000, and exports from Persia about £250,000. The following table, taken from the Consular Reports, gives approximate returns of the share in the trade of Mesopotamia enjoyed by Germany. Russia, and the United States from 1906 to 1913.

The export trade consisted very largely of grain, seeds, and dates. Imports were sugar, iron and steel, cheap glassware, soap, provisions, matches, and German imitations of Manchester goods. In 1912 and 1013 the imports included material for the Baghdad Rail- wav. The value for 1913 was probably not less than £900,000. Russian trade also increased, but to a less extent, the exports being chiefly dates, skins, carpets, silkware, and ghee, and the imports oil, glass, wood, provisions, and furniture. The imports from the United States con sist almost entirely of oil, for which no figures are available. The exports were dates, millet, liquorice, seeds, and carpets. Other countries which have made progress in trade with Mesopotamia are Belgium, Austria, Italy, and Japan. Belgian imports came almost entirely in Ger man bottoms, and trade was nearly all confined to sugar, and iron and steel. Austria made steady pro gress in wool, linen, and silk goods, hardware, hosiery, &amp;c. Japan was sending silk and cotton goods, tea and cheap fancy goods. Since war broke out she has largely increased her trade in the country in every direction, and will prove an important competitor in the future. The trade of France in Mesopotamia has decreased considerably, her large import of sugar having been replaced by Belgian sugar. The bulk of the trade of Mesopotamia is still in the hands of Great Britain and India, but British trade has tended more and more to confine itself to special lines, and Germany has taken full advantage of the failure of traders to study and supply the expanding demands of a country advancing towards civilisation. The staple trade from Great Britain was in Man chester goods, but this was being persistently and suc cessfully attacked by Germany; only in machinery was Great Britain making really good progress against all competitors. India takes large quantities of Mesopo-Mesopotamia] FOREIGN TRADE 113 tamian exports of dates, ghee, opium, horses, hides, &amp;c., and supplies large quantities of cotton goods, indigo, silk, and (when the local crop fails) rice. Indian trade has suffered very much from bad packing and thefts, and from damage in transit between India and Mesopotamia. A list of the chief exports from Mesopotamia will be found in Table III of the Appendix (p. 133). They consist very largely of agricultural or animal products. Other important exports are carpets, gall-nuts, gums, and liquorice. Of agricultural products the most im portant exports are dates, cereals, seeds, and opium. Dates. —For the period 1007-1913 the weight of the annual export of dates has been about 60,000 tons, averaging a value of over £450,000. The bulk of the export goes normally to the United Kingdom, other im portant markets being the United States, Russia, Egypt, Tunis, Oran, and Australia. Cereals. —Of these the barley trade is the most im portant, and has in recent years exceeded the combined trade in wheat, rice, paddy (unhusked rice), and seeds. Before the inauguration of the Hamburg-Amerika line at Basra the United Kingdom took almost the whole of the export of cereals, but in recent years a very large part has been diverted to Hamburg. Jeddah is also a considerable buyer of Mesopotamian cereals. The Consular Reports give the following figures for the export of grain for the years 1911-13:— (a) Exports 1911. 1912. 1913. To London . Hamburg Antwerp Jeddah Tons. Tons. Tons, 90,000 92,700 20,350 78.000 58,000 4,800 2,000 9,300 — 18,000 40,000 20,100 [285—66] I114 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 The trade in cereals has in the past suffered from transport difficulties, which caused great delays in get ting the crops to Basra, from the lack of proper granaries for the storage of corn pending shipment, which involved heavy losses owing to the deterioration of the grain, and from the dirty condition in which grain was shipped. [See pp. 79. 80.) Seeds. —There is a considerable export of many kinds of seeds, including coriander, cummin, fennel, hoort- man (a kind of oat), linseed, poppy, quince, mahleb, and alfalfa. The statistics of exports of seeds fToin Basra represent an average annual value of £119,000 for the period 1906-1912, but the figure includes maize and millet, and the latter no doubt forms a large pro portion of the total. Opium. —The export of opium is important, and averaged £117,000 annually for the ten years ending in 1913. The opium is almost entirely in transit from Persia, and is shipped to Hong-Kong. Practically the whole trade is in British hands. The chief animal products are live stock, ghee, hides and skins, wool, and mohair. Horses are all exported to India. The trade has fluctuated in the past, owing to various restrictions placed upon it from time to time, but has been steadier in recent years. The horses exported are almost entirely Arab, though there are also a few Persian and Kurdish ponies. The average of the trade is about 1,750 animals of an annual value of £50,000. Other animals are exported rid Syria or Erzerum, and db not appear in the Basra returns; no recent figures for this trade are available. Ghee, a kind of clarified butter, is exported via Basra to Bombay, the Red Sea, and the Levant. It has practically no sale amongst Europeans. The trade is on the increase. There is also a considerable overland trade with Syria, of which no particulars are avail able. Hides and Skins. —This is an important branch of trade, and the returns of exports rid Basra do not in-Mesopotamia] EXPORTS 115 elude the whole of the trade, a good deal of which goe^. overland to Constantinople and Russia, bheep and lamb, goat, fox, and stone-marten skins, and ox and cow hides, are the articles of this class most commonly dealt with at Basra. The trade in untanned skins has decreased in recent years. The skins are exported to England, France, Germany, Austria, the United States, and the Levant ports, as well as to Russia and other parts of Turkey. Wool. —The average annual export of wool trom Basra amounted for the period 1904-13 to £238,000. The wool is of three kinds. The Arab wool, clipped from the Arab sheep reared in the plains, has a crinkly staple of fine fibre and a bright appearance. Karadi wool, clipped from the Kurdish hill sheep, has a long, coarse, and hairy staple, and is chiefly used for carpets and other heavy goods, Awassi wool, clipped ii'om sheep which are a cross between the Arab and Kurdish sheep, possesses some of the characteristics of both. Mohair is clipped from the Angora goat. The value of the export from Basra has decreased in recent years, and averaged only £11,400 in value for the period 1909-13 as against £28,000 for the previous five years. The export mostly goes to Great Britain, Germany, and France, and to other parts of Turkey. Among miscellaneous exports are carpets, gall-nuts, gum tragacanth, and liquorice. Carpets—This branch of trade represents a value of about £52,000 annually. The import of Persian carpets from Kermanshah fell off very much between 1910-14, and the trade is now mostly in carpets manufactured in Mesopotamia. The chief buyers are the United States, Great Britain, Egypt, France, Ger many, and India. . i i Gall-nuts are produced by the eggs deposited by the gall-fly on the oak-trees growing in the hills of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, and are used in tanning. They are collected by the tribes, and are sold to dealers in Mosul and other towns in the vicinity of the hills. Their commercial value depends upon their [285—66] 1 2116 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No 9 2 colour; blue galls are most valued for tanning and farm the bulk of the export; greens are less valued, but are exported to a small extent; whites were not exported at all until Germany took to buying them. The value of the trade is increasing, and in 1912 reached a total of £150,000, as compared with an average of £44,000 for the previous five years. Germany is the largest buyer. Gum tragacanth is obtained from the Astragalus, a bush which grows in northern Persia, Kurdistan, and northern Mesopotamia. The better-class gums come from the Persian frontier and Persia, the gums ob tained in northern Mesopotamia being of low quality. The collection is in the hands of the nomad or semi- nomad tribes, and the incision of the bark necessary to obtain the gum is not done scientifically, with the result that full quantity is never obtained. The export from Basra has averaged £21,000 in recent years. The bulk goes to London and Marseilles, but recently Russia has become a buyer of importance. Liquorice. —The liquorice plant grows wild in patches all along the banks of the Euphrates, from Meskene to Diwania, and along the Tigris, from Mosul to Kut el-Amara. It is also found on the Khabur and Diala Rivers, and on the Shatt el-Hai. The root is dug by Arabs, and is brought to receiving stations, where it is weighed and then cured. Later it is shipped down to Basra, where it is pressed into bales for export. About 85 per cent, of the export goes to the United States. The trade, which annually amounts to about £55,000. is almost entirely in the hands of Messrs. Mac Andrews &amp; Forbes, of Baghdad and Basra. (b) Imports A list of the chief imports will be found in Table IV of the Appendix (p. 134). Cotton. —The import consists chiefly of cotton piece- goods. The statistics seem to indicate that this branch of imports doubled between 1904 and 1913, but the impression given is not accurate, because in 1908 theMesopotamia] IMPORTS 117 basis of valuation of cotton imports for the purpose of statistics was changed, and an addition of 30 per cent, was made to the import price. Until Germany appeared in the Gulf trade, the import of cotton goods was entirely in the hands of Great Britain and India, and even immediately before the war Manchester w T as still providing more than ten times the amount sup plied by any other country except India. Austria comes third, but usually considerably below India. Sugar — to 1905 nearly all the sugar imported came from France and Great Britain in British bot toms. After 1906 the Hamburg-Amerika line began to push Belgian sugar, which was imported from Ant werp at a freight of 20.s\, as against 355. per ton charged for French brands shipped at Marseilles, and by this means, in the space of a few years, practicalh captured the whole of the trade. Austrian and Bel gian sugars were popular mainly because the\ weio cheaper, but also because they were harder and less liable to iniury by rough transport. The total import of sugar increased from a value of £121,000 m 1904 to £721.000 in 1913. i . I von and Steel. — 1 his branch ot trade is still com parativelv unimportant, averaging in normal years only about £21,000. By 1914 the trade was almost entirely in Belgian, German, and Swedish goods, and British goods had been ousted. A large portion ot the trade was in iron girders, which are largely supplanting wooden beams for building purposes in Baghdad and elsewhere; the demand for these was almost entirely supplied bv Belgium. . . Machinery.— This branch of trade is mostly m the hands of Great Britain, though Belgium. Germany, India, France, Austria-Hungary, and the United States also contribute. In recent years the trade has included a large number of oil engines and centnuiga pumps for irrigation. In 1911 £25,000 worth o machinery came from Europe for the Government m 1 ' 1 tarv factory at Baghdad. At Baghdad, m 1912, theu were 5 ice-machines, 24 flour-mills, and 6 rice-mi s,118 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS No. 92 working with British machinery. A British firm had set up an engineering workshop, and had also started motor-cars and 'buses daily between Baghdad and Bakuba (31 miles). German success in sewing- machines has been considerable. The great increase in 1913 in imports of iron and steel was mainly for use on the Baghdad Kailway. Both Germany and France had, in 1914, sent representatives to study the market. There will no doubt be a large opening for trade in machinery in the near future, particularly in motor ploughs, threshing-machines, and otjher agricultural machinery. Wood. —The chief import under this heading is date- boxes. At one time these came almost entirely from the Bukovina, and were shipped at Fiume, but recently Sweden and Norway have begun to compete. The wood is imported in cut lengths ready to be nailed together in Basra. The transport of date-boxes was before the war falling more and more into German hands, as many as 173,000 being carried by them in 1912. A trial shipment from Mysore (State Forest Depart ment) proved unsuccessful, as the boxes were too heavy, the workmanship was inadequate, and the Department could neither turn out sufficiently large quantities nor compete with German freights. For boat-building Malabar wood is chiefly used, and is imported roughly sawn into the shapes required, as sawing is very costly in Mesopotamia. Planks for other purposes came largely from Russia (Odessa wood) and India. In 1913 Russia supplied nearly all, owing to an increase in the price of Indian teak. There has been a large increase in the import of planks, dtie to building activity in Baghdad and elsewhere. Poles and rafters were originally brought from Kurdistan, but the Kurd hillsides being now nearly stripped of timber, cheap Russian wood was being imported in its place. India should be able to export her wood advantageously to Mesopotamia in the native sailing-vessels which go to fetch dates. Woollen Goods—In 1906 a considerable impetus wasMesopotamia] IMPORTS 119 . pi ven to the import of these goods owing to ^ troduetion into Persia by the Persian pilgrims. h use became increasingly popular in the succeeding jeais. and the trade was recognised as capable ot S 1 ' development. The chief sources of ™ el ® 111 United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Austna -llun- gary, the three latter sending cheaiier qualities at prices with which the British manufacturer could not compete. German half-mixed woollen cloth was espe- ciallv popular with the poorer classes. In 1913 Italy supplanted the United Kingdom as the greatest supplier of woollen goods. nackae es Yarn and Twist. —Normally about ^000 pat Rages are imported, of the value of about £70,000, the sup pliers being the United Kingdom, Germany, India, ^^unmes, made of jute, and used tor the packing of goods for mule and camel transport, are imported ho India The amount imported varies with the expoit of grain. The average value of the import is about £75 000. In 1911 it rose to £111,000. Petroleum was formerly imported ^ ^ ^ from Russia, but a shortage in the supply 0 ^ uss ^ oil in 1906 gave American and Austrian low-grade oils a chance to get a footing; more than hall Hie pases imported at Basra in that year were American. In 1907 American and Austro- Hungarian oils were rapidly advancing in favour at the expense ni Russia, In 1909 there was still sharp com n ^ lt T 3S ^ ^ American, Austrian, and Rui «ian mis ; Kussia sen 45 000 cases, America 35,000, and Austria 22.000. In 1910 there was a decline in the import of Austrian oil which in the following year ceased altogether. In 1J1I two oil steamers brought over American petroleum. The increasing use of oil engines and e . U mn lamps were the chief factors in the increased eonsu ^ - tion. In 1913 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company reached the producing stage, with Ae /esnilt that the American imports dropped from ovei 150, , in 1912 to 66,000 in 1914, in which year the Angl120 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS I ersian C ompany provided more than 50 per cent, of the country's requirements. Coal. —The coal imported is chiefly Welsh, but a little comes sometimes from India. The burning of bricks for the Hindie barrage led to a largely increased consumption in 1910 and 1911, and the increase of river launches and establishment of arsenal stores also led to an increased demand. Rice is imported wholly from India. In 1909 the Mesopotamian rice crop failed, and a much larger quantity \\as imported than in the preceding year. The quantity imported has remained high, in spite of a large increase of export in the succeeding years. In 1913 another and more complete failure of the rice crop led to an abnormally large import. The export of rice and paddy is usually largely in excess of the import. Cofjee. An average of 15,000 bags is annually im ported, at an average cost of £53,000. The price has risen considerably of late years. A good deal is now exported to Persia, but Persian and Kurdish troubles checked this in 1913. Indian coffee has been com pletely driven out of the market by the cheaper Brazilian brand, which was imported in great quan tities, largely through Great Britain. A little coffee was also obtained From Germany and Arabia, and Germany also supplied some Brazilian brands. Coffee is slowly being supplanted in favour of tea. Indigo. —The value of the average annual import for the last eight years was £20,000, but the trade has steadily decreased, that for 1906 amounting in value to £24,000. and that for 1913 to £15,000. All is imported from India, chiefly for Baghdad. The natives are beginning to prefer printed European goods to the cloths dyed at Baghdad, and synthetic dyes im ported from Germany proved to be cheaper than indigo. Aniline dyes were also imported directly and in directly from Germany, and had entirely supplanted madder, which was formerly imported from Persia.Mesopotamia! IMPORTS 121 Matches. —Before the war Swedish matches almost had a monopoly of the market, Belgium, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Japan furnishing only small quantities. I he trade was originally done through Germany, but was latterly done directly with Sweden. Persia was a considerable importer. Japan is now supplying the country with large quantities ol a cheap but unsatisfactory match. Coyper was imported from the United Kingdom, India, Belgium, and France to the extent of about 8,200 bundles, value £45,000 annually. Most of it went to Baghdad to make cooking utensils. A good deal is now being imported from Japan. Leather and Leather Goods. —The import fluctuates a good deal. France has long been established as the chief supplier of lea ther at Mosul. I he I nited States, very successful at Beirut, was gradually extending her leather supplies over the north. Cheap leather for common shoes came mainly from India. ( hina and Singapore sometimes supply buffalo hides for shoes. The United Kingdom, Belgium, and India did all the leather trade through Basra in 1009, but since that date Great Britain has rapidly lost ground. In 1913 leather supplies came from France, Belgium, the United Kingdom. Austria-Hungary, India, Ger many, and the United States. Provisions (tinned meats, &amp;c.) were obtained irom India, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The aver age annual value for the six years from 1906 to 1912 was about £75,000; but the general scarcity in 191o led to an increased import of provisions, viz., £100.000 worth. Spices are imported wholly from India. The annual value of the import for some 11 years past has been about £27.000: there was a fall in 1913 on account of general trade depression. Stationery. —The import of stationery, after remain ing at a uniform level for four vears, rose in 1907 from £20,000 to £50,000, a figure which it has not attained since, having kept an average of a little under £40,000.m ECONOMIC CONDITIONS inc. 92 , ✓ It was supplied by Germany and Austria-Hungary, with a little from the United Kingdom, and German imports were increasing steadily up to 1914. Tea. —The value of the tea import steadily rose from 1904 to 1908, since which date it has remained almost stationary. India has always been the principal sup plier; Russia formerly sent some, but has ceased to do so; China has recently done a considerable trade. In 1913 India sent 82| per cent., China 17 per cent., and the remaining J per cent, came from Japan. The total value in 1913 was £48,986. Consumption has been steadily increasing of late years among the Arabs. Tobacco is nearly all imported from Persia, though a very little comes from Constantinople. In 1907 the import showed a notable increase, which was not main tained in the three following years. The value of the tobacco imported in 1912 was £27,600, but in 1913 this fell to £8,970, probably on account of the insecurity of traffic and the general trade depression. (D) FINANCE (1) Public Finance This subject is discussed in Handbook No. 89, A natolia. (2) Currency Turkish currency is discussed in detail in No. 46, Turkey in Europe, but the subject requires some notice here owing to the complication which, under the Turkish regime, was caused by the large use of Persian and, to a less extent, of Indian coinage at Basra and even at Baghdad. Before the war the coinage both at Baghdad and Basra was based upon the Turkish lira : one Turkish lira=100 gold piastres = 4,000 paras. The medjidieh (the 20-piastre piece) was reckoned officially as worth 19 gold piastres, and was chiefly used in payment of customs duties and other taxes. The par exchange toMesopotamiaJ CURRENCY 123 sterling was 110 lurkish lira=£100 steiling. Banking accounts were kept in liras (100 piastres = 1 lira), but for business transactions the number ot piastres m tiie lira varied, 1031 being usually reckoned m wholesale transactions and 108 in retail. Small coins were very scarce, and were practically confined to revenue purposes, so that it was absolutely necessary to employ the silver and copper coinage ot other countries in giving change m bazaar purchaset,, although such coins were nominally prohibited. re foreign coins chiefly used were the 1 ersian kran, Indian rupee, and the sovereign, the rates ol which were fixed weekly according to supply and demand. \t Basra the Persian coinage was even more in ube than at Baghdad, and Indian silver was also current, though occasionally impounded under the regulations. Certain fictitious coins were also used as units ot com putation in particular classes ol transactions, with a view to lessening the inconvenience caused by tluctua- tions in the value of actual coins. Since the British occupation Indian currency has been established in the country, the exchange o e lira being provisionally fixed at Rs. 13-8, the rurkiy 1 coinage being accepted in payment ol revenue. Hras received were kept in deposit, as there were o - vious objections to permitting Turkish coins to circu late; and at the present time the circulation ot Indian coins and notes is on much the same footing in the occu pied part of Mesopotamia as in India. Indian notes have been absorbed in large quantities the rate ot ex change is maintained at a regular level, and merchants are thereby enabled to work on a narrower margin ot profit. New notes are put into circulation as tre- quently as possible, and every effort is made to meet promptly a demand for notes or cash when it arises. Merchants are in the habit of sending their remittances by means of notes, and at one time notes were at 1 per cent, premium at Amara. Every effort is made o pro vide sufficient quantities of small change by issuing packets of mixed change as part ot rupee payments.124 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS [No. 92 J he wide use of the Persian kran, coupled with the wide fluctuations of its exchange value, have been a source of embarrassment to trade in the past, and it is important that means should be found of steadying the exchange, in view of the importance to Mesopo tamia of the Persian markets. It has been suggested 1 that if, as appears probable, the Indian rupee is to continue to be current in Meso potamia after the war, steps should be taken to give Mesopotamia a subsidiary coinage in the form of cents and her own note issue as paper currency, on the same lines as have been followed in Ceylon and British East Africa. (3) Banking Before the outbreak of war, the only banks of im portance established in Mesopotamia were the Imperial Ottoman Bank, with branches at Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra, and the Eastern Bank, which had recently opened a branch at Baghdad. Banks were indeed scarcely used for the purpose of trade, and their place was partially filled by saraps. These, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, were mere money-changers, but they acted as private bankers, taking charge of cash or securities, against which the customer could draw- by chit. Trade credit was carried on also by means of commission houses, which collected orders from all quarters, taking payment from the traders by means of a deposit with the order and by a Kompiala bond tor the balance, the bonds being redeemed by instal ments. The Kompiala bond, which is a promissory note payable at date, could be discounted at rates of from 6 to 12 per cent., and was a good security in cer tain hands. The Imperial Ottoman Bank, for example, could put in motion the legal machinery to protest and recover; in some other hands the bond might be a source of expense. At the present time there are three large banks re- 1 Report to the ludiau Government on the prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia, hy R. E. Holland and J. H.

The development of Mesopotamia after the war should create opportunities for a wide employment 01 capital in banking business of the trading kind. Agriculture in particular is in especial need of financial support. It has hitherto been an established practice for the cu tivator to borrow money on the security of his crop be fore it has matured, giving a Kompiala, bearing a high rate of interest, as security. There is probably a good opening for the introduction of some system ot agricul tural banks on recognised lines, and this question should engage the early attention ot those concernec with the government of the country. (E) GENERAL REMARKS The future economic possibilities of Mesopotamia have formed the subject of the following reports made to the Governments of either Great Britain or India in recent years:— (a) Report upon the Conditions and Prospects ot British Trade in Mesopotamia, by Sir George Lloyd, published in 1908. (h) Report on the Development of Mesopotamia with special reference to the Regeneration o the River Systems, by Sir George^ Buchanan, K.C.I.E., M.I.C.E., published in 1917. (r) The Prospects of British Trade in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf, by R. E. Holland and J. H. Wilson, published in 1917. (rf) Report on the Future Development ot the 1 ort of Basra and its communications by Land and Water, by Sir George Buchanan, K.O.L.E., M.I.C.E., published in 1917. These reports have dealt at considerable length with various aspects of the problems involved, and sum-ECONOMIC ( ONDITIONS rNo- 92 maries of some of the conclusions arrived at have already been given. The future of Mesopotamia depends upon four con ditions : — (1) Security of administration, and a sympathetic attitude on the part of the Government to the economic needs of the country. (2) The increase of the cultivable area by the crea tion of a system of irrigation capable of expan sion as the needs of the population require. (3) The capacity of the inhabitants to undertake the heavy work which the proper development of the country will involve. (4) The improvement of means of communication. Of these conditions the first may be assumed, and the question of the improvement of means of communica tions has been dealt with under the headings of naviga tion and railways. The economic capacity of the in habitants is at present an unknown factor, but the con clusions arrived at by competent observers (see pp. 42, 71) are supported by the following extracts from a report on the prosperity of the Euphrates w T hich appeared in the Times of May 1. 1918 :— During the summer we have been at work on the irrigation scheme connected with the Hindieh barrage. The barrage, which was designed by Sir William Willcocks and constructed by Sir John Jackson's firm, was finished before the war, hut the Turk neglected to profit by it. The canalisation work con nected with it was left incomplete, and the area to be cultivated was never brought under irrigation. This year nearly a hundred canals on the Hilleh branch, which had fallen into disuse, have been dug out, 300,(XX) acres have been brought under cultivation, and there is promise of the greatest harvest in the memory of man, possibly the greatest since the days of Nebuchadnezzar. But the Shatt el-Hilleh developments are only part of the scheme. For several years the land on both banks of the Hindieh branch below the barrage down to Kifil has been out of cultivation, as the canals provided in the Willcocks scheme to irrigate that area were neglected. We were not long in getting to work at them. In May, as soon as the Tigris opera tions were completed, we began to open posts on theMesopotamia! GENERAL REMARKS 127 F.nohrates The work on the canals was started early in June; they were finished by the end o! October, and the ground thev irrigate is now under cultivation. Needless to say. the Arab cultivators welcome the neu regime. Their property, which has lain fallow for years, ^ill become rich and profitable. AH the summer and autumn they were busy getting their water channels clear Below the barrage some 14,000 Arabs were engaged in making the neu canals and clearing the old ones. Nearly every able-bodied man in the district is working for us. Turks The Arabs are an eminently sensible people. ihe iui *, when they evacuated the district, were for ^stroymg the Hindieh barrage, but the tribesmen preserved it. The Aral) knew the Turk would do nothing for him, and he would not pa&gt; him revenue if he could help it; but the collection of revenue on the Euphrates no longer calls for an armed force. aj ^ taxes has become an investment. For there is no cultivator m the world who will not lend a hand at getting water into his own fields. The Arabs appreciate the art of img^ion thoug i they do not excel in it; and we have come to them on the Euphrates as fertilisers of the soil. The cardinal question in relation to the future of Mesopotamia is the development of irrigation. At the time Sir William Willcoeks was m Mesopotamia the onlv evidence of the prosperity which in ancient times made the country famous were the traces of the gieat cities which in the time of Herodotus studded the country, and the silt banks of countless canals, which had been used in the past to make the country front Beled to the Persian Gulf one continuous forest o. verdure. From that point down-stream the greater part of the country consisted at first of nothing but bare plains of clay, ridged and furrowed with the n- mains of ancient irrigation channels, and destitute i all vegetation except leguminous thorn-bushes or jungles of liquorice near the rivers, with 'rcasioiia belts of poplar or willow. Further south salt lands ai &lt; marshes increased, but of cultivation or date palms there was hardly.a vestige, except here and there )\ rivers or canals.'

What will be probably more difficult will be the har- momsation of the costs of irrigation and the revenue from cultivation. Upon this point the views of Rohr- baoh. set out m Die Bagdadhnhn, are of interest Assuming that the irrigation and economic develop ment of M^opotamia would fall to Germany, he sue- gested the formation of a German canal and corn- exporting company, which would undertake the irriga tion of the country, charging for the water supply 10 per cent, of the value of each harvest. Tn order to avoid dispute with the Government, the company would arrange to substitute a fixed annual payment for the State taxes making itself, instead of the landowners, responsible for these to the Government. Tt would th'ii claim from the small owners one-fifth or one-quarter of the harvest. Plenty of tenants would in all proba bility be forthcoming, for corn cultivation and specula tion are not new to the richer Arabs.

Roh bach calculated that 300,000 to 400,000 tons of corn could be raised, which would be worth from 15 to 20 millions of marks on the spot, and three times that amount in the European markets He esumated that the company would require a capital of about 30 m 1- lion marks? and that the cost of irrigation would be ^s regards ^ps.tXnld be easy to extend the cut tivation of those already grown. But it is chjefiy-und the possibilities of Mesopotamia as a ^ton-growing country that hopes liave been centred. It was upo this tliat Germany was counting, bhe wished, it had been said, to make herself independent of other snppl.es bv turning Mesopotamia into one huge cotton-field. Uohrbach quoted the case of Turkestan, whence Russia recently imported 600,000 to 700,000 bales of cotton annually. He suggested that G~ ^'les should obtain large concessions, which they could let out in small parcels to natives. Germany, it was thought, should look to Mesopotamia for cotton il her own colonies failed her, and the Baghdad Railway Company was reported to he already encouraging cotton-growing in the north in ' 2. • u „i Mr S P Foaden, late of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, gives the following as the climatic advantages which Mesopotamia possesses for cotton growing. (1) The length of the growing season—six or seven months of high and rising temperature. Both Egyptian and American cotton sufter trom .m excess of cold during the |&gt;eriod, (2) No sudden fall of temperature during the period. (3) A fall of temperature after growth is completea. which helps to ripen the fruit. (4) The absence of summer rain. (5) Mesopotamian cotton would receive the greatest moisture at the time when moisture is most needed, viz., from March to June. [285—66] K130 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (No. 92 Mesopotamia is, it is true, hotter and drier than most cotton-producing countries, but not more so than Upper Egypt, where cotton is now successfully grown. The soil of Mesopotamia contains a good propor tion of phosphorus, potash, and nitrogen, but a very large percentage of lime (12 to 14 03 per cent.) the effect of which on cotton-growing cknnot be satisfac torily foretold, although cotton is cultivated in some parts of America where the percentage is higher. The soil, a deep loam of a light nature, not retentive of water, but needing a plentiful supply, is precisely the kind most suitable for cotton. Cotton-growing in Egypt brings in 7 to 8 per cent., but in Egypt there is good communication and a teem ing population. Returns in Mesopotamia would be slower, and the labour supply is much more limited. It is also considerably cheaper, but the natives would expect to receive a proportion of the crop. Other directions in which expansion has been sug gested are— (1) In the natural products of the country, i.e., gall- nuts, liquorice, and gum tragacanth. (2) In the export of dried fruits. (3) In the trade in wool. It must be remembered that sheep-farming is the natural occupation of the Arabs, and is to-day the principal source of livelihood of the nomad and semi-nomad tribes, and irrigation schemes must be conceived so as to conserve for afforestation and pasturage large areas in addition to those under cultivation. The possibilities of sheep-farming in Mesopo tamia are prodigious, since not only the wool but also the skins are known and approved in European markets, and the quality could doubt less be improved considerably if expert know ledge were available. Under the head of industries small development is to be looked for until much more is known about the mineral resources of Mesopotamia than is known to day, and the country will remain for a long time essen tially agricultural.Mesopotamia] AUTTIORTTTES 137 Handbook of Mesopotamia, 4 vols.
