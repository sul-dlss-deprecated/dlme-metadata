The Director of Military Operations presents his compliments to the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and hegs to forward a copy of a telegram (No.5870 dated 13th April) from the General Officer Conmanding, Mesopotamia, relative the formation of a small body of Indian police for duty at the Ang].o Persian oilfields. With reference to Foreign Office letter No. 24282/W/34 dated 20th February the General Officer Coirmanding, Mesopotamia, was instructed to withdraw the troops in the vicinity of the oilfields as soon as certain improvements to communications were completed, hut to retain sufficient troops in the Karun valley to give effect to the policy outlined in telegram No. 537 dated 15th January 1919 from the Civil Conmissioner, Mesopotamia. A regiment of Indian Cavalry has been detailed accordingly for the latter duty. Major-General Radcliffe proposes to approve of the establishment of a small body of police at the oilfields as suggested and would be glad to hear if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurs in a reply in this sense being sent to the G.O.C.

Acting on sanction accorded in W.0.75596 D.M.O. February 25th during May I am withdrawing troops from the Oil Fields. After a personal visit to the Oilfields I consider that in order to maintain order among the Indian and Chinese labourers, who have occasional internal disturb ances among themselves, a anall party of Indian Police is necessary. Though Bakhtiaris maintain order among the local labour it is contrary to policy to call upon Bakhtiari Sowars to quell these. During the past three years the presence of troops has obviated the necessity for police. I propose for the ensuing year to loan a volunteer party of one British N.C.O. and 30 Indians to tha A.P.O.C. who will arrange a permanent police for the future. No political questions with the local khans would be involved. The cost will be charged against the A.P.O.C. and replacements from India will be required in Units from which volunteers are taken. This proposal is strongly endorsed by the local management of the A.P.O.C. and 1 request an early confirms- tion.COPY TO to. SECRET. ' POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. P. Date. j Initials.

A wire from Foreign Office dated October 5th giving reasons why personnel of A.P.O.C. should not be formed into a military unit, has been forwarded to me by the Naval Commander-in- Chlef. But Foreign Office apparently does not object so long as force is purely a volunteer unit. Naval Commander-in- Chief stated that Admiralty is strongly opposed to any enrolment of A.P.O.C. personnel. Under the circumstances I should like to know whether scheme should be proceeded with.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company employed total of 87 Europeans and Canadians of whom 42 are located at Karun Front including only 26 actually at oil fields The Military value of forming this small number into a unit would be insignificant, but I think that these men should be capable of using fire arms for self defence. 2. Civil Commissioner informs me that from report of his political officer at Ahwaz, the employees at the oil fields are considerably below establishment; they are worked to their utmost capacity and have no time or energy to spare for military training. The manager at Muhammareh, presumably under instructions from Home, is in favour of compulsory service and the formation of a defene unit provided the status and direction of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are in no way interfered with. Among the employees however there seems to be no general desire for such an arrangement*. 3. In the circumstances I recommend the formation of an A.P.O.C. volunteer unit, the encouraging of all employees to join it and the limiting of their training to the use of the rifle and machine gun.

Tne proposal that they should form part of any organised defence force had never entered their mind. ihe new road building operations raised suspicions with regard to safety of oil fields (4 corrupt groups) they might be armed and be given a chance of doing their snare in case of trouble. There are from time to time indications of a feeling that some outward form of recognition to show that they are engaged in war work might be extended to them but I do not think putting them into uniform would meet the case since they realise that they J^ave no time for training wo^k as they are at highest possible pressure.

It is within my personal knowledge that the Company is greatly understaffed, and it is my deliberate opinion that the Europeans have under present conditions no time to spare from their heavy and often exhausting work often performed under very trying circumstances.

Secretary of State's telegram, June 26th. Defence of oil-fields. Prom current correspondence je'jween War Oft ice and General, Bagdad, it appears * despatch of troops to oilfields is contemplated on the recommendation of Brigadier-General Younghusband whilst on leave. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, who lias corns to Bagdad at my request is emphatically of opinion their despatch would have an adverse political effect. He considers step would increase distrust of our intentions felt by many Persians including some of the junior Khans and that if troops are once sent they cannot withdraw without risk of misconception and even of disturbance. He points out situation is now more satisfactory than at any time since the outbreak of war whilst we have the additional advantage of greatly improved communications. I entirely concur with his opiiions and trust they will receive due consideration. The measures advocated in my telegram 6193 dated July 27th if sanctioned will render position of oilfields even more secure than at present, but views espressed above do not depend on their adoption. I do not know how question arose at home but my impression is that in these matters Directors are acting on their own initiative and not on the advice of their * local representatives nor in consequence of information received from latter.

Whitehall, S../.1- 30th July 1918. „^ T |4' V Dear Mr. Greenway, Thank you very much for your letter of the 19th instant with its interesting enclosure. The Ilkhani and Ilbegi are on their best behaviour mw, and have just inflicted a defeat on the Kuhgel*** which we are told will secure the Lynch road for 2 years’. At the sane time we have heard from 0.0.C., Mesopotamia that orders have been issued for the construction of wire fences and electric li^t installation round the more important wells; that the bridge at Darren Khazmeh is being strengthened; and that a new road from tnere to the oil-fields is being put in hand. t v&gt;nnp will relieve immediate These measures I hope win i tu anxiety.

Jl« 4 Pi. h ■ Jtinted. Lt}. ?■^&gt; &amp;&gt;/e K ~ a 19th July,1918 Ji'. C. £. ^ \ Dear Sir Arthur &gt; Many thanks for your letter of the 16th instant, and for the explanations you give about the arrangements for the volunteer force. I have altered my telegram to Persia accordingly. I note that the Military and Political Authorities still think that it is undesirable, for the same reasons as before, to place a guard on the Oil fields, which means I suppose that the proposal to surround the field with a barbed wire fence ii also abandoned. This is a pity. The situation has quite changed (owing to the known German designs on the Persian Oilfidds) since the question^was previously considered, and I cannot help thinking that if the additional reasons which now exist for strengthening the defences on the field were fully explained t&gt;o the Bakhtiari Khans, and at the same time it was made clear to them that their Guards would still be retained and I the British guard only be sent as an additional defence, they could be induced to see that the proposal is as much in their interests as our own. No question of- 2 - 'amour propre' is involved inasmuch as they have already got British troops (those at Tembi) in the Bakhtiari Territory. Moreover, the principle which led to the previous decision is now being disregarded in Northern Persia, and the II Khani of the Bakhtiaris (Samsam-es-Sultanah) is himself Premier! However, the enclosed interesting letter from Dr. Young is somewhat reassuring, although I doubt whether he is fully 'au courant' with the dangers of the situation from the point of view of possible German action. Yours sincerely, Sir Arthur Hirtzel, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.MOIfc The General Manager, Messrs. Strlck, Scott &amp; Co., MOHAMMER AH. Dear Sir, D/0, POLITICAL . In my letter of the 25th March, I gave you a brief account of the general situation as it stood about a month ago. I do not think that much has transpired in the north to produce any decisive change, but the fact that the Cabinet in Teheran has resigned last r?eek may have some effect on the position before long. There appears to be every indication that Samsam-e- Sultaneh will be called upon to form a Ministry. Thus, history repeats itself, and it may not be long ere Isfahan and other towns in the North are in Bakhtiari hands again. This may be undesirable from many points of view, but it is admittedly an unavoidable course in th* present state of Persian politics. With our troops in Hanadan and other centres, however, the like lihood is that they will lean on our* side, and in these circum stances we shall he in a far more favourable position than we were in 1915. I understand that there is a fair understanding between Samsam and ourselves at present, but personally I do not believe that nis Ministry will last any time as I nave always held theview that the Bakhtlarls were unfit to deal with the governments of towns or provinces, and, still less with the Central Government. In tribal matters they are in their element and it is all that they are good for. In any higher position, a Bakhtlari Khan is like a fish out of the water. ( LIKhAI. ZAFFAR . with regard to the position of the Illkhani, I have been asked for an expression of opinion, and I have made certain recommendations to H.M. ! s Vice Consul, which H.v. ’s Minister in Teheran has accepted both in principle and in detail. It was agreed that any proposals for maintaining the power of the present Uikhani and Illbegi, should have for their object the formation of strong personal ties between H.M. f s Government and S. Zaffar. In preference to paying out large sums ol money from time to time, which appeared to have no finality, I suggested the payment of a personal subsidy to Zaffar, for the duration of the war, provided he remained Illkhani and confirmed to our wishes in every way. The matter should be kept secret, at any rate as regards the actual amount paid to him. The illbegi, whose position was uncertain, must be treated on a different footing. a lump sum paid annually to Illkhani and Illbegi, which is to be distinct from our monthly subsidy to 5. Zaffar, would dispose of any claim on us by the Illbegi. The advantages of the arrangement are obvious: Zaffar, who is very pressed lor money, would know definitely what he would lose if hedid not act up to his obligations; it would enable us to put a stop to the perpetual cry for financial help, because he would have his subsidy paid regularly every month; it would render him more subservient to our wishes, and in the lonp run it would be cheaper for us. His allowance could be stopped at any time, and on the first sign of his running counter to us. At the Vice Consul’s request, I met the Khans with him in Ahwaz last wee!• The negotiations were successfully con cluded, and the above arrangement, of which the Minister approved, is now in force. Zaffar appeared to attach the greatest importance to the moral effect of 2 mountain guns, and in my opinion he was right. I realize perfectly well all the reasons that may be put forward against the issue of these arms, but it is useless entering into compacts with Chiefs to take up arms on your behalf when they have no arms to take up. After all, we have had to do it with the Arabs, not in this country but elsewhere in the East, and in a limited decree, under careful supervision, it could be done here. The fact that in the absence of ammunition they could not attack us is undoubtedly a point in our favour, but in this war we must remember that the Germans would soon arm them if attacks were contemplated, as indeed they have done in other parts of Persia 3 years ago. I never believed, and do net believe now, that of their own accord the Khans would fight against us if they could notfight for us, whatever their political intrigues may be. Opposed, therefore, as I should be, to the indiscriminate ssue of arms, I cannot help regarding the matter as deserving o- v ^ of careful consideration within given limits, in the same manner as we consider the financial aspect of our support. I recommend^that the 2 mountain guns should be granted for the Kuhgilu expedition only , on condition that they should be returned in a few months. This has now been granted by Teheran and Baghdad, and the Military authorities have decided to send a complete mountain battery, in charge of a British Officer, to accompany the Khans on their march against the Kuhgilus. Our men and guns will return on completion of the expedition, and this is really the most satisfactory arrangement for all concerned For the return of the guns, the Khans have pledged all their properties in Arabistan to be forfeited to His Majesty T s Govern ment. The last item in our programme was the necessary ex penditure for the expedition. I should mention that we were particularly keen to keep the Khans busy in the South during the next month or two. We do not want them in the neighbourhood of Isfahan, or anywhere nearer their brothers in Teheran, until the situation has cleared up there, and until our posts have been properly established at Hamadan and other fixed points. The Khans have been advanced Ts.10,000 by Government to be returned within 6 months. I have agreed to this loan berg guaranteed by the Company f s subsidy for guarding, but they should be ableto repay it out of the Kuhgilu revenue which has not been ssiiBii collected for several years. Instead of being paid to the ilhans, the next Eakhtiari Quarterly Instalment will be paid by us, on the Khans 1 behalf, to H.M f s Vice Consul, Ahwaz. As in 1915, the Khans have given us a written undertaking to allow no enemy agents into Bakhtiari country. The arrangements made were in every way satisfactory to the Khans, and they appeared to appreciate it. They were convinced in a practical manner that our support had not been instigated by any ulterior motives, and both Zaffar and Ashja knew too well that it was not the German method. All £e desired was that they should maintain order in their country, expel enemy agents, and, in the event of a struggle, that they should stand by us instead of by our enemies. I insisted on a Governor being appointed at kialamir in the summer, when Illkhani and Illbegi themselves are away in the North, and Zaffar has now put one of his sons there. Maiamir is only a couple of days’ journey from here, and it is the gateway to .the North. He will maintain order on the Bakhtiari Road, and visit the Fields and neighbourhood once a month. We shall thus have some one in the South to appeal to in the summer, which we have not had hitherto. I do not wish to over-estimate the importance of theabove settlement with the local Chiefs. Persian affairs are ** often governed by factors which are beyond our immediate control, P -and troubles must be met as they arise. With the disappearance of--P-ussia, it was inevitable that the situation woul'.; become acute again in Persia, and we must look ahead. In face of all the troubles that we went through, I think that we maintain- d our position very well in fiakhtiari country, and if experience is worth anything, I may say without hesitation^that k«r« struck the right key by generously supporting the Illkhaai j and Illbegi of the day. It has had a splendid effect in the country, and I am confident that we shall reap the benefit in time. Yours faithfully, (Sgd) M. Y. Young.&lt;v &gt;f k) SECRET. OPE R A T I 0 N !

The Military Authorities here tell me that General Marshall is not likely to do more than send a N.C.O. instructor (unless the total number of men is much more than 40, which I think is the figure you mentioned), and to allow an officer from the local staff to inspect occasionally. It may be possible to provide arms; but uniforms and equipment would, of course, have to be paid for by the Company. A rifle range would also be necessary, which would probably cost £200 or £300,and some encouragement in the fora of shooting prizes. authorities still think that to place a guard at the oil-fields, as proposed by General Youngjiusband, is undesirable, for the sane reason as before.

Addressed to Foreign repeated to 3;of S.MINUTE . The past history of the question of providing a guard for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s settlement at Maidan-i-Naphtun and their pumping station at Tembeh may be briefly recapitulated. As far back as December, 1915, the Company asked that M a force of 500 to 1000* men” might be sent to Mai dan for the protection of the settlement) but the military authorities in Mesopotamia did not see their way to comply with the request and the matter was dropped. On the 17th October, 1916, the Commander-in-Chief •in India, in a telegram to the V/ar Office, drew attention to the risk of damage being done to the pumping station, the custody of which had been entrusted to the Bakhtiaris, and suggested that 'the additional protection conferred 'by a regular guard” was desirable. The Government of India (telegram of 2nd November, 1916) agreed that the time U ^ had come ”to subordinate political considerations and to ”put protection of the oil-fields on a sound military ”footing H . The assent of the Persian Government was obtained (Sir C. Marling’s telegram No, 716, 18th November, 1916) and the proposal was duly approved. The detachment, was at first stationed at Maidan, but subsequently transferred to the pumping station at Tembeh. los location at the former place drew forth a protest from Lne local Bakhtiaris (though the Khans in Tehran had consented), and Sir P. Cox found it necessary (see his letter to the Bakhtiari Ilkhani, 27th January, 1917) to offer something in the nature of an apology for ever sending there, and to enlarge upon the need of ”exceptional precautions” in ”exceptional times”. It is not qu:. t,e clear why - as the correspondence ratherMinute Paper, Department. rather suggests - the preeence of British troops at, t'aidan should be regarded as more open' to objection on political grounds than their location a few miles off at Tembeh.

D’Arcv. which rims for (iO 3 ’ears from the -Mil May IdOl, and Irives the exclusive right to drill for, produce, pipe, and carry aw?.y on and petroleum ]) rod nets throughout the whole Persian Pmpire excluding the i\e Nonhorn provinces (Azerbaijan, Ohiian, Mazanderan Asterabad, and Khoi- assau). The onlv oil-fiehls at present being worked by the Compant undei this concession are situated in the neighbourhood ol .Maidan-i-Naphtun in the Baklniari country, whence the oil is conyejjedm a pipe-hne to &gt;e Company s relinerv on Abadan Island at the head ol the Persian &lt;uili. Altei leaung the Bakhtiari hills the pipe-line runs through a tribal area subject to the influence of the Sheikh of Mohainnierab. Under agreement tilth the Company the Bakhtiari Khans have undertaken to police and protect the held uoiks a t upper section of the-pipe line, while the Sheikh ol Mohamnierah is unuei a siniilar ohligation in regard to the refinery and the lower part ol the line. 1 he Bakhtiari Khans are entitled, by agreement, to 3 per cent, ol the shares u v v formed to work oil in Paklitian country, and thus haw a substantial interest in tlie success of the venture. In May Pd 14 an agreement was concluded between the Company and the Admiralty, by winch tbe lattei acquired a sufficient number of shares to give them a controlling nueiest tlie_Companj t j 1( , pipe-lino was never interfered with; but m i ^ o FpIwu-u-v of the present vear eonsiderable,damage \vas done by the ' ' against the Sheikh of Mohamnierah, to the ^ioii l^' l^^en die Bakhtiari border and Ahwaz.

Its area covers the whole Persian ^ Empire, exclusive of the five northern provinces, and therefore includes lUshw and other Persian islands in the Gulf. But the Admiralty are not satisfied with this; they want to make the company's rights•'i I/* rights s^cur#, and tlvr^fora propose that His Majesty's Government should lease the islands and so obtain undivided , control over them. At the end of paragraph 3 of their letter they seem to go even further, and use l^gu^e toat m^t almost be exclusive of the 5 Northern provinces! The proposal to lease or purchase the islands i 3 not a new one; it was discussed at considerable length in 1914 (sea especially minute on P. 2017, flogged on the file below), and was then supported mainly on strategical grounds, it being held:- (1) that the groups of islands, tak^n togetrier, are, politically and strategically, the key to the Persian Gulf; (2) that they command Bunder Abbas, which had been declared by His Majesty’s Government to be the point at which the Trans-Persian railway must touch the sea; and (3) that, between them they form the best, if not the only, anchorage for men-of-war at the mouth of th^ Gulf, Negotiations on the subject proceeded throughout 1914, but little progress was made towards coming to an agreement with the Persian Government. Eventually, in January 1915, it was decided to drop the subject for the time being and it had not since been revised. The Admiralty letter raises isiues of a very wide nature, and it will doubtless be thought desirable to consult the Government of India and Sir P. Cox (to whom copies of the papers were sent, by the mail of 6thDecember), before committing ourselves to a definite expression of opinion. whole i.e. KihkaikIfeU Hen jam, Larak, j Horraus, and Sheikh/Shuaib] In any lurther communica tion on this subject, please quote no.^ noLyi^p- *nd address— 3 7 fy\/ The Under-Secretary of State, - Foreign Office, London.

Mr. Greenway appears to be under a misapprehen sion as regards the Bakhtiari Sirdars. Major-General Sir G. Macdonogh understands that the Ilkhani Sirdar Zaffar and the Ilbegi Sirdar Ashja were recommended by Captain Noel for their present appointments, while Sirdars Jang and Bahadur as Governors of Sultanabad and Burujird respectively will be in positions to exercise but little influence on the Bakhtiari tribes. f r ar Office, Whitehall, S.W.

C. •July 26th, 1917. * v A t' j r-s Sir:- My Board regard with the very gravest concern, as affecting the safety of their properties, the changes in the Persian political situation which have recently been brought about by the revolution in Russia, and desire me to lay their views before you for the consideration of His Majesty's Government♦ According to the advices we have received the Russian troops now occupying Northern Persia are, as is the case on all the Russian fronts, quite uncontrolled and uncontrollable, and instead of defending Persia against the Turkish forces are gradually withdrawing and occupying themselves solely with the looting of Persian towns. That is, instead of carrying out their ostensible duty of protecting Persia, against the enemy forces they have themselves become the enemies of Persia, and are at the same time, by their non-resisting retirement from the Persian frontiers, opening the road for a Turco-German occupation of the Country which will, no doubt, be under taken* or attempted, by the Commander in Chief oi the Turkish forces operating in Asia Minor as soon as circumstances permit. If The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S. W. I.® I4&gt; If no steps are taken to prevent this my Board fear that before very long another, and much more serious, attempt mil be made to attack the Oilfields, as these have always been one of the chief German objectives in that sphere of the War* The Anglo-Persian Company is now supplying the Navy in the Mediterranean with Fuel oil at the rate of 550,000 tons per annum, and the Allies collectively with Petrol at the rate of 150,000 tons per annum, apart from a further 80,000 tons of Fuel Oil, Petrol and Kerosene which is being supplied by the Company to the Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia, It is needless to point out that the loss of this large supply of Oil at the present time would have very disastrous consequences in connection with the conduct of the War, and my Board therefore feel it incumbert upon them to point out to His Majesty’s Government the urgent necessity which exists for taking prompt and effective action to guard against any such attack. The roads which will presumably be open to an enemy advance on the Oilfields, apart from the one through the Sagwand country which was adopted by the Turks in 1915 and which presumably can be defended by the present Mesopotamian forces, are as follows (1) from Kasr~i~Shirin to Dizful and Shustar, via Mendeli and the Pushtyi-Kuh road - about 350 miles. (2) from Kermanshah to Dizful and Shustar, via Bamrun and Ramiaskian - about 250 miles. (3) from Kermanshah to Dizful and Shustar, via Chahar Da^lj Amla and the Pusht-i-Kuh road - about 320 miles. It scarcely lies within the province of my Board to suggest the steps that are necessary to guard against a Turco-German attack on the Oilfields but they venture to put forward the following suggestions for consideration. (D that a strong force of Indian troops be sent to PersiaPersia to join up with the force now under coinnand of General Sir Percy Sykes, with a view to under taking - either with or without the co-operation of one Russian forces - the defence of the Kerman- shahAhanikin road, whereby any advance of enemy forces by any one of the above three roads could be prevented - or (..) tnat a sufficient force of Indian troops be sent to Arabistan to prevent any attack on the Oilfields from the Dizful/Shustar or Bakhtiari roads. (*-) woulo. o; course be the simpler proposition but it would leave the rest of Persia, open to occupation by the Turco-German forces. As regards this suggestion my Board also desire to point out the increased dangers which arise from the ascendancy which has recently been acquired by the pro-German Bakhtiari chiefs, as instanced by the nomination of Sirdars oang ana Bahadur to the Governorship of the tribes, in place o the pro-British chiefs - Amir Jang and Sirdar Zaffar. inese appointments would, so far as can be judged, appear to be due to the influence of German agents and it is needless to say that the handing over of the control of the Bakhtiari country to two chiefs v/hose sympathies have so unmistakeably in uhe past oeen pro —German - and who, unless tne British force in the neighbourhood is sufficiently strong to prevent such action, could no doubt be easily induced by the Germans to endeavour, without any assistance from the Turkish troops, to dispossess us of the Oilfields and . to do damage which it would take years to repair, - gives ground for a considerable amount of uneasiness as to what may j happen in that region in the near future in view of the quite inadequate British force now stationed in Arabistan, I have, etc,, (Signed) C.

Sardar Muhtasham^ IDrhnnj , dated January 27th 1917. |1097 a/C i Your Excellency's letter of 10th Rabi I 4th Janua 1917 J _ reached me January in a fortunate hour, and I was very glad to learn of your welfare and thank you for your greetings. Your Excellency wrote to me regarding the despatch of a detachment of British troops to the Oil Springs and said that this action had astonished the 'Government of Persia and had distjruhed peoples* minds. I am sorry to hear this but I trust that the explanations which follow will completely set your mind at rest. Your Excellency must remember that a state of war exists among the powers and that the enemies of Great Britain and her allies have been able to invade and tfee use axa the soil of Persia for the pursuit of hostilities simply because the Government of Persia, both at iihwaz in 1915 and now in the neighbourhood of N. Luristan, has shown herself unable to maintain the inviolability of her frontiers or keep enemy expeditions out. We fully agree with your observations as to the entire absence of incidents and friction at Maidan Haptun in the past and as to the satisfactory behaviour of the Bakhtiari Guards and as a matter of fact the troops were only sent to Maidan quite temporarily, while suitable arrangements were being made for them at Tembeh, but as regards the location of the detachment at the latter place, where they now are, it is clear that in these exceptional times when enemy parties are roaming about in Persia, exceptional precautions are necessary and we feel sure that on reflection the Persian i . kj .• V. o Li iii &amp; x * * India foreign secret ary 5 3 Government Letter.

Tho reason is that with large profit Lynch road pays the Khans (bridge tolls alone run to 50,000 tomans a year). Khans must take Kuhgelu question by the horns. However they know from bitter experience a purely Bakhtiari expedition will last a long time, cost at least 50,000 tomans and may or may not be successful (moreover this year Khans have no ammunition lor their guns). For reasons Cox has given in his memorandum of June 30th, I most strongly recommend that we should give the Khans the military assistance they ask for. The destruction of Kaleh ilaisi 8 miles west of Dishmuk (10 I s{ l^ a ^ b 3) and Kaleh Lender 7 miles north of Dis Mardan (sheet 10 J square C 2) would suffice to bring Kuhgelus to heel. From military point of view neither is likely to prove difficult, to by past history of Bakhtiari-Kubgelu hostilities (e g., reduction of stronghold Likak by Jang in 1914). Khans would guarantee to provide force of 3,000 or more. Time for expe dition at end of December. Our force could he moved up to Tembeh immediately and part of it could if necessary be left there wdien expedition takes place. If this proposal be accepted, defence of oil fields would be combined with an enormous consolidation of our position in Bakhtiaristan, the confidence or Khans would be gained and they would be placed under a big obligation to us, the safety of Lynch’s road would be ensured and Sykes would be helped in Fars. If on the other hand we merely occupy Tembeh w r e shall incur consider able unpopularity and the mistrust and suspicions of the Khans would be excited.

To bring it to a successful conclusion our efforts must he concentrated against vital points and these points should he as few in number as possible so as to make our weight felt. If we are dravm into minor enterprises where our interests are not actually being threatened it will mean that our resources both in men, money and stores will he dissipated and the more this is done the more the effect will b reflected in all areas where we are fighting and the less decisive will he the result which we achieve.

Your 23374 Cipher of 30th September. X think that In regard to the protection of the oil fields you should understand the policy which has been followed. The safeguarding of the pipe line does not matter much as any damage effected is easily repairable but damage to the pumping station would result in the closing down of the oil fields for a very considerable time. Up to the present the custody of the plant has been entrusted to the Bakhtiaris, which course was adopted I believe from political motives, ^here is no reason to apprehend that the tribesmen are likely to tamper with the plant in which they have a pecuniary interest but serious darrage might be inflicted by an ill-disposed person or gang if sufficiently bribed. In matters where close protection to property is needed tribesmen supervision is notoriously loose. I suggest therefore that the additional protection conferred by a regular guard is desirable. I do not think we should need a greater force than that required to supply guards over important points and their reliefs so long as the Bakhtiaris 1 attitude remains satisfactory. To give effect to this suggestion should it be approved would need the assent of the Persian Government I understand in order to ensure that no suspicion ehould be aroused among section of the Bakhtiaris now friendly to us. I presume that you will arrange this with the Foreign Office and that a decision will be conveyed direct to Maude, with whom as well as with Cox I have discussed this matter.

Sir, We have the honour to refer to your despatch Secret No. 27, dated the 10th Decemher 1915, wherein, with reference to the protection of the Anglo- Bersian Oil Company’s oil-fields and pipe-line in South-West Persia, you desire to be furnished with our views on the recommendations contained in the inter-departmental Committee’s report of the 8 th October 1915. 2. Our views are as follows (e) We agree with the recommendations of the Committee that the following measures should be carried out by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, viz., (a) a cart road to he made from Halila via Abganji to the foot of the Anjirak Kotal (8 miles), (&amp;) a water pipe to he laid from the Karun at Halila to the foot of the Anjirak and a Burj with pumping power inside to be erected at or near this point; (&lt;?) a good mule road to be made up the Anjirak and thence along the oil pipe-line to the Ab-i-Tembi (distance about 12 miles). Such measures, when carried out, will considerably facilitate any military measures which might have to be taken for the protection of the oil-fields now or later. We note that the question of the improvement of the water supply of the oil-fields has already been taken up by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and trust that it will be carried out as early as possible. (ii) As the arrangements proposed by the Committee have in view more settled and permanent conditions and are not applicable to the existing state of affairs,* and as it is impossible to forecast what will be the situation in Mesopotamia, Arabistan and Persia at the end of the war, it seems to us premature to express any opinion regarding the military dispositions that will eventually be necessary for the protection of the oil-fields and pipe-line. * T ide last sentence of your Despatch -^o.27 of 10th December 1915 and your telegram No. 3128, dated 9th November 1915.

Ihe provision of such a farce is, they venture to j urge, not only of vital importance for the protection of the Oilfields, but also for the protection of the troops now operating on the Tigris and for the preservation of British prestige genera)!; in Per Mesopotamia, Afghanistan and India* j The Company's Agent - nr.

The dangers of such a movement are obvious. An active propaganda, supported by a free expenditure of money, has been carried on among these tribes for the past 12 months, and they are ripe to respond to the German call at any moment. Among them there would be no difficulty in gathering together a force of some 0 to 30,fu. horsemen all of them armed with their own rifles end ammunition. whether the Germans would be able to euppw them with any guns is not very certain. In all probability none coiad be brought down from Isfahan by the l akh- tiari road owing to tne snows, but it is quite | possible Umt mignt oe got through from Pag by the i usht-i-Kuh road to Dizful. In any case such a force would be a serioue menace to our troops now operating on the Tigris, as it would be practicable for them to strike from time to time at difference points of our lin'es of communica* r ' ■ -- - 4? tionCGfHBunication, or rven to attack 1 usra find/or Mohairmerah itself, and/or our !*efineries at Abadan, koreovei, the moral effect of a capture of the Giliields, and/or of any one or more of tiie above possible events, upon the political situation both in i ii sia and in India would, it is needless to point out, be grave in the extreme. ua the other hand my Board are of opinion that if one Brigade out of the reinforcements now arriving at the i ersi&amp;n Gulf be told off to the Karun Valley the presence ol such a British force there would effectually deter the tribee in question from succumbing to the persuasions of the German Agents who are now so active in southern i ersia, ana thus prevent the latter from effecting a junction with, or lending any effective aid to, the lurks with whom we are now ( engaged in Mesopotamia. A brigade so employed out of the reinforcements now being sent up would, in the opinion of my Board, and of others whom they have consulted and whose opinions are entitled to great weight, be of infinitely greater service to the main operations on the Tigris - dire as the necessities of the latter are • than would be the addition of that body of troops to the main force. As a separate matter aiy Board are strongly of opinion that, as a check to further German aggression in southern Bersia, and its consequent very serious effects upon the political and military situation generally in the aet, it is very essential that no time should be lost in appointing as Governor of oneGuarantees, some prominent end strong Persian who would undertake # with the support of a soldi British force, to raise a sufficient tody of Persian tribes- Fien to counteract the activities of the Germans in Isfahan, Shiraz, Yezd, Kerman, etc. But ns this is a matter which is not of such vital importance to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, as the protection of the Karun Valley - although so long as German activities are allowed to continue anywhere in Gouthem Persia they are alYmys a potential danger to the Company - my board do not, in view of the difficulty of providing further troops, desire at the moment to urge this point very strongly, although they are of opinion that a further 2 # GOG troops spared from tne reinforcements for this field of operations would, together with the provision of a brigade for the Kanin Valley and the small force now operating in Geietan, completely solve the present difficulties in southern Persia.

Although the present acting Il-Khani and Il-3egghi (Sirdars Mutashem and Mujahid) of the Bakhtiaris have apparently been won over by the Germans it has been suggested that it may still be practicable, with a sufficient pecuniary inducement, to gain the support of Sirdar Assad, Samsam-es-Sultaneh and Sirdar Bahadur (now in Teheran) whose influence with the Bakhtiari tribes is no doubt much greater than that of the first named Khans and the gaining of whose assistance would probably counteract the pro-German sympathies oj. ohe latter.

Until, as you say, the German Agents up-country he removed, we cannot hope to see any improvement in the situation, which is growing daily worse. The impression at home would appear to he that only her powerlessness to do so, prevents the Persian Government from at once suppressing German intrigue: this, at any rate, is the impression gained in reading their various statements made in the House of Commons. That the Persian Government Is powerless in this and in practically all other respects we do not V dispute, hut that her Government is a well-meaning, much- maligned institution we cannot agree. Reports received from Mr. Soane and others shew that German intrigue is making rapid progress and that the country is now almost to a man pro-German: the populace would seem now to have been convinced that the ultimate issue of the war will he in favour of Germany and this, coupled with the fact that the German Agents 1 Stock of 'backsheesh' appears to he inexhaustible has, in so far as the middle and lower classes are concerned, won the day. As regards those in authority, we will express no opinion on those resident in Teheran, such as Sirdar Assad, Samsamis-Sultaneh and others: of the other Khans, however, - Sirdar Jang, Sirdar Muhtashem, Amir-Mujahid etc. - we regret having to express our firm conviction that all are pro-German: Mr. Soane is firmly of that opinion, and even Dr. Young is nownow losing faith in Sirdar Muhtasham. Sirdar Bahadur &lt;• v and Amir Jang are still unknown quantities and it remains to he seen whether they will not go with the rest. Last week we telegraphed you that war with Persia might occur at any moment: this, in virtue of a message from the British Minister to H.B.M.'s Consul, shewn to us hy the latter in original. Your telegram of 3rd instant indicates that you have taken up the matter very strongly with the Authorities at home, who have, however, as we would have expected, been unable to hold out to you any hopes that material assistance in the way of a Military force would be forthcoming at present. We have discussed the whole situation with Mr. Holland (recently appointed Deputy Chief Political Officer) and with H.B.M. '&amp; Consul here, who, it need scarcely be said, realise to the full, the various points cited in your message, viz: that the immediate despatch of - say - a Brigade to maintain order in Arabistan and at the Oil Fields, would nip in the bud a general rising of the tribes, which would, otherwise eventually require a far larger force to subdue. The War Committee and the Indian Government are, you tell us, of opinion that it would be useless to take action against Persia, with a force of less than two Divisions, and here no doubt, they are correct, assuming (as you say) that the intention were to carry out a compre hensive campaign, invading the interior etc., etc. i&lt; protect British interests in Persia, is, as stated in your telegram the primary consideration, and for tnis purpose you are of opinion that two Brigades - one for Arabistan and one for Coast-ports - would suffice. A regardsZK) regards teidan-i-Naftun, we do not think there is the slightest chance that a force would he sent there, and although we duly impressed upon the Authorities, not only the vast losses both in time and money which abandonment of the Oil Fields would entail, but also the very great advantage which by their acquirement an enemy force would secure (i.e. a powerful Wireless installation, a first-class workshop, housing accommodation etc. etc.) neither Mr. Holland nor Colonel Kennion flere able to hold out the least hope that the Military would alter their decision in this respect. To this effect we have wired you, referring you at the same time to our (Ahwaz Manager's) D/O 'Political' letter of June 10th setting forth the views of General Wapshare in the matter. On 4th November, at Mr. Gillespie's express request, we wired, asking for your immediate and express instructions as to whether or not Fields should be abandoned, in case such a step seemed necessary. You will doubtless reply that we must be guided by the advice of the Political Resident, but, in view of the criticism by the latter of Mr. Gillespie's action in this respect in February last, when the British Colony abandoned Ahwaz, it is not unnatural that he should ask for your specific instructions in the present instance.'COPY OF A TELEGRAM FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA TO SIR JOHN NIXON t DATED 3RD DECEMBER 1915.

The Committee was constituted as follows :— General Sir E. Barrow, G.C.B. (India Office). Vice-Admiral Sir E. Slade, K.C.I.E., K.C.V.O. (Admiralty). Col. the Hon. M. (T Talbot (War Office). Mr. E. Oliphant (Foreign Office). ]\Ir. J. E. Shuckburgh (India Office). o Phe general position with regard to the Anglo-IVrsian Oil Company’s conces-ion in Persia may be briefly stated. The Company was formed in 1909 to work a concession obtained from the Persian Government in 1901 by Mr. W. K. D’Arcy. which runs for 60 years from the 28th May 1901, and gives the exclusive right to drill for, produce, pipe, and carry away oil and petroleum products throughout the whole Persian Empire excluding the five Northern provinces (Azerbaijan, Ghilan, Mazanderan, Asterabad, and i\hor- assan). The only oil-fields at present being worked by the Company under this concession are situated in the neighbourhood of Maidan-i-Naphtun in the Bakhtiari country, whence the oil is conveyed in a pipe-line to the Company’s refinerv on Abadan Island at the head ot the Peisian Gull. Altoi leaving the Bakhtiari hills the pipe-line runs through a tribal area subject to the influence of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Under agreement with the Company the Bakhtiari Khans have undertaken to police and protect the field works and upper section of the-pipe line, while the Sheikh of Mohammerah is under a similar obligation in regard to the refinery and the lower part of the line. The Bakhtiari Khans are entitled, by agreement, to 3 per cent, of the shares in anv company formed to work oil m Bakhtiari counti}, and thus have a substantial interest in the success of the venture. In May 1914 an agreement was concluded between the Company and the Admiralty, by which the latter acquired a sufficient number of shares to give them a controlling interest in the Company’s operations. . ., , 3 fip to the end of 1914, the pipe-line was never interfered with; but m January and February of the present year ('onsiderablejdamage was done by the Bawi an Arab tribe then in revolt against the Sheikh ol Mohaininerah, to the section lying between the Bakhtiari border and Ahwaz. Ihe damage has since been repaired, and the Bawi have made their suomission to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and have formally accepted responsibility for the security of the pipe-line, telephone line and the Company’s employees, m return loi '.'hich a subsidy of 1,0001. has been granted to the tribe. Ihe Bakhtiau.-, have so far fulfilled their engagements; but in May 1915, when a rupture with the Persian Government seemed imminent, it was thought desirable to execute a further agreement with the Khans, by which they imclertook, in the event of hostilities between Great Britain and Persia, and of their themseives no longer in a position to afford the necessary protection, to gne the head of the oi fi • ds community 20 davs’ notice in advance, and to be responsible for the safety of the Company's employees during those 20 days. The agreement was dated the 24th May 1915. It may be mentioned that the population at the oil fields consists of some 1,000 souls, including 10 Kuropeans^ I In the event of disturbances m Persia endangering the oil-helcls, it s considered that half-measures would be useless, and that only two practicable courses are open to us, viz. : ( 1 ) To despatch a military force sufficiently strong to defend the holds and vn tvo- 11 iie against all comers . 01 . (9) To shut down the fields and withdraw the personnel until such tmie as the Bakhtiaris are in a position to resume then engagemen s.

Ml ««i tlm goldeni&gt; ” But ns against this view, it must be borne m mind that the tribe may be offered inducements by our enemies which will more than outweigh any losses incidental to the destruction o£ the oil-lields. 5 'pbe Committee having considered the marginally-noted reports ' from the General Officer Commanding, Indian Ex peditionary Force “ D, 1 ' and having heard the views of Vice-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, who is personally acquainted with local conditions in the districts concerned, resolved unanimously to submit the following conclusions for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government : — (1 ) That the estimates—varying from one to two divisions of the iorce requisite to defend our interests in the Anglo-Persian oil-fields, which have been submitted by the military authorities in Force “ D,” are excessive in oxr«rv rf'snep.t. ns thev do not take sufficient account oi : * better No. 304/4/0, dated 19th dune 1915, with enclosures. Telegram No. 304/5/0, dated 27th June 1915. , , r Letter No. 304 d 0, dated *27th June 1915, with enclosures. J (a) The fact that the Chaab and Bawi tribes are unlikely to act against us after the recent lessons they have received, so long as we maintain adequate forces for their repression, and so long as we are in alliance with the Sheikh of Mohammerah ; (b) The fact that the Bakhtiaris are unable to concentrate against us in large numbers and have no guns, while the Persian Government have practically no armed force of any value ; (c) The fact that if we hold the portable water supply at the oil-fields no sustained attack on us can be made there. (2.) That for the above reasons, if Persia declared war, and if “jehad” were proclaimed, a brigade with a few mountain guns would suffice to hold the oil-fields and the water supply against any probable or possible attack, while a couple of battalions with a proportion of guns and cavalry could hold the Karim line up to and including lialila. (3.) This being so, the Committee consider that, provided that certain measures as proposed below are now taken, we can always rely on being able to detach a sufficient force for this duty so long as we maintain in the Basra- Ahvvaz region a force of not less than two brigades of infantry, two regiments of cavalry, and two batteries of Morse and Mountain Artillery. 0. On these premisses the Committee make the following recommendations. Measures to be taken at once. 1. The Karim to be recognised as the line of communications up to Jlalila, and for the purpose two steamers and barges to be placed on the river above Ahwaz. IT. The post now at Ahwaz to he transferred to Xasiri on the left bank. III. A cart road to be made from Halila via Ab-Ganji to the foot of the Anjirak Kotal (8 miles). TV. A water pipe to be laid from the Karim at llalila to the foot of the Anjirak and a Burj with pumping power inside to be erected at or near this point. A. A good mule road to be made up the Anjirak and thence along the oil pipe-line to the Ab-i-Tembi. The distance is about 12 miles. Of these measures, III., I\ . and \ . should be carried out by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. 1 . and 11. are essentially matters for military action and expenditure. Measures to be taken when war threatens. ^ 1. A force to be despatched without delay to the oil-fields. This force to comprise :— A brigade of Infantry. One or two sections of Mountain Artillery. A company of Sappers and Miners.7 2/^ Tliis force might have to detach a battalion to hold the water supply at Maidan-i-Naphtak. It would also have to furnish a detachment for Ab-Ganji and provide all escorts and picquets from Ab-Ganji to the oil-fields (13 miles). VII. The cart road from Darra Khazina via Ab-Gah to Ab-i-Tembi to be abandoned as it runs through an indefensible defile. VIII. Fortified towers or posts to constructed at the Kotals for guards and picquets and a defensible post at Ab-Ganji for a double company. IX. Two battalions and a cavalry regiment to be detailed for guarding the line Ahwaz-Halila. A post to be formed for a quarter battalion and one squadron at Halila and a similar post at Bandi Kir or Mulla Thaneh. The rest to be concentrated at Nasiri (vide II). 7 . The whole of these proposals are subject to the condition laid down in paragraph 5 (3) that a certain force is always maintained in the Basra-Ahwaz region. This condition would not apply if we were in possession of Bagdad, as in that case the maintenance of normal order in the Bakhtiari hills would appear to be assured. E. G. Barrow, General. Edmond J.

I am Sir, Your obedient servant,(D 22 OCT 1915 mam oiL-yBLos. &amp;c . 1. An inter-departmental Committee representing the Admiralty, War Office, Foreign Office and India Office, met at the India Office on the 3rd October 1915 to consider the question of the defence, in various event ualities, of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s oil-fields and pipe-line in South-Y/estern Persia. The Committee was constituted as follows:- General Sir E,Barrow, G.C.B. (India Office) Vice-Admiral Sir E,Slade, K.C.I.E.,K.C.V.O. (Admiralty) Col. the Hon. M.G.Talbot. (War Office) 2. The general position with regard to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s concession in Persia may be briefly stated. The Company was formed in 1909 to work a concession obtained from the Persian Government in 1901 by Mr # W.K.D ! Arcy, which runs for 60 years from the 28th May 1901, .and gives the exclusive right to drill for, produce, pipe, and carry away oil and petroleum products throughout the whole Persian Empire exelud-ing the 5 Northern provinces (Aseroaijan, Ghilan, Iiazanderan, Asterabad and Khorassan). The only oil-iields at present being worked by the Company under this concession are situated in the neighbourhood of Maidan-i-Naphtun in fue uak^tiari f &gt;r ‘M, y 'i , ; . . country, whence the oil is conveyed, in a pipe.-line to uhe Company’s refinery on Abadan Island at the head of the Persian Gulf. After leaving the Bakhtiari nills ohe pipe line runs through a tribal area suoject oo the influence lir.L.Oliphant. (Foreign Office) hr. J.E.Shuckburgh (India Office). of( 2 ) of the Sheikh of Moharanerah. Under agreement with the Company tne Baklitiari Khans have undertaken to police and protect the^field works and upper section of the pipe-line, while the Sheikh of Mohanmerah is under a similar obligation in regard to the refinery and the lower part of the line. The Bakhtiari KhaiiS are entitled - b y agreement, to 3 per cent, of the shares in any Company fomed to work oil in Bakhtiari country, and u Uo have a suostantial interest in the surrpcsc, n -p ^el.ded bew. u,. Coy Ventu ™. !n May 1914 an agreement,, by which the' letter ac^ed a sufficient number of shares to give them a controlling interest in the Company's operations. 3. Up to the end of 1914, the pipe-line was never interfered with; but in January and February of the present year considerable damage was done by the Bawi, an Arab tribe ^ then in revolt against the Sheikh of Mohammerah, to the section lying between the Bakhtiari border and Ahwaz. The damage has since been repaired, and the Bawi have made their submission to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and have formally accepted responsibility for the security of the pipe-line, telephone line and the Company's employees, in return for which a subsidy of £1000 has been granted to the tribe. The Bakhtiari.s have so far fulfilled their engagements; but in May 1915, when a rupture with the Persian Government seemed imminent, it was thought desirable to execute a further agreement with the Khans, by which they undertook, in the event of hostilities between wrea.t Britain and Persia, and of their finding themselves no longer in a position to afford the necessary protection, bo give the head of the oil-fields community 20 day's’ notice in advance and to be responsible for the safety £ —safety of the Company^ employees during those 20 days. The agreement was dated the 24th May 1915. It may be mentioned that the population at the oil-fields consists of some 1,000 souls, including 40 Europeans. 4. In the event of disturbances in Persia endangering the oil-fields, it is considered that half-measures would be useless, and that only two practicable courses are open to us, viz:- (1) To despatch a military force sufficiently strong to defend the fields and pipe-line against all comers; or (2) To shut down the fields and withdraw the personnel until such time as the Bakhtiaris are in a position to resume their engagements. The political objections to abandoning so important &lt;x*v ^interest, or, in Sir P. Cox’s words, 'leaving a large 'and valuable settlement, representing some millions of 'money, to be wrecked', are sufficiently obvious, and there is the further consideration that the Admiralty attach great importance to the continued supply of oil from the Persian fields for naval purposes. It has been argued that the Bakhtiarts, being financially interested in the enterprise, are unlikely w in any circumstances 'to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs'. But, as against this view, it must be borne in mind that the tribe may be offered inducements by our enemies which will more than outw^yh an}r losses incidental to the destruction of the oil-fields. 5.

' \ ) Edmond Slade, who is personally acquainted with local conditions in the districts concerned, resolved unanimously to submit the following conclusions for the consideration of His Majesty's Government:- (1). That the estimates - varying from one to two Divisions - of the force requisite to defend our interests in the Anglo-Persian Oil fields, which have been submitted by the military authorities in Force M D** are excessive in almost every respect, as they do not take sufficient account of:- (a) the fact that the Chaab and Bawi tribes are unlikely to act against us after the recent lessons they have received^so long as we maintain adequate forces for their repression^and so long as we are in alliance with the Sheikh of Mohammerahj (b) the fact that the Bakhtiarisare unable to concentrate against us in large numbers and have no guns, while the Persian Government have practically no armed force of any value; (c) the fact that if we hold the potable water supply at the Oil-fields no sustained attack on us can be made there. ( 2 ). That for the above reasons^ if Persia declared war and if 'jehad* were proclaimed, a nrigade with a few mountain guns would suffice to hold the Oil-iields and the water supply against any probable or possiole atuacK^ while a couple of battalions with a proportion of guns andstasa and Cavalry could hold the Karun line up to and including Halila. («:). This being so, the Committee consider that^provided that certain measures as proposed below are now taken, we can always rely on being able to detach a sufficient force for this duty so long as we maintain in the Basra- Ahwaz region a force of not less then 2 Brigades of Infantry, 2 regiments of Cavalry, and 2 batteries of Horse and Mountain Artillery. 6. On these premisses the Committee make the following recommendations:- Measures to be taken at once: - I. The Karun to be recognised as the line of communica tions up to Halila, and for the purpose 2 steamers and harges to be placed on the river above Ahwaz. II. The post now at Ahwaz to be transferred to Nasiri on the left bank. III. A cart road to be made from Kali la vi&amp; Ab-Ganji bo the foot of the Anjirak Kotal (8 miles). IV. A water pipe lo be laid from the Karun at halila to the foot of the Anjirak and a Burj with pumping power . * inside to be erected at or near this pomu. V. A good mule road to be made up the Anjirak ana thence along the Oil pip© line to the Ab-i-iembi. The distance is about 12 miles. Of these measures, III, IV and V should be carried out by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I and II are essentially matters for military action and expenditure. Measures to be taken when war thr eatenfe.- VI. A force to be despatched without delay to the Oil fields. This force to comprise:-A B C. A Brigade of Infantry. 1 or 2 sections of Mountain Artillery. A Company of Sappers and Miners. This force mijit have to detach a battalion to hold the* water supply at Maidan-i-Haphtak. It would also have to furnish a detachment for Ab-Ganji and provide all . escorts and Picquets from Ab-Ganji to the Oil-fields (13 miles). VII. The cart road from Barra Khazina via^ Ab-Gah to Ab- i-Tembi to be abandoned as it runs through an indefen sible defile. VIII. Fortified towers or posts to be constructed at the Kotal s' for Guards and Picquets and a defensible post at Ab-Ganji^for a double Company. IX. Two battalions and a Cavalry Regiment to be detailed for guarding the line Ahwaz-Kalila. A post to be formed for a i battalion and 1 squadron at Halila and a similar post at Bandi Kir or Mulla Thaneh. The rest to be concentrated at Nasiri (vide II). The attached map .shows the places mentioned above.. 7. The whole of these proposals are subject to the condition laid down in *(3) that a certain force is always A maintained in the Basra-Ahwaz region. This condition would not apply if we were in possession of Bagdad, a.s in that case the maintenance of normal order in the Bakhti- ati hills would appear to be assured. ^ t v r- ■ iff.information of the Secretary of State for India in Council that the question of the improvement of the water supply of the oil fields in Arabistan has 1 already been taken up by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that estimates have been prepared for laying a pipe to the fields from the river. 3.

Cox and the Military Staff Officers, contained in the enclosure to India Foreign Secretary’s letter 33 M. of the 14th August. They concur generally in Sir Percy Cox’s Minute of the 18th June and think that the conclusions drawn by the General Staff in India are based upon presumptions which are hardly justified in present circumstances. The most probable contingency appears to be that the Bakhtiaris will remain loyal to their engagements to His Majesty’s Government, and that even should German influence succeed in stirring up the country against us, they will not go so far as to damage their own interests. In that case a comparatively small force will suffice to keep lawless bands from damaging the pipe line , and in consequence the serious measures suggested by the General Staff as being necessary if any intervention is undertaken will not be required. 3. - For these reasons My Lords would strongly deprecate the removal of troops from Ahwaz for the present.

Letter No. 304*4-0, dated 19th (received 28tft) June 1915. From—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D”, Basi^h. To—The Chief of the General Staff. [Diary No. S. I 34 2 3') I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, correspondence and military reports regarding the military action necessary for the security and maintenance of the Oil Fields and pipe line in the event of the Persian Government proclaiming Jehad. 2 . Although active hostilities by the Bakhtiaris would seem contrary to their own interests and consequently appear unlikely, the possibility of the tribe being forced to join in Jehad was represented to me (vide papers attached), and the contingency had therefore to be considered. 3 . As regatds the military action which might be required, I am not in favour of half measures. In the event of disturbances in Persia endangering the Oil Fields, and of the Bakhtiaris giving the promised 20 days’ notice that they could no longer protect that concern, two courses only commend themselves to me, viz :— (a) To despatch such a military force to guard the pipe line and the Oil Fields as will be capable of dealing with any combination or dis turbance which might endanger the pipe line ; (h y To shut down the Oil Fields temporarily and to withdraw' the person nel, until the Bakhtiaris resumed their engagements. 4 . As regards (a), it wdll be evident from the reports enclosed that the force required could not be furnished from the troops now at my disposal, although I do not subscribe to all the measures advocated. I also consider it doubtful, even if reinforcements w f ere available, whether j their arrival in time could be relied on. 5 . I am therefore in favour of course (3). For, even if the Bakhtiaris could not protect individuals in the event of Jehad, they would probably be able to prevent any serious damage to property in which they have an interest, and they have already learned from experience that the cessation of pumping and the waste of oil affect their pockets. In the event of any disturbance short of Jehad, I do not consider that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has anything to fear from the Bakhtiaris, so long as we do not put military posts and detachments in Bakhtiari territory. 6 . As regards the other tribes I see no reason to apprehend any hostile action with which the force at Ahw'az could not promptly deal, so long as the general situation remains as at present; but I am trying to conclude early arrangements with all tribes along the pipe line which w r ill give them, like the Bakhtiaris, an interest in the maintenance and security of the pipe line down to Abadan. At the present moment a portion of my force is more or less locked up in Persian territory to which a separate line of communications has to be maintained, but as soon as the arrangements I advocate are in working order there would seem no military reason for keeping any troops on the Karun River. In view of the advantages to be gained by tribal responsibility for the pipe line, I trust that these papers may be placed before the Foreign Department of the Government of India.

The Army Commander wishes either you or General Wapshare to visit the Oil Fields and report on the best disposition of troops to safeguard the Oil Fields and pipe line throughout to Abadan in such an emergency. You should place yourself in communication with Mr. Gillespie as to the best way of inspecting the Oil Fields and pipe line. The Army Commander would be glad of an early report by wire giving your opinion as to the number of troops which should be retained at and in advance of Ahwaz this summer, as on this will depend the number of troops from your Division which can safely be withdrawn. We have had no news from Persia for some days but the latest was un favourable and as long as the situation there continues unsettled the proclamation of jehad with its attendant hostilities is a contingency which has always to be reckoned with.Meirorandum by Sir P. Cox. The protection of the Pipe Line and Fields Settlement aj the A. P. 0. C. Previous to the recent outbreak in Arabistan the pipe line had never been interfered with. The damage done in January and February last all occurred between the Bakhtiari border and Ahwaz. No damage was done within Bakhtiari limits nor south of Ahwaz. This new departure on the part of the tribesmen of Arabistan was very probably instigated by Turkish or German agents, but having once been tried with success may again be resorted to when occasion is considered to demand it. For the present however local conditions have apparently returned to normal. The Bawi have submitted to the Shaikh of Muhammareh and have executed a written undertaking to keep the road open through their limits and accepting responsibility for the security of the pipe line, telephone line and the Com pany’s employes. (Copy attached.) The breaks in the line have so far been repaired as to enable the oil to pass through to Abadan, but there are still some leaks remaining, due probably to corrosion. I travelled down the line from the fields to Naseri and saw the working parties now out. The new arrangements for patrolling the line and guarding the camps have not yet had time to get into working order and there have been one or two thefts since the working parties went out, but no arrangement which depends on the vigilance of local Persian guards will be proof against occa sional instances of robbery. These however do not ordinarily amount to much and I think it is better to give the present arrangement some weeks trial before seriously contemplating the alternative of placing military guards along the line. The Company’s representatives are of the same opinion, I propose to send Cap tain Noel up now to take over the Consular post at Ahwaz, with special instruc tions to keep a close watch on the progress of affairs on the pipe line and keep the Shaikhs concerned up to their obligations. I saw General Gorringe at lllah and he consulted me as to the advisability of sending for the Bawi Shaikhs and giving them a friendly warning, to the effect that while he had been glad to hear of their undertaking to the Shaikh he thought it advisable to caution them that if they did not act strictly up to it and if there should be any further trouble on the pipe line he would have to concern himself with them, and they had better take warning by the Beni Turuf. I told him I thought it would be best to let well alone for the present as the Bawi Shaikhs were still nervous and suspicious and afraid to come in personally to Naseri and that any message calling them in to see the General Officer Com manding might merely result in their clearing off. I recommended General Gorringe to wait until he came in to Naseri himself and then, after discussing the question with Shaikh Hanzal, to write a letter to them in the sense above indicated. 1 should mention that the Shaikh of Muhammareh and some others whose opinion is entitled to weight express the view that with reference to their attitude to the Shaikh of Muhammareh little confidence can be placed in the submission of the Bawi and they may give him trouble again when they have gathered their harvest and got rid of their spare grain. It does not follow however that they will give trouble to the Oil Company. Moreover, when things have gone on satisfactorily for a short time on the pipe line and the laying of the second pipe has fairly started, the Company can take up the matter of the subsidy, with a view to securing their good will. It would be better however that the Chaab should have been brought back to the fold before that is done. The foregoing observations assume that Persia will not join in the war on the side of our enemies. Should she do so the protection of the Oil Fields Settlement and the pipe line will become a more difficult problem, especially if the phenomenon occurs5 before the Chaab have returned to the fold or if Persia succeeds in raising fresh trouble in Arabistan. I attach a copy of an undertaking which I have taken from the Ilkhani and Ubegi of the Bakhtiaris which is all right so far as it goes. In the event of the warning of danger being given we should have the choice of withdrawing the community and leaving a large and valuable settlement representing some millions of money to be wrecked, or of sending troops to protect it. Supposing that we had river-boats available troops could be quickly pushed up to Derra Khazineh and landed there. But the road from there to the fields passes through most difficult country, and at present the water-supply question at the fields settlement itself seems to me to represent a great difficulty. At all events it needs specific examination if there is any possible chance of troops having to be sent there. At present the population at the fields is about i,ooo including 40 Europeans. They derive their water-supply from a number of wells in a neighbouring valley between 4 and 5 miles away, from which it is pumped up by a number of steam pumps worked by one engine and passed through pipes to the fields. There is at present no condenser but they have one at Tembi pumping station 3 miles away on the other side. The Manager thinks it would be a simple thing to rig up a condenser at the fields in case of emergency ; that might be all right for the present community but if troops were to go there we should want to have a cut and dried plan either for holding the present water supply or for devising an emergency one. Then there is the question of the wireless station the establishment of which at the fields is already sanctioned and which only awaits the provision of river transport to enable the plant to be taken up. The sooner this can be pro vided the better, if there is still any likelihood of Persia coming into the war. The question of guarding the pipe line is a more simple matter, but either in the case of the fields or the pipe line I find it difficult to make any suggestions as to the precise strength of the force which would be necessary for their pro tection. But I think that in case of war being declared by Persia the first thing to do would be to send a regiment, cavalry if possible, ^ at once to Barra Khazineh. It is situated in a piece of no-man’s land belonging neither to the Bakhtiaris nor to the Sheikh of Muhammareh. Neither would have any right to object; there is plenty of good water an ipen space and the presence of a regiment there would both give confidence o the community at the fields and steady the tribesmen of the surrounding country. I strongly recommend, however, that one or two military staff officers, clad n mufti if possible, so as not to excite comment or create unnecessary appre- icnsion, be sent up to the fields via Darra Khazineh to stu y e ne situation on the spot.

In accordance with General Staff Order No. 164.C.G. of 28th May iok 1 submit herewith a report on my reconnaissance from Ahwaz to the Oil Fields’ A more detailed report on the route is attached, together with Maps A and B * Tracing Attached. Map A is the property of the Oil Com- ... A , , P an y which I have promised to return to their representative at Muhammareh within i month. 1. The country may be conveniently considered in 2 sections: — (a) the plain country lying between the Karun river and the hills between Ahwaz and Darra Khazineh which is inhabited by Bavi Arabs Gunduzlu tribe. The Gunduzlu are Persians not Arabs. (b) the mountain country including the hills bordering the Karun valley and the mountains lying between them and the Oil Fields, and the mountains round the Oil Fields. These are inhabited by Bakhtiari Tribesmen. a. With regard to the Bavi and Gunduzlu country, it is generally speaking hard level plain suitable for motors except the portion from Khazineh (o*r Haddam) North, which is intersected by deep ravines, affording cover for hostile Arabs to collect. This is unsuitable for motors. I anticipate no particular difficulty in protecting the pipe line in the plains except against minor damage—by minor damage 1 mean the firing of a rifle into the pipe and setting fire to the oil. I understand this would require about two days to remedy. I can offer no suggestion which would guarantee absolute protection against such damage. I do not think that large number of posts and constant patrolling would attain the desired result, and want of water precludes this course being adopted. I suggest that villages in the vicinity be held responsible that in case of damage to the line they are liable to severe punishment involving the prohibi tion of cultivation within 5 miles of the pipe line. The patrolling at irregular intervals of the line by armoured motor cars would have, I consider, great effect. I suggest also the establishment of posts as follows:— At Moola Thaneh—one double company and one squadron. At Abgunji—one double company, At Darra Khazineh—one double company and one squadron which would require to be strengthened to one or two battalions in event of the Bakhtiaris joining in. These posts, together with a movable column at Ahwaz, would I conside have great moral effect and would provide the necessary escorts, etc., to repair* ing parties and patrols. I would point out that in event of the ^ Bakhtiaris being hostile the above measures for the protection of the pipe line in the plain country would be all the more necessary. 3. As regards the Bakhtiari country, the main cart route from the Karun to the oil fields from a point where it enters the hills about 4J miles from Darra Khazineh to the oil fields is practically a defile, commanded at short range by hills. The last 20 miles from the Tembi river, near Batwand, to the oil fields are especially difficult. Every inch of the road is commanded by steep hills and transverse spurs from 5 GO to 1,000 feet above the road. The stream is forded 32 times and is said to be impassable after rain. The water is salt and for 27J miles the only potable water is at Abgah in small quan tity ; at Batwand U good spring; at Tembi power house condensed water in small8 quantity. The above mentioned water supplies would suffice for small numbers of men only. Before the Oil Company built the cart road the main route was the caravan route to Shuster, a pack mule track from the oil fields vid Maidan Napthak to Batwand near which it joined the present cart road from Tembi river to Abgah. This route in fairly open for 2 or 3 miles west of Tvlaidan Napthak, after which it becomes a very difficult defile to Batwand. The only potable water is at Batwand—one very small and uncertain spring between Batwand and Maidan Napthak, and springs when Maidan Napthak is reached. On this road also the water supply is small. A third route exists from Tembi to Abgunji which follows the pipe line* This Ts a good pack transport road 16 miles long, which crosses two mountain ranges, the Koishiah (at the Anjirak Pass) and the Chalbatun between the two ranges in the Ruhidarun plain, which affords excellent camping sites except for the fact that the fresh water supply throughout the route is totally insufficient for any body larger than a double company. The forcing of the Anjirak Pass in the face of opposition would be a formid able undertaking as would to a less extent, the forcing of the Chalbatun. This , route, however, compared with the Tembi River route, would be easy to safeguard. A strong post at Ruhidarun would probably suffice from which escorts from Tembi Power House and Abgunji could be met. The great difficulty however is water. I would urge that our position would be greatly strengthened if arrangements could be made for a Water supply at Ruhidarun. A pipe line for water pumped from the Karun at Halala has been suggested. I think the suggestion is well worth investigation. It could be put up by the Oil Company without exciting any suspicion and w’Ould indeed be of considerable use to them in their ordinary work. I am strongly of opinion that the quickest and best route for a force to the Oil Fields is by Abgunji and Tembi Power Station. In event of urgency the long and arduous march of 15 miles over two ranges without water would have to be faced, and the force would have to have pack transport. Were the Oil Company in the course of their ordinary business to arrange for a water supply at Ruhidarun, and this was suggested by Mr. Gillespie, the whole situation as regards the Oil Fields would be enormously j improved especially if the pipe line would enable a post to be built on the Anjirak. This it would be difficult to do now as there is no water. Such a line would also enable us to use Abgunji and perhaps a post on Chalbatun. 4. To protect the oil fields efficiently it would be necessary to provide for:— {a) The protection of the wells and the works at the fields ; {b) The protection of the water supply for the fields at Maidan Napthak 5 miles distant, it being borne in mind that all water in the vicinity of the fields themselves is salt, (c) The protection of the oil pumping and power station at Tembi. (d) The protection of the pipe line itself from the fields to Abgunji. (e) The supply of all forces employed on the above duties, and the pro tection of supply convoys. 5. Regarding the protection of the oil fields, Tembi, and their water supplies, one or two battalions finding a double company at Tembi would I think suffice for local protection, provided that a sufficient supporting force to tackle the Bakhtiaris was within close supporting distance. Considering the requirements of drinking and service water to enable the Oil Company to keep going the present supply, which is pumped 5 miles from Maidan Napthak, would not allow of more than one or two at most battalions being posted at the fields. The only suitable camp for a supporting force, and within easy reach of it, would beat Maidan Napthak or Chasnt Ali.The strength of this force must depend on supply and the strength of hostile I opposition to be expected. I do not consider however if the Bakhtiaris are in full force less than a Brigade advisable. A Brigade is about the number for which water suffices at Maidan Napthak. This would have the advantage of being on the only available supply of drinking water in the vicinity of the fields while denying it to any large concentration of the enemy. It would also to some extent assist movement along the old caravan route to Shuster via Batwand, and ^ might assist in deterring tribesmen from holding up convoys, etc., in the Tembi defile. The Maidan Napthak camp would also form a suitable position to fall back on in event of the Oil Fields being abandoned. If the main cart route is used for supply as I anticipate it must be eventually, what ever be the first line of advance, strong posts, strength depending on the strength of Bakhtiari gatherings, would also be required at Batwand and Abgah. 6. If we wish to secure the routes permanently 1 think it will be necessary to build permanent picquet posts at frequent intervals on the more commanding points on the road. To supply these with water will be a difficult operation and this leads me to prefer the Tembi Abgunji route. This could only be done pro vided a pipe line were arranged. 7. It has been pointed out to me, and I think it probable, that the despatch I of any force to the Oil Fields before the Bakhtiari declare hostile intentions may precipitate matters. I am unable to offer a definite opinion on this political I question, but I can see no great object in bringing a force into the fields before it J can be supported, as otherwise it would be certainly cut off and the most difficult j and excessive operations of forcing difficult defiles to relieve it would have to s be undertaken. The Oil Company officials at the Fields are very confident that | the Bakhtiari will stand by us. 8. I am of opinion that :— If the Bakhtiari declare against us, which appears unlikely, at least one Division suited for mountain warfare should be available to keep the Oil Com pany working. To protect the line against the Bavi, I suggest posts of one double company I and one squadron at Moola Thanieh and Darra Khazineh. A movable column with transport should be maintained at Ahwaz. Armoured motor cars are also required. These should be apart from the Ahwaz garrison and will be all the more necessary if the Bakhtiari join against us. The Abgunji Anjirak Power Station route is best suited for military opera tions at the fields. Steps should be at once taken to provide water supply and this could be done by the Oil Company without raising suspicions which may precipitate matters with the Bakhtiari. Subsequently when a garrison is estab- lished at the fields, posts will have to be built and it may be necessary to use the main cart route.IO NOTE ON ROAD AHWAZ TO OIL FIELDS—JUNE 1915. Bavi Country. Ahwaz to Wais 16 miles. Level plain, good going for motor which could move anywhere off track— good deal scattered barley cultivation now being reaped. Several villages in plain on both sides of track. Wais, village of about 100 houses, mud baked walls, difficult to attack with shrapnel and proof against rifle fire—very little wood in construction, hence diffi cult to burn. Water from river. Wais is typical of other villages in plain—there appears to be considerable stores of barley and bhoosa. Children came out and threw stones, which may indicate real feelings of inhabitants, who however are now stated to be friendly. Shaikh Hanzals’ picquet in village. ' Wais to Moola Thanieh about 10 miles. Similar to country between Ahwaz and Wais. At Moola Thanieh, A.P.O.C. telephone station and stables destroyed by Bavi during recent troubles. Con venient place for post as near river and point where pipe line leaves river. Moola Thameh to Khazineh 12 miles or Haddam 9 miles. • Country more undulating and intersected by nullahs—track fit for motor ; but motor could not manoeuvre over plain or further south—track practically along pipe—numerous ravines and nullahs would afford cover to large bodies of tribes men. No village at Khazineh which is merely a point on a ravine marking the limit of an easy route for a motor. Khazineh approximately marks the northern limit of the Bavi Arabs, As regards the section of the track and pipe line above mentioned, it would be impracticable to ensure the absolute protection of the pipe line against minor damage—such as being pierced by rifle fire—the pipe is mostly buried ; but is easily accessible. This, it is estimated, would take two days to repair. The best protection would be to hold villages within 5 miles of the line responsi ble, and by taking severe measures to punish any damage. An entrenched post of one double company and one squadron at Moola Thanieh would probably have considerable moral effect. The actual patrolling of the line should be done by A. P. O. C. employees—escorts, etc., for repairing • parties could, however, be provided from Moola Thanieh or Ahwaz as found con venient and patrols by armoured motor-car, at irregular times would also have good moral effect. Gunduzlu tribe t more Persian than Arab. Haddam or Khazineh to Abgunji—about pj miles. Unfit for motor track fit for carts runs along foot of hills, ground undula ting and much intersected by ravines. Little barley cultivation, no water. Abgunji. Oil Company post.

Best position for a post already occupied by fort of Parvvez Khan (Gun- duzlu Chief who appears friendly being largely dependent on Oil Company) A convenient position for a post is situated about 400 yards south of Oil Com pany’s dep6t—this would command landing place—ample water from river— 20,000 maunds barley and straw after crops cut. Darrah Khazmeh.—'Yo foot of hills about 31 miles—good cart road which now runs across low hill avoiding detour and shortening distance to Abgah by 3 miles. At foot hills Bakhtiari country is entered. From foot of hills to watershed about 4 miles—the cart track follows Charbesha valley exactly similar to the valleys in the foot hills on the North-West Frontier of India—no potable water- cart track is fair—Oil Company’s block house on a hill south of the road com mands the entrance of the valley ; but the road would be most difficult to pro tect and would require very extensive picquetting— Watershed to Abgah down Gaosoar about 4J miles. Fair cart road—considerable picquetting required. Abgah 11\ miles from Darrah Khazineh. —Oil Company post—rest house and stables—Commanded at short range by low hills which surround the place. Water from well and stream both brackish, drinking water usually broughtf r °m Batwan, 5 miles. Sufficient grazing in winter and spring for mules—small quantities of barley and forage available if Bakhtiaris are frien dly. Abgah to Tembi —About 4J miles. . .

A spring, 600-800 gallons half way between Abgah and Fields, between 8th and 9th crossing. Poor grazing on hills-patches of barley cultivation at intervals. The whole of this section forms a most difficult defile as the road is commanded throughout at short range by steep hills-which rise from 400 to 1,000 feet above the road. A large force would be required to picquet or force road against opposition. I consider it as difficult country as any I have seen in Waziristan or Mohmand or Afndi country.

Underground springs in dry weather give about 10,000 to 12,000 gallons per diem which about suffices for requirements of Oil Company—water for mules (brackish) from stream close to oil fields. Pipe line to Maidan Napthak lies over undulating country and is vulnerable throughout—pumping station situated in an open plain easily defensible—a stream close to the pumping station is calculated to supply now i ,000 gallons an hour good water—this diminishes considerably in dry weather and sometimes dries except in pools. Maidan Napthak would form a very suitable camp. The number of troops accommodated would only be limited by the amount of water available (at present about a Brigade and Transport)—grazing good—no firewood except few bushes at source of stream, but troops would have to use oil. The source of the stream about miles beyond the pumping station would require guarding otherwise this water supply would be easily cut ofb A good camp site exists near source of stream. ^ Two or three^other good springs exist to the north of Maidan Napthak especially Chasm Ali which has been measured in dry weather to give 1,800 gallons per hour—Chasma Zuliak 100 to 120 gallons per hour, and as all other water in the neighbourhood of the oil fields is salt Maidan Napthak and the springs to the north of it would probably be used for hostile concentrations. A route said to be fit for pack mules, and as far as I could see fit for mules leads along the high ground north of the Tembi river to Batwand thence vid Abgah to Shuster—this route was formerly used for pack mules by the Oil Company. The descent to Batwand is said to be difficult and practically no wa t e r—until Batwand is reached—in some places route said to be commanded by hills. Taking into consideration water difficulties, the best way to locate troops to defend the oil fields would be 1 Battalion at the fields (about all water would suffice for in addition to Oil Company’s requirements) a double company at the Power House at Tembi—the bulk of the force about a Brigade at Maidan Napthak.

WAPSHARE, Brigadier^GeneraL S 1378 GSBi 4 No. i-X-S, S., dated Bahmanshir, the 16 th June 1915 . From—The General Officer Commanding, 12th Division, To—Major-General, General Staff, Indian Expeditionary Force ‘ D.' I forward herewith a report by Brigadier-General Wapshare on the recon* naissance carried out by him of the country between Ahwaz and the oil fields. 2. With regard to the numbers and disposition of troops required to safe guard the oil fields and pipe-line throughout in the event of a jehad 1: eing raised by the Persian Government most reliable information obtainable computes the probable number of rifles which could be put into the field by the Bakntiaris in the above contingency at between 5,000 and 20,000. To deal wiih a hostile force of Bakhtiaris and to prevent their damaging the pipe-line during daylight as well as the machinery of the oil fields in the area now guarded by them, at least one Division well equipped for mountain warfare and a Cavalry Brigade well trained as mounted riflemen, the whole equipped with pack mule transport, would be required. 3. The event of the being sufficiently powerful to sway the Bakhtiari Chiefs and their tribesmen against us presupposes the possibility of the Shaikh of Muhammareh’s influence being undermined to such an extent as to prevent his being able to keep control over the Bavi, Chaab and his own immediate auhe* rent?, who, it is probable, will have to be simultaneously and promptly dealt with by a striking force of a least one cavalry regiment, a Brigade of Infantry, with a Battery, Royal Field Artillery. 4. For patrolling the line between Abadan and Moola Thanieh armed motor cars and aeroplanes would be invaluable by day j but they would be effective only during the relatively peaceful conditions. A general rising would require military force of not less than those mentioned above. 5 The time of year when operations bad to be undertaken would greatly effect the conduct of the same. For example, during the dry season, water sup ply over the section between Moola Thanieh and the oil fields presents great difficulties to us. On the other hand during this same petiod dearth of water elsewhere forces the Arabs to camp near the river, limits their sphere of action, and would accord ingly facilitate our operations against them. » 6. In the Bakhtiari country a hostile force would be able to operate from the Karun River which lies only some 12 miles to the north and north-east of the oil fields 7. About 3 miles to the north-west of the oil fields good springs exist, those would have to be denied to a hostile force, and would it is understood suffice for one Brigade at least: with the above exception, and with the excep tion also of some small springs, adequate only for very small parties of men and animals, no natural drinking water exists between the vicinity of the oil fields and the Karun River, where it flows some 25 miles to the south and scuth-west near Haltla (some 6 miles down stream of Darra Khazineh). 8. I agree with General Wapshare that the best line of advance for us to take would be to follow roughly the line of the oil pipe. As far as Halilano water difficulties exist; but on leaving the river there special arrangements would have to be made for an artificial water-supply as far as the oil fields. I attach a note by my Divisional Engineer Commander on the water-supply and his recommend ations as regards the plant which would be required to enable adequate military forces to operate in the Bakhtiari country in the vicinity of the pipe-line and the oil fields. 9. It is however pointed out that if this force, estimated as above, were available to operate against the hostile forces against us, they would be quite inadequate to patrol by night along the pipe-line, and thus prevent individuals from damaging it, night after night. To ensure this nothing less thana line of block houses some 500 yards apart, wire entanglements on both sides •Allowing 10 per cent far s!ck, etc. would be adequate. This would entail at 8 nnes per block house from the oil fields to Abadan, about 6,coo* rifles. to. The total force required to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oil would be approximately two Divisions complete with Divisional Cavalry and in addition one Cavalry Brigade. ' (Sd.) G. F.

Now as to water on the road. Water must be pumped to the top of the tst ridge and will also be required the Libari Plain whe/there is an excellent camping ground. From the ,st ridge the water would run by gravity to w.thm about the top of the second ridge.Further than this it cannot go because air-valves are necessary just beyond the summit which would render any syphon arrangement impossible. Taking a 6' pipe loss by friction to top of ist ridge—159/ Height to be pumped is i,ico + 159 = 1,259 (In 5' pipe loss by friction = 412' which will make pressure too high for pumping) H.

Memorandum on Reports by Generals Wapshare and Gcr- ringe on the protection of the Pipe Line and Oil Fields. Terms of re- 1 ‘ Generals Gorringe and Wapshare were asked to report on the troops ference. and measures necessary to protect the oil fields and pipe line in the event of a Jehad being proclaimed in Persia and of the Bakhtiaris being forced to attack and damage the oil fields and pipe line. Nature of Re- 2. General Wapshare reconnoitred the country with Mr. Gillespie (Oil Fields connaissance. Manager), Lieutenant-Colonel H. P. Browne, G.S.O. (1), 12th Division, Captain Cusins, R.E., and Captain Grey, Intelligence Officer, Ahwaz. They proceeded by motor and on horseback from Ahwaz to Abgunji along the pipe line, thence to Darra Khazineh on horseback, thence by buggy along the cart road vid Abgah, Tembi to the oil fields. Lieutenant-Colonel Browne and Captain Cusins, R.E., then proceeded to reconnoitre Maidan-i Naphthun over the Anjirak to Abgunji and Ahwaz along the pipe line. The intelligence collected during this reconnaissance is very complete and valuable. # Protected 3. The gist of the report by General Wapshare and the covering memoran- commended re '^ um General Gorringe is to the effect that the troops and measures necessary to protect the Oil Fields and pipe line against the Bakhtiaris in the event of their actively joining a Jehad, would be at least one Division of all arms and a Cavalry Brigade, completely equipped with mule transport for mountain war fare, the construction of posts and a piped water-supply across the hills. To protect the Oil Pipe line against the Bavi and Chaab an additional force of a Brigade, a Cavalry regiment and armed motor-cars would be required. It is mentioned that attack by the Bakhtiaris is most unlikely and that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company deprecate the despatch of any troops into the Bakhtiari country until the necessity actually arises ; but is inclined to view with favour the provision ol a piped water supply from the Karun at Halala to Ruhidarun. Remarks on Report. | I 4. As operations against the Bakhtiaris (who can turn out 5,000 to 20,000 rifles) would take place in a difficult hill country very destitute of water, the force suggested cannot be said to be excessive as an abstract pro position. But unless the Government of India is prepared to reinforce very largely the force now in this^ country, and to supply some thousands of pack mules at very short notice, it is evident that such operations cannot be undertaken with safety from available resources. • 5 V ^ These considerations, and the information given in the Report point, however, to the conclusion that in the event of notice being given by the Bakhtiaris of their being forced to join in Jehad, it would be better to withdraw all non-Persian employes from the oil fields and to trust to the Bakhtiaris refraining from injuring property in which they have an interest, rather than to attempt to safeguard the oil fields by a military force. M understand that the Chaab do not actually (6) As regards the B ivi and ^Phaab come up to the pipe line and need not be con- tO k' ^ S , , , • CmaaD sidered. trie best pioiection would be to give these i • • i tribes also an interest in the undertaking and a warnmg that, in return the responsibility of villages will be enforced as suggested in paragraph 2 of General Wapshare’s Report. i? A Yf,f rd - S tl l e es Y blishmellt of P° sts in Bavi country and the patrolling of the pipe line by motor cars, it is questionable whether such measures are really necessary and desirable if tribal responsibility is to be given a trial 1“’ T vever ’ 1 P °, lnted 0Ut that efiectivel y to keep up connection between posts on the pipe line, the garrison at Ahwaz is now on the wrong side of the river. The present camp was originally placed on the right bank owing to the menace of Turkish aggression but now that this danger is not lon^-r to be eaied, there is no reason, escept the trouble and labour of shifting camp across the Karun, to justify its retention at Aminiyeh. P S.S. Bahmanshir; 1 (Sd.) G. V. KEMBALL, 16th June 191$. M.G., G.S.Enclosure No. 5. Protection of Anglo Persian Oil Company. The position seems to be this. His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to the maintenance of the supoly of oil to Abadan. 1 he maintenance of the said supply involves the protection of the Oil Fields Settlement and the pipe-line as well as Abadan itself. My note of 27th May suggested that in view of the still not impossible Contingency of Persia being drawn into the war, expert opinion should be obtained on the military aspects of the protection of the concern. The officers deputed were directed by Army Commander to report:— (t) As to the best disposition of troops required to safeguard the concern in the event of war at any time breaking out between Great Britain and Persia. (it) The number of troops which should be retained at Ahwaz this sum mer, under present circumstances, the contingency of war breaking out being uncertain. The conditions of war which the Committee contemplate in making their report are the most unfavourable to us that can be conceived. It is no doubt useful to have an estimate based on the most extreme circumstances possible but the conditions postulated are so extreme that they can hardly be regarded as coming within the range of practical probabilities at this juncture. They are as follows :— (*) The entry of the Persian Government into the war against us. (n) Participation of the Bakhtiari tribe in support of the Persian Govern ment. {Hi) Concentration and employment of the whole strength of the Bakh tiari tribe against the Oil Company’s concession. (w) Revival of Jehad and rebellion among the Arab tribes under the Shaikh of Muhammareh, and consequent danger to pipe-line in Arabistan. To safeguard the Oil Company against these contingencies the General Officer Commanding, 12th Division, considers, on the detailed report tefore him that the military requirements would be; two complete Divisions wit 1V Cavalry and one Cavalry Brigade. It is in any case valuable to know what our maximum requirements might be under the most unfavourable conditions, and the report makes it clear , from the military point of view the oil concession is a serious responsibly but on the one hand the general outlook has improved considerably since th bvestlgatlon was taken in hand, and in one or two instances the promises are or at any'rate have become, so unlikely to take shape, as hardly to need contem plation. 1 Thus, Persia may still be drawn into the war, in the same way that lurkey was, but the Minister now thinks it unlikely. The Bakhtiari Khans may still have to participate in loyal support of the Persian Government, but in the first place they ate , m “ ch ni ^ v '^ d Ba a ™° n a f i selves and never pull together, and secondly if war broke ou “ he ^ Ua , would at once be called upon to protect the Shah a nd Government and hold Isnahan • tffiv would in fact be wanted in many places other than the dil trac , and would not be able to put their whole strength or anything like it, into ie ow country. Moreover, as the Sardars Jang and Bahadur . endeavouredaSS “ f re th ^ recently, even if the Khans generally had to participate jnsuppon of t Government, yet they have their own methods of evading action in any d.rectio20 f If \ which does not suit their interests and the oil Fields are the last place they would molest seeing that it represents the goose which lays them golden eggs. At the same time if the tribe were co-operating with the Government it would be very difficult for a section of them actively to defend the English at the oil Fields against their own countrymen; that is why the two Khans said that when the point was reached that they could no longer do so, they would give us warning so that we could replace their guards by our own. But that the whole armed strength of the Bakhtiaris should be brought dowm to the low country and be launched against their own oil fields is a practical impossibility to my mind. Moreover as above stated, the general position has improved in several respects since the report was called for. Thus, (z) The Turks have finally cleared from Arabistan. (z’z) The capture of Amara has had a very salutary effect on pro- Turkish elements, and will have on the Tehran public. (izi) The news° of the behaviour of the Turks at Nejef and the rising of the populace against them has caused a revulsion of feeling against the Turks and in my belief gives the quietus to the Jehad movement as far as Iraq and Arabis tan are concerned. (iv) The Chaab tribe have been subdued by the Shaikh of Muham* march and Arabistan has practically returned to normal, or soon will have. I would sum up as follows : It does not seem that the extreme conditions postulated on which the esti mate of .2 Divisions is based need lively contemplation at the present time. If they have to be contemplated then it is clearly beyond the competence of Expeditionary Force “D” or of the Government of India at the present juncture, to safeguard the Oil Company against such contingencies. It would be much simpler to forestall action against the Oil Concession by occupation of Gulf Islands or Ports, and merely extricate our English employes and leave the Fields to the Bakhtiaris. They would hardly allow the settlement to be destroyed, but we should have to take our chance of that. In my judgment all we need contemplate for present purposes is— (i) That Persian Government may still be drawn into war. (n) That the Bakhtiati Khans may be obliged to support the Central Government, but that they would in a great measure be employed elsewhere and in any case would not attack the oil fields in force. {tii) That all we need do would be to keep sufficient troops at hand to enable us to protect the oil settlement against ordinary raids and lawlessness, in case of the Sardars Jang and Bahadur giving us the warning and taking away their guards. To meet the above requirements I would move no troops from Ahwaz until war was declared, when I would move a regiment to Derra Khazineh to show that | we were prepared and to act as a deterrent. If the Bakhtiaris gave their warn ing, I would send tw r o regiments to the Field, one for Naphtun and one for Naphtak, with a Field or Mountain Battery as might be considered expedient, the regiment at Derra Khazineh being retained there. If the regiment at Derra Khazineh were a cavalry regiment so much the better. It is unlikely in my opinion, now that they have come into the Shaikh and made peace with us that the Arabs on the pipe line would break out but they might indulge in lawlessness of a sporadic kind. I should recommend the use of cavalry patrols and armed motor patrols along the pipe line in the plains.

[Diary No. 13383.) With reference to my letter of 19th June, No. 304-4-0. When the atti tude of the Bawi was doubtful in February and their control was beginning' to become difficult, it was suggested that the payment of a subsidy to the Shaikhs, of the tribe to keep security and order along the pipe line where it passed through their territory would be to the advantage of the Oil Company. In a discussion which ensued the Company’s representatives were inclined to regard the idea with favour and expressed their opinion that for the purpose in view the directors would agree to the payment of ^300 per annum or even more. The Bawi then broke out into open rebellion and the project fell into abeyance. The idea has now been revived owing to the surrender of the Bawi and it was requested that the Political Agent should discuss it with the Agent of the Company. Now, however, the project is opposed on various- grounds by the Company’s Agent This change of attitude is probably due to the fact that the presence of our troops has restored the country to its nornaal state and it is believed that in future the pipe line will always be guarded by a British garrison, consequently the directors do not see any necessity to incur the expense. I have no doubt that it would be to the interest oi the Company to pay to the tribe a subsidy which would cause them to interest themselves in the safety of the line whether they were quarrelling or not with the Shaikh of Muhammareh. If the Company will not pay in the interests their business I think that it would be worth the while of the Government (?) to find the money. This we could allow the Company to pay out for us or, if the Shaikh aarees'pay it out ourselves. 1 request therefore that the matter may be- brought up in the London Chamber of Commerce for discussion with the d.rec- tors and that the result may be communicated to me.

V Sir, i»o lia.\n bi .0 ':onour to address you ill respect of tlie proposal mooted in late February of tins year, whereby the Bavi Chiefs were to receive an annual subsidy, payable nominally by the Company, in consideration of their undertaking to protect the Company^ iipe-line and other property, situated within the territory of this Tribe. At the time when this proposal was under consideration, it was not, we understand, on political grounds, considered practicable to adopt more than diplomatic measures; nor, in the then existing circumstances, could the Company afford to analyse too closely any project calculated to bring about the early resumption of its operations. Moreover, at that time, it was considered not unlikely that the Bavis would re-assume allegiance to the Shaikh of Lohamnerah, though this hope was not ultimately realiseo, • i.e Lavi continuing! in rehellion until such time as tne operations of tne British forces, in the neighbouring district, compelled the former to come to terms. In the circumstances we are, therefore, inclined bo one opinion that, if not wholly inadvisable, it is, at any rate, premature to contemplate offering any subsidy to the Bavi Chiefs ,j and this view is, we think, shared by our Directors at home. ♦In so far as our infomation goes, all is now quieo in the Aliwaz district, and the Bavi Chiefs not yet having oeen approached regarding the question ox a subsidy, we think that now to tak, such acti.n-which, apart fron eat.bliskl^j an undesirable precedent, would not, strictly speaking, t.-M. .with oar previous understanding witk the Shaikk ot i.ohaewran - | would be unfortunate.7 Sj&lt;d In saying that we are of opinion that the views, herein expressed, are shared hy our principals at hone, -e would say that we recently received a telegram from our hoard of Directors advising us, in view of the altered political conditions, to f defer taking any further action in regard to certain local Nj questions, of erstwhile importance, such as the revision of our agreement with the Dakhtiari Khans in lespecu of u-uaiding and it is, to a great extent, in consequence of these instruction^, that we deprecate the taking of any further action in connection ^ith the proposed subsidy to the Bavi Chiefs. We have, etc., For Anglo Persian Oil Coy. i^td., Strick Scott &amp; Coy. Ltd., Sd, C. a. Walpole, General manager.o or • O * ~ 1S a l8tter ^oei the .
