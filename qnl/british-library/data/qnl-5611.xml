I am sorry to nave been so long in replying to your letter P*Z.2172/34 of the 5th April, 1934, about' the communication of the Government Agreement to the Sheikh of Koweit. The Admiralty viev/s are very much the same as Starling*s, namely, that we would prefer to hold back the Agreement until the Sheikh has undertaken to give the concession to the Koweit Oil Company. If the Standard Oil Company of California got hold of the Government Agreement, as might very well happen if it is communicated to the Sheikh, they might be able to use it to advance their claims to the concession. Furthermore we do not want the terms of this agreement made more public than can be helped. At the same time we feel that the negotiators must have the utmost possible freedom in dealing v/ith the Sheikh, and if they anticipate trouble at a later date if the agreement is v/ithheld from him now we concur that it would be unwise to v/ithhold it. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner and Starling. Yours sincerely. J.C.Walton, Esa.. C.B.,I.C., indiA omfii, S.I.l. 1 . 0908 / 34 .

P.Z.1400/34. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 1st March 1934 dear MeClaughry, Would you please reTer to Dickson's telegram of 27th February, unnumbered, of which copies have already been sent to you unaer our printed letter, number as above, on the subject of landing grounds in Kovveit? Itj is very satisfactory that no difficulty should arise about landing grounds (b) and (c), and, subject to your views, we are of opinion that it would be desirable at once to take advantage of the Sheikh's offer to loan them indefinitely to Government without rent subject to the proviso mentioned. 3 ‘ it is &gt; °i course, for the Air Ministry to say how much importance they attach to securing area (a), but £rima faerie there would seem, if your financial authorities agree, to oe much to be said for taking up at once with the the Sheikh the question of what rent he would demand in respect/ Wing Commander w.A. McClaughry, ^ D.S.O., M,C,, D.F.C., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2.—respect of it. If we do not take advantage of the offer which has now been rnaae to us it seems highly prohahle that, in view of the value of the area to the Oil Company, cts stated in 'thirdly' of Dickson's telegram, they will he anxious to secure it for their own purposes and it woulu probably he difficult for us to refuse to allow them to make use of it if we haa on our siae failed to take aavantage of the offer now reported to have been made by the Sheikh* Would you be so kind as to let me know what your view is about this and what action you woulu like us to take? 4o A s regards the last paragraph of Dickson’s telegram, it is in our view unnecessary to insert any special reference to these landing grounas in the Political Agreement, the terms of Clause 8 of which in its present form will cover all the areas in question if we decide to come to an arrangement with the Sheikh in respect of them. 5o 1 am senaing copies of this letter to Pendel at th^ loreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department.

Letters have now been received from the other three Depts. (the Petroleum Dept., Admiralty and F.O.) officially concurring in the terms, and m the procedure in regard to signature. The F.O. make a drafting suggestion in regard to Art. 4 of the agreement. I have ascertained that the Coy. are prepared to agree to the F.O. suggestion, and this article in the agreement will be modified accordingly. We are still awaiting the concurrence of the G. of I. and the Pol. Resident in the latest modifications in the agreement. When these are received and/and the agreement is ready for execution, it is suggested that it should be signed by Sir L. Kershaw. The Coy. have made a last-moment suggestion for an addition to Art. 12 of the agreement, on which we are consulting the other authorities concerned. If they agree with our view that the Coy.’s suggestion may be accepted, and if we hear in time from the Pol.

My dear Walton, Many thanks for copy of draft Agreement forwarded under cover of your letter of the 24th February, P.Z.1047/34. Mr.Stevens called here yesterday and we discussed the two points dealt with in your letter. (2) With respect to the proposed Sub-Clause (d) in Article 11(a), we agree with the Clause provided also the following addition be made to the Arbitration Clause 12:- As explained by telephone, the addition to Article 11(a) Clause (d), if unqualified elsewhere, would involve the Company in the cancellation of its Agreement even should it be in default with respect to a relatively minor matter. (3) As regards the suggested new Clause in the Commercial Agreement, we would like to suggest that it be slightly modified, as follows 'It is hereby declared that should any of the terms of this Agreement be inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of fei Agreement between the Company and H.K.Gr. signed* in London on this Agreement shall, to the extent of any such inconsistency or conflict, be subordinate to and controlled by the terms of that Agreement between the Company and H.M. Gr. ' 'and any such notice of termination shall not be effective unless the Company shall have failed to remedy a failure on its part to observe the terms of this Agreement within a reasonable period of time fixed by the arbi trators for so doing.'2 . (4) We have suspended instructing our representatives at Kuwait with respect to the additions! A under discussion pending receipt of your concurrence in the modifications we suggest. When, however, we telegraph them informing them of the modifications agreed upon, we should like to instruct them as follows are telegraphing particulars of G-overn- ment Agreement to the Political Resident, and Political Resident or Political Agent will, at such appropriate time as he may determine, bring to the notice of the Sheikh the need for the insertion of these two new Articles. I take it that this line of action will be agreeable to you. We are in hope that, as suggested by you yesterday by telephone, it may prove possible to sign the completed Agreement on Wednesday. w. ) a J • C. - * a 11 o n ksq . , -&gt; • - - * , ^ • &gt; India Office, Whitehall.Iii any furtlier communication on this subject, please quote 1372 no. e 1222/160/91 and address— but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, Foreign Office. s,W.l. 27th February, 1954 London, S.W.l.

I enclose copy of a telegram which has been despatched to Fowie, authorising him to notify to the Sheikh the formal permission of H.M.G. to negotiate with the Koweit Oil Coy. In view of the opinions of Dickson and Fowle given in para. 3(a) of the latter’s telegram of 16th Feby., it appears unnecessary at present to inform the Sheikh m the terms suggested in para. 4 of our telegram of 13th Feby. We hope that the Coy.’s representatives at Koweit and the Political Agent will work in harmony during the negotiations, but if we should be disappointed m this, we can consider again the question of giving more positive backing to the Koweit Oil Coy. As regards para. 3(b) of Fowle’s telegram, could you consider this and. let re know whether the F.O. agree to Fowle giving the Sheikh m writing the information which he suggests m this para.?

W~ ' Fl • Treasury, WHITEHALL, S.W. May 20th, 1914. Gentlemen, With reference to the Financial Agreement which has been duly settled on behalf of His Majesty's Government and sent to your Company for signature, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to offer the following observations regarding the provisions of the amendments proposed to your Articles of Association:- 1 . By the new Article 91 a it is provided that an ex officio Director shall have the right to negative any resolution which may be proposed at a Board or Committee Meeting, but that the other Directors or a majority of them, shall haye^ the right to appeal therefrom to His Majesty's Government, which, for tne purpose of the Article, is defined as meaning the Treasury and the'Admiralty. His Majesty's Government are of opinion that it would not be* prudent, or, indeed, practicable, to qualify the generality of the right of veto. On the other hand, is felt that'the ordinary Directors (meaning by that expression the Directors(other than the ex officio Directors), and incidently the members of the Company, should have some safe guard in the matter. It is thought that the right which is o be given the new Article to the ordinary Directors of appeal ing to the two Departments wi}.l afford the requisite safeguard. The ordinary Directors wiftl, besppealing to the Departments, be in a position to ensure in regard to any particular question that the right of veto is not exercised until the question has been considered and adjudicated upon by the Departments.I am to add that His Majesty 1 s Government do not propose to make use of the right of veto except in regard to matters of general policy, such as - (1) The supervision of the activities of the Company as they may affect questions of foreign naval or military policy; (2) Any proposed sale of the Company 1 s undertaking or proposed change of the Company*s status; (5) The control of new exploitation, sites of wells, etc. (4) Sales of crude or fuel oil to foreigners, or such exceptional sales to other persons on long contracts as might endanger the due fulfilment of current Atlmiralty contracts; and that their interference (if any) in the ordinary admini stration of the Company as a commercial concern will he strictly limited to the minimum necessary to secure these objects. Further, in the case of any such interference, due regard will be paid to the financial interests of the Company in which, under the proposed arrangement, the Government have themselves so large a stake. While His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to enter into any binding agreement in regard to the exercise of the veto, you are at liberty to treat the above as an assurance as to the general lines upon which they will act in the matter, not only in regard to the Anglo-Persian Company (Limited), but also in regard to the subsidiary Companies.2. By the words added to Article 96 it is provided that the ex officio Directors shall be members of every Committee of the Board. His Majesty 1 s Government do not, however, contem plate that both the ex officio Directors should always be present at Committee meetings. Occasions may arise when it may be desirable that both the ex officio Directors should be present, but as a general rule the presence of only one of these would be necessary. Indeed, at some meetings it may not be necessary that either of them should be present. 5 .

They were reassured on this point. clause in the Government Agreement providing that the English Courts should have jurisdiction to determine all disputes any dispute could arise under the agreement which could he brought before any Court of Law and the meeting was inclined to think that a clause of the kind suggested was unnecessary. This point was left for further examination by the India Office. The necessity for a clause in the Commercial Agreement to provide that that agreement should not take effect until the conclusion of the Government Agreement and should be subject to the terms of the latter was also left for further examination. Aj • it should oe made clear that the selection of sites for The India Office Legal Advisers had suggested a relating to the agreement. Sir Louis Kershaw doubted whether The Company's representatives agreed that it was for His/ 4His Majesty's Government to determine to what extent the Sheikh should be informed of the terms of the Government Agreement and also to determine the time and manner of so informing him.■MM13th February 1934.

The agreement is most satisfactory. Personal to Walton onlVo Best Congratu lations \on victory to you and L^ithwaiteExtract from letter from Mr. Elkington of the Auglo-Fersisn Oil Company to Mr. Hearn. Many thanks; for your letter HE/46 of 19th January, enclosing a copy of the Qatar map as sent hy you to the India Office. It is similar to the map sent by us to the F.E. and we too pointed out the reason for the divergencies between it and the War Office map. Tour letter also clears up the point referred to in the fourth paragraph of my letter EH/95 of 23rd January. Your policy of looking to H.M.Ck for support in Kuwait as well as Qatar is in accordance with a feeling which I have already expressed in this correspondence, namely that it would be unwise to discount altogether the possibility that the Shaikh of Kuwait may not receive the Kuwait Oil Company with open arms. He may yet bring in the S.O. of California, or others, as competitive bidders, whether through greed or desire to remain en rapport with Ibn oaud, eiiiher through genuine subservience to the latter, or in order to play him profitably off against H While we hope that the Kuwait Oil Company f s passage will be smooth, I feel that it is better to be forearmed as far as possible against all eventualities. The activity of the Standard Oil Company of California in Bahrein, whether spurious or not, will increase their prestige along the Arab coast, where get-rich-quick methods have not yet yielded to sounder economies. ‘The continued presence in Kuwait of Abdul Latif ibn Abdul Jalil may also indicate that the Saudi viewpoint is being kept prominently before the bhaikh. Our own knowledge of Abdul Latif, expanded by that contained in^ Medlicott f s letter Bo.S/lE/iOO of 23rd October last, makes it unlikely that he is in Kuwait for nothing. Ana with Philby and Ydlibi still in the field and the desert telephone in its usual active operation the Shaikh will oe aware that- 2 - the Kuwait Oil Company is not the only suitor for his hand, and may yet feel inclined to mix politics with business unless it is clearly indicated to him that such a course is unhealthy. My opinion is that the next step, both in Kuwait and Qatar, should be taken by H.M.C. In both these States the rulers have openly professed their desire to have their territories tested for oil and, if the test is successful, exploited on a concession basis. After prolonged negotiations the one outstanding question is the cash, and in each case the cash terras have been brought up to figures which, I presume, no unbiassed person would deny to be satisfactory. let both rulers, who have so long depended for their existence on M*M*0r. may no?/ contemplate extorting uncommercially high terms by taking advantage of a confused political situation. Ostensible justification for such action may be attempted by reference to H.M.GJs action in Kuwait (which is taken as a precedent elsewhere) in stating that they have no preference for British over other foreign firms as concessionaires, this being a volte-face from the previous expressed or implied obligation on British protected rulers to favour British interests or be prepared to iorego British protection. It see is therefore as if B.M.Gr. should now make it clear to these rulers, for the benefit of all concerned, both where they stand and where their interests lie. t.nd fortunately this can be done without giving offence in susceptible quarters by reason of the international constitution of the I.P.O. and the Anglo-American co-operation arranged by us in the only territory where the I.P.C. writ does not run. I suggest that, before our negotiators return to Kuwait or Qatar, the Political Resident, in his capacity as xhe Shaikh’s guardian and guide, should clearly indicate to them V»nw /- 3 - how the position stands. He should tell the shaikh of Qatar, for instance, that the a.P.0.0, in these negotiations represents the strongest international group in the world, who are best fitted to exploit his territory; that the terms now offered are generous; that H.I.Gr. will guarantee full protection to Qatar territory if the A.P.O.G. are exploiting it under a concession; and that H.M.Cr. will not approve proposals from other quarters for a ^atar Oil Concession, as they believe that no other Company is as fit to exploit it as the A.P.O.G. (or I.P.C.) The same points, substituting the Kuwait Oil Company for the A.P.O.G., should be put to the Shaikh of Kuwait. Unless the political cards can be placed on the table beforehand in some such fashion as this I feel that, certainly in Qatar and possibly in Kuwait, the Shaikhs, through uncertainty as to H.M.Gr.’s position, will attempt to exploit it. Our negotiators certainty ought to be able to leave politics out of their calculations, and this will be impossible unless the political authorities put the case plainly to the Shaikhs. My opinion of course presupposes that H.M.Gr. are now anxious to re-establish their position on the Arab coast, and will consequently make an effort to clarify the situation now that the supposed dangers of plain speaking have been cleared away by our Anglo-American entente. Many thanks for your letter Ha/ 4? of 461h January, which has just arrived. It shows how refreshingly keen an interest H.M.Gr. are taking in our negotiations, and I hope- they will be the more ready to take a line such as I have \ described above.[IS DOCUMENT IS TK2 FHOPERTY OP HIS ERITAim'HIC MAJESTY'S GOVERMENT. ) EGR ET, Q, C, .1503.

The following conclusions were reached in regard to amendments suggested by His Majesty’s Government in the draft* Koweit Commercial Agreement (cf. Mr. Walton’s letter of 30th January to Mr. Fraser, No.P.Z.723/34). Preamble and throu^nout . The Company agreed to substitute ’’Sheikh” for ’’Government”. Article 4 . The Company agreed to add at the end of the first sentence the words ’’and a report of its Wok operations under this agreement during year” and at the end of the last sentence the words ’’with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish”. Article 5 (A) . The Company agreed to add after line 12 ’’The inhabitants of the state of Koweit are not prevented from taking their usual requirements of these materials, and that”. It was agreed that the clause providing that the use of transport by air by the Company should be ”subject always to any general regulations for aircraft made by the Sheikh” should be transferred to the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. Article 5 (B) /—£—iS) • 1'^ was agreed that the clause providing uiiat the Sheikh should be the sole judge whether a national emergency existed should be transferred to the G o vernment agr e eme nt. Article__6 (B) In view of the fact that the article uould be dualiried 'by Clause 4 of the Govemment agreement the Government representatives agreed to this aiticle with the addition at the end of the words n to the oheikh”. It was agreed that a sentence should be added in Clause 4 of the Government agreement to the effect that tue airangemeu g contemplated in the second sentence of the Clause would not prevent the Sheikh's representative from dealing direct with the Company on minor routine matters. Article 7. The Government representatives agreed not to press for the re-insertion in line 10 of the words 'food supplies'. Some discussion took place on the question vale the r something should be paid by the Company for exemption from taxation before the time when commercial production was declared, but it was agreed that no payment need be made by the Company under this head on the understanding that the value of the exemption was taken into account in fixing the amount of the dead rent in Article 3 (b). The Company’s representatives explained that they proposed to offer the Sheikh 65 thousand rupees per annum (Article 3 (b)) before and 800 thousand rupees per annum after (Article 3 (e)) commercial production was declared. A rticle 9 . The Company agreed: (a) to insert 'with the consent of' before 'on conditions to be arranged'. (b)/lease o Cb) to substitute 'the terms of such purchase or lease shall not be' for the words 'at rates not'. (c) and to add at the end of the article:~ 'The Company shall acquire only such land, houses and buildings as are .necessary for its operations under this agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh from time to time of the land, houses and buildings which it requires to occupy for its operations, and land, houses and building* previously acquired by the Company from the Sheikh but found no longer necessary for its operations shall be returned by the Company to the Sheikh at a price not greater than the price previously paid by the Company for them'. A rticle 11 (c) The Company agreed to substitute for this clause the words 'If the Company shall be in default under the arbitration provisions of Article 18'. A rticle 12 (B ) The Company agreed to substitute at the end of (a) after 'free of cost' and before 'but' the sentence 'Producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in reasonably good order and repair', and to substitute the same sentence in (b) for the words 'in such working condition as the property then is'. Article 15 . The Company agreed to the same alteration here as in Article IE (B) (oj. The Company! lagreed that before the signature of the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh a clause should oe added either in the Commercial Agreement or in the Government Agreement, or possibly in both, providing that the Comrneicial Agreement/Agreement should not take effect until the Government Agreement had been concluded and that the terms of the Commercial Agreement should be subject to the terms of the Government Agreement. It was decided that meanwhile His Majesty’s Government should seek legal advice as to the agreement in which this clause should appear and whether the Sheikh would have legal grounds for objecting to the Commercial Agreement if it were in some manner qualified by a Government Agreement of which he did not know the terms. The Company agreed that the Political Agent would be kept in close touch with their negotiations with the Sheikh and immediately informed of the result of all meetings and of all developinents including any alteration in the financial terms offered. II. The following are the conclusions of the meeting as regards the agreement between His and the Koweit Oil Company. Majesty's Government q # qxt Louis Kershaw said that he would agree to the substitution of 'British Empire' for 'United Kingdom' m this clause subject to agreement on clause 3. 2. This clause was agreed. 3. No agreement was reached on paragraph 1. Paragraph 2 was agreed. 4 t sir Louis Kershaw said he would agree to omit 'British' before 'local employees' subject to agreement on article 3. 5. It was agreed to add the words 'subject to the terms of the concession' at the Beginning o+ thi- cl-u^c. 6. It was pointed out to the Company's representatives that/0. that the Air Ministry had raised objection to the substitution in line 5 of the words T, have been preYiously selected” for the words 'be required”. Mr. Fraser and Mr. Stevens strongly represented the difficult position in which the Company might be placed if this alteration were not made, since, under the article in its present form, they might be called upon by His Majesty's Government to vacate an area on which they had already commenced operations. It was agreed that the matter should be further considered with the Air Ministry. Subject to the concurrence of the Admiralty it was agreed to add after 'harbours” in line 11 ”as may be developed by the Sheikh or His Majesty's Government” and to add at the end of the clause the sentence 'Harbours developed by the Company shall be for its exclusive use”. ?. The following redraft of this clause was agreed subject to a reference to the Communications oub-’oommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence:- 'telegraph, wireless and telephone installations, if any, maintained by the Company shall be foi use only in its business and as provided in the concession, and Ahall be so constructed and operated that theii opeiatiom-j shall not interfere with the operations of such wireless, telegraph or telephone installations as may be established oy the Sheikh or His Majesty's Government'. 8. The fo11owing redraft was agre e d:- 'The Company declare that it is their inben bier , should they consider that commercial conditions justny it, r .y-Yv’-’-fni t If and when the Company is to erect a rennery at Howeit. xr ana satisfied/satisfied that comaercial production is assured, the Company agrees to examine with His Majesty 1 s Government, the question of establishing a refinery in Koweit of suitable type and capacity'. This clause was agreedI (1) The addition after 'Company' in the 5th line of the words 11 to the extent of any refining capacity it may have in Koweit” was agreed. (2) The addition after 'increase' in the second line of the words 'so far as reasonably possible with existing facilities' was agreed. {o) It was agreed to substitute 'reasonable' for 'possible' in line 1, and that the last sentence of the clause should be redrafted so as to provide that the point regarding the cause of any delay should be subject to mutual agreement and arbitration in the same way as the question of price in clause 4. (4) First paragraph . It was agreed to delete in line 5 the words 'prior to the exercise of the right of pre-emption' and to substitute in line 6 the words 'a fair price' for 'the fair market price'. Second paragraph . This was agreed. (5) It was agreed to add in line 2 after 'premises of the Company' the words 'in Koweit and in such event' the Coiirpany shall etc t\ft Subject to the provisions of this paragraph the employees of the Company in Kuwait shall so far as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. The maximum number of employees of other nationalities shall at all times be subject to the approval of H.M.Gr. With a view to determining such maximum (exclusive of foreign labor) from time to time will consult with the Company and it will be the purpose of H.M. G. to meet the wishes of the Company in so far asthis can be done with due regard to the interests of H.M. G. Until otherwise determined in accordance with the foregoing the number of employees of other nationalities (exclusive of foreign labor) shall not exceed twenty-five. fhe-Gompany i mme d i atelv to discontinue the employments in Kawcrtt whasa employment by the Company H.M.

Walton, It was agreed that article 3 should he so re dratted as to make the point taken in its last paragraph subject to agreement or arbitration in the same manner as is provided in Article 4 in respect of price. It will, I think, be simplest to omit the words ‘‘H.M.G. shall be satisfied that* in the last sentence of the clause as it stands and to add after that sentence the sentence shown in the fair copy of the pre-emption Clause now attached, beginning “Any dispute and ending *in force”. 2. It might be possible, if this redraft is adopted, to shorten the first paragraph of clause (4). But no great harm would be done if it were left to stand as it is.

INDL4. OFFICE, MIT2HALL, 3.W. 1. 5th February 1934. My hear Me Glaughry, Many thcinas ior your letter of trie 29th January, ioO. S.31084/part 2 , about air facilities in Kovveit. We note the views expressed by the Air Officer Commanding. . Permission for the free use of the existing land- in.g ground will presumably be covered by the arrangements which the Political .Resident has been instructed to endeavour to make with the sheikh of Koweit in regard to civil end military aerodromes in his territory. 3. As regards additional facilities to meet possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we should, so far as possible, have selected any ' areas we may wish for defence etc. purposes in advance, and while the suggestion made by you in connection with the Qatar facilities, that the phrase 'any sites which m ^ may/ Wmg Commander W.A. McClaughry, D 8 Q., MG., DFC., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway,A may have heen 8electe!i ,, in Clause 5 ox the Government Agreement should he strengthened, e.g. on the lines ,,5 any sites which may he required', was discussed with them a few days ago, they took the line that the revised wording woula place them in an impossible position. Unless, therefore, the Air Ministry see strong objection, we think it would he desirable to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Conmanding’s opinion, he required near Jhaira and Suhaihiya. Once the sites have heen selected the desirability of acquiring them ana also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding* s telegram of 26th January, as an insurance against the future, could he considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably he desirable not to let it become generally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Commanding are not Government land the effect may be to put up the price against us. 4. The position in regard to the points dealt with in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply is generally similar to that in regard to Qatar. An assurance has been/G - Dsen obtained from the Company as regards wireless and other methods of communication; difficulty should not presumably arise as regards the point referred to in (b); point (c) is orm ±or cousiueration 9 as is point (d); point (e) is a matter for local discussion and agreemen of financial terms once any new landing grounds have been acquired; (f) is equally for local discussion in the first place, as is (h); the position in regard to (g) is as stated in respect of Qatar in paragraph 5 of my letter No. p.Z.727/34 of 1st February. 5. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department.

We shall he pleased to attend the meet ing on Friday at 11.0 in Sir L. Kershaw^s room, when, as you suggest, we might also discuss the outstanding points in the Qatar Commercial” Agreement. Yours sincerely. J* C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, WHITEHALL, S.W.l.imiA OFFICE 30til J anuary , 1934 ' JL&lt;b/ Tie have now completed our examination, in consultation with Mr. Starling, of the draft of the commercial agreement concerning the Kowe it concession. We have the following suggestions to make. Preamhle and throughout : - Substitute 'Sheikh' for 'Government'. Article 2 :- Add new sub-clause (C): 'The Company shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under this agreement.' Article 4 :- Add at the end of the last sentence 'with the exception of such figures therein as he rnay be required by law to publish'. Article 5 (A ):- Add after line IS 'the inhabitants of the State of K owe it are not prevented from talcing their usual requirements of these materials, and that'. Add at the end of 5 (A) (as a qualification of transportation/ r, Esq., C.B.E., y Chairman, iglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.tid,nspoitaticn by air coMQ.unica'tion or opera'tion) 'blie vvords 'subject always to any general regulations for aircraft made by the Sheikh'. Article 5 (13) : - Add after 'national emergency' '(as to which the Sheikh shall be the sole judge)'. We doubt the necessity of Article 6 (B). No doubt in practice the Sheikh will appoint somebody to deal with the local representatives of the Company in regard to matters of a more or less routine character such as looking after the supply of information which the Company will render to the Sheikh, and if necessary checking measurements and statements of oil sold or exported on which royalty is payable. The provision in the Government Agreement that the Company’s local relations with the Koweit authorities shall always be conducted through the Political Agent will not, of course, be interpreted as precluding direct dealings between the representatives of the Sheikh and the Company on such matters as the above. Article 7 :- We would like to reinsert in line 10 the words 'food supplies' before the words 'personal goods'. Three/Three lines from the end, after the word 'shall' before 'pay' insert 'in addition to the payments provided for in Article 3'. End of Article 9 :- (a) Insert 'with the consent of' before 'on conditions to be arranged'; (b) substitute 'the terms of such purchase or lease shall not be' for the words 'at rates not'; (c) add sentences such as appear in Article 7 of the Qatr draft, viz .; 'The Company shall acquire only such land houses and buildings as are necessary for its operations under this Agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh from time to time of the land houses and buildings which it requires to occupy for its operations, and land houses and buildings previously acquired by the Company from the Sheikh but found no longer necessary for its operations shall be returned by the Company to the Sheikh free of cost.' Article 11 (c) :- Substitute 'If the Company shall be in default under the arbitration provisions of Article 18.' Article 12 (B) (a) Add 'Producing wells or borings/borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working.” Lb) &gt;- Substitute for ”such working condition as the property then is” the words T, good order and repair and fit for further working”. s Article 15; - Substitute for 'such working condition as the property then is' 'good order and repair and fit for further working 11 ♦ It will be necessary to add at some stage before the agreement is concluded a clause to provide that it shall not come into force until the parallel Company- Government Agreement is concluded, and that its provisions shall be read as subject to the provisions of the latter agreement. As regards Article 3, the financial terms to be finally included will of course depend on the course of the negotiations with the Sheikh. But we understand that, as the Political Agent is to be kept in close touch with the negotiations and to be immediately informed of all developments, he will be informedof the proposals first made by the Company regarding the xinancial terms, and of subsequent developments in the negotiations regarding them. Could we have a meeting on Friday, 2nd February, at 11 o 1 clock in Sir 1, ICershav^s room here to discuss the suggestions made above? Mr, Starling could come at that time. We could perhaps discuss the outstanding points in the Q,atr Commercial Agreement at the same meeting. Youi's sincerely. (S4.) J. C, WALTON.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 30th January, 1934. (E 610/160/91) My dear Walton, Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of the 25th January to Seal about refining and pre-emption in connexion with the proposed Koweit concession. 2. As you have kindly done so, I am asked to let you know that so far as the Foreign Office are concerned, we feel that it would be a thousand pities if negotiations with the Company were allowed to break down on either of these points. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal and Starling. J *C. Walton Esq., C.B., M.C.m jv snaw , \ ‘ Sir L . Kersb The letter I sent to Mr. Seal yesterday is attached. He telephones that he and Mr. Starling will get together with Mr. Fraser to explore possibilities. (He himself has the idea of the Admiralty offering to purchase part of the refined oil as a possible compromise.) Mr. Seal says that the official letter from the Admiralty of 24th Jany., now received, does not require an answer at present, but was intended merely to nut their official point of view on record. I pointed out to him that the decision of 1930 applied only to concessions m British territory, and that quite different considerations arise (as has always been recognised) in regard to the independent Arab Sheikhdoms under our protection in the Persian C-ulf. 'JujAny further communication uld be addressed to:— » Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W. i. quoting ‘3./..S.4... Sir, With reference to your letters P.Z.101/34 of the 4th January and P.Z.145/34 of the 6th January, 1934, concerning oil at Koweit, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer the following observations for the Secretary of State for India in Council. E. In 1930, when it was decided that foreign controlled companies should in future be permitted to operate in British territory, it was laid down that at least 50$ of the oil obtained should be refined on British territory; that the plant should be capable of producing fuel oil suitable for Admiralty use; and that the Government should retain the right of pre-emption in case of emergency. My Lords consider that the policy of H.M. Government should be to insist upon these stipula tions as the minimum, and to point out to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company that these are requirements which would have to be met by any company of whatever nationality operating in Koweit. It is also very important that the refinery should be not merely in British territory, but either in Moweit itself (which is for all practical purposes the same thing) or at some port east of Koweit, e.g* Karachi or some other Indian port. /If ie Under Secretary of State, India Office, S. 1. 1. OOP/ siyvT sv A |R MAtL M l3. If H.M. Government give way in Koweit it will be impossible to stand out for these safeguards in Qatar, where the circumstances are almost identical. The concession at Bahrein has been given away without safe guards of any real value, and unless H.M. Government insist upon them in Koweit and Qatar it will mean that all the oil which has hitherto been found on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf has passed to partly foreign (or at best international) interests without any reservation which would enable us to avoid dispute in using the oil in war as an adjunct to the main supply in Persia. 4.

C .Hearn' ) Sir Louis Kershaw said he understood that the Company’s representatives had already had a list of suggested points for inclusion in an agreement and asked what the Company’s general reactions were to these suggestions. Mr♦Stevens and M r♦Eraser agreed that tne paper c onmun i c at e d to them would serve as a satisfactory basis for discussion, but said that there were certain clauses of considerable difficulty which would have to be considered. Mr.Fraser emphasised that the Company had to look at the matter f r cm a purely commercial point of view. Sir Louis Kershaw reminded him of the point ox \iew of H.M.G-. who would have to undertake considerable responsibilities if a concession were granted to the Company He emphasised that His Majesty’s Government in Koweit.had to consider this question from a political rather than a commercial point of view. It was agreed that the various clauses should he considered hy the meeting one hy one. CLAUSE 1. Mr . Stevens suggested that the clause might he widened to admit of any transferee or subsidiary company being registered in any part of the British Empire, This might get over certain difficulties in connection with taxation in the United Kingdom. Asked whether he had any other advantages in mind in making the suggestion, he said that no other specific advantage had occurred to him and he agreed that the forming of a subsidiary was not contemplated at present. Mr.Eraser said, that United Kingdom taxation was a severe obstacle to Companies which included foreign interests having their headquarters in this country, and alluded to the case of the building of the I.P.C. pipe line, where the Company undertaking that operation had to be made Canadian, so that American, Butch and French interests should be free from United Kingdom income tax. Sir Louis Kershaw said that he saw the point of Mr.Stevens' suggestion and that H.M.G. would consider it sympathetically in the case of transferee and subsidiary canpanies. CLAUSS 2. The Company's representatives agreed to this clause. They also agreed that provision might he included in the agreement to guard against thethe Koweit Oil possibility of the 50/50 basis of the Koweit Oil Company itself being altered. CLaU'SE 5, first paragraph . Mr. Fraser said that the Company would like some modification of this clause, and Mr. Stevens suggested that the 50/50 basis of Clause 2 might be introduced also in Clause 3, to allow of the employment of drillers, geologists, etc. of American or other foreign nationality, and that employees other than the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s subjects might be 50‘p British and 50)1 foreign. Sir Louis Kershaw said that the limitation on the employment of foreigners was suggested purely for political reasons, since if, for example, any employee of the Company 'were murdered or got into any other kind of trouble in Koweit, it would be easier for Mis Majesty’s Government to deal with the case if trie Company’s employees were British. If, for example, the employee were an American citizen, tnere might be diplomatic difficulties with the American Government. Sir Louis Kershaw pointed out that even in L nine in the Standard Oil Company ox California nad accepted a provision that as far as possible only British personnel should be employed and that in Koweit, with its tiibol hinterland the situation was much more dixficulr mm in an island such as Bahrein. His Majesty’s Government were, however,quite willing to allow the employment of foreigners if necessary in exceptional cases. Hr. Fraser suggested that the Company should be allowed to judge whether it was necessaiy in anf ca^e to employ foreign personnel. Hie Company should be ableto call on the services of the best men, whatever their nationality. He suggested the following redraft of the clause: - '‘The employees of the Company in Koweit shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit, provided that with the consent of His Majesty 1 s Government such persons of other nationality as are in the judgment (or tpinion ) . .of the ^Company required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking may be employed.” The consent of His Majesty^ Government would still be necessary to the employment of any foreigner and they would, in the last resort, have the last word. Mr.» -Stevens said he saw no objection if the interposition of His Majesty's Government were directed against the unsuitability of any particular person, otherwise than on grounds of nationality, but he remained of opinion that, subject to this proviso, the Company should be able to employ non-British personnel of any nationality up to 50y. Sir Louis Kershaw said that the employment of foreign personnel should be subject to the general proposition that if suitable British subjects were available these should always be employed, but Hr. Stevens thought that the Company should be able to employ other nationalities even if suitable British personnel were available. The possibility was considered of limiting the 50/50 arrangement proposed by Mr. Stevens to the technical and directing staff of the Company, but bothSir Louis Kershaw and lir . Fraser preferred to avoid any liar a and xast ^e i ceiiuac^e arrange iiie n t bir nouis jxersliaw suggested tile following redraft:- 'file Company undertakes that so far as is consistent with the successful carrying out of the undertaking their employees shall he British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Itoweit. His Majesty's Government may object to any employee and in the case of such objection being taken such employee shall not be employed”. fhe Company's representatives entirely agreed that Eis Majesty's Government should be able to object in any specific case to the employment of any person whom they regarded as unsuitable and Mr. Fraser recognised the reasons for His Majesty's Government's anxiety that the Company's personnel should be mainly British, in view of political complications, but Mr. Stevens still objected to the general proposition that British personnel should be employed save by way of exception. The Bahrein agreement was again referred to. Mr. Staid in g and Mr« Laiuhwaite sal a mat trie Bahrain clause had not been entirely satisfactory in practice. In suite of the undertaking they had given the Banrein Company nad at first employed almost entirely non-British technical staff though they had recently agreed to increase the Biitioii proportion* Mr. Walton saiu tnat a ratnei otrouper safeguard was required in Koweit where the risks were quite different. It was not reasonable to limit personnel ciitixely toto. British subjects but any increase of non-British employees would increase at the same time the political risk and a 50^ non- British element might be much too large. His Majesty’s Government were not concerned with the nationality from the point of view of the working of the Company, but purely from the political standpoint. It was necessary to satisfy the Company’s desire for efficient working but at the same time to reduce political risks to a minimum and the latter desideratum involved the limitation of foreign t&amp;rsormel. Mr. Fraser said that for the efficient working of :r* the Company might conceivably be necessary to bring in even 755*3 of foreign personnel and he preferred the redrait of clause 3 which he had already suggested, but Mr. Stevens still objected to basing the employment of foreign personnel upon the necessity of efficient working. He would agree, however, to the clause in the Bahrein agreement with a modification to provide that the Company should oe allowed uo be the sole judge from the commercial point of view of the necessity for employing foreign personnel, suoject. Ox coui^e to H.M.G.’s overriding power to object in any specific case on personal grounds, but not on grounds of nationality. Ho agreement was reached, Mr. Fraser’s proposed redraft being the most promising solution suggested. It was agreed that the matter should be further considered. CLAUSE 3. second -paragraph This was agreed in principle.CL/LUSS 4 7. % l/Lr, Stevens agreed that the designation of the Chief Local Representative should be subject to the approval of but he objected to the proviso that he should necessarily be of British nationality, and Mr. Fraser ashed whether there would be any objection to appointing an American if he happened to be the most suitable man. Sir Louis hershaw said that he would see no objection to missing out the word 'British' in the first line of the clause if the Company satisfied His Majesty’s Government’s desiderata in respect of Clause 3, and it was agreed that this point might be left over for consideration along with clause 3. Ch,USE 5 . The following rearaft suggested by Sir Louis Kershaw to meet the views of the Company’s representatives was agreed:- 'The Company undertake at all times to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Agent and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and subject to the terms of the concession to the wishes of the SheiMi of ICoweit'. CJMUSS 6 . Sir Louis Kershaw agreed to the substitution of the words 'may have been selected' for 'may be required' after the words 'any sites which' in line 5 to meet the wishes of the Company’s representatives. Mr. Laithwaite said his assumption was that the Company would first of all select certain areas for their operations and that then, perhaps considerably later, further areas might be selected and that H.M.G. would have8 the right to choose fresh sites for their own purposes before the Company made any such further selection, Mr. Stevens agreed with this interpretation of the clause. ChuUSS 7 . Sir houis iCershar; said that the .object of the clause was twofold, first ro prevent technical wireless interference, and second as a precaution against the possibility of the Company 1 s installations being used for commercial messages not connected with the Company’s operations. His Majesty’s Government had no idea of interfering in an arbitrary way with the Company’s domestic telegraph, wire1ess M r. Stevens and Mr . Fr like the article redrafted to recognised that Government in over-riding. It was agreed t or telephone installations, a ser said that they v/ould make this clear, but they tcrests should of course be o await suggestions from the Company. ClAiJSE 8 . Mr. Fraser said that it was quite impossible for the Company to accept this provision. He admitted that ideally and from the purely economic point of view oil should be refinedx as near as possible to the point of production. Unfortunately the oil trade was not conducted on economic lines in a number of countries but in accordance with certain nationalistic ideas and if these nations decided that, refining should be done in their own territory and placed substantial tariffs on the importation of refined products, the demand would be mainly for crude oil. This was the present tendency in the oil trade and if the tendency developed it would not in the course of a few years be a commercial proposition to refine at Koweit. Sir L. Kershaw said that the clause did not confine the Company to Koweit and suggested that9. the K owe it oil might he refined in India. thw Fraser said this would he all right if they could supply the Indian market, hut in fact the Indian market was protected. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Shell Company had agreed because of indigenous production not to put oil into India unless Indian production failed to meet local requirements. Sir L. Kershaw said that indigenous production could not supply the whole of the Indian market. Mr. Starling suggested that the Company under the suggested clause could also refine oil in Australia or in New Zealand. Mr. Fraser said that the Company might wish to refine in Koweit or in British territory hut that they could not hind themselves to do so. The principle of Clause 8 was so difficult that they could not possibly accept it. Mr. Starling reminded him that the Company Yv T as only asked to refine half their production in Koweit etc. The rest might he exported anywhere in its crude state. He said that local refining had in his view recently saved Trinidad from a serious situation since they were able to market their refined products when the importation of crude oil into the U.S.A. was prohibited, Mr. Stevens enquired the purpose underlying the clause. Mr. Starling explained that the intention was to make refined oil products available in the Brioish Empire as widely as possible especially in view of the small available supplies of Empire oil and agreed that in the last resort it was framed in order to meet a state of emergency. Mr. Stevens said that the^ were being asked to put up a refinery which the commercial situation might in certain circumstances render quite useless and Mr. Fraser added that the Company wanted the greatest possible freedom to take advantage of the market. Sir L. Kershaw asked whether if we could assume thatthe present conditions of the commercial situation v«ould d e permanen t , the G onipany would then see no objection to the Clause, but ihu Fraser said that even under present conditions it might be objectionable. The cost of oil and the cost of refining were small in conipcii ison Vv r i tn the cos c of transport, loading and unloading of the oil and suppose their market were in China x 02 emample, i t was unreasonable to expect them to transport the oil first to India for refining. No agreement was reached and the Clause was left over for further consideration. CLAUSE 9 . The Company’s representatives, subject always to their objection to Clause 8, accepted the principle of the Clause but said that they wished to suggest certain modifications in the terms of Annexure B. In answer to a point raised by Mr. Walton in connexion with the Commercial. Agreement with the Sheikh, Mr. Fraser and Mr, Stevens agreed that the concession did not cover the Koweit Neutral Zone and said this was clear from the map they had made of the area of the concession. The position as a result of the meeting was that general agreement had been reached except on the two clauses dealing with British local personnel and refining. It was agreed that the latter should be further considered in consultation with the Admiralty. It was proposed to have another meeting as soon as possible to settle outstanding points in the Government Agreement and at the same time to consider the Commercial Agreement. The latter was generally satisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government out they11. might have certain amendments to suggest. Mention was made of the necessity of sooner or later adding a clause suspending the operation of the Coromeicial A areement until the Government Agreement was concluded and making the former subject to the latter. Un- India Office hoped to be able to let the Company have the official views on the commercial agreement as soon as possible, so that a meeting might then be held with a view to reaching agreement on ell points oefoie the Company commenced negotiations with the Sheikh which they were now anxious to do at the earliest possible time.

Reference No.:-P.D. My dear Walton, Thank you for your letter of 18th January enclosing drafts of the heads of agreements to he entered into between H.M. Government and the Koweit Oil Company in regard to Koweit and between H»M* Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in regard to Qatar. The drafts you have proposed seem to me to cover the ground at this stage, but I should like to make the following suggestions: A. Koweit . (1) Some reference should, I suggest, be made to the present status of the Company, with the object of stipulating that the British share holding should be maintained at not less than 50 per cent and that in addition we might require that not less than half of the Directors should be British subjects. This Clause might precede the provisions governing the transfer to any other company. (2) Add at the end of the present Clause 1, M or on the Board of which less than half of the Directors are British Subjects 11 . (3) Clause 3: It would seem advisable to amend the latter part of this clause slightly, so that the last . Walton, Esq., a Office, t Charles Street, I.three lines should read w which in so far as they concern matters arising between the Sheikh and the Company shall always be conducted through the political Agent at Koweit'. As I see it there may be a number of matters which the Chief Local representative can settle with local -people without dragging in the Political Resident. (4) Clause 5: The restriction on the use of harbours under Article 5 seems to require a proviso. Under Article 5 of the draft concession, the company has the right to construct and operate harbours, harbour works, wharves and jetties, oil and coaling stations, etc,, and these provisions are necessary to the commercial working of the undertaking. This Clause of our proposed Agreement might leave them without any harbour facilities if the Government and the Sheikh were to select the only likely places for harbours, I suggest that if that were to happen, the company ought to be assured of facilities to use such harbours on reasonable terms. (5) Clause 7: The Company will need to be reasonably sure of an adequate production before starting to build a refinery in Koweit. I would, therefore, suggest that this clause should be somewhat as follows - When the rate of production of oil reaches (say) 100,000 tons per annum, assessed on the basis of an average daily production over a period of six consecutive months, the company should undertake to refine not less than 50 per cent of the oil in Koweit or in British territory as near to Koweit as practicable - the refinery in either case to be capable of producing oil fuel which will comply with the specification set out in annexure ’A*. This is the form appended to the recently revised Trinidad oil regulations. (6) As I see it, the question of pre-emption is to be one entirely between H.M. Government and the Company, which would mean that the Sheikh would have no right of pre-emption in connection with local troubles in which he might be involved. That being so, I think we could say that n In the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of which H.M. Government shall be the sole judge) etc, we could then either provide that pre-empted oil shall bedealt with on terms to he agreed n ^ t ~'r 1 * •-«SinT.S 0 'srLSf 2 a S4; f r ; e ‘ Sea in consultation with the Petroleum Department? ? 8 B.

With reference to Laithvjaite 1 s letter of 9th January, P.2.154/34, you may like to know the present position in regard to the grant of oil concessions in Qatar to the Anglo Persian Oil Company and in Koweit to the Koweit Oil Company (controlled in equal shares by the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the Gulf Company of the United States of America). It has been decided in each case that the commercial side of the xoroposed concessions should be embodied in an agreement between the Company and the Sneikh concerned, which would not come into force until parallel agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Company concerned have been concluded. The safeguards ox .Dxj.ta.sh interests which we require will be embodied in these G ov e rnme nt ag r e erne nt s. The commercial agreements are already in dra^t, and some progress has been made in discussion of them with the Companies. I enclose copy of Article 7 in the draft commercial agreement respecting Qatar, and ox Article 5 in the draft commercial agreement respecting Koweit. Jxtn a view to safeguarding, inter alia, the position in regaid 00 future requirements of air facilities, we contemplate that each Government agreement should contain clauses on the following lines:- ' 5 ./ ing Commander W.A.McClaughry, P.S.O., m• 0., D.P.0., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Mingsway, W.C.2.'5. iSotwitiistanding anytiiiag contained in the agreement between the Company and the Sheikh of Qatar tlle Coa ®any shall not have the right to uso^or^ occupy, and shall not include in the areas selected for tiie purposes of its operations, any sites which may nave been selected by or on behalf of the Sheikh or rlxs Majesty's Government as being required for aerodromes or xor aeroplane or seaplane bases, or in connection vjitn tue development of harbours, or for wireless and tele gr aph 1 n st al 1 at io ns. 6 * Tiie operation of wireless, telegraph and telephone installations, if any, maintained by the Company shall not interfere with the operation of such wireless, telegraph or telephone installations as may be established under arrangements approved by the Sheilm or His Majesty’s Government”. I imagine that the question of possible future air requirements may be more important in Koweit than it d^ m uateu , out, sueject to your views, a clause on the above lines ought sufficiently to safeguard the position. Presumably, however, it will be necessary to select alternative sites for possible future requirements before the Company commences operations. With reference to the last sentence of .Article 5 (Jl) in the Koweit commercial draft agreement, we propose to suggest the addition of a qualifying clause to the following effect: 'Subject to any regulations of general application for aircraft made by the Sheilm', in order to safeguard the position under the aircraft agreement which7,6 are proposing to the Sheikh of Kovseit (see oar letter of 11th August P.3.4434/33 and connected correspondence).

Mr. Rendel of the F.O. has suggested that a general decision should be reached by higher .authority (and possibly by the Cabinet) as to the exact nature oi tne safeguard in regard to local oersonnel to be .i. * required in ohe case of all oil concessions in the Persian Gull granted to any concessionnaire, of whatever nationality. His idea is that, whatever condition under this head we propose to the Anglo-Persian or the new Anglo-American Go. in Koweit, it would not be possible to propose a more stringent condition to a purely American company which might come into the field if the iingio- Persian or the new Gulf Co. drop out of the running. I doubt whether we need at the present sta seek a decision of quite such general and universal application as suggested. There seems no ^reat advantage in deciding definitely in advance that we will be content, vis -a- vis a purely American company, with the exact amount of safeguard that may satisfy us m dealing with the Anglo-Persian (whose subsidiary in Qatr would at any rate be partly British), or with the new company in Koweit, which will be 50% British. If we make certain proposals to British, or partly British, applicants, and they accept them and obtain the concession® then the question of American, competition does not arise; if, on the other hand, the present applicants fail to get the concessions and American competitors come into the field, it does not seem that the latter would have much cause to complain of discrimination if we propose to them a safeguard more stringent than that which/which had been discussed^ in previous discussions with British applicants, since ex liXBSiiiSSi. ne latter v.-ould have failed to obtain the concessions, ' . if a e-enerai dec controversial question is to be sought, consideraole delay may occur before we are in a position to let the Anglo-Persian and the Koweit Oil Co. know the exact terms of our requirement in regard lo local personnel, this will hold up the conclusion of the contemplated agreements between H.M.G. and the Cos., and consequently delay the final conclusion of their agreements with the Sheikhs. On the other hand, in order to expedite the negotiations already started with the Anglo-Persian in regard to Qabr and the Anglo-American group in regard to Koweit, it is desirable as soon as possible to decide what are the minimum terms in regard to this safeguard with which we will be satisfied in the course of the negotiations with the companies. We should, I think, decide to aim at securing the most satisfactory terms that the companies can be got to accept, and in neither case less than the minimum suggested in the attached draft letter.Draft Paper.

INDIA OFFICE COPY SENT BY AIR J*AfL . nf ^ Bir, 13 JAN 1934 1925 5000 G.33 In connection with the questions of granting an oil concession in Qatr to the A.P.O.C., acting on behalf of the I.P.C., and in Koweit to a^company to be equally conurolled by the -fi.P.O.C. and by the Gun Co. of the U.S.A., I am directed by j the S. of S. for I. to state that he has ’ had under consideation one of the conditions to be laid down as a political . . safeguard m the case of either concession, namely, that the local personnel operating the concession should- be either exclusively, or so far as possible, British subiects or subjects of 1 a. KJ %j the Sheikh concerned. I Sir Samuel Hoare attaches the highest degree of importance to this condition for well known reasons, which need not be fully recapitulated. In view of the primitive conditions obtaining: m the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf, the backward state of the administration, and the uncivilised character of the local and neighbouring populations, it is impossible to ignore the risk of unfortunate incidents or disturbances which might result from the introduction of any considerable number (rQi* b~^ir* of American^personnel of the artisan type into Qatr or Koweit. The dangerof incidents would be much greater in the case of than in the case of British personnel, as the former would be less amenable to the advice ano. instructions of the local British authorities, and at the same tune any such incident in which a foreign national suffered might give rise to international complications, as the foreign Power concerned would naturally demand that • | H.M.G. should either take steps to enforce reparation, or permit it to intervene itself on behalf of its nations,!s. 13 The S.of S. therefore considers that 'every endeavour should be made to secure m agreement on the psaM: of any company seeking an oil, concession in the Arab t A- it ^ sheikhdoms / providing the fullest possibl-e safeguard that the circumstances of a particular case may permit^in regard to the nationality of its local personnel. He does not suggest that it is necessary to impose a condition in identical terms in all cases, since circumstances may differ, and in some of the sheikhdoms the safeguard desired is of even more importance than in others. if. It will be remembered that the American- controlled Bahrein Petroleum Co. agreed to a condition that as many of its employees in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of theDepartment. andertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein. This claise does not altogether exclude the employment of American personnel, and in effect it is largely left to the Co. to decide whether the employment of individual Americans is necessary for 'the efficient carrying on 1 of the undertaking', since this is largely a technical point on which it would be difficult to dispute the Co.’s opinion. . r, The S. of S. agrees with the suggestion, which has been made, in inter departmental discussions, that the various 'political safeguards desired in connection with the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikhs of Qatr and Koweit should be embodied in agreements to be concluded between H.M.G. and the companies concerned. He also agrees that it is desirable not to insist on such conditions as the A.P.O.C. and the new Anglo-American Co.^in Qatr and Koweit respectively^would clearly be unable to accept. But the importance of the safeguard in regard to the nationality of local personnel is so great that he suggests, firstly, that we should aim at securing its embodiment in the Qatr and Koweit agreements/agreements to the fullest extent that may be possible, and secondly, that oui minimum requirement should be a clause following that agreed to by the Bahrein as Petroleum Co.^teF^ slightly modified so to provide that as many of the local employees of the Co. as is consistent, in the judgment of the Co., with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at j all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. —— ' i C, Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful or a very early reply to this letter. As the S. of S. for F.A. is aware, the matter is urgent, since agreements between the Companies and the Sheikhs concerned cannot be brought into force - and ought perhaps, not to be finally concluded - pending the conclusion of parallel agreements between the Companies and H.M.G. 7 , Copy of this letter is being sent to the Admiralty and the Petroleum Dept.

However, neither he nor I think that this is likely to occur and you may rest assured that I shall watch this particular aspect of the negotiations with the greatest of care, in order to ensure that difficulties do not arise. Before Major Holmes goes out I shall have a personal talk with him, in which I propose to stress strong ly the necessity for him doing everything to assist, and nothing to compromise, the successful progress of the negotiations.

On receiving the draft which you and he are now going to prepare for an agreement with the sheikh covering the commercial side of the proposed concession, I will communicate it to my colleagues in the other Departments chiefly interested, namely, the Foreign Office, Petroleum Department and Admiralty, ana we will examine it as quickly as possible ana then, I hope, have a meeting with you and hr.

But I will certainly see that Mr. Stevens's suggestion for the insertion after the words 'as is consistent' of the words 'in the judgment of the Company' is most carefully considered, , (b) Ono of the superior British local employees of the Company to be designated, subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government, chief local representative of the Company, and to be responsible for the Company's local relations with the Koweit authorities which should be conducted through the political Agent. (c) provision that the Company and all its local employees will undertake to give due deference at all times to. the wishes of the sheikh and the advice of the political representatives of His Majesty's Government.

(e) some provision in regard to the arbitration of disputes as to the interpretation of the agreement between the Company ana the Sheikh to the effect that, if the arbitrators chosen by each party cannot agree on the selection of a third arbitrator, they will accept a third arbitrator nominated by the political Resident. (f) Trie question of local refining. (g) The question of pre-emption in time of war. An agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government covering these and any similar points (which I have, of course, stated only in the broadest outline) will require very careful examination. If you aid Mr. Stevens can, in conjunction with the India Office, sketch out the rough draft of a document, we can then all examine it in consultation with the other Departments concerned with a view to getting it into shape. We will ao our utmost to expedite consideration of the drafts both of the commercial agreement and of the Government agreement, but, as you understand, the procedure of consultation which I have indicated is necessary, because in a matter of this sort there are so many a if ie rent departments of Government concerned.

Z.233/1934 India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 10th January 1934. Mr. Fraser, of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, brought Mr. Stevens, his collaborator of the Gulf Oil Company, to the India Office on Monday afternoon to introduce him. I was rather favourably impressed by Mr. Stevens, who has a pleasant and straightforward manner. Mr. Fraser put forward the suggestions in regard to procedure and on certain other points which had already been explored in the conversations at the India Office on 3rd and 4th January, and for the most part appeared to carry Mr. Stevens with him. He suggested that there should be two agreements, one between the new Company and the Sheikh covering the commercial questions, and the other between the Company and His Majesty’s Government covering political questions, and that the first should be negotiated by local negotiators, on behalf of the Company, with the 3heii.cn diiect. He agreed that the Political Agent should be kept in close touch with the negotiations, and be immediabely inxoimed of all developments. X agreed that we could concede direct negotiations on this understanding, file Company’s negotiators would be Mr. Chisholm, of the Anglo Pei sian Oil Company, and Major Holmes for the Gulx Company. Mr.eraser at this interview said nothing at all about Major Holmes’s position in the negotiations being in anyway secondary; the whole implication of his remarks was that the two negotiators would be on an equal footing. It seems clear, therexore, tnat vi s-a-visy F'.C.Starling, Esq., Pe t r o leum D e par tine nt, Mi nes be par tine nt, ^ b e an S t an ley t i e e c, S.W.l. c° p I il Y 4 ^vis-a-vis the Gulf Company and in discussions at which theii representative is present, the Anglo Persian Oil Company think it necessary to acknowledge the equal status of the two negotiators. We must presumably accept this ostensible position, in the expectation that it will not affect Mr. Fraser 1 s assurance to us that if Major Holmes gives trouble, he will be able to secure his removal. I enclose copy of a personal letter which I have sent to Mr. Fraser on this point. Mr. Fraser hopes to be able to produce shortly the first draft of the commercial agreement with the Sheikh. When we receive this, we will send you a copy of it, with a view to its early examination, first interdepartmentally and then at a meeting at which Mr. Fraser and Mr. Stevens could be present. After it had been vetted in this way, we would send out copies to the Political Resident and tne Political Agent, and Messrs. Fraser and Stevens would instruct the local negotiators to begin negotiations //i uXx the Sheikh. lie agreed that consideration of the agreement between the Company and trie Government could aloO otait av once. Mr. Fraser will let me have his suggestions, be based on the points indicated in Laithwaite’s letter to Mr. Hearn of 29th December, in regard to the Qatar agreement between the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the Government, so far as these are applicable. 'The question of the nationality of cue loca.1 personnel operating the concession was discussed in an informal way. As vfas anticipated, i.lr. Stevens made considerable difficulty about this. The object of our desideratum that the local personnel should be British or Koweiti/Koweiti was explained to him on the lines suggested in the previous conversations at the India Office, and the relevant clause in the agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company was read to him. It was clear that he had expected that it might be possible to employ a considerable number of Americans, but in the end he gave some indication that he might be prepared to accept a clause on the lines of the Bahrein clause, if the words n as many....... as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking' were further qualified by the words 'in the judgment of the Company'. This is a point which we shall have to consider. Copy is enclosed of a letter which I have sent to Mr. Fraser. I am sending similar letters to Rendel and Seal. (SdJ J. G.

With regard to the suggestion contained in Indi Office letter ’’whether we might not also consider informing him (the Shaikh) that the reply to any oil overtures should he that these must he in the first place submitted throu#i the Political Agent or through His Majesty’s Government”. I doubt whether it would be advisable to go as far as this. The Kuwait Agreement of 1913 (Aitchison, page 264, XLI - Volume XI) merely commits the Shaikh not to give an Oil Concession to anyone except to a person appointed by the British Government, though the Agreemen+ of 1899(Aitchison page 262, XXXVI, Volume Xl) - M not to cede, sell, etc. could also be invoked. The point is that apparently there is nothing in. his Treaties to prevent the Shaikh entering into negotiations with a Company, and merely applying for His Majesty’s Government’s sanction when these negotiations are completed.

INDIA OFPtCt / COPY SENT BY AIR MAR. , r 5 JAN 1934 &lt;£ ! a3 4 NOTE OF INTERVIEW ^ 4^-4 $7 ^ Sir John Cadman and Mr. Fraser called on Sir Loais Kershaw on 4th Jany, primarily in connection with the question raised in Mr. Wakely's letter to Mr. Fraser of 18th Deer. Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite were also present. Sir J. Cadman suggested, and it was agreed on behalf of the I.O., that from the previous discussions regarding the Koweit concession there was sufficient reason for the A.P.O.C. to assume that a 50/50 arrangement with the Gulf Co. would be general-l-y 'approTed by H.M.Gr. It was agreed, however, that this did not mean that H.L.G. were committed in advance to approval of the grant of a concession by the Sheikh of Koweit unless they were satisfied that British interests werej adequately safeguarded - notably in regard to the question of the nationality oi the personnel actually operating the concession. The opportunity was taken to discuss in a nreliminary way certain points which had been mentioned in a previous informal discussion with Mr. eraser on 3rd Jany., .viz., the following:- d)/(i) British local personnel . The A.P.O.C. will do their utmost to get the Gulf Go. to agree to this, and have hope of succeeding if the matter is put to Steffens, their representative in London, in the right way. It could be pointed out that the Bahrein Petroleum Go. have agreed that as many of their employees 'in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects, or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein'. Mr. Fraser thought that the fact that a company under American control has agreed to this condition would carry weight with Mr. Stevens. It could also be explained to the latter that the motive of our desideratum is not -any £ desire to discriminate against Americans, but to ^ safeguard the interests of the undertaking ano. it&lt;s personnel; the peculiar conditions in the Gulf Sheikhdoms necessitate caution m regard to tne admission of Europeans and Americans, and greater caution is necessary in the case of non-British subjects, both because these might not understand so well as British subjects txie desirability of following the advice 01 the political authorities, and also because, if they should get into trouble/trouble with the local or neighbouring populations, the case might involve international complications, instead of being merely a domestic matter %fKthe British Govt* There is no special reason to suppose that the Gulf Coy. will wish to employ Americans; it seems likely that they would prefer that English staff should be employed, as this is cheaper and can be readily provided by the A.P.O.C. Provided no objection is raised by the Gulf Coy. to an arrangement on the lines of the clause in the agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Coy., a clause of this character could be inserted in an agreement to be made between H.M.G. and the Koweit Oil Coy., for it will probably be desirable to adopt in the case of Koweit the same procedure as in the case of ^atr - i.e., to have two agreements, one, covering commercial matters, between the Coy. and the Sheikh, and a second one, covering political questions, between the Coy. and H.M.G. (ii)7L tpestions of local refimnK and, .of preemption in time of war were left over for discussion with the Admiralty. (in) The question of the.method of negotiating the concession with the Sheikh of Kuweit . It wasagreed that the/the commercial side of the negotiations might be conducted by the representatives of the A.P.O.C. and the Gulf Coy. with the Sheikh direct, provided that the Political Agent was and; immediately informed of all develop ments. There will be parallel consultation between Mr. Fraser and H.M.G. at this end. One argument in favour of direct negotiation with the Sheikh on commercial questions is that the negotiations by the two companies while they were competitors were in fact conducted with the Sheikh direct, and if the Sheikh finds that they are suddenly switched into the channel of the Political Agent now that the two companies are combined (and he may consequently have perhaps to put up with less attractive financial I terms), he may attribute the less attractive nature of the offers which are no?/ received to the intervention of the Political Agent. As regards political questions, these will be mainly negotiated in London between Mr. Fraser and .and may not sfefcy, save incidentally, in the local negotiations of the Companies' representatives with the Sheikh. (iv) The Quest inn of the nerson to represent the Gulf Coy, inhnnal negotiations . Their own proposal was to employ Major Holmes, and Mr. Fraser had originally supoo sed/supposed that, since Major Holmes is a British subject, w this plan would be agreeable to H.M.G. Sir J. Cadnian fully appreciated the difficulties regarding Major Holmes resulting from his conduct at Bahrein, the fact that, as is generally known in the Gulf, he has been removed from his post by the Bahrein Petroleum Coy., and the fact that he is not persona grata with the local British authorities. Nevertheless, Sir J. Caitaan)pointed out r that, from the point of view of securing the success of negotiations, it mig^it be better to accept the Gulf Coy.'s proposal rather than ask them to employ someone else (presumably an American), because, if Major Holmes were excluded at this stage, his capacity and opportunities for intrigue might be much more dangerous than if he were employed as a negotiatoiy especiall)' as iu anticipated that the real conduct of the negotiations will be in the hands of the representative of the A.P.0.0., and that Major Holmes's role will be quite secondary. ao rC orer, if he ^showed signs of giving trouble, Mr. Fraslrwouirhav^no hesitation in removing him. It was agreed that there was great force in Sir J. Cadman's view that it would be better to take Major Holmes alongFar M A* COafflDSiraiAL. IKDIA 0 I’M OS. P.Z.XOl/34.

Mr.Eraser of the A.P.O.C. asked yesterday if he could come for a private snd informal talk aLout oil arrangements in Koweit in connection mth the discussions vkiich were proceeding ?ath the American company interested in that area. Mr. Walton and I saw him this morning* g B jt was made clear to Mr. Fraser that while tne India Office were responsihle for coordination in this matter tney were only one of four departments concerned and that any discussion which took place must therefore he entirely non- committal in character. Mr. Jraser agreed that this was the ease ana said that his object in asking for the interview had been to explore the ground, so that he might know what line iu was best to take with a view to securing British interests an Lis discussions with the Gulf Oil Company* 3* Agreement with the Gulf O il Comp_ai^/« ft Mr. Fraser said that the 50/50 arrangement had now been ratified by the Gulf Oil Company, who were apparently well satisfied with it. The effect would be that the 50/50 would extend to holding, marketing, sale and Directors. (For exploitation see para.V (b) below). The Chairman would have no casting vote, and would be merely a Director. He would in alternate years normally be a British and a U.S.subject, hny single Director could, in the absence of the other directors who represented the interest to which he belonged, use the2 . proxies of tnose Directors, The Company would* however, he a British company, registered in Great Britain and would itself operate the concession. It would probably be known as the Koweit Oil Company and steps for its immediate registration would be taken* 4* It was pointed out to Mr, Fraser that the discussion which had been provisionally arranged between Sir John Cadman and Sir Louis Kershaw on the question of the approval stated to have been given by H.M.G, to a 50/50 arrangement had not yet taken place; that it would be essential in the first instance to clear up the position as regards this, and that thk appf be assumed. Mr, Fraser expressed great concern at the thought of anything developing which would upset the arrangement which had.been reached. The A.P.O.C. had kept their Government Directors fully in touch wiih what was going on and had had their approval. It was agreed that this matter should be left for the discussion between Sir John Cadman and Sir Louis Kershaw .which was to be arranged without delay. But Mr. Fraser was also informed that so far as oil in the Gulf sheikhdoms was concerned (as distinct from oil in Persia) the India Office were now the coordinating authority, and must in future be consulted effectively in that capacity before any decisions were taken affecting those Sheikhdoms, 5 * Future procedure . Mr. Phraser said that he had discussed the situation generally with Maoor Stephens, who represented the Gulf Oil Company. He was anxious to take soundings as to the position so as to know how best to keep Major Stephens on the right track so far as British interests were concerned (consistently , of course, with his loyalty to/3. 7 -/ to him as a colleague). He felt that it was most important to reassure Major Stephens, as there was, consequent on the past history of the Moweit concession, a certain suspicion that we might wish to discriminate against American interests. He thought that, if no objection was seen (and he had suggested this to Major Stephens) the best course would be that here, as in the case of Qatar, Major Stephens and he should discuss the situation frankly with the departments concerned. He ?jas anxious, however, in the first place that Major Stephens and he should discuss the position informally and non-committally with the India Office before a formal meeting of departments took place. Mr. Hraser was informed that no objection was seen to an arrangement of this nature. It would, of course, be understood that the other departments concerned must be kept in full touch. ^ 5 # Mr. leaser indicated that the Company were preparing or had prepared a draft concession which they would wish to submit to the Sheikh of Moweit* In the drafting of the concession he had done his utmost to give full weight to the various criticisms which had been made on behalf of H.m.G of the draft Qatar concession. He had, however, thought it better to avoid the important points of principle raised on behalf of H.M.G. in connection with the Qatar concession. Mr. Fraser was informed that while it was impossible to make any statement on the subject without consultation with the other departments interested, it was probable that ohe special safeguards vUioh H.M.G. Had indicated their desire to secure in connection with the Qatar concession would with certain modifications he thought equally desirable in the case of Kovjeit. The question of exploitation -.’ias one of particular difficulty.The subsequent discussion may conveniently b; resumed as follovm/; Britisn control . This is disposed of by the information given in para *3 above• (b} British local exploitation , The political difficulties v/hich might arise in connection with exploitation, save by British personnel, were brought to Mr * Eraser 1 s notice. He said he appreciated these and also that our attitude was not one of discrimination against the Americans, but of safeguarding the interests of the undertaking and its personnel. At the same time them would probable be considerable difficulty with the Americans in securing their formal agreement to solely British exploitation if we made this 3 conditions of our approval. Moreover, it might well be essential that certain higher grade foreign technical personnel should oe brought in 0 Every/ LEvery caro would, of course, be taken by the Company to secure that only the best type of foreigner was employed so far as it might oe necessary to employ them in Qatar. Mr. Eraser's attention was drawn to the provision on this subject in the Bahrein Petroleum Company's agreement, which ' r ”° a * aot ' L - a u0 xUni iii_®£ien.so• He was understood to say that he aid not anticipate serious difficulty in securing a corresponding provision, which would of course give a ceitain liberty to import expert American personnel, in the noweit concession. The fact that we had been able to secure a P rovision 0± PP iis nature from an American company such as the B.P.o. ought very much to simplify matters. His own feeling was that if the Americans were satisfied that they were receiving a straight deal from us in Koweit they would probably not press for a large percentage of American personnel. Secondly, he thought that they would ultimately in practice find it most convenient that Koweit should be staffed from the British staffs of the A.P.0.0, at Abadan. Chief Local Representative . Mr. Praser, on hearing the terms of the agreement accepted on this point by the B.P.C., thought that serious difficulty should not arise in securing a corresponding undertaking from the Koweit Oil Company. The Chief Local Representative of the Company would not necessarily be an independent official, but might be the Geologist, Field Manager, or other suitable individual designated byrnthe Company from among its local staff to act as the channel of communication with the Sheikh through the P.A. and dispose of any questions which might arise with the P.A. (d) Question of negotiations and employment of Major Holmes . Mr. Fraser said that he now realised that there were certain difficulties in connection with Major Holmes«Ware these•i O' really serious? The A.P.C.C. had originally thought that British interests might be served by the employment of a .uritisli suDjQct 'bo nosro'b 1 p* ■ bp *^m , T ° * .^nu they understood too that Muj or ho lines had pro at i % i -i v-, ~p -&gt; oiecib 10Cctl influence and knowledge. In any negotiation he would, of course, be kept under his (Mr. Fraser's) control, and would be removed without hesitation if . he misbehaved. Mr. Fraser in reply was informed briefly of nature of the difficulties which had arisen -with Major Holmes and told tnat the difficulties were quite definitely us, c.nd that, while Major Holmes had great knowledge, it would probably not make for easy relations with the local political authorities if he were employed. Mr. Fraser enquired whether we had rather seen an American used as negotiator on behalf of the American interests than Major Holmes. He was informed in reply that, while we could not say so definitely without further consideration, it was not impossible that this nngnt be the case. Major Holmes’s record in Bahrein had been very unfortunate and it would be difficult to repose confidence in him. There had also been difficulties in Koweit owing to hio endeavours to short circuit tlie P.A. Mr. Fraser suggested tnat if this was the case we might at the meeting with Major Stephens say frankly that certain difficulties had arisen in th past with Major Holmes which would make us regard his nominatioj to negotiate in the present instance as an unfortunate one, and that we should, # it this view was accepted by the interested Departments, ask Major Stephens whether he could not suggest sor alternative nomination. Could he not, for instance, go himselJ or perhaps nominate some American representative of the Company' His own (Mr. Fraser’s) feeling was that we might be able to droj Major Holmes in this way. The important thing was not to give the Americans the idea that we were endeavouring to handicap then he thought himself that there might be a great deal to be said for/for getting Major Stephens to go out to conduct part, or the whole, of the negotiations as representing the American interests, in which event he (Mr. Fraser) would probably arrange that Mr. Gass from Abadan should deal with the matter on behalf of the A.P.O.C. It would reassure the Gulf Oil Company as to our attitude towards them and would have a good effect on Major Stephens personally. It was agreed that this question must be considered further. (e) Position of the P.A. (hiring negotiations. After considerable discussion on this point it appeared that difficulty would be unlikely to arise with the E owe it Oil Company if H.M.G. were to suggest as a compromise (i) that all written communications should pass through the P.A. (ii) that the P.A. should be present at all discussions between the Sheikh and the representatives of the Company• The representatives of the Company would, however, subject to the P.A.'s presence, be allowed to deal direct orally with the Sheikh. (f) defining arrangement s. Mr. Fraser was asked whether the Eoweit Oil Company would contemplate refining in Koweit. The point was one 01 considerable importance and interest, particularly to the Admiralty. We understood that the Standard Oil were re lining in Hasa. He said in reply that great difficulty might arise over any such condition, although in principle it was admituedly desirable on commercial grounds to refine locally. Iw was difficult to expect a company to commit itself positively j-or many years ahead. There would be no difficulty in arranging j-or local refining sufficient to meet the needs of The Sheikh and cl Eoweit, but the position aw regards general rexining was different. There was an increasing tendency for oil to be retired in the country in which it is consumed. ii S K0 CL /k Asked whether he saw any technical difficulty about refining locally in Koweit as the result of lack of water etc., he was I (unable to coramit himself. The point was left. (g) Pre-emption in time of war . Attention was also dravui to the possible importance from the point of view of H.M.G. of being able to secure that oil produced in the concession could oe purchased by tnem ac a fair price in time of war. Here again Mr. Fraser was extremely non-commital. He said that his own experience in connection with the purchase of oil during the lar had been than sa^eguaias devised we 11 in advance or a situation rarely in ract achieved their object. The point was not pursued. 8 , In conclusion Mr. Fraser said that he would at any time be very glad to give any assistance possible in connection with concessions in the Gulf in which the A.P.O.C. were interested and that he felt that the establishment ox conuaco between the Company and the Departments would demux be^y bvi. w a very useful purpose.

The company was equally owned by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) and the Gulf Oil Corporation of the United States, but the agreement provided that the Kuwait Oil Company should be a British company.The file covers: minutes of meetings at the India Office between British Government officials and representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and later the Kuwait Oil Company; the personnel of the Kuwait Oil Company, including British emphasis on the need for the employees of the company to be British subjects, or subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait; the requirements of the Admiralty; drafts of, comments on, and full text (folios 6-7) of the political agreement (signed on 5 March 1934: signed copy, folios 26-27); discussion of the pre-emption clause in the agreement (designed to meet the British Government's oil needs in the event of a state of national emergency or war); discussion of requirements for landing grounds and air facilities in Kuwait, including correspondence from the Air Ministry; the recommendation of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that APOC should be required to give an assurance that actual oil exploitation should be in British hands only, and that the American interest of the group should be purely financial (folios 174-175); discussion of communications requirements (telegraph, wireless, and telephone); the need to persuade the Shaikh of Kuwait of the strength of the new company, to diminish the risk of his turning towards the Standard Oil Company of California (folio 101); APOC agreement to inform HM Government of any intention to transfer any part of its 50% holding in the Kuwait Oil Company to another company (folios 83-90); the Admiralty's desire that the political agreement should not be communicated to the Shaikh of Kuwait until the commercial agreement was signed, in case Standard Oil used it to advance their claims to the concession (folio 16); and text of the commercial agreement between the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Kuwait Oil Company (folios 8-11).The file also contains papers relating to the Qatar oil concession. Most of the correspondence is from John Charles Walton of the India Office, and other British Government officials; the file also includes correspondence from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.Kuwait generally appears in the papers in the form Koweit.One document is dated 1914 (folios 91-93).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
