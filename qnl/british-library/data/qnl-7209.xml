Saud and his brother Abdullah, sons of the late Chief of Nejd, Feysal, had been engaged in a civil war, in which Turkey took the side of Abdullah. In aiding him with troops, the Turks availed themselves of the opportunity to extend their dominions along the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf as far as Katif. They occupied Bidaa and quartered a body of troops there. They even claimed the island of Bahrein as tributary to them. They aided the Bedouin tribe of Beni Hajir to make raids on that island and the town of Zobarah on the Katar coast opposite it, where the Beni Naim tribe had placed itself under fhe protection of the Chief of Bahrein. They also encouraged Nasir bin Mobarik, the leading member of the rival branch of the family of the Sheikhs of Bahrein, in his piracies against the coast of Bahrein and Katar. They further gained over to their side Jasim, son of Mahomed bin Thani, Chief of Bidaa, and connived at his outrages against British Indian subjects. In this period we find such outrages against British subjects frequently recurring at Bidaa. The British Government took measures to put down the piracies and punish the perpetrators of the out rages. The introduction of the Turkish element into the Katar peninsula tended thus only to give a fresh impetus to disorder in the Persian Gulf. The British Government had therefore, though after some vacillation arising from a regard to the susceptibilities of the Porte, to make up its mind to deal directly with the piratical tribes of the Katar coast, where the Turkish Government claimed jurisdiction, without regard to the Porte's claims Sheikh Jasim, under Turkish encouragement, attempted to settle his own tribe at Odeid; but the Bri tish Government opposed this attempt, since that town was an hereditary appanage of the Chief of Abu Thabi, one of the Trucial chiefs that are entitled to British protection. The Turks attempted to create a new settlement of a tribe under their protection at Zobarah and employed Sheikh Jasim to gain their purpose, but in this attempt too they were frustrated by the timely action of the British Government. At first the British Government were Inclined to view the presence of the Turks with some complacency, expecting they would co -operate with the British in maintaining order in the Gulf. But it was soon found that the Turkish jurisdiction in Katar was merely nominal, and it being a source of disorder on its coast and menace to the independence and peace of the Chief of Bahrein and the Trucial chiefs in the Oman, the British Govern' ment took every opportunity to disclaim the Turkish claim to that jurisdic tion, though occasionally their disclaimers were not very distinctly and clearly expressed. The precis below will trace the progress of the events foreshadowed above. Turkish movements in Katar,—1873. 2. There had been at this time rumours of movement of Turkish troops to Letter No. 37, dated leth Angast 1873. Ojair from Katif ; but Major Grant, First Pol. a., December 1873, No. 412. Assistant Political Resident, who had been asked to make enquiries, reported to Colonel Ross on 16th August 1873 that the rumour was incorrect and that the fact was that a detachment of some ] 00 men had embarked at Katif to accompany the Turkish Officer Hossein Effendi to Zobarah on the mainland, some 20 miles south of Bahrein. In a conversation with Major Grant, the Chief of Bahrein claimed the Naim tribes, living near Zobarah, as his subjects under treaty, and stated that when he became Chief of Bahrein, the Chief of the Naim tribe had in Colonel Felly's presence acknowledged subjection to Bahrein under treaty. Major Grant wrote2 to Colonel Boss that he had no means of forming an opinion on the claim advanced by the Bahrein Chief to sovereignty over the Nairn tribe, but from verbal information he inferred that any power exercised by Bahrein of late years over that tribe had been merely nominal, if it existed at all. 3. In order to obtain more particulars of the alleged intended Turkish expedition, Major Grant sent a messenger to Katar, who reported that Hossein Effendi was said to have gone to Zobarah for the purpose of inducing the Chief of the Naim tribe to come under Turkish rule. Major Grant said this was mere coffee-room gossip and nothing new ; he advised the Chief of Bahrein to refer to Colonel Boss regarding the claim of the Naim tribes for protection against the Turkish Government. Chief of Bahrein advised to keep aloof from complications in Katar— 1873. 4. Colonel Boss replied on receiving Major Grant's report that, though Letter No. dated 28th August 1873. the matter of sovereignty over Katar had Pol. a ., Wccmber 1873, No. 415. apparently never been formally decided, still the Turkish authorities in Nejd had established an influence over the Katar Coast as far as the Odeid boundary. He thought the Bahrein Chief had not the power, if he wished, to protect tribes residing in Katar, and that he could not expect Government to interfere where the rights were involved in uncertainty. The Chiefs allied with Bahrein could choose between remaining where they were and removing to Bahrein with the latter's permission. He said that Colonel Pelly had always counselled the Chief of Bahrein to remain strictly neutral under the then existing circumstances, to keep aloof from all complications on the mainland with the Turks, Wahabis, &amp;c., and that the Chief should continue so to act. Colonel Boss desired Major Grant to communicate thus with Bahrein with reference to his appeal for advice, and to dissuade him from acting contrary to it. 5. In writing to Government, Colonel Boss thought that, as the question Letter No. 1115-135, dated 4th September 1873. Sovereign and feudal rights OVCr plaCCS Pol. a,, December 1873, No. 411. and tribes on the mainland of Arabia op posite to Bahrein, was a complicated one, probably Government would not deem it practicable or expedient to enter into its merits. He said :—- ' The question of the sovereignty over Katar generally has never yet been decided. It has perhaps been a debateable Iand ; between Oman on one side and the Wahabee power on the other. At one time, the Chief of Aboothabee is said to have exercised authority in Katar. Later the Uttoobees having settled there and at Bahrein, became paramount. These in turn had to pay religious tithe to the Wahabee Ameer, who established a Governor of his own at Biddah. Since the Turkish occupation of El Hassa the whole line of CDa ^t as far as Odeid has fallen under Turkish influence, and the Chiefs in general have been forced or in duced to accept the Turkish flag. Bidaa has been actually occupied, and a body of Turkish troops is now quartered there/' He proceeded to say that in October 1871 Colonel Pelly had obtained per mission from the Bombay Government to defer reporting on the question of sovereignty over Katar as there was a probability of the Turks withdrawino- from Nejd. He thought the antual position of affairs at Katar did not afford cause of complaint against the Turkish authorities, but that any move of the Turks further East than they then were, would undoubtedly be an encroach ment on Oman territory and would affect the Trucial Chiefs. 6. These papers were sent to Colonel Pelly for any remarks he might have Letter dated 27th October 1873. to offer. He replied that it was an old and Poi. a., December 1873, No. 420. somewhat perplexing question. As the political situation on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf was unchanged since he was asked for his opinion two years previously, he adhered to that opinion, viz., that ' we should avoid as far as possible for the present mooting questions of territorial sovereignty He alluded to the repeated written assurances of the Porte that it had no intention of interfering with the independence of our Trucial Chiefs, a general declaration which would be more valuable than any special definition. The time for effectively dealing with questions of boundary and supremacy would be when Turksh aggression had taken permanent form3 or been abandoned. He considered that the Chief of Bahrein shonld adhere to the arrangemeots made in 1869, and while acknowledged to possess certain rights of pasturage, &amp;c., on the Katar Coast, he should not therefore be held to be empowered to put to sea for the purpose of coercing any port in Katar. He thought Odeid was subordinate to Abuthabi, but that the question should not be touched till the intention of the Turkish Government in striving to occupy the Arabian littoral should be manifested, or if that occupation, proved to be part of a scheme between Turkey and Hussia, the matter might become very grave, for it would mean a dominating influence in the Hed Sea and in the Gulfs of Oman and Persia, 7. Meanwhile Colonel Ross reported that on the 2nd September the Chief Letter Nos, ii9i-i47, dated 19th September 1873. of Bahrein again, asserted his sovereicrnty Poi. a ., December, p. 421. ovei , gobarah and the Nairn tribe under treaty, and asked whether he should relinquish them or allow them to remain as they were. Major Grant atter consulting the Treaties (Vol. VII., Nos. 72 and 73) had arrived at the conclusion :— 'That there is no special mention made in the Treaties of EI Nairn or of Zobarah, Aitchiton Treaties—Vol. 7. though in Article I of No. 72 there is mention made of the dependencies of Bahrein, though it is not stated what those dependencies are. ' From what I have heard whilst living in Bahrein, I should say that some years ago the Naira, together with many other of the Guttur tribes, were in a certain way dependencies of Bahrein ; but the amount of authority ^xercised by the Rulers of Bahrein over Katar geems to have varied in proportion to the power of coercion those Rulers possessed : if the Chief of Bahrein was strong, the tribes acknowledged his supremacy, if he was weak, they de nied it.' Colonel Ross requested Major Grant to be guided by his former letter dated 28th August 1873 {Vide para. 4 ante). 8. Colonel Ross's letter of 28th August was approved by the Government of (Wnm-nt of i.di. letter No. 2820.P, d.t.a India and he was furnished with a copy of i7tb December 1873. Colonel Pelly s letter or 27th October, Pol. a., december, No. 426. and informed that His Excellency in Coun cil concurred generally in the views therein expressed, and that it was de sirable that the chief of Bahrein should as far as practicable abstain from in terfering in complications on the mainland. British intervention refused to Chief of Debai in case of robberies committed against vessels of his subjects on Katar coast- 1873. 9. In August 1873 the Chief of Debai complained to the political autho rities in the Persian Gulf on behalf of Poi.A., December 1873, Noi. los-ioB. certain Nakhodas of vessels, of robberies committed on them at Katar, and prayed for British intervention on the ground that the British Government had undertaken to maintain the peace of the sea. The Political Resident in his reply dated 13th September 1873 to the Chief however pointed out ff But the British Government never undertook and will not undertake to interfere with occurrences on land and the matters you referred to, take place on land; moreover the robberies were apparently committed by disorderly Turkish soldiers over whom the Arab Chiefs of Guttur themselves have no control. 'It is well known they themselves endure many annoyances without power to prevent them. ' It would he therefore best for you to warn your people against landing in places where they are subject to ill-treatment at the hands of people over whom the chiefs have no oontrol. ,, 10. The Government of India entirely approved of the tenour of this reply and instructed the Resident that if the Poi. a ., December 1873, No. 108. local chiefs could not grant redress in the matter of the robberies, the facts should be reported to the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, for submission to the Governor-General at Baghdad.4 Threatened attack on Bahrein and Zobarah by the Bedouin tribes of Beni Hajir. 1874. 11. The Beni-Hajir tribe of Bedouins, residing in the Katar peninsula, by Pol. a.. November 1874. No.. 162-165. oi ^ P^acies, played a prominent part in the history of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf during this period. About the middle of the year 1873 it was reported that a body of 300 to 400 Bedouins of the tribe were making serious attempts to secure boats for the purpose of making a piratical attack on Bahrein. The Chief of the island made preparations to meet them, and the May Frere and Mugh Bose cruised along the coast of Katar to overawe them. This had an effect in checking their movements, but they still waited for a favourable opportunity to make a sudden raid. The Resident in these circumstances, telegraphed on the 5th September 1874 as follows :— A Bedouin tribe of Nejd have been making serions attempt to cross from mainland on a piratical raid against Bahrein, hitherto they have been frustrated by presence of J/ay Frere and Hugh Rose. Jt is feared they may procure boats from one of the posts under Turkish authority and renew their attempts 1 solicit authority to communicate with Colonel Herbert in view of orders being issued to the Turkish Governors to forbid the Arabs acting from their territory. I have made urgent requisition to Senior Naval Officer for a vessel of war to proceed to Bahrein.' 12. The reply sent to him by the Government of India was as follows: ' Take effective steps to defend Bahrein against aggression by any Chiefs or tribes of the Gulf. Marine Departmemt requested to send quicldy a vessel of war. Make no reference to Colonel Herbert, but communicate facts and these instructions to Minister at Tehran for information of Persian Government.' 13. It was found afterwards unnecessary to despatch another vessel, the Pol. A., November 1874, No. 169. alread y, at Bahrein.' On Poi. a , November 1874, No. is*. 12th oeptember 1874 the Resident again telegraphed ' The Beni Hajir tribe referred to in my telegram of fifth, having procured a few boats from Bidaa, portion of them embarked. Their designs as against Bahrein were frustrated bv movements of Bombay Marine vessels. They however plundered a Bahrein trading vessel before abandoning boats. Subsequently they attacked fort of Zobarah opposite Bahrein. Appearance of Hugh Roue off Zobarah intimidated Beni Hajir, and prevented capture of place*, which would have given them possession of boats and imperilled Bahrein. The Is!aim tribe of Zobarah returning hastily from Pearl Banks and Bahrein attacked and severely defeated Beni Hajir. An Agent of Governor of Lahsa reported to have accompanied and incited the Beni Hajir. Danger to Bahrein from that tribe considered over for present. Her Majesty 's steamer Magpie arrived Bahrein on 12th. It is important one Royal Navy vessel remains there for present. Am requesting Senior Naval Otlicer accordingly, and beg Government instruc- tim may also be given to that effect. Full particulars of occurrences submitted by post. In structions in your message of 1-ith carried out.' 14. In forwarding copy of this telegraphic correspondence to the Secretary of State, the suggestion was made that— the circumstances reported by Colonel Ross should be communicated to the Government of the Sublime Porte through Her Majesty's Minister at Constantinople, who might be in structed to represent that, if these tribes be under the authority of Turkey, they should be restrained by the Government of the Sultan. If, however, Bahrein is attacked, action on the part of the British authorities in repelling the tribe will not be delayed.' 16. In a letter dated 12th September 1874, the Resident reported, in more Pol. a., November 1874, No. 187. detail, the proceedings of the Beni liajir and their defeat at Zobarah by the El Nairn tribe, whose Chief was a kind of feudatory of the Sheikh of Bahrein The more important portions of his letter relate to the alleged countenance atforded them by Bazech, the Turkish Governor of A1 Hasa, in this raid : from two independent sources it was reported that his Agent, one Nasir bin Juhr bin Salim, had influenced and abetted the tribe in their lawless aggressions and had accompanied them towards Zobarah. The Resident added— 4 ' Considerirg the lawless nature of the object of the Beni Hajir, and their having engaged in open piracy on the sea, it might be deemed advisable to enquire from the Turkish Government as to the part taken by this Agent in the aggressive and piratical proceeding reported.'5 16. Commenting on our obligation under the Treaty of 1861 to prevent and employ force against aggressive enterprises of this nature, he noted as one o£ our preventive measures the assistance of the various Chieftains of the Katar Coast, who, it was understood, were held responsible in these matters for their immediate coast line. This responsibility the Chief of Bidaa, or at any rate his son, Jasim bin Mahomed, was prepared to evade on the plea that they were under Turkish influence. ' It is, therefore, now, I think, a matter for consideration whether the Turkish Government should not be asked to state clearly for what portions of the coast they undertake to be responsible.' The Resident also mentioned the insecurity of the Chief of Bahrein's position owing to the enmity of the other branch of the family, the secret sympathy of the Turks, and his own want of conciliation towards the Arab Chiefs and others as a reason for anticipating an early change in the position of affairs. 17. In reply to these letters the Government of India instructed him not to hold communications with the local Turkish officials regarding Bahrein. 'Any necessary representations can, under present cirsumstances, bemadawith more effect through Her Majesty^s Ambassador at Constantinople under instructions from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Interference in the affairs of Bahrein and of the Arab Chiefs on the Coast should^ as far as practicable, be limited to protecting the legitimate interests of British subjects, maintaining our Treaty rights, and. performing our Treaty obligations. When these are affected it will be proper to take steps to put matter right; otherwise the less interference you exercise the better 18. The defeat of the Beni Hajir by the El Nairn tribe apparently dis couraged the former from attempting any further warlike movements, and. seven of them were said to have been arrested by Jasim bin Mahomed for plundering a Bahrein boat, in which he had a considerable sum of money, but the Turks took advantage of these disturbances to send their gun-boat, the Iskenderia, to the Katar Coast apparently to make enquiries concerning them ; the result being that her Commander seemed to have taken the Chiefs of Bidaa and the Agent of the Governor of Lahsa to task for their share in causing them. Apprehended attack of Nasir bin Mobarik on Katar and Bahrein— 1874. 19. Nasir bin Mobarik soon afterwards left Hasaand arrived on the Katar Coast, where his presence could not fail to cause additional anxiety as regards Bahrein. He wrote to the Resident stating that he had been for the last six years deprived of his just rights in Bahrein which was the property of all his family, and begging that the British Government would not prohibit his getting these rights. The Resident in reply told him that any attempts at aggression would meet with the active opposition of the British Government. He found that the Chief of Bahrein was in a state of anxiety about the pre sence of Nasir bin Mobarik on the Katar Coast, and the possibility of his receiving assistance from the Chief of Bidaa and the Katar people generally in an attack on Bahrein :— ' Sheikh Esau in dwelling on the danger to his Government from the propinquity o£ Nasir bin Mobarik, expressed his desire tbat I should take steps to prevent the Katar Chief harbouring him or assisting him in any operations against Zobarah by land or sea. I informed the Chief tbat I could not undertake to interfere except to repress movements by sea. The ChieE of Bahrein being apprehensive of an attack on his allies, and as he considers, subjects, who hold the fort of Zobarah, asked whether he would be allowed to reinforce the garrison of that place, which he considered a dependency of Bahrein. Sheikh Esau necessarily relies much on the Naim tribe of Zobarah, who came to his aid in his late dangers, and if he were to be deprived of their support, his means of defence would be greatly weakened. A refusal on his part to aid the Naim garrison of Zobarah if attacked by other Arab tribes of Katar would undoubtedly lose the friendship of that tribe for Sheikh Esau. &lt;f My reply to the Chief was to the effect that I would as before advise him as far as possible to keep free o£ the feuds on the mainland. That as regards succouring Zobarah I would not interfere with the despatch of reinforcements as a purely defensive measure •, but that it was for the Chief himself to judge as to the necessity for, or expediency of, the measure. 1 likewise enjoined him to carefully abstain from taking any part in the operations in which the Turkish Government were engaged.'6 20, The Kesident was informed by telegram that if the Chief took any part in complications by land, Government would not guarantee him protection. More detailed instructions were sent by post to the following effect (Proceedings Political A. Pebruary 1875, No. 303) ' The Governor-General in Council observes that by the correspondence marginally noted arte' 1115-135 ' dated 4th September 1873, para. 5 it was shown that the Chief of Bahrein had no No. 1191.147,dated 19th September 1873, para. 7 possessions on the mainland of Katar, and that onte. his rights there were of a very uncertain character*. Accordingly in the letter from this Office to your address, No. '2829-P., dated 17th December 1873, you were informed that it was desirable that the Chief should abstain, as far as prac- ticable^ from interfering in complications on the mainland. ' His Excellency in Council, therefore, considers that the Chief of Bahrein should not. have been encouraged to despatch troops to the mainland for the reinforcement of his allies, the Naim tribe. On the contrary, he should be advised to rely for support on the assistance of the British Government, which will, if necessary, be given him either to repel attacks by sea or to frustrate a threatening movement from the mainland. ^ It should be clearly pointed out to the Chief that so long as he adheres to his treaty obligations, the British Government will protect him; but if such protection is to be accorded to him, he must not be the aggressor or undertake measures, which will involve him in com plications and which are considered inadvisable by the British Government,' (1) Complaints of Turkey about Chief of Bahrein's encroachments in Katar, (2) the Chief advised to avoid being involved in complica tions on the mainland—1874—1875. 21. In his letter No. dated 19th December 1874, Lieutenant-Colonel Koss reported:— Pol. A, February 1875, No. 319. ' From Colonel Herbert 's communications and , w ^ ^ tte accompaniments, it appears that the Wali of Baghdad has telegraphed to the Ottoman Porte complaining— ' 1^—That the Chief of Bahrein had acted against the Turkish Government in several instances. ' J~That a British vessel had attacked the Beni Hajir tribe and killed twenty-two persons. This latter statement is of course mere fiction. The proceedings of the Hugh Rose the No. 1039-209, dated 12th September 1874, and ^ ™ accompaniments, para. 13 ante. P® 1^. letter as per margin, and occasioned no loss of life whatever. 'The oomplaints alleged against the Chief of Bahrein in this instance are that he reinforced the Nairn tribe when attacked by the Beni Hajir, and also repaired the fort of Zobarah. The real question of importance is of course not so much what the proceedings of th a Sheikh of Bahrein were, as whether his proceedings under the circumstances of the case could be fairly viewed as hostile to the Turkish Government. 'This would evidently depend in the first instance on the status of the Naim tribe of Zobarah with reference to Turkish authority ; the sovereignty over Zobarah; the subjects and designs of the Beni Hajir; and the part which the recognized Turkish authorities mio-ht openly have taken. 13 ' It will be observed that the complaints of the Turkish Governor-General are founded on misrepresentations on all these points. In fact a conclusion is sought to be drawn from false premises. ' What is implied by Redif Pasha is that the Naim tribe at Zobarah had been subjected to Turkish authority, and were in revolt: that Zobarah is a Turkish possession and that the Beni HajiVs late acts and movements were undertaken openly under the authoritv of th&amp; Turkish Government for the purpose of assisting that power in punishing its' revolted subjects. 'It is not unlikely that the Turkish Pasha himself may have been misled by untruthful representations of local Agents and interested persons, but it is certain that he has made a Respective titles of Bahrein and Tar- ^ The portion of key to Zobarah.. JMaim tribe residing at Zobarah had not either avowed allegiance to Turkey nor been re duced to subjection, so tnat it is impossible they could be in the position of revolted subjects. As regards Zobarah, that place has been hitherto considered by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, past and present, as a dependency of the Island, and used as a summer residence. Without entenno- on tie Bahrein claim, it is at least certain that the Turkish Government have never directly or indirectly assumed possession of the place&gt; or openly claimed Their pretensions are put,^ f With regard to the assertion that the Beni Hajir were acting in co-operation with Tur kish authority ^ merely for the purpose of chastising a rebel tribe, it will be observed that this statement is built on a previous misrepresentation. But the facts also were otherwise. It was a notorious; undisguised fact, that the primary object of the Beni Rajir was, as on former occasions, the attack and plunder of Bahrein. Else why should they have seized boats and put to sea and plundered Bahrein craft ? It is somewhat surprising that Turkish authori- ties should go so far as to avow a participation in the predatory acts of a thievish horde guilty of at least one act of open piracy on the seas. 1 ' That in reality the Beni Hajir were instiorated by local Agents of Turkey to attempt Bahrein and failing that to attack Zobarah seems quite clear, but it was probably not at first contemplated to avow these proceedings openly. e( The actual part taken by the Chief of Bahrein in the crisis is fully detailed in my reports noted in the margin and accompaniments.

Denial of his having count enanced the Nairn would be equally out of place with admission of his culpability as towards Turkey. ' f It is possible the Turkish Government when fully aware of the true state of the case may not be as anxious as the Pasha of Baghdad to assume the responsibility which must attach to an avowal of having instigated the proceedings of the Beni Hajir, but if the latter are the acknowledged Agents and dependents of the Turkish Government, and have avowedly acted under its instructions, I would respectfully urge that the Turkish authorities should be held to account for the robberies the Beni Hajir have already committed, and for any predatory acts they may commit on the seas in the future. u i would also take leave to point out that the presence of Nasir bin Mobarik on the sea coast as a protege of the Turkish authorities is a standing menace to the existing Government of Bahrein. That individual has been considered by the British Government as a pirate and enemy, and it would perhaps not be thought unreasonable to demand that he should be restrained from acting against interests which the British Government is concerned with. u The chief cause of embarrassment as regards the maintenance of peace and neutrality by sea between Bahrein and Katar lies in the present uncertainty as to the question with whom responsibility rests. The various mainland Sheikhs may shelter themselves under Turkish protection whilst the latter power has not formally assumed Government duties. Were the responsibilities more decidedly fixed the constant inconvenient anxiety about Bahrein would disappear.' 22. On the same date Colonel Hoss reported to Government (No. 1433-306, Political A, February 1875, Proceedings No. 323, December 1874) the reply of the Chief of Bahrein to the communica tion of Government of India's telegram of 10 th December, in which he stated that the object of his sending help to Zobarah was to defend his own island, not to encroach on his neighbours, and intimated his readiness to he guided by the policy of Government. 23. Colonel Ross reported on 3rd April 1875 (No. 407-107) that the Chief of 1875. Bahrein persisted in declaring the whole -p , . ,, - 0 _ c XT oor of Katar to be subject and tributary to Political A, May 1875, Nos. 35i-366. -n i • x i « i i , - kt Bahrein. In paragraph 2 of letter No. Political a . May W6, No. 363. 1342-P., dated 10th May 1875. Colonel Ross was directed to inform the Chief that:— ' His Excellency in Council observes with regret that the Chief still manifests a disposition to entangle himself in the affairs of the mainland of Katar. He should now be made clearly to understand that if he persists in a course opposed to the advice of the Government of India and is thereby involved in complications on the mainland, the consequences will be upon himself, and that the British Government will hold themselves free to take such measures with respect to him as they may think necessary.' 24. The purport of this letter was conveyed to the Chief by Lieutenant Eraser, Political Assistant, in person. In reply, the Chief stated that he under stood ^ 'the orders of Government to prohibit interference on the mainland and especially at Zobarah.' He added that he had obeyed the order— ' The reason of our not interfering in the affairs of Zobarah at this time is simply obedience to the orders of Government, not that our rights have become invalid or extinct/' At the same time he sent his brother to make the following 1 requests to Colonel Ross '1. That the evacuation of Zobarah should be delayed till after the pearl fishery season, as during this time all the trustworthy adherents of the Sheikh were absent, and the island was.8 peculiarly liable to attack.' Colonel Ross replied that he could not countenance any further delay in withdrawing from Zobarah. 2. That a vessel-of-war might remain continuously at Bahrein/ ; This Colonel^ Ross declined to promise during the hot season, though he added that cruisers should visit the island as often as possible, and prompt assistance be afforded in case of attack. ' 3. That Zobarah might be restored some time or other.' On this point Colonel Ross did « Vf ! * c 4. v. le'rr xu„ qa qo not think that the British Government would alter Political A., September 1875, Nos. 34-39, t x* * ii. t . i i their decision. In reporting* the above Lolonel •Nos. 667-171, dated Busbire, 28th June 1875. Ross pointed out that the words 'prohibit' and 1 Government order' were the ChieFs own choosing, and he expressed the opinion that any attempt to explain the difference between advice and order would probably unsettle the Chiefs mind and weaken the effect of the intimation Political A., September 187 o.

On the 20th February 1875 (No. 133) Colonel Ross reported that the Beni Hajir were moving in the direction of Zobarah. Latent j No. 210, dated Bahrein. April 1875. on, information was received that the Beni political a., June 1875, Nos. 209 -212. Hajir had been attacked by the Nairn tribe, who carried off some head of cattle; whereupon the Beni Hajir retaliated by attacking Zobarah and also making off with certain plunder. So far Sheikh Esau kept himself aloof from any participation in the quarrel, but in August of the same year having been informed by his pearl divers that some of the^Beni Hajir had ' embarked in a boat with the intention of disturbing the peace at sea and committing acts of piracy,' he despatched five armed vessels of his own to pursue the offenders to ' Khor Push,' 1 a creek near Shargah about 250 miles from Bahrein. Colonel Ross disapproved of the action Political a ., October 1875, Nos 15-18. of the Chief on this occasion, and pointed § No. 356, dated 24tb August 1875. out to him in a letter§ that the circum stances of the case in no way necessitated the measures taken, and that the use of armed boats should be strictly confined to the defence of Bahrein and its waters. The Government of India, while approving of Colonel Ross's proceed ings, thought it advisable to ' use even firmer language to Sheikh Esau, who had lately shown a disposition to be very I aggressive.' Colonel Eoss was according. ly instructed || to remind ' Sheikh Esau of his Treaty engagements in respect to acts of aggression or retaliation by sea, and to warn the Chief in plain language that if he violated those engagements, he cannot emain a friend of the British Government.'' 25-A. But before this letter reached Colonel Ross, he had deputed Lieutenant Fraser to Bahrein to enquire into the facts of the pursuit of the Beni Hajir. The Chief threw the responsibility on his brother Ahmed, who he said had insti gated the pursuit and then carried it out against his (the Chief's) wishes. In a Political a ., November 1875, No«. 288-290. subsequent letter^ the Government of ^ No. 314.3-p., dated 30th November 1875. India drew the attention of Colonel Ross to the error committed by Sheikh Ahmed, which had led to a violation of the Treaty stipulations, and be was desired «to place the matter before the Chief in such a light, as would leave no room for further mis apprehension.' 26. In July** 1876 the Resident, Persian Gulf, reported that the Beni Hajir tribe, had split up into two factions the Ayyal-i-Shafi and the Ayyal-i-Shawan. *♦ Political A., September 1876, Nos. 218-222. f ormer allied themselves with Nasir bin Mobarik, the notorious pirate, and the latter with the Sheikhs of Nairn and Zobarah. In consequence of the friendship existing between the Nairn tribe and the Sheikh of Bahrein it was feared that the alliance concluded be tween them and the Ayyal-i-Shawan might lead to Sheikh Esau taking their9 part, sliould tlley proceed to hostilities with the Beni Hajir. Colonel Ross was political a., september 1876, nog. ji8-122. therefore desired* to express to Sheikh * no. 2092-p ., dated i4th September 1876. Esau the expectation of the Governor- General in Council that he would keep aloof from all inter-tribal disputes or 1877&lt; arrangements on the mainland. In the autumn of 1877 it came to the knowledge political a., december 18/7, nob. 100 -199. 0 £ jj eri Majesty's Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Chief of Bahrein was again mixing himself up in the affairs of the mainland. In a letter addressed to him by Major Grant, the Officiating Hesident, the following allegations were brought against him :— ' 1. That lie had entered into intimate and friendly relations with the Nairn tribe living in Zobarah, whom lie had subsidized and permitted to frequent his islands. '2. That the Chief had 100 men of that tribe regularly in his army at Bahrein as soldiers; that he allowed them to go to Zobarah, whenever the latter place was threatened with an attack by Bedouins, and that not long- ago he actually despatched a strong body of armed men to Zobarah whom he supplied with arms and provisions. ' 3. That the Cbief^ through the mediation of Nasir-bin-Jubar, Chief of the Naim tribe, had entered into friendly relations with Nasir bin Khalil el Hajjiree who was preparing to go to Bahrein with his followers/' To the above the Chief of Bahrein replied as follows ' That the Naeem tribe go to Bahrein on their own account, and that it was necessary at times to give them presents to prevent their doing mischief and joining his enemies, Nasir bin Mobarik and others. ' 2. That he was in the habit of keeping persons of the Naeem tribe in Bahrein, while the people were away at the pearl banks and the town empty. '3. That the only people, who left Bahrein for Zobarah, were those of the Naim tribe who habitually visit Bahrein for gifts, and who returned of their own accord upon hearing that a hostile force had come to attack Zobarah, bat that he furnished them with no arms. 11 4. That as regards Nasir bin Khalil el Hajjiree, that Chief asked permission to visit Bahrein with his people through Nasir bin Jubar, but he (the Bahrein Chief) refused^ per mission, neither would he accede to Nasir bin Jubbal's proposals to make peace with Nasir bin Khalil Avhen the latter suggested it. Finally that ho always acted up to the advice furnished him by Government, and always intended to do so in respect of interference with the tribes on the mainland, bub that he was much harassed Political A., December 1877, Nos. 190-193. the Badouins from the mainland against his will.' 27. In freporting the above the Political Resident drew attention to the difficulties of the Sheikh's position with t Ko. 2*8, d.t,d Buahire, 8rd Nor.mber 1877. to ^ ^ ^ mainland and added:— &lt;&lt; were he to offend the Naeem tribe by withholding presents or preventing their visiting Bahrein, the result would probably be that they would unite with the Beni Hajir in forming a hostile coalition against him.' The Government of India concurred in the views of Colonel Ross, but thought further action in the matter unnecessary. Aggressive policy of the Turks and establishment of a new Turkish province on the littoral of the Persian Gulf. 1875-76. 28. In 1875 the Turkish Government despatched Nasir Pasha, the Montefik Chief, with a large force to quell the revolt of the Wahabi Prince, Abdul Bahman, against their rule. On the restoration of order, Nasir Pasha withdrew with the Turkish forces to Basrah, and shortly afterwards he was appointed Governor of a new Turkish province formed on the littoral, consisting of Basrah audits dependencies and the province of Nejd. The establishment of this province, and more especially the appointment of Nasir Pasha, caused grave apprehension amongst the Trucial Chiefs of the coast, who addressed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject. 29. ' We,' wrote the Chief of Ummel Political A., November 1875, Nos. 62-58. TTownin n fear mischief and injury from him, we the Chiefs of the coast are under engagements with the British Government, and we trust that its favour will not be withdrawn^ and that it will protect us from harm.'10 29-A. Colonel Ross replied that the Polltioal A., November 1875, Nos. 5«-68. Chiefs mi^ht ' rest assured that tbe Bntish Government would freely and effectually maintain the friendly engagements existing between it and all the Tmcial Chiefs of the coast, and that so long as they continued to observe their engagements they might be perfectly certain that the British Government would not withdraw its friendliness and favour, and that no interference with the mutual rights and engagements would be tolerated.' Political A., November 1875, Nos. 52-58. This reply of Colonel ROSS WSS approved • No, 3064 -P., dated 19th November 1876.; of by the Government of India.* 30. The aggresnive policy of Nasir Pasha soon showed itself. In NoTem* ber 1875 Colonel Ross was informed that a Turkish vessel-of-war bad been despatched by him to the Arab coast, and that certain of the littoral Chiefs had tendered him proffers of allegiance. On this Colonel Ross remarked— &lt;s The fact seems to be that Nasir Pasha purchased his Governorship by a heavy payment and that his appointment is solely owing to this, The troops and vessels of the Turkish • Vi . 14 . ,0*/. kt 000000 Government are not placed at his orders. At the Political A., January 1876, N ob . 222-223. . .. 1 . i ,, 'NT™ same time it seems to be the case that JNaeir Pasha himself is disposed to be as aggressive od the Arab coast as he may fiud psaoticable.' ' 31. About a year later (November 1876) Captain Guthrie, Commanding the gunboat May Frere, was sent by Colonel Ross with despatches to the Chiefs of Bidaa and Odeid on the subject of certain piracies committed on the Katar coast. At Bidaa Captain Guthrie reported that he found SO or 40 Turkish soldiers under a subordi- Political A., February 1877, Ho.. l-SS. nate offioer _ ' The town pays from nine to ten thousand Krans a year to the Turkish Government, - t , ^ which is represented as not being sufficient to Political A., e ruary / , x os. . meet the cost of the few soldiers kept there, whose duties are more those of police than of a military body. While Captain Guthrie was in conversation with the Chief, the second officer of the Turks blundered in, ordered a lot of people out, and asked Bin Thani what the May Frere wanted at Bidda, to which Captain Guthrie replied, ' that is my business.' The officer followed Captain Guthrie to the beach, and as the latter was pulling off shouted to him to leave the harbour before sunset as the country was Turkish. A number of Arabs having heard the order Captain Guthrie decided on remaining at El Bidaa for 24 hours. Whilst on shore Captain Guthrie met a Sergeant in Turkish uniform, who said that he came from Peshawar, and had been a soldier at the capture of Delhi. From this man Captain Guthrie received some interesting information regarding the Turkish army in Nejd which contained, he said, at least 100 Indian subjects who could not get away. On the 18th October Captain Guthrie arrived at Odeid where he found the trucial flag flying. The Chief admitted that he paid 40 or 50 dollars yearly to the Turks, four of whom had visited Odeid in 1873, settled terms and then left. Finally, Captain Guthrie reported that the inferior character of the drinking water at Odeid had in a measure prevented the Turks from settling there.' « In a letter to LieutenaDt-Colonel Prideaux,t dated 17th October 1876, the News-agent at Bahrein also said that Sheikh Butye, the Chief Political A., Febrnarj 1877* N ob . 1 -88- . 0 f Qdeid, paid tribute to the Torks through Jassim bin Mahomed. The agent also said that the Turkish Government collects through Jassim about 9^000 Krans per annum from the Guttur coast, and that Jassim being much troubled by * Bedoos' besides being put to great expense, regrets having become a Governor on behalf of the Turks, and is anxious to become a British subject/' Plunder of a Bahrein boat at sea by Beni Hajirs and an excessive contribution levied by CMef of Eidaa on British Indian traders residing there- 1874-75. 32. With his letter, dated 12th September 1874, reporting certain aggres- _ ,,, . . -. , v 1fi(T , Q(e sive movements of the 3?eni Hajir tribe Political A., November 1874, J*os. 187-196. • i. t &gt; i • j . t ti ta * i r» • i , against Bahrein, the Political Resident forwarded a translation of a letter from the News-writer at Bahrein in which he stated that at Khor Shajeyj the Beni Hajir ' espied the mushwa of Abdul Karim' (a British subject) ({ of Bushire, now residing at Bahrein, and pursued and captured it, plundering therefrom 2,000 and odd dollars, the pro-11 perty of Jasim bin Thani^ and some dates and cloth belonging to Banyans' (Britisli subjects) and to people of Bahrein.^ 33. In October 1874 the Political Hesidenfc communicated a further report Political a .. Novemta 1874, Mo, 2 o3. ^ , : om ' le News-writer that Jasim bm Thani, the son or Mahomed bm Thani, Chief of Bidaa, had, with a view to recover his own money, imprisoned seven men of the Beni Hajir on account of the said plunder; and he, the Political [Resident, at the same time mentioned that he awaited further information as to the steps which the Bidaa Chief might take in the matter. 24i. The Political Resident, in June 1875, reported that owing to the Letter Nos. 623-162, dated 18th June 1875. Conduct of JaSllU, in harbouring the Political a , September 1875, Nos. 59-67- ^ Bedouins and conniving at their seizure of boats in the Bidaa district, he considered that a responsibility attached to the Bidaa Chief in the matter of the plunder under reference, but, owing to that Chief's position as regards the Turkish Government, it was obviously inadvisable to make a demand on him for satisfaction, as might have been done were his status different. He, however, addressed Mahomed bin Thani enquiring whether he proposed to cause restitution to be made to our subjects, and his reply showed that he to some degree accepted the responsibility. 85. The actual payment of the indemnification being deferred however, and as complaints were also received from the Banians residing at Bidaa of unjust exactions imposed by tbe Chief, the Political Resident directed Lieu tenant Fraser, his Second Assistant, who was proceeding to Bahrein on special duty, to visit Bidaa and enquire into the matter, as also to observe quietly, as far as possible, the present political condition of Bidaa. 36. Two reports were forwarded by Lieutenant Praser, one of which (Enclosure 3) showed that the Chief Mahomed bin Thani had paid the amount claimed as compensation for the boat plunder, and made restitution of the excessive exaction levied on Banians in his town. 37. The other report which describes the political situation at Bidaa is as follows :— ' There is a small force of Turkish Gendarmes, 50 in number, stationed here, and commanded by an officer named Jasim Agha, who is also a Kazi. ' Mahomed bin Tlmni, though now averse to, and desirous of freeing himself from, the thraldom of Turkish control, is afraid of exhibiting outward symptoms of disaffection, which would probably result in his removal to Constantinople and detention there for an indefinite period. &lt;( Jasim Agha, the Turkish officer, is consulted in all matters connected with the Chief's policy and administration, and nothing can be done without his concurrence. Such curtail ment of power is extremely irksome to Mahomed bin Thani, and also to his ambitious son, Jasim, who, however heartily he may have welcomed the advent of the Turks at first, would now as gladly rejoice at their departure. The Turkish flag is flown of course. The Turkish officer is said to get a deal of money out of the Arabs. A Turkish vessel is shortly expected here, and it is said will proceed to Bahrein, ' The number of the Beni Hajir in Bidaa amounts to some 2J30 fighting men, and their Chief's name is Salim bin Shafi. They appear to have settled down permanently, having their own houses and some engaging in the pearl fishery. Besides these, there are some 300 of the same tribe encamped in the vicinity under the command of Mahomed bin Shafi. The object of retaining so many warriors of this tribe at great expense (for they require both money and food), is to enable the Guttur Chief to some day strike a blow at Bahrein and Zobarah.'- 38. Colonel Ross also forwarded, together with a petition from British Indian traders at Bidaa, in which they expressed a wish to leave the place, a translation of the letter from the Bidaa Chief explaining, with regard to the exaction complained of by the Banians, that he took from them a sum of money for the purpose of protecting them and their property from robb&amp;rs to prevent injury. He said that he levied contributions from all, and added thereto and observed—12 u In future, i£ tlie Banians consent to pay what I levy from my own eubjects, I eliall be happy to keep and protect them, else I cannot spend my own money to protect the Banians from the Bedouins and others/' 88-A. Colonel Ross observed (paragraph 10) that it appeared to him, from the action and correspondence of Mahomed bin Thani, that he was sincerely anxi ous to remain on friendly terms, the proceedings of his son, Jasim, however and his relations with the Turks, made his course difficult to steer, and he (Colonel Ross) thought that Government would wish him, whilst avoiding any appearance of interference with any matters in which British interests were not directly concerned, to continue, as occasion required, to correspond in a friendly manner with Mahomed bin Thani on matters such as the in terests of British Indian traders and so forth. As he seemed to be conceded the position of, at least, nominal administrator or Governor of the district, the Political Resident did not think there could be objections raised to this course in any quarter. 39. As regards the Banians residing at Bidaa, Colonel Ross considered Mahomed bin Thani's view was reasonable and just: there w^as no reason, he said, why the traders should be exempted from the same local dues as levied on other inhabitants of Bidaa, but without doubting the sincerity of Mahomed bin Thani's promises, he feared that the traders might occasionally suffer annoyances at the hands of Jasim bin Thani, or perhaps the local Turkish officers, and possibly it might become advisable for them to remove. He proposed informing them of Mahomed bin Thani's proposals and promises, and recommending them to reconsider their request to be removed, and should they decide on leaving Bidaa, he would desire them to fix a period for the winding up of their affairs, at the expiry of which a vessel would be sent for them. t Letter No. 2457-?., dated 7th September 1875. ^ 11 * S re P or t 0^ the Political Resident, the Government of India ob served ' The Governor-General in Council fully approves the action taken by you, which resulted Political A., September 1875, No. 67. ^ P a y me nt of compensation to the British Indian subjects residing at Bahrein for losses sustained in the plunder of a Bahrein boat by the Beni Hajir. His Excellency in Council notices with satisfaction the readiness with which the ChieE of El-Bidaa complied with the representations made to him in this matter, and in the matter of the excessive contribution levied from the Banyans. ' On the subject of future correspondence with the Chief of El Bidaa, the Governor- General in Council approves of the views stated in paragraph 10 of your letter, viz., that whilst avoiding any appearance of interference with any matters in which British interests are not directly concerned, you should continue, as occasion may require, to correspond in a friendly manner with Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani on matters such as the interests of the British Indian traders and the like. ' With reference to your proposed communication to the Banians at Ei Bidaa regarding the proposals and promises of Mahomed bin Thani, His Excellency in Council does not consider that it is incumbent on the Government of India to advise the traders whether to leave or to remain at El Bidaa. If they remain there, they must conform to local laws and taxation, and they should simply be informed that they must_decide for themselves on the question of remaining or leaving the place.' Claims preferred by Governor of Basrah on behalf of inhabitants of Katar against certain residents of Bahrein. 1875-1876. 41. Two claims were preferred by Nasir Pasha on the part of Sheikh Political a., January 1876, Nog. 61-70. Mahomed bin Said and Sheikh Khamis bin J umal Abu Kowareh, stated to be two respectable merchants of Katar, against certain persons said to have settled in Bahrein. The claims originated in connection with the pearl fisheries and according to the ordinary mode of procedure would have been referred for adjustment to a Salifah' or Court of pearl merchants. The importance of the case consisted in the fact that Colonel Ross suspected that the real object of Nasir Pasha in taking it up was a desire to interfere with the affairs of Bahrein, in the hope of committing the Turkish Government to his policy. On this account Colonel Ross suggested that in the event of further pressure being brought to bear on the Chief of-c. 13 Bahrein, fit might be adviaaWe to refer the] matter to the arbitration of the British Government, at the same time he wrote to Sheikh Esan advising him to settle the matter in a friendly and courteous manner, and recom mending him not to permit his territories to be used as a place of refuge by dishonest persons. This advice was approved of by the Government of India, „. T iQfra xf who wrote as follows to Colonel Boss Pohtioal A., January 1876, No. 68. /1VT c\c)a ti i i. i nrti.! t (No. 282-P., dated 27th January 1876) : ' You are directed to confine yonrself to offering friendly advice and to urging 1 the Chief to effect in a fair and honest spirit a settlement of the claims in question. If, however, Nasir Pasha should not be satisfied with the proceedings of the Chief in this matter, and should attempt to enforce his demands by menaces or a display of force, you may justly, under the spirit of Article 3 of the Treaty with the Chief of Bahrein dated May 1861^ inter vene with a view of protecting the territory of Bahrein from maritime aggression.' The case was reported to the Home Government, for the information of the Secretary of State, and the London Foreign Office instructed Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople to call the attention of the Porte to the subject. Alleged ill-treatment of British Indian subjects. 1876. 42. A few months afterwards, Jasim bin Mahomed was appointed Kaim Makam, or Deputy to the Governor of Hasa. This latter, a certain Mazayyad, was a son of Nasir Pasha, the Governor of Basrah. One of the first steps taken by Jasim on accession to his new office, was to summon two of the Hindu traders, Rama and Cheyla, to Hasa. The ostensible reason for this proceeding was that the men were wanted for examination, but in reality Colonel Ross considered it to be an act of retaliation on the part of Jasim for the indemnity he had been compelled to pay for the exactions he had levied from those very men. Mahomed bin Thani, father of Jasim and actual Chief of Bidaa, seems to have behaved rather well in the matter, by endeavouring to protect the Banians, but he was powerless to counteract the increasing influence and authority of the Turks whose protege Jasim had declared him self to be, and thus acquired the means of carrying things with a very high band. Mahomed bin Thani made this a pretext for soliciting the aid of the British Government in recovering his independence, but as any interference in the affairs of the mainland would have been distinctly against the policy of the Government, his wishes in this matter were not acceded to. The treat ment of the traders, was, however, thought a gross outrage upon two British No. 28, dated 4t,h February 1876. Indian subjects, ,, and accordingly the political a, March 1876, No. 2C6.

The Political Resident further intimated, as regards Zobarah, that ' Governor, Basrah, ordered Katif authorities to send Turkish gunboat to Zobarah to warn Bidaa people against attacking Bahrein.' Colonel Ross suggested that the best way to preserve the peace in future would be the establishment of a Turkish Post at Zobarah or in its immediate vicinity, and he reported that the Chief of Bahrein had expressed his acquis- cence in the arrangement. No orders appear to have been passed on the pro posal, and the town remained in ruins until 1888, when the Turkish Government proposed to rebuild it.Ill-treatment of Indian traders—1879. 44. In January 1879, Colonel Ross reported that a Banian named iPoiiticai a, March 1879, Nos. 186-193. Fursu was beaten and ill-treated by the Turkish Governor of Bidaa, on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. The alleged fault of the Banian was that of exporting dates from Katar, but one of the witnesses said that no notice of the prohibition to export dates had been made public. On a report being made to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, by the Native Agent at Bahrein, Colonel Ross sent copies of the papers to the Political Agent at Bagdad, and suggested that the Turkish authorities should be requested to make immediate enquiries into the matter. Colonel Boss also pointed out that no redress had been obtained in the case of ill-treatment of Hindu traders at Bidaa which happened in 1875. 45. In his covering letter to this Government, Colonel Ross observed that incidents of this kind were so prejudicial to the prestige of the British Government in and around the Persian Gulf, that he thought it would be best to take steps for the removal of the British Indians from Bidaa. The Govern ment of India thought it more to the point, however, if the offendino- Turkish Governor Mahomed Agha be removed, should the alleged all-treatment be proved against him, and to this end the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia was addressed and instructed to press the case on the Governor-General of Turkish Arabia. To withdraw all British subjects, they were of opinion, would not be likely to increase British prestige. * political a., march 1879, nos. 186 m. The case was also reported to the 7th March 1878).

On the 11th March 1871, Colonel Pelly, then British Eesident at Political a, March 1872, No. 369. -ousliire, addressed the Bombay Govern- some months previously by the ChMot AbuthVbfrigtrding tlTrecent sStl 116 ment at Odeid m his territories.

Furtbe^/ tC Ve^eS to^hemaintenance of the settlement would sooner or Jater lead to collision by sea. Colonel Pelly having warned the Ahutliabi Chief to abstain from action by sea, proceeded to institute further enquiries on his own account. The information he collected showed that Odeid belonged to Abuthabi, and that the Katar Chief, whose territories were on one side conterminous with the district of Odeid, ignored all connection with it. Under these circumstances, he wrote to the settlers at Odeid, cautioning them to conform to the rule of the Chief of Abuthabi within whose territories they had taken up their abode. political a, march 1872, no. 373. On the 31st July, Colonel Pelly Nos. 247 -252, dated nth March 1871. wrote again, enclosing a report received No. 26 of 2iit Jul/i87i. from Major Smith on his return from Odeid. Since the date of his previous letter, Colonel Pelly had taken every opportu nity to advise a peaceful adjustment between the Chief of Abuthabi and the colonists at Odeid. Hitherto his efforts had been successful. But the case now appeared liable to complication from the presence of a Turkish force on the coast. The position taken up by the Chief, which Colonel Pelly held to be reasonable and iu accord with the facts, was briefly this :—That Odeid belonged to him; that it had now been colonised by certain Arabs, who owed him allegiance; that in conformity with the terms of the maritime truce he bad referred the case to the British Resident; and that having thus fulfilled his trucial obligations, he claimed the right to move along his coastline and coerce the colonists unless they submitted to his rule. 52. The Odeid colonists, however, contended that Odeid did not belong to Abuthabi; they were desirous of living as an independent society under the trucial flag ; and they had been offered, but had as yet declined, the protection of the Turkish flag, The supposition was that, if Abuthabi now attempted coercion, they would accept the Turkish flag, and so further complicate matters, not only at Odeid, but at other points on the Arab littoral. For instance, while on the one side a Chief willing to accept that flag for temporary • At the time tbe Tnrks were operating against PUrpOSBS might avgUB that the Turkish Nejd, and had brought troopa by sea from Busrah expedition* was Operating by land, and t0 Lahsa • was therefore apart from the sphere of British policy and action ; on the other side, a Chief injured or aggrieved by such acceptance of Turkish protection might argue that the Turkish expedition reached the Arabian coast by sea, and could not, except by means of such movement by sea, have placed itself in a position to foster dissensions among, or coerce, the littoral tribes. Under these circumstances. Colonel Pelly asked for instructions as to the course to be pursued in dealing with tbe quarrel between the Chief of Abuthabi and the Odeid colonists. 53. Prom Major Smith's report it appeared that that officer had person- political a, m.r c h m»,h. 374. »}ly diseussed the situation with Sheikh No. 25, dated 20th July 1871, with accompani. Buttye-bin-Khadim, the; head of the m8nt, • El Kabizat at Odeid. He not only abso lutely refused to submit to Abuthabi, but stated that his people were in their own right at Odeid, and independent. The territorial limits of the colony were declared to extend from Ras-ul-Hala, midway to Wukra in Katar, continu ously along the southern coast through Odeid to a point abreast of the island of Seir Beni-Yas. He further claimed the island of Dalma and other islets within that circuit,hitherto unquestionably belonging to Abuthabi. He assented that this territory constituted the ancient home of the Kabizat, which they would maintain against Abuthabi, who was not their Chief; that in short he, Sheikh Buttye, was the real Chief of the district; he would do everything that the Resident desired, and not think of breaking the peace at sea; in fact, he was so poor, as might be seen, that he had no power to do so,; and as he had received a trucial flag, which he always hoisted at sea, he only looked to the British.16 He then admitted he had been offered the Turkish flag hy the Katar Chief, but had refused it, saying he was under British protection. This, however, was clearly put forward in hopes of gaining his point in regard to casting off allegiance to Abuthabi. If his claims to independence were not recognized by the Residency, there could be little doubt as to the course ha would take. 5k On 1st October, Colonel Pelly wrote again, enclosing a translated purport of a letter received from the Chief of Abjithabi, urgently desiring an intimation of the views of the British Government on the Odeid question. Colonel Pelly feared that the matter would now be complicated by the presence of the Turkish flag in the Gulf. Rumours or reports had, on more than one occasion, reached him to the effect that the colonists at Odeid hoisted the Turkish flag on Fridays. These reports might not altogether be reliable, but they showed that the notion of claiming Turkish protection had been entertained. 55. At first no orders were passed, but the Bombay Government (No. v 2584, dated 2nd May 1872) having, in r- A ; 0 ' 68 iK7!j consequence of a further letter from No. 1250, dated 29th February 1872. i i -r» n ^ ±4- .u 2^4 2nd Mav Colonel Pelly, pressed the matter, the Government of India issued the following instructions :— In acknowledging receipt o£ your letters marginally noted, relative to the di?pnte be tween the Chief of Abuthabi and the colonists at Odeid, 1 am directed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to intimate that as no attack has been made upon the Abuthabi Chief by sea, it does not appear that any action on the part of the Resident under the maritime truce is called ftr. It will be unnecessary for Colonel Pelly to interfere unless he apprehends a breach of the peace at sea between the parties, but he should report at once if there is any ovevt action indicating the intention of the Turks to establish their supremacy at Odeid. 56. In explanation of these orders, it may be noted that Colonel Pelly, in his further letter above referred to, bad pointed out that the Chief of Abuthabi was one of the Trucial Chiefs and had brought the Odeid dispute to his (Colonel Pelly's) notice in virtue of the position of arbitrator occupied by the Resident in the Persian Gulf under the trucial agreement. 57. Here the matter rested until the 7th August 1873, when Colonel Ross, who had succeeded Colorel Pelly as Resident in the Persian Gulf, forwarded a letter, dated 20th June 1873, from the Chief of Abuthabi, on the subject of the settlers at Odeid. Colonel Ross explained that the chief desired to attack the inhabitants of Odeid by sea, as on account of the numerous u , T „ , creeks a land expedition was impractica- Political A.. November 1873, J,o.. 97 and 9S. ^ ^ consi( J ered himself bound by his trucial engagements to consult the Resident, and obtain his previous sanc tion. The letter from the Chief merely begged that what was necessary might be done. Colonel Ross asked for instuctions as to the reply which he should send. 58. Subsequently, in a report, dated Political A., Korerrber 1878, No. 101. 20tb August 1873, Colonel KoSS Wrote as follows It is almost certain that in the present position of affairs the Turks would not send a expedition against Abuthabi, or any other Oman seaport. If any despatch of troops in that direction be contemplated, it will doubtless be under cover of an invitation from the Arabs themselves, and it may te worth while to consider whether there is any likelihood of such an invitation being given. I consider that the present condition of the affairs of the Abuthabi Chief might lead to Turkish intervention in one of three eventualities:— Firstly. —The Arab settlers of El-Qdeid might seek Turkish protection against the Chief of Abuthabi should the latter attempt to coerce them. Secondly. —The Chief of Abuthabi might ask aid of Turkish troops or vessels to coerce Odeid.17 Thirdly .—The Chief of Abuthabi might be inducdd to invite Tuikish intervention in the affairs of Oman. I am disiaolined to think this Chief would be so reckless, but the Oman Arabs are noto riously sh irt-sighted, and will ofLen sacrifice much for momentary gratification. Sheikh Zaid-bin Khalifa cherishes the most bitter hatred against Debai on one side. On the other side, he is discontented about the forts of Bereymee. I d former times Sheikh Zaid exercised muoh influence over a branch of the Naeem tribe which now holds Bereymee. He was in the habit of visiting that place yearly and residing in the fort, but latterly he has been excluded. It is not to bft overlooked, therefore, that an understanding between Sheikh Zaid and the Turks, wiih the object of placing Bereymee in the hands of the latter, might have attractions for both sides. In Ssptember of last year, the Chief of Abuthabi, when on a visit to Muscat, informed me he had a letter from some Turkish authority, which he viewed as an invitation to recognize the siipremucy of the Ottoman Government. A report of this was made and f awarded to the Government of Bombay by the Resident with his letter No. 1618-44.5 dated 5th October 1872. Sheikh Zaid afterwards, I recollect, personally Consulted Colonel Pelly as to what reply he should seud to the said letter. There is no doubt, I think, that the Turkish Arabian authorities consider b th Abuthabi and Bereymee as portions of the province of Nejd, and that they would gladly seize any favourable opportunity of possessing themsalves of, especially the latter place. 59. In reply* the Government of India referred Colonel Ross to the poi ti.iii a , no.ember i67s, no. 108. instructions which have been already quoted m. parasrraph 6 of this note. • Foreiira Departmant No. 2760-P., dated 27 tb rnr.^— rl +1 ^ j i October 1873. Ihey added that no answer need be given to the Chief unless he pressed for one. la this event he was to be told that not only would the Government of India give no countenance to any expedition on his part by sea, but that they would take active measures to prevent it. 60. In September 1873 Colonel Ross forwarded a letter from his Assistant, political a,, November 1873, No. loi. Major Grant, reporting information acquir ed on the Oman coast concerning the alleged design of the Turkish authorities to extend their influence to Oman. Translations of letters to the Chiefsf of Debai and Abuthabi from a Turkish t Both Truci.i ciuefa. °® &lt;:er named Yusuff Effendi, and of a letter to Colonel Ross from Sheikh Zaid-bin Khalifa of Abuthabi were attached. Colonel Ross wrote : It appears from the correspondence that the Turkish authorities of Nejd are endeavour ing to establish a friendly understanding with the Trucial Chiefs of 6m m, for political or commercial purposes. According to the wording of Ynsuff Effendi's letter, the latter object is in view ; but at the same time I understand the words used to inquire after rates and * news ' taken in conjunction, may refer to the state of affairs of popular feeling. It will be observed the Chiefs of Debai and Abuthabi disclaim any wish to enter into relations with the Turkish authorities, and I feel sure none of them would at present trust themselves in the hands of the Turks. I do not feel sure that the Chief of Abuthabi does not know more about this Turkish correspondence than he pretends. Expressions in Yusuff Effendi's letter to him might lead one to think previous letters had passed, and it is somewhat significant that the Turkish officer should wish this Chief to write letters to the others. Whilst these letters do not themselves prove any intention of the Turks to interfere politically in Oman, yet coupled with the generally received reports, I think there is ground to view their operations in that quarter with vigilant distrust. Tt is for Government to decide whether it would be advisable to obtain from the Turkish Government an explanation of the proceedings. 61. In November 1874i, Colonel Ross reported that occasion had arisen for Political a., december 1s74, No. 148. taking action in accordance with the it « ^ • p a k v .,10 instructions of the 27th October 1873.

J-lie Oliiei of Abuthabi had again referred to his wish to coerce the Odeid settlers by sea, and had been told that the Government of India could not permit such a proceeding. Sheikh Zaid then observed that the Turkish Government claimed Odeid as under their protection, and that Turkish local oflicials had written to him to that effect. He professed to have mislaid their letters18 but promised to forward them when found. It seemed to Colonel Ross probable that the Sheikh of Odeid, feariag aa attack from Abuthabi, might have had recourse to the Turkish authorities, and that the letters referred to by the Chief of Abuthabi might have been the result. 62. The Government of India approved Colonel Ross' proceedings, and decided to await a further report in regard to the written . of Protec tion alleged to have been made by the Turks to the Sheikh of Odeid. 63. On 20th March 1875, Colonel Ross recurred to the subject of these letters to the Chief of Abuthabi. Zaid Political a ., May 1876, No. 844. declared that he could not find the letters ; their purport, however, was that be should abstain from interference with Odeid. Colonel Ross also sent translations of letters which had^ passed between the Sheikh of Odeid and himself, on the subject of the Sheikh s apprehensions of being attacked by Abuthabi. It appeared that the Sheikh possessed both a Turkish flag and the Arab Trucial flag. History of Odoid 1870—1878. and that he used the one or the other as occasion required. 6i. In 1873-77, various piracies were perpetrated from Odeid territory. To Secretary of .tate. No. 78 p., dated loth Maj and the tribe of Boni Hajir were at first 1877, (political a , may 1877, no. soi}. supposed to have been the offenders. In the course of inquiring into these outrages, it was ascertained by Captain Guthrie, of the May JPrere, that the Sheikh of Odeid paid an annual tribute to the amount of 40 or 50 dollars to the Turks through the chief of El Bidaa. Nevertheless, during the whole of Captain Guthrie's visit the Sheikh continued to fly the Arab Trucial flag and not the Turkish flag. Two or three years pre viously four Turks had come to Odeid by steamer and settled terms, but had never remained there any time. 65. Subsequently, it appeared that the piracies under investigation had been perpetrated by the Al Morra, and not by the Beni Haiir ; that the Sheikh of Odeid was not implicated, but that he was too weak to prevent his ports being made use of. Captain Prideaux, who was then acting as Resident in Colonel Ross' absence, wrote :— ,f Althouffli the previous accounts of these outrages were exagorerated, there is sufficient evidence to show that since the relaxation of British vigilance upon the Guttur (El-Katarj coast, consequent on the assumption of authority in that quarter by the Porte, the wild and lawless tribes of the mainland have more frequent opportunities than formerly of indulging their pira tical propensities. I do not tbink the Chief of Odeid can justly be held accountable for these specific acts of violence ; but it is quite clear that he is unable to restrain the Bedouin tribes who find in his ports a convenient shelter from reprisals and punishment. The Agent on the Arab Coast, whom 1 have summoned to Bashire, will endeavour to effect a reconciliation be tween the Chief of Abuthabi and Odeid ; but if his efforts should prove unsuccessful, it might be worthy of consideration whether the authority of the British Government should not be exercised in restoring the former Chiet to his leifiliimate position at Odeid, and coercing, if necessary, the seceders from his tribe. No acts of piracy are ever reported from the districts rulnd by the Chiefs under treaty obligations to us ; and it seems anomalous that the civilizing policy of Government should be neutralized by an even 1 : which, as I have shown in my memo- Accompaniment to letter No. 211, dated 16th randu'n on Odeid, is not a novel occurrence. Al- September 1876. ' though the Chief is said to have a Turkish flag in his possession, it would be scarcely probable that the Porte would advance any pretensions to Odeid, which, until the last few years, was indisputably an integral portion of Abuthabi territory/' ' The Government of India concurred in this view, and empowered the Resident to use his beet endeavours to promote a reunion between thecolo- Poreign Department No. 974 P., dated yth May nists at Odeid and the main body of the Beni- Yas tribe of Abuthabi,and further authorized him ' to afford assistance, if necessary, to the Trucial Chief of Abuthabi in coercing the seceders.' ^ .w, ^ ™ I n reporting the papers to the Despatch No. 78 P., dated 10th May 1877. 0 ^ ^ Secretary of State, the Government of India wrote as follows : — ' * 3. From the present letter from the Officiating Political Resident, and from the pre vious correspondence on the subject, the following facts appear to be established ''(1.) That the acts of piracy complained of were committed by members of the Al Morra tribe, a tribe nominally dependent on the Turkish Government. ' ' (2 ) That the pirates proceeded on their expedition from ports belonging to the Chief of Odeid.' ' (3.) That the Chief of O leid iu no way countenanced or assisted the use of his ports as a starting place for piratical expeditions. ' ' (4&lt;) That thfl reason why the Chief of Odeid is weak, is that he and his followers are a small colony of discontents who have seceded from the main body of the great Beni-Yas tribe of Abuthabi. ' ' (5) That the reason why the Chief of the Beni-Yas tribe has not brought his refractory colonists into order is, that he has been prevented, from so doing by the British Gov ernment.' 3. Under the circumstances above set forth it appears desirable that— ' ' (1) Endeavour be made to induce the Turkish Government to take measures to restrain the piratical proceedings of the A1 Morra tribe ; and et ' (2) That measures be taken by ourselves to prevent the ports of Odeid being used as a rendezvous for pirates/ ' 4. In regard to the action proposed to be taken through the Turkish Government, we have to solicit the assistance of Your Lordship and of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; in regard to the ports of Odeid it is clearly to the interest of the British Government, as g lardian of the peace and protector against outrage in the Persian Gulf, that each of thetrucial tribes of the littoral should be strong and undivided ; while it appears but equitable that the Government which prohibits the Chief of Abuthabi from bringing his refractory tribesmen into order should secure him their submission and allegiance, either by peaceful, or, if need be, by cofrcive measures. We have therefore, in our letter No 974 P., datpd 7th May 1877, to the Resident of the Persian Gulf, empowered that officer to use his best endeavours to promote a reunion between the colonists at Odeid and the main body of the Beni-Yas tribe, and have further authorized him to afford assistance, if necessary, to the Trucial Chief of Abuthabi in coercing the seceders. We trust that the above instructions will meet with the approval of Her Majesty's Government. ' It has been mentioned as a possible source of difficulty in procuring the submission of the colonists of Odeid, that their Chief, who has been in communication with the Turkish Gov ernment at A1 Hasa, may at the last moment hoist the Turkish flag. But seeing that the British Government has received no official intimation on the subject, and that there is no tangible evidence that the Chief of Odeid is under the effective suzerainty of the Turkish Government, No. 62, dated 4th October 1877 (Political A, we apprehend that the mere hoisting of the Tur- February i878, Nos 263-269). kisli flag need in no way restrict the freedom of our action in the matter. 67. Upon receipt of these papers, the Secretary of State entered into cor- respoadenoe with the Poreiga Office and advised that the English Ambassador at Constantinople should be directed to call the serious attention of the Turkish Government to the increase of piraey along the Katar coast, which had re sulted from the extension of Turkish authority in that quarter; and that he should intimate the resolve of Her Majesty's Government not to permit the peace of the Persian Gulf to be disturbed by expeditions proceeding either from ports like Bidaa in actual Turkish possession, or organized by tribes recogniz ing Turkish supremacy, and despatched from the territories of independent Chiefs, too weak to prevent the abuse of their ports. He further advised that no reference should be made to Odeid, because it was doubtful whether the Turkish Government exercised any substantial authority over the Chief of that place, and it was inexpedient to provoke a discussion on the point. The result of Mr. Layard's remonstrance was that the Turkish Government denied all knowledge of any piratical outrages on the Katar coast, and asked for particulars. In reply, the India Office referred Lord Derby to Captain Prideaux's letters of Augut 1876 and February 1877, and suggested that these should be furnished to Mr. Layard for the information of the Turkish authorities. In sending this correspondence for the information of the Government of India, the Secretary of State intimated * the approval of Her Majesty's Government of the instructions issued to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, under date 7th May 1877, with a view to prevent the port of Odeid being used as a shelter for pirates.' 68. In June 1877, the Resident described the measures taken in pursuance of the instructions,* dated 7th May 1877, f * No 1878 d N ted 25 1 5 5th June 1877 (Political A ' cited in paragraph 10 of this note, and a + From Resident, No. 159, dated 2ist Jun6 1877 few days later he reported the details of (Political a , February 1578, No. 257). an outrage by sea committed by Odeid t For details see notes recorded m K.

At the same time he wrote to the Abuthabi Chief informing him that the Government of India had determined that Odeid should again submit to his authority and was willing to support his efforts to effect that object. It was desirable that the end in view should be obtained by peaceful means : but if Sheikh Buttye refused to listen to advice, further steps might be necessary. Meanwhile the Chief of Abuthabi was to do nothing without previously con sulting the Bridsh Agent at Shargah; but he might rest assured that in a short time his authority would be fully re-established at Odeid. In the Wukra affair the Resident ordered the Odeid Chief to release forthwith the persona captured, and warned him that further notice would probably be taken of his conduct. The Government of India decided to await a further report showing the course pursued by the Chief of Odeid PoVeign Department No. 2063*P , dated 22nd jvy the Wukrfl mattev bllf DflsmPfl no nvrlprR Auguit 1877 (Political A.

Upon this the Resident was authorized—on the assumption that he had satisfied himself that the Chief of Odeid had violated the 4 Maritime Truce '—in the event of the Chief's final reply being unsatisfactory, to send a British man- of-war to exact reparation by force. These orders referred only to the Wukra case. But while no further action was taken or intended to be taken in respect to Abuthabi, the instructions of May 1877 remained uncancelled. 70. On the 12th December Colonel Ross, who had now resumed his appoint ment of Resident in the Persian Gulf, telegraphed that his attempts to reconcile Abuthabi and Odeid had failed, as the Odeid Chief relied on Turkey. He asked for an Indian Government vessel in preference to a vessel of the Royal Navy. After some correspondence he was directed to apply to the Senior Naval Olticer for a vessel of the latter class, and the leazer was placed at his disposal. Nothing more was heard from Colonel Ross until the Secretary of State's despatch of July 1878 drew attention to the occurrences at Odeid. It then appeared that Colonel Ross had written No. 282, dated 15th December 1877. 4. ^ i xj. *4. j • xi • *j_i No. 65, dated 6th April 1878. the ^o letters cited m the margin, neither of which had been received. The first of these explained Colonel Ross' telegraphic application for an Indian Government vessel. It also enclosed letters from the Chiefs ol' Abuthabi and Odeid. The former acknowledged Captain Prideaux's warning that he was not to act with out consulting the British Agent at Shargab. The latter declared himself to be * connected with the Ottoman Government, from which we shall never deviate, nor can there be any alteration in our allegiance.* 70-A. The second letter contains an account of the proceedings against Odeid. The important point is that the Chief of Abuthabi had formally recognized his responsibility for the prevention of piratical expeditions from this part of the coast. 71. In replying to Foreign Department lerter No. 255 C.P., dated 17th December, on the general question of Turkish jurisdiction. Colonel Ross took up specially the position of Odeid, and brought under consideration the following points :— ' Firstly. —Whether Turkish authority has ever been actually exercised or established at Odeid. Secondly. —Whether by conquest of Al-Hasa, or by occupation of El-Katar, just claim has been established. . v Thirdly, —Whether the wish of the inhabitants can be deemed to establish a claim.' * On the first point he reports that no overt action indicatinsr the intention of the Turks to establish their supremacy at Odeid has hitherto been taken, and that no authority or jurisdic tion has, as far as known, been ever established or exercised. On the second point, he refers to Colonel Pelly^s correspondence with the Chiefs in question, which has been noticed in para graphs 4 to 6 of this note, and refers to the enquiry made in 1871, in whi^h it was ascertained that 1 Odeid forms no portion of Guttur (El-Katar) territory/ Upon the third point he writes as follows ;— j The third point suggested for consideration is as to the bearinsr on the qu3stion of juri«- diotiou of the action of the Odeid people themselves. The desire of the Sheikh of Odeid hasall along been to be treated as an independent Chief, and admitted as swch into tbe circle of Trueial Chiefs under British protection. This privilege could not, however, be conceded with out setting aside the asserted right of the Abuthabi Chief over Odeid and its inhabitanti. The latter being the hereditary tribesmen and subjects of Abuthabi, their complete independence could not be recognized. Under the circumstances, and considering tbe geographical position of the place, it does not appear to me that the Turkish Government would have the right to accept the allegiance of aliens residing beyond their frontier, nor do I see how such a tender, assuming it made, could confer right of jurisdiction in this instance. In addition to the considerations of a negative description which I have touched on, the positive claims of the Chiefs of Abuthabi in regard to Odeid must be considered. For more than a generation the Chiefs ot Abuthabi have claimed, and occasionally exercised, authority over the place and inhabitants, who according to Arab ideas and custom were the dependents of the said Chiefs. The rights of the latter seem to have always been recognized by the British officers in the Gulf, and the same view has, after many years of occasional correspond ence, been practically approved by Government. It is probable that the Turkish pretensions lately put forward, at the instance of the local Txde No. 974 P., dated 7th May 18/7. Sheikhs, are based on ignorance of facts. I as certained last year that the Governor of Busrah had never even heard the name of Odeid. As a matter of right, it appears to me plain that the Turkish Government has no valid claim to Odeid. Viewed as a question of policy, apart from the rights of Abuthabi, I consider it would be prejudicial to British interests and influence in the Gulf to suffer Turkish rule to extend to Odeid. The place would probably once more become a resort of pirates, for whose purposes it is admirably adapted, and some of whom have, since the abandonment of the village, transferred their base of operations to the vicinity of Katif. Further claims and pretensions would ensue, extending probably to the adjacent islands, which might be regarded as pertaining to Odeid, and disorders would multiply in those intricate waters which we should be debarred from repressing, and which the Turkish local agents and proteges would regard with indifference/ 72. Despatch No. 29-S., dated 11th July 1878 from the Secretary of State for India called for a report from the Gov- 1878 ' ernment of India in regard to the pro ceedings of the Resident at Bushire, Captain Wodehouse of the Teazer, and Zaid-bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abuthabi towards Odeid, a village of the Katar Coast. Sir A. Layard, His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, writing on the 28th May, reported that Sadyk Pasha, the Ottoman Minister for Foreign affairs, had read to him a telegram from the Wali of Basrah, complaining that Zaid-bin-Kbalifa, with 70 boats and accompanied by an English war steamer and the British Consul at Bushire, had attacked Odeid, which be described as a dependency of the Turkish district of Castar (Katar). The inhabitants having fled, the village was pillaged and destroyed, and all the boats carried off. The Porte hoped that some explanation would be afforded of this descent upon Turkish territory. Lord Cranbrook, to whom the papers were referred, declined to give any detailed expression of opinion until he had consulted the Govern ment of India, but in the meantime he drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the correspondence of 1877, in which the India Office recommended that a discussion with the Forte in regard to the status of Odeid should^ if possible, be avoided. The reason why the Government of India had been as yet unable to inform the Secretary of State of their views on this matter, was that Colonel Boss' original report of the proceedings at Odeid miscarried, and by the time a duplicate had been obtained, the other despatches from the Secretary of State, were received. These raised the larger question of Turkish jurisdiction over the entire Arab littoral, and necessitated further enquiries from the local officers. (1; History of Odeid continued- (2) Questions of Turkish jurisdiction on Aatar coast and suppression of piracies 1878—1881. 73. In replying to the Secretary of State's despatch No. 29, dated the 11th July 1878, the conclusion arrived at by Government of India in their despatch No. 127, dated 22nd May 1879 was :— u That Odeid belongs to the Chief of Abuthabi, with whom the British Government hag maintained direct treaty relations for many ypars, and that the pretensions of Turkey to claim the settlement as a dependency of a Turkish district, are vague and without foundation. It may be true that Sheikh Buttye of Odeid has occasionally hoisted the Turkish flag, that he has claimed Turkish protection, and that he has latterly paid a small tribute to Bidaa. But the existence of a separate and independent chiefship at Odeid has never been recognized, and the act of Sheikh Buttye in establishing a settlement there was an infraction of the prescriptive territorial rights of Abuthabi, The declaration of the Odeid Sheikh and of his coloney, that22 they put themselves under Turkish protection would not in any way, of itself, justify the Turks in asserting their jurisdiction over the place. 1£ such a plea were admitted^ it would.be set up by every petty chief along the coast, who might have good reasons for desiring to evade control or chastisement.' 74. This despatch of the Government of India dealt with several other points as regards the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf. The main question being the line of demarcation of the Turkish sphere of territorial jurisdiction on that coast and the nature of the responsibility for order which should be held to devolve on the two Governments. On these points the Government of India recommended that from Basrah to Ojair the authority of the Forte should he recognized as established on land, but at sea the British Government should continue to exercise some concurrent protectorate pursuing pirates if necessary into Turkish waters and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits through the Resident in the Gulf ; that south or east of Ojair, Turkish authority should not be recognized except at Bidaa on the Katar Peninsula; and that the Porte should be required {a) to stipulate not to interfere, either on the coast or in the islands uith the Trucial chiefs between Odeid and Ras ul-Khima, (6) to recognize the territories of the Sheikh of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain; and ((?) in case of piracies from within its jurisdiction, to enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of compensation. 75. There passed upon this despatch correspondence between the India 1880. an ^ foreign offices which was forwarded Pol. a. May 1880, No. is, sir Mullet 's letter, dated to the Government of India with Secretarv 27th September 1880. of No&gt; ^ dated ^ ember 18S0. The view to which the Secretary of State for India (Lord Cranbrook) was inclined was :— &lt;f The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it is to be defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at any point north of Ojair, which is opposite the southern extremity of the island of Bahrein; but it is precisely between that spot and Katif that since the settlement of the 13eni Yas at Odeid was broken up in 1878, the operations of the piratical tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity. Upon this point Lord Cranbrook would invite Lord Salisbury's attention to Colonel Ross' letter of the 8th May, enclosed in Government of India despatch No. 91 of the 28th July last, which was communicated to the Foreign Office on the 6th instant. His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognizing any particular part of th e Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish, and as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piractical craft is concerned, would he the formation of an asylum which would he taken advantage of by marauders in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would he unable to control without a considerable and permanent increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, which the Porte has declared itself precluded front making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on political grounds. « The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cranbrook is led is that negotiation or discussion with the Porte on the territorial question should be avoided', but that, in order that the oblio-a- tions contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce may be efficiently fulfilled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretentions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recogni tion of Ottoman supremacy by individual Chiefs, such as the Sheikh of Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points: 1 presence 76. In continuation of his despatch No. 40, dated 6th November 1879 re- Pol. a, may isso, No. 87. ferred to above, the Secretary of State in his despatch No. 4 (Secret) of 29th Janu ary 1880 forwarded further correspondence on the subject between the India and Foreign Offices. In a confidential communication regarding these papers, His Majesty's Ambassador (Sir H. Layard) was instructed by the Foreign Office, London, that wherever Turkish authority was at that time actually and firmly established upon the coast, His Majesty's Government would be ready to recognize it and would be glad to see it accompanied by a regular and civilized administration. He was also directed to press upon the Porte the advisability of allowing British ships—while pursuing their operations against piratical vessels outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north23 of Odeid—to pursue and capture them within the three mile limit of that part of the coa%t. Further as regards Maskat, Bahrein, and the possessions of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and Ras-el-Khyma inclusive, Her Majesty's Government, while they considered it unnecessary to seek for any formal declaration from the Porte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those two territories, were in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of these claims, and considered themselves hound hy their treaty engagements with their several Chiefs to resist any attempt, whether direct or indirect) to give them practical effect. 76-A. In July 1880 Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople (Mr. Goschen) issued a note to the Governor-General at Baghdad drawing his attention to the increase of piratical expeditions in the Persian Gulf issuing from that side of the Arabian littoral, where the Turkish Government claimed to have estab lished jurisdiction, and asking his co-operation in a plan of operations for the suppression of the piracies north of Odeid. Mr. Goschen's proceedings were approved, but he was warned not to entangle himself in any discussion with the Porte about the territorial question. 77. As no arrangement could be arrived sS' D^cembei 1881, No8. 224-IB8. at with either the Porte or the Pasha of Baghdad, Her Majesty's Government ulti mately decided that the naval officers on the East Indian Station should not he hampered by the three mile limit in pursuing pirate craft in Turkish waters.

In November 1879, Colonel Ross reported the removal of a section of „ _ „ the Al-bu-Kowarah tribe from Bidaa to political a, decemoer 18/9. nos. 692- 9 . Poweyrat, and stated that he would make further enquiries on the subject. 78-A. Captain Woodroffe had at this time been ordered to convey the Political Resident's messages to the Chiefs of Katar and Bahrein warning them against mixing themselves in the Beni Hajir piracies. Advantage was taken of this visit of Captain Woodroffe to make enquiries about the shifting of the tribe. He was accompanied by the Native Agent. Jasim bin Mahomed Thani of Bidaa accused the Sheikh of Bahrein of having instigated the Al-bu-Kowarah to remove to Poweyrat, and from the reports of the Native Agent it seemed that some of the elders of the tribe went to Bahrein and were there given presents. 78-B. In submitting the reports of Captain Woodroffe and the Native Agent Colonel Ross expressed his opinion that the removal of Sheikh Mahomed bin Said arose from jealousv of Jasim bin Political a , February 1880, No. si. Thani, who as the nominee of the Turks had obtained ascendancy at Bidaa. He remarked that it was evident that the secession had caused much irritation to Jasim, and satisfaction to the Bahrein Sheikh. Threatened attack on Bahrein hy Nasir-hin-Moharik and Sheikh Jasim of Bidaa—188i. 79. In March 1881 the island of Bahrein was threatened with attack by the notorious refugee Nasir-bin-Mubarik, acting with the connivance of Jasim-bin- Mahomed and as there seemed reason to suspect, encouraged by the Turkish authorities in Arabia. Under these circumstances the Government of India caused Sheik Jasim to be warned that if he was in any manner accessory to an attack upon Bahrein, he would be held directly responsible notwithstanding that he flew the Turkish Plag and received a Turkish garrison; while the Political A^ent in Turkish Arabia was instructed formally to intimate to the Ottoman authorities that unless they could undertake to prevent and punish piracies on the island from that part of the coast over which jurisdiction was claimed by the2i Porte, the Indian Government might be compelled in certain eventualities to Pro, No, 237 of Sec.

The following correspondence between Jasim bin Mahomed, Chief Political A, Jane 1881, No. 419-422. ? f and the Political Eesldcnt, Is interesting as showing the intended move ments of this chief towards Odeid :— After compliments.—-I beg to inform you regarding the village of Odeid that I intend to make it habitable by placing some of my followers to reside there for the purpose of protecting my neighbourhood against robbers by land and sea, and I like to explain this intention to you that you may warn (people on) the Oman sides against committing violence by sea on our men, who wish to reside there (Odeid), as affairs of the sea concern God, and then the British Government. But as regards my men who want to dwell there, I agree to bind myself (to be answerable) for all that may result from them, (such as) violence, mischief and breaking of the peace of the sea. For the purpose of explaining to you this matter, it has become necessary to write this explanation, £0. Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Ross replied (letter No. 176, dated 19th May 1881) :— ' You are aware that the British Government decided that Odeid is under the Chief of Abuthabi. It is therefore impossible to allow any of your people to settle there, and I request that you will dismiss the intention from your mind.' 81. The Government of India in reporting these proceedings expressed the opinion that Colonel Ross acted rightly in treating the proposal as inadmissible.

The Sheikh soon after intimated his having relinquished his intention Secret 1891, December, N ob . 224-268. pCCUpying Odeid, but informed the Political Resident of his plan of sendino- a force by sea to attack his enemies the Ajman Bedouins in the nei^hbour^ hood of Katif and also of his resolve to seize Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khacfim, the head of the Kubeysat, formerly of Odeid; as to the former proposal,'the Political Resident only warned Sheikh Jasim from disturbing the peace by sea by the intended expedition, and as regards the latter, he was informed that the British Government would not permit hostile maritime expeditions in waters where the maritime truce was in force and maintained and guarded by British ships of war. In reporting these proceedings to the Government of India, Colonel Ross drew attention to an engagement entered into by the father of Sheikh Jasim in 1868 not to make war by sea, but pointed out that since then the political status of the Sheikh of Bidaa had been changed by the acceptance by them on 1871 of the Turkish flag and a Turkish Garrison. 83.

Policy as to relations to be maintained with Sheikh Jasim and the Turkish Government in Katar—1881. 85. The Government of India also, in acknowledging the receipt of the Secretary of States Despatch J no . 31, dated 26th August 1881,* referred to above, requested instructions in respect' of the relations to be maintained with Sheikh Jasim, in their Despatch 145, dated 30th October 18S1, which on Pro. No. 256 of Sec., December 1881. Nos. 224- ? CC0Unt of ^6 important points it raises 258. is quoted in full below:— 2. Your Lordship expresses approval of the orders issued by the Government of India ia this matter, j^nd, as some months have passed since the issue of those orders without any further threat of an attack upon Bahrein, it may be inferred that their effect has been bene- * Fide paragraph 79 ante.ficial. It is'very unlibely that Nasir Un Mubarik will abandon hia designs upon the island, and fresh disturbances on his part must be apprehended from time to time; but if Uis principal supporter, the Sheikh of El Bidaa, can be deterred from affording him help and encourage ment, much of his power for mischief will have been taken away. In our opinion there ia reason to hop* that the Sheikh will not disregfard the warning conveyed to him by Colonel Ross, and that so far as Bahrein is concerned, his proceedings may for the future be less op*n to suspicion. 8. We have now, however, to forward for Your Lordship's orders some further papers reo-ardin^ the position and proceedings of this Chief, an^ to ask for Your Lordship s inst^uo- tions with respect to the general question of his furture relations with the British Government. Your Lordship is aware that the Sheikh has before now entertained the hope of gaining a footing to the eastward, at Odeid, and that he has been forbidden from establishing a settlement at this spot on the ground that Odeid belonged to the Chief of Abuthabi. It dow appears that he has again shown a desire to send an expedition into the waters of the trucial Chiefs, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf has informed him that such a movement could not be'permitted. We have approved of the Kesident's action in this matter But Colonel Ross further reports, in a letter* of the 16th August, which forms an enclosure to this despatch, that Jasim bin Mnhummad has announced his inteation of sending a force by sea to attack his enemies, the Ajman Bedouins, in the neighbourhood of El Katif ; and it is with special reference to this matter that we now address lour Lordship. 4. Your Lordship is aware that the Sheikh is nominally under Turkish jurisdiction, a fact which greatly complicates our dealings with him in all cases ; and in the present instance his proposal is of such a nature that there is some reason to doubt whether the B itish Govern ment would be justified in actively interfering against him. The Katif coast is in such close proximity to Bahrein that any expedition to this neighbourhood may easily have the effect of disturbing the security of the island, while it would also in all pr lability lead to the renewal of piracies and disorder in the adjoining waters. On the other hand, the r e is no definite ground for regarding the expedition as directed against our feudatory, so that we have some hesitation in treating it as a matter to which Your Lordship's orders of the 26th August would apply; and. further, until piracies actually result from the despatch of the force, it appears to us that our cruisers cannot act against the Sheikh's boats under the instructions conveyed in Your Lordship's despatchf No. 28 of the 5th August, by which we were informed that Her Majesty's vessels need nipt be too much hampered by the three mile limit in pursu ing pirate cr^ft into Turkish waters. Under these circumstances Colonel Ross has not thought it proper to interfere authoritatively in order to prevent the expedition, and we have expressed concurrence in, and approval of, his views. 5 Your Lordship will observe a reference in the 3rd paragraph of Colonel Ross's letter of the 16th August to an engagement made in 1868 by the father of the present Sneikh not to make war by sea. As this agreement had something of a personal character, and as its force may be hfdd to have been weakened, if not annulled, by the Turkish assumption of authority over El Bidaa, we have thought it better for the present not to lay any stress on it. In reply, however, to Colonel Ross's letter, the Sbe-kh has just written to say that he pro poses to abide generally by Colonel Ross's instructions, and not to commence any warlike undertaking without his permission. Notwithstanding, therefore, his connection with the Turkish Government, the Sheikh may be willing to admit as binding on hira the engagement made by his father; and, if so, the result may he to contribute materially to the sacurty of Bahreiu and the neighbouring seas. We shall instruct the Resident to bear the point in mind, and to take any suitable opportunity that may occur of ascertaining whether the engage- meot may still be treated as in force. 86. The Secretary of State replied in Pro. Ko. 122, Sec., May 1882, Nop. 122-126. No . 3,' dated iOth January 1882 2. The Chief in question occupies apart of the coast wh^the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Sultan has not- been formally recognized by Her Majesty s Government, and is, in fa^t, little more than nominal; but he appears to fly the Turkish tlag on shore, and to have admitted a Turkish gamson into his fort. On the ot her hand, he is in constant communication with the British Resident in the Gulf ; he has lately abandoned a contemplated maritime expedition to the neighbourhood of the Turkish port of Katif, in deference to the remonstrances of that officer, to whose orders in such matters he professes his intention to submit; and he has ex- plic tly stated that ho regards the seas of those parts as being ' under the British Govern ment,' 3. It seems, therefore, that to whatever extent the Chief may have accepted the position of an Ottoman dep ndant, he, like his father before him, maintains very close and direct rela tions with the authorities of .he Indian Government, and is prepared to defer to them in all matters affecting the peace of the seas. In the opinion of Her Majesty 's Government, thia disposition on the part of the Sheikh should be encouraged. There is nothing in it incom patible with corresponding relations on his part with the Turks as regards his affairs on land, while, if he act up to his professions, and abstain from ill-treatment of British subjects, the • Vide paragraph 82 ante. f Vide paragraph 77 ante.precise nature of those relations may be a matter of comparative indifference to the Indian &lt;iovernment, whose cooBisient policy has been to restrict its interference with the tribes on the Arab coast, whether parties to the maritime truce or not, to the measures necessary to prevent hostilities at sea, and to hold aloof from their quarrels and concerns on the mainland, lo this policy Her Majesty's Government desire to adhere. 4. As regards the course which should be followed in the event of the Sheikh of El-Bidaa, or any other Chief similarly situated, putting to sea with hostile intentions, without rfference to, or in disregard of, the warnings of the B iti^h Resident, it is not possible for me to give Your Excellency in Council precise instructions. It must depend upon the circumstances of each particular case, and upon the extent to which the peace of the seas may be menaced. From the correspondence which lias passed within the last two years on the subject of Turkish pretensions to jurisdiction along the Arab coast, it will have been seen that, while Her Majesty's Government are not disposed to object to extension of the buitan's authority over the tribes of the Gutlur peninsula, provided such authority be effectively exercised, it is their fixed determination neither to allow the Turkish local officials to use the ^^-independent tribes as inUrumentt of aggression on Bahrein and the territories of the T'ucial Chiefs, nor to permit the tribes to cirry on piratical expeditions With impunity under the shelter of the lurhish flag. The question, therefore, whether coe'don should be employed upon any particular occasion is one which must be decided by Your Excellency's Government upon general considerations of expe'iie^cy, with special reference to your interest in the maintenance of peace at sea as well as your obligations to the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs. 5. From the foregoing observations, Your Excellency in Council will perceive that the instructions lately issued to the Commanders of Her Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf were not intended t.&gt; bear the very restricted construction which has been placed, upon them by your Government anl by the Resident in the Gulf. As Her Majesty s Ambassador at Con- -T .~ ... , t ^ ^ • t . t -.r stantinople was instructed to mtimate to the • Lord Granville to Lord Duffenn, No, 515, -p, , v. ^ T ■■ , . ., , &lt;• ,i m i • i dated 22nd July 1881. Porte* in July last, the retusal of the Turkish Government to entertain the proposals trade to it for a sort of joint police of the seas along the Arab coast compelled Her Majesty's Govern ment to undertake that duty single-handed ' without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial jurisdiction in those waters.' The instructions in question were accordingly issued, the intention being that the Commanders of British cruisers in the Gulf should have liberty to act as might be necessary to prevent or punish disturbance of the peace of the seas, avoid ing-, however, the raising of needless questions with the Turkish local authorities where they exist, or unnecessary encroachment upon the jurisdiction of the Sultan, wherever it may really be effectively established along the coast north of Odeid. 87. Further on account of repeated ill-treatment of British Indian subjects c t ' iqqo xt aa ? a ** Bidaa, the Government of India again Sec., January 1882, Nos. 443-456. . , T „ , , , ® in Secret letter ]So. 3, dated the 9th January 1882, requested the instructions of Her Majesty's Government in respect of the policy to be adopted towards the Sheikh of Bidaa, on the Katar Coast of Arabia, in order to restrain him from ill-treatment of British Indian traders resident there. They proposed to inform the Sheikh that arbitrary treatment of British Indian subjects could not be permitted, and that, in future, he would he held directly responsible for any act inconsistent with the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between him and British Government. Her Majesty's Government approved of a communication in the foregoing Sec,. May 1882, Km. s-is. sense boin S to tbe Sheikh. 'They trusted that it might prove suflBcient for the subject in view, and that the liesident in the Gulf might be able to obtain redress for any well-founded grievances of British subjects, without being compelled to request the sanction of the Government to coercive measures, which the Sheikh's relations with the Porte rendered it desirable to avoid as long as possible. Ill-treatment of British Indian subjects by Sheikh Jasim and exaction of fine from him, 1880-1882. 88. In 1880 British Indian subjects at Bidaa complained of ill-treatment, and at the same time the Sheikh Jasim bin-Thani and some of his neighbours including Sheikh Nasir-bin-Mobarik appparently intended to resume hostilities by sea, which would have caused a revival of piracy. This latter ques tion was first dealt with, as noted above—see paragraphs 74—77 ; the principal difficulty being that Sheikh Jasim and certain other Chiefs were under Turkish portection. After negotiations with the Turkish Government, Her Majesty's Government finally decided that expeditions by sea, and piracy, should, if necessary be prevented by force, and the native craft might27 be pursued even in Turkish waters. Meanwhile the British Indian traders Proceedings 241-256 of Secret December 188', Nos. at Bldsa made DeW COHlplflints and 22 J'- 58 '. M , qn M ,000 Nna Colonel Ross proposed that Sheikh Jasim Procecdinars No. 130 of Secret E , May 1882, .Nos. r r . , -i ^ ]27-131. should be made to sign an agreement by which he recosrnized the validity of an agreement concluded in 1868 between his father and the British authorities. The principal conditions were that he should not make war by sea, and that he should refer disputes to the Besident. The Government of India were, however, of opinion that a written agreement might bring about difficulties with the Turks, and the Besident was instiucted to obtain a verbal assurance from the Sheikh to the effect that he would adhere to the old agreement. This was done, and Sheikh Jasim made peace with his neighbours, principally with the Chief of Bahrein. SS-A. In the year 1882 however Sheikh Jasim forcibly shut the shops of the British Indian traders, and expelled secret e.. February 1883, Nos. i-82. them from his country. He was warned that he would be held responsible for any harm done to British subjects, but the warning had no effect. Colonel Boss then reported that it would hc\ve the verv worst effect in the Gulf if stringent measures were not applied. He asked for permission to employ force if necessary, but he hoped to be able to settle the case without having recourse to open hostilities if he were allowed to use his discretion. After some telegraphic correspondence with the Secretary of State, Government gave the required permission, and the Besident was instructed, to obtain from the Sheikh—(1) an apology to the British Government; (2) indemnity for the traders; (3) permission for the traders to return. Colonel Boss then proceeded to Bidaa with two men-of-war, and obtained what he wanted without actually having recourse to force. This was in December 1882 The indemnity paid by the Sheikh amounted to Bs. 8,000, and this sum was handed over to the traders who had taken refuge in Bahrein, They were also told that they might return to Bidaa, and four of their number went there a few days after. 88-B Sheikh Jasim however tried to turn the tables against the Banians by a new manoeuvre. They found that their houses had been given to other trades and the Sheikh refused to protect them, or to assist them in any way in recovering their outstanding claims, all under the pretence fhat he had retired into privatelife, and handed over the Government of the place to the Turks. The traders also reported that Sheikh Jasim had complained to the Mutasserif of Hassa and to the Governor of Basra of the way he had been treated by the Besident, saying that if the Bs. 8,000 were not repaid, he would resign his post as Kaimakam. This report was confirmed by the resident Agent, 1 Bahrein. The Sheikh wrote in the same secret e., february 1883, Nos. 226-238. sense to the Chief of Bahrein, who for- warded his letter to Colonel Boss. The See May 1883, Nos. 24I5-256. Besident answered that the Sheikh's letter was rather obscure, but the Chief of Bahrein might tell him that as long as he did not interfere with British subjects, the authorities had every wish to be on good terms with him, and would always be willing to meet his wishes as far as they were compatible with the general interest. In January 1883 a fifth Banian returned to Bidaa and met with the same reception as his predeces sors. The Sheikh still maintained that he had nothing to do^with the^ Govern ment of Bidaa, and referred the traders to the Turkish Kazi. This official protected the banians, but he did not appear to have any authority in the country, and the banians complained that under the present circumstances they could not recover their outstanding claims, and would find it difficult to continue their trade. 89. In reply to Sheikh Jasim's representations, the Turkish authorities proceedings 218-234 of secret e., may 1883, nos. at Hasa and Baghdad seemed to have 218-245. disapproved of his action in expelling the Banians.

'In Conclusion, I teg leave to remind 80 ' 100 * It our Excellency that the claims of the Porte to rights of severeignty over the Katnr Coast have never been admitted by Eer Majesty 1 s Oovernment' This elicited a protest from the Turkish Ambassador, and, in reply. Lord Granville wrote, 22nd September lfc83.

Sheikh Jasim however still persisted in maintaining that Katar Political Resident's letter No. 98, dated i6th May belonged to the Turkish Government 1884, secret e., june 1884, nos. aoa-sio. and that the British Government should have dealings with their officials, not with him; since.he was only a merchant who wished to be on terms of friendship with the British in regard to his personal affairs. But it will be seen hereafter that he never ceased to make himself obnoxious to the British and their subjects in Katar and was really at the bottom of many of the piracies and outrages against the British Indian traders on the Katar coast. The one cause of his hostility against the British was what he thought to be the intrusion of the Indian Banians in Bidaa to deprive him of the profits he had been making by having the monoply of the trade in pearls in that place, and the protection which the British Government extended to them. He therefore threw himself into the arms of the Turkish Government. He'had been appointed by them their Kaimmakam. Nou t^at he had to pay such a heavy fine as Rs. 8,000, he resigned his appointment under the Turkish Government, but they do not seem to have ever accepted his resignation.

In May 1884 we find him A. Political E., August 1884, Nos. 279-286. ^ t ,.* 7 , preparing an expedition against a branch of the Beni Hajir tribe, who resided near Katif. He wrote to the Chief of Bahrein to say that he had obtained the permission of the Turkish Government, and to ask the Chief's intercession to obtain the permission of the British Government. The Chief of Bahrein feared that the expedition was really intended against his island. The Politieal Resident feared that it would likely cause alarm and confusion in the Bahrein sea and might lead to worse consequences, and therefore thought it advisable to warn Sheikh Jasim against the undertaking. Fight between the Ejman and allied tribes on one side, and the Morah and Manosir tribes on the other, 1884, 93.

The people of Katar had apprehended an attack by the Ejmans, but it happened that the latter marched to a watering place named Buneyyan, situated between Katar and Oman, where the encounter took place. The Ejman forces, who numbered about 2,000, were said to have lost about 800 killed. This result of the hostile movements of the tribes had been a source of great anxiety to Sheikh Jasim, who would have suffered con siderably by having to keep back the divers of Katar in the face of the dis turbed condition of the district.29 Disputes between Sheikh Jasim and the Chief of Abu-Thabi. Jasim's intention to occupy Odeid and the ill-treatment of Banians at Bidaa, 1885 86. 94 Of the Arab Chiefs who were his neighbours, Sheikh Jasim directed External A. Proceeding., September 1886. ^Akh Zaid-blli-Kha lifa, Chief of Abu Tliabi. His charges against this chief in 1885 were: (1) that Sheikh Zaid had stood security for a debt of Es. 4,000, which had not been discharged in due time; (2) ttiat he had kept with him a body of Manasar who had plundered Jasim people on the island of Dalma and whom he employed on raiding into Jasim's territory ; and (3) that he interfered with Odeid, which belonged to Jasim, and which had been destroyed. Jasim wished to restore the town of Odeid and re-inhabit it, and asked the Political Resident's permission for the purpose. He assured him that no acts of aggression would result from this occupation, and that he would hold himself responsible for any such acts. The Political Agent told him to give up this idea. 95. The Sheikh felt extremely annoyed at this reply, and in his next letter External A, January 1886, Nos. 38 44. ^ ^ 0 hfical Kesideijt, lie expressed himself in rather strong terms. The Poli tical Resident did not, however, attach much importance to the Sheikh's hasty and intemperate language, which was characteristic of the man. 96. On the 31st August 1886, the Resident at Bushire telegraphed that External A., September 1886, Nob . 312-826. ^ 38 a ^ 0Ut P ro Ceed to Odeid, with people to settle there, and that some Beni Hajir Bedouins had attacked the Hindu traders at Bidaa, killing one, and wounding another. The detailed report which followed stated that the attack on the Hindus had not been confirmed. But Colonel Miles considered the rumour was well founded, inasmuch as Jasim when announcing his intention to quit Bidaa had taken every precaution to disavow his responsibility for the safety of the Banians who lived and traded there. 97. Advantage was taken by Sheikh Jasim of the Chief of Odeid's absence at IVlaskat to leave Bidaa for Odeid, but Jasim was warned by Colonel Miles to abandon any intention he might have of occupying the place, and the Senior Naval Officer was requested to arrange for a vessel to proceed to the Arab Coast as tarly as possible. 98. On the 16th September, the Resident telegraphed that the attack on the Hindus had been somewhat exaggerated as the two men were only wounded He, however, proposed sending the Assistant Resident, Khan Bahadur Hakim Abdul Rahman to enquire into the case and ascertain as to the security of the traders. 99. These proceedings were approved in Foreign Department letter No. 2387, dated the 22nd October 1886. 100. In No. 143, dated 6th October 1886, Colonel Miles expressed his Eiternal A., May 1887, Nos. 269-290. ^ ia * ; attack On the Hindus had been deliberately planned by Sheikh Jasim in concert ?rith his son whom he left in charge at Bidaa, the object being to intimidate the banians and so induce them to quit Bidaa where they were Jasim's rivals in trade. ^ The men assaulted were apparently not much hurt, but in the interests of the large British Indian trading community along the Persian and Arab Coasts, the Resident recommended that due notice should be taken of the case and a suitable tine inflicted on Sheikh Jasim as compensation to the two men injured. Sheikh Jasim had returned to Bidaa, and with regard to his desiVna on Odeid Colonel Miles thought that— u^igns 'though hp undoubtedly still hankers after that pW and is unable to conceal his amhit : ons to recover it, 1 do not now believe they werp mad« with any serious intention of settling there his object seems simply to have been out of the way during the attack upon the Banyans/' ' As the Turkish Admiral at Basra had disavowed and censured the action of the Commander of the Zohaffm writing to the Chief of Abuthabi that he had orders to occupy Odeid, Colonel Miles thought that no further notice ne^ be taken of Jasim's visit to that place.80 101. The Political Resident later on reported that Jasim emphatically denied his complicity in the attack on the British Indian traders, and apolo gised for the occurrence. This denial and apology were accepted under the orders of the Government of India. Outrages against British Indians under Jasim's instigations. Sheikh Jasim made to pay a fine, 1887. 102.

Eeports sent by Colonel Ross in July 1887 showed that the Sheikh's withdrawal from Bidaa had been followed by disorder there, and disturbances in the neigh bourhood. The bazaar of Bidaa was plundered by the Beni Hajir ; and certain Persian traders, who had incurred Sheikh Jasim's displeasure, suffered ; but the Hindu traders were protected by the Sheikh's relatives. The attack w r as attri buted by the Political Resident to the Sheikh's influence. Early in August, Colonel Ross telegraphed that two Indian traders had been ' wantonly wounded at Bidaa by Arabs,' and that there had been several practical outrages on the Katar Coast. The Resident had the Indian traders at Bidaa removed, and H. M. S. Osprey went to Bahrein. From the first the Resident regarded Sheikh Jasim as responsible, and this impression was confirmed by enquiries made by the Pirst Assistant Resident and by Colonel Ross himself. The latter telegraphed on the 21st August— 4&lt; I consider compensation should be exacted from Jasim for wounds and losses of British Indian traders and plunder of Bahrein and Persian vessels by pirates, and fine imposed in addition.' With this view Colonel Ross got the Chief of Bahrein to ' lay an embargo ' upon specie and pearls belonging to Sheikh Jasim at Bahrein, aggregating Rs. 20,000 in value. On the 2ord August, the Resident followed up his tele gram with a letter, which was emphatic in fixing responsibility upon Sheikh Jasim. Referring to the Bahrein Chiefs attachment of Sheikh Jasim's pro perty, the Resident remarked :— ' If Government should approve of my proposal to exact componeation from Jasim this seizure may obviate the necessity of employing- naval force. If that recommendation should not be adopted, the property can be returned to Jasim's Agent.' In the next letter of any importance, dated the 10th September, the Resi dent reported on his measures for checking piracies : he did not anticipate any more. He also mentioned that the— ' Commandant of the Turkish troops in Hasa came via Ojair with about eight gendarmes and proceeded to Bidaa, where he was in constant consultation with Jasim and other not ables.' 103. Colonel Ross' letter, dated the 12th September, forwarded communi cations addressed by Sheikh Jasim to a merchant at Basrah and to the Walis of Basra and Baghdad, are dated the 25th August, complaining of the seizure by Colonel Ross, of 'all' the Sheikh's proper y in Bahrein, a measure which they said was the result of the Sheikh's subjection to the Turkish Government. The ISheikh appealed to the Walis against the action of the Resident. 104. There were received then telegrams from the Resident— (а) The telegram of the 3rd October, stated that the Porte had tele graphed to the Basrah Wali for a detailed report on recent events and British action as to Katar. Colonel Ross asked, 'When may I expect decision regarding same ?' (б) The telegram of 4th October said—' Governor of Hasa addressed Bahrein Chief threatening letter demanding release (of) Jasim's property, I don't know if under higher authority, probably not.' (c) Telegram of the 6th October said-—' Jasim agrees to pay British and Bahrein claims and I hope to settle the business accordingly amicably. I would not press fine.' 1Q5. On the 15th October 1887, the Potitical Resident telegraphed that Article 296 of demi-official. Sheikh Jasim had laid up all British and Bahrein claims for outrages and piracies at Katar Coast, that his property under detention had been released, and that81 piracies were stopped so far as Jasim's jurisdiction went and that British rela tions were placed on former friendly footing. The Government of India expressed their satisfaction at this happy result. Protests of Porte against British Government's proceedings, 1888. 106.

Her Majesty's Government on 17th April 1888 invited Sir W. White 's attention to the views expressed by them in 1883, namely, that Her Majesty 's No si of ditto Government are not prepared to waive the right which they have exercised at inter- vals during a long period of years, of dealing directly with the Arab Chiefs of the Katar coast when necessary in order to preserve the place of the seas or to obtain for outrages on British subjects, or on persons entitled to British Protection, The despatch added :— ' Her Majesty's Government continue to hold that view and they are equally unable to admit any claim of the Porte to jurisdiction over the Chief of Bahrein, whom as they have once intimated, tkey regard as an independent ruler and with whom they are on treaty relations. ' Question of the withdrawal of the Turkish Garrison from Bidaa, 1887. 107. In Government of India's despatch No. 2-0., dated the 14th Decem ber 1887, which related to the disturbances on the Katar coast, they stated ^ „ t , 0 oo that it might be necessary to address the External A, March 1888, Noi. 158-806. „ ^ 0 on ^ ^ l Secretary of State again on the subject on th^ receipt of a further report from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Colonel Ross was asked to report (a) on the origin and history of the Turkish establishment at Bidaa, the strength of the garrison, the nature and objects of the occupation; and (6) the views as illustrated by correspondence and by his own experience, which had been held on the subject generally. His letter No. 341, dated the 24ith December 1887, was the reply. 103. With regard to {a), the story briefly was as follows :— In June 1871, a Turkish expeditionary force, under the command . _ , 000 „ of Nafiz Pasha, landed at Katif in order External A, June 1888, Not. 130-141. . i.i t • i. &lt;? tt to occupy the district of Hasa. At the time of this enterprise a deputation was sent in July of the same year to the port of Bidaa under the Sheikh of Koweit. That Chief persuaded the Arab Sheikhs of Bidaa to hoist the Turkish flag, and to accept the suzerainty of the Porte in pursuance of this assumption of authority, but independently of their operations against Hasa. A Turkish Commodore proceeded in January 1872 to the Katar coast with two ships carrying a battalion of Infantry, from which he landed a detachment of 100 men with a field piece at Bidaa. It was known that Sheikh Jasim was the instrument through which the Turkish intrigue was .effected. His father, Sheikh Muhammad, was said to have been opposed to the landing of the Turkish Guard, though apparently ready to use the Turkish flag in order to avoid British interference. Regular troops appeared to have been withdrawn from the Turkish stations on the Arabian coast in 1873, and were replaced by ' zaptihs ' or ' gendarmes. ' There were, it is stated, only thirty of these then at the fort of Bidaa. Although it was through Jasim that the Turks were admitted to Bidaa, it appeared that he was thoroughly tired of their espionage, and most anxious to get the garrison withdrawn. 109. As to the nature and objects of the occupation on the part of the Turks, Colonel Ross gave no decided opinion. The object, however, appeared throughout to have been the preservation on the spot of some semblance of that authority which was claimed by the Porte along the entire Katar coast. More than this the feeble nature of the occupation had proved powerless to carry out.32 110. In answer to the second enquiry, (6), Colonel Ross reported Mat his opinion in 1879 was that the de facto position of the Turks at Bidaa should be recognised, and that he was inclined to the view that the Turkish Government should on certain conditions be invited to accept the responsibility for the maintenance of order along the whole sea coast of Katar as far as Bidaa. But this view had been altered, and he thought that, after his further eocperience and observation of the mode of procedure and policy of the Turkish authorities on the Arabian side of the Gulf it seemed hopeless to expect a state of security to result from Turkish exclusive control, even where they were firmly established. He therefore considered it would be inexpedient to countenance any further extension of their jurisdiction. Further than this, as the presence of the ineffective Turkish guard at Bidaa and their nominal authority there added to the difficulty of refusing to countenance any further jurisdiction along the Katar coast, he again urged the institution of diplomatic action in order to induce the Borte to withdraw altogether from that place. 111. Colonel Ross was asked to give his views as illustrated bv corres pondence on this subject; but he answered by a reference only to a number of letters, wherein he said the opinions were stated which had given rise to the views expressed by the Government of India and the Home Government as noted above. 112. As regards the question of the withdrawal of the Turkish garrison, the Political Resident was informed that it would be useless to press the question. (1) Turkish expansion along the Arab coast. (2) Policy of the British Government, 1888. 113. 'While these events were taking place in Katar, Colonel Tweedie Nos. 131-137 of External a , June less. No. 130- alarmed by the gradual progress of Otto- man expansion in the Eastern part of the Arabian peninsula, ma^e a reference to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople, who in his turn asked the advice of the Foreign Office. The following extract from the reply of February 1888 of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs approved by the India Office, indicates the policy of Her Majesty's Government on the question :— ' Your Excellency is aware that within certain specified limits Her Majesty's Government not only admit the jurisdiction of the Porte on that coast, but have frequently urged that it should be effectively asserted for the maintenance of public security and order. ' On the other hand there are certain Chiefs along another portion of the coast in question, who Her Majesty's Government regard as independent, and with whom they have concluded treaty engagements for the suppression of piracy and slave trade and for the maintenance of peace among themselves.' 114. The Foreign Office then called attention to Her Majesty's Govern ment's previous declarations objecting to any attempt on the part of the Porte to assert or acquire authority over these Chiefs. It may be noted that in this declaration of policy there is no reference to the Katar peninsula, (1) Hostilities between Sheikh Jasim, and Sheikh Zaid of Abu Thabi. (2) Reported movement of the Chief of Jebel Shammar Ibn Rashid towards Oman in order to give aid to Sheikh Jasim, 1888-1889. 115. Soon afterwards we find Sheikh Jasim again on the war path against his inveterate enemy, the Chief of Abu Thabi. It appears that about this time a son of Sheikh Zaid (Chief of Abu-Thabi)made a raid into Bidaa and in the fight that ensued, one of Jasim's sons was killed. In order to avenge the death of his son. Sheikh Jasim endeavoured to incite against Sheikh Zaid, the Turks, who were ever ready for an opportunity to interfere in Oman affairs and thus extend their in- .. . . , oq - xt ^o, fluence in that country. He wrote with External A, August 1888, Koi. 76-81. . i. i -t, nr a t r it .. this view to the Atutasarnf of Hassa. He made overtures to the Chiefs of Bahrein and got himself reconciled with them, with the object probably of having their sympathy in his project and leaving no33 enemies beliind. These overtures were encouraged by the Political Resident so „ „ . „ far as they were consistent with their No. 76 of External E, August 1888, I mos . &lt;6-81. • ij • l l i it cii, m -u rights, interests, and obligations. Sheikh Jasim also carried on secret negotiations external a , less, i..., 569.670. with th0 Beni Gaffir ghgikhs and the Chie£ of Debai and the Najim Bedouins, but it appears his success in that direction did „ , . not amount to much. He also endeavoured External A, September 1888, Noa. 69-78. i-i- • j _ i n i i • ± a ^ mi i - to bring into the field against Abu-Thabi, the powerful Chief of Jebel Shammer, Mohammad Ibn-Rashid, who ruled over Nejd. He wrote about this time several letters to the Political Resident, dwelling upon the injustice done to him by the British Government in siding with the Chief of Abu Thabi, who had committed raids into his territory and inflicted so many wrongs on him and his tribe. The Political Resident furnished Govern- ment with a memorandum tracing the history of the hostilities of the two Chiefs against each other—(which is printed as an appendix A to this precis). 116. In October 1888, Colonel Ross paid a visit to Bidaa and had a con- . . v -.r versation with Sheikh Jasim, who came to External A, November 1888, Nos. 97-99. j i • • i i h™ j i meet him accompanied by 700 mounted Arabs. He reiterated his complaints regarding the unjust treatment accorded to him, and pretended to know nothing of the objective of the movements of Ibn Rashid towards Oman. 117. It was about this time that the Turks strengthened their force in b c f-tw 1 . « . . 1CQQ VT 00/?0 Katar, so that they had 400 regular in- Pro. 64 of External A, September 1888, Nos. 38-68. « , ,, mi -i • j • j i fantry there. The subjugation 01 Central Nejd by the Chief of Shammer had greatly strengthened the Turkish position in Hassa and those parts. The Government of India had reason to believe that a serious movement was contemplated towards Oman, which would lead to Tur kish domination eastwards. It was also feared that Ibn R.ashid would lead or despatch a large force into Oman, with Turkish support from Hassa and Katar, and that in the political state of that time at Oman, a Nejd force w r ould very easily effect the conquest of^Oman to the Indian Ocean, unless the British Government interposed. The Government of India therefore suggested to the Secretary of State that the Porte should be strongly warned that Turkish inter ference could not be tolerated. 118. In January 1889 reports were received from various sources saying that e^nai a, august i 88 9, no., m-stos. 1™™ accompanied by Abdur Kahman bm-Jjeysal and Ibn-Sabhan, Deputy of Ibn Rashid, and taking a large army with him, had arrived at Elzufrah and Livah, which lie within the territories of the Abu-Thabi Chief, that they massacred the inhabitants and cut down the date trees and had committed other atrocities against the people. 119. In March 1889, Colonel Ross in reporting on the raid of Sheikh No. 260 of Ditto. Jasim, pointed out that the only way of re storing peace would be some joint action of the British and Turkish authorities^ and this could only take place if the Turkish Jurisdiction at JSidaa was recognised. 120. On the 23rd May 1889, Colonel Ross reported that Sheikh Jasim had No. sol of Ditto. suffered a severe reverse in a battle with the Chief of Abu-Thabi. But it was found afterwards that only a large number of camels belonging to Katar tribes had been taken by Sheikh Zaid's forces, that Sheikh Zaid had intended to march against Bidaa itself, but that on account of scarcity of w r ater and the strong position taken by Sheikh Jasim, he retreated—after however plundering the country, punishing the tribes and carrying away some 2,000 camels and a large booty. Jasim carrying munitions of war by sea, 1889. 121. In his letter No. 117, dated the 16th May 1889, Colonel Ross reported No. 289 of External A, August 1889, Nos. 233- OU the Subject of a Complaint that Sheikll 500 ' Jasim had sent munitions of war by sea, in furtherance of his warlike operations against Abu-Thabi, to a place beyond thelimits o£ his jurisdiction, and within those o£ the Ahuthahi Chief. He also observed — ^ it has been ruled by the Govern- metrand mtbt subject tbem to penalties. Whilst abiding by thk necessary rule themselvj the ^'Trucial' Chiefs naturally expect ns to impose a similar restnct.on on the Katar Chief who indeed doM not repudiate the obligation, but boldly claims S.la as Kat.r terntory, and farther denies having sent boats to that place with war stores. ^ ' I think perhaps the Govemmeut of India would not think inexpedient in present c.r- » t,, L a at a nenaltv from Sheikh Jasim, which woold mean employment of Naval for' but 1 think it would be desirable to authorize me to intimate to Jasm the di^PproTal and displeasure of Government at his action, and to inform him that a repetition of it would lead 'measures of a more serious nature. The delicacy of the position as regards Katar requires me to seek the instruotion of Government m this case. ^ 122 The Government of India thought that they would be justified in pun- ishing Sheikh Jasim for despatching muni- no. 303 of external a, auguit 1889, Nos. 233-306. ^ ons 0 f war 'by S ea in furtherance of hostile designs against the chief of Abu-Thahi. Having regard however to the Political Resident's recommendation, they directed him to inform Sheikh Jasim of their displeasure and warn him that a repetition of such acts as he had lately been guilty of would entail serious consequences. 123 In reply to the warning conveyed to him by the Political Resident, Sheikh Jasim maintnined that Sila was External a, September 1889, N ob . 163-166. -vvithin Katar and therefore within bis territory. The Political Kesident decided to take no notice of the Sheikh's animadversions. Tarkish project of re-building Zobarah, 1888. 124 On the 12th March 1S88 Colonel Eoss forwarded a translation of a letter dated 7th March from Sheikh Esau- No. 89 of External a, June 1s88, Nos. 87-94. 'bin-All, Chief of Bahrein, on the subject of the alleged intention of the Turkish authorities to place inhabitants in Zoba- rah, on the north-west coast of Katar, opposite the islands of Bahrein, and reported:— , . . 'The Chief apprehends tliat Nasir-hin-Muharak the refugee from Bahrein, will be mstri- gated to settle at Zobarah with his followers of the Beni Hajir tribe, and supported in doing *0 by the Turks, either directly or indirectly. There can be no doubt that if this measure were carried oat it would constitute a menace and standing danger to Bahrein, and the objection raised by the Chief of Bahrein is, assuming his information correct, reasonable. It will be observed, too, that the chief of Bahrein asserts a distinct claim to hereditary riehts over Zobarah. It is the case that the ancestors of the Bahrein Sheikhs originally colo nized Zobarah and built its fort, and thence conquered the islands of Bahrein. Theiicefor- ward until very recent times there continued to be a close political connection between Bah rein and Zobarah, the Sheikhs of the latter place being regarded, and regarding themselves as to some extent, dependents of the Bahrein Government. This connection was first severed bv desire of the Government of India, which ruled in 1874 that the Chief of Bahrein should desist from all interference on the mainland. Sheikh Esau, whilst maintaining a claim over Zobarah, complied with the advice of Government, and when, in 187S, his allies the No aim were attacked at Zobarah by Sheikh Jasim and Nasir-bin-Muharak, he consented to hold aloof, and the No^aim were expelled from the place. Since then it has remained uninhabited. &lt;( Turks have not hitherto asserted or exercised any authority or jurisdiction over Zobarah and the other villages on that part of the Katar promontory, and the policy_ of the Government of India has been adverse to jallowing them to extend their ^authority m that district. Further, if Nasir-bin-Mubarak and his Bedouins were permitted to settle there, the place would, in all probability, become a nest of pirates, and the interests which the British Government have at heart would undoubtedly suffer considerably. It Zobarah is to be rebuilt and peopled, this should be, I think, in justice, done only in a manner acceptable to the Chief of Bahrein. The settlers should be people friendly to him and not his enemies. ' In view firstly, to opposing the further extension of Turkish authority; secondly, of the due safety'of the Islands of Bahrein; and thirdly, of the preservation of tranquillity and35 security on the seas^ and prevention of piracy, it appears to me highly important that the settlement of Nasir-bin-Mubarak and his dependents at Zobarah should be forbidden and prevented. If this view is taken by His Excellency the Viceroy in Council I respectfully solicit instructions in this sense. It would be necessary, in the first instance, to warn Nasir- bin-Mubarak and Jasim -bin-Muhamniad Thani of this resolve of the British Government and if the warning were disregarded. Her Majesty's ships would have to be instructed to enforce the decision of Goverument.•' , 125. The Political Resident was told aocordingly to warn Sheikh Jasim and Nasir-bin-Mnbarak that no settlement Pro. No. 94 of ditto. gobarah would be permitted. A tele graphic reference was also made to the Secretary of State, but the reply received from the India Office was—' It is questionable whether any remonstrance should be made against a Turkish occupation of the place.' Turkish measures for establishing their jurisdiction on a firmer basis on the Arab coast. Increase of Turkish forces in Katar, 1888-89. 126. It appeared from the reports of Mr. Robertson, the Assistant Political Agent, Basra, (a) No. 122 of 12th March External A, February 1889, Nos. 336-346. ^ NOi X35 0 f the 22nd March 1888, that Nafiz Pasha, tbe Turkish Governor-General of Basra, had early in that year visited Katif and Katar with the object of taking measures for the suppression of piracy in the Persian Gulf, and that he bad taken pledges from Sheikh Jasim -bin-Thani of Katar, and Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab of Darain, for the security of the coasts and waters within their influence and jurisdiction, and had left with Jasim -bin-Thani a steam -launch and crew to be used in patrolling the coasts. His Excellency also provided coal depots at Ras-el-Tanurah and Bidaa. As a further measure for the security of the waters of the Persian Gulf, the Governor-General of Basra also established military posts at Bidaa, and a complete battalion of infantry, numbering about 400 men, was subse quently despatched from Basrah to form garrisons for the above-mentioned places. The garrisons were, however, placed there with the ostensible object of carrying out the wishes of Her Majesty's Government for the effectual suppression of piracy on the west coast of the Persian Gulf. 127. These facts were reported by the British Ambassador at Constantino ple to the Foreign Office, and on reference having been made to the India Office the following opinion was expressed by the Secretary of State for India : &lt;• Lord Cross thinks it may be sufficient for tbe present to acquaint Sir W. White, if the pro. No. 345 of External A. February 1889. Nos. Marquess of Salisbury sees no objection thereto, 386-346. that her Majesty s Government do not consider thai the Porte is in effective occupation of the Arabian coast leyond Eaiif, and that they adhere to' the declaration made in 1883 that the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Katar coast is not admitted by Her Majesty's Government. But as there is no reason to anticipate that any practical result would be attained by provoking a discussion with the Turkish Government as to the extent of its jurisdiction on that coast, it is undesirable to raise the question at the present time.' 128. The Porte wished now to give a plain indication of its ^ determination to assert its jurisdiction in Katar. In 1889, July 1889, Sir W. White (Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople) received a pro-memoria from the Turkish Eoreign Office to the effect that the troops in Katar were to be reinforced from the Baghdad Army Corps. In forwarding this pro-memoria Sir W. White observed— ' It is known that His Majesty the Sultan uncompromisingly asserts his rights over the Pro. No. 134 of Secret E.. September 1889, Nos. Kata* coast, and Her Majesty's o G ^ V f ^ 128-137, Porei^n Office dospatcli No, 338, dated 5tli Nov- ember 1889, previously quoted) decided a few months ago that it was not desirable to provoke a discussion with the Turkish Government as to the extent of its jurisdiction on that coast. Your Lordship is also aware that up till very recently Her Majesty s Indian Government had ^erv strong suspicions that ibn Rashid, the Emir of Nejd, contemplated warlike operations aeainst Oman, and it was feared that this movement would be supported by Ottoman troops from Hassa and Katar. The Ottoman Government has at various times strenuously denied any such intention, and I gather from Colonel Ross's despatch Nn. 372 29tl1 ^ecember 1888, that it was currently reported that the Emir of Jebal Shammer had abandoned is intention of invading Oman. Whether or no Ibn Rashid ever had the intentions imputed to36 him, it is obvious that the chronic state of hostility between the Sheikhs of Bidaa and the Chief of Abu Dhabi on the borders of the territories of the Sultan of Maskat ofiords a tempting opportunity to the Sultan of Turkey to extend his authority and garrisons on the coast line in the direction of Maskat. ' 129. The views of the Secretary of State (Lord Cross) were asked on this matter. Lord Cross replied that in his opinion the Imperial interests would he prejudiced if the general question of the extent of the Turkish jurisdiction on the Arabian Coast of the ^Persian Gulf were raised with the Forte, and that it would be sufficient if Sir W. White was instructed to remind the Tur kish Government that Her Qovemment could not view with indiff erence any attempt on the part of the Turkish authorities at interference or aggression in Oman. 130. This view, Sir W. White, was directed by the Foreign Office tocom- secret e ., september 1889, nos, 382-284. municate to the Turkish Government. Intrigues of Jasim against Abu-Thabi, 1889-90. 131, Sheikh Jasim's projected expedition against the Chief of Abu Thabi external a, september 1889, nos. 100-106. had apparently ended without sny favour- , . ... . . a W e result. He now sought to establish friendly relations with the Sheikhs of the Oman coast and induce them by bribes in the shape of money and horses to make a combination against the Chiefs of Abu Thabi and the Chief of Debai who had joined him in the recent hostile External a, January 1890, No. 1213. movements. In November 1889, it was re* Eitemai a , February 1890, Ncs. 69-70. ported that Jasim had despatched horses External A, December 1889, Nos. 105-lt6. rjo rwooanfa n rp,-,^i,• l, i . . ..

Jasim also maintained intimate relations with Ibn Rashid and exchanged presents with that Chief, by sending pears, carpets, Martini-Henri rifles and camels in return for horses. The emissaries of Ibn Rashid openly proclaimed every where that Ibn Rashid and Jasim were one and that who soever disobeyed the latter would incur the displeasure of the other. 132. The Wali of Basrah made an attempt at a reconciliation between external a., january i89o, Nos, 9 .11. Sheikhs Jasim and Zaid, He wrote to him in October 1889 alluding to the following points :—(i) The bond of the common religion which should connect the Sheikh and bis people with the Turks; (2) the latent sovereignty of the Sultan of Turkey over the Arab States, which other powers (the Eritish) sought to take away • (3) the saving of the strife and bloodshed, by submitting their disputes to the irorte and not to other powers. Sheikh Zaid under the advice of theTolitical Resident replied (November 1889) that so long as Sheikh Jasim abstained from aggressive movements, it was Sheikh Zaid's wish and intention to confine him- sgIi to tliG maintenance and. protection of his own territories. 3^3.

Another expedient, Sheikh Jasim sought, in order to strengthen his position under the aegis of the Turkish Government, was to discredit the British Extrenal A, March 1890, Nos. 17-18. Government in the eyes of Arabs. He , C1 , , ^ , wrote in December 1889 to the Chief or bhargah to say that— ' The French Government have ensted the British Army from Cairo and the Turkish Government will shortly exercise influence over this sea (Persian Gulf) and its littoral.' 135. Sheikh Jasim seemed often in a mood to self efface himself in order to External A, March 1890, Nos. 296-297. proclaim the rule of the Turks in Katar. , , , , , . , , Earl y in the year 1890, he is reported to have caused it to be proclaimed that the administration of the country was in37 the hands of the Turks and the Turkish Kazi. At the same time we learn that he issued a proclamation at Bidaa forbidding the entry there of the Almurah and Monasir tribes. The prohibition against the former was said to hare been dictated by the Mutasarrif of Hasa and against the latter by the enmity of Jasim towards Sheikh Zaid. 136. Soon after this, efforts were made by the Chief of Bahrein at the External a., May i89o, Nos. 114-126. instance of the Political Resident, to bring about a reconciliation between Sheikh Jasim and the Chief of Abu-Thabi since their disputes were a continuous source of political unrest on the Arab coast. The Chief of Bahrein went so far even as to proceed in March 1890 to Katar to meet Sheikh Jasim, and the latter External a..

On the 23rd September 1890, Colonel Ross telegraphed to Simla:— ' It is reported that Turkish authorities intend, establishing posts at ZobaraK and Odeid on Kaiar coasts, and have nominated Mudirs. I venture to recommend that Government cause immediate enquiry and Turkish Government be informed of British views, Odeid is distinctly considered within our zone of influence as appanage of Abu-Thabi. If settlement once formed under Turkish influence; it would be difficult to obtain withdrawal by diplomacy. Matter is urgent/' 138. The Government of India in repeating this message to the India No. 77 of 1890. Office recommended the proposed com munication being made to the Turkish Government. 139. The India Office in writing on this subject to the Foreign Office on No. si of 1890. 2n(i observed ' In accordance with the recommendation of the Government of India, Lord Cross desires to suggest, for the consideration of the Marquis of Salisbury, that Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople be instructed to make enquiries of the Porte as to whether any movement of the nature indicated is contemplated, and in that case to require the Turkish Government to abandon the intention of occupying a port which is viewed by Her Majesty's Government as a dependency of Abuthabi. Zobarah lies on the western side of the northern extremity of the Katar peninsula. It will be seen, on reference to this office letter of the 2nd November 1888, that it is questionalle vhtther any remonstrance should be made against a Turkish occupation of this place. Her Majesty's Government have declined to admit the claim of Turkey to sovereignty over the Kafar coast, but they have never protested against the presence at Bidaa, on the eastern side of the Katar peninsula, of the Turks who have maintained a small military port there since 1872.' 140. In January 1891 rumours reached the Residency Agent at Bahrein secret e ., March i89i, Nos. 91-105. that three officers had been appointed at Hasa—one an Assistant to Jasim-bin- Thani, the second Governor of Zobarah, and the third as Governor of Odeid, and that 400 soldiers would soon arrive for garrisoning the two towns. As the Chief of Bahrein felt very uneasy on hearing of these proceedings, the Government of India enquired of the India Office whether the Porte was being pressed for a reply. The answer was in the affirmative. Hostilities between Sheikh Jasim and the Turks, 1891-1893. 141. In February 1891 we discover the first grave symptoms of disagree- Secret E., July 1891, Nos. 178-194. ^ ie Turkish authorities and bheikh Jasim, which soon developed into open hostilities. The following translation of the report of the Residency Agent at Bahrein, dated the 20th Tebruary 1891, explains the causes and points of difference between them :— &lt;f After compliments—I have the honour to report that frequent news reaches me about the projected rebuilding of Zobarah and Odeid. Two days ago a boat from Wakrah arrived he;e38 the Naklioda o£ which stated that Jasim-bin-'Thani proposed io\ihe Knleysaut tribe of Wah-ah that they should go and reside in Odeid, promising to stand by them for good and evil. The tribe which number 40, all told, replied that they were willing to accede to the proposal, provided that one of Jasim's sons was appointed to be the Chief, to whom they could refer all matters concerning them. But they refused to settle at Odeid under a Turkish, Officer* It appears, however, that there is a divergence of opinion on the subject amongst the tribe itself. It is stated that the Turkish Officers are urging Jasim to rebuild Zoharah and Odeid and to establish customs at Bidaa. Jasim, however, is excusing himself ou the ground that it is first necessary to decide the question as to who is goinc; to settle at Odeid, and the question of administrating it must be discussed afterwards. But as to the establishment of customs at Bidaa, Jasim is reported to have observed that the inhahitantt will abandon the •place as soon as the measure is enforced. The officers are reported to have observed that they had nothing to do with the consequences, and that they would carry out the measure whether he liked it or not.^ Mahammad-bin-Abdul Wahab has returned to Bahrein and states that he has received a letter from Jasim-bin-Thani in which the latter mentions that he has tendered his resignation to the Wali of Basra, as Kaim Makam of Kztar, observing that the assistant who has been sent would be sufficient for the post, The application for resignation is stated to be couched in terms of resentment at the appointment of the Assistant Kaim Makam.' 142. It was reported in April 1891, that Jasim's resignation referred to in the report of the Resident about Bali- External A., July 1891, Isos. 128-132. • . j. J 'U xi , rem was not accepted by the Wall of Basra and that be was told to work with zeal and to discbarge the duties be had performed before. 143. The breach however between the Turks and Jasim was widening Movements of the Turks against Jasim, every day, as he seems to have still 1893. persisted in opposing the Turkish scheme for a custom house at Bidaa, and in March 1892, reports were received that nine- hundred infantry and one hundred cavalry were about to be sent from Basra, „ „ , 0rt „ „ by sea to Hassa. Other Turkish forces Secret E., May 1892, Nos. 46-65. ■. i. j i. i • i. i were also reported to be movmg towards Bidaa. 144. In February 1893, the Wali of Basrah himself proceeded by land to Encounters between Jasim's and Tur- Bidaa. On his arrival Sheikh Jasim did kish forces, 1893. not visit him. He was encamped at a place about 8 hours distant from the sea and 3 days' journey from Bidaa. The Wall of Basrah wrote to Sheikh Jasim giving assurance of safety and inviting him to a conference. Jasim sent his brother, Ahmed to the Wali, under a guarantee of safety from the latter, to settle matters. As Ahmed could not succeed in his mission, the Wali insisted on Jnsim himself coming. But the latter fearing lest the Wali should confine him, deputed his brother again with a few followers. The Wali answered only by confining Ahmed and the followers. Jasim thereupon seemingly dispersed his forces, but actually distri buted them over various points of vantage, and gave out that he was going to flee to a place called Wajbah. Turkish troopers mumbering 160—were sent after him, but only to be entrapped and surrounded. A large number of them were killed. 144-A. This action took place about the 3rd of April 1893. About the middle of .April—when the whole force under the Wali marched against Sheikh Jasim's force—there was a fierce encounter, in which both sides sustained heavy losses. An armstice was thereupon agreed to for settling their disputes. Eeconciliation between Turks and . ^ June news was received that an Jasim, who resigns 1893. interview was brought about between Secret E., J.nuarj 1 8 9 3, No., 14.«. tlle ^ Sh ei kh Jasim . 88 a result of which, the following settlement was arrived at:— (1) Sheikh Jasim was to resign his position of Kaim Mukam in favour of his brother Ahmed, through whom in future the revenue was to be paid.

A few days before the first action (above described) was fought, Sheikh No. 140 of secret e ., July 1898, nos. 124-231. Jasim addressed letters k) the Political Re sident and the Chief of Bahrein appealing for British protection and that of the Chief of Bahrein, and applying for permis sion to reside in the northern part of Katar within the latter's jurisdiction. The Political Resident proposed to reply that the British Government could not allow the Chief of Bahrein to shelter an avowed enemy of the Turkish Government, a friendly power, and Sheikh Jasim was debarred by previous orders of Govern ment from settling either at Zobarah or Odeid, which places the Shiekh had Secret e., July 1893, No. 169. evidently in view in which to settle. Jasim also wrote to Sheikh Zaid, Chief of Abu-Thabi, his old enemy, praying him to let by-gones be by-gone and to appoint him a place for residence, hinting probably at Odeid. The Resident proposed that the Chief should reply in the same terms as those proposed in the reply to the application to the Chief of Bahrein and to himself. These replies were probably never sent, for when the correspondence on the subject was going on, two actions had taken place, as a result of which the Turks had to agrea to an armistice for negotiating with Jasim, 147. While these events were occurring in Katar, the British Ambassador at British intorventioD, 1893. Constantinople (Sir E. 0. Ford) seems to have made enquiries from the Turkish ^ Noh . 172-173 of secret e ., July 1893, Nos. 124- Minister for Eoreign Affairs in the matter, and was told that the Wali of Basrah had gone to Katar, that an encounter had taken place and several lives had been lost, and that the Turkish Government contemplated despatching troops to the spot. The Minister maintained that Katar paid tribute to the Suitan. The British Ambassador communicated the facts to the Poreign Office in London, and it was then suggested by Lord Rosebery that Colonel Talbot might be deputed to the spot, or he might send some other officer there, to enquire into the dispute and arrange for a settlement between the Turkish authorities and Sheikh Jasim 148. The Government of India then under instructions from the Secretary of No. i3i of secret e., july 1693, Nos. 124-131. State J or India despatched Lieutenant- Colonel Talbot (Resident at Bushire) to the Katar coast for the purpose. The Porte was also informed by the Foreign Office of this movement. On arriving at Bidaa Colonel Talbot interviewed the Wali of Basrah and Sheikh Jasim at Wakrah, the result of which interview he telegraphed on the 5th May 1891:— Wali at Bedaa declined discussing question without orders from Ottoman Porte and No. 166 Of secret E., July 1893, Nos. 124-131. Protested agamst my action until their receipt. Hear later of his dismissal, and that Nahib was still at Bassorah. Further delay was useless, so I interviewed Jasim two days at Wakrah. He gave paper authorising his brother Ahmed to settle question, and latter wrote acceptino- just arrangement by me, and asked for place of refuge on Katar coast other than Zobarah or J3idaa when he would renew treaty of 1868 on the same terms as Trucial Chiefs. It is also verbally understood that although considering himself the injured party, Ahmed would pay maximum indemnity of Rs. 20,000 for Turkish losses if demanded. Jasim and Ahmed solicited earliest possible settlement so as not to lose pearl season, now at stand-still from fear of Turks. Bidaa is at present deserted by Arabs, and will remain so unless their safety is assured. It would thus be useless to the Turks, and I strongly recommend effort beino- made to procure their withdrawal and reinstatement of independent Katar Chiefs on footing of Trucial Chiefs. Even though Turks should condone Jasim's action for the present in order to avert our mediation. I believe they would be willing to pay small annual instalment not exceedincr kerans nine thousand to clear off any reasonable lump sum demanded by the Turks for cession of supposed rights at Bidaa and withdrawal from Katar.40 149. This telegram was repeated to the Secretary of State for orders. Tke No. 178 of secret e ., july 1893, Nos. 124,-131. reply of the Secretary of State dated 18th May was as follows a I have suggested withdrawal o£ Turkish establishment on the basis of offer of Chief, India undertaking to guarantee for periodical payment of instalment of indemuity agreed upon.

Referring to this correspondence and India Office telegram dated i o{Do 18th May referred to above; His Excel lency the Viceroy telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of State:— ' Colonel Talbot has telegraphed on 23rd May as follows -.—Begins. The interests of the Guttar Pearl Fishery and Bahrein trade depend on peaceful and durable settlement with Jasim. If Porte will promise this as essential to the future peace of the Guttar coast, it might be sufficiently satisfactory. If promise declined and expedition threatened, I suggest Porte be warned that Jasitn will be protected by us in some Guttar port other than Bidaa. JLnds. It is hoped that the view of the Turkish Ambassador as set forth in the enclosure to the letter of the India Office, dated 21st April, that Katar is a Turkish Sub-Governorship and dependency of Nejd has been formally dissented from.' 153. A telegram was thereupon sent by the Foreign Office to the British x- -...o Ambassador at Constantinople enquiring Secret E., January 1894, ^os. 14-43. , xi j / i &lt;• t/. Z 5 whether the despatch of an expedition to the interior of Katar was contemplated. The enquiries elicited the information that no such expedition was contemplated, as the disputes with Sheikh Jasim had been settled. As regards the Turkish Ambassador's note of April 15th it was pointed out by the Foreign Office (letter dated 24th June 1893), that the note was communicated informally to Lord Rosebery, that His Lordship was therefore not inclined to reply officially to it, but that he would take an opportunity of reminding Rustam Pasha privately of Lord Granville's decla ration of 7th May 1883 refusing to admit the claims of Turkey to the Katar coast. 154. In their letter No. 141 (Secret—External), dated 11th July 1893, ht nnn isc t, iqoq 'nt toioqt the Government of India wrote as follows No. 229 of Secret E., July 1893, Nos. 124-231. j. ji a , c oj j to the Secretary of State :— it Your Lordship is already aware that the Ottoman Porte has of late distinctly asserted its claims to sovereignty over Katar; and we have now only to invite attention to the late ^proceedings of the local Turkish officials in forbidding Captain Streeten of Her Majesty's ship Brisk ^ from holding torpedo practice in the harbour of Bidaa, and in preventing our officers from visiting the shore. We take this opportunity of enquiring whether the policy laid down in 1883 of denying Turkish jurisdiction over Katar should be continued. The Government of India are not aware of any circumstance which would justify a departure from it in the present state of affairs in the peninsula. We should, therefore, recommend that the line of action hitherto adopted by Her Majesty's Government may continue to be followed; and we have, at the game time, the honour to state that the proceedings of the local Turkish authorities have caused and are still causing injury to the trade of Bahrein.' * See paragraph 15S post.41 155.

So long as they do not move beyond the limits of the town, the nominal suzerainty of the Forte is recognized) hut any attempt to extend Turkish authority is resisted. There seems therefore to le no sufficient reason for allowing the pretensions of Turkey to interfere with our liberty of action, or to prevent Your Excellency 1 s Government from maJcing such treaties xoith the Chiefs of Katar as may be considered desirable. Her Majesty's Government maintain the policy hitherto followed, and continue to deny the claim of the Turkish Government to exercise sovereignty over the Katar Peninsula but they do not think it necessary to make any official communication on the subject to the Porte, unless the question is raised officially by the Turkish Government. 156. In December 1893 a question was raised by the Naval Commander-in- 0 -.0,^ ^ x- rr Q Chief to the Officiating Political Resident, Secret E,May 1894, Pro. Noi. 558-669. ^ . /-i in /mr n c « Persian Gulf, (Mr. Crawford) whether Her Majesty's ships of war were or were not to recognize the Turkish rule at Bidaa. The question arose out of the objection of the Turks to the recent visit of His Majesty's ship ' Brisk ' to Bidaa and to the proposal of the Commander to hold torpedo practice in what was claimed to be Turkish waters. The matter _ - on ^ to vt « was referred to the Government of India Secret e, May 1894, Pro. No, ^ ^ directed __ (Ijettel .

The Governor- General in Council is, however, desirous that British Naval Officers should avoid giving Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting by overt action such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in that locality and considers that Her Majesty's ships should refrain from visiting the harbour of El-Bidaa, except when special occasion for doing so arises.' 157. The Secretary of State approved of these instructions, which would have the effect of preventing any conflict of jurisdiction between British Naval » i n y, &gt;T Officers and Turkish Officials at Bidaa, Secret B.

In March 1894, the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, reported the removal of the British flag from a British Secret e., may 1894, Noa. 570 -575. Indian owned vessel, while she was at anchor in the port of Bidaa. The Nakho- da's story was that on entering the port he hoisted the flag as usual, whereupon three Turkish soldiers came on board and the flag was hauled down. Being taken before the Commandant of the Turkish troops at Bidaa, the Nakhoda ex plained that the boat belonged to British subjects and that her certificate and flag were also British. The flag was then restored to the Nakhoda. The Poli tical Resident visited Bidaa in the Sphinx to enquire into the matter. The Commandant at Bidaa, however, declined to furnish any explanation of the matter to the Resident, whom he referred to superior Turkish authority at Basra. 159. The Turkish Commandant informed the Resident at the same time that his visit to Bidaa in the Sphinx in order to obtain an explanation of the occurrance was irregular. As from the statement made by the Nakho-42 da, it appeared that the Turkish Commandant, upon receiving an assurance that the boat was owned by a British Indian subject, ordered the flag to he returned to the Nakhoda, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to take no further action in the matter, as the result of pursuing it further would probably have been to elicit from the Com mandant's superiors an assertion of the Porte's jurisdiction at Bidaa, and the Oovemment of India desired to avoid giving occasion for such pretension. 160, When the facts were reported by the Consul at Basrah to the Secret E, ju!, i8 94 , No., 12M81. fj}} ^ reived on 24th May 1894, denying the alleged lowering of the flag, and giving assurances of the Turkish friendship for the British.

This support was considered to be a menace to Bahrein. 162. A warning was addressed to Sheikh Jasim that this would not be allowed. The Resident reported, however, that a Turkish official, the Mutessarif of Hasa, had gone to Zobarah, and that the settlement was being pushed on, Sheikh Jasim acting in concert with the Mutessarif, who was preparing to hoist the Turkish flag. 163. Un report of the facts to the Indian Office, Her Majesty's Ambassa dor at Constantinople was instructed to call the attention of the Turkish Gov ernment to the matter, and to state that [the formation of a settlement at Zobarah would constitute a menace to Bahrein, and that if the proceedings complained of were allowed to continue, the Government of India would be compelled to take measures for the protection of the Chief of that island. 164. After the lapse of a sufficient interval, Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' commanded by Captain Pelly proceeded to Zobarah and desired Sheikh Sultan to return with his tribe to Bahrein. The Sheikh absolutely refused to comply with this order, and seven of the boats were therefore seized. A Turkish offi cial, appointed the Mudir of Zobarah by the Porte, protested generally, claim ing Zobarah as Turkish territory, and the Al-bin-Ali as having come under Turkish protection. 165. On the 15th July Her Majesty's ship Sphinx seized nine boats to gether with Salim, an important lAl-bin-Ali, who had become reconciled 'with the Bahrein Chief, but the Bahrein boats sent for Salim's family were detain, ed by the new Turkish Mudir at Zobarah. 166. The Resident subsequently reported that the Al-bin-Ali had become reconciled with the Chief of Bahrein, but the Mudir was interferino-, that he claimed the Al-bin-Ali tribe settled at Zobarah, as Turkish subjects and' declared Bahrein unconditionally, and Katar in part, as within the Ottoman dominions, rr x-? he ? e ? ideut 1 f urther reported that the Mutessarif had collected a force at Katif, and that, although he stated that it was for the purpose of an expedition into Nejd, apprehensions were felt that an attack on Bahrein was in contempla- tion. These apprehensions were strengthened by the fact that Sheikh Jasim had collected a large number of boats. The Turkish boat Zuhaf was also found cruising along the Katar coast. 167.

TV ritten warning was conveyed to Jasim in the afternoon and after one hour the Pigeon and opened fire and destroyed forty-four dhows. On the morning of the 7th September, the Turkish officials and flag were no longer at Zobarah. Jasim fl«w flag of truce and wrote offering to surrender, begging for pardon and stating that the Mutasarrif had ordered the collection of boats. Terms offered by Captain Pelly were Al-bin-Ali to evacuate Zobarah and return to Bahrein ; (2) restoration of the Bahrein boats and (3) dispersal of the Bedouins, Jasim pleaded that he had no desire to oppose and accepted the terms. 174 j . The results of the operations undertaken were thus found to be Secret E., March 1896, Nos. 193.20a. ver y satisfactory. About forty-four of the Arab dhows were destroyed and several others captured. Zobarah was abandoned by the Turks, and a large44 number of the Ali-bin-Ali had returned to their allegiance to the Sheikh of Bahrein, while Sheikh Jasim begged for forgiveness. 175. In reporting the part played by Jasim in these disturbances, (letter No. 110, dated 19th October 1895) the Political Resident (Colonel Wilson) Action against Sheikh Jasim, 189 5. expressed the opinion that he had been the No 196of ditto. chief instigator of them, and that he had rendered himself liable to exemplary punishment. The Government of India therefore decided that Jasim should be compelled to pay a fine of Es. 30,000, or if he failed to pay this fine, his boats Govemment of India letter No. 68-E., dated irth u i, i i. i January 1896, No. 200 of Secret E„ March 1896, Should DedeStrOyed.

As regards the captured boats of Sheikh Sultan, they were ordered to be made over to Sheikh Esa, Chief of Bahrein, to make use of as he pleased, unless this course would be likely to involve him in fresh complications. In that case the heirs of Sheikh Sultan were to be given the option of purchasing his boats, within a specified time of the receipt of this offer. 177. The Chief of Bahrein decided to make them over to the heirs of Sheikh Sultan. Sheikh Jasim refused to turedtaisae 11 taken 08 t0 bcats 0ap ' P a y the 11110 of 30,000 on the ground secret e , august 1896, Noa. i -2, that he had nothing to do with the affair. The Political Resident therefore requested Commander Story to allow the Albu Gowarah tribe, to whom some of the boats, (lv in number) captured from Jasim belonged to redeem them. Their value was estimated at Rs. 10,h00, and they were allowed to be redeemed for Rs. 6,386. The other boats also were offered to be redeemed, so that Rs. 10,191 were recovered by this method. Three boats, the property of Bahrein subjects, were released without fine, and 88 were burnt. 178. The amount recovered from the tribes was credited to the Imperial ,, „ revenues, (1) as there was no particular Government of India letter No. 1163-e, A., dated i j t , • 25th June 1886. individual who had,suffered any direct m- No .i8 of secret e., August 1896, Nos. 1-21. jury by the late disturbances, and the effect was a benefit to the general public, and (2) as Government had incurred heavy expenditure to restore order and establish security for a free trade around the islands of Bahrein. 179.

' In reply to Your Excellency's note, I beg leave to remind you of what is stated in regard to the position of Bahrein and Zobarah in the memorandum which was communicated to Your Excellency's predecessor on the 23rd of August of last year. 'Her Majesty's Government adhere to the view expressed in that memoran dum. They consider that the measures in question were necessary for the defence oj Bahrein, which is under the protection of Great Britain, and they cannot admit the contention that the portion of the coast of the Persian Gulf in which Zoharah is situated is within the jurisdiction of the the Ottoman JBpimre.'Arab rising in Katar—1898. 181. Jasim-bin-Thani comes into prominence again in 1898, when he seems to have taken a leading part—though Secret e, Norember 1898, Nos. 515-523. probably a secret one—in an Arab rising in Katar against the Turks. On the 23rd April 1898, the Assistant Political Agent, Basrah, received the news that Sheikh Mubarak Sabah of Koweit, had led an attack a few days previously against the Hawair tribe of Bedouins, who were under the protection of Jasim-bin-Thani, and after defeating them had captured a large number of cattle. This was resented very much by Jasim and his Arabs, and as they suspected that Sheikh Mobarik had acted under Turkish support, they had a quarrel with the Turkish soldiers in Katar. A free fight then ensued between the Arabs and the soldiers, and it was even said that the Turkish garrison was attacked by Jasim. 182. The commander of the Sphinx, who was on his way from Bushire to Karachi, was then requested to call at Bidaa and report the facts, which so far as could be gathered on a short visit by Lieutenant Eobinson to the shore appeared to be as follows :— To go some time back, Hafiz Pasha, Valiof Basrah, about 5 years ago, came with gun boats and bombarded the town (Bidaa). This was No. 523 of Secret E, November 1898. owing to Jasim-bin-Thani raising the Arabs to 1^08.515-523. resist and attempt to turn out the Turks. Thig acounts for the very dilapidated state of a considerable portioa of the town visible from the harbour. For some considerable time previous to this, it has not been the custom to keep a gun-boat at this place constantly, but there was usually one stationed either at Bidaa or Katif. Some 3 months ago, tbe Sheikh of Koweit made an excursion to punish the Beni Haiar tribe for repeated acts of robbery; Jasim-bin-Thani mixed himself up in this affair, in so far, as he complained to the Turks that the Sheikh of Koweit had taken, amongst the spoils from the Beni Hajar, certain property that belonged to him. The Turks, however, refused to interfere, and it is supposed that this caused him to become disaffected to the Turks. About two months ago, during the temporary absence of the gun vessel, a rising of the Arabs took place, in which a few on either side were killed ; it could not be ascertained who led the Arabs. In consequence of this the garrison has been strengthened, and it is now rumoured to amount to 800 men, and it is also believed that some field-pieces were brought from Basrah. In reading this report it should be distinctly remembered that tbe small amount o£ information that could be gained from the Turks was not reliable, owing to their natural distrust of our movements, and that from the Arab source was restricted in extent owing to the little communication that appears to go on between the two communities. It is, I understand, the intention of the Turks to keep a gan-boat constantly at Bidaa, and it was ramoured that the Turkish Government meditates strengthening their fleet in these waters. Jasim-bin-Thani has not been living in the tow r n for some considerable time, and was re ported to be about 9 hours' journey inland. I may note here that, whenever this man's name was mentioned, there appeared a great reserve concerning him and a great disinclination to talk about him. The Turks, it is said, have confiscated his property in the town, his brother Ahmed Hn-Thani lives in the town and is practically the Arab Governor ; be was very civil to Lieutenant Robinson. Yusuf-bin-Rahim, the brother-in-law of the Sheikh of Koweit, has, I take it, influenced affairs in this direction to a certain extent ; he has plenty of money, and is constantly intriguing against Mubarak of Koweit, and having joined with Jasim, the latter is naturally influenced. Yusuf left in a dhow about 10 years ago for Lingah in order to proceed by steamer to Bombay where he has much business. An item of information which may be useful to show the way the wind is veering, is that an influential family, consisting of Muhammad-bin-Subab, Mubarak-bin-Athba and Muham mad -bin Jarra, have had their property confiscated by the Turks since the last conflict, and they have fled and sought protection from the Emir of Nejd, and Ahmed has hopes that hey may induce the Emir to assist them against the Turks. My general impression is that the Turks maintain merely a defensive or even a passive occupation of the place, and their tenure is only relied on by the presence of the gunboat. No attempt whatever has been made to improve the fortification of the fort or to repair its many dilapidations. . They appear to be mainly dependent for their provisions and supplies upon Basrah. They do not seem in any way to interfere with the government of the town outside the fort, which is left in the Arabs' hands ; nor do they apparently mix with the Arabs to acy great extent*46 The yoke, therefore, on the Arabs' neck appears light, and, with a fair amount of cohesion amongst themselves, could, for a period at any rate, be easily thrown off, so long as a proper opportunity was taken. The effect caused by the presence ot one of Her Majesty's ships was to the Turks that of embarrassment, to the Arabs a certain amount of encouragement/' Ahmed in a private interview with Lieutenant Eobinson stated it was their wish to turn out the Turks, and they would he pleased to enter into the same treaties with the British Government as have the Trucial Chiefs. He was, of course, distinctly told that he must not think of the British Government interfering initially, but that his views would be forwarded by me for any future consideration the Government might see fit to take, in the event of his being successtul in his endeavour to substantiate himself over the Turk. Jit really seems as if Jasim had given up any further active measures, and that his brother had taken iip the reins. lu concluding this portion of my report, 1 think I may state that the matter of my procedure in order to obtain all available information did not give the Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in this locality. 183. No action appears to have been taken on this report. The offer of Ahmed-bin-Thani to place himself under the British protection was noticed neither by the Political Resident nor by the Government of India. Disturbances off the Katar coast between the Amamera and Al-bin-Ali tribes—1900. 184. In his letter, No. 269, dated the 19th November 1900, Lieutenant- Colonel C. A. Kemball reported that a disturbance had taken place on 86 of Secret E., April 1901NO, 83.93.| ° r f b , 0Ut ^ June at Sea off ^atra, and stated as follows :— &lt;£ About the date mentioned five boats belonging to men of the Amamera tribe of Bahrein who were engaged in diving for pearls, were driven southwards by stress of weather and forced to take shelter near El-Wakra, where the fleet of the Al-bin-Ali were engaged, in company with other boats from Katar, in pearl diving operations. 11 Al-bin-Ali, between whom and the Amamera a blood-feud exists, recoo-nized the boats of the Amamera. They hoisted their flags and set sail towards them. The^Amamera thinking that the Al-bin-Ali boats intended to attack them, fired some shots, on'which the Al- bin-Ali boats cleared off, and the Amamera then being still doubtful of the intentions of the Al- bin-Ali and finding themselves in a trap, besought Saleh-bin-Muhammad, a nephew of Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani, to mediate. At his suggestion, the Amamera handed over their arms consisting of some 20 rifles and a sword, and were tben allowed to go. Shortly afterwards the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein received a letter from the Al-bin-Ali in which they stated that two of their men bad been killed and 15 wounded by the fire of the Amamera, who were the aggressors. This report appeared to be devoid of truth but the Assistant Political Agent replied to the letter and called upon the Al-bin-Ali to surrender the arms which they had taken, and to furnish him with the names of the persons alleged to have been killed and wounded. These names were in due course furnished and the Assistant Political Agent then called upon the Ali-bin-Ali to send some of the wounded persons to Bahrein for examination. The Al-bin-Ali excused themselves from doing this on various pretexts, and the result of subsequent enquiries, made by the Assistant Political Ao-ent through the Chief of Albu Gowara, many of whose tribesmen witnessed the occurrence does not confirm the statement that any of the Al-bin-Ali were killed or wounded. They have given up the arms, which, they say, were taken by them, though the Amamerk allege that two rifles are still missing and that the majority of the arms returned are not those which were taken. ' The Assistant Political Agent is of opinion, and his conclusions appear to me to be correct, that the Al-bin-Ali were the aggressors and responsible for the disturbance Seein'- their enemies driven into their midst and apparently at their mercy, they thoucrht it a fit opportunity to take their revenge for the murder of their former Sheikh Sultan bin Salama The Amamera apparently only acted in self-defence, and it seems very probable that if it bad not been for the intervention of Saleh-bin-Muhammad, the disturbance would have ' had serious results. ^ ' The Assistant Political Agent suggests that a fine of Rs. 1,000 should be imposed on the Al-bin-AU as a punishment for having provoked a breach of the peace, and that a further fine of Us. 600 should he taken from them on account of their having substituted inferior sruns for those taken by them from the Amamera. 8 ui //he ciroumstanoes connected with the murder of Snltau-bin Salama and consequent No SB W lt1 W i e 2 e t h M TV koo j 6 J V namera were re P orted hy Meade in his letter No 26, dated mh March 1899 and it seems to me that, as apparently no satisfactory settlement of this blood-feud has been arrived at between the parties, the Al-bin-Ali in accordance with Arab custom, could not well avoid seizing the opportunity which presented itself of taking their revenge on the Amamera. Tney were obliged, it seems, a t Ly rate47 to feign an attack on tberaor they would have been considered faint-hearted in the eyes of other Arabs. I do not, however, consider that we are called upon to arrange a settlement of tribal blood-feuds among these Arab tribes. Our policy is to see that peace at sea is preserved, and, as in the present case, a disturbance did cake place, which might have had serious conse quences, I would recommend that the Al.bin-Ali, as the offending tribe, should be punished as suggested by Assistant Political Agent. ,f The Al-bin-Ali are supposed to be under the authority of the Chief of Bahrein, but the offending section, being dissatisfied on account of the murder of their headman, Sultan-bin- Salma, have gone to Katar, and do not acknowledge Sheikh Esa^s authority. They, however, as reported by Assistant Political Agent, have date gardens and a small cargo boat in Bahrein and the Assistant Political Agent recommends that this property should be sequestered until the fines are paid. As the Al-bin-Ali, whn are responsible for the disturbance, reside at Doha, which is situated within the the Bidaa bay, where a i'urkish gunboat is stationed, I am of opinion -that the course suggested may beiadopted, i£ my view as to tha advisability of inflicting a fine on the tribe is appioved by the Government of India/'' Piracies committed by the Beni Hajir off the Katar coast—1900. 185. In the year 1900 four cas^s of piracies were reported to have been committed by the Beni Hajir tribes off the Katar coast (Colonel Kemball'a letter No. 231, dated 10th September 1900). When enquiries were made into the cases, there appeared some doubt Secret E.. NoTember 1900, No. 65. i ii £ n i • • u • whether one of the alleged piracies whicn had been committed on the Persian boat Mubariki, was a case of piracy. The three others were found to have been committed by the same gang, the leaders of which were said to have been Salmin-bin-Yetama of the Shabaween ^section and Abdul-Hadi-bin Mirait of the Fehaid section of the Beni Hur. It was also ascertained that the pirates embarked at Khor Shaggig (a few miles south of Dhakira) which was occupied by the Mehaneda tribe, whose Sheikh at the time was Abdul Aziz-bin-Ali Abdul Aziz. The Political Resident proposed that Sheikh Ahmed should be informed that the Government of India would hold him responsible for the control of the Bedouins who resided in Katar, r and that steps would, if necessary, be taken to bring this responsibility home to him ; and that he should warn all owners of boats residing on the Katar coast that they must be careful not to allow their boats to be used by these Bedouin marauders, as in future the owners of the boatslused by the pirates would beheld responsible (Resident's letter No. 1-70, No. 87 of Secret E-, Apni i9oi f 1*08. ss-Qo. dated 19th November 1900)- ThePoli- tical Resident gave the following reasons for making this suggestion :— ' As to Sheikh Ahmed's ability to restrain the Bedouins residing in Katar and to obtain compensation for the vietims of the piracies, I am unable to express a definite opinion. H s success in recovering a p &gt;rtion of the stolen property would seem to show that if he chose to , exert his authority, he could obtain some further redress, and as Mr. Gaskin points out, he S could probably obtain ample reparation if he chose to seize Salmin and Abdul Hadi, who appear to have been responsible for the piracies. Sheikh Ahmed and Sheikh Jasim, so far as my inquiries go, do not possess any landed property in Bahrein. They, however, have an agent in Bahrein to whom they occasionally send large sums of money for the purchase of rice, while the proceeds of the pearls sent by them for sale to Bombay also come to Bahrein. It would be possible, with the assistance of the Chief of Bahrein, to seize the property belonging to Sheikh Ahmed and his brother which we may be able to lay our hands on in Bahrein and to compensate with it the victims of the piracies. I confess, however, that this proposal does not entirely commend itself to me. It is possible that Sheikh Ahmed's authority throughout Katar may be o£ a sufficiently stable nature to enable him to punish the persons who are i*es- ponsible for the piracies and to recover the stolen property, but I am not thoroughly satisfied that this is the case, and moreover the course suggested, although it would result in the satisfaction of the claims of the persons whose properly was robbed, would not, it seems to me, act as-&gt; deterrent to the pirates for the future. The alternative course would be to send a naval expedition to seize the boats belonging to the place where the pirates embarked for the purpose of committing the piracies in question. A boat expedition would, I understand, be necessary as ships cannot approach within several miles of Khor Shaggig. This proposal, if carried out, would probably have the effect of putting a stop to piracies in the future, as the owners of boats would be careful to see that thev were not taken by the Bedouins for their piratical expeditions. At the same time, it must be remembered that these piracies occurred more than a year ag-o, and, in my opinion, a punitive expedition to be fully effective and to ensure the punishment of the right persons, should be carried out as soon as possible after the occurrence of the piracy. \48 It cannot, howeyer, be said that piracies have of recent years been of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Katar, and during this year only one case appears to have occurred, that reported in my letter No. dated 10th September 1900.^ Reconsideration of our general policy on the Arab coast of the Gulf, 1900-1901. 186. In dealing with these cases reported by Colonel Kemball in his letters Nos. 269 and 270, {vide paragraphs 181 and 185 above) Captain Daly, Deputy- Secretary, pointed out the desirability of obtaining a better hold on Katar and of coming to some permanent arrangement with Sheikhs Jasim and Ahmed, and suggested that the Resident's attention should be directed to these points. ' 1 have no desire,' Captain, Daly wrote, ' to recommend a show of activity which might have embarrassing results, but I do not at present see any reason why a satisfactory modus vivendi with the Katar Sheikhs should not be secured. The position is somewhat complicated by the presence of a Turkish garrison at Bidaa, but we do not admit that the Porte is in eSective occupation of the coast south of Katif, though up to Katif we recognise Turkish jurisdiction. *' As to the particular cases I think we might accept the proposals made in Colonel Kemball's No. 269, provided that there is reasonable expectation of the fines being recovered. But there is evidently no need for haste and, if some arrangement of a permanent character could be made with the Sheikhs, it might be better to exact no punishment for what is past. I think we may also agree generally in the views expressed in Colonel Kemball's No. 270; but here again there is no reason for hurry. The unsatisfactory feature in this latter case is that the demands and threats made in Colonel Meade's letter of 25th November 1899, of which Colonel Kemball sends a copy, can scarcely be conveniently made good. This illustrates the necessity for caution. It seems a pity that Colonel Meade wrote as he did.' 187. He then submitted a draft letter* to be addressed to the Resident, dealing with a variety of matters, which seemed to demand attention in connection with British position at Maskat and on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, and in regard to Katar expressing the above views.* On this the Secretary, Mr. Barnes, noted:— ' I think the general impression given by the draft is that the Government of India desires and intends to adopt a much more vigorous policy all along the Arabian Coast than has hitherto been in vogue, and so lengthy and serious a review gives, perhaps, any change that may be intended rather a more formidable aspect than it deserves. After all the suggestions that are made in the draft, for the Resident's consideration, are not very serious or formidable. It is proposed ••• ••• ••• (II) to endeavour to obtain greater influence and control in Katar.' 188. His Excellency Lord Curzon then minuted :— ' Captain Daly's draft, comprehensive and excellent as it is, must certainly be split up. It could only be regarded in its present form as a mandamus for a forward policy. I will deal with the successive sections « * * • * * • « II. In the case of Katar, there is similar balancing in the draft. We want; ' to obtain a better hold,' but at the same time it is far from our wish to make any show of activity.' We ' do not admit that the Porte is in effective occupation;' but at the same time there is the uncomfortable and complicating fact of the presence of the Turkish garrison at Bidaa. So long as we can give forth no more certain sound than this, I can see no use in issuing fresh instructions. There is nothing in this to prevent our accepting the suggestion made in Colonel Kemball's letters Nos. 269 and 270 of November 1900.' • Vide Appendix B.189. The following reply was accordingly sent to the Besidcnt (No. 284- E-A, dated 19th February 1901) ^ ^ Novemberl900) 'I am directed to reply to your letteis o£ ^ alt wilb a disturbance off the No. 89 of Secret E, April 1901, Nos. 83-90.

But I fear that this is out of the question. ^ ^ to be befo re a definite arrangement'with th^Chief o^Katar is^entered into. For instance, it would be necessary50 to raalfe further enquiries as to the actual position occupied in Katar hj Sheikh Ahmed, His brother Shf-ikh Jasim is the actual Chief so far as the tribes are concerned, but so far as the dealings with the Turks are concerned, he has retired in favour of Sheikh Ahmed. Sheikh Jasimis over 80 years of age, and before any arrangement is made with Sheikh Ahmed it will be necessary to find out more about his position and how the succession to the Chiefshin Will devolve OH Sheikh Jasim's death. Again, the question of the choice of residence in Katai- by the Lhiet with whom we enter into the arrangement will have to be considered. The pro bability is that some other place than Zobarah on the opposite Coast of Katar will be found to be more suitable, on account of the proximity of the pearling banks. I would, therefore ask that this letter may be consiiered merely asanas report submitted for the purpose o informing the Government of India of the wish expressed by Sheikh Ahmed to enter infn relations with the British Government, and I would solicit the'instructions of Government to what action I should take. Meanwhile, I have told the Assistant Political Ao-ent thai there is no objection to his meeting Sheikh Ahmed should the latter visit Bahrein a^ h« talks o. doing shortly for the purpose of seeing Sheikh Esa, and hearing what ho has to say Without, however, making him any promise or offering him any encouragement whatever In conclusion, I would beg to remark that the reference made by Sheikh Ahmed in hi« message to Mr. Gaskin regarding his readiness to co-operate in mattes on thrmainland probably lefers to the murder of Sheikh Salman-bm-Diaij, the cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and his followers. There is little doubt that, if Sheikh Ahmed were assured of our piotection, he could arrange to bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime.' 192 The Government of India submitted Colonel Kemball's proposal for ordei-s^Despatch No. 113, dated 10th July 1902) with the following observa- ' As Your Lordship is aware, the Turks have maintained a garrison at Bidaa on fl.o Katar coast tor over 30 years.

Odeid is regarded as appanage of Abutbabi, and text of our Agreement of J892 with Tmcial Chiefs was I under stand, communicated to Porte—see Godley's letter to Foreign Office of 28th v. arch 1893. Amair is an is north of Katit, and its occupation does not concern us. I sincerely trust that His Majesty s Government will prevent occupation of Zobarah and Odeid which would deal serious ow 0 our whole position m the Gulf and gravely compromise status of Bahrein. With refeience to your Secret despatch 87, dated 5th September 1902. Kemball reports that Jasim- bm-Tham is recognized Chief of Katar, and Turks style him Kaimmakam, though he re pudiates title. His brother Ahmed-bin-lhani is, however, the de facto Chief and regarded as heir to his brother who is over 80 years of age. Ahmed approached Meade about British protection in November lh99 and asked at the same time for permission to occupy Odeid. I think that to prevent Turkish designs it will be wise to enter into agreement with him. But it His Majesty s Government are not prepared to take this step at once, which will perhaps to^ cTiefsbip' ' J might be told that we prefer to wait till he succeeds later on ^ f0i :r ar : d ^ ^ co py o f the above telegraphic correspondence to the foreign Office, the following observations were made by Sir Horace Walnole in his letter dated 4th Eebruary 1903 :— Lord Lansdowne will observe that the Government of India consider it necessary to prevent No. 84 of Secret E., May 1903, Nog. 64-87. a Turkish occupation of Zobarah and Odeid, riikre. .. , ^ , ., . 1116 Go vernment of India are unable to identify bv that name, but it may be possibly identical with Wakra, a coast town situated on the shore of the Katar peninsula between Odeid and Bidaa. With Amair or Abu Ali island thev do not consider their interests to be concerned. Zobarah and Wakra are both situated in the peninsula of Katar where His Maiestv's Uoyerument liave^frequently declared that they do not recognize the sovereignty of the Sultan. In the case of Zobarah, occupation of this point by a settlement under the Turkish flao- in 1895 was considered so prejudicial to the safety of Bahrein that, after an ineffectual protest address ed to the iurkish viovernment, forcible steps were taken to prevent it—see Lord Currie's despatcn No. 520 of the 12th August 1895 and the correspondence with the Turkish Ambassador ending with Lord Salisbury's f December 1896,' t j• 0de [ &lt;i i 0n tl3e 0ther ^ an( ^ arid lias . b8ei } for ^e last 30 years held by the Government of n la to belong to the Chief of Abuthabi, with whom they have maintained direct treaty relations for many years. Neither the existence of a separate and independent Chiefship at Odeid, nor its subordination to Katar, has been ever recognized. In these circumstances, Lord *See paragraph 193 ante. tSee draft note sent to the India Office, Pro. No. 153 in Secret E., February 1897, Nos. 151-158.52 George Hamilton is of opinion that the Porte should be informed again that His Majesty's Government, do not recognise their claim to sovereignty over Katar peninsula, and should be pressed to maintain the status quo in that region : and farther that the Porte should he at the same time warned against talcing any steps to occupy Odeid, which in a appanage of the Chief of Abuthahi, a dependent Chief, with whom His Majesty's Government are in direct treaty relations and that no interference with it can be allowed. Should the maintenance of the st&amp;im in Katar be arranged, Lord George Hamilton apprehends that, for the present, at least, no agreement with Ahmed'bm-Thani will he possible. Should, however, the Porte decline to meet the views of His Majesty's Government, further action will be desirable; and it will be a matter for consideration whether the opportunity offered by the Sheikh's desire to come under British protection should not he turned to account. 198. On the 3rd Marcli 1903, a Turkish officer—named Arabi Effendi arrived at Bahrein from Baghdad, and No. 86 of secret e ., ^ay 1903, Nos. 64-87. stated that he had been appointed Mudir of Zobarah and that his Government proposed to establish guard houses from Zobarah to Ojair, and that another officer, Abdul Karim, expected shortly at Bah rein, had been appointed mudir of Odied. The mudir of Zobarah left for Hasa on the 5th March to receive instructions from the Governor there before proceed ing to take up his post. In reporting these No. 86 of Secret e., may, nos. 64-87. facts by telegram (dated 12th March) Colonel Kemball proposed to send the Sphinx to visit Zobarah and Odeid. His Excellency the Viceroy repeated this telegram to the Secretary of State and proposed to wire to the Resident as follows:— i| Proposal to send Sphinx io Zobarah and Odeid is approved. Landing of Turkish offi cials pending settlement of case should not be permitted. Perseus from Maskat can co operate at Odeid if required. Admiral and Cos informed. Keep them acquainted with course of events.^ 199. The Secretary of State approved of this proposal in telegram, dated t. . t ,nno xr o-, 19th March 1903, and also informed the No. 313 of Secret E., A u gu .t .903. No.. 3.3 -102. Govemrnent of India as f ol l ows ._ ' Sir N. O^Conor was instructed on 20th February to act in accordance with India Office letter of 4th February if active steps were imminent on the part of the Turks. He now reports that without directly raising at present the question of Turkish sovereignty if it can be avoided, he will make representations to the Porte of our objections ta the proposed administrative appointments in El Katar or other alterations of the status quo.' 200. The report referred to in this telegram of Sir N. O'Conor was the _^ 010 following, dated 14th March 1903, 'No. 342 of Secret E., August 19C3, ^os. 313-402. -u' r, ru • t ^ j which discusses the various complicated questions arising from the position of affairs :— 'The question of Turkish sovereignty over Katar promontory has, as Your Lordship is aware and will see from the accompanying memorandum,* been repeatedly the subject of discussion with the Porte, and I am not without hope of succeeding in dissuading them from proceeding with the appointments of Sub-Governors, on the ground that any disturbance of the status quo is impolitic, without having to do more than to remind them of the declarations made by His Majesty's Government on this subject on previous occasions. I confess I see strong objections to basing our representations on the fact that we do not recognise Turkish sovereignty over the coast, as its immediate result will be to provoke the Ottoman Government to reassert, in the most formal and official manner, their claim, as happened in 1891-93 (see memorandum); and if we allow their pretensions to pass with noth ing more than a verbal or written contradiction, we shall rather lave weakened than streng thened our present position. If, on the other hand, we are not satisfied with merely disclaim ing their pretended rights, and the Porte persist in their intentions, we shall be forced to take some definite action which may lead His Majesty's Government further than they in tended, or further than it is necessary or politic to go at present. At any ratf, before taking a step which may raise a very vexed and complicated question, it will, 1 venture to think, obviously be advisable to decide beforehand whether His Majesty^s Government will forcibly prevent the Ottoman Government from establishing any new outward symbols of Turkish sovereignty along the whole west coast of the Persian Gulf to Katif, and, if so, what will be their policy and action in regard to the Turkish military station at Bidaa, which undoubtedly exists and has existed for many years. It may safely be said that at the present moment Ottoman sovereignty over the whole of Arabia is, at the best, a very slender one, and that, in the gradual process of disintegra tion, which is proceeding pretty rapidly, it will become less and less. Is it, under these cir cumstances, in accordance with British interests to hasten this disruption, or even to over- weaken Turkish rule until we have some other to put in its place ? It may be that, in the present instance. His Majesty's Government is prepared, after the death of the ruling Chief *Vide Appendix C.53 4 ♦ • of Katar, to recoornise his brother, Ahmed-bin-Thani, and profit by his friendly disposition to conclude witb him some agreement on the lines of those with the Trucial Chiefs, which will give us a sort of Protectorate or lif-n over the promontory; but until this day arrives, it is not clear to me that we gain anything by formally raisings without absolute necessity, the question of sovereignty, such as it is. I do, however, think it very possible that, by doing so, and by overtly pursuing a policy which, rightly or wrongly, is considered as directed against the iutegrity of the Ottoman Empire, we tncourage another Power to some act of rank aggression which will precipitate developments, and possibly place us, before very long, in a serious and grave predicament. There is no doubt that our action in regard to Koweit has made a very painful impression upon not only the Sultan, but upon many of bis Anglophil subjects, whose weight and influ- ence was a counterpoise to the constant pressure and intrigue of that power, whose object it is to persuade both the Sovereign and his ministers that the interest and salvation of Turkey lies in a close and cordial understanding with them. Besides these few remarks which 1 have made bold to lay before Your Lordship, I beg leave to say that I find some difficulty in clearly understanding the policy proposed by the Government of India in regard to Odeid. On the other hand it is suggested that our warn- ino- to the Porte should ba based on the fact that we consider Odeid as an appanage of the Chief of Abuthabi, an independent Ruler with whom we have Treaty relations, that is to say, that we consider Odeid as independent of the Chief of Katar, while, on the other hand, we appear to be contemplating the contingency of counteracting Turkish designs in Katar by countenancing tae absorption of Odeid by Ahmed-bin-Thani.^ 201. Meanwhile active movements were proceeding in Hasa for estab lishing Turkish administrative units at Zobarah, Wakra and Odeid. _ Abdul J? Karim Effendi, the mudir designate for Odeid, was en route to Bahrein. He was to have gone to Odeid, but as the town was quite desolate he sought some other more convenient place. Arabi Effendi was nominated mudir of Zobarah, and Yusuf Beg was to go to Wakra as mudir (see Political Resident's letter No. 47, dated 23rd March 190o). No. 324 of Secret e., august 1903, Nos. 313-402. was reported that Sheikh Jasim had proposed the establishment of these posts. Colonel Kemball believed that the Turkish authorities had for some time been anxious to get hold of Sheikh Jasim and make him responsible for the recent disorders on Katar. He had therefore, in order to absolve himself from responsibility, recommended the Turks to establish posts at several points in Katar, knowing that the British Government would not view with equanimity any occupation of Zobarah and Odeid and wishing to embroil the Turks with the British Government. 202. On the 23rd April 1903 the Political Resident telegraphed as follows from Bushire:— No. 343 of Do. ' Following telegram sent to Ambassador, Constantinople:— Begins —YusuE Beg, Mudir -designate for Wakra, arrived at Bahrein 21st of April from Hasa. He intends leaving for his post, but will not be able to do so probably for some days. I would suggest that orders ■ \ should be sent by Porte countermanding his appointment. These orders should be sent to him personally at Bahrein, and not through the Wali, Basrah, or Mutessarif, Hasa, which will involve great delay. It is imperative such orders should be sent at once, as if he established himself at Wakra, his removal will be difficult. Ends. I have told Gaskin to endeavour to arrange difficulties in the way of the man obtaining a passage from Bahrein to Wakra, and he probably will have to remain Bahrein for the present, so as there should be ample time for orders from Constantinople reaching him. 5^^ which lately visited Wakra, reports that Turkish flao' flvino- there, but no Turkish officials or soldiers. I understand Turkish flag has been flown there for some years by the Chief of Katar, but the appointment of Mudir there is none the less objectionable.' 203. This telegram was reported on the 25th April to the Secretary of State and the Political Resident was asked by &gt; * No ' 344 of Do ' telegram to report more fully how and and by whom the Turkish flag had been flown at Wakra, and if the Sheikh there admitted Turkish sovereignty. 201 Colonel Kemball telegraphed back on the 27th April as follows: ' Probability is that, after the occupation of! Bidaa, Chief of Katar was told (to) fly Turkish flag, and that it is hoisted when ships No. 346 of Do. are geen&lt; ft.phinx reports no Sheikhs there, but headman of [one group missing) told Commander flag had no political significance. Chief of Katar has, as Government of India know, admitted Turkish sovereignty, but this has never been considered to affect our policy with regard to Katar. Gaskin reports, 24!th April54i Yusuf Beg still at Balirein. He has eleven of the Hasa Governor's men with h'm to assist him at Wakra, and he will probably take soldiers from tiidaa he withdrawn from [sic) Officials for the other places were at Hasa waiting for orders from Constantinople. I have little doubt that Katar Chief, i£ assured of our protection against Turks, would not allow Turkish officials at Wakra.' 205. On the 28tli April 1903, the Political Resident telegraphed 'Following telegram received by me to-day, from Ambassador, Constantinople: Begins. No. 347 of Secret E , August 1903, Noi. 313-402. Grand ^ izier sent orders to the AValij Basrah, yesterday, prohibiting any alteration in the exis ting state of affairs in Katar, and asking for explanation of the reported arrival of Yusuf Beg »t Bahrein. Ends. I have sent following reply by telegram ; Begins. Your Excellency's telegram of 27th April. Would it not be possible that Wali should be told to send necessary orders to Yusuf Beg, Bahrein, by telegraph by my care, Bushire ? I can arrange to forward same by ship-of-war. Unless Wall has already written, his letter cannot reach Bahrein before 21st May, by which date I apprehend man will have left. Ends.' 206. With reference to Government of India's telegram of 25th April, the Secretary of State telegraphed on the 29th April:— ' The Ambassador at Constantinople reports that the Grand Vizier telegraphed on the No. 355 of Do. 27th April not to allow tho s/afus quo in Katar to be in any way disturbed. The Ambassador is now pressing the Grand Vizier to instruct the Wali to send orders to Yusuf through Bushire not to take up the appointment at Wakra. If the Grand Vizier refuses, it will be necessary to take steps to stop Yusaf at Bahrein, and you might at once give such orders as will in case of need make this possible/' 207. On this, the Government of India telegraphed to Colonel Kemball on 1st May ' Your telegram of 28th April. Secretary of State telegraphs that, if Grand Vizier refuse v No. 356. to instr uct Wali to order Yusuf Beg not to take up appointment at Wakra, it will be necessary to take steps to stop Yusuf at Bahrein. Please arrange for his detention there under suitable and honourable conditions, pending further instructions unless he returns to Basrah. 208. These instructions were reported by the telegram to the Secretary of State, who wired back on the 3rd May;— 'I presume that all that is intended is that Yusuf should not be allowed to take ship for Wakra or for any place from which he would make his way there. This I certainly consider to be desirable.' J 109. These orders were duly reported to the Political Resident. But it No. 361 of Do. that Yusuf Beg had succeed ed in leaving Bahrein on the 27th April, and had gone to Wakra. It was reported, however, that the people had turned him out of Wakra and that he returned to Bidaa on the 30th April. The Commander of the Lapwing, which was at Bahrein, was then ordered by Colonel Kemball to proceed to Wakra and make enquiries. 210. On the 9th May Colonel Kemball telegraphed ' Lapwing returned to Bushire bringing news, received by Gaskin and considered quite No. 367 of Do. ^l-bl^that Yusuf has succeeded, by intervention . . ,, vwi m 1 /• \ f ur t ? u- ^ lime «r T 110 feafed if he refused he would get into trouble with the Turks, (in) establishing himselt at Wakra. Under these circumstances Commander decided not to go to Wakra, but returned here at once to report. I am informing O'Conor.' ^ 211. The Viceroy in reporting this news to the Secretary of State on the 10th May said: ' I presume His Majesty's Government will insist on Yusuf's withdrawal.'' 212. The Secretary of State wired back on 15th May ' O'Gonor has been instructed to inform Porte that His Majesty's Government cannot No. 869 of Do. allow Yusuf to remain at Wakra, and that they trust Porte will take steps to withdraw him at once/' &amp; 213. The Secretary of State again wired on the 29th May: 'Sir N. O'Conor is assured that the Turkish Government has no knowledge of Yusuf No. 379 of Do. Beg's appointment, and that they will recall him. In the meantime, if the Resident considers it55 undesirable tliat he should remain at Wakra, even for a short time, and is o£ opinion that under pressure of a British ship o£ war his removal can be effected speedily, without raising local difficulties, this course may be followed. 214. This telegram was repeated to Colonel Kemball, who wired back on the 2nd June:— ' I think it will be much better that Yusuf Beg should be recalled by his own govern' ^ „ „ , „ . , ment and I see no objection to his remaining short No. 381 of Secret E., August 1903, Nos 313-402. .. ■, , J , • &amp; . time longer, so long as ms ultimate removal is achieved. I am writing more fully. Meanwhile, could not Porte be asked to reiterate orders which apparently local authorities are neglecting to obey ? 215. On 15th June the Political Resident wired that Mr. Gaskin wrote on 5th June to say that he had received information, which he believed to be reliable, that Yusuf Beg had left Wakra. 216. In August the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that o ™ oo.Yusuf Be? had been dismissed from his Secret E., May 1904, Nos. 234-293. ^ , ttt 7 i-iii i ji post at Wakra, but had been replaced by Abdul Rahman, son of Jasim-bin-Thani, Sheikh of Katar, under order of the Mutaserrif of Hasa. The information was communicated to the Secretary of State, who agreed that, as Katar was beyond the sphere in which nominal suzera inty of the Porte was recdgnizedby His Majesty's Government, we should object to the appointment by Turkey of any administrative official. The Political Resident was informed accordingly, and on the 21st of September the Consul at Basrah reported that the Wali had instructed the Mutasserif of Hasa to suppress the Mudirate at Wakra, and to revert to the status quo ante. 217. On the 20th September Mr. Gaskin who had been deputed to visit Katar reported that he had interviewed both Jasim and Ahmed. The former stated that his son had been made Sheikh of Wakra five years ago by Sheikh Ahmed ; and though he had heard of the recent action of the Mutasserif of Hasa, he had paid no attention to it, and had left Ahmed to deul with the matter. Mr. Gaskin inferred that be disapproved of the Turks appointing his son Mudir of Wakra. Sheikh Ahmed observed that the Mutassarif was apparently anxious to extend Turkish authority in Katar; and, if he succeeded in his designs, the whole Peninsula would be absorbed by the Porte, and his family would be driven out of the country, as they could not oppose the Turks for any length of time, should they really make up their minds to take over the country and employ force; for this reason, he was very eager to know whether His Majesty's Government would extend their protection over Katar in the event of a peti tion being submitted to them to that effect. The Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, informed him that the discussion of this subject was beyond his pro vince, and consequently could give him no reply. Mr. Gaskin also thought that the influence of the Thani family was likely to decrease in Katar because most the Arabs being pearl divers, who had grown rich by the bounty of Sheikh Jasim, would soon be less dependent upon his bounty. 218. Mr. Gaskin's letter of the 20th September was forwarded to the Secre tary of State with the despatch dated 22nd October 1903. Information having been received, that Sheikh Ahmed wished to come and see His Excellency the Viceroy, while on his tour in the Persian Gulf, His Excellency telegraphed from camp On 10th November— 'I should be glad to know, if possible, before 19th November, whether His Majesty's No 269 of ditto Government have arrived at final decision regard ing British protection for Katar. It is probable that Sheikh Ahmed may come to Bahrein to see me and state his views on 26th November.^ 219. The Secretarv of State telegraphed No. 2740 tto. the 18th November 1903 « His Majesty's Government considers situation governed by last paragraph of letter* to Foreign Office, 4th February 1903, stating that no agreement with Sheikh would be possible if maintenance of status quo was arranged. See enclosure to Secretary's letter No. 7, dated February 6th. In view of compliance of Turkish Government with request for maintenance of status quo by withdrawal of Mudirs appointed to Zobarah and Wakra, His Majesty 's * See paragraph 197 ante.66 Government could mt properly or consistently enter I'nto any agreement with Sheikh having nature o^ protectorate which would constitute departure from ttatu* quo on their part In these circumstances communications t ) Sheikh should be limited to assurances of continued friendship so long.as he abstains from entering into engag-ements with other Powers. O'Conor who has been consulted, does not fear any further attempt at Turkish aggression.' 220. When the correspondence on the subject between the India and For eign Offices and Sir N. O'Conor was received from London, it was found that Sir N. O'Conor had expressed the following opinion in his telegram dated 14)th November 1903:— ' I am more concerned lest other Powers should profit by the increasing weakness of the No. 290 of Secret E., May 1904, No?. 234-393. em P ire extract concessions inimical to our sup- . i m i • i . * ernao y and interests in those regions, than of any further attempt at Turkish aggressr n.' It would be contrary to the spirit of our late representations as to the maintenance of the status quo to make a formal declaration of protection; but whether We are thereby debarred from making an agreement with the Sheikh of Katar in maintenance of the status quo and directed solely to the exclusion of foreign influence, is mutter for consideration.' 221. As regards the Mudirate of Wakra, it appeared that no definite orders had been issued cancelling the appointment of Abdul Hahman. His Excellency the Viceroy, therefore, telegraphed to the Secretary of No. 284 of ditto. State on 20th January 1904, expressing . a ^ 0 P e that His Majesty's Government would press for the actual cancellation of the letter of appointment, which had been issued to Abdul Eahman by the Mutasserif, of which Katar should receive formal intimation. 222. With reference to Mr. Gaskin's opinion* about the wanino- influence of the Thani family in Katar expressed in his letter of 20th September 1903, Colonel Kemball, who was asked to report on the matter, stated in his letter No 33 dated i2th February 1904, as follows :— * * ' I am inclined to doubt if it is the case that the inOnence of the Thani family in Katar is rapidly waning It may however, be less than it was for the reasons exp'ained by the Assistant Political Agent. What these people fear is the extension of Turkish rule over Katar, as they know that they could not resist the Turks for long ; and it is for this reason that the arrangement with His Majesty's Government is desired. If they were assured of the support of the British Government against Turkish encroachments, it is probable that the pos't.on of the family with regard to the tribes in Katar would be strengthened and Sheikh Ahmed wou d have no necessity to appeal for support in asserting his authority over ms own tribesmen J 223. As regards the proposed Protectorate treaty with Sheikh Ahmed-bin- No. 292 of ditto. lhani of Katar, the following despatch . ,, ^ _ (No. 77, dated 31st March 1904) was addressed by the Gorernment of India to the Secretary The decision ujHis Majesty's Government that no agreement should at present be concluded with the Ch.et, appears to have been based on two main considerations, first that such a Convention would constitute a disturbance of the sfatvs quo which, in view of the promise of the Turks to cancel the appointmentsofMudirs in Katar which they had made in violation of the understanding to respect the ?«, was held to be unjustifiable and •econdly, that the influence of S ic.kh Ahmed was on the wane, and that an arrangement with MumS 0Ve ' n UBeCl by the Chief t0 retl,ieve his diminishing With reference to the former objection, we observe thatt His Britannic Mniestv's AmW sador at Constantinople is of opinion that, though the formal declaration of the pro(eor„ra.t„ tnisht be considered contrary to the spirit of our recent representations to the Porte we be justified in making an agreement with the Sheikh, with the object of securing the mainte nance of the position which the remonstrances of His Majesty's Gtovornment have s'o far partiallv preserved, and of excluding the possibility of foreign interference in the future. We concur in Sir Nicolas O Conor s view Wc submit that the action of the Turkish Government and of their local officials has not been such as to require anv excess of forbearance on oor mrt tW more so in that, so far as we are aware, they have tailed to carry oat the undertaking U,' b * the Grand Vizier morethan six months ago that their recent nominee for the Mudirate at ' akr \ sh 7' d Q fo ™ 3 'y be dc P rlve , d of tit's- While we obsorrc that so recently as the 28th December 19^8 Mr Crow reported to Sir Nicolas O'Conor the arrival at Basrah of a battalion intended for the Katar Peninsula At any rate the Turkish Government could hardly ob .t to onr entering into friendly relations w.th the successor of Sheikh Muhammad Jn-S. with whom Colonel Pelly concluded a treaty on 12th September 1869. ' * FiVe paragraph 217 aw^e. ~ t Vide paragraph 220 ante.As will appear from his letter whicli we now enclose, we called for a report from our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf as to the truth of the rumours that the influence of Sheikh Ahmed was diminishing. We agree with the view expressed by Colonel Kemball; and we would add that there is nothing in the history of our relations with the Trucial Chiefs to justify the apprehension that we shall, by renewing our relations with the Thani family^ incur the inconvenient obligations anticipated by His Majesty's Government. The status jmo which His Majesty's Government desire to recognise and maintain includes the withdrawal by Turkey of any claim to administrative control or suzerainty over the Peninsula; and it was contemplated thati provided the Porte accepted the position and promptly withdrew the Mudirs at Wakra and Zobarah, it might be undesirable to enter into any agreement amounting to a Protectorate Treaty with the Sheikhs. The failure of the Turks to act up to their assurances in this matter, coupled with the intelligence received from Colonel Kemball as to the status of the Chief, seems to us to leave His Majesty's Government free to cons der the matter; and we suggest that the time is jnow opportune for concluding an agreement with Sheikh Ahmed substanlially resembling those entered into with the Chiefs of the Southern littoral, including the provision that he should not (1) enter into relations with, (2) receive the representative of, or (3) cede territcry to, any foreign Power. We consider that it is desirable to consolidate such influence as we possess in Katar, with special reference to the question of the Pearl Fisheries in the Gulf, as to which we have recently addressed you. The Katar fisheries were extraordinarily productive in 1903. 224. The further correspondence in hand shows that when Sir N. O'Conor made representations to the Porte, he was assured in March last by the Minister of the Interior tSrat Sheikh Abdul Hahman is merely the head of his tribe, and that as such he exercises a certain amount of local influence, he does not hold the official position or title of mudir or carry out any official duties nor does the Goyernment recognize him in any official capacity. This assurance was considered satisfactory by Lord Lansdowne. The opinion however of Mr. Brodrick was asked on the matter in Sir T. Sanderson' letter dated 18th April. 225. Meanwhile under instructions from. Sir N. O'Conor, Mr. Crow Consul at Basrah, wrote to the Vali of Basrah enquiring whether the appoint ment of Abdul Rahman had been cancelled. The Vali replied on May, 2nd, stating that he had again repeated his instructions to the Acting Mutasarrif of Nejd. The Consul again wrote on May 16th to the Vali and impressed upon him the expediency of immediate compliance with the Porte's orders. It appears that the Vali replied on May 15th. In this reply, however, he did not state that no answer had been received from the, Mutasarrif. The Consul thinks that the reply is evasive and that there was ample time for the notifica tion cancelling the appointment to issue. 226. Sir N. O'Conor wrote (June 13th), reporting that Talib Pasha Muta sarrif had resigned his appointment on 4th June, and that Eaik Pasha, General of the Brigade and Commandant in Nejd, had been appointed in his place. 227. deferring to Sir. T. Sanderson's letter of 18th April*—on the subject of the Mudirate of Wakra, the Secretary of State for India fbrwarded to the Eoreign Office, copies of the Despatch of the Government of India, No. 771 above quoted, and also Despatch No. 63^: Secret, dated 10th March 1904i, on the subject of Pearl ^Fisheries in the Persian Gulf, and observed It will be observed that the Government of India call special attention to the difficulties which may arise in connection with the rights of pearl-fishing which the tribes of El Katr possess on the coast, in the absence of any formal convention with them. As to the position of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani, Mr. Brodrick accepts the view of the Government of India that his authority is sufficiently established among the tribes to justify the conclusion of an Agreement with him, should it be thought advisable on grounds of policy. Unless therefore Sir N. O'Conor is satisfied that the action of the Turkish Govern ment in the matter of the Mudirate of Wakra has been such that His Majesty's Government, having regard to what was said in your letter of 17th November last as to the maintenance of the status quo, could not properly or consistently enter into an agreement of the kind sug gested by the Government of India, Mr. Brodrick would recommend, for Lord Lans- downe 's consideration, the proposal put forward by the Government of India, which would not only secure the exclusion of foreign interference from the peninsula, but assist the Indian authorities in maintaining control over the pearl fisheries in the Gulf. 228. Lord Lansdowne asked the opinion of Sir N. O'Conor, and sent to the India Office, his letter No. 516, dated 28th June quoted below, inviting attention especially to the last paragraph :— In the first place, I do not think it is possible to justify a Convention with Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, ot El Katr, on the ground of the delay which has occurred in the can celling of the appointment of the Mudir of Wakra. The Ottoman Government have agreed, * See paragraph 224 ante, f See paragraph 223 ante, j See Bahrein preci».although reluctantly, to annul the appointment, and Mr. Crow's despatch No. 25 oF the 16tli ultimo shows that, although action has been delated, the Wali does not deny that he has received instructions in the sense desired by His Majesty's Government, or that he will attempt ultimately to evade their execution. In my telegram No. 218 (Secret)* of the 14th November 1903, I carefully refrained from expressing the opinion, as Your Lordship's • Paragraph 220 ante. despatch under acknowledgment seems to infer, that an arrangement, sufh as the Convention with the Trucial Chiefs, did not involve any departure from the policy of maintaining the political status quo in the Persian Gulf, to which His Majesty's Government have declared their adhesion. The question seemed to be one essentially requiring careful consideration, setting its urgency and advantages against the ill-feeling which it will provoke in the minds of the Ottoman Government, and seeing how far it could b.e justified as giving His Majesty's Government the right to restrain foreign int erference in El Katr without attempting in any other way to disturb, vis-a-vis to the Turkish Government, the status quo. This i* the one argument that will be of much use in reconciling the Turkish Government to the Convention, although I should also remind them that it was' only a continuance of the agreement made in 1868 with Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Thani, referred' to in the India Office letter of the 2Uth May. In any case I would suggest, should His Majesty's Government decide in favour of ^concluding a Convention with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of the Trucial Conventions, the expediency of doing so in as quiet and secret a manner as p^sible, and basing their action upon the necessity of acquiring power to suppress piracy, ancf to maintain intact the pearl- fishing rights of the Arab tribes on the coast. I do not consider that it is Your Lordship's desire that I should express mv opinion on the merits and necessity of the policy that prompts the Government of India to advocate a Convention with the Sheikh of Katr, Ahmed-bin-Thani, as there are others far more com- potent to give a valuable opinion upon this subject. But I would venture to point out to Your Lordship that at the present moment we are threatening Turkey with an armed ex- pedition, to be manned by Bahreinese and supported by England, to avenge the murder of Sheikh Selman, committed by the Almurrah tribe in revenge for the murder of some of their people; that it has been decided to establish a British Post Office at Koweit and t) attach a Resident to the Sheikh; and that we are at the same time insisting upon the removal of the Turkish military post from Bubian Island, as also from Um Kasr, although not with quite the same pressure. I pass without comment the observations I have made to the Sublime Port# under Your Lordship's instructions in regard to the military operations in the Nejd. 229. The views of the India Office are expressed in the following Despatch of the Secretary of State (No. ^l-Secret, dated 9th September 1904) Your Excellency will observe that His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople reo-rets that a further question should be raised with the Turkish Government at the present moment when there are already other matters of importance under discussion between the Porte and' His Majesty s Government, and that he does not consider that the conclusion of the proposed agreement with Sheikh Ahmed is warranted by the delay of the Turkish Government in cancelling the Mudirate at Wakra. It appears, however, (from His Excellency's Despatch of 28th June 1904, that he considers that such an agreement might be justified to the Turkish Government on the ground that its object is to give His Majesty 's Government the rio-ht to restrain foreign interference in El Katr, without attempting in any other way to disturb the status quo so far as the Turkish Government is concerned. The decision, therefore, depends upon the question whether the objects to be attained br the proposed agreement are of sufficient^ importance to counterbalance the suspicion and ill- will which it would be calculated to arouse in the minds of the Turkish Government. The El Katr coast at present constitutes a break in the continuity of our maritime influence 'along the shores of this part of the Gulf, lying as it does between the island of Bahrein and the Pirate Coast. The absence o!; any agreement with the Sheikh may, prove, in certain contincrencies a hindrance to the proper exercise by His Majesty's ships of their duties in the suppression of piracy and the maintenance of the peace of the Gulf. It also presents a difficulty of considerable importance from the point of view of the protection of the pearl fisheries from outside interfer- rence, to which reference is made in your letter under reply. The argument which Sir N. O'Conor bases on the multiplicity of points in the Persian Gulf, regarding which he is simultaneously pressing the Ottoman Government, is of some weight, and it seems doubtful whether the considerations referred to in the second part of the preceding paragraph are of such immediate and urgent importance as to justify immediate action in spite of his reluctance to add at present to his difficulties with the Turkish Govern ment. . I shall therefore await a further expression of your views by telegraph before authority is given to you to conclude au agreement with Sheikh Ahmed, even with the precautions and reservations suggested by Sir N. O'Conor. Here the matter rests at present. 28th September 1904. ' J. A. SALDANA.S9 APPENDIX A. (Under par a graph 115.) Memorandum on the cauees of hostility between Shaikh Za'eed-bin-Khalifah, Chief of Abu- Dhabi, and Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mohatned Thani, and the raids which have been made by each o£ them on the other tribesmen or dependants. 1. In 1869 the Kubeysat, a subordinate branch of the Beni Yas of Abu- Dhabi, under Shaikh Butay-bin-Kbadim, seceded from the main tribe and set tled at the inlet of El-Odeid, a part of Abu-Dhabi, territory conterminous with the district of Katr. The seceders went to Odeid at the termination of the 1 pearl -fishing season, and were alleged to have left a number of debts unadjusted at Abu-Dhabi. 2. At Odeid the settlers renounced allegiance to, and defied the authority of, their hereditary Chief. They entered into dealings with the inhabitants and Shaikhs of El-Wakrah and El-Bidaa, on the coast of Katr, and engaged them selves in pearl-fishing, contracting fresh debts on that account. 3. Shaikh Za'eed-bin-Khalifah, the Chief of Abu-Dhabi, was greatly dis pleased with the proceedings of the Kubeysat, and wished to attack Odeid and reduce the seceders to submission to his authority : but the land route, owing to numerous creeks along the coast, was impracticable, and hostile movements by ^ sea were prohibited. Shaikh Za'eed, according to the terras of the maritime truce, submitted the case to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, representing that the settlement at Odeid was in many respects inconvenient to him, and detracted severely from the prosperily of his principal township, and afforded refuge to other parties fleeing from their territories to evade their creditors, &amp;c., and re quested permission to proceed by sea to assert his authority over his tribesmen at Odeid. Accordingly the case was referred to the Government of India for orders. 4. Meantime the Beni Hajir, Al-Murrah, and other Bedouin tribes, whose predatory acts had been for some time confined to El-Bidaa on the Katr coast, which had been unsettled by the advent of the Turks, extended their operations further south, and Odeid became a resort for piratically inclined Bedouins. The Kubeysat settlers also became implicated in irregular proceedings on the sea. 6. Several piracies and outrages were committed by the Bedouins on boats belonging to Abu-Dhabi and other places, and of these the following directly affected the relations of Za'eed-bin-Khalifah and Jasim-bin-Thani. A buggarah (pearl-fishing boat) belonging to Ghanim-bin-Ali El-Mohairebee, subject of Abu-Dhabi, having called at El-Bidaa for water and supplies, anchored for the night in the ' Dowha, ' and while the crew were asleep, a person of the , ^ Beni-Hajir tribe swam off from the shore and cut the hawser of the buggarah which went aground. A party of seven armed men then attacked the crew, killing two of them and wounding another, and plundered the boat of property valued at dollars 529. They took away also an African slave valued by the owner at dollars 120. The attack upon the boat was made close to the house of Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, and the assailants were said, by the Residency Agent on the Arab coast, to be related to that Shaikh, who was probably aware Vide Political Eesident's letter to the Government of the Outrage, if he did not actually ^ COU- of India, No. 211, dated the 16th September 1876. n i V 0 a t it. No steps Were taken by him to arrest the murderers or to compel the restoration of the stolen property. Shaikh Za'eed-bin-Khalifah complained to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and preferred a demand for 2,679 dollars as compensation for the property plundered and 11 blood ' money for the men killed and wounded. The case was reported by the Political Resident to the Government of t&gt; „ , „ , - rw™™* India who ' in addressing Her Majesty's Ftde Political Resident s letter to the Government i* . l j of India, No. 210. dated the i6th September 1876.

' x r, u i ;i l ' Ottoman Government should be moved to enforce the payment of compensation by the Shaikh of El-Bidaa for the Abu- 1% mm60 Dhabi boat plundered by his subjects. ' The reference to the Porte was not, however, productive of any result. 6. Meantime the Eesidency Agent, Arab Coast, was instructed to brin? about a friendly reconciliation between the Chief of Abu-Dhabi and his tribes men at Odeid, but he did not succeed. The Sheikhs of El-Wakrah and El- Bidaa, who were involved in pecuniary transactions with the Kubeysat did their best to frustrate any attempts at reconciliation, Sheikh Mahomed-bin- r.ve lettera ft-Qm th e Resi^ncy A g en t at shargac, Saeed Bukawarab wrote to the Residency No, 72, dated the 17th May 1877, andlOT, dated the a +1^ A 'U i. i i- 17th July 1877; also enclosure to letter from the -AQent OU tllG AldD v&gt;Oast) protesting Jui id i877 Agent ' B * h^#in, No ' 67 ' dafc * d the llth against his endeavours to mediate between uy ' the Kubeysat and their Chief. He also wrote to the Resident, stating that he had a claim of 70,000 krans against the former. Sheikh Jasim-bin-Mahomed-bin-Thani, on the other hand, became the means of obtaining a Turkish flag for the settlers at Odeid, in view to induce them to transfer their allegiance to the Porte. 7. These efforts to promote a friendlyl reconciliation between the Chief of the Beni Yas and his refactory clan having proved of no avail, and difficulties having been experienced in obtaining redress for irregularities committed at sea in the vicinity of Odeid, permission was accorded, by order of the Government of India, to Sheikh Sa'eed in 1878, to take measures to assert his Tide Political Resident's report to the Govern- rightful authority at El-Odeid. The BH- mentof India, No. 65, dated the 6th April 1878. tisll Agent Was instructed tO accompany the Chief of Abu-Dhabi to Odeid, and the Resident also proceeded to the spot in Her Majesty's ship ' Teazer ' to exfercise control over the proceedings. The Kubeysat however removed from Odeid before the arrival of the Abu-Dhabi Chief and Her Majesty's ship 'Teazer, ' and proceeded to El-Bidda, where they were welcomed by their friends, the Katr Sheikhs. The huts at Odeid were dismantled by the Kubeysat before leaving, and as the Chief of Abu-Dhabi ob jected to any renewed settlement there, he caused the water wells to be filled up, so that there might not be any further attraction for the predatory Arabs of the neighbourhood to resort there. 8. The Kubeysat resided at El-Bidaa until January 1880, when they were invited to return to their houses by their Chief Sheikh Za'eed, who sent his son Khalifah with boats to take them over. They agreed and wished to go, but found some difficulty. Sheikh Jasim, whilst not openly objecting, put obstacles in the way. Sheikh Butay-bin-Khadim with his followers however left El-Bidaa on the pretext of going to Wakrah to join some of their people there, under Shaikh Mussalim, but returned to Abu-Dhabi where they were welcomed and well treated by their Chief. 9. Shortly afterwards Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani wrote to the sons of the Chief of Abu-Dhabi, preferring a claim of krans 4,000 against Butay-bin-Khadim, Vide enclosure to shargah Agent's letter to the and requesting them to cause a settlement Besident, No. 148, dated the 3rd November 1881. of the Same. He also asked them to cause restoration of two free domestic slaves (a boy and a girl) whom the Al-Ha- wamil had carried off. 10. In May 1881, Sheikh Jasim wrote to the Political Resident, requesting Vide Political Resident's letter to the Government to be allowed to OCCUPV Odeid. wllPrp lip cf India, No. 129, dated the 29th Junt 1881. ^ m r i* t intendea to settle some of his people, and asserting that it formed part of Katr. He was informed that Odeid was ruled to be in the jurisdiction of the Abu-Dhabi Chief, and on this account, and for other reasons, no interference on his part would be tolerated. 11. In July 1881, Sheikh Jasim complained to the Political Resident, Tide Reiident's letter to the Government of India, that ButaV-bin-Khadim having* mpf nn No. 169, dated the 16th August 1881. . i , , ^Vllig mCC On 0 the pearl banks a diver by name Yacoob- bm-Abdullah, who was indebted to Ali-bin-Rashid of Wakrah, seized him and took some pearls from him. Sheikh Jasim, at the same time, brought to notice his previous money claim against Butay, and stated that it was his intention toseize him and recover Lis claim from him. Sheikh Jasim was informed that hostile movements by sea would be prohibited, and was invited to send an agent to Abu-Dhabi, where the British Agent had instructions to investigate the claim and complaint referred to. He did not do so, and the Eesidency Agent's enquiry showed that the complaint was exaggerated, and that Butay did not admit Jasim's claim, and preferred counter claims against the people of El-Katr, A reference to Sheikh Za'eed elicited refutation of the charges and a renewal of his claim for compensation for property plundered and blood money for the two men killed in the buggarah at El-Bidaa in 1876. 12. In December 1881, some of the Beni-Hajir and other Bedouin tribes * n t * a ^ la-r ^ 1Q, in the vicinity of El-Katr made a raid in Babrem Agent s letters Nos. 187 and 193, • i i u J £ -rxi i • i dated the 20th and the 28th December 1881, and Mo. tllC neignbOUrllOOCl 01 AuU Dhabi and Car - 18, dated Februnry 1S82, and Political R^ident's r | e( J awa y some Camels which theV Sold at report to tli6 OovBrnrncnt 01 Inciiaii No. 37 of Jtn 'r^i i nni-^ i • i? i? a i tat t • February 1882, also Shaikh Za'eed's letter of 22nd iil-15iaaa. ±116 Lniet 01 Abu-Dhabi prepar- February 1882, and Political Resident's report to the e( j f 0 retaliate, and Sheikh Jasim sum- Government of India, No. / 6, dated the 28th March j ii at o -m -r. • i i 1882. moned the Arabs of El-Bidaa and Wakrah to his assistance, sending at the same time Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab to Shaikh Za'eed to endeavour to make terms. Eventually an understanding was brought about between the Sheikhs. 13. In June 1885, Sheikh Jasim wrote to the Political Kesident, reiterat- Vide Political Resident's letter, to the Qovernment ing Ws old olahn and grievances against of India, No. 127, dated the 5th August 1885, and Slicikll Za'eed, and renewing Ms proposal No. 148, dat»d the soth September i88o. to occupy El-Odeid and repeople it. In reply, he was informed of the order of Government regarding that place, and requested to renounce his intention of going there. As regards his claims, he was told to send particulars in view to enquiry being made into their merits, but he did not comply. 14. In the summer of 1885, the Al-Bu Sha'ar tribe, dependents of Sheikh Vidt Bahrein Agent's news report!, dated the 29th Za eed, plundered SOmeijBedouin teams of July and eth August 1885. the dependents of Sheikh Jasim encamp ed at Na'ajah, a watering place near El-Bidaa, and carried away three female slaves. When Sheikh Jasim got this news he ordered the Beni-Hajir tribe to retaliate on Sheikh Za'eed's people, particularly on the offending tribe, the Said Al-Bu Sha'ar. Accordingly the Beni-Hajir and the Al-Murrah tribes raided the Beni-Yas territory, and carried away six camels, of which one belonged to Sheikh Za'eed himself, and the others to Shaikh Hashar-bin-Muktoom. The Bedouins conveyed the camels to El-Bidaa, and Jasim sent two of them as presents to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who in return sent him a mare. Sheikh Za'eed demanded the camels from Jasim, because the raiders had taken refuge at El-Bidaa, while the latter denied the fact, and replied that last year Mahomed- bin-Jeair of the Manasser tribe having plundered his people entered the Beni Yas territory and received protection. Strong remonstrances were exchanged between Sheikh Za'eed and Sheikh Jasim, and hostile preparations and move ments were made, but eventually Nasir-bin-Mubarik went to Abu-Dhabi at the instance of Jasim, and effected an arrangement under which Jasim was to rid* shargah Agent's report No. 32, dated the become responsible for any wrong which 22nd March 1886. might be done by his tribesmen to Sheikh Jasim's peeple. Sheikh Jasim however did not act according to the arrangement, as, when asked to do so by Sheikh Za'eed, he advanced a list of old claims against the Kubeysat tribe. Consequently hostilities continued between the Sheikhs. 15. In July 1886, Sheikh Za'eed wrote to the Political Resident, complain ing that Sheikh Jasim had been writing to the inhabitants of the Island under Abu-Dhabi, who were indebted on account of pearl-fishery claims, with the object of inducing them to repudiate their debts. At about the same time Sheikh Za'eed forwarded a letter written to him by Sheikh Jasim, transmitting a letter from the Commander of the Turkish steamer ' Zohaff,' and stating that he had orders from the Turkish authorities to rebuild El-Odeid. In forwarding these letters to the Political Resident, Sheikh Za'eed protested against Sheikh62 f—«•i •asssj^JRSK.'ws Vide Political Resident's letter to the Government ^ Uia ^,,vM'r.o+ 1 'nno onrl RViPlkh of India, No. 109, dated the 6tli August 1886. to these Communications, and bliei LL Jasim was again warned against interference with El-Odeid. , Subsequently the Turkish authorities at Busrah, on being addressed on the subject, disaYOWed and censured the action of the Commander of the Zohaff in writing to the Chief of Abu-Dhabi. 16. In August 1887, the Chief of Abu-Dhabi complained that a buggarah 1 with robbers from Wakrah put to sea, and after plundering a Bahrein boat near the Agent's No. 69, of lit September 1887. Island of Ashat, made tor a buggaran manned by some of the Kubeysat tribe who were out diving. The latter did not notice the approach of the robbers, who fired on them and pounded a man named Ashkan— so that he died. Sheikh Za eed stated that this was due to the instigation of Sheikh Jasim and Ali-bin-Hashid of W akrah. 17. In February 1888, it was reported that about 400 of the Manaseer Bedouins, known as the Al-bu-Sha'ar, mounted on 200 camels arrived at El-Na a- iah the watering place of El-Bidaa, and carried away about 40 male and female slaves. Some of the party arrived early in the morning outside the town or El-Bidaa, 1 and carried away two or three Vide news report by the Bahrein Agent, dated the j sa ^ section of the Manaseer 29th February 1888, fomarded to the Govenment of xuo oai o ^ India, with the Resident's letter No. 91, dated the tribe Were Said to be Under the autnOnty loth March 1888. of ^ Q llie f 0 f Abu-Dhabi. On hearing of this raid, Sheikh Jasim sent some men in pursuit of the Bedouins, but with out any result. This took place while the Wali of Busrahi was at El-Bidaa. 18. In April 1888, Sheikh Za'eed, while encamped at a watering -place called A1 Samaih, received informatr©^ that Sheikh Jasim was preparing to attack some of the dependencies of the Beni Yas, and while he sent messengers Vide Shargah Agent'a report No. 47. dated the to warn his people, Sheikh Jasim suddenly 16th April 1888. attacked the village of Bamnon near Lee- wah, where he arrived with his Bedouins from the direction of a waterless plain, and seized about 400 camels. He also recovered two of the female slaves who had been taken away from El-Bidda on the previous occasion. Jasim's party arrested twenty villagers, and having soundly thrashed them let them go. Sheikh Jasim is said to have sent some of the camels as presents to Bin Rasheed in Nejd, and to have received some horses in return. 19. In May 1888 Sheikh Za'eed-bin-Khalifah, sent a pa*ty of 250 Bedouins ,, .-«■ r* ^ .m, mounted on camels, led by Mahomed Vidt Bahrein Agent's report No. 57, dated the 4th , ' • -i i r. • June 1888, forwarded to the Govtrnment of India, BlU-Seif and accompanied by 111S SOH with the PoUticai Resideat'a utter No. las, dated khalifa, to raid El-Bidaa.

Extract from Captain Daly's draft letter to the address of the JPolitieal Resident m the Persian Gulf submitted for approval on 14th January 1901. Your letters of the 9th. November 1900, Nos. 269 and 270, discuss a disturb- auce 'which occurred off the Katar coast in June 1900,^ and certain piracies which were committed in the same waters in the previous year. Both these reports illustrate the desirability of obtaining a better hold on Katar, and of endeavouring to arrive at an understanding with the Sheikhs who control the peninsula. It is needless to warn you that_ it is far from^ the wish of^ the Government of India to make a show of activity in this region, which might have embarrassing results ; but there appears to be no special reason why a satisfactory modus vivendi with Sheikhs Jasim and Ahmed-Mn-Thani should not be secured. The position is perhaps somewhat complicated by the presence of a Turkish garrison at Bidaa, but you are aware that the British Government do not admit that the Porte is in effective occupation of the coast to the south of the limits of the Katiff district. In the particular cases under reference, the Government of India, as at present advised, would be prepared to accept the proposals made in your letter No. 269, provided that there was a reasonable expectation of recovering the fines and to endorse generally the views expressed in your letter No. 270. In neither instance, however, does there appear to be any reason for haste, and if some arrangement of a permanent character could be made with the Sheikhs, which would provide against similar troubles in future, it might be well to allow what is past to be forgotten.64 APPENDIX 0. [Underparagraph 200.) Memorandum by Mr. Block about Turkish claims over Katar, (Enclosure No. 842 on Secret; E., August 1903^ Nos. 313-402.) The Turks claim tbe Katar coast as part of the Nejd, to which, in 1871, they sent a military expedition to assimilate it to the other provinces of the Empire. We have never admitted the validity of this claim, and we have treated mis behaviour on the part of the local Chiefs without much regard to Turkish pretensions, though the Turks have, at the invitation or with the connivance of those Chiefs, established small military posts at Ojeir, Zobara and El Bidaa. It does not appear that any remonstrance was addressed to the Turkish Government against the establishment of the post at El Bidaa, the date of which is not mentioned, but to which Colonel Talbot alludes in his No. 76 of the 7th May 1893 as having existed, though unrecognised for 20 years or so. In 1881 British naval officers were instructed not to allow themselves for the future to be too much hampered by the three-mile limit in pursuing and - capturing pirates, especially as the Turkish authority on the coast was at many points of a very shadowy description. The Porte was informed that, as our remonstrances against unrestrained piracy in Turkish waters had produced no result, the British naval officers in the Persian Gulf would be authorised, when necessary, to take such measures as they might think fit for the protection of British commerce, without reference to the claims of the Sultan to territorial jurisdiction in those waters. In reply to a complaint respecting the action of British Consular Foreign Office No. 173, dated nth May 1883. authorities in regard to the Chief of El Bidaa, Lord Granville stated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 7 th May 1883—'I beg leave to remind Your Excellency that the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Katar coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty's Government.' In 1889 Her Majesty's Embassy represented to the then Grand Vizier Sir A. Sandison to Sir W. White, 4th July 1889. var i 0US COnS i ( ^ era tionS which made it very desirable for the Turkish Govern ment not to extend its military action south of Katif.

In any case, the Ottoman Government having been left in ignorance of this act, it can have no influence on its sovereign rights. Moreover, it is merely an armistice between Sheikhs, and could in no case be invoked against the establishment of Turkish military posts at Zobara and Odeid. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reports that there are no Turkish troops at Zobara, and that Odeid Foreign office No. 73, dated 29th March 1892. . g Reports are prevalent that the Turks intend to send troops to Katr to attack Jasim. The Resident suggests that he would be justified in preventing the Turks from occupying either Zobara or Odeid, and compelling their evacuation if suddenly seized. He has been instructed in reply by Lord Lansdowne to report any movements of the Turks on Zobara or Odeid, but to take no measures of forcible opposition with out orders. In 1803 the question of the Katar coast came to the fore, and the Porte informed Sir C. Eord that the Sultan contemplated sending troops to the Katar coast as a dependency of the Nejd. His Majesty's Government instructed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to proceed in a ship of war to enquire into the disturbance. The Turkish Government deprecated the despatch of a British ship, and stated that'the place formed an integral part of the Ottoman domi nions ; a telegram was communicated by them from the Governor and inhabit ants of Katr, acknowledging the Sultan's sovereignty. Colonel Talbot, who did proceed to El Bidaa, recommended that an effort should be made to procure the withdrawal Foreign Office No. 123, dated 23rd May 1893. 0 f the Turks from the Katar peninsula. A proposal was made to negotiate with the Sultan to resign his supposed rights over the Katar peninsula to Jasim and Ahmed, his brother, but Lord Kosebery thought that nothing would come of it. Lord Kimberley subsequently proposed that Her Majesty's Government should continue the policy laid down Foreign office No. 225, dated 29th August 893. 0 f denying Turkish jurisdiction over El Katar. Lord Rosebery assented, but did not think it necessary to make any official communication on the subject to the Turkish Government, unless they raised the question officially. Rustera Pasha was reminded unofficially of Lord Granville's Declaration of the 7th May 1883 (see above Minute on India Office, 10th August 1893, in Confidential Paper 6410). The Government of India have directed that the Commandant and Senior Naval Officer may be informed that His Foreign Office No. 94, dated 27tb March 1894. ships are no t to recognise Turkish rule at El Bidaa, but that British naval officers should avoid giving Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting by overt action such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in that locality, and owing to this His Majesty's ships should refrain from visiting the harbour of El Bidaa except when special occasion for doing so arises. The India Office drew attention to the discrepancy in the suggestion contained in the Foreign Office letter to the India Office of the 26th August 1893, of recognising the nominal suzerainty of the Porte at El Bidaa so long as the Turkish authorities do not move beyond the limits of the town. It was pointed out that this was incompatible with the instructions of the Govern ment of India that Her Majesty's ships should not recognise Turkish rule at El Bidaa. In reply, the Eoreign Office concurred in the instruction to the Naval Commander.66 A complaint having been made by the ' Nakhoda ' (master) of a British „ . boat against the Turkish Commander at El Foreign OflSce No. 191, dated 19kh Jane 1894. , d ., ^ x f t j- • x l i Bidaa, the Government of India instructed the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf to take no further action in the matter, as the result of pursuing it further would probably have been to elicit from the Commandant's superiors an assertion of the Porte's jurisdiction at £1 Bidaa.
