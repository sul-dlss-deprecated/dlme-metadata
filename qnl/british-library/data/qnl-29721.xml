We have signalled Headquarters, R.A.F., Middle East and had a reply to the effect that they have no knowledge of any instructions having been issued that surplus medical stores at Bahrein are being packed for return to the United Kingdom; that there are, in fact, no surplus stores at present; but they will get in touch with the Bahrein Government dndd any surpluses arise at a future date. We have also confirmed that no instructions on this subject have been issued by our medical people here. You are no doubt aware that the Ministry, of Supply is the department responsible for the disposal of stores overseas which are surplus to R*A.F. requirements. Such surpluses at Bahrein would be thrown up by R.A.P. MED.M.E. to the Ministry of Supply local representative at Cairo who arranges disposal.

When I saw Mr. Bslgrave last autumn I understood that two more Nursing Sisters were needed for Bahrain. We were not then able to advertise because of a ban by the Ministry of Labour and, although we have mentioned Bahrain to a number of nurses applying generally to the Overseas Nursing Association, they have preferred the Colonial Service. The advertising ban is no longer in force and we can therefore proceed more actively to look for Sisters for Bahrain, but as some time has passed I shall be grateful if you will confirm that the two Sisters are still needed. The length of the contract has been altered and I believe there are other amendments since you sent the Terms and Conditions of Service for Nursing Sisters in 1944. I shall be grateful, therefore, if you will let me have a draft of the agreement that the Sisters will be required to sign. Yours sincerely, Secretary. F.K.

I have also mentioned the matter to India House ho think it most unlikely that any official there would have told Miss Bllson that she would be able to obtain everything in Bahrein, They suggest that some confusion may have arisen over the limitation to 40 lbs. of the luggage which could accompany her by air. I do not think that there is any point in pursuing further this investigation as to who said exactly what to horn eight months ago. We will do our best to see that the next time anyone is sent out to Bahrein from lie re they do not go under the wrorVi impression. With regard to Leigh*s visas, he is really very naughty.

The need of the Bahrein Govern ment for a third British sister has not been overlooked and particulars have been sent to a considerable number of nurses. We have been unfortunate, as candidates have either withdrawn or have not proved suitable. I regret that the Nursing Committee is not yet in a position to recommend a candidate, but the post has been advertised again this week and I hope before long to be able to send forward the name of a suitable candidate. I have been waiting to send an account of the expenses'of the Overseas Nursing Association in the appointment of Miss Ellson and Miss Maguire, as I thought that the third sister would follow more quickly.

The Bahrain Government will contribute as you suggest to Federated Superannuation Scheme in case of Nurses who belong to it. The Bahrain Government will be responsible for repat riation of Sisters after the probation period. Naturally we will pay the fees to your Association for appointments. I will endeavour to obtain priority for a passage for the first Sister through the Service Authorities, I gather that this is not an easy matter.Terms of Service for British Nursing Sisters, in the Bahrain Government Hospital. 1.

Is has boon publicly announced by broadcast and Ln the Pross it has been decided that travel from this country to all dostinations overseas except for business sf urgent national importance which cannot be postponed shall be suspended. While this restriction, which is of a temporary nature and will be relaxed as soon as military considerations permit, remains in force it will be necessary for a formal declaration to be made in respect oi every civilian passenger to India that he 'is proceeding overseas on essential business of national importance and.that his journey cannot be postponed', latter part of declaration being inter preted as meaning that deferment of journey even for a snort- period probably not exceeding throe months would clear y r^o- in detriment to the war effort or in grave impairment of tne efficiency of the civil administration. Having regard to shortage of European officers of Superior Civil Services, I think that it can properly be held thah deferment of return of all officers already.sent home under leave scheme would necessarily cause such dislocation of administration as to justify required declaration being made in respect of their return journey if restrictions are etil~Is*' \ in force when period of their leave in this country expires» but I .should bd glad to luiow-whether you agree with this view* It has been arranged that Mgh Commissioner’s Office, by whom declaration will be made in respect of civilians travelling by sea, shall obtain my authority to issue of it in case of officers of All-India and Central Services returning from leave, and of persons being sent out for employment undor Government in India with whoso selection or appointment India Office .has been concerned.

The names of these nurses were referred to the Ministry of Labour on April 28th and May 3rd, respectively, but v/e are still waiting to hear whether we may proceed. In order to save further delay, I am sending forward their papers, so that you may send the details by telegram to Bahrein, as requested by the Political Agent. I will telephone when I hear from the Ministry of Labour about their release. Miss Ellson is 34 years of age, and is a State Registered Nurse, State Certified Midwife, and holds a certificate for Housekeeping. She has administrative and teaching experience and has held a post as Theatre Sister. Miss Elson has been examined by Dr. A#L.Gregg, M.D., the Medical Referee for the Overseas Nursing Association, and has been found physically fit for service in Bahrein. She is at present in charge of a Ministry of Health War Nursery, and will be required to give a month’s notice when her appointment is confirmed.

We can arrange for her to be examined in Edinburgh by Colonel Glen Liston, C.I.E., M.D., when we receive authority to proceed with her appointment. She will also be required to give one month’s notice to her present employer. Both these sisters are members of the Federated Superannuation Scheme for Nurses. /AA candidate has not yet been selected for the third vacancy, hut the Committee hope to he able to recommend a suitable nurse in due course.

Q 4 4 IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, j SOUTH KENSINGTON, ~ J , LONDON, S.W.7. 29th Peoruary, Ext. 4b6/44-&lt; Sir, I am directed Dy the Committee of the Overseas Nursing Association to thank you for your letter of the 9th February, promising the support of the Secretary of State in the recruitment of three Nursing Sisters for the Bahrein General Hospital. The Committee will appreciate your help in obtaining further informa tion about some points in the terms of service. The Overseas Nursing Association has no details of the cost of living in Bahrein, and this is necessary so that we may be able to tell candidates the approximate cost of messing and other expenses that they will have to pay out of their salaries. As R.A.F. Sisters are employed in the same Hospital, the Committee would like to be assured that the net salary of the civil Sisters will compare favourably. It seems that the cost of living in Bahrein is high, as some posts have recently been advertised for Sisters in an Oil Company’s Hospital on the Island, where higher salaries and war allowances were quoted than those offered by the Bahrein Government. In our letter of 20th December, it was suggested that the Bahrein Government should contribute to the Federated Superannuation Scheme for Nurses, so that Nursing Sisters who are members of this scheme should keep their policies intact while employed overseas. The premium of the F.S.S.N. is 15$ of salary and emoluments, 1C$ from the employer, 5$ from tne Nurse. A circular giving notes on the scheme is enclosed. H T In the terms of service of the Bahrein Government, details of allowances have not been given in Section ?. Sisters generally require the outfit allowance to buy uniform and other tropical ^ i outfit before they sail. We shall be glad to know whether the Overseas Nursing Association is authorised to advance the sum.(JlPt) - 2 - In the amended terms sent Dy the Matron, it is stated that return passages are paid after completing the contract, hut it is not stated whether this includes the repatriation of the Sister if her employ ment is terminated after the probationary period. Ve shall be glad to Know whether the Bahrein Government will be sending the Overseas Nursing Association the form of agreement to be signed by the Sisters r whether the contract will be arranged by the India Office. I have written to the Matron of the Bahrein General Hospital, but as it is understood that Sisters are urgently needed, we would appreciate your help in elucidating these points. In the meanwhile, we will send the terms of service to possible candidates. I am. Sir, Your obedient servant, Secretary nA PENSIONS 40. July, 1940. The Federated Superannuation Scheme for Nurses and Hospital Officers (Contributory). (Incorporated under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1917). Temporary War-time Address :—“ Green acre,” Sutton Lane, Banstead, Surrey. NOTES ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE SCHEME. The Scheme was brought into operation on the ls^ January, 1928, and at the date of this issue has been adopted by In-patient Institutions representing 85% of the total voluntary bed complement of Great Britain, and also by over 850 Nursing Associations and many other Nursing, Charitable and other “ Institutions ” without in-patient Beds, including British managed Institutions abroad. The following notes are prepared for the convenience of Members and Participating Institutions, to give them in short and simple language certain provisions of the Scheme, “ Pensions 31.”f It should, however, be clearly understood that any questions affecting the legal interpretation of the Scheme are solely governed by “ Pensions 31.” 1. GENERAL. The Scheme is a contributory one providing Superannuation and other benefits commensurate with the career of each individual Member. Its provisions ensure free migration within *Nursing and ♦Hospital Service at home or abroad without loss of benefit, and cover every possible circumstance which may arise during each Member’s career. The Scheme is under the Administration, Management and Control of the Central Council operating through an elected Executive. In the case of a Member employed by a Participating Institution, contributions are payable as to two-thirds by the Institution and as to one-third by the Member. These contributions are applied as premiums on an Insurance Policy effected in the name of the Central Council, as Grantee and Trustee for the Member and the Participating Institution. Increment Policies, securing additional benefits, are effected at successive stages in the Member’s career. Provision may also be made for “ back service ” (i.e., service prior to the adoption of the Scheme by the Institution). The quotations furnished by the panel of Life Offices have been approved and accepted by the Central Council for the purpose of the Scheme, and the Member may select the Life Office with which the policy is to be effected. Uniformity of policy conditions has been secured. No commission is payable to anyone, and the whole of the contributions are used to obtain the maximum benefit for each Member. The rate of contributions (see Page 2) depends only on the rank and/or salary, and is not affected by the age of the Member. The benefits payable on retirement depend on the age at entry, the period of contributory service, the rank and salary attained, the amount of contributions paid, and the class of policy and Life Office selected. 2. MEMBERSHIP. \(See Clauses 17-26). (i) Subject to certain options and exemptions, the more important of which are summarised in paragraph (ii) below, membership of the Scheme is COMPULSORY in the following circumstances in the case of the following persons who are engaged by a Participating Institution after its adoption of the Scheme and forms one of the terms of their employment. (a) Every male and female Officer, as defined in the Scheme : if he/she is or as soon as he/she becomes a Senior Officer as defined in the Scheme, i.e., one whose *remuneration is ^160 per annum or more and who is engaged on the Administrative, Clerical, Dispensing, Massage or other salaried staff (except Medical, Nursing or Domestic Staff or Manual Workers). (b) Every female Trained Nurse, as dehned in the Scheme : forthwith after the date of engagement. (c) Every Probationer, as defined in the Scheme : if and wffien membership is compulsory under the regulations of the Participating Institution. (Every Participating Institution on its adoption of the Scheme makes a regulation as to whether probationers are to be admitted to the Scheme and, if so, whether they are to be admitted at the commencement of the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year of training, or whether admission is to be deferred until the completion of training). (ii) Membership is OPTIONAL in the case of the following persons (a) All eligible male and female employees as defined in the Scheme, on the Staff of a Participating Institution when it adopts the Scheme (Membership is compulsory if and when a Junior Officer on the Staff at the time of the adoption of the Scheme later becomes a Senior Officer ; see (c) below). (b) Any Probationer, after the completion of her first year of training and until membership becomes compulsory. (c) Any male or female Junior Officer (i.e., an Officer in receipt of *remuneration of not less than £100 per annum but less than £160 per annum) on the staff of a Participating Institution when it adopts the Scheme or who joins its staff after its adoption of the Scheme, until he/she becomes a Senior Officer (see (a) above), when membership becomes compulsory. *See Paragraph 11 herein. fNOTE.—All clauses quoted are those in the Scheme,” Pensions 31,” obtainable from the printers to the Scheme, Messrs. W. &amp; J. Rounce, Ltd., 18-20, Appold Street, E.C. 2, price 1/4. 8M. R. 74/740. 19 - {d) Any Male Trained Nurse as defined in the Scheme. [e) Any Male or Female Assistant Nurse, including a Midwife or Village Nurse, who is employed by a Participating Institution. (/) Any District Nurse who is a Queen’s Nurse and a member of the Long Service bund of the Queen’s Institute of District Nursing if, on account of her age when she would, but for this proviso, be bound to become a Member, she would benefit more by remaining in that Fund than by becoming a Member. (g) Any eligible male or female person employed by a Participating Institution who is a foreign subject, or who, although a British subject, is ordinarily resident outside J|P the British Isles. (A) Any eligible male or female person who is superannuable under the provisions of any statute (e.g., a midwife engaged under the Midwives Act, 1936, to whom the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1937, is applicable). (j) Any Senior Officer or Trained Nurse who is employed by two or more Institutions. (iii) A temporary employee of an Institution may NOT become a member. Employment for any period not exceeding six months may be regarded as temporary employment if the Participating Institution and the employee so agree. (iv) The maximum ages for New Entrants are :— Men 59 next birthday ; Women 54 next birthday ; but any New Entrant who has reached either of the above respective ages at the commencement of membership and is in the employment of a Participating Institution when it adopts the Scheme may become a Member with the permission of the Participating Institution and the Council. 3. CONTRIBUTIONS. (i) All contributions in respect of employees of Participating Institutions are payable as to two-thirds by the Participating Institution and as to one-third by the Member and are continued throughout the period of employment, irrespective of age attained. (ii) Rates of Contributions. (a) District Nurses, Candidates in Training, District Midwives and Village Nurses (including both Trained Nurses and Assistant Nurses). {See Clauses 93 to 95) : The Institution may select any one of the under-mentioned rates of contributions. The higher the rate of contributions selected the greater will be the benefits secured to the Member :— A minimum premium of £18 p.a. An alternative premium of £21 p.a. An alternative premium of £24 p.a. An alternative premium, if *remuneration is £180 p.a. or more, viz. : 15% of the remuneration (provided as to two-thirds (10%) by the Institution and one-third (5%) by the Member). (b) All Other Eligible Employees. {See Clause 3) : The total contribution is 15% of the *remuneration, payable as to two-thirds by Institution and one-third by the Member. (iii) Increased Contributions. {See Clauses 33 and 95). From time to time contributions are increased and additional policies are effected at successive stages in the individual Member s career, thus securing additional benefits commensurate with the rank and salary attained. (iv) Back Service Contributions. {See Clauses 43 to 47). If desired, special arrangements can be made to secure additional benefits in respect of the back service of Members who have already given some years of service prior to their inclusion in the Scheme. Full information may be obtained on application to the Central Office of the Scheme. 4. MIGRATION. {See Clauses §2 to 89 and 102). One of the most important features of the Scheme is that membership is continued until retirement trom Nursing/*Hospital Service. The provisions of the Scheme cover not onlv migration to another Participating Institution (in which case contributions by and in respect of the Member continue, either compulsorily or optionally) but also periods during which the Member may be unable to provide contributions, or may be able to contribute only at a reduced rate, e.g., on migration within Nursing or Hospital Service at home or abroad but otherwise than to a Participating Institution. ,, ,,. In each case of migration otherwise than to a Participating Institution, the Central Office of the Scheme advises the Migrant of the several options available, which may be summarised briefly as under : (i) To contribute as a Private Member an amount equal to the full premium on the policy. (ii) To contribute as a Private Member a minimum amount equal to one-third of the policy (i.e., ordinarily the amount previously deducted from salary). premium on the current (iii) To suspend temporarily the payment of premiums for some stated period. (iv) To cease payment of premiums. Whichever course is adopted, the interests of the Member and of any Participating Institution concerned are fuUy protected and full account is taken of all contributions previously paid. In the case of a Defend AnnuSv ^Hospita^Service.h 6 ^ ^ ~ “ comp^XS *See Paragraph 11.5. *PENSION AGE. (See Clauses 105 and 129 to 134). The Scheme does not provide for a specific age for retirement. This remains a matter of arrangement between the Institution and the Member, but for the sake of uniformity policies are written to mature as follows :— (i) Men—on the anniversary date of the policy in the 60th year of age. (ii) Women—on the anniversary date of the policy in the 55th year of age. *“ Pension Age ” is the date on which the initial policy matures. If a Member continues in *Hospital/*Nursing Service after any policy has matured, whether before, at, or after Pension Age, contributions are also continued and the benefits secured on retirement are correspondingly increased. 6. FORM OF BENEFIT. The Scheme provides a choice of two forms of benefit :— (i) The Deferred Annuity policy. This is most suitable for single women without dependants since it secures at maturity an annuity or a single cash payment of guaranteed amounts, and provides for the return of all premiums with compound interest in the event of termination of membership or death before the policy maturity date. (ii) An Endowment Assurance. This is more usually selected by a Male Officer or other Member who considers it necessary to make provision for a dependant who might otherwise suffer serious hardship in the event of the premature death of the Member. An Endowment Assurance secures a single cash payment on death before maturity or an annuity at guaranteed rates in lieu of the cash payment at maturity. Unlike the Deferred Annuity Policy the surrender value of an Endowment Assurance in its early years is less than the premiums paid because of the insurance cover given against the risk of death. Any one of three forms of Endowment Assurance may be selected :— (a) “ Without-profits ”—the Sum Assured remains unchanged throughout the duration of the policy. (b) “ With-profits '—the Sum Assured is increased by the addition of bonuses declared out of the profits of the Life Office. (c) “ With guaranteed bonus ” of £2 per cent, per annum—the Sum Assured increases at a uniform rate each year. Endowment Assurances issued since the outbreak of War on the 3rd September, 1939, are subject to a condition (not applicable to policies issued before the outbreak of War) providing that :— *' If the death of the Life Assured (the Member) shall arise either directly or indirectly from any war ' (whether war be declared or not) the amount payable under this policy shall be limited to a sum being either :— (i) ' the total amount of premiums (exclusive of extra premiums) paid hereunder less any sums ' paid by the Company in respect of bonuses in cash, portions of sum assured or of surrender “ value, or otherwise ; or (ii) “ the surrender value of the policy ; “ whichever shall be the greater, but shall not exceed in any case the sum assured stated herein and attaching “ bonuses, if any.” 7. RETIREMENT. RETIREMENT BEFORE *PENSION AGE AND WITHIN THE ^PRESCRIBED PERIOD. (See Clauses 114-122). In the event of retirement within a prescribed period (the periods are five to ten years from the date of admission to membership according to the class of Member), the Member's policies are at his/her option either surrendered or assigned to him/her. If the policies are surrendered the *Benefit of the member’s contributions are fpaid to him and the *Benefit of the Institution’s contributions are fpaid to the Participating Institutions concerned. If the member’s policies are assigned to him the member jpays to each Participating Institution concerned an amount equal to the Benefit of its contributions or if unable to make this payment the policies are adjusted before assignment so that in either case the Participating Institution jreceives the Benefit of its contributions. In all cases of assignment, stamp duty is payable by the Member. RETIREMENT BEFORE *PENSION AGE BUT AFTER THE ^PRESCRIBED PERIOD. (See Clauses 123-125). In the event of retirement after the prescribed period one of the following courses are adoptedf :— (i) The policies are assigned to the Member. (ii) The policies are assigned upon trust for the application of the policy moneys and the income thereof in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. (iii) The policies are surrendered and the proceeds are paid to the Member for his absolute use and benefit. (iv) The policies are surrendered and the proceeds are applied in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. (v) The policies are surrendered and the proceeds are applied in the purchase of an annuity for the Member and his dependants. RETIREMENT AT *PENSION AGE. (See Clauses 126-128). In the event of retirement at Pension Age one of the following courses are adopted :— (i) The annuity secured by any matured policy is applied in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. (ii) The policy moneys of any matured policies are paid to the Member for his absolute use and benefit, or are applied in the purchase of an annuity for the Member and his dependants or are paid or applied in or towards the maintenance of the Member and his dependants. *See Paragraph 11. fin each case subject to a deduction or charge in respect of the expenses of terminating membership. 34 RETIREMENT AFTER PENSION AGE. (See Clause 135). In the event of a Member continuing in service after Pension Age contributions also are continued until retirement, when correspondingly increased benefits are paid or applied as in cases of retirement at Pension Age. 8. DEATH. (See Clauses 136 and 137). (i) Members other than probationers ; The policy moneys (i.e., the surrendei value of Deferred Annuity policy, or the Sum Assured, with bonuses if any, under an Endowment Assurance) are paid to the personal representatives of the deceased Member or are applied in and towards the maintenance of the deceased Member’s dependants. (ii) Probationers : On the death of a probationer the Benefit of the member’s contributions are paid to the personal representatives of the deceased Member and the Benefit of the Institutions contributions are payable to the Institutions concerned. (iii) On the payment of any moneys in respect of a deceased Member whether to the personal representatives of the deceased Member or to the deceased Member s dependants, a deduction is made in respect of expenses. 9. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. The Administrative Expenses of the Scheme are met principally by Annual Subscriptions payable by Participating Institutions and by Entrance Fees payable by individual Members. 10. INCOME TAX. This Scheme is regarded by the Board of Inland Revenue as one to which the proviso to Section 32 (3) (e) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, applies. The contributions made under it by Members, and Private Members consequently rank as life assurance premiums for relief of income tax. 11. DEFINITIONS.

I will inform my Committee at their meeting this week that the Secretary of State for India supports the request of the Bahrein Government and we will endeavour to find suitable Sisters. As requested, I am sending a copy of the letter addressed to the Ministry of Labour, asking for permission to advertise these vacancies. A reply has now been received, giving the Over seas Nursing Association permission to advertise, with the stipula tion that State Registered Nurses with the First Certificate of the Central Midwives Board should be considered. Owing to the acute shortage of midwives in this country, the Ministry is unwilling to release State Certified Midwives unless they will be employed specially in midwifery overseas. Nursing Sisters with the First Certificate are eligible for service in the Colonial Government Hospitals, where the duties are presumably similar to those of the Sisters in the Bahrein Government Hospital. As the Bisters are required in Bahrein as soon as possible, we are advertising the vacancies. There are some points, however, on which the Committee may need further information, and they will appreciate your offer to refer these to Bahrein. A further letter will be sent in a few days.

Harbottle, saying that she Te have received a letter from Miss IT, Matron of the 'Bahrain Government hospital, has been authorised by Mr. Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the ahran Government, to make tentative enquiries regarding the possibixity of recruiting three fully trained British Arsing Sisters for the service. Miss Harbottle was formerly annointed 0 v ?r^ eas Arsing Association for service in Iraq and Malaya, although she obtained her present position independently. The Overseas Nursing Association has not hitherto recruited nursing staff for Bahrain. Miss ^ T arbnttle writes ' ,TT e do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission and permits, as 26 beds are used for the European Services, and also the Indian Army and Arab Levies are nursed by us. The R.A.F. have lent us four Sisters until such time as we can recruit civil ones ux our own. I enclose brief particulars of the suggested agreement tor British Nursing Sisters, who should be S.R.N. anu and preferably under 33 years of age and trained n c* voluntary hospital. This is a General Hospital of 150 eus, with a British State Medical Officer in charge. There is axso a British lady Medical Officer and myself. The hospital has a good nursing staff of Indian trained nurses anu local dressers and probationers. It is our intention I ^ a ^ an fcnd gradually train up the Arab staix with the help of the Nursing Sisters’ t . ... Nurses have recently been included in the Control of engagement order of the Ministry of Labour, and the Overseas Nursing Association can only advertise through the Overseas Manpower Committee of the Ministry. My Committee wish me to whether the xndia Office support the request of the Bahrain Government and would be prepared to represent to the Ministry o 'our that the need of Sisters in Bahrain is sufficient to /justify ask-2- 20/12 A 3 justify their release at the present time. I enclose a copy of the terms of service sent by the Matron. The Overseas Nursing Association has no information about the cost of living in Bahrain. 'Hie Committee would suggest that the Government be asked to contribute to the Federated Superannuation Scheme for Nurses in place of the Provident Fund, as most Sisters would already be insured in the Federated Superannuation Scheme and it is desirable that their policies should be kept intact while serving out of the United Kingdom. It is difficult to say what prospect there would be during the war of finding suitable candidates for these posts, but if the Overseas Nursing Association were assured of the approval and support of the India Office, the Committee would endeavour to | meet the wishes of the Bahrain Government on receiving definite | instructions. The appointment fee usually charged by the Overseas Nursing Association to cover office and other expenses of recruit ment is six guineas. I am.

I find that in October 1938 Belgrave engaged the services of a lady doctor, Miss M.M.McDowall, for the Bahrain State Hospital on a s^fary of Rs .800/- per mensem rising by annual increments of Rs.25/- per mensem. A year later in December 1939 he engaged a nurse, a Miss N.M. Harbottle, as Matron of the same hospital. Both contracts contain a clause making the Political Agent in Bahrain the final arbitrator in any dispute but in neither case did Belgrave refer the matter to the Political Agent before concluding the agreements. Since the contracts were signed two years ago and as I have had no reason tb be dissatisfied with the manner in which Dr.McDowall and Miss Harbottle perform their duties it would seem unjust to withhold sanction at this stage. I have however instructed Alban to ensure that the Bahrain Govt, do not again engage the services of Europeans without previous reference to me. Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.G.Prior.

As the matter is somewhat urgent I am venturing to write to you direct in order to avoid the delays involved in the post to and from Bushire. 3. The Bahrain Government would be most grateful indeed if the India Office Medical Board would interview and report on the five applicants whose papers are sent herewith. I should explain that Belgrave and I went through all the applications received and eliminated those who did not sound too promising, the five remaining being those who seem to be the most likely people for the post. Their names and addresses are:- 1. Dr. Ian Davenport Jones, The Middlesex Hospital, W.l 2. Dr. F.B. Turner, Royal Automobile Club, S.W. 1. 3. Dr. K.F.D.

There are two or three other applicants who sound pos sible, but as they are abroad in India or Africa and as it seems essential that likely applicants should be interviewed they are not included in this list. 4/-m* 1 * '■up - 2 - 4 # I enclose a copy of the advertisement which was in serted in the 'Lancet” and the 'British Medical Journal' and also a note prepared by Belgrave giving some idea of the duties which the State Medical Officer will he required to perfom. I might perhaps add to this note that although the new out-patients* dispensary is already under construc tion, plans for the main hospital and wards have not yet been approved, and the new doctor will in all probability have an opportunity of giving his views in regard to the type and size of the buildings to be constructed. 5. Belgrave is going on leave in June this year and it is desirable that, if possible, the new doctor should arrive in Bahrain before Belgrave goes. Hence the urgency in this case. 6. I hope it will be possible for the Medical Board* s report^ to include a recommendation in regard to the most suitable applicant. 7.
