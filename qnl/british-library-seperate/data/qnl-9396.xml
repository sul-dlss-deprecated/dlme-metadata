The papers mostly concern the erroneous dumping of ammunition into the sea too near to the shore, from where it could be recovered by local inhabitants, and subsequent questions about the quantity of ammunition disposed of, and to what extent it was likely to be serviceable.The correspondence is mostly between the following: the India Office; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Headquarters, British Forces, Aden; and the Political Agent, Muscat.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Headquarters, British Forces, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras al Hadd</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Ammunition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001f3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
