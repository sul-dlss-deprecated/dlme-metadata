During ay yieit te Buehire last month I explained rerhally t# Ctlenel Cresthwaite the general eituatien recardinj: the prtgress ef the work of the Eastern and Genera^yndicate in boring for water in Bahrein. On March 28th, 1925 in Well No« 1 in Manamah,water was encountered at a depth of 198 feet bearing the horizon from which the principal springs on the islands are derired* The head to which the water reached was about 10 feet abore the ground, ani by puaping at the rate of 2500 gallons per hour it was only possible to lower the lerel inches below the ground. The water is similar in quality to the fine Adhari spring about 3 miles from Manaraah, but not entirely sweet. As there already exists in other parts of the islands (particularly in the Haneni wells) a superior quality of water to that which had been encountered in Veil No* 1, the Syndicate were requested by Sheikh Hamad to continu boring in Well No. 1, if necessary as far as the contracted depth of §00 feet, and to endearour toV tap a source of sweeter water. The work was accerdinfly centinued until ehartly befere l£ajtr Daly* b departure when it was stepped Toy a 'breakage in the berinf: ------ apparatus* It was net until early in AUfust that a new part arrirei frem England and alnest simultaneeusly with it instructiens te the Enfineere frem their lenden Office te mere the 'berinj: plant te the site of Well 1T0»2 in Moharraq and to commence operations there, as Well Ko» 1 H Would not be sunk deeper at the moment* 1 . Sheikh Hamad wired to the Eastern and General Syndicate in London requesting that the deepening of Well Ko. 1 should not 'be delayed, as he had great- expectations of fresh water 'being discorered at a greater depth than that already reached. A reply was receired to the effect that Major Holmes was coming out in September and would explain e-rerything. In the meanwhile the Engineers had commenced moYing their plant to l/oharraq. Owing to the intense heat in August howerer, they found it impossible to carry on the work f and it was not until about 10 days ago that operations in Moharraq were commenced* I do not feel at all satisfied with the arrangements of the Eastern and General Syndicate for carrying out this work. The boring plant should hare been properly supplied with spare parts and a repair outfit in the first place, an# but for extreme aallous- ness on the part of the London Office, the spare parts ordered would hare arrired in Bahrein much earlier. As the rotary tackle was used in the boring •f Well Ko, 1, samples of the borings are in the hands il of Engineers. A As Major Holmes is expected here in a few days I will discuss with him the question of handing these oyer to the Bahrein GoTernment. - ' to n v • Political Agent, Bahrein.confidential . D ,0 .

I have w ust had a lone talk with liajor Holmes on the subject of water and oil in Baiirain. He arrived here on the 8th instant, and called on me at once. Owing to a pressure of work at the end of the diving season, I had no opportunity of discussing these questions thoroughly until today. as you know, the geological conditions in Bahrain are such that these two matters, water and oil, c.:re somewhat inter mixed. The 'spring' area is however apparently limited to that portion of the main island north of a line drawn due East and «.'est through Rafaa -t».sh bharqi, and includes the xiiiK islands of Sitrah and kuharraq. according to Major Holmes, it is only close to the above line or anywhere south ot it that oil drilling operations could be safely carried out, without interfering with the spring water supply. He bases this supposition on the theory that the spring water comes originally from the Persian side of the Gulf, flowing betv.'een two layers of impervious rock, which emerges at the surface along a clearly defined belt roughly paraltil witii the coast, similar springs to those in Bahrain being found in (^atif on the main land. Thus any wexls drilled to the south or main land side of this belt should not interfere with the flow of thewater. In regard to the tv/o experimental artesian wells which the eastern and General Syndicate are now in the course of drilling, I explained in my letter No.85/9^9 dated the 4th October 1925 that after reaching water in the Lanamah well, the Syndicate had transferred their plant to Muharraq. Here Lieut. Colonel F.B.Prideaux, G.S.I., C.I.L., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.II. % after drilling for a few days only, they have already reached a depth of about thirty feet, the water encountered li the lianamah we~1 is ai)parently the same as that irom which the principal springs on the island are derived, ana as the well is located slightly to the North of txaxt the line of springs, support would appear to be given to the aiove- mentioned theory that the source of the water must be looked for on the Persian side of the Gulf. In regard to the quality of the water found, and the |ix prospect of finding fresher water at a greater depth, idajor Holmes had much to say. He was convinced in the first place that the salt found in the water when it was first struck has now been reduced more than 50^ (and with this, alter tasting the water today, I agree), and he considers in the second place that there is danger of polluting the whole water supply of Bahrain by drilling deeper through the lower layer of impervious rock, where there might just as likely be salt as fresh water. He is however quite willing to do ao as 1ar as the contracted depth of 600 leet, but only on written instructions from the Sheikh in reply to a Letter from nim indicating clearly the risxs involved. I have asked him to address such a letter to the ^heikh, but 1 would nol consider it advisable to instruct him to bore deeper, until the water at present flowing from the well has Deen pppperlv tested, and further ( inn order to reduce the risk to a minimum) until a well has been drilled outside the spring area, and indicat- -ions have been found of the probable geological conditions » below the lower layer of rock. This would be possible if the Syndicate were to obtain an oil concession in Bahrain. Major Holmes argues however that there never was any real prospect of striking any other than the local spring water, Mr. Madgewick is, he says, the best geological expert that the Syndicate have, and his considered opinion is that the Kaneni wells are purely rain seepages. I was rather amused by a remark kajor Holmes made J1-h in. 3 while on the subject of the relative possibilities of water and oil in Bahrain. He said, 'the wealth of Eaiirain lies in the water'! This seemed an extraordinary remark from a man who has come to negotiate an oil concession, which is a far more viluab^e proposition for his Syndicate than any amount of Artesian v/ell drilling'. He was alluding of course to the va^ue of this water for irrigation purposes, if properly controlled and distributed over the island. Major Holmes is sure that time will show that the wlu. water encountered in the Kan amah v/ell eventually satisfy the \ highest aspirations of the people of Bahrain for a good and plentiful supply of drinking water, but he is ready within a reasonable time to drill deeper, if Sheikh Ha-ad is ready to take the risk. This seems to me to be a fair deal. i?or the sake of convenience, I will deal With the question of oil in a separate letter.

Hajt Yuief bin Abdul Rahman Kazoo, seeing that this not be paid without the co-operation of others coi fer- rtd with the authorities and pointed out that all fiobles should be called on to lick into this case. On December 7, the Bahrein Government sent invitations to all notables and on December 8 a meeting was held.

[ ^ X &gt;^ - ru^iurfcA 2 J 1l it A ' PROGRESSIVE SHEIKH. BAHREIN GOING AHEAD. Ensuring Fresh-Witer Supply, was (Fkom Our Own Corriipondikt.) Baghdad, Tuesday. A visitor to Baghdad, who recently in Bahrein, has much to say in commendation of Sheikh Hamad ibn Isa al-Kalifa, the go-head ruler of the islands. Sheikh Hamad recently returned from a visit to England, where he was received by His Majesty King George. While he was in England he was given many opportunities of seeing different factories at work turninaj out the many kinds of articles which help to make up the sum-total of British-made goods. He also frequently visited the Empire Exhibition. Sheikh Hamad came back full of zeal and eagnerness to apply some of the ■ icfoas garnered abroad for the benefit of his people, and to relieve eoms of tho j more pressing needs of Bahrein. Fresh-Water Supply. The first move was to secure the very best technical advice as to the possibility of securing an adquate fresh-water supply for the two principal towns, Manamah and Moharraq. These towns are situated on two different inlands. The water supply in the past, for the town of Moharraq, which has a popula tion of approximately 25,000, had been obtained from fre^h-water springs issuing in the sea. The wafer from this source was alwayn brackish, but not nearly §0 brackish a-? would be supposed considering the source whence it came. The report of the technical experts recommended that boring bo undertaken with a view to inttrcepfeing the spring waters before they emerged into the sea. This advice was acted on, and two ex perimental wells were tontracted for, one on Manama Island and the other on Moharraq Island. Intertsling Results. The two wells were completed in the latter months of la^t year, and they gave most interesting results. In the Manaman well fresh water of good quality was struck in the seven- inch borehole at the depth of a little less than 250 feat below the surface. The flow of water is approximately 6,000 gallons an hour, and it rises 11 feet above the surface of the ground. In the Moharraq well fresh water was struck at a depth ol 21S feet below the surface. The w iter from this well is of excelloRt quality, being beautifully clear and pure. This is the first drinking water that has ever been found on Moharraq. The well is sunk in the centre of the town. The water rises 14 feet about the surface and the well, which is lined with five- inch piping to within a few feet of the water-bearing zone, yields about 4 ,000 gallons of water per hour. Anxious To Taste It, AVheu the water was firbt struck in Moharraq it seemed to become known to the inhabitants of the town like magic. In less than an hour the well and all roads leading to it became crowded with people anxious to taste the water. Sheikh Hamad has now decided to put down from 10 to 20 additional wells in the liope that the drinking-water supply of the towns will be made secure for all time. The cost of water in the past to the inhabitants of Bahrein and Moharraq town exceeded Rs. 200,000 per annum. When the full scheme of well-boring is completed the people will receive their water without payment of any kind. Truly this is a magnificent gift for any ruler to make to his people, and it. is not to be wondered at that Sheikh Hamad is loved, and almost worshipped, by hia people. And Roads Too. In addition to the water-supply road-making machinery has been imported, and there are now more than 40 miles of good roads in use in Bahrein. A few years ago roads did not exist. It is a sign of the times that there are now more than 100 motor-cars and lorries on the islands, whereas 18 months ago there was none. Sheikh Hamad is fortunate in his political advisers, as both Colonel Prideaux, tho Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Major C. K. Daly, the Political Agent in Bahrein, have assisted and encouraged Sheikh Hamad in every way to inaugurate works of public utility.TCo y /y/s The Agency, Bahrain 18/1^/26. BUSH!RE RESIDENCY.

This area is occupied in the suimer by p.opi. ixxiodaxr from Muharraq who live in reed huts,it will probably however be shortly permanently built upon. It is anticipated that the annual exodus from lluharraq. to reea huts along the shore of Vanameh Island^will .largely cease on the introduction of a water supply for Kuharraq,as it was principally lack of water in Kuharraq in the hot months^that caused this exodus. ■iisiices.

Sir, I have the honour to report lor the information of the Ron'ble the Political Recident that on the iight of Wednesday 13th October at about 8 p.m. while ITShaikh Kamad wac driving in his Hudson car to visit his wife at Bada four shots were fired at him. This outrage occurred in the neighbourhood of Sanabis at a place where a small bridge spans an irrigation channel crossing the road. Shaikh Hamad informs me that the first shot was fired at thi moment when the car had reached the bridge. One bullet threw up the dust in front of the car and the front mud guard was hit by the ricocnet. Abdulla bin Jahar immediately accelerated and shot off the bridge at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Three other shots were fired, two of which apparently went between the Hudson and the car containing servants which was following immediately behind. The fourth shot apparently went wide. Shaikh Hamad himself was carrying a sword and a dagger but the rest of his party were unarmed except for the customary dagger. Shaikh Hamad informs me that there is no doubt that his life was intended and that it was not a case of robbers holding up any passing motor car, as his Hudson is well known, it was carrying brilliant lights and the Shaikh*s flag on the bonnet waswas easily discernible. The site for the ambush was very skilfully selected. The would be assasBins had taken up a position in a garden belonging to shaikh Jahomod bin Esa al Khalifah, and had made in the brushwood wall surrounding the garden rests and loop holes for their rifles in such a manner that a car crossing the bridge was brought within six yards of them. I have myself visited the scene of the outrage and can only ascribe Shaikh Hamad* 0 escape either to the extreme mervousness of the firer or the dazzling effect of the Hudson 1 s head lights. Escape for the aggressors was simple as the brushwood wall gave cover from view and the 9^ thick fol/iage of the garden rendered it easy for the criminals to B^nk away. A search made next morning revealed the loopholes, and rifle rests to which 1 have already referred, C empty cartridge/ cases Mark VI, and a half smoked cigarette, which is now in M^.Belgrave*s po ssession. With the assistance of Lt.Robinson and a party of men under his orderfcjthe villages 01 Sanabis and Jidd Hars as well as certain suspected quarters of Manama were searched but nothing of an incri minating nature has been found. Rumours of the wildest nature incriminating most people from Bin Saud downwards are,of course^ in circulation, but there is,as yet, no reason to suspect any particular person or persons of committing the outrage. Shaikh Hamad himself is inclined to suspect that it is the work of Baluchis, actuated by feelings of revenge for the recent execution of Ismail Shah Murad. This, however, is merely surmise oni his partjand I myself see no reason why a Baluchi vendetta should be the cause of the outrage any more than the jealousy of certain members cf the Al Khalifahjfamily. A reward of Rs.6000/- for information leading to the arrest of the criminals has been offered, and it is hoped that sooner or later trustworthy information may be obtained. I have the honour to be.

The administration of ^Taqfs' is, as it has s I t/ays kasz beer, in the hands of the Qatihis or und -r :Jie supervision of those persons in whose favour the TTT a jf has been made. The Bahrein Government remark that under other rusulman Governments ^aqfs are manage* by a special department of the Government.

You did me the honour of visitinr me this morning !inr 1 T could understand from the conversation of 3hail:h Kuesain bin Ali si 'annaei that he isj of opinion thet people administering the states of minors should be permitted to eat uv the property of th^ minors if such be their wish without interference from the Government. I explained that minora are not in a position to brin/* an action in the Courts against their guardians until they have ^rown to years of discretion and by that time a dishonest p;uardien would have disposed of all the property so that the minor even though the court gave judment in his favour would gain nothing. It seems to me that it is the duty of a Government to look to the interests of all its subjects, especially those who are unable to IvcY after themselves, and I am sure that you all who are people of learning and education will agree with me in this. I sarr also from your questions and answers tMa morning a strange thing and that is that you considered it to be the business of the Political Agent to give orders to Shaikh Hamad in the administration of the internal5/ affairs of Pahreir. It is true that the British Government protect their friends Shaikh Kamad and all his people and wish them well, but the special ■iut.y or the Political Afcent is to lock after the Interests of Eritich subjects and others over whom he has been granted juried Action.

Sheikk Abdulla of t^atar has written aLXx^LaucxfcrxxaiiLtijBjt^jct- and also informed me tkat ke was very anxious to Bieet Sheikh M^aad owing to tkeir friendship of long stand ing. This would be, I think, a very popular move and would tend perhaps to draw ^atar nearer to Bahrein with corresponding advantages to that country and this in closer trade con nections and a greater influx of new ideas froni this coun- Sheikh Abdulla already talks of electric lights, artesian wells and good motor roads and if he and Sheikh Hajead were to periodically exchange visits, I h-.ve no doubt that uiany of these ideas would become actualities. In the second place it is, according to custos, Sheikh Hamad's duty to return Sheikh ^.bdulla's visit and it might seem as if he had no desire to continue the connection if he did not now accept the cordial^invit-i.tion tendered by Sheikh ^bdulla.

During the present year a sea wall and road was completed which cut off Heepers 1 property from the sea. The Bahrain Government have gifted the area between \ their former property and the sea wall to Vespers. It is under water at high tide and the Company will have to go.the expense of reclaiming it. Lir. Bel grave proposed the following wording for de ed inclusion in the xaxsl of gift. 'The government of liahrain guarantees t 'h ^ t Captain C.G.Prior, Secretary to the Pulitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire,that at no tine m future will the frontage of the property of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd, their heirs or succeesorB under this title deed be out off from the open sea. jn the event of any reclamation work being undertaken in the future in front 01 ' to the northward of the existing road and oea-wall which now fortr the northern boundary of the town of Manama, the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd., their heirs or sucoeasora siiall have, and be considered to hold, full title to the sea-bed in front oi their present property and the frontage of the said property shall always be considered as extending upjto any new Sea-front boundary that may be formed by any reclamation workl at Uaptain Albar^s suggestion he altered it to:- Ihe Banrein uovemment guarantee that at no time within the next 20 years will the frontage ci the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, their heirs and aucceaaora under this title, be lurther cut off from the open sea than at present, except by Government buildings, aooka or any other Government engineering workswhich may become necessary, rf after the expiration of above period it is considered advisable to advance the front seawards the Bahrein Government agrees to grant to the I,:esopotami a(tj) Lesopotamia Persia Corporation* Ltd.* at t)ii a and oaoh other sub sequent move t?ie first ohoioe of a piece of land free; e^ual in size to tiieir present building^* for the purpose of erecting a new building thereon, should they not take advantage of the offer the ground would lapse to other buyers, this procedure to be repeated at each subsequent inove' , Lr* Wills has now suggested to Mr, Spence a third wording whioh runs as follows:- n The isahrein Cioverment guarantees that at no tine within the next £0 years will the frontage of the Mesopotamia x-ersia Corporation, Limited their heirs and successors under this title, be further cut off from the open sea than at present, Jjr** i j' * f If after the expiration of the above perio , . yV / r i t is considered advisable to advance the vr ' 1 . / front seawards, the Bahrein Goverrment jL / ' ^ 1 r agrees to offer, which will be made in w/ri ting, to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited their heirs and successors, a/:y land to be reclaimed in front of their premises, that is, from a line drawn with the Sast and West boundaries parallel to the same lengt?! as their present frontage, Ihe price not to exceed that - paid to ohelkh isa for the original propertyh* property jji accordanco with the uncle rat anding made with Sheikh isa at the time of the purchase of the reclaimed part of this property in 1908. This is to apply to all and subsequent reclama tions so that the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, their heirs and successors, will always have the opportunity of not being cut off from, or buildings erected between their property and the open sea^ a Should, however, the kesoipotamia Persia Corporation Limited not take advantage of the offer of the ground, the same would lapse to the Bahrein Go®erniaent H , I think Mr.Belgrave's proposal was a little too generous as it would have given the Company Lhe full benefit at no cost to themselves of any reclamation that the Bahrein Govemmerxt might hereafter consider advisable in the public interest, jn the alternative the Bahrein Grovernment. might owing to this clause, refuse to carry out works in the public interest w&amp;tch it would otherwise willingly have undertaken. On the other hand the .Mesopotamia Persia Corporation who are agents for the B-i.S.N.Coy and the Landing Company are practically a maritime concern and it would be a distinct hardship to cut off their property from the sea. The same or similar questions must frequently have arisen in connection with the reclamation work undertaken by the Karachi Port 1'rust or the Bombay i Port Commssionera./f -vv v -v British ^esidenty and uonsulate-G-ener 1, iiushire, tihe 3rd June 1928.

A a. Dear Colonel f ' The Agency, Bahrain, -j 4th November 1929. Je | ' ■ ■ I . • L jiL'iv.' -w- , - I have been worked to death ever since I arrived and the rush of cyphers in the last few days has quite finished me, I got the doctor on to the last one but he has made an utterly unintelligible mess of it and when I have time I shall have to finish it» and see what it really means. It does not seem very urgent, and was not apparently something for him to see, but he had it so mixed up that he got nothing out of it. I have com plained separately to Russell about a recyphered message that could have quite easily have been s ent in code but for the first line. In the last week to add to ot^er distractions I have had two sets of R.A.F. and one sloop. I hope to get off the letter you wanted about Persians! though it means a good deal of midnight oil, and you will, I hope to be able to settle the business before you go. The pearling season has been a failure and every one is complaining. Belgrave says he will have difficulty in making his budget figures and he is cutting down expenditure in every way. The actual cash balance is low, both in the State and the Shaikh* s account, and it is extremely fortunate that we took the action we did with the civil list. The big buyers say there is no demand from Europe and have bought little. The mefchants say that they have comibined and have deliberately not bought to keep prices down. I think there is more truth in the former and they have too much last season^ stuff unsold. The catch has been goa^L about 4 crores, but only one crore they s^id has been sold. The big merchants wanted to see me about the cul tured pearl biasiness and you will see a separate letter about it. I have sent it in rather a half boiled state so that you cd record a note shd you wish to. We argued for 2i hrs and finally arrived at the unanimous conclusions that you will see. I had got a draft before we started or nothing wd have ben settled. A lot of nasty asides from AbdurRahman QusaiM against Md Ali Zainal was a feature of the meeting.He The Shaikh seems to have been rather pulled down. He had not been attending to his diet and had beea very seedy. Apparently he had fone absolutely damn all ever since I left and only appeared twice at Joint Court and made Belgrave do everything even tell off his relatives for theft and drunkeness, a very awkward business. Abdullah has been very useful and my opinion of him increases daily. I cant make out how seedy Shaikh Isa has been. He seemed much the same but very deaf when I went to see him. I wish he wd die and we cd get a coucil going, but like King Charles he is an '' unconsciobale time a dying. ^haiich Muhammad has been very naughty indeed and has behavect (aJrYpd* s disgracefully twice. When this relative of his was run in for sel-ll ling two cultured pearls under evidence of the clearest guilf he came to court and argued. ( he was in no way concerned )^-TU8hed out &gt;1 I to the Shaikh and urged that there shd be a compromise J. and has not wtopped for a minute plaguing Belgrave about it. He has been nearly sicces^ful in his attempts to suborn Salman, for after saying that he had no doubt of his guilt, S now, after the week end, with no fresh evidence, has quite changed round. I have done nothing so far, as it is not my business, but if the man is left off, I shall tell the Shaikh that I regret to^'see that there is one justice for the rich and another for the poor J Secondly, he sold some and to the Yatims some time ago and now regt-es it. Y applied to have it registered, and it .was published for three months and he was given registrattion and plans with seals and everything. Then M woke up to it and came to B to have it all upset. B refused, in fact cd do nothing else as the title was 7 rv clear, and when he wd not go and became childish he sent g^pr- Y to talk to him. M screamed at Y to such an extent that all the people from neighbouring courts came in to the the doors of B f s office to see the fun. Finally he said that if Y wd write him a let'er asking for the land he wd gift it to him. He then flounced out without a good byp to anyone. B earns his pay.* M is being troublesome with the Baladiyyah. He started with the idea that uhey must not be allowed to usurp the Shaikh's /u, /x~ 0 f privileges or powers, but now^if he is crossed in any way behaves like spoilt Child. I have had long deputations of merchantiJ* . yr ~ V . x s (more time wasted; to say that the recent decision that they must file copies of their import certificates with the loaladiyyah for rice tobacco and ghi will hit them hard as it will give away the exact prices they have to pay, and the baladiyyah will not keep this to themselves. I have told them that they elected the baladiyyah and if they done like its work they must impress this fact on their representatives. They all try pass the baby on to me or the Bahrain Government, and I refuse to hold it. | I had one of the greatest brainwaves of an otherwise inef- \ fective carxeer over the Bolo ship. I wrote to Belgrave about it from Karachi, but when I arrived he told me that it was too late and that someone had got there first, evidently the K.B.Md Sharif, and that the Shaikh wd only say that * this was a poor year and that all trade wa^ good.* I was afraid the pass was sold, but one I night I suddenly v/oke up and laughed for I had hit on the means. I sent for .Tasim Kanoo the next day and told him that a Bolo ship ^ was coming and that it wd carry oil and sugar, and that they wd certainly undersell his oil and cre^e trouble. This is quite true# I then told him that B.S. had refused them permission to landf stuff at Jeddah, and that though the Shaikh believe that it wd help^ the port and that all trade was good, this wd not help any real Bahrain firm, and that as they wd cut prices customs wd go down, being ad valorem, and moreover that if they dumped a lot of oil or sugar here they wd unsettle the market for months. I asked him to go out and see the Shaikh and. without mentioing me see whether he cd xvoid this blow to his and A.P.O.C interests. I had ascertained that Md Sharif was not very keen on the agency but of course cd not afford to let any one else have it. Kanoo went out to the Shaikh at once ( Noon ) and the effect was eletrqi#. At 2.30 he was hammering at Belgrave* s door and asking him how soon he cd stop the ships coimng in consultation with me. Then he said * the King has fortiidden it in Jeddah, they are very bad people * and B reminded him that he had told him the samo thing thre r weeks before and he said 1 Qfi Yes Oh Yes, but this is very dangerous. Please arrange with the Baliuz at once 1 Jasim can certainly work the Shaikh. The S asked B how J',K knew, and B some a.. un .„ re . tarbaot m storif ^ ^ ^ ^ mkyi&gt; Oh yes very likely. Md Sharif n.ust have told him. I represented it to J.K. purely from the point of view of the A .P .O.C being a British firm and he being an old friend of the agency. He gives me the most grateful look whenever I see him. If this is an interference in State matters, I think you will regard it as excusable J A decree will be issued shortly which will settle the matter, but I am taking no part in J it. Belgrave tells me that a report he sent you on the pearling} trade has been published almost word for word in, I think, the ( i Near East. He says that had he cared to send it as an article he would certainly have got a fiver for it, and he not unnatural ly dislikes the produce of his pen being published for the bene fit of others. His feelings are decidedly hurt in the matter. Mine are hurt by those frightful asses the Bept of Overseas Trade publishing my letter about launches and Kanoo acimMt word for Mi word for word in the Near East. I see that I asked for for the naiies of .... * so that I may recommend their use in launches in preference to those of American manufacture. The launch engine market is at present entirely British and it is our duty to see that it remains so 1 It is one thing to say this to you, and another to say it in the colomns of the Hear East for people like Pennings to read.

't \ \0^ tuJ- Please refer to your D.0.No:109-S dated the 10th March 1931. The Qusaihis are said to be the descendents of a 'butcher and their native place is Riyadh the present capital of Nejd. They consist of five brothers: Abdul Aziz bin Hasan. Abdul Rahman bin Hasan. Abdulla bin Hasan. Hasan bin Ibrahim. Sa T ad bin Ibrahim. All have the sarae mother but the first three are real brothers and Hasan and Sa T ad (who lives at Ha^sa) are also real brothers. When Hasan the father of the first three died,his brother,Ibrahim,who was working as a camel driver at Ha^sa married his widow and had these two sons by her. All these brothers are partners,both in trade and property. The first four come and go between Najd,Ha^sa and Bahrain, but Abdul Rahman usually only comes here during the Pearling season. Sa T ad always remains in Ha^sa. In the pearl trade busi-ness . _ . they are the/associates of Rosenthal Freres. 2, The Qusaibis are of a very humble family called as ? Biyasir T ,sometimes also called t Khadh4ris T who,according to Arab custom can only marry people of low degree like them selves,even if very rich. i 3. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rahman al Qusaibi were working as servants with one LIuqbil al Idan,a well known Ha;ssa merchant owning property in Hajssa and Bahrain. Abdul Aziz is said to have started life as his coffee-boy,finally becoming his confidential clerk,and when loiqbil died it was found that he had next to noikin^ property,it having mysteriously passed into ■into the hands of Abdul Aziz,the Qusaibi r s present pig -x * ' v / office and the house near the Bank to the west 'belonging 1 to him. 4. When Ibn Sa^d occupied Has$a,Abdul Aziz and Abdul Hahraan came to Bahrain and opened an office for themselves. In the year 1335 A.H (1916/1917) they became bankrupt but Bin Sa T ud backed them and promised to pay their creditors if they failed to do so. (a). ABDUL AZIZ is a simple and wise man and is the main stay of the firm. He passes as being pious. He seldom interferes in things that do not concern him and he is liked and respected by Bin Sa T ud. (b). ABDUL RAHMAN is more enlightened,with more education $ and has a wonderful flar« for pearl dealing. He knows some French and English and normally conducts the firms business in Paris,where he casts aside the garments of orthodoxy and sallies abroad in a dinner jacket T et melon 1 . He is sensible but is very conceited. (c). ABDULLA is very intelligent and sharp but is a very mean and low character. Interferes in everything and is inclined to be boastful. He is not liked by Bin Sa T ud. (d). HASAN is very foolish and gruff. He dashes in where rfji where others would fear to tread and is of as low a X character as Abdulla. He is hot tempered and on receiving unwelcome correspondence has been known to tear it to pieces and eat the fragments. (e). SA T AD,I have never met him but he is said to be a good 1 mixer' but also of low character like his brothers Hasan and Abdulla. He always remains in Has^a. The firm are reputed to be worth fifty lakhs of rupees and their property at Bahrain cannot be less than 143. 14-15 lakhs at normal prices. Their influence is very great and growing as they hold the majority of Ncjdis at Bahrain in the hollow of their hands,partly owing to their position as Jin oa ud's agents and partly because the greater number are indebted to them. 6. The newly appointed revenue officials on the Mainland have reduced their easements as regards Customs dues to some extent^but the other important merchants are in the same boat. 7. They are on bad terms with Bin Suwailim,the Amir of QatifjandjOf course,on extremely bad terms with the new revenue officials,particularly Muhammad al Tawwil. Abdul Aziz once observed that the last time he saw Muhammad al Tawwil he was on the end of a chain and he appeared to t*-/' regajp^ his having been released from that position. 8. The firm have now collected some £.40,000 out of the £.80,000 due to them by Bin Saud and it is a mistake to suppose that he can afford to flout them as he would then be obliged to pay cash for his entire Riyadh commit/ments if he transferred his patronage to another house. 9. The firm deal in every kind of merchandise but their principal lines are the import of grain and the pearl trade.

D«Q.L t q;C/ 7^ Political Acency, Bahrain,the 28th June 19 31 The Hon'ble 1 ajoi Political Resi t T^ e 10^ cut in the Al Khalifa allowances has been Tracle ; but not without sotre unpleasentness. It will oe recalled that the cut was to be£*in pn the 1st I. uharreir,the allowances beinc reduced at the end of the month, ohortly before the cut was due to be i made I discovered by chance that Parke had written to ohaikh Ea»ad and told hir that neither his nor Shaikh laa'sjj pay nould be eiiected by it. I was obliged to take up the matter with ohaikh Kairad, since without a reduction of his pay the cut would lo/se cuch of its value and the retraining Al Khalifa would not unnaturally object to their pay beinr reduced while his was left intact. The shaikh finally agreed but owing to his evident alanr at the probably results of the cut in his father's pay I did not press it and as tratters stand shaikh Isa will continue to receive his full pay. I asked Parke afterwards what he rreant by sending such a letter to the shaikh since he clearly had no authority to go behind a decision that had already been arrived at by ISelgrave in conjunction with the Political authorities,and he could only say that he had not known -hat the cut was to take €fect on Shaikh Hainad as well as the others. This,I regret to say^l do not believe ; as it -as quite clear froir the correspondence that all would be cut equally and 1 think he was solely iroved by a desire -iate hiirseir with, his employers. &lt;r&gt;v Gulf : .Jowle B 6 H I E E</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00012d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/328</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00012d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/328</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 19/116 VIII (C 34) Bahrain Miscellaneous'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1925/1931</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (60 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>Unbound, loose pages in a folder.
