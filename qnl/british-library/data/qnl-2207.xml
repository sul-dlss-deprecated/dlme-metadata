Confidential * D.O.Ho* 3 !&gt; 7 -S of iy 32 . The Residency, Bushire, the 6th June 1932. I 9 v€ % y Please refer to your demi-official letter ^o. 344 of the 27th May regarding calls at Kuwait by Imperial Aiways. I have discussed the matter with a representative of Airways. As you will realise^they do not want to make unnecessary landings as it is on landing and getting off that accidents occur. They propose, however, to fly over Kuwait and to drop the mails probably by parachute and will land if there are any passengers either for Kuwait or from Kuwait, but otherwise will go straight on. This, I think, is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement and I hope it will suit the Shaikh. If a passenger wishes to embark at Kuwait all he will have to do will be to notify the Agents a day before and they will inform Bahrain or Basrah as the case may be and the machine will then alight and pick up the passenger.CONFIDENTIAL , D*0*No*96* Political Agency, ICweit# Dated the 23rd June 1932. Will you please refer to your Demi Official letter No.357.S. dated the 6th June regarding calls at Kuwait by Imperial Airways. 2* I am most grateful for all the trouble you have taken in the matter, and the arrangement you have been able to come to with Airways is satisfactory in the main, and the Shaikh is quite pleased. 3# There is one point however which you possibly overlooked when discussing the matter with Airways represent ative. This is the picking up of Kuwaiti 'Air Mail Bag M on the Eastern and western runs. Under your proposal any air mail letters for Kuwait will be dropped by parachute, but unless the plane stops outward to pick up pasBen^ers, our/air mail letters will still have to be sent to Basrah whether for England or India, and these be included in the local bag. *&gt;• At first sight this does not appear to be much of a difficulty were it not that we possess a very primitive land postal service from Kuwait to Basrah and vice versa. Our inward official mail ar ives at Kuwait on Saturday evening and our outward official mail leaves Kuwait on Friday at dawn (the post being closed here on Thursday night). This last catches the fast sea mail to India and the overland mail to %giand. Any air mail letters sent by this post will of necessity therefore be delayed at Basrah till the following The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Hugh Biscoe, K.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Budhire.following Wetoeaday and 'Diursday in accordance as Uiey were des'uinud for India or England - that is to say r. delay of 4 to 5 days in Basrah# 7* If therefore it is definitely impracticable for Airways to call every tine at Kuwait to pick up mails, it would be of very great assistance to us, and would get ovor all our difficulties, if you could officially approach the Iraq Postal authorities and ar an go for a second official mail to leave Kuwait on Tuesday morning, (closing hare Monday night)# 8# In other words wo want a biweekly outward mail service between Kuwat and Basrah# Ihe present single mail service from Basrah to Kuwait to stand as it is# I have in the past tried to persuade Baghdad to give us a biweekly service both ways but without success, it being pointed ait that such double service would not justify the extra expenditure that would have to be incurred# 10# I believe the present on© week service to and from Kuwait costs the Iraq Postal authorities actually £ 3250 /- p#xa* - which sum is paid to the 'Kuwait Transport Company'# One extra mil per week from Kuwait should not cost them more tiian a total of FJ300/~# II* Though I have written this in D.O. form, I trust you will be able to see your way to pu^i the matter with the Iraq Authorities, for with the Air flail taking the hrab Coast route, Kuwait is clearly going to become more important commercially as well as politically# 12# Reference the 3a st paragraph of your letter I presume Imperial Airways will appoint a local Agent in Kuwait# The./ have not done so yet#( V u»C« British rcesi&amp;ency cc consulate-lieneral isushire, the 2.9th june 1932. CJgxflx ,*iil you please refer to your jj.u. no: 96 of the 2ora; sune i-o2, regaraing calls at nuwait by imperial Airways. it is * x tninK, a little difficult and at the present moiaent very inopportune to raise the question of an aunitional motor service oetween nuwait and -asrah. firstly, as you tfiiow, the whole question of the nuwait rest and xelegraphs is at zhe present moment in the balance, xhe imperial and international communications company are rather appienensive lest the taning over the nuwait rest and ielegraphs should involve them in loss, and i think it is quite probable that if they were confronted with an. extra expenditure of ns. 300/- a month, they would certainly refuse to Wxxe it over, secondly, x imagine that the number of w . 4 - retters to oe aespatched by to as* any rostal bervice to pay an extra ns. 3600 a year for tne conveyance of perhaps 20 or 30 letters seems to me to be of question, j. am afraid that i am not prepared to press the 'Iraq post and telegraphs authorities in the matter at the very moment when i am pressing the imperial International communications company to taxe over the nost and telegraph ctuce. t would suggest that you should accept the arrangement tnat has been made and then if you can show that there is a reasonable amount of mail to be picked up at nuwait, there is -t the least doubt that Imperial Airways .ill agree to stop there regularly irrespective of passengers, but if it is a question of perhaps half a dozen letters it J-etters, it is really hardly reasonable to ask them to do so. ideut-col: n r u • ♦ licks on ^ u w A i x. ,-&lt;c - Aiiyno^ il ^ou v/aiit to t&amp;K:e any further steps in this matter you must give me some “ammunition 11 v/i th which to fight your case, in the shape of statistics as to the weight of mail that v&lt;oula be cairied#ccmwwruL.

Lest you are not quite clear how the present land postal service is run, I mi gilt mention that the Iraq Posts and Telegraph Department pay the Kuwait Transport Company, which operates a oar service to and from £ubair, the sum of R 386 O/- p.m. for the transport of mail bags once a week in either direction. This figure works out to 1(33000/- par annum, and under my sug gestion would have risen to 1^3600/-. 5* No doubt this 113000/» was deducted from the 'Gross Beoeipts' of the Kuwait Post and Telegraph Office under head 'working expenses', when you were supplied with • \ a statement sometime back by His BacneUeney the High Camai- ssioner, I believe, showing 'gross” and^net' receipts separately - see your express letter No.285/S. dated the lith May 1932 to Poroign Miniia. 0# For this reason I asoume that the Imperial and International Gcramunicationo Company if they agree to take over our Post and Telegraph Office will b© prepared to go on with the payment of this contract, unless of course Iraq agrees to go half shares.

Sir, A short time ago one of our staff, i»ieut.-Gororaander Galpin, was staying with the late jrolitical nesident in hushire while raaking arrangements for the transfer of the air from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. it transpired at that time that the shaikh of Kuwait was very keen for us to make a regular stop at Kuwait, al though from pur point of view there appears to be no reason for it. no decision was made at the time, but sir nugh Biscoe said tnat, if we would inform him of our decision at a later date, he would advise the shaikh and obtain the for mal permission necessary to observe the courtesies. in view of the expressed wish of the shaikh of Kuwait, we are agreeable to stop at Kuwait on the same basis as shipping makes occasional calls, i.e. **if inducement offers and conditions permit**, we should also be glad to have the necessary permission to make occasional calls there to pick up fuel in adverse weather conditions, even though no load was being carried to or from Kuwait. We would propose, subject to the permission being granted, to employ an agent at Kuwait who could secmre the reservations of accommodation by telegraph from our station Superintendent at hasra. We should be grateful, therefore, if our position in the matter could be explained to the shaikh of Kuwait and to Colonel Dickson, it is assumed that, in view of the Shaikh’s express wish that the service should be made avail able to passengers to or from Kuwait, no charges in the way of landing fees, etc. would be raised against us. i am, air, lour obedient aervant, 3D/ H. aurchall, Assistanf^ueneral Manager.

V 2. I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has directed me to explain to Your Excellency that the Management of Imperial Airways have generously agreed as a result of Your Excellency^ express representations and wishes in the matter,to allow their Mail aeroplanes to call at Kuwait if inducement offers and conditions permit, that is to say if there are any travellers desirous of leaving or arriving at Kuwait by Air. 3. For this purpose they propose to employ an Agent at Kuwait whose duty it will be to warn the Company’s represent ative at Basrah (or Bahrain) by telegram, so that necessary accommodation can be reserved beforehand for intending passengers from Kuwait, and in order that pilots can be told to land at Kuwait. As the Company have gone out of their way to meet Your Excellency’s wishes in this matter, especially as from their piont of view a landing at Kuwait, a port so close to Basrah, is likely to entail delay, the Hon’ble the Political Resident trusts that Your Excellency will reciprocate their good intentions, and make no charges in the way of landing fees, as is done on the Persian 2- 2 Persian side of the Gulf. 5. The Hon’ble the Political Resident further trusts that Your Excellency will grant the necessary peimission to the Company’s aeroplanes calling at Kuwait, should they desire to pick up petrol, or had weather compels them to land, even if there are no passengers to be picked up or deposited. 6* It is understood of course that the Company’s Agents at Bahrain and Basrah will give the usual telegraphic warning to their representative at Kuwait whenever an aeroplane is about to set out from these towns.

Please let me know the result of this conversation, when I will see about intervening . Please refer to your letter No.723, dated It seems to me that the matter is one which Lt.Col.H.R.P.Pickson,C.I.B., Political Agent, Kuwait.Confidential $0. 852-S of 1932 British healdeucy a Conaulate-General, Bushire, the 4th November 1932* From - The Hon 1 ble Lt*-Colonel T.C.Fowle,, iolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, In continuation of my letter Ho.718-3, dated the 28 th September 1932, 1 have the honour to state that X subsequently received a letter frora Messrs.Imperial Airways limited, London, stating th*t the possibility of dropping mails over Kuwait by parachute was engaging the Company’s attention, and requesting an estimate of the amount of mail for which they might be required to cater* X replied that 1 would communicate the information, when received, to His Maj esty * s Government• 2. The Political Agent, Kuwait, after consulting Hig Kxcellency the Shaikh and local merchants estimates that the weekly air mail from either direction ( if it is decided to drop the inward mail by parachute, and not pick up any mail bags) will not at first exceed 8 lbs. in weight, but that it is lively later to rise to approximately 16 lbs. after mails hnve been dropped regularly ior some time. 3. On the other hand, Colonel Dickson thinks that it . • *.it ia certain , and lie is supported in his belief by His Excellency the Shaikh, the representatives of the /nglo-Persian Dil Company Limited in Kuwait and the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited as well as the principal merchants of the town, that if mails could also be picked up at Kuwait, that is to say if the Mail /eroplane could see its way to land and both deliver and pick up mails, then the weight of the weekly out going and incoming mail would, reach 20 lbs,, without any difficulty. 4. Colonel Dickson is of opinion that the main profit to the Company if the air mail was to land at Kuwait would not come from the carrying of the mails so much as from passenger traffic, which he anticipates would be considerable between Kuwait, Basrah and Bahrain, provided landing is made a regular feature, and not cr. previous notice of 48 hours being given, as is the present arrangement.

Ltd., were averse to calling at Kuwait at all when the New Arab route was inaugurated recently, but that on the strong represent ation of the Hon*bis the Political Resident in the rerslm uulf, who pointed out how greatly the Shaikh bad assisted with propa ganda and otherwise, to make the new route a success, and howhow bitterly disappointed he would be if Kuwait were left out, tie company generously agreed to drop and pick up passengers provided previous notice was given (4S hours). S# The prasont putting up of tlie price of tickets between Basrah and Kuwait, does much to nullify the above con cession, for naturally no traveller likes to pay £6—0—0 fen* a journey of 70 niloa, whan the whole distance from Shaibah to Bahrain, 350 miles or more coats only £12-0-0* 9 His lircollency the hhai'Jbt of Kuwait has already drawn say attention to this point # and has asked no to try and get the natter put ri$rt, as well as set Kuwait made a regular port of call feet' both mails and passengers* - V X i nave aalo had similar representations from Mr. Chisholm of the Anglo Persian Oil Ccapony. Ltd. t and Major Frank Holmes of the Bantern end General Lyndicato, who both now reside in Kuwait, and are likely to become regular users of the Air Service between Kuwait and Starsk Lh&amp;ibah, as well as between Kuwai t and Bahrein. 8 * aoro point - I do not think the management of Imperial Airways, Ltd., have as yet fully realised the possi bilities of Kuweit, a town of 60,000 inhabitants^fa regular port of call. If one of their representatives were to visit me I think I could without difficulty convince him that a regular stop at Kuweit to pick up passengers and mils would pay easily. In my opinion not only would a good percentage of the 300 passengers to who*I regularly ia ue passports each month to Bahrain and Basrah, take tlo advantage of the Air route, but I have it on the authority of the Shaikh* that the mercantile community who all freely use Ike telegraph to Karachi, in putting through thoir rice, pearl and other commercial transactions, would certainly use the Air Mail Instead, if such were instituted. In conclusion I mi^it mention that I recently put up the questions of both 'Rates', ond^Kuwait becoming a regula r port of call for mails and passengers 5f to the Hon f ble the Political resident. He has now replied to say that be has taken up the latter question with His Majesty f s Government, but would prefer that | ®&amp;gssa*that I discuss the question of the rates referred to at the begi»&gt; ning of this letter with you before he takes any further action.

On the other hand I fear that the question of the new fares is not quite so satisfactory. These under the old arrangement were as follows:- Basrah / Kuwait or vice versa*..••• £6. Kuwait / Bahrain or vice versa £6. Under the new arrangement they have been altered to:- Basrah / Kuwait or vice versa ♦...* £4. Kuwait / Bahrain or vice versa,..*. £8. 5. When I wrote my No.773 dated the 11th November last, referred to at the beginning of this letter, and discussed the question of Bates (see paras % to 7 ) my sole intention was to try and get Imperial Airways, Ltd,, to reduce their fares between Kuwait and Basrah, to a raoro reasonable figure so as to attract-8-» attract the many travellers now regularly move between these two towns by motor ear* fly sole object was to attract this class of traveller to the air mode of travel and so benefit the oompnay* It was never my intention, nor can my letter I think be construed that way, to get fares reduced between Basrah and Kuwait, with a corresponding rise in fares as between Kuwait and Bahrain, as indeed i has now resulted* 5 . If, as now seams the case, it was always the company's intention to keep and fix £12* as the minimum fare between Basrah and Bahrain, then clearly if the fare be reduced between Basrah and Kuwait by £ 2*, that amount will have to be added cm to the fare between Kuwait and Bahrain* This point of view, I am afra£ never struck either His ^xeellanoy the shaikh nor myself when making our original representations* 7. The original fare of £0* as fixed for the Kuwait / Bahrain section, was not only eminently satisfactory, but competed favourably with the steamer fares between these two ports* There Jr was no need to make any alteration in then at all* B* Purely therefore in the interest of Imperial Airways, Ltd*, and in order to attract the maximum amount of passen^* traffic to the company, I am venturing once more to put my views forward in the matter of fares, before these are irrevocably fixed* 9* Uy new and considered recommendations, and I am voicing the views of His Excellency the Kuler also are as followss** If possible the fares between Kuwait and Basrah should be fixed £4* and those between Kuwait and Bahrain at £6*, but if this is not practicable politics, then there should be no change at all from the originally fixed fares, namely. Kuwait / Basrah ****** £6* Kuwait / Bahrain ••*••• £6* 10. It is I think quite certain that many more passengers are likely to travel between Kuwait and Bahrain thaa between Kuwai t and Basrah, throughout the year chiefly because Bahrain is the centre of the Pearl ^rade* If therefore the fare on the former route is raised to £8*, which is higher than the 1st class steamer fare, than there will no longer be any inducementinducement for the public to travel by air and we shall fail to popularize the air route as we are out to do. Kuwait become a permanent port of call for Imperial Airways, I earnestly trust that my above recommendations will be carefully considered and taken note of by the coisrpimy f s London Office. The latter have very generously met our wishes in the matter of regular calls and mail service, and I trust they will now take my advice in the matter of fares. 12. In the meantime the company may rely on my efforts and those of His kxeell&amp;ney the Shaikh to continue to popularize their ^rab Coast air service by propaganda and other means. 11 .

Tmpgn-lftl Airways - rates and making Kuwait a permanent port of call . Sir, / s¥&gt;- Reference my No.723 dated Ihe 26th October 19o2 to your address, I have the honour to inform you that acting on your advice (Bushire D.0.836.S. dated the 2nd November 1932) I represented to the Basrah Agents of Imperial Airways Limited, the question of both the high fares charged between Basrah and Kuwait by Imperial Airways, Limited, as well as the obvious advantages to be gained by the company and the public^ if Kuwait were made a regular port of call for passengers and inails. 2&lt; I am glad to be able to inform you that as a result of these representations I have been informed by the company’s Basrah Agents in their letter No.D.0.621 dated the 16th December 1932, that the London Office of Imperial Airways had decided that all aircraft on the India service should in future land regularly at Kuwait to pick up passengers and mails, as an experimental measure for 6 months. This is very satisfactory indeed. 3 . Unfortunately the question of fares did not result in quite such favourable manner. The company in fact generously met my request for a reduction of the fare between Basrd! and Kuwait and fixed it at £4. instead of the original £6. They however spoilt the concessions given by increasing the fares between Kuwait and Bahrain to £8, from the originally fixed £6.4. I have pointed out t&amp;at this latter increase will act adversely on the large Kuwait - Bahrain passenger traffic, which I anticipated would accrue as a result of Airways calling regularly at Kuwait, and have recommended that, from Hie company f s point of view if the fare between Bahrain and Kuwait could not be retained at £6, then it would be much better to keep the fares as between Kuwait and Bahrain, and Kuwait aid Basrah at the originally fixed figure of £6 for each section, so as not to discourage passenger traffic between Kuwait and Bahrain which I anticipate will always be greater than that between Basrah and Kuwait. 5. I am in hopes that the company will meet my and His Excellency the Shaikh*s wishes in the matter. 6. For your information I enclose copies of Postmaster, Kuwait, to inform the Director General, Baghdad of the new arrangement, with a view to the latter notifying London and India and getting air mails delivered and taken from Kuwait at as early a date as possible.

November, No.773, which you were so kind as to write to our Agents at Basrah, Messrs. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation. They have no doubt conanunicated to you already the general apree— ment to adopt the proposals, which you were so good as to put lorward, for an experimental period, and I trust in the main that these will meet your wishes. I would now like to reply a little more fully to the points you raise in your letter, which would make clear, I think, my Company’s objectives. First of all, you are quite correct in assuming that my Company had no intention of discriminating against Koweit when fraining t.ieir tares. I think it is fair to say that we never expected that passengers would wish to fly between Basrah and Kovneit because of the relatively cheap and easy access by road. cove£ a +h» W ^a t !T? foi i-’ ?? arbitary one intended merely to cover^the cost of landing at Koweit. You will, I am sure, understand that the wear and tear of an aircraft alighting and taking off is very considerable, and this, together with the cost of climbing again to a suitable altitude to J° u r ne y» is T uite a serious charge. Probably, you know that these large aircraft burn over one gallom of petrol'per mile, ana rather more when they are actually climbing. This is, of course, , . tne cost, but it is an indication of the order of the costs which have to be met.IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED Telephone: ZEITOUN 1297/8 HELIOPOLIS AERODROME, HELIOPOLIS, EGYPT.

December, 1932. greater The/objection to landing at Koweit, however, is the risk tta delaying the regular England/lndia service by accepting an addi tional port of call. This delay is of two kinds, which may briefly be described as direct and indirect. The simplest is the direct one, which refers to delays incurred in embarking and dis embarking of passengers, mails and freight, examinations by authori ties, such as Customs and Passports, production of new ship's papers, and the satisfying of similar official functions. The indirect delay may be due to such a e^.nse as an aircraft attempting to make up its programme by continuing its flight in the dark. If an intermediate port can only be used in daylight it follows that full advantage cannot be taken of other facilities provided on a route, and hence the aircraft may have to be held up in order to reach this particular port by daylight. The direct causes of delay are very important ones, and I am sure that Koweat will readily appreciate their significance, and take all steps that may be necessary. It will obviously be unwise to suggest any expenditure to ensure night facilities at Koweit, until we have the measure of the business which may be expected. It is, therefore, thought that the six months experimental period will give us this informa tion. During this experimental period it will easily be under stood that it may be necessary occasionally, through force of circum stances of the nature I have mentioned, to pass Koweit without landing in order to ensure that the main line service is not adversely effected. This we sincerely h pe may never occur, but it would be unwise for us not to visualise the possibility. Naturally every endeavour would be me.de to warn passengers who intended commencing their journeyIMPERIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED HELIOPOLIS AERODROME, HELIOPOLIS, EGYPT.

Failure of Westbound Air oraft to land malls. A (&gt; 0 Sir, In continuation of my telegram No.l dated the 6 th January 1933 to your address, I have the honour to inform you that in addition to His Excellency the Shaikh and the public of Kuwait, I had officially intimated to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chlef, East India Squadron and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, whose ships were all lying at anchor at Kuwait from Snd to the 6 th of January, that Kuwait had now become a regular port of call for the East and v/estbound Air first mail and that the/Westbound w Air mail” would leave Kuwait on Sth January. A&gt; S 0 2 . I did this not only on the authority of your letter No.D.0./621 dated the 16th December 1932, but oh the strength of a communication which the local Post Office had received from the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, Baghdad, who had also been informed , and had been in communic ation with London and India on the subject. X very much regret to say that the /festbound air mail of the 5th January, passed over Kuwait, but made no attempt to land and take the large mail that was awaiting it.4. Over 300 letters were waiting to be carried to the United Kingdom (mostly from H.M.S.Ships) and great inconve nience was caused to the Admiral and the fleet generally by the failure of the air craft to stop. i 5. It is not known why the air craft failed to call at Kuwait 9 as from your letter of the 16th December, I was given to understand, this would happen as from the 22 nd December. 6 * Actually on the day in question (5th January) there was a dead calm, while the aerodrome was in perfect cond ition after slight rain. Moreover the tt Sausage rt wind Indicating flag on the aerodrome had been properly hoisted as usual, under standing orders from this Agency. Nor did the air mail appear to be running late as it was 2 #p.m. (local time) when she passed over Kuwait* 7* As this is the second occasion within B days that the Air Mail has failed to land at Kuwait (see my express letter No.897 dated the 29th December 1932) it would appear that pilots have^ not been informed of the latest instructions regarding landing and picking up mails. 8 . I would request therefore that very urgent representations be made to Heliopolis, with a view to getting this matter put right without delay, else the public will lose confidence and much harm will be done, which I particularly wish to avoid. 9. In conclusion I would like to mention that the local Postmaster, seeing that Hie air craft did not stop for the expected mails, requested the Agent of Imperial Airways, Ltd., in Kuwait to charter a special oar, and take the air mail bag on to Shaibah, where it could have caught up the Westbound air mail the same evening, but apparently the agent thought this putside his province and did not do so. 10.

Dear Colonel Dickson, liTien I passed through Koweit on my way back from Karachi I had the pleasure of talking to you for a few moments on the proolem of keeping Koweit Aerodrome in good order. I suggested to you that it was possible that the Sheikh would prefer to take over this responsibility so as to ensure that the aerodrome would be fully worthy of the city of Koweit. I should be very happy to have a note from you telling me how the Sheikh receives this suggestion. I would tell you also that after leaving you I thought further of the problem of the adjustment of fares, and have made certain recommendations which I hope v/ill be adopted at a rather earlier date than I at first thought it might oe possible. Regarding this, however, I will write you more anon. Please convey my kind regards to your wife, and good wishes to the children.

I should be so grateful if you ©ould manage to arrange to get this put in good order along the line we discussed,without any avoidable delay. Yours sincerdy.2 Confidential Political Agency, Kuwait. Dated the 9th February 1933. No.30. To The Manager No.2 Operating Division, Imperial Airways Ltd., Heliopolis, Egypt 2 . Regarding the landing cir&amp;le - In my opinion this should be re-cemented as soon as possible. The cost of doing this should not come to more than £4/- I think, and I suggest your Agents here be asked to take the job in hand at once. The foundations of the circle are in good order and all that is required to be done is the putting down of a thin coat of cement £ ' thick over it. 3 . I would suggest when the work is done that Pilots be asked to avoid landing or taking off across the 'Circle' itself as this damages the cement. 4 . Your Mr. Cross who was here recently, asked me if I ooftld get the deep wheel marks on the aerodrome, which were made during the recent rains, levelled off free of charge to the Company. I should be glad if you could tell him that I have had this done, out of private funds at the disposal of this Agency. 5 # i note your remarks about lengthening the existing aerodrome, and that for the time being you suggest irkrcrfc it remain as it is - Actually the suggestion came from me to your local Agent in the first place.- 2 - 6 . For your personal information, I have done a good deal of levelling and tidying up of the ground for a distance of 300 yards to the South of the aerodrome proper, so aircraft can use this extra bit idth safety should they wish for an extra long take off. 7. Should after 6 months you require a longer aerodrome than the present one, His Excellency the Shaikh will be quite willing to give you one, three or four times the size of the existing one. The chief advantages of the present one is however that it is quite close to the city wall, and so to the town, and machines in a strong 'Shamal' wind can obtain a lot of shelter close under the wall. 8 . His Excellency the Shaikh is prepared to build a small rest house close to the aerodrome free of charge, if •your Company eventually decides to make Kuwait a permanent post of call, as we all certainly hope it will.

Dear Dickson, It was very kind of you to write on the 29th in regard to my paper before the Central Asian Society, and I hope you have not found m ything in it that has caused your work to be more difficult than it would otherwise be. I went over it with a microscope in the effort to avoid saying anything that would cause embarr as sment • We very much appreciate all that you have done and are still doing for our service, and for the liberal way in which the Shaikh of Kuwait has welcomed the service. I shall very much look forward to calling upon you sometime in Kuwait and to enjoying your renowned sea bathing. I have only eaten truffles once - in Italy - and was not then very keen on them, but perhaps the Kuwait truffles will entirely alter my outlook towards them. In any case, if I do not have the pleasure of calling on you at Kuwait before you come home, I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you on your next visit to this country. Yours sincerely. Lieut.

In regard to the air mail correspondence posted at Kuwait for the westbound direction, our present arrangement ensures due connection at Baghdad with the same week’s air despatch. Since the Kuwait Post Office began to make up air mail despatches, all air mail correspondence have duly secured connection with the same week’s air mail despatches from Basrah^with the only exception of air despatches from Kuwait on the 5th and 12th January 1933 which have missed connection owing to the aircraft not landing at Kuwait on account of atmospheric conditions. The air mail correspondence for the westbound direction despatched from Kuwait on the 16 th^instant have also secured connection with the same day’s air mail despatch from Baghdad. Even in the event of the machine arriving late and not spend- ing the night at Baghdad, precautions have been taken to ensure that air mails from Kuwait for places heyond Baghdad are taken out from the Kuwait hag and included with respective westbound mails despatched with the same machine. I have the honour to be, Bir Your most ob^iA^nt servant. t ['[ a-'- /» . » DXKECTOR GEffiSHA-L OP POSTS AND TELEOSTelephone : ZEITOUN 1293^8 P E RIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED HELIOPOLIS AERODROME, HELIOPOLIS, EGYPT. ^ .

We are very much obliged to you for all the trouble you have taken to level off wheel marks on the aerodrome, and to clean up the ground on the South border which increases the available run. It was very good of you to have managed this from funds available without making a charge on ray Company. 3. I think we should like to look more closely into the aero drome question at a little later date# As far as one can see the present site, which is so conveniently situated, will meet our immediate requirements, but nevertheless it may be as well for us to investigate fully tlje larger aerodrome which the Sheikh is so kind as to offer to give. 4. We note with pleasure the willingness of the Sheikh to build a small rest house close to the aerodrome, free of charge, if it is eventually decided to make a permanent call at Koweit.

I am sorry I still do not think the arrangement by which the mail is re-sorted at Baghdad,if this service is late,is satisfactory. Curiously enough as I write, this morning the service passed through Baghdad only staying there a few minutes, and I shrewdly suspect that there is a grave risk that your mail will not have made connection with our aircraft, but will be waiting for either the French or Dutch to come through a few days later. As you know, when we arrive v/e are so hard-pressed to complete the necessary formalities that it is really impracticable for us to start making out ships 1 papers to include late mail deliveries. However, I have tackled this again direct with the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, Baghdad, through our representative, and something may materialise.

We have agreed to do so for six months experimentally on the occasions on which no delay to the schedule would be involved by making the call. The Shaikh of Kuwait has offered to build a small resthouse at the aerodrome, provided we will undertake to make a regular call. So far we have no agreement of any sort in regard to our landings, and it seems that it is desirable for as to conclude an agreement, just as we are trying to do with Bahrain. I believe the India Office do not approve of a direct approach to Bahrain and negotiations are going on through the Air Ministry. Are the circumstances in regard to Kuwait the same, or may we in this case deal with the Shaikh of Kuwait? Since in this case at any rate the agreement would be between two willing parties, I believe that the agreement could be concluded more quickly if we could negotiate direct. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

Sir, In reply to your letter No.IA/128, dated the 4th April 1933, I have the honour to answer your questions seriatim below. (a) No precautions are at present taken beyond what the officers and craw of the aircraft, no doubt, take* (b) No night watchman is officially employed, but the Shaikh maintains a guard of six men on the town gate lying close to the aerodrome and it is always possible for a couple of men to be obtained at short notice from the co:mandar of this guard on such occasions to act as sentries and keep strangers away. It is customary to give these men a small present of ks. 2 /- each next morning. (c) See (b) above. (d) No Government or aerodrome staff is maintained at Kuwait. Up to date the landing ground has been looked upon as a Political cum Hoyal Air force aerodrome under the immediate care of the iolitical Agent. (e) No. (f) No. 2 . In the absence of any formal agreement between Eis Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and Imperial Airways Ltd., the former’s Gcnremiasnt is not bound to protect or under -the various heads enumerated take any precautions' - 2 - //&gt; r 3« nor your information &lt;ind that of your Cairo prin cipals, the following observations may be found useful and reassuring:* , (a) The Royal Air Force recently sent down a certain Captain Hunter, R.E., to survey the aerodrome pre paratory, as he said, to the Royal Air Force intro ducing some form of ground organization and bringing the markings up to date: (b) Good Law end Order exist et Kuwait, more so perhaps than in many European countries and though existing arrangements sound primitive, no 'anxiety need ever be felt for the safety of an aircraft, spending the night on the Kuwait aerodrome. (c) The Royal Air Force frequently fly down, as it is, to Kuwait from Shaiba, and park their machines under the lee of the Town wall (on the north side of the aerodrome)and rely on the guard at the gate providing the necessary watchman. 4. At the same time if Kuwait is to become a perma nent and regular port of call for Imperial Airways aircraft in future, it would certainly be desirable to introduce e proper and more efficient ground organisation than exists at present. This coulci be easily done locally be arrange ment with the Shaikh and the r oiitic&amp;i Agent, but a formal agreement would have to be come to between the Company and the Shaikh. 5. On the other hand if the Royal A.ir Force seriously intend to take over the management of the ground themselves it would be better, I think, if the responsibility of dealing with the local Government were left to them rather than that a commercial concern should do so; for the Shaikh will belikely to react more favourably and make fewer demands where His Majesty 1 s forces’are concerned. 6 . Ko doubt it could be ascertained by your Cairo principals to what extent the Royal Air Force are preparing to take over and manage the Kuwait aerodrome. 7 . actually the requirements of the Kuwait aerodrome are small anu can be summed up as follows:— (a) The appointment of one man on month salary of say Rs*30 (for preference the Shaikh*s official now permanently in charge of the city gate guard). (b) The erection of a proper steel mast with sausagesausage wind indicator on the edge of the aerodrome, to replace the small wooden iaast and loca?Lly made wind vane now existing. This steel mast to be in charge of the official mentioned in (a) above. (c) A couple of groundsmen on Hs.25/- each p.m., whose normal job would be to level off and fill in marks and ruts formed by aircraft wheels etc., to keep the ground clear cf men and animals etc. etc. on the arrival of an aircraft. These two men to be under the orders of the feate official mentioned in (a) above; and to act as watchmen should any aircraft be forced to spend the night at Kuwait. 8 . As regards the maintenance of the circle and side t markings of the aerodrome: this could most efficiently be done under Royal Air ?orce supervision as I have mentioned above. But if the latter do not wish to accept this res ponsibility , the I olitical Agent would always be prepared, to do all that was necessary each year if given the necessary funds: For this purpose, As.300/- annually would be sufficient T have th e honour to he Sir Your moot obedient servant 1.1.

Heliopolis, March 2nd,1933. The First Secretary, The Residency, CAIRO. Sir, I have received from Kuwait an enquiry for a special charter aircraft to carry pilgrims to Mecca and Medina. 1 have not, at this moment, examined the possibility from a technical aspect, but would meanwhile ask you whether facilities would be granted for such a flight, or alternatively to suitable points within easy reach of the holy cities by surface transport subject to careful consideration being given to the avoiding of flying in the vicinity of the cities.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose herein copy of a letter which I have received from Messrs. Imperial.

I have etc., (Sgd.) R.I.CAMPBELL- ACTING HIGH COMMISSIONER. Sir Andrew Ryan,K.B.E.,C.M.G., His Majesty’s Minister, JEDDA.lo. 723/200/25 British Legation, Jedda* 14th March 1933 Sir I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch lio*5 (88/16/33) of March 6, relative to an enquiry by Imperial Airways in connection with the possibility of flying pilgrims from Kuwait to the Hejaz, It appears to me to be difficult to answer this inquiry without knowing more about the project, with special reference to the question whether the intending charterer has made any preliminary arrangements with the Sa’udi Government and whether his object is to convey a single party or to organize a commercial service* I can only express general views as follows 2. It is quite within the bounds of possibility that the use of aerial transport for pilgrims may eventually be allowed* I believe that, although the scheme never materialized, Junkers considered the possibility a couple of years ago* It need not, in my opinion, be assumed that the religious objections would be insuperable or that, if Ibn Sa f ud consented to the use of such transport, he would consider it impious to allow landing in the immediate vicinity of the Holy Cities, provided that the pilots and other persons employed were Moslems. 3. nevertheless I think it extremely unlikely that air transport will become a matter of practical politics in the near future. My principal reasons are as follows (a) The King, if himself favourably disposed, would have to consider religious susceptibilities in l^ejd, just has had to do in connection with other innovations. His policy is, not to let himself be g uided entirely by extremist opinion,/ The Acting High Commissioner, The Residency, CAIRO.opinion, but to disarm it more or less gradually. ( b) The attitude of Ibn Sa* ud and liis advisers towards all schemes for the overland transport of pilgrims is exceed ingly cautious. They have gone slow with the one live pro ject of the kind, that of a motor route from ’Iraq. There are doubtless many motives for this attitude, one of which, the fear of alien penetration, would apply with special force to overland transport by air. (c) If religious and political difficulties were overcome, there would remain very considerable practical difficulties owing to the distance to be covered and the present lack of all practical facilities. When it was decided in 1930 to move the Hejaz Air Force from Darin Island to Jedda, the aeroplanes were brought round via ’Iraq and Transjordan. 4. If it should be a question of a commercial service from Kuwait, the special difficulty might arise that it would constitute pro tanto a breach in Ibn Sa*ud’s consistently followed policy of trying to starve out Kuwait by the rigorous enforcement of an embargo on trade between Kuwait and Nejd. 5. I enclose five copies of this despatch and would suggest that, unless you see objection, copies of the correspondence should be sent to the Foreign Office, Bushire and the Govern ment of India. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant. jSgd.J Andrew Ryan.88/22/33. March 25th, 1933, nnnfidential . Sir, I am directed by the Acting High Commiseioner to inform you, with reference to Residency letter No.88/18/33 of March 10th, that the observations of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on the possibilities of aerial transport of pilgrims to Mecca and Medina have now been received. 2. Sir A. Ryan considers that it is difficult to give a definite opinion on the specific case which you submitted to the Residency without knowing more about the project with special reference to the question whether the intending charterer has made any preliminary arrangements with the Sa*udi Government and whether his object is to convey a single party or to organize a commercial service. 3. Generally speaking he is of the opinion that it is quite within the bounds of possibility that the use of aerial trane- port for pilgrims may eventually be allowed and that it need not be assumed that the religious objections would be in superable or that, if Ibn Sa'ud consented to the use of such transport he wouldconsider it impious to allow landing m the immediate vicinity of the Holy Cities provided that the pilots and other persons employed were Moslems. He feels however that it is unlikely that air transport will become a matter of practical politics in the near future for the following reasons The King, if himself favourably disposed, would have to consider religious susceptibilities in Nejd.

They have already held up one project of this kind, that of a motor route from ’Iraq probably through fear of alien penetration, a motive which would apply with special force to overland transport by air.

Att he last stage it reaches the temperature of minus 142° Fahrenheit; it has tne same effect as ten times its own weight of ordinary wet ice and under ord inary circumstances a one kilo block will last seven days.

P I am enclosing for your information, interchange of correspondence with liajor (Jumbley, the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs of Iraq, My Company normally receives facilities free for the despatch and receipt by wireless or telegraph of weather reports and navigational messages, and no doubt as and when an agreement is signed with the Sheikh of Koweit such facilities will be included. For this reason I rather fear that if I agree to Major Gugibley^ suggestion a rather serious precedent would be formed. I presume that the Posts and Telegraphs at Koweit are operated by Iraq on behalf of the Sheikh. If this is so, I am sure he would wish this facility to be extended to my Company free. You will readily appreciate, I am sure, that the absence of information by telegraph from Koweit tends towards a Pilot taking the decision to fly from Basrah to Bahrein or vice versa and thus omit the usual stop at Koweit. I hope I have made it clear that it is not merely the sura of money involved with which I am concerned; it is the fact that a principle is being violated which may have repercussions at a later date in Iraq and adjoining countries.COPY Directorate General of Posts / &amp; Telegraphs. Baghdad 4th January 19^4* No.19/21 My dear Cross, The difficulty in meeting the wishes expressed in your letter BCHC/lG/224 of 26th December is that in small offices such as Kuwait we have a staff sufficient for one 'shift* only. The staff work on ^65 days per annum and I am therefore reluctant to make suggestions increasing their duties. In order to deal with such very exceptional incidents as that out lined in your letter, I might be able to arrange that the Postmaster would attend the Office for the purpose of despatching a telegram on request from your Agent. This would make your Agent responsible for keeping the Postmaster informed as to when he was required and would be preferable to any arrangement oi fixed times oi attendance as it would still be e ffective if your machine was off schedule.

We gather that it takes about three quarters of an hour to get a message through to Shaibah and we would therefore like the Office to be open, ior the despatch of the message, at about 6 a.m. local time Yours sincerely.D.O.

In the mean time I am forwarding ttf' you a letter from the Shaikh, with enclosure, which speaks for itself* 3* The Westbound plane referred to in the petition, passed over Kuwait on the night of the 18th January. The incident was due to late arrival at Shaiba, I believe, and was in no case owing to faulty Y/eather conditions here. 4. There ?/ere 122 letters written by various leading merchants of the Town which ought to have gone by the air craft, but all of course had to go by sea mail 4 days later. 5* tfhile I know your difficulties in these matters, ^ I do sincerely hope that night flying over Kuwait will only take place, in e xceptionally urgent oases and will be done on the rarest of occasions. 6* I say this in your interest solely. The Arab is a 'queer fish' and to get the best out of him, we must not let him lose faith in a concern like Imperial Airways. He is also like the Scotchman and fools very hurt , if he has to spend more money than necessary. In the present case everyone of the 122 merchants had to affix 7 annas on their letters, when 3 would have done for the mail.

February reference C-40. 2« Please assure the Sheikh that we are most anxious to land at Koweit on all occasions* but there are certain difficulties, as when the * aircraft is running late, which prevent us giving an undertaking that we will invariably make a call. 1 &gt; ^Uw^ 3* Our natural difficulties are, however, considerably increased by the unsatisfactory communications between Koweit and Sasrah, and this forms the subject of a separate letter to you which I think has crossed the one I have just received. It is usual for each airport to have either tele phonic or telegraphic communication with the next airport continuously during the time that aircraft are expected to be in the /vicinity. Our request for this normal facility has been met by the Director of Posts and Telegraphs of Iraq demanding that we pay overtime and triple rates for any tele gram we wish to send from Koweit to Basrah^. It is impossible for tfasrah to communicate at all with Koweit during the closed hours. 4. When it has been found necessary recently to fly over Koweit we have the previous day advised the Postmaster at Koweit and have suggested that the letters be despatched to Basrah by motor. This he •/nas declined to do as apparently he is not au iiorised to make the necessary expenditure. Since it is only rarely that we are forced to pass over Koweit I should have thought that it would not have been asking too much for the Postal Administration occasionally to have borne this expense in order to co-operate at difficult times. M y Personal feeling is that we have done our level best to co-operate to get the letters away from Koweit on time but that a little broader understanding and help on the Posialside might fairly and reasonably be expected. Yours sincerely. IGr.No* C—53• POLITICAL AGMCY, KUWAIT. Dated the 17th February 1934 ^ nr 0-^ J I learnt this morning that the Westbound aircraft G-AAGX landed at Kuwait at 11.5 A.M. today (17th February) and stayed only 10 minutes, leaving without any Bill of Health, seeing the Doctor or your Agent. 2. The mails for Kuwait were handed arer to the A.P.O.C. Agent who was there. 3. Actually a telegram was received last ni$it intimating that this Westbound aircraft (G-AAGX) owing to being 24 hours late, would not land here, but would fly over during the night# On receipt of this, arrangements were made by us with the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs for all Westbound air mails to be sent by special car to Basra to catch the aeroplane there. 4. This morning at 10 A.M. a further telegram was received stating the Westbound plane would land at Kuwait at 11.30 A.M. today. 5. The Agent with the Doctor arrived at the aerodrome at 11.15 A.M. to find the aeroplane just going off. 6. I realize that when an aeroplane is in a hurry or running late it may possibly have to fly over Kuwait by night but having landed here, even though before the stated time, it should abide by the Quarantine aid Postal regulations in force and await the Doctor, the Agent and mails* 7. If the special arrangements regarding our mails had not been made last ni^it, all our mails would have been left behind as has happened on more than one occasion beiore.

Hanno was most unfbrtunate and my wife who was on the ground when the accident occurred, says it was one of the most amazing experiences of her life. There were heavy clouds in the sky and it was raining on and off* The previous night we had had much thunder and listening, and clearly Kuwait was in the centre of a strange atmospheric disturbance, which might have portended an earthquake, she said. 3. On the aerodrome it was dead calm, except for the rain, and the aircraft was refuelling preparatory to proceeding to Bahrain. Suddenly, and at a seconds notice, a most violent^ (she called it a hurricane) struck the aerodrome from nowhere with the result you know of. It was accompanied by puring rain. It lasted only a short time and then stopped, as * quiickly as it came. So violent was the wind while it lasted, that the empty petrol tins were carried off and never seen again, I believe. 4. I have fixed up a tent bn the aerodrome for your people, and done my best to assist your agent with such things as baths, sweet water, bread(first day), carpets for floor and blankets (before your supply came).

On the evening of the 9th. the Agent of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd., ( your Agents in Kuwait), gave me a copy of the following telegram from **** puuulx Imperial Airways, Basrah: •Westbound delayed, Gwaaur aex&gt;arture uncertain’*. 2. At 6 A»M. on the morning of the 10th I sent the lollowing telegram addressee to Imperial Airways, Basra, thrBugh your Kuwait Agent: w Political Resident requests further arrival news 'Westbound Kuwait immediately 51 # 3. Jfo reply was received to thi*. telegram until the morning of the 11th, i.e. a delay of £4 hours, wnen Airways, Basrah, telegraphed; 'Have no ne*s of Westbound service yet”. Nothing further was received from your Agents in Basrah by the night of the Uth. X left Kuwait for Ba.rah early on the Morning of the 12th to catch the fast aan. 4. In the Meantime I telegraphed on the 10th to the Political Agent, Baniain, aeking nim to ascertain what he could of the Westbound's movements, ano on the came day2 day received the following reply: •Your telegram 10th May. Westbound aeroplane hae returned to Karachi owing to adverse weather between Owaaur and Shari ah. Tate of departure from Karachi uncertain”. Fiom this I knew, of course, that immediate arrival of the aeroplane at Kuwait was not to be expected. 5, On tfte night of the 11th T received a fur ther tele- -gram from tne Political Agent| Banraln,; •Aexonlane leaves Ketacni 0100 hours May 12th. Hopes to reach Baarah night iday 12th. Prooaoly arrives here 1400 hours.' Having received this telegram it was earsy to calculate that the westbound would arrive at Kuwait some time on the evening of the 12th. 6. It is inevitable, of course, that your aeroplanes should now and then be delayed. ( in fact 11 unnecessary risks are to be avoided it is most desirable ). but you will appreciate that intending passengers by such aera- -planes suffer considerable unnecessary inconvenience and worry ( as on this occasion }, if your Agents no not inform such passengers of the probable date ana time Of the delayer aeroplane. 7. in the present instance, as you will see. I was entirely dependent for reliable information, not on your Agents in Basrah*, the nearest headquarters to Kuwait, as I should have been, but on the Political *„t. Bahrain. W the latter was able to inform m. or) the iCth ( see paragraph 4 above ) that the Westbound hac returned to Karachi.

If the same want of information exieted all along the route then presumably all intending passengers by the Westbound were put to similar inconvenience. •formation as to the movements of the aeroplane in question would not, as far as I am concerned, appear to have been in any way the responsibility of your Kuwait every way. 10, It if;, of course, outside my province to suggest a remedy for the above state of affairs, but surely it would be quite simple for each Agent to pass on tne news he receives as t© a delayed aeroplane.

POLITICAL AGENCY KUWAIT. (7 Dated the 22nd May 1934 To Cross, Esquire, Manager, Imperial Airways, Ltd., Near East Area, CAIBO. Dear Sir, y Reference your letter No.Sl/l3/l051.BCHC, dated the 10th May 19 34, which reached me on 16th May last. the decision of Imperial Airways as to whether landing in Kuwait is safe or not, I cannot but express my deep regret at ihe contents of your letter, and at the rather hasty and somewhat unfair conclusions which have been arrived at, 2. Apparently the adverse report of Mr.Aloock, who was in charge of the damaged Eastbound aircraft which you refer to, has been taken as conclusive evidence that Kuwait is a sort of treacherous 'scylla and charybdis' or danger spot, to be avoided by all good air mariners, so to use your words, 'it has been decided to give the very fullest discretion to the commanders of aircraft to avoid calling at Kuwait if they are of the opinion that the weather conditions are such as to risk damage resulting to their charge'. 3. No reasonable person could, of course, quarrel with the above instructions to pilots, which I presume are in the nature of 'standing orders' wherever they may be due to land, but what one fears now is that the 'Kuwait DOG having been gi/en a real bad name', every pilot will natural -ly try and avoid it and so may seize upon the slightest pretext to attain this object, such as aircraft run-uing late, or the ground temperature being very high as in *Tuly While it is of course not my province to criticize or August etc. 4. With regard to the accident itself, do you not- 2 - do you not think that the Company could, with some advantage to themselves, have asked me to furnish a report on what actually happened from a landsmans point of view* I refer to the first accident ®ned also the secGBndl and subsequent accident to the aircraft* 5. I could also have been of some assistance, I think, in providing the Company with some of the Meteorological information which they apparently desire, seeing that I and the various Political Agents at Kuwait before me have kept full and careful official records of maximum and minimum temperatures for every day in the year since 1912. These include full records of rain, wind, and aneroid Barometer readings# 6# I myself have been in Kuwait for 5 years (except for a period of 3 months) and my personal experience of weather phenomena is fairly complete. I only recently took upon myself to advise your local Agent to suggest to Imperial Airways that much highly useful information regard ing Kuwait and the Persian Gulf generally can be obtained , from the book known as 'The Persian Gulf Pilot', which \ every captain of a warship and passenger steamer operating in the Gulf has in his possession jo ^ 7. Mr.A1 cook had certainly very bad luck when he had his 'first' accident* Of this there can be no doubt* / It was an 'act of God' pure and simple, as I wrote and told you at the time* But it mi^it easily have happened any- tfhere else in the world;for the weather was stormy with heavy clouds and thunder and lightening about. In other words he happened to strike a 'depression' presaging rain* The 'second' accident in my humble opinion, as a landsman with no knowledge of aeroplanes, could have been avoided if Mr.Alcock had had more experience of the Persian Gulf* Everyone living in the Gulf region knows that in the Spring months the wind is mostly a gentle one from the south-east (KAUS). It is in the nature of a draught of cool sea air filling the hotter vacuum of ’Iraq. At theAt the same time everyone knows also that in Spring and during the nights especially, one frequently gets a sudden and sharp change of wind, and it starts blowing from the north-west (SHAMAL). The blow may continue for an hour, 24 hours, or 3 days as the case may be. This Shamal usually comes with force (anything up to 45 miles an hour). Though one does not like to say it, I myself warned Mr.Alcock twfcce to place his aircraftfacing the north-west each night as any danger that came would be from that quarter. He, I fear, neglected my warning and his second accident resulted. 8. Before concluding and without any intention of being ungenerous or unkind, I should like to say that my wife and I felt rather hurt at the way our efforts to make Mr. Alcock and his gallant n shipwrecked crew” oomfor teb le, were received. Actually(a) tfe invited the whole crew to our house, and prepared beds, breakfast, lunch and dinner for them on two successive days, but no one turned up.

No one knows better than my wife and I^that Mr # Alcock was upset and almost off his head with worry during the period of his enforced sojourn here* He no doubt felt he could not leave the aerodrome for a minute. One would however have liked and appreciated a small word of thanks before he left for what we tried to do for his and his mens comfort. Kuwait is a very out of the way Arab Town and tie means at our disposal for making 'castaways” comfortable, are very limited.

I agree that it is very probable that pilots will be nervous for some little time to come of landing at Koweit when conditions appear adverse. My Company's pilots are, how ever, exceedingly experienced, and the fears you express that they may seize upon the slightest pretext to avoid Koweit I anticipate will be un- founded. 3. I think I should take this opportunity again to put on record that the unsatisfactory telegraphic communications at Koweit aggravate the problem of a call at your port. 4. Apart from any physical conditions it is opportune to review the results of commer'cial operations at Koweit. The receipts from this call I regret to say have not come up to the antici pations expressed in various communications, and indeed the additional expenditure involved in making this landing has not been balanced by the receipts. Let me hasten to add that this has not in any way influenced the present instructions to my Company's Captains of Aircraft, but its bearing on the problem as a whole must not in the future be overlooked. •AipERIAL airways limited.

I would assure you that I had no idea you were an eye witness of either the first or e second accident, or most certainly 1 would have written asking you to be good enough to give us details of what you observed. Even at this late date my Company would welcome any information you can give. 6 * Persian Gulf Pilot* was very carefully studied during the survey of the route through the Persian Gulf and the essential informa tion absorbed by the pilots operating in this Area. Cap am Alcock has had continual experience between Cairo and Karachi through the Gulf for the last five years. I ^* The responsibility for the provision of Meteorological data on the route between Cairo and India is arranged as followst- (a). Cairo to Basrah - Superintendent, Meteorological Service (Air Ministry), Middle East &amp; Iraq, Royal Air Force, with Headquarters at Cairo. (b). Basrah to India - Director, India Meteorological Department, Poona 5, with The Meteorologist, Karachi. Doubtless the records you have compiled at Koweit are collected by the latter who in his turn advises us of weather conditions likely to be expected. The science of Meteorology is now such a specialised subject that to obtain its full value the interpretation is necessarily in the hands of experts. Local knowledge is an invaluable aid, but the analysis of observations made over a large area embodied in a synoptic chart admits of remarkably accurate forecasting of conditions, and it is improve ment under this heading to which we must look in order to obtain definite information of forthcoming storms. The Meteorological Superintendents referred to earlier in this letter are both being asked to co operate to investigate the practicability of these Predictions.p E RIAL airways limited. BCHC/l6»1153.

Captain Alcock*s wife was expecting to have a child. During the time that her husband was on his way from India she fell down the stairs and was taken to hospital and a pre mature birth was expected. We took the best possible advice and were assured that there was no danger to the woman, and under the circum stances decided that the best thing to do was not to pass any warning to Captain Alcock but to relieve him of any anxiety by keeping him in ignorance. Unfortunately, as often happens in such cases, advice reached him by round-about | . '■ ; . , * ^IPERIAL airways limited. CONTINUED NO., 2 sources and he was probably a great deal worried by this as well as by all the difficulties with which he was actually contending. He returned, to Cairo and a day after his arrival a seven months old baby boy was born. This lived for nearly two days and then died. Naturally he was very distressed at the loss of their first child and we did not press him to give us details of what had occurred at Koweit until he had recovered. Unfortunately this coincided with the needs for him to leave Cairo on another service to the South owing to other difficulties we had encountered, and it was not until Friday the 25th. May that I had an opportunity for the first time of talking to Tim. (ibis was the day prior to my receiving your letter of the 22nd. May). It was then that I ascertained that he had not written personally to thank you for all you had done to help. It came out because I was asking him the names of people to whom he would like us to write officially, and in addition to describing your kindness he mentioned the help given by our friend Haji Williamson. He said he would certainly write to you straight away and I anticipate he has done so. He left for Central Africa on the regular service early on Saturday morning before your letter came so I have had no opportunity of discussing it with him. I think you know me well enough to accept without further words my personal regrets that Captain Alcock should have behaved so stupidly, and perhaps you will let me add my Company’s very best thanks for all Mrs. Dicksonland your own kindness in helping on this very ctiffieult occasion. Yours very sincerely.A o No.C-200. POLITICAL AGHJCY, KUWAIT. Dated the 30th May 19 34.

He at the same time pointed out that were it not for the obstructive tactics of the EhaiKh of Kuwait, he (Oumbley) oould arrange to run a telephone line through to Kuwait inside a week, which would settle all hl s Cross’ anxieties 4. Cross naturally turned to me and In two private notes written some time back, astesd if X could not get the Shaikh to be reasonable about the telephone. On both ocoasions T wrote and told Cross briefly that Important negotiations with the 'Iraq Government wore going on as to the future of the Kuwait Post &amp; Telegraph Department (actually managed by ’Iraq) and that until these were satisfactorily oonoluflod, and 'Iraq choee to meet Kuwaits demands half way and in reasonable spirit, the question of the 'Telephone' must remain in abeyance• 5* Cross accepted this, until the recent accident happened ^en I understand Oumbley again got at him and said 'I told you so, if only you had brought pressure to bear on the Sheikh, you would have had your telephone going by now, and probably no accident would have Imppened. 6* Cross now is trying to bring the necessary pressure, caring nothing as is quite natural, for a political dispute between Iraq and Kuwai t, but only for his telephone. 7. His veiled threat that Kuwait might have to be left out as a future port of call, is obviously the form of 'pressure' he is trying to bring on us* 8.

AS your own arrangements for accommodation of passengers detained here addc are nil, the whole burden of accommodating and feeding your other passengers fell on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agent here, Mr Yousif Al Ghanem .-This implies no reflection on your agent here (through Mesopotamia^corporation) Mr D’Souza, who however appears to have no facilities whatsoever for dealing with such emergencie At Mr Al Ghanem’s request I put at his disposition an em^ty house of mine, wh&amp;tt by great exertions he made six of your passengers tolerably comfortable* Of the remainder two Arab passengers, acquaintance of mine, were given dinner by me and subsequently accommodated by friends and two Indian passengers were accommodated in Mr Al Ghanem’s own house* Tie business of thus supplying your ten passengers with auitable accommodation, beds, bedding, food and drink at no notice (your machine had been signalled as flying over) was no light one* It kept Mr Al Ghanem and his family occupied until after midnight, apart from his duties, as Anglo-Persian Oil Co: agent, in refuelling and attending to your machine* I hope that you will duly recognise Mr Al Ghanem's exertions on your behalf, in addition to re-imbursing him for his out of po eke t exp ens es • (2) I have felt it necessary to express the above hope because I have not yet received any recognition of similar action taken by myself and my staff when your eastbound plane was delayed here for 24 hours on Jth April* On that occasion I was myself on the aerodrome as a colleague of mine was one of your passengers* I arranged to accommodate^ him myself, and, knowing again your agent’s position, offered my second^ as accommodation for the remaining passengers, six in number as far as I remember* All your passengers therefore were supplied with accommod ation, beds, bedding, food and drink at my Company’s expense and by the exertions of my staff* As far as I know you have not yet recognised thii fact, which is why I wish to ensure that Mr Al Ghanem is not similarly treated* In view of the close relations of your Company and mine I did not feel it necessary to report the matter to you before, anticipating that you would be the first to take the matter u* with me, when I would refer the question of charges, if any, to my head office. You should know that on the evening of your plane’s detention on 14th June, I with the Political Agent and others were dining with the Shaikh of Kuwait (H.E. Sir Ahmad Al Jaber As Subah KCIE CSI) . when he heard that once again all arrangements for your passengers were having to be dealt with by myself and my Company’s agent, he expressed great surprise that your Company had not yet any organisation for such emergencies. He asked what your Company had said or done following our entertainment of your passengers on Jth April, and when I replied, expressed very great surprise. I am well aware of the difficulties of your Arab Coast route, and the fact that Kuwait is not a fully-scheduled port of call* I suggest however that some organisation is desirable for the comiort of your passengers if they are detained here* The rent of a nouse such as that in which I have accommodated your passengers now on two occasions is only R 8.350 P*a. and very little expense would be necessary to make it suitable -for emergency habitation such as you have in hsnxein, where I have your charge of £*1-10“0 per day on various occa^ionb-- 2 - * (3) A matter unconnected with tfcie above t but wiiich I feel will interest you, is as follows. Ihe westbound airmails were ready for despatch on 14th instant when your as^zit here was told from JBasrah about noon to inform the ibstMaster that your plane was flying over to Basrah at about 5 P»ei« and that the mails &lt;sould be received there in time by car, if the Past-master would provide one. As the ibst master has instructions not to incur such expense (say Rs.lJ) the mails would not have gone had not I happened to be sending a car into Basrah, which I instructed to take the mails, which included not only my own but those of H.M.S.Bideford, lying in Kuwait* Here again I am well aware of the situation between yourselves and the post office, lut I venture to suggest that, on occasions when your plane has to fly over Kuwait yet there is sufficient time for the mails to reach Basrah by car, your agent might be empowered to send the mails by car. The occasions would be very few, the expense very small, and your clients very much gratified.
