Bullard to Mr. Eden .— (Received February 4.) /TtT -&lt; r'* \ .-v ^ «7 / (No. 18.) Sir, Tehran, January 15, 1942. THERE have been several articles in the Persian press recently about the census and the population of Persia. One writer points out that the recent census of the thirty-five largest towns shows their population to be only 2,264,851, and he concludes that the total population of Persia can hardly exceed 10 million, whereas people had been led to think that it was between 15 and 18 million. This estimate was, in fact, current, and the late Shah even declared to the Egyptian Ambassador that the population would be found to be at least 20 million. In of the forceful methods favoured by the late Shah, it might have been supposed that he would find means to inflate the figures of the census, but there is no ground to suppose that they were falsified. 2. The same writer points the high rate of illiteracy as revealed by the census, and quotes these figures :— 3. Another writer reminds his readers that the heavy taxation of the late rdgime was, in fact, even heavier than was supposed, because it was spread over a much smaller body of people than the authorities counted upon. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Bagdad and Angora. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. 95 n,o t *!/ /JL [26—25] ■* £»d. jpi Dia ' \ F*c*r/N.. My Lord, I have the honour to triform you that a census of the population of Tehran and its suburbs was taken on the 1st -arch 1940. This is the first tine that a census, conducted in anything like a scientific manner (i* e. a counting of heads within one single day}, has ever been taken in this country, with the exception of an experimental census, done last year in the town of Kfiuhan, as a prellainary to the ooapX.tion Of plans for that of Tehran. 2. Questionnaire forme were delivered by the police to householders a nuaiber of days before the date of the census. These foras had in general to be coopleted before the census, and returned to the authorities, who made a house to house visit on the actual day of the counting, and compared the completed forms with the actual facts. Each resident was required to remain between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. on *arch 1st within the bounds of the house from which he had submitted a form, unless a special paae (for doctors, midwives etc.) had been obtained beforehand. All shops and businesses, including the dislocation was not very greatly felt. The first figure officially announced in the Ministry those bay* oriental population is well well accustomed to fending tor its®li, of Justice Onzette for the 6th March wae 531,246.

Ko details were given. This is stated to he ^actual’' population of i'ehran ana its suburbs on March 1st, 'actual* being defined as exclusive of nortaal residents who were absent on that date, and inclusive of non-residents who were present# The only available definition of w suburbs H is 'up to eix kiloaietres frojs the city'; this presumably means from the edge of the urban area that in fomer cays was clearly defined by the now demolished walls, rather than from the centime, and It would exclude the suiamer stations collectively known as hiuran, as well ns lhahr-i- ,ey v ihaii Abdul AzIhj). 4 # xt was stated in the press that &amp; census taken in 1884 revealed a population of 106,482, and that subsequent countings in 1322 and 1932 resulted in the figures 160,0 -0, 210,000 Kid 310,139 respectively. X m not In possession o: recorus covering the first three of these occasions, hut fro» those avaiishle for 1332 it is evident that the counting was not done in the strict manner of a uropesn census, out was spread over a considerable time. ’fheae earlier figures, though they noy well represent approximate statistics of the population at those dates, must t lerefore be taken with reserve. 0n the other hand, while making due allowance for the evident fact that Tehran has greatly increased (at the expense of several provincial towns) under the present regime, I find it impossible to believe that it has increased by as much as 230,000 in eight years (nearly 80 persons per aay;, or that it amounts at present to over half a million souls. A great deal of the development of the city and its environs has oeen in ^ wide streets and pretentious the direction of eubstituting .viue s / house® n5 - 3 - houses shops ox* public buildings for previously congested bazaar' quarters, and has involved a great deal of cie olltlon a * wel ^ as construction. The primitive un-piped wnter supply would alone render such a prodigious increase of residents unlikely* The figures have official sanction, the census was elaborately carried out, anti 1 have no positive evidence to set against this; but I cannot resist the impression that the remarkable copperloan wit i previous estimates owes something, whether by belittling the past or by exaggerating the present - or both, to the propaganda that claitas the inauguration of a golden age of prosperity for the present regime, and that half a million was the small ‘st figure thought respectable for the capital of the King of Kings* 6* A copy of this despatch ie being sent to the Secretary to the Government of India in the xtemal if fairs .department, Simla* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, My Lord, Your Lora ship's iaost obedient, humble Servant, { -gd) . . fttilaru14; 6130 QS 0 ^ ^ a**?

Reference:- Memorandua toy Mr* J.p. Summer scale dated 2nd March, 1934, on ths figures and tables published toy the Tehran Municipality in respect of the census of 1933*Copy of ’JemGrandma by Mr* J.p. Summerscale on tha aubjeot of the Tehran Census of 1935. 1 have read through the text and examined the various tables in the volume published by the Mvinicipalitj about the Census of Tehran la 1933. The major problern i» t of course, to estimate the accuracy of the figures. The book states that the census, was made by means of two sets of papers *• one issued to every Individual and one to the heads of families. No one, however, can confirm that individual papers were issued. Fifty secondary school boys were employed to distribute, explain, and help fill in the forms. The advance in general education during the last ten years should, it is stated, render the present census more reliable than that of 1923. However the figures were obtained, the Municipality has certainly collected a mass of information, which is presented in a coherent form. A brief summary of the main tables followsj- JBmrlier Censusesi The first census of Tehran was made in 1883 (the date 1773 in the index must be a misprint - the actual table refers to 1883) when the population was estimated at 106,482. A second census is mentioned in 1903 when the population was estimated at 160,000 (this increase in twenty years seems improbable; possibly the first census was very sketchy). In 1923 the Municipality undertook the census on what are described as scientific lines and returned a figure of 196,266. This figure refers to the population within the ramparts; the density of population is said be 80 persons per hectare. /CensusCensus of I 9 aa» v The population of Tehran city (within the limits of the old ramparts) is given as 210,000 (excluding police, prisoners, paupers and diplomats) which la aaid to give a density of 105 persons per hectare* Houses: There ax'e 28,045 habitations comprising 170,992 rooms. In these live 68,084 families or 262,000 persons. On the average, therefore, each house contains six rooms occupied by two families which total nine persons. Tne populati o n of Greater Tehran is 510,139. At the time of the census there were 1,600 transients present in Tehran. Sixty eight per cent of the families numbered from one to four persons. Thirty two per cent of the families numbered from four upwards. Average family is six persons. The number of male and female servants is given as 14,827. The surplus male : Kale population: 133,940. Female population: 131,199. Religious classification; Moslems: Jews; Armenians : goroastrians: Christians; 261,614.

'British”, of course, include Indians. The figures for Swedish and Danish are obviously too low, even for pre-Kampsax days. Occupation Distribution : Long tables are provided, giving in great detail how many bakers, barbers, weavers, etcetera, there are. The following are the totals of the groups which are minutely subdivided:- Agriculture: 6,888. Industry: 76,395. White collar(?) workers: 4,987. Transport: 17,731. Merchants: 16,063. Shopkeepers: 64,118. State and Municipal employees : Army: 7,686. ) Police! 3,056. ) Total: 11,061. ) Amnieh: 410. ) Civil; 29,767. Diplomats and Staffs ; 460. General: Tiiere are also elaborate tables showing age distribution in the trades; tables showing number of married, divorced and single persons, heads of families, etcetera, graphs showing the density of population in /differentdifferent dietriots of the city, the number of employers of labour, etcetera. The following table shows the number of peraone possessing more than one wife:- 51,443 men possessing 1 wife. 1,031 102 16 6 1 1 ditto, % tf 2 wives. 3 * 4 M 6 •» 8 « 18 ’* The Solomons are said to be mostly well-to-do peasants in the immediate vicinity of the city. In fact the book is most elaborate and treats almost every aspect of population, its distributioi its occupation and its social divisions. There is no guarantee of accuracy but possibly its w comparative* figures are useful in giving a fairly accurate picture of the growth of the population, the occupational distribution, and such averages as the number of families per house and persons per family.

The first document is a memorandum written in 1934 by John Percival Summerscale, the Counsellor (Commercial) at the British Legation, Tehran. He comments on the figures and tables published by the Tehran Municipality in respect of the Tehran population census of 1933. This is followed by two dispatches written in April 1940 and January 1942 by Reader William Bullard, the British Minister at Tehran. He describes the conduct of the population census of Tehran taken on 1 March 1940, reporting on some of the published census results, as well as press commentary in Persian newspapers.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
