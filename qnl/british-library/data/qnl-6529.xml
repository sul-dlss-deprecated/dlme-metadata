In reply to your letter* of 24th instant, I have the honour to inform # Not printed. y ou that I have examined the papers of the S.S. “ Baluchistan,” which you seized on the 24th instant at 7 a.m., and I find that the seizure was in accordance with the orders of Her Majesty’s Government, and that that portion of the cargo which you have seized and deposited in my custody was properly seized in accordance with those orders. The seizure wag made by H.M.S. “Lapwing” solely in the territorial waters of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat and in accordance with his proclamation of the 13th instant. I have, &amp;c., G. Eagan, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent and Consul, Maskat. Officer Commanding H.M.S. “Lapwing,” K.N., Maskat Harbour. B. Extract from general letter from H.M.S. “ Sphinx,” No. 4 of 11th February 1898. H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” at Muscat, 11th February 1898. ****** I will now proceed to give you my impressions and ideas on the state of affairs. Muscat, being what is called a free port, has been an emporium for arms for some time past. Merchants at Bushire have local agents here, chiefly Bunias, who reship the arms to their order, to various ports and places in the Gulf. Native merchants in Kuweit and Bunder Abbas, for instance, have agents at Muscat, and they often come down themselves and take the arms away, either by a buggala, or, in the case of Bunder Abbas, by a British Indian steamer even, very probably in the latter case the arm chest would be remarked as containing “ hardware.” I have often spoken to the different agents who have been here on this subject, but they never apparently took any interest in the matter, and, at any rate, did not see their way to putting a stop to it, although they may have represented it. The larger annual increase of arms imported was men tioned and noted in their official trade reports, and that large numbers were res nipped to the Oman and Pirate Coasts, and also to Persia by native craft, but no mention is made of any going direct to the Mekran Coast. The Sultan, of course, reaped a very considerable benefit from Custom dues owing to this large import, indirectly though, as his customs are farmed out to two Bunias. S. 13. A Political No. 1903/98.49 With regard to Bushire, as you are aware, the Persian law prohibiting the importation of arms into that and other Persian ports has up to now 'been allowed to drop out of sight entirely, for the simple reason that it brought such a large revenue into the hands of tbe officials there and the Persian Government, or, in other words, the Shah, could expect and get a great sum when the port at Bushire was practically put up for sale. At the time I was last at Bushire there was a rumour that the Malek intended to enforce the law and confiscate some thousand rifles, but others interested in the trade pointed out to him that if he did so the trade in arms would cease, and that he would lose more in the iong run by the falling off of the Customs’ dues than he would gain by the sale of the rifles confiscated so the matter was dropped. That is how the case rested till the British and Persian Governments arranged to bring tbe law into force, and then it only remained to make arrangements with the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheik of Bahrein to co-operate with these two governments to put the restriction on the importation into Persia and British India into working order. You will have been informed of the seizure of arms at Bushire, and also of the agreement come to with the Sultan of Muscat and his affirmation of it, that with the Sheik of Bahrein has probably by now been made as the Besident was at that place on 4th instant by the latest advices. Unfortunately the agreement with the Sultan was not in force in time to seize the cargo of the S.S. “Tresco,” but happily so in the case of S.S. “ Baluchistan.’ The cargo of arms originally consigned to Bushire are still at the Consulate pending instructions. I notice in a telegram sent to you by Commander Fraser from Cbarbar on 30th January, he states that cargo for Muscat in Custom House will not be removed “ without naval or consular authority.’ Commander Fraser also informs me that a similar statement was made in a letter of proceedings from Lieutenant and Com mander Carr, and forwarded to you. I regret to say that this is not the case. On my arrival I made strict inquiries as to whether the Muscat cargo in the Custom House was still intact ; my interpreter told me that some of the cases had been broached. The British Consul informed me that there had been no written agreement with the Sultan in the terms mentioned in the telegram referred to, hut that he had promised to let the Consul know if he allowed any of the arms to be taken out, which, I believe, he did on one occasion; but by the 7th instant they had all been taken out by the respective owners by order of the Sultan. This piece of information I gave to the Consul who had not heard of it, but it was confirmed to him on his visit to the Sultan on the 8th. I also suggested to him that he should obtain from the Custom Bunia a list of them, and to whom they belonged; the greater portion of them were consigned to the agent of Malcolm &amp; Co., of Bushire, and who is the chief farmer of the Customs, so it is not difficult to see how the matter was worked; but at the same time it appears to me a distinct breach of faith on the part of the Sultan, and not consonant with the tenor of his promises. There is no doubt a general scare here at the present moment, and the sale of arms to Arabs, &amp;c., is very small, but still it is not at all a difficult matter to smuggle a few arms in a trading boat laden with cargo as they would take the stock and barrel apart and stow them in the centre of a bag, so that, not withstanding the rigorous patrol I have established in this port, and in Muttra, I fear they manage to pass a few out; at least so I was informed by a friendly native. In order to assist the ships in their search, I further suggested to the Consul that he should press on the Sultan that a careful supervision under his orders should be undertaken of all vessels leaving Muscat and Muttra, informing tbe Consul when any vessels were about to depart. I, however, find it most difficult in these and other matters to make the Political Agent realise in what way he can materially assist the Navy in carrying out their orders. The dealers in arms at Muscat are Bunias (British subjects), Persians, and Baluchis, the two latter classes being subjects of the Sultan.50 biting the now been t brought le Persian great sum ;he Malek but others e in arms falling off mfiscated, rernments 1 to make ahrein to &gt;n on the nd also of tion of it, ie as the n time to j case of ishire are a sent to tates that naval or a similar and Com- ; the case, 'go in tho the cases i been no telegram e allowed occasion; re owners nsul who lultan on e Custom ortion of and who le matter breach of or of his the sale It matter mid take ,hat, not- , and in rmed by ’ further a careful i leaving about to make the Navy in &gt; Bunias 3s being As a precautionary measure I suggested to the Consul that he should order all the British subjects in the place to register the number and marks, &amp;c., of all arms now in their possession, and to give them strict injunctions that none are to be sold without his previous sanction; now this does not appear to me to be a very arbitrary measure, yet he said he had no authority for so doing. That being so it is useless to ask the Sultan to do the same with regard to his subjects dealing in arms; in no other way that I can see is it possible to keep a touch on the arms at present here, or to trace any that may be hereafter discovered elsewhere. Although His Highness the Sultan will receive a considerable sum from the Indian Government for his apparent willingness to co-operate with us in the suppression of the arms export from his country, and also a recompense for possible loss to him through the decrease of the Customs’ dues, it does not appear to me, and I have made every inquiry, that he has in any one way, small or great, taken any measures to prevent the export of arms. He has signed the proclamation to his subjects, and there his action ceases. I point all this out particularly to show what little power or influence the representatives of our Government have over him, and it is rumoured with very considerable amount of truth, that he looks upon and uses the Erench A r ice-Consul as a sort of legal adviser on questions arising between the British Consul and himself. Formerly he was satisfied with a wish expressed by word of mouth from our Consul, but now everything must be in writing, which may be shown to the Erench Vice-Consul. I give another instance of how impossible it is for any secrecy to exist in communications between His Highness and the British Consul, and vice versd. The Sultan’s secretary, who writes and translates the letters sent and received, is the Erench Vice- Consul’s moonshee brought by him from Zanzibar. I do not for a moment wish to imply that the Consul is in fault. In retaliation he also hears things concerning the Erench Vice-Consul, but I take it they are of little value. ****** I have received an intimation from the Besident that the treaty with the Sheik of Bahrein (Esa) has been concluded on identical lines as that with His Highness the Sultan. ****** I have, &amp;c., C.

Whereas this day the twenty-third of Dhul Kadah 1315 A. H. (15th April 1898) we, that is to say, I, Saeed bin Muhammad the Wazir of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat and I, Badr bin Seif, held a court by the order of His Highness Seyyid Feysal bin Turkee Sultan of Muskat for inquiring into the circumstances under which certain arms and ammunition ex S.S. “ Beluchis tan,” of Swansea, No. 101,951, were seized by the British man-of-war “ Lapwing,” on the first of the Ramadan 1315 A. H. (21th January 1898), near this port in the territorial waters of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, and whereas we have examined Lieutenant Commander G. Carr, R.N. (C. M. G.), Commander of the Lapwing,” and heard bis evidence on solemn affirmation, and have examined the bills of lading, manifest, and papers and telegrams which the above-mentioned Commander produced, we find after a full inquiry and deliberation as follows :— 1. That the said arms and ammunition ex S.S. “ Beluchistan ” were seized by the British man-of-war “ Lapwing.” 2. That the seizure was in every respect legal and in accordance with the permission given by His Highness the Sultan to British men-of-war at the request of the British and Persian Governments. 3. That those arms and ammunition were intended for Persian ports. 1. That the alteration in the port marks of destination on the cases took place (was carried out) during the stay of the S.S. “ Beluchistan ” at Port Said on or about the twelfth of Shabaan 1315 A. H. (6th January 1898) with the intention of misleading as to the true destination of those cases ; but such alteration did not confer any immunity on them from seizure in accordance with the above-mentioned permission. 5. That the arms and ammunition seized are the very ones mentioned in the original manifest which is attached to this decision. Major (C. G. E.)

Report on the Traffic in Arms and the steps recently taken for its suppression. Our annual trade reports show clearly that the importation of arms into the Persian Gulf has been steadily on the increase, and from the extracts of our returns for the last five years, noted in the margin,* it will be seen that the admitted value of arms and ammunition imported rose from Rs. 13,120 in 1892-93 to Rs. 23,87,195 in 1896-97. 2. The significance of the great extension of this particular traffic had not escaped the notice of my predecessor, Colonel Wilson, and I would invite f No. 64, dated 30th September 1896; attei ^ tl&lt;)n to hls remarks m lettersf No. 88, dated 12th December 1896. noted on the margin to Hor Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and I gather that Colonel Wilson was fully alive to the danger of allowing the free importa tion of arms of precision into the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf, which contain so many elements of disorder, though he was, at the same time, desirous to protect British interests. The Persian Government had in 1881 forbidden the importation into Persia, but had not properly enforced the prohibition, which was evaded by the importers with the connivance of the local authorities. It was well known that the amount obtained yearly for the farming of the customs in Bushire and other Persian ports between the Shat*ul-Arab and the eastern frontier of Persian Baluchistan, was based on the assumption that a large revenue would be derived from the duty on arms. This duty was variable, according to the will and caprice of' the particular Governor who took up the contract, and depended entirely on his power to squeeze the importers. The latter were fully aware that their proceedings were illegal, and were prepared to secure the good will of the local Persian authorities by occasional presents, and by paying a much higher ud valorem duty than they are, under treaty, called on to pay on other goods. 3. The position then appears to me to have been as follows :—The traffic in arms has been illegal since 1881, and both the Government and the importers were well aware of this ; but the Persian Government reaped a certain profit from the trade, and were ready to take this and wink at the evasion of their own regulations till such time as it suited them to re-enforce them. The importers were aware that they were evading the laws of Persia, and that every consignment of arms was liable to confiscation; but they reaped enormous profits, and hoped that by sufficient payments to the local authorities, they would be able to continue to make sufficient to cover any future possible loss, should the Government suddenly change its attitude. A. merchant here, who has been engaged himself in the trade, told me confidentially that this was their position, and I have every reason to believe that such was the case. 4. The firms engaged also imported other goods, and exported grain and other produce of Persia. The guns were not as a rule paid for in money, but in kind, and there is no doubt that their importation stimulated trade, and encouraged exports, as the tribes were ready to part with almost anything in order to get rifles in return. The possession of a rifle and the 200 cartridges which accompanied it, are considered essential possessions for a grown-up man, and no one can hope to obtain a wife till he can produce them. The object for which these arms are purchased is to assist the owners in obtaining plunder, and in taking part in tribal conflicts. Armed men have no difficulty in obtaining employment in the followings of important leaders, such as AH Khan and Hyder Khan, &amp;c., who know that their own influence depends on the number of followers they can muster, and they have, undoubtedly with this object, encouraged the sale of arms among their people. 1892- 93 - 1893- 94 1894- 95 - 1895- 96 1896- 97 - Rs. 13,120 67,770 - 7,18,050 - 12,26,740 - 23,87,195I l.l — 53 . for arms into steadily on extracts of five years, ill be seen arms and ose from Be had not &gt;uld invite in lettersf Majesty’s •ather that ;e importa- rsian Gulf, the same ent had in y enforced nivance of led yearly etween the s based on ie duty on ice of the rely on his that their svill of the ^ a much to pay on The traffic b and the reaped a nk at the re-enforce of Persia, but they &gt; the local cover any i attitude. , told me to believe grain and xoney, but trade, and lything in cartridges grown-up lem. The obtaining have no it leaders, influence hey have, L ong their 54 5. The policy of the Persian Government in not enforcing their own prohibition has been very short-sighted. The trade routes to the interior were closed for a time in 1896 after the death of the late Shah, and may be so again at any time. Bushire and other important trade centres are also constantly, more or less, in peril, as long as a large armed population is allowed to exist close to them; and, apart from these dangers to trade, there is the possibility of grave political peril to Persian rule, which is very weak in the outlying parts of the empire, and would easily be overturned, at any rate for a time, should a general combination take place among these predatory tribes. Fortunately there are jealousies and dissensions'amona- themselves, and these enable the Persians to hold their own at present; but the time may come when they will be temporarily laid aside, and, if’ that happens, the Persians may find it difficult to regain their power. 6. While the continuation of the arms traffic affects the Persian and other States bordering the Persian Gulf in a directly vital way, there can be no doubt that its suppression is equally important to legitimate British trade, for the extension of which a firm Government and security to life and property are essential. Our trade with these parts has increased enormously of late years, and will go on increasing if the merchant can be certain that his goods will reach their destination in safety; but trade routes are delicate plants to foster, and easily destroyed, and once those into Persia are forsaken in consequence of want of suitable protection, it may be years before they can be re-opened. J 7. It appeared to me, therefore, very soon after I took over charge from Colonel Wilson in June last, that we ought to advise the Persian Govern ment to enforce their regulations, and I addressed the Legation to this effect, * No. 90, dated 4th September 1897. ^ le ^ er * note(i in the margin. Becent events have unfortunately borne out what I then wrote, as there has been much violent crime in and around Bushire itself, as well as on the routes leading to the mainland. I believe the present condition of affairs has its origin in political struggles between ocai leading men, but the extent to which the disorders have gone must undoubtedly be attributed in a great measure to the arming of the Tungus- tams, and other tribes in Persia, who are now more than a match for the ill-armed and inefficient Persian soldiers. S. The local objections to this traffic are, I think, therefore quite sufficient to jusbty the Persian Government in endeavouring to put an end to it and m justifying us m supporting their efforts as far as British firms are’con cerned. There arose, however, last year a still stronger ground for our discouraging the traffic. It was found that the tribes on the north frontier of India are armed with rifles, and there was reason to think that thev were brought by sea to the Persian Gulf, and thence carried overland to Afghanistan, and so on to the tribes with whom we have, lately been engaged m hostilities. I received secret instructions early in October from the Indian Foreign Office, informing me that information was required regarding suspected consignments of arms to Afghanistan via Persia, Bunder Abbas being mentioned as the probable port of disembarkation of cargoes. oJohf enCed + in( i uiri 1 es iQ the Gulf and at Muscat, hut on the 26th Ot tober was told that no further action was to be taken, and I, of course, in that as^r 6 ^ 11 ! ? !f° P t0 inquiries 1 bad sorted.

On the 1st December when I was at Bushire, and was on the point of starting to return to Subzabad, I was accosted by a man named Mustapha Nawab, who said he had an important communication to make to me on behalf of Haji Mahomed Mahdi who is generally known by the title of Malik- ut-Tujar, or head of the merchants. I told Mustapha Nawab to follow me to Subzabad where I would hear what he had to say. He did so, and pre sented me with a letter from the Malik-ut-Tujar to the effect that he had been appointed by the Persian Government to seize arms imported into Persia, and, as he had information of a large consignment recently brought in by a Parsee firm, Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co., which they had removed surreptitiously from the Customs House to their own warehouses, he asked permission to have the premises searched and the contraband goods secured. 11. Before taking any action on this application I called on the Malik-ut- Tujar to furnish me with his authority from the Persian Government, and directed the Vice-Consul, Mr. Gaskin, to record his statement. I also reported the matter to the Legation. Subsequently, as there was good reason to think that the arms were in the warehouses, and it was clearly shown that the Malik was duly authorised by the Persian Government to enforce their prohibition against the importation, I directed Mr. Gaskin to proceed to the office of the firm in Bushire, and call on them to produce the arms, warning them that if they failed to do so I would be obliged to issue a search warrant and to support the Persian Government in taking possession, of them. 12. The representative of the firm, a Mr. Darwar, complied, and the doors of the rooms containing the arms were sealed by the Vice-Consul. I was at first under the impression that the action of the Malik was actuated by a desire to injure the Governor of Bushire, Itemad-us-Sultan, with whom'he was at enmity, by reducing his profits from the Customs, and I did not therefore consider it advisable to assist him further when he applied for the presence of a British official during the search for arms belonging to Persian firms. 13. I was, however, instructed by telegram from the Legation to assist the Malik in every way I could, and since then the Vice-Consul, or some other representative from the Besidency, has accompanied the Malik or his official when searching for arms. The Legation further directed that all arms seized from British firms were to be made over to the Malik, after a full and complete statement, giving all particulars of all the arms and ammunition seized, had been prepared by the Vice-Consul. That a copy of this was to be sent to the Legation, and another given to the Malik, who should sign the original as warrant for its correctness. The Legation further directed that the arms were to be sent to Tehran, where those taken from Persians were also to go. The latter, in the first instance, were lodged in the Besidency, where they are still awaiting arrangements for their transport. 14. The accompanying Statements A. and B. shew the number of arms and quantity of ammunition seized (1) from British firms and (2) from Native. The details have already been sent to the Legation as directed. Statement marked (C) shews the names of firms here who are known to have been engaged in the arms trade but from whom arms have not been seized. There is strong reason to suspect that large quantities have been secreted, and it is generally suspected that the Malik-ut-Tujar only exercised his right of seizure in regard to those firms witti which he is not on friendly terms, and that he gave ample warning to others. Mr. Darwar of Eracis Times’ firm came to see me on the 9th December, and gave me to understand that his firm thought their goods were being seized in consequence of a difference they had had with the Malik, and he stated plainly that they would have easily avoided it by securing the favour of the Governor had it not been for our intervention.15. As there seems to be an impression that this Residency was actively hostile to Fracis Times or any other firm, and took steps to ensure the confiscation of their arms while allowing others to escape, I have thought it necessary to state in detail what really took place. I had heard persistently from various quarters that Messrs. Fracis Times were largely interested in the gun trade, and it was stated that they had cleared 40,000/. in a very short time by it; but I had no personal knowledge whatever of the firm prior to the seizure of their arms, and did nothing in regard to them that would not have been done in regard to other firms had a similar application been made the Persian authorities. The attitude of this Residency has been (1) disapproval of the gun trade, (2) refusal to give the advantages of our protection to British firms in regard to the importation of arms, which is illegal and opposed to the general good of the community, (3) assistance to the Persian authorities in enforcing the law as far as British firms are concerned. Wherever the fact of arms being stored in British warehouses has been brought to our notice, we have promptly given our assistance to the Persian authorities in securing them; hut it was not possible for us to say where arms were, or were not; and as the proposal for the confiscation of Fracis Times’ arms emanated from the Malik-ut-Tujar, so, at any rate at first, it lay with him to say where others were to be found. The Residency here has no police force, or means of getting secret information, there not being any secret fund at our disposal. We were therefore, in this particular matter, in the hands of the Persian authorities, and were obliged to accept whatever information regarding arms being concealed that they chose to give. Later od, Mr. Hardinge, hearing that arms were concealed, kindly placed 100/. (from the Secret Service Fund of the Legation) at our disposal, and we are now endeavouring to obtain reliable information on the subject. Until, however, we received this offer of assistance, we were dependent on the local Persian authorities, and it is extremely doubtful if, at this late stage of the proceedings, we shall now be able to discover where arms, not originally seized, have been concealed. 16. I left Bushire on the 14th December, and the measures subsequently taken at that place were under the immediate supervision of Lieutenant Prideaux, First Assistant Resident, who acted in direct communication with the Legation, copies of the telegrams being sent to me. A report by Lieutenant Prideaux accompanies. 17. While I was away from Bushire, I received information that the British and Persian Governments had entered into an agreement for the seizure of arms bound for Persian ports, in British or Persian vessels, and I was instructed to invite the Sultan of Muscat to join the other Governments, by allowing the seizure of arms, bound for Persian or Indian ports, in Muscat waters, and of Muscat vessels taking arms to those two countries in Persian or Indian waters. He was also to be invited to warn his subjects against exporting arms to Persian or Indian Ports. I visited Muscat on the 1st January 1898, and, after some negotiations with the Sultan, I induced him to agree to the wishes of the two other Governments, and he entered into the agreement proposed. The result was the capture of the cargo of arms in the S.S. “ Baluchistan ” which was taken by H.M.S. “ Lapwing” on the 24th January near Muscat. The arms then seized have been made over to the British Consul, Major Fagan, who has been instructed as to their disposal, and his proceedings will form the subject of a separate report.^ No prohibition to the import could be asked for from the Sultan, as it was considered that it would be opposed to treaty obligations entered into by Muscat rulers with France and Great Britain, and we could only deal tnere- fore with the export from Muscat to Persia or India, and with the seizure of arms for those two countries in Muscat waters. Arms bound for Muscat itself cannot, under present conditions, be touched. 18. The three depots for arms in the Persian Gulf are Bushire, Muscat, and Bahrain. I have already described what has been done at the two first- named places, and must now turn to Bahrain. The Shaikh of that place is, to a great extent, under our protection, and we have a British agent, one Mohamed Rahim, to look after our interests there. S. 13. CTwo years ago the Shaikh published a notification forbidding the impor tation of arms into Bahrain. I attach a translation of this document, which, as will he seen, is somewhat ambiguous, for while the Shaikh on the one hand absolutely forbids the introduction of arms, he, on the other, fixed a fine for bringing them. This may be regarded as a heavy duty, and I understand that in any case it was only to apply to arms brought in' for use in the islands, and that the prohibition was not intended to prevent the use of the place as a depot to keep arms in, till it was convenient to re-ship them. Anyhow the Shaikh gave a concession to his Yazir, one Abdul Bahman, to import arms on the condition that he was to give him yearly 30 rifles and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. This was made over by the Vazir to our Agent, who in turn gave it to Messrs. Eracis Times. I have not quite clearly made out what Mohamed Rahim gave the Vazir, but Fracis Times were to give the Agent 10 per cent, on value of arms imported. 19. By these arrangements, a brisk trade in arms was set on foot. Arms were taken to Bahrain when it was not convenient to leave them at Muscat, or bring them on to Bushire, and, later on, were shipped in native crafts to the shores of the gulf. I believe they went chiefly to the Arab coast, but there is reason to believe that a certain amount were also taken to Persia. I was not, at first, aware that our Agent was so much interested in the trade, and as soon as it came to my notice I called on him for an explanation. This is not altogether satisfactory but need not be further referred to here, as it forms the subject of a separate inquiry. It is, however, necessary to state that the relations between Mohamed Rahim and Fracis Times, which were at first intimate, became strained later on, owing, I believe, to difference of opinion as to division of the profits, and in December the Agent appears to have endeavoured to get back the Shaikh’s concession. This Fracis refused to return, and, in January, the Shaikh, acting, I believe, on the Mohamed Rahim’s instigation, placed an embargo on the firm’s ware houses at Bahrain, which he locked up. This action of the Shaikh’s was without reference to the Residency. Messrs. Fracis Times have protested, and the question is still under consideration. I arrived at Bahrain on the 4th February and remained till the 8th. During that time I arranged with the Shaikh for similar agreements to those into which the Sultan of Muscat had entered. 20. I visited the warehouses of Fracis Times, but could not, during my stay, make a complete inventory of the arms in them. A subsequent examination made by the Shaikh, our Agent, and Mr. Fracis, shows that there are 2,667 rifles, and 6,37,500 rounds of ammunition. I advised the Shaikh to be careful to have an exact list prepared and verified by Mr. Fracis, and it may therefore be assumed that the statement I have received is correct. 21. The result of these operations against the arms traffic gives the following figures :— Eifles. Ammunitiou. At Bushire - 5,210 11.19,274 At Muscat, from Baluchistan . - 7,856 7,00,000 At Bahrain - - - 2,667 6,37,500 Total - - 15,733 24,56,774 22. These figures speak for themselves, and show what a demand thfcre has been of late for arms in these countries. It must also be remembered that they do not by any means represent the total number which were to have been sold during the present year, for we have not been able to touch the arms already in Muscat, or those consigned to that place, nor have we, I am certain, seized all the arms which were at Bushire when the work was commenced in December.23. I will not here enter into the various legal questions which the course now taken is certain to open up, and it does not seem desirable either to discuss the eventual disposal of the arms, hut it is my duty to point out that, since we have done our utmost to prevent our own merchants from engaging in an illegal and dangerous traffic, we may now fairly insist that it is 'also made prohibitive for all other nations. Otherwise we shall have injured our own trade to no purpose, and other than British vessels will bring the weapons which the tribesmen so much desire. The profits are so great that people will be found to run the risks the traffic entails, unless we see that the Persians really continue to enforce their regulations against it. 24. Since preparing the above report, I have received telegram No. 77, from the Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, and have sent a reply telegram No. 91, dated 22nd March. Copies of these communications are attached to this report, and I think that, in view of the protest of Messrs. Fracis Times &amp; Co., I ought to go more fully than I originally intended into the grounds on which that firm and others will probably dispute the legality of the seizures made, and the arguments there are in favour of the proceedings which have taken place. 25. First. As regards the action of the Persian Government, I think there is no doubt that the late Shah was strongly opposed to the traffic, and that his prohibition was well known to every one. In the East, however, and especially in Persia, such prohibitions are regarded by venal officials, merely as a convenient means for adding to their own profits. The Government of the Gulf Ports is farmed out yearly, and the individual who purchases the contract tries to make all he can out of the Customs duties, which are his chief source of revenue. The fact that the importation of arms and am munition was forbidden, enabled successive Governors to demand a higher duty from the importers of these articles than they were legally empowered to claim for British goods, and the fact, which I have no doubt can he clearly established, that the latter paid these high duties without protest or reference to the British authorities, is itself a proof that they knew well they were engaged in an illegal traffic which would not be upheld. The evasion of their own regulations was, as I have already noticed in this report, probably well known to the Government at Tehran, who must have been aware why the farming of the Customs of the Gulf Ports had become so much more valuable. I doubt, however, if this could be established, and I do not think that the misconduct of the local officials in allowing the law to he evaded can be effectively urged against the Persian Government itself, when the right of that Government to take measures to enforce its own regulations comes to be enquired into. 26. Second. The next point for consideration is the statement that the British authorities gave no warning to importers of arms and ammunition. The reply to this is that the original prohibition was duly circulated, and was never withdrawn. It was universally known that it existed, and the British Consulate has declined, on more than one occasion, to interfere on behalf of British firms/ where arms were involved. The great increase in the traffic has taken place during the last few years, and Colonel Wilson, my immediate predecessor, was well aware of it, but did not see his way to take any action in regard to British firms as long as the Persian Government neglected to enforce their own regulations equally against all nationalities. Colonel WTlson apparently considered that any action on our part, without the active co-operation of the Persian authorities, might injure British trade, without stopping the traffic in arms. He was, however, equally with myself, entirely opposed to the traffic, the danger of which he recognised, and none of the importers can possibly assert that they were countenanced or encouraged to persevere in it.

The purport of this paper is that I, Essa bin Ali A1 Khalifa, hereby say that I have given permission and authority to Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Wahab for the importation of guns into Bahrain, and the sale of the same should be in his hands. Nobody has got permission to import guns into Bahrain at all. If anybody were to do so, he will be punished. He should give me on account of this arrangement every year, 30 guns, Martini-Henry, with 200 cartridges for each, and he should also give for duty 3 guns out of every 100 with 200 cartridges each, and he should not sell the guns to the inhabitants of Bahrain and Kater, and the Arab coast, but to (the inhabitants) of Oman coast, he has permission to sell. If anyone has got a gun (personal property) and wishes to sell it, he can do so. And this arrange ment is to last during his lifetime. It has been agreed that this arrangement cannot be broken so long as he thinks advisable to carry it on. Seal of Shaikh Essa bin Ali A1 Khalifah. Whatever is written on this paper on account of this concession, I endorse it to Aga Mohamed Rahim bin Abdul Nabby Saffer, and he has (my) full sanction.

Memorandum on Confiscation of Arms at Bushire during absence of the Resident, prepared by Lieutenant Rrideaux, Eirst Assistant Resident. Colonel Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, left Bushire on the 14th December 1897, leaving me to carry on the local current duties of the Residency and Consulate-General during his absence on tour. 2. Prior to his departure, and on the formal request of the Malek-ut- Tujar, the premises of, first Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co. on the 7th December, and then Mr. Zeytoon, Agent for Messrs. H. C. Dixon &amp; Co., and Messrs. Livingstone Muir &amp; Co. on the 11th, had been visited and searched by Mr. Vice-Consul Gaskin (under orders from Colonel Meade) and by one Mustafa Nawab, on behalf of the Malek-ut-Tujar. 3. The arms and ammunition found in the possession of Messrs. Eracis Times &amp; Co. and Messrs. Livingstone Muir &amp; Co. were placed in godowns under the joint seals of Mr. Gaskin and Mustafa Nawab, but no seals were placed on the arms in Mr. Zeytoon’s office, as the latter declared that none of the arms there were the property nor under the lien of any British firm. Mr. Gaskin reported that he warned Mr. Zeytoon that if the Persian authorities again visited his house and seized the arms found in it, he would then have no right to complain to or ask for protection from the British Residency. 4. Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm’s premises were also called at on the same day, but were not entered as both partners of the firm were absent. 5. On the 12th December Messrs. Malcolm’s premises were again visited, but on certain permits from various Persian Ministers, for the import of a specified number of arms being produced by the Messrs. Malcolm, Mustafa Nawab informed Mr Gaskin that he would defer searching the house that day, and would refer the matter to the Malek-ut-Tujar for orders. S. 13. D6. On the 13th December Mr. Gaskin and Mustafa Nawab visited the Weapons. Cartridges. vSyeds M. H. and M. I. Shabankara - 631 162,092 Haji N.

Between the 14th and 23rd December 1897, the arms and ammunition belonging to Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co., and Messrs. Livingstone Muir &amp; Co., which had previously been sealed up, were counted and handed over to the Malek-ut-Tujar, as were also a small number found in Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm’s house on the 23rd December. The Custom House, to the searching of which the Governor Itemad-us-Sultan had at first objected, was overhauled on the 21st, 22nd and 23rd December, and cases belonging to Pracis Times &amp; Co., A. and T. J. Malcolm, and Aratoon Malcolm, were seized in it, besides others which had been imported for Persian merchants by Carling &amp; Co. and Pracis Times &amp; Co. 8. On the 19th December I received instructions from Her Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran to the effect that arms owned by British subjects were all to he delivered to the Malek-ut-Tujar, whilst those belonging to Persian subjects were to be kept for safe custody in the British Residency, until the Malek-ut-Tujar was ready to despatch them to Tehran. These orders were successfully carried out during the next few days without any difficulties, the Governor, who it had been expected would raise some, contenting himself with merely telegraphing to Tehran and trying to get fhe Malek-ut-Tujar’s post transferred to himself. 9. The premises of the Persian Gulf Trading Company and Messrs. J. C. P. Hotz and Son were visited on the 22nd December. In the first- mentioned none were found, whilst Messrs. Hotz* Agent was able to produce a permit from the Sadr Azam for the 80 shot guns and ammunition, which alone were found in their office. These the Malek-ut-Tujar did not confiscate. 10. On the 25th December 1897 the S.S. “ Tresco ” arrived in Bushire. She was at once hoarded by Mr. Vice-Consul Gaskin and Mustafa Nawab, who learned that she had discharged 154 cases of arms and ammunition at Muscat. They succeeded, however, in finding two cases of rifles, eight cases of percussion caps, and one case containing loading implements and game hags, all of which, except one of the cases of rifles which, being owned by a Persian, was brought into the Residency, are in the custody of the Malek-ut-Tujar. 11. On the 27th December 1897 the Malek-ut-Tujar despatched an official to Muhammerah to seize arms, and on the 1st January 1898 two others to Lingah. None of these, however, have met with any success except the first named, who seized two rifles on hoard a huggalow and brought them down to Bushire, although their owner stated that he kept them only to defend himself against the pirates who frequent the Shat- el-Arab. 12. On the 7th January 1898 the Malek-ut-Tujar seized two Snider rifles and some ammunition on board a buggalow at Bushire. These were also said by their owner to be for the defence of his vessel. 13. On the 22nd January 1898 the Governor of Bushire, Itemad-us- Sultan, sent me information that he suspected that a warehouse belonging to a Persian named Mir Ahmed Devani contained some rifles concealed in it. Mr. Gaskin and the Malek-ut-Tujar proceeded to the spot, accompanied by a representative of the Governor’s, and 49 rifles were discovered buried under a quantity of bhoosa (chopped hay). The Governor took much credit to himself for effecting this seizure.37 62 14. On the 1st February 1898 the S.S. “ Baluchistan ” arrived at Bushire. She was at once boarded by Mr. Vice-Consul Gaskin and the representatives of the Malek-ut-Tujar and the Governor. Three cases of arms were found on board. The first two, containing 59 rifles and 200 revolver cartridges respectively, were deposited in the Residency, as they belonged to Persians, whilst the third case, owned by a Dutch subject, Mr. Lamberts of Tehran, was taken over by the Malek-ut-Tujar. 15. On the 7th February 1898 the Maiek-ut-Tujar gave information that a number of cartridges had been found in a caravanserai belonging to a Persian. The place was therefore searched by his representative, accompanied by an official from the Residency, and 3 rifles and 1,265 cartridges in all were found. These also were taken into the Residency. 16. Colonel Meade returned to Bushire on the 9th February 1898, since when only one seizure on the 21st February of 24 rifles and 15,994 cartridges belonging to Persian subjects has been effected by the Malek- ut-Tujar.

Following received from Lord Salisbury:—Messrs. Fracis Times and Company, one of the firms whose rifles have been seized, have addressed us letter of protest in which, amongst other arguments, they state they established at Bushire in 1887 an agency, and that since that time they have constantly shipped to that port arms and ammunition, which have been so described in Custom House returns and ships’ manifests, have been examined by Persian Custom House authorities, and paid customs duties. They state further that all this was well known to British Consul-General and that they never had any intimation that there was any prohibition to the importation of arms and ammunition into Bushire, that no notice to that effect is to be found in front of the Custom House or elsewhere, nor had they any reason to suppose that prohibition promulgated by former Shah was in force. Please obtain and telegraph observations of Her Majesty’s Consul-General on these statements. We have already replied that as to our knowledge a consignment of arms was seized at Bushire two years ago, we cannot admit that the prohibition was unknown, but it would be useful to be able to traverse their statements more completely. Letter will be sent to you and to India for detailed reply. Message ends. Please telegraph as concisely as possible your observations and every argument of which there should be many. Sub-Enclosure 7. Telegram from Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire, dated 22nd March 1898, to Her Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. No. 91. Your telegram No. 77. I would observe in reply that archives of my office show Persian Government prohibited arms traffic in 1881 and that Shall in 1891 reiterated order, stating emphatically that prohibition must be enforced. In 1895 Persian authorities seized a large consignment of arms on the ground that their coming to Bushire was illegal, and in 1896 the Persian Government appointed a special preventive officer. Notice of prohibition was duly promulgated and circulated to British firms, and there is no doubt that it was well known traffic was illegal, and that the better class of British firms in consequence took no part in it. Firms who did engage in traffic knew also it was forbidden, and it is reported they used tosmuggle arms. Among others Fracis Times is said to have done this. Latterly the traffic has been moi'e open, due, I am told, to the importers having, as they thought, purchased immunity by paying higher duties than on other goods and by bribing local officials. Mr. Darwar of Fracis Times’ firm admitted this when he visited me on 9th December as reported in telegram No. 263, and further evidence will, I think, be easily obtainable. My predecessor was undoubtedly aware of increase in importation arms but took no steps against British firms, as it was anticipated doing so would injure British trade without really checking importation, unless Persian Govern ment enforced prohibition equally against all nationalities. No intimation of contemplated action of Persian Government was given. I was myself unaware of it till asked by Persian official to co-operate with him. I have prepared full report, which may I think he awaited; but in meantime I wish to urge that, as the reckless distribution of arms which has gone on of late in countries bordering Persian Gulf has rendered settled Government difficult, and is perilous to legitimate British trade, the traffic should be discountenanced in every possible way.

With reference to my letter of the 17th ultimo, relating to the seizure of arms in the Persian Gulf, and to the request made personally by a member of your firm for precise information as to the orders issued by the Persian Government in 1881, to prohibit the importation of arms, I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit to you a copy of a letter addressed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the 3rd July of that year, notifying the issue of the orders in question. I am, &amp;c., Messrs. Waltons, Johnson, Bubb, T. H. Sandeeson. and What ton. Enclosure in No. 4. Persian Minister to Her Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Translation.) Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Sir, 3rd July 1881. Since the right of purchasing arms and munitions of war abroad and introducing the same into Persia belongs to the Persian Government, who exercise it through their own specially appointed officials, and if this absolute right were not exclusively confined to the Government, and everybody who thought fit to do so were allowed to purchase such articles and introduce them into the country, this great governmental privilege would become obsolete and considerable evils would result to the State. Therefore His Majesty the Shah has issued orders that no one shall import arms of any description whatsoever into this country from abroad, and any person in whose possession arms of foreign make are found will be liable to have them .confiscated by Government. By His Majesty’s orders the above is communicated to your Excellency in order that you may bring it to the knowledge of British merchants and subjects, so that being informed of it they may be careful to avoid trading in these prohibited goods, and so that no injury may result to them from ignorance of the present regulations.

Mathews &amp; Co. to Foreign Office. 29, Waterloo Street, Birmingham, g- r 22nd .April 3 898. Importation of Arms to the Persian Gulf. We had hoped to have received from you ere now an intimation that Political the prohibition of the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia had No * 1957 /9»- been withdrawn. , With regard to the statement m your letter* of the 24th March that it has been in violation of the * Political No. 863/98, (not printed.) regulations and was an illegal traffic, we point out that there has never been any actual prohibition at any time, and that in your own official reports which are annually put before both Houses of Parliament, the prohibition is distinctly described as theoretical and nominal, and used for the purpose of increasing the revenues, and the knowledge and sanction of the Persian Government of this trade has always been known to the British Government officials as proved by the annual repots.fu^er p 0 j nt out t | iat t ] ie present Besident, Colonel Meade, in commenting upon the appointment of a special officer to watch the traffic, stated “ as, however, the official in question paid for his post in the usual « f as hion, it is certain that neither he or his Government had any real “ intention that his order should be carried out.” You would appear to be in error in stating that a consignment of arms was seized by the Persian authorities at Bushire in 1892. We are unaware of am such seizure. We know that in 1895 a shipment was landed in Bushire owing to the steamer’s inability to land at Muscat, for which port it was intended ; but these goods were not seized on account of prohibition as you surest but were only detained by the Customs officials because the consignees refused to pay duty before re-shipping them to Muscat. We do not doubt that the Persian Government has a right to put a stop to this trade, but they have no right to seize goods after having been imported at their invitation and removed from the Customs after duty has been paid UI&gt; It very probable that some of the articles imported are of Belgian manufacture, and it would appear that Belgian manufacturers have suffered as well as our clients, but the fact remains that the honest trade carried on for nearly 20 years by many Birmingham gun manufacturers is now threatened with extinction, at the instance of the loieign Office. We call your attention to the fact that one large firm in London, Messrs.

You add, however, that they have “ no right to seize goods “ after having been imported at their invitation and removed from the “ Customs after duty has been paid upon them.” Lord Salisbury has no information which justifies the conclusion that the Persian Government have lately seized arms imported under a permit signed by competent authority, and admitted on payment of duty to that Government. If in any instance your clients can prove that such has been the case, and fail to obtain satisfaction from the Persian authorities, I am to suggest that a representation on the subject, supported by the requisite proofs, should be made to the Resident at Bushire, to whom a copy of the correspondence will be sent.

In further reference to your Lordship’s letter* of the 5th March, we left at the Eoreign Office yesterday certain proofs that the three cases by the “ Arabistan,” which were intended for Muscat, were overcarried to Bushire purely and simply by an error. Among the papers above referred to, we beg to call your Lordship’s attention to the certified specification of the shipment furnished by the Customs authorities in Manchester, wherein it will be found that the ultimate destination of the goods at the time of shipment was Muscat. It will further be seen by the carbon copies of the ship’s manifest that the three cases were destined for Muscat, and that the goods do not appear on the manifest referring to the Bushire cargo, or the option manifest. It will also be found that the bill of lading distinctly states that the destination of the goods was Muscat, and the freight note to which we take the liberty of calling your Lordship’s special attention also gives the destination of the goods as Muscat. It will also be seen by your Lordship, from the copies of other freight notes we left at the Eoreign Office, that the freight to Bushire by our steamers on arms and ammunition was and is 100s. per ton, whereas the freight paid us by the shippers on the three cases in question was 140s. per ton, that being then the freight ruling for Muscat, and we submit to your Lordship that the shippers would not have paid to us freight at the rate of 140s. per ton had the destination of the goods been Bushire, the freight for the latter port being, as your Lordship will perceive, 40s. per ton less than that for Muscat. We also beg to hand you enclosed a copy of the shippers’ outward invoice, also showing the destination Muscat. Beferring to the points raised in your Lordship’s letter of the 5th March, as to the bills of lading being made out to “ order,” and the goods generalised as merchandise, we beg to remind your Lordship that it is customary for bills of lading to be made to “ order,” and endorsed in blank by the shippers, also for goods to be generalised as merchandise in the body of the bill of lading. The contents of the cases in question were duly passed in the specification furnished to the Custom House at the port of loading, and also set out in the manifest. In support of the custom of bills of lading being made out to “ order,” we have furnished your Lordship with letters from several bankers in London testifying that such is the practice, and in con firmation of the custom of generalising the goods as merchandise in the body of the bill of lading, we have also left at the Eoreign Office letters from two or three of the most important lines of steamers who confirm this usage, together with certain bills of lading, whereon it will be found that these lines of steamers print “ packages of merchandise ” in the body of the bill of lading. We trust these various proofs enumerated in this letter will sufficiently confirm to your Lordship that the goods were intended for Muscat, that they were overcarried by mistake, and that no irregularity of any description occurred in the matter at issue, and that our application to your Lordship for the release of the three cases in question will meet with your Lordship’s favourable consideration, and enable us to deliver the cases at their real destination, namely, Muscat.

Foreign Office to Messrs. F. C. Strict &amp; Co. Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 12 th May 1898. I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, on the subject of the three cases of arms shipped on board the steamship “ Arabistan,” which are stated to have been destined for Muscat, and to have been overcarried by error to Bushire. I am to inform you that the papers left by you at this Office, which are returned herewith, are not sufficient to convince Lord Salisbury that the arms seized on Persian soil were not sent to the Persian Gulf for importation into Persia where they were found.. I am therefore to suggest that the consignees for whom the arms were intended should present themselves before the Political Officers in the Persian Gulf, and explain with the necessary proofs the destination of the arms and the purposes for which they were ordered. I am, &amp;c., Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Company. No. 11. (Memorandum by the Political Secretary.) Persian Prohibitions .—On the 3rd of July 1881, the Persian Government Political notified to the British and other Foreign Governments that the trade in arms No. 2024/98. and ammunition with Persian ports was prohibited. “ Importers,” writes Colonel Meade on 22nd March 1898, “ were well aware of this.” The British ^Minister observed that we had at times applied to the Persian authorities to prevent Afghanistan obtaining munitions of war through Persia, and therefore he had raised no objection to the prohibition. Never theless, owing to the weakness of the central authority, and to the sale of the offices of Governor and Customs Collector, the traffic continued, and importers made secret arrangements with the local officials to evade the law. * And in 1893, see No. 12 , and India In 1895* the Persian authorities seized letter No. lie ol 4th August 1897. a large consignment of arms in Bushire, and in the following year a special preventive officer was appointed by the Persian Government to enforce the prohibition against the traffic. On the other hand certain British traders, who had landed in 1895 at Bushire some arms from the S.S. “ Zulu,” alleged to have been over-carried by mistake, appealed to the British Government against their confiscation by the Persians, and obtained the restitution of their goods. The Consular reports also, year by year, noticed the increasing trade in arms with Persia in terms which, if they referred to the prohibition, seemed to treat it as nominal only. In 1897, however, events occurred which brought to the front the danger to Persia and the Government of India arising from the neglect to enforce the law, and on the 1st of December 1897, the British [Resident at Bushire was informed that the Persian Government had already authorised the Malik-ut-Tajir to seize any arms he could find at Bushire which had been illicitly imported. On the 18th December 1897 the Sadr Azam addressed the British Legation referring to the prohibitive laws and expressing satisfaction at the prospect of concerted action. The Persian Government announced its determination to enforce the law rigidly, and caused a communication to be made to the Sultan of Muscat inviting his co-operation. It also accepted an offer of the British Government to assist it by searching British vessels believed to be engaged in the illicit traffic, and by seizing any arms or ammunition found on them in Persian waters which might be on their way to Persian ports, and be owned by British or Persian subjects. The Sultan of Muscat readily promised his aid, and extended the prohibition against71 importation into Persia or British India to Muscat territory and its waters ; and on the 13th of January 1898 His Highness issued a notification declaring that arms or ammunition destined for Persia or British India and found in Muscat waters would be confiscated. At various dates in December the premises of certain merchants in Bushire were visited by Persian officers in the presence of British consular officers, and stores of arms, &amp;c., were seized. The steamship “ Tresco ” arrived at Bushire on the 25th of December 1897, and a few arms were also seized on board her, and the same operation was repeated on the arrival of the “ Baluchistan ” in that port on the 1st of February 1898. Previously to this the “ Baluchistan ” had been stopped on January 24th in Muscat waters by H.M.S. “ Lapwing, 5 ’ which acted under the proclamation of the 13th of January 1898, and on the 15th of April 1898, a Court appointed by the Sultan found that the arms and ammunition seized on board were intended for Persian ports, although the marks on the cases had been fraudulently altered at Port Said on or about the 6th of January 1898, and it decreed that they were therefore justly confiscated. The owners of the S.S. “ Baluchistan 55 must have expected the fate which they provoked. They also owned the S.S. “ Turkistan 55 which had carried in February and in July of 1897 a quantity of arms to the Gulf, and the S.S. “ Arabistan 55 which had sailed in September 1897 with several cases of arms and ammunition. It is inconceivable that they were not aware of the restrictions and dangers of the trade. In fact on the 23rd of December, four days before the “ Baluchistan ” sailed from Marseilles, and long before it reached Port Said, or Jibuti, they wrote to the Foreign Office referring to the orders given by the Persian Government, and asking Lord Salisbury “ to give such instructions as will enable our steamer to have protection in this matter.” They admitted that the Itesident had informed their agent that “ the arms are liable to be seized and confiscated in Persian waters.’ 5 On the 24th of December they were asked by the Foreign Office to give -certain detailed information as to the consignee’s names and other particulars. This, however, was an inconvenient request with which they did not comply, and on 13th of January their omission was referred to in these terms: “ In the absence of that information there is nothing to show that the “ shippers and exporters were not, at the time of exportation, alive to the “ risks which they have incurred by engaging in a trade which is contrary to “ Persian law and regulations. 55 British Interests .—It is convenient here to summarise some of the reasons which induced the British Government to come to an agreement with the Persian Government, and to assist it in enforcing the Persian regulations : I. For some years past it had been evident that Muscat w^as becoming a centre of trade ^ in arms and ammunition, and the Sultan was anxious to stop its growth as dangerous to his own position. Re bellions against his authority in Dhofar and at Mattra had proved that the tribesmen were armed, and the British Government had given advice and even lent its active aid in restoring the Sultan’s authority. It was at first proposed to put a heavy tax on the importation of arms, but the Muscat Treaties of Commerce, of 21st September 1833, with the United States, of 19th March 1891, with Great Britain, of 17 th November 1844, with France, and the rights of other most favoured nations were found to be opposed to this solution. The alternative of prohibiting the export of arms to the Gulf from Great Britain was considered and rejected. There seemed then no other course open save that of stopping the trade with Persia and India through Muscat, and this course, after a discussion of some months, was finally proposed to the Foreign Office on 1st December 1897, the very day on which the agent of the Persian Government informed the Resident at Bushire of the orders which he had in dependently received from the Persian authorities to make a seizure of arms. II. Amongst other events which served to call attention to British interests in the matter were several piratical attacks on British Indian vessels trading with the Gulf and the Shatt-el-Arab. In the case of the Hari Prasad, and more recently in that of the Kalian Pasa which72 was attacked on the 2nd of December 1897 near Saihan Point, the fatal use of firearms and our failure to secure satisfaction for the piracies convinced Government that steps must be taken to protect British commerce by dealing with this question. There were precedents for such action, because in 1892 the Sultan of Muscat had, in the interests of Germany, been induced to prohibit the re-exportation of arms from Muscat for the coasts of Africa, and in the previous year their exportation to Gwadar was also forbidden. Now, British interests in the Gulf are hound up with peace, because we have a network of Indian treaties with the tribes for what is called “ the Maritime Truce.” Of recent years, at Koweit and Bahrein, and at Zobara in the El Katr peninsula, there have been grave disturbances requiring our intervention, and in each case the position was aggravated by the arms traffic. III. In Persia itself British interests had suffered from attacks upon the telegraph system of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which the Persian Government and the local chiefs are bound to protect under agreements with the Government of India. Several lawless incidents culminated in the murder of Mr. Graves in December 1897, and the increase of these attacks was attributed to the arming of the robbers and tribes in southern Persia. Even at Bushire itself the Besidency was not free from danger, while the roads into the interior were often unsafe. IV. Beyond the borders of Persia and in Baluchistan itself a survey party was attacked on the 9th January 1898, and it became necessary to land a force of sailors and British Indian troops in order to protect the servants of the Indian Government. V. It was also ascertained that arms were being imported into Afghanistan through Bandar Ahhas, Charbar, and other ports opposite Muscat, and it was alleged and feared that the tribes in revolt on the Indian frontier were obtaining ammunition and arms from the Persian Gulf. In support of this last assertion it was proved that Afghan emissaries were awaiting the arrival of the “ Baluchistan ” at Muscat, and 20 packets of Martini-Henry ammunition, with paper showing that it was made in Belgium, were found at Pasni in Mir Suka’s house in Eebruary last. It is worthy of note that the Belgian manufacturers of rifles obtained last year from the British Government contractors the exact measurements of the British Martini-Henry rifle, so as to ensure that the British ammunition would fit the rifles; obviously those who ordered the rifles expected to get access to British car tridges. Certain caravans have also lately started for the British Indian frontier from the Baluchistan coast with cases supposed to contain arms transported from Muscat, and steps have been taken to follow them up. The only doubt which has been thrown on the supply of these rifles and ammunition to the tribes arises from the fact that amongst the arms surrendered by the tribes none corre sponded to the arms known to have been sent to Muscat. But the value of this evidence is discounted by the fact that the tribes have surrendered only their worthless, stolen, or specially made-up arms, and no rifles have been captured in the field, because rifles as well as the bodies of the slain are removed by the tribesmen. Information obtained in England shows that the importers in the Gulf ordered arms on account of the tribes, and it is noteworthy that the Belgian manufacturers took pains, after the outbreak of the disturbances in 1897, to erase all marks on the rifles and cartridge cases sent out by them for the Gulf. Methods of the Trade .—The methods of the trade lend weight to the suspicion that the arms were known to be liable to seizure and were wanted for no proper purpose. Secrecy has been the rule in the last two years. Arms have been shipped or transhipped at the last moment in order to take advantage of confusion or hurry. In some cases the intention to ship at London has been altered in view of the vigilance of the Customs, and the cases have been shipped at Manchester instead. Although the exporters S. 13. Ghave in many instances received full payment before shipment, the hills of lading have even in those cases shown no names of consignees. Clearly in such cases the names were omitted by design, as the Bills did not pass through a Bank, and there was no need to adopt the vague generality “ to order.” In a recent case a false name of consignee, namely, Gopalji Walji, was entered as the consignee, and repudiated by the said Gopalji on arrival. Even the name of the exporter has been changed at the last moment in order to divert attention, as where Spencer was put in place of Carling &amp; Co. The arms have been entered on bills of lading as “ hard ware,” and when on one occasion a true copy of the bill of lading was called for, the shippers inserted “ merchandise ” for “ hardware ” which would have been a less inaccurate description, and when the bill was challenged they wrote that it was made out “ from memory.” The cases themselves bear marks only and no address. Even these marks and the destination are altered on board, either at Port Said or at sea. The shippers undertake to land not merely at the port originally named, but at another port in the Gulf as desired, and the desire of the consignee is signified at the last moment, and even at a port on the way to the Gulf. The practice of the trade has been carefully watched of late, and the main impression pro duced by the inquiries is the endeavour to obscure the destination and the names of the recipients of the arms. Some firms of repute have given up the trade, and the firms which take most part in it have Indians or Persians as partners. At the port of receipt the trade is largely in the hands of those, e.g., Malcolm &amp; Co. of Bushire, or Gopalji Walji of Muscat, who have secured a contract for the collection of the customs. Where the importer is not also collector, he secures the goodwill of the customs authorities by payment of a bribe in the shape of a special ad valorem duty. The receipts from these duties are not entered as customs receipts. The English firms have agents at Muscat or in the Gulf, whose proceedings are in accord with the whole spirit of secrecy that pervades the trade. Einally, the arms sent out are chiefly of Belgian make, and the greatest care has of late been taken to remove all marks from them. Our policy for the future .—I have shown that despite the representations of Muscat, and the customs regulations of Persia, an illicit traffic in arms, chiefly of Belgian make, has been carried on by a few British firms in a secret manner with the Gulf, and that it is inimical to British interests. As to its extent, its registered value rose from Its. 13,120 in 1892-93 to Pts. 23,87,195 in 1896-97, and when lately the operations of search and seizure were conducted at Bushire, Muscat, and Bahrein some two-and-a- half million rounds of ammunition, and nearly 16,000 rifles were seized. Our interests in the Gulf are to preserve peace and order for commerce, and in Persian territory we desire to maintain communications and open out trade routes. In Baluchistan we are more directly responsible for order, and it is important that Afghan and Pathan tribes should not have access to an unlimited supply of arms. Even on the Arab coast we have of late years actively interfered to uphold the Sultan’s rule, and that rule is imperilled by the importation of arms. We must therefore continue to assist our allies in suppressing the illicit traffic in arms, and it is necessary that no favour should be shown by them to foreign merchants. We have a right to expect that Persia will uniformly exert itself to confiscate arms imported by any nation contrary to its regulations. As regards the British importers, whose arms have been seized, no intervention on their behalf will be justified unless they can prove in the Consular Courts that the arms seized were not intended for Persian or British territory, or if so intended were being sent under permission duly received from responsible authority. The trade is at present almost entirely suspended, and its revival would be unfair upon Persia and Muscat as well as opposed to our own interests. W^.

A number of actions are pending against them by the shippers of the arms in question, and the attempt is being made to save the parties the expense and delay of taking evidence in Persia on Commission. A summons dealing with this matter was before Mr. Justice Kennedy in the Commercial Court on Friday, 27th May, and that learned Judge directed us to communicate with you on the following points. You were good enough on 13th May to write a letter, a copy of which is sent herewith, to Messrs. Walton, Johnson, Bubb, and Whatton who act for other underwriters. It is hoped that, if further particulars of some of the statements contained in that letter can be given, the parties may he saved much expense. For instance, can you give the Judge any further information as to the date of the Order of 1891 mentioned in your letter, and have you the text of the Order or of its communication to the British Minister or Consuls ? Can you give any further particulars as to the date and place of the seizure of arms in 1895, with the name of the consignee, or as to the appointment of the Special Preventive Officer in 1896 ? Have you in your possession in England the Persian text of the notification of 1881? If this information is not in your possession in England, would it he possible to obtain it from Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire by telegram with the sanction of your Office ? The Judge has adjourned the application before him until 11th June to allow this communication being made to you, and we shall be much obliged if you can give us the information desired in time to lay it before his Lordship.

In reply to your letter of the 6th instant, relating to the case of the steamer “ Baluchistan,” I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to inform you that the text of the Order of the Persian Goverment prohibiting the importation of arms, which was issued in 1881, is not in the possession of this Department. The note from the Persian Government to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, announcing the issue of the Order, has been already communicated to you in the letter from this Office of the 21st ultimo. With regard to the further enquiries in your letter, I am to state that Her Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire reported that the archives of his Office show that the traffic in arms was prohibited by the Persian Government in 1881 and that the Order was reiterated by the Shah in 1891, when it was stated emphatically that the prohibition of the trade must be enforced. A large consignment of arms was seized by the Persian Authorities in 1895, on the ground that their coming to Bushire was illegal, and in 1896 a Special Political No. 2040/98.75 Preventive Officer was appointed by the Persian Government. The Consul- General also states that notice of the original prohibition was duly promulgated and circulated to British firms, and that there is no doubt that the traffic was well known to be illegal, and that the majority of the British firms of high standing took no part in it in consequence. The original prohibition was never withdrawn, as it was universally known that it existed. The British Consulate has declined on more than one occasion to interfere on behalf of British firms, where arms were involved. We shall be glad if you would kindly inform us whether you have a copy of the Notice which was circulated by the Consul-General, and whether a copy of it was sent to Messrs. Pracis, Times, &amp; Co. In reply to your letters of the 4th and 7th instant, I am directed by the Marquess of Salisbury to transmit to you a textual translation of the order which was issued on 1st July 1881‘by Sahib Diwan, the Governor General, to the Custom House Masters at Bushire and Shiraz, and commu nicated to Her Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, prohibiting the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia. I am also to forward a copy of a notice which was issued on 14th Julv 1881 by Colonel Ross, then Her Majesty’s Resident in the Persian Gulf, notifying this prohibition to British and British Indian subjects. The text of these documents has been received by telegraph from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Sir M. Durand also states in his telegram that on 15th and 17th March 1891 the Amin-es-Sultan and the Shah himself sent telegrams to the Governor of Bushire with reference to the previous prohibition, complaining that arms had been sold by Parsee and English merchants in Tehran, and ordering the strict confiscation of all importations of arms. These telegrams were sent by the Governor of Bushire for the inspection of Her Majesty’s Resident. This reiteration of the prohibition is referred to in the Administration and trade Reports of 1891 and 1892, of which copies are enclosed for convenience of reference. It is further reported by Sir M. Durand that, in 1893, 17 cases of arms, the rersian ixuit Steamship Comp-my at Bushire for transhipment. These cases were seized by the local authorities on the ground that complaints had been received from the Turkish Government of smuggling from Persia. An appeal was made by the Agent of the Company to Her Majesty’s Resident for his good offices, which were refused with the approval of the Government of India, and the goods were confiscated. Messrs.

Governor sent telegram for Besident’s inspection. Beference to this reiteration of prohibition appears in Administration and Trade Beporfcs of 1891 (1092 A.S.) and 1892 (1252 A.S.).

I have received from Colonel Meade, Her Majesty’s Consul-General Political at Bushire, a copy of a report on the traffic in arms, and the steps taken for 2079/98. its suppression, which has, I understand, already been sent direct to your Lordship. To this report I have little to add. There can be no doubt whatever that the wholesale importation of arms of precision into Persia is dangerous to the peace of the country, and consequently injurious to our trade, and it may in time prove to be a difficulty with which the Persian Government will find it has not the power to cope. I think the Sadr-i-Azam should he supported in taking stringent measures to put an end to the import, and that the firms 'which have suffered from the confiscation of their illicit cargoes should be left to bear the loss. It is true that the import had been allowed to go on in spite of the prohibition, hut the firms concerned seem to have known quite well that they were doing what they had no right to do. They chose to run the risk, and have doubtless made large profits. There is no serious hardship in their now being left to suffer some loss. As an illustration of what I have said on this point, I attach an extract from a letter written by Messrs. Livingstone and Company to the Consul- General at Bushire on 30th October 1896. I have, &amp;c.. The Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., (Sd.) H. M. Durand. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Enclosure in above. Messrs. Livingstone, Muir, &amp; Co., to the Consul-General, Bushire. (Extract.) Bushire, 30th October 1896. Hajee Naseer Behahani, a merchant of Bushire, ordered from Livingstone, Muir, and Company, in May 1895, 300 Martini rifles for delivery at Muscat, but subsequently cancelled same and they were left on Livingstone, Muir, and Company’s hands. Livingstone, Muir, and Company shipped 250 of the said rifles to Muscat per steamship “ Zulu ” in May 1896. In April 1896 the first of a series of meetings had taken place at the house of Hajee Agha Mahomed Dedashti the Mointujar, who had offered to act as intermediary in settling a dispute regarding wheat accounts between Livingstone, Muir, and Company and Hajee Naseer Bebahaui, and at the meeting above referred to Mr. Muir was asked by the Mointujar that he should pay the equivalent of any balance his firm might be found to owe to Hajee Naseer in rifles (delivered in Bushire) which were to he shipped per “Zulu,” and the Mointujar promised to find a buyer for the remainder. Mr. Muir expressed himself inclined to consent to the proposed arrangement, hut no precise terms were discussed, the basis of the proposition being that the matters in dispute should be first settled in order to arrive at the amount to be paid to Hajee Naseer. In a subsequent private interview which Mr. Muir had with the Mointujar the latter promised to get him an undertaking from His Highness the Hissam-i-Sultani, that the guns which were to arrive at Muscat, as well as any future imports, would not be seized should they be brought on to Bushire instead of being landed at Muscat. Meantime the meetings in the Moin’s house continued to take place. Subsequently the Mointujar sent for Mahmoud Ibn Hajee Baker, the principal Persian employee of Livingstone, Muir, and Company, and askedhim to arrange that the whole of the 250 guns should be given to his (the Moin s) nephew the Nazim Tujar, on credit, and the said Mointujar promised to the said Mahmoud Ibn Hajee Baker 100 tomans to arrange this matter. Mahmoud saw Mr. Muir who meantime had received an offer of cash in advance from another Persian merchant. Mr. Muir sent a message to Mointujar that he was open to give him the 250 guns but for cash in advance.^ The Moin replied that he had only Krans 15,000 to advance. Negotiations with the Mointujar then ceased, he neither being able to pay cash or to give any but a verbal guarantee from His Highness the Hissam-i- Sultani. The 250 rifles had meantime been landed from the “ Zulu ” at Muscat, but were ordered by Livingstone, Muir, and Company to be re-shipped to Bushire, the above-mentioned merchant having made 40,000 krans payment in advance, and having contracted to take all consequences of seizure, and the guns were ultimately landed in Bushire by him.

In the case of the other Governments possessing territories on or in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, viz., the Government of India and the Turkish Government, a similar prohibition exists, whilst it is also being enforced in their own territories by the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikh of Bahrein. If, however, my honourable friend desires by his question to ask whether the prohibition enacted by the Persian Government is being equally enforced against arms of other than British origin, I may inform him that special inquiries have been made on the subject, and we learn by telegraph that the prohibition is universal, and that the import of foreign, no less than of British, arms has ceased.

If the Belgian firms, whose consignments have been seized, will call upon the consignees to state the facts to the British Consular Authority, that officer will afford to them the same assistance as he would give in the case of goods despatched by British firms.

Mr. IIedderwjck (Wick Burghs) asked the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether his attention had been drawn to the judgment of Mr. Justice Bigham delivered on the 5th instant, in the case of “ Eracis, Times, &amp; Co. v. the Sea Insurance Company (Limited),” in which the learned Judge mentioned found that the import of arms (into Persia) was not J illegal according to the law of Persia, as that law was administered in practice &gt; and enjoined, and the export of arms from England to Persia was certainly not contrary to our law; and whether, having regard to this judgment, Her Majesty's Government would consider the question of compensating the owners of the cargo of arms and ammunition stopped in transition on hoard the “ Beluchistan” on 24th January by the Commander of H.M.S. “Lapwing,” and the owners of the arms and ammunition stored in Bushire which were &gt; seized and confiscated by Her Majesty’s Consul-General in December 1897, and by him handed over to the Persian authorities after they had passed the Persian customs, and duties upon them had been paid to and received by the Persian authorities to whom they were so handed over. Mr. Ctjrzon.—I have seen the report of the Judgment in question, but I do not think that its purport can be correctly estimated by the quotation of \ a single sentence from it. The learned Judge found that there was some- ; thing in the nature of a prohibition against the importation of arms into Persia, and that the Plaintiffs probably knew of it, but that the circum stances as known to them were not material to the Defendants in estimating the risk. The facts are not correctly stated in the second question. The arms and ammunition stored in Bushire were not seized and confiscated by Her Majesty’s Consul-General, who could have no authority to take such a step on Persian soil. They were seized by an official of the Persian Govern- L ment, and the British Vice-Consul was present because the goods were in the possession of British subjects. Her Majesty’s Government see no ground for interference unless, in the case of any of the arms seized either at Muscat or Bushire, the owners or consignees can prove that the arms were proceeding to or had entered Persia with the authority of the Persian Government, and the parties concerned have been advised, if they can produce such proofs, to represent their claims to the Consular authorities. Replying to a further question, Mr. Curzon said Her Majesty’s Government had always held the opinion, which he had more than once stated in the House, that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia was illicit, and it w r as upon that assumption they had proceeded.

I am to remind you that the purport of your letterf of the 18th of June t Political. No. 2,073/98 was . th , at y ou had laid oat considerable capital m “a particular trade in weapons for the Persian Gulf, “ made in such a manner as to preclude their sale elsewhere.” This trade you explained had suffered from the “recent trouble ” and stoppage of importation of arms in the Gulf, and you added that the stoppage “has a serious effect on the working classes of Birmingham.”Other statements have been received and have appeared in the press to the effect that the recent enforcement of its orders by the Persian Government has entailed serious loss to the Birmingham trade. But the information before his Bordship does not bear out this view, and tends to show that the hulk of arms and ammunition illicitly imported into Persia was made abroad and not in Birmingham, although the barrels made abroad and fitted abroad have been tested in Birmingham. Lord Salisbury was therefore anxious to obtain more precise information as to the actual shipments of the arms made by you, and the extent of loss caused to British workmen and to your firm by the suspension of the shipments. You were consequently asked to supply particulars as to the total quantity of guns shipped by you in the past year. To this you reply that you have shipped none to Persia during that period. There is, therefore, no evidence of previous trade on your part before the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs on which he could found any representations on your behalf to the Persian Government. Butfitis open to any agent or correspondent of your firm in Persia to apply, through Her Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, for a special permit for the entry of sporting guns, provided it can be shown that the destination of the guns precludes the risk of their being put to improper use.

No appeal has been made to me by merchants, but I find that representations were made in December and January by Messrs. Dixon, Fracis Times, and Livingstone Muir to Resident at Bushire who referred to Legation. It was not urged that prohibition was unknown to shippers or consignees, but merchants argue that prohibition was nominal, and that arms were imported [openly] with permission of Persian authorities and consent of Resident. I cannot find that any answer was sent to Messrs. Dixon or Fracis Times, but answer in case of Livingstone Muir was, that, though not rigidly enforced, prohibition had never been withdrawn, and that recent seizures had been made with approval of Her Majesty’s Government. There is no doubt that illicit traffic was carried on with connivance of Persian local authorities, but it might not be easy to prove connivance of Persian Government. Since my return Belgian Minister consulted me regarding possibility of release of some Belgian arms belonging to Fracis Times on the ground that they were sporting weapons. I answered that almost all could be used as military weapons, that prohibition applied even to sporting weapons, and that I feared Her Majesty’s Government would be unable to help Times, but that this was my private opinion only.

It appears to us that if it be the fact that the import of arms has practically been allowed on payments to Persian officials, it would not be reasonable that the Persian Government should seize and retain such a consignment of arms. They are, of course, at liberty to prohibit the importation for the future, but it would not be right that they should appropriate a parcel of arms, which never would have been sent, but for the belief induced by the action of their own officials that the importation would be permitted.

I am now to transmit, for the information of the Marquis of * No 108 fSecreD Salisbury, a copy of a letter* of the secret). ^ of ^ Govem _ ment of India, with its enclosures, on this subject. It is evident from it that, in the case of Messrs. Fracis Times &amp; Co., as well as of other exporters of arms to the Gulf, the circumstances of each shipment, and sometimes of each package in a shipment, must vary considerably. Accordingly, when any exporter, or consignee, of such goods appeals• 87 against their seizure by a Foreign Government, a reference must be made to the British Consular authority at the place where the arms were seized, in order that the precise facts may be ascertained; and, as a rule, parties aggrieved should seek redress by a direct appeal to the British authorities on the spot. 8. Dealing then with the several seizures of arms at different places which form the subject of the firm’s complaint, I am to refer, in the first place, to the seizure of arms at Bahrein, regarding which Messrs. Fracis Times wrote: —“ It appears that recently arms and ammunition “ belonging to us of the value of upwards of 12,00(B. sterling have been “ seized and confiscated by the British Consul at Bahrein.” The true facts appear to be these. In 1896 Messrs. Fracis Times asked the Assistant Resident at Bushire to give them a letter of introduction to the Chief of Bahrein for commercial purposes. Thereupon they were required to give an assurance that they did not intend to deal in arms there, an assurance which must at least have reminded them of the Persian prohibition. They, however, evaded this difficulty by entering into negotiations with a merchant named Agha Mahomed Rahim, who was also employed as a British newsagent at Bahrein. This man had obtained from the Sheikh’s Vizier a concession of a monopoly of the local trade in arms, which the Chief had previously given to his Vizier, and he, in his turn, now made it over to Messrs. Fracis Times. Last year Messrs. Fracis Times fell out with Agha Mahomed Rahim, and also with the Native merchants or buniahs. Civil proceedings were in due course instituted by Agha Mahomed against Messrs. Fracis Times, which are still pending ; and then the Sheikh, quite independently of any action taken, or any advice given, by the British Resident, took possession in January last of the stock of arms and ammunition stored up by Messrs. Fracis Times at Bahrein. It was not until the end of April last that the firm took the obvious and proper course of sub mitting their protest against the Chief’s action to the Resident, and the matter is still under consideration. The inquiry will throw light upon the proceedings of the British newsagent in this matter, which at first sight seem to require justification; but, pending a final report from the Government of India, Lord George Hamilton is unable to state whether Messrs. Fracis Times will eventually establish their title to a restitution of the stock of arms which are still in the custody of the Sheikh, or, in other words, of the Government of Bahrein. The main conclusion indicated by these facts is that the British Consular authorities in the Gulf were not aware of and w r ere not responsible for the seizure com plained of; and that Messrs. Fracis Times’ losses at Bahrein are entirely distinct from the other seizures to which their statement refers. Their claim to restitution depends on the result of the legal proceedings referred to and upon further inquiry into the circumstances. 4. Passing on to the seizures of the firm’s arms at Bushire, I am to observe that there is nothing to support either their plea of ignorance of the Persian Government’s orders prohibiting the import into Persia, or their allegation that the “ British Consul there, acting on behalf of “ the British Government, seized ” the arms referred to. The former question of the prohibition will be discussed presently, and here it is sufficient to dispose of the latter allegation. The real fact is that the British Vice-Consul merely attended the seizure by the Persian officials, in response to the request of the Persian Government, in order to witness the proceedings and to formally sanction the entry of Persian officers upon the premises of a British firm. The arms seized by the Persian authorities on Persian territory have been sent by them to Tehran, and Messrs. Fracis Times must now r either prove to the Persian Government their right to import them into Persian territory, or else satisfy Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that there are sufficient grounds for his interference. 5. The next complaint refers to the seizure of the arms carried by the “ Baluchistan ” into Maskat waters, regarding which there is theformal decision of the Maskat Court, dated the 15th of April 1898, that the arms were intended for Persian ports, that after leaving the British port the marks of destination were altered at “ Port Said ’’ on board the ship in order to mislead, that H.M.S. “ Lapwing ” acted in accordance with the permission given by His Highness the Sultan, and that the seizure was legal and proper. At this stage it will be convenient to review the proceedings taken by the Persian and Maskat Governments, in order to examine the plea that Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co. were ignorant of the Persian prohibition upon the import of arms into Persia. Some short account of the practices of the trade can then be given. 6. It is not necessary to go further back than the 14th of July 1880, when Mr. Lyall, Secretary to the Government of India, wrote to the &lt;£ have now no doubt that a very large proportion of these percussion “caps” (entered in a return of ammunition shipped to Bushire in 1880) “ were sent through Persia to the Afghan frontier, and were sold “ to Afghan troops at Herat and elsewhere.” It was added that “ the “ control of the export of this ammunition to the Persian littoral has “ therefore, become a matter of special political and military importance. ,, As a step in the direction of stopping the trade, a Notification, No. 1560, dated 1st October 1880, was issued and published in the Official Gazette by the Government of India, which excluded the following arms, &amp;c., namely, consignments to any port “on the sea-board of the Persian Gulf,” from the terms of a General Order exempting (under Section 27 of the Indian Arms Act, 1878), from the prohibitions contained in Section 6 of the Act, arms, ammunition, and military stores brought into an Indian port which may be declared under manifest to be con signments, without transhipment, to another port. The general public were thus informed, in the most emphatic way, of the interests of the Government of India in checking the traffic in arms to Persian ports. It has now to be seen what action was taken in Persia itself. On the 7th of May 1880 Lord Hartington addressed the Foreign Office with a view to the Persian Government being requested to do all in their power to prevent exportation of war material from Persia into Afghanistan. Mr. Thomson, on the 12th of May 1880, informed Lord Granville that the Persian Government had issued peremptory orders accordingly. In vernments that the trade in arms with Persian ports was prohibited. This order, as observed by Mr. Justice Bigham, was, in course of time, suffered to remain a “ nominal prohibition,” and, from the evidence before him in the suit of Fracis Times &amp; Co. v. The Sea Insurance Company, the Judge was led to the conclusion that Messrs. Fracis Times “ knew, as the fact was, that it was never acted upon.” But this inference was based on the slender evidence produced in Court, and it is therefore necessary to advert to certain facts which have a material bearing upon tne plea of ignorance put forward in the “ Statement ” under consideration. From Sir M. Durand’s telegram, dated 10th June 1898, to the Foreign Office, it appears that, on 13th June 1881, due notice of the Prohibition of 1880 was given to British merchants in Bushire. It is, however, more material to the issue to see what occurred in more recent years, when Messrs. Fracis Times engaged actively in the trade. In 1891 the Governor of Bushire was ordered to confiscate gll importations, and to carry out the prohibition with strictness. In the same vear His Highness the Sultan of Maskat formally prohibited the import of arms into Gwadur, whence a caravan route led into British Baluchistan. Thus by the year 1891 common action was being taken by the Government of India, the Government of Persia, and the Government of Maskat. Two years later Messrs. VV. J. Towell &amp; Co., of Maskat, complained to the British authorities of the S. 13. L * See Government of India Letter No. 227 (Secret), dated 2nd November 1880. Government of Bombay* pointing out “ that, from information re- “ ceived, the Government of India j See Foreign Office Letter to India Office of 13th August 1881. July 1881 the Persian Government took a step forward.! It notified to the British and other foreign Go-stoppage at Bushire of 13 cases of rifles and four cases of ammunition belonging to them, alleged to be intended for Maskat. Interference on their behalf was, however, refused by the Consular authorities, and the arms were duly confiscated. On the 8th of April 1895 the Sadr-i-Azam addressed Sir M. Durand in these terms:—“ According to the reports “ received from the ports in the Persian Gulf fire-arms are imported “ from time to time as e merchandize 5 into the interior of the country “ through the ports. When any officials of the Persian Government get “ to know of the fact, the owners pretend that the arms are destined for “ the district of Oman. In order to prevent this pretext it is necessary “ that an order should be issued to the effect that all fire-arms intended “ for Oman should .be imported direct by sea without entering the “ ports of the Persian Gulf.” The Persian Minister added that “ fire-arms “ found in the ports shall be confiscated by order of the Persian “ Government.” It was after this renewal of activity on the part of the Persian Government that Messrs. Pracis Times turned their attention, as already shown in paragraph 3 of this letter, to the establishment of a dep6t on the island of Bahrein. That the prohibition of the Persian Government was well known to the trade, and that its consequences were feared, is evident from Messrs. Livingstone, Muir, &amp; Co.’s com- „ , _ __ _ . munication to the Consul-General No 77“tr.”is t Vn , :im Durand ’ ^ f Bushire, dated 30th October 1896,* in respect to certain rifles carried by the “Zulu,' in which it is clearly stated that a contract was entered into “ to take all consequences of seizure ” at Bushire. The reply given to Messrs. Pracis Times when they applied for an intro duction to the Sheikh of Bahrein must be read in connection with these facts. In 1896 a special preventive officer, Ibrahim Khan, was appointed by the Persian Government, and he held his office till November 1897. He was succeeded after a brief interval by the Malek- ut-Tujar, who, on the 1st December 1897, informed the British Consul General at Bushire that he had been ordered to seize arms illicitly imported, and that he had received information regarding a con- x c* tt 1 i ^ t signmentf brought in by a Parsee t zS'cc Enclosure to Foreign Office Letter, j -a/t -m • nr dated 22nd April 1898. firm named Messrs. Pracis Times. It was on the 7th of December that the premises of Messrs. Pracis Times, and on the 11th following that those of Messrs. Dixon and Messrs. Livingstone Muir, were searched at Bushire. While these events were occurring at Bushire the S.S. “ Baluchistan ” sailed from “ Manchester ” on the 8th of December, and after taking in a further supply of arms at Marseilles, she left that port on the 27th of December. On the 23rd of December, while she was still at Marseilles, the shipowners, Messrs. Strick &amp; Co., wrote to the Poreign Office stating that they were informed that the Persian Government had given orders to prohibit the importation of arms. They stated that “ our S.S. 1 Baluchistan ’ had already left this country “ for the Persian Gulf with a quantity of arms and ammunition on board, “ before the shippers, or ourselves as carriers, had cognizance of this “ decision.” They added that their agents had referred to the British Besident, who stated “ that the arms are liable to be seized and con fiscated in Persian waters,” and they asked for “ protection in this matter.” Obviously their application implied that their shipments were meant for Persia, and as Her Majesty’s Government made no promise of protection the shippers must be presumed to have been aware of the risk they ran. This inference is strengthened by the precautions of secrecy taken by the persons engaged in the trade, to which reference will be made directly. 7. Before, however, that point is dealt with, I am to refer to the circumstances which led to the seizure of the arms on board the “Baluchistan” in Maskat waters, by the authority of the sovereign of Maskat. The Sultan of Maskat had, previously to the arrival of the ship, undertaken to assist the Government of Persia in carrying out its prohibition, just as His Highness had in 1891 assisted the British51 99 Government by prohibiting the importation of arms into Gwadur. The British Government, whose interests in the matter have been traced from 1880, could not allow a portion of the cargo of a British ship to be seized in Maskat waters without proper securities; and, just as, in the case of entry into warehouses in Bushire owned by British subjects, it authorised its consular officers to watch proceedings and by their presence to assist the territorial [authorities in enforcing the law, so in the waters of Maskat it co-operated with the Sultan in enforcing his orders. H.M.S. “ Lapwing,” accordingly, took part in the seizure of the arms, and its proceedings on behalf of the Sultan were subsequently reviewed, and adjudged by a Maskat Court of Inquiry to have been correct and legal. At that inquiry Messrs. Eracis Times might have put forward their claim if they could have proved it, and even now. Lord George Hamilton understands, it is open to them, if they can do so, to prove to the satisfaction of the British Political Agent that any case or cases which have been seized, were not really, notwith standing Messrs. Strick &amp; Co’s, letter of the 23rd of December, and the other proofs of destination, intended for Persia, or that, if so intended, they were being lawfully imported into that country. Such a claim can obviously be best proved at Maskat where the arms are; and in the absence of such proof it does not seem that the Sultans decision and action can be properly questioned. 8. Some light is thrown upon the plea of ignorance, which is alleged, by an examination of the contention made by Messrs. Eracis Times and others to the effect that the trade in arms has been carried on in the most open maimer. Lord George Hamilton has already dealt with this matter in my letter of the 1st of December last, and further inquiries have only confirmed the facts then stated. Shippers have of course been obliged to give to the British Customs authorities to some extent truthful specifications, but in those documents, such as a bill of lading, which may reach the eyes of the authorities at the port of destination, they have frequently either concealed or misrepresented the facts. A large proportion of the arms and ammunition exported to the Persian Gulf is made in Belgium, where Messrs. Eracis Times obtained a portion of their shipments by the “ Baluchistan,” and the other ships which preceded it; and although the barrels may have been sent over to Birmingham to be proved they were returned to Li6ge to be made up. As to the ammunition, it is significant that a leading firm of Birmingham manufacturers, Messrs. Kynoch, sent in a written protest, dated 15th February last, against the practice resorted to by shippers to the Gulf, of exporting Belgian ammunition as if it were British. Steps have now been taken by the Customs authorities, in the issue of a notice, dated 26th February 1898, to prevent in future the misdescription of explosives of Foreign origin as if they were of British origin. But a more serious and comnym class of misrepresentation may be illustrated by two complaints, which the seizure of the very arms now under discussion on board the “Baluchistan” has brought to light. As a rule, secrecy has been aimed at by not giving the name of the consignees in the returns given to the Customs authority. But on some occasions when this omission has been made a matter of comment, false names of consignees have been supplied. Thus, when the arms carried by the “ Baluchistan ” were seized, an Indian subject of Her Majesty trading at Maskat, named Gopalji Walji, found that no less than 33 cases of arms made in Belgium, but sent by that ship, were consigned to him, and the Bills of Lading were made out accordingly. He, however, denied all knowledge of the transaction. In the same way a firm in Mincing Lane consigned 236,000 cartridges to Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., of Bushire, in whose name the bills of entry were made out. The consignees, however, have formally denied that they had ever been engaged in the arms traffic, and repudiated the transaction. 9. It is perhaps unnecessary to detail other instances of concealment and misdescription which have come to notice. Special inquiries intothe practice of the trade were instituted before the assistance asked for by the territorial authorities in the Gulf was granted. Their result led to the inference that, however ignorant the Birmingham and Belgian manufacturers might be of the manner in which their goods were dis posed of, the shippers and exporters must have been fully alive to the risks they ran, and that they accordingly resorted to numerous devices to conceal the destination of their exports, and even in some cases to conceal the character of the goods carried under the name of “ Hardware.” 10. In conclusion, I am to offer the following general remarks regarding British interests in the suppression of this trade. Messrs. Fracis Times, in their statement dated 7th March 1898, mention 3,800 rifles, besides ammunition, seized in their go-downs in Bushire, arms and ammunition of the value of 12,000Z. sterling seized at their depot on Bahrein, and 700Z. worth of arms seized on board the “Baluchistan,” independently of a stock of arms at Maskat which they value at 9,000/. If these operations of a single firm of Parsee and British partners represent at all the magnitude of the trade in Belgian and British arms which other firms are conducting, the matter becomes one of most serious importance. In the first place, such a traffic is endangering legitimate British trade in other commodities with the interior. Serious complaints have been received of the insecurity of the trade routes in Persia, especially in Southern Persia. Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 27th of June last, repeats the opinion expressed by his predecessor in these terms :—“ There can be no doubt whatever “ that the wholesale importation of arms of precision into Persia is “ dangerous to the peace of the country, and consequently injurious to “ our trade.” From other parts of the Gulf the same injury to trade is reported. In the case of the piratical attack on the sailing vessel “ Kalianpasa,” committed on the 2nd December near Saihan point in the Shatt-el-Arab river, the crew were killed by fire-arms. This outrage is not the only one of a similar character, and in April last the Assistant Political Agent at Basrah reported that Hasan Khyun intended to interfere with the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi gation Company plying on the river. Then again, on the Arab coast, the intervention of the Indian Government to uphold the Sultan of Maskat’s authority has been more than once exercised of late years, and the arming of the rebels is felt by His Highness to constitute an element of danger to the Sultan’s rule. The attack upon the British survey party in Baluchistan, and the murder of Mr. Graves on the Persian side of the border, which followed the perpetration of several attacks upon the property and persons of British subjects in the employ of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, illustrate a condition of affairs which must be seriously aggravated by allowing an illicit traffic in arms to continue. In this connection I am to invite attention to my letter of the 11th of May last, suggesting the need for systematic enforcement by the Persian Government of its regulations against all importers and others who are taking part in the prohibited traffic in arms. Lastly there is the danger felt in 1880, when only caps, smooth bore guns, and even flint locks were being carried through Persian ports into Afghanistan. It was ascertained by special inquiry that Biluch and Afghan agents were, during the late frontier disturbances, sent down to Maskat to await the arrival of the S.S. “Tresco” and “Baluchistan.” The makers in Belgium, who have supplied Messrs. Fracis Times and others with Martini-Henry rifles, procured last year from England the exact dimensions of the chambers of the rifles used by the Indian Government; and although Messrs. Fracis Times state that the market is glutted, the traffic attained its highest dimensions last year, when the Indian Frontier was most disturbed. Several cases of the identical cartridues which were exported from Manchester but made in Belgium were found in February last in the house of Mir Suka in Pasni, and Afghan caravans were in April last awaiting in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas their expected consignments.
