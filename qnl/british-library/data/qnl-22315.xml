To Political Resident on board s.s. Vita. No. 120 • Dated 10th July 1938. I should be grateful for information regarding your plans. If I am not wanted I should like begin arrangements for recess in Ziarat. - POLITICAL -Confidential \o D.O. No. C/11-12/16 Dated the 5th January 1939* Dear Sir Trenchard, As you are aware, I only succeeded in getting away from Bahrain last summer for three 'weeks, one of which I spent in bed in Karachi, and having now experienced the results of an insufficient period of recess from the steamy heat of Manamah, I am anxious not to repeat the dose this coming year. It is of course impossible at this stage to foresee whether the political situation will oermit me to take the full three months allowed but I am writing to you now to submit the following 'brain-wave' (as it seems to me). 2. I should like to take my change of air in TSurooe. I know we have not yet reached the stage when recess in Europe is normally allowed, but it occurs to me that re cess or deputation in London might be iustified if it were thought that I was capable of bringing P.G. 13 uo to date. P.G. 13 is so extraordinarily valuable that it is a pity that it does not go beyond 1928, and I should very much like to try my hand at bringing it up to 1939. I can claim a moderately complete knowledge of affairs affecting Bahrain and the Coast from Hasa to Kelba, and having twice acted for you last year I have some slight background of knowledge of affairs in Muscat and Kuwait. It ought not therefore to take me an undue length of time to extract the requisite meat from the India Office files for a revision. 3. I trust I shall not be thought unduly presumptuous in making this very tentative suggestion, which after all can be turned down in a couple of minutes if it is regarded os in appropriate t Yours sincerely, The Hobble Lieu tenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIE, CBE rencnara .ruwi.c, r^v^xa, uoej, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BushireH Confidential The Residency Bush ire, the 11th January, 1939 D.O,No.39-S. Could you please refer to your demi-official letter r No* c/ll-12/16, dated the 5th January 1939, on the subject of your proposal to recess in London ? by which the Resident goes home every year on leave, and during that leave he is put part of that time on deputation, I am sympathetic towards proposals of a similar nature l I am afraid, however, that it wDUld be no good my sending on your proposal* I agree that it would be a good thing to bring P*G.l3 up to date, but I am sure our Higher Authorities would not think it worth while to put you on recess or deputation for this purpose alone. Moreover there would be^question of your office staff etc., and I think it would be difficult for you to run Bahrain even under recess conditions from Whitehall• 2 Nothing like ideas, and since I started the precedent the H* Weightman Esquire, I.C.S*, Political Agent BahrainExtract from P.R’s '3 ,, telegram No. 353, dated 3rd July 1939. I would like very much to let you have your recess. International situation hov/ever is obviously deteriorating thou di I have had no warning and crucial months appear to be July Agust and September. 2. If war does break out then first fortnight would be a crucial period when your rnsence at your &gt; 03 1 would be essential. War will probably breal out v/ithout any arning arid if you ere absent, ov ir ' to consequent interrupted communication^ (Or. utd) you are not delayed in returning to your post. Please therefore do not make any definite arrangements for recess. I will telegraph later if I consi .er recess o•sible•D.O.No. C/412- 12/16. The 8th July 1939 /'l ^ill you please refer to your telecram No* 353^ datel the 3rd July. 2. I an considerably disturbed at the prospect of having to spend my second consecutive sucii er in Bahrnin. As you know| I w&amp;s able to get away only for 3 weeks last anmn er, part of which I 3 &gt;ent in bed and part convalescing. 3. As you have yourself said on several occasions, one can only expect to keep one's health in this place — and consequently be of real use -- if one gets clear av/ay for part of every suiaier. If war breaks out there will be no leave for the duration and the prospect of a transfer must be remote. It is all the more important, therefore, to try to start off 100 % fit. Moreover, since it is diffici to believe that air communications between India and E ypt will cease forthwith in the event of war or the threat of war, I can see no reason to fear that T could not return from my recess station to Bahrain within 48 hours if the A need arose. 4. Before, therefore, you prohibit recess and thus deprive the three Political Agents on this Coast of their very necessary health insurance, I would earnestly reouest you to telegraph to London to enquire if the European situation is causing all diplomatic, consular, Sudan and Colonial Service people to be detained at their posts this sumraer and all leave to the three Defence Services to be stopped.

Last year Hallows got none at all and everyone else only had a very limited change from the Gulf. If recess is cancelled this year, it will only he a question of time before people start breaking dov/n. The arrangements 1 suggest for Bahrain are as follows: Hallows should go at a date convenient to you, and Metcalfe should do his work in addition to his own. As soon as Hickinbotham returns, Howes will return to Bahrain, to enable you to get away. When Hallows returns from recess Metcalfe will be able to take his turn. By this means there will never be less than two officers in Bahrain, which should suffice. If you see any difficulty in carrying out these proposals or would like to alter them please let me know ? 2.

A 0 Please refer to the enclosures to your Printed letter Ho•861-64/136 of 1st July 1940. 2« Owing to the war } recess in the Middle East seems out of the question, and in any case, now that I have been warned for the Truciel Coast in the autumn, it would be financially quite impossible for my wife to accompany me to Alexandria and then go all the way back to India for the cold weather. Under rule, therefore, I should only go to either Karachi or Quetta. Many exceptions have however been made and with these precedents in view and also for the reason given in my original request, I would be very grateful if I could be allowed to go to Kashmir. 3. When in Bushlre, I received the impression that Colonel Prior was not generally against my going there but considered Alexandria to be better; I also retain the impression that he did not consider Karachi very healthy in September. This ^ leaves only Quetta, which has nothing to recommend it so far as Arabic is concerned. (For that matter, nor has Karachi). From a purely personal and financial point of view, Kashmir would suit me far better and so far as re-call is concerned, we can now only take into consideration the time required to reach Karachi from the recessing station. In this respect, Kashmir is as suitable as Ouetta/Ziarat, for one leaves there in the morning by car via the Banihal (which is always open), reaches Lahore in time to catch the Karachi moil that night and is in Karachi the next morning. There is also a regular Captain A.C* Stewart, air /- Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire.air service between Lahore and Karachi and an air taxi service from Lahore to Srinagar* 4. If however Colonel Prior is unable to support this proposal, I would request that I may be granted three weeks* leave on full average pay* This, conbined with the join ing time admissible, would give me about six weeks away from Bahrain* According to present schedules, there is a down Fast Mail due in Bahrain on August 24th but then none until September 14th 5 my recess or leave might therefore begin from the former date* Yours sincerely,(§)Gf* THLEGRAM Froa Political Agent, Bahrain, To Political Resident, Bushire.

In practice this will mean that the A.P.A. will carry on with the work that he is now doing and the Publicity Officer will deal with routine and current affairs which are normally dealt with by the P.A. Questions other than current or routine will be referred to me either by air mail or telegraphically according to urgency. Some of the matters which should be referred to me are those concerning land i.e. military requirements for landing grounds or other defence purposes, requirements by the Company, drilling by the Company on Pashts or islands of doubtful owner ship in the vicinity of Bahrain, personnel questions i.e. Bapco personnel who try to evade their obligations to the Company by sailing for South Africa, Canada etc. Most questions eoattrning Qatar and the Trucial Coast should be reffered to me. The Defence Officer has not got a free hand in routine matters in dealing with these areas as he has in Bahrain. The Defence Officer and the Military Mission should be carefully watched to see that they refer all matters which are not strictly routine to this office. All coownan*cations between the State and Military Naval authorities and the Bapco should be dealt with through the Agency. We d o not of course wish to be bothered with really petty matters such as purchase of chandals etc. and it is really a matter for discretion as to which matters are of sufficient importance to go through the Agency. The /•The Political Agent’s magisterial functions i.e# deportations etc, and the functions of the Registrar of Marriages f Births and Deaths etc. will he in abeyance while I am on recess. Matters concerning office personnel and menial estab lishment will be dealt with as usual by the A.P.A. expenditure is incurred if possibles As somewhat heavy expenditure has taken place during the winter on repairs and additions to the Agency etc. I should kile expenditure under these heads to cease entirely for the time being. The Agency Miscellaneous fund needs a rest and no expenditure should be incurred if possible. As regards the launch, plans for this have been given to the builders and the work will proceed subject to frequent inspections by the A.P.A. As regards the sale of 'Felix Jones' Khalil Kanoo is about to receive a cheque for Rs 12,500 from the Navy which he should pay to us for crediting to the Agency Miscellane ous funds under the heading sale of 'Felix Jones'• This money will be utilised towards payment for the building of the new launch and part of it will be required for payment for the purchase of the new engine.
