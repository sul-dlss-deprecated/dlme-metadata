(b) Agent showed Political Agent a form of concession which Pastori wished to make with the Sheikhs of Dibah and Ras-al-Khaimah to cover exploit of minerals. Oil was not included, but concession covered construction of aerodrome, post clfice, harbours, W-T-, and import of armament of all kinds Further, Pas tori's Company undertook to protect the Sheikh through Company's Government from invasion and attacks. (c) Fastori’s instructions to agent were to visit Dibah and Ras-al-Khaimah. If these Sheikhs were willing to give concession, agent was to telegraph an agreed code message to Soussa, P.O.Box 45, (? Baghdad), before March 14th. No arrangement had been made for message in contrary sense. 5.

(1 enclose another copy for ease of reference). It is a little (laqaleting that an Italian Agent should apparently be wandering about the Gulf endeavouring to obtain , rab labourers for employ^ient in Eritrea. Ae you may know, we had considerable discuL5Bion towards the end of 1935 about the employment of labour by the Italians in Aden, and the Resident at Aden (in his capacity of ^hief Comraijjsioner under the ( ovemment of India) was given special powers to prohibit emigration. This was done partly with regard to His Majesty’s Government’s position of neutrality towards the Abyssinian ^Var, but mainly because It was felt that British Subjects and British Protected Persons recruited In Aden for employment in Italian Colonies might/ T. v • Brenan, Rsti*, v).B. , Foreign Office, S.W.l.2 . might not be well treated and might have to work under unsatisfactory conditions. There does not seem to be any reason to take any very acrious action as regards Pastori’s visit to the dulf* particularly as he only seems to have spent about a week at Muscat# but it might perhaps be worth giving some friendly warning to the Sultan (and to the : uler o: any other State wliich Pastori may subsequently visit)* If you agree# I propose to submit that we should telegraph to the Resident suggesting that# ii’ he sees no objection# he should convey to the Sultan and to any other Ruler whose territory may be visited by Pastori or any other Italian Agent# a warning that it cannot be guaranteed from the infoririation available to His Majesty’s Government# that anybo y who enters Italian ei jployment of this kind in ’ ritrea or Abyssinia will find that the conditions of work are altogether healthy or suitable.
