No* C/446 Dated the 9th July 1933* I should be extremely grateful for any advice you could give me on the following matter* 2. The Shaikh of Dubai is having a good deal of trouble over his Customs organisation* At the present moment he has an absurd system of charging so much per package} irrespect ive of the size or value of its contents, and the only per son who is making any money out of the Dubai Customs is the Persian Director. 3. As you know Dubai is a small port, but quite important as they go on the Trucial Coast* Owing to the present absurd Customs system, I have no means of saying what the value of imports and exports may be, but we might periiaps put it at something between one-tenth^ and one-fifth^ of the Bahrain trade* Can you suggest any simple system, based on the Bahrain Customs system generally, which might be applied to a port of this size, and could be operated without 50 per cent or more of the proceeds going in peculation. It would I fear be necei.sary to rely wholely on local talent for filling the Customs posts,so one wants something reasonably fool proof. 4 # I am afraid it is rather a tall order to ask for your advice on such limited data, but if you could perhaps outline a system based generally on your own in Bahrain which might run without having the constant supervision which you yourself apply to the Bahrain system, I shall be infinitely grateful* Yours sincerely, de Crenier, Ksquire*, 3i ectoi 1 of Customs and 'do * Port Officer, Bahrain.2. While in my judgment the ad valorem system is the most equitable both for Government and also for the importers, the services of literate experienced clerks are necessary to handle values based upon invoices etc. A new system for D$bai should be one which the Ruler himself could check. 3. I would suggest the introduction of the same type of tariff as I use here for local native craft but making it applicable to all imports and exports, and based upon a standardised five per cent local valuation of the import, but classified according to the unit container, e.g. case, bag, raffa, crate, jotta; with a basic maund weight of 56 lbs avoirdupois. This in operation is really simple, but requires a set of good scales. I enclose a copy of our tariff to illustrate my point; this is revised annually to be consistent with local values. The Bahrain tariff was instituted to protect illiterate local imported from being defrauded by their brokers; so that any Arab or Iranian can tell what the Customs dues are. It should be published at the Customs and in the Bazar. 4. The steamers’ manifests of cargo could be analysed to shew the number and kinds of packages; and similarly native craft could either produce a manifest or have one made for them, as is our practice here. 5. To b^jin#, I would suggest the collection of dues only per unit of package, which could also be weighed, so that a small package should not pay so much as a large package. The only difficulty would be the preparation of the Tariff; and then an honest man would be required to give effect to it on the Ruler’s behalf. The Ruler could easily see the number of packages imported from each vessel, and calculate the sum he should receive, and receive it in toto for each vessel. 6. It would be safest for the remuneration of the Ruler’s Mudir to be a percentage of his gross possible collections, against the Ruler’s receipt, say ten per cent; and he should be required to maintain his own staff of clerks out of that, except naturs and guards who should be the Ruler’s appointed servants. The Mudir should not be a subject of the Ruler (lest he shew favour to his friends), but preferably a British subject, as this prestige would help him to maintain the Ruler’s authority in introducing a new scheme which is sure to be unpopular until its equity is proved. 7. The tariff should be fixed upon a broad basis and not completely water-tight, when, as time goes on and merchants learn that they are being fairly treated; it could be made more effective. Believe me, — v ~To:-H. Weight man Esqui H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN:I Confidential Political Agency, Bahrain, the 1st August 1938* Ho. C/498-22/8 To The Residency Agent, Sharj ah. M emor andum You will remember when I was last in Sharjah we dis cussed the possibility of giving the Shaikh of Dubai some advice in regard to the revision of his Customs system. I have now discussed this matter in detail with the Director of Customs here and I think the following will be the best scheme for Dubai, if you can get the Shaikh to agree to it. 2. The first thing to do is to discover the value of all articles imported into Dubai bazaar or exported by sea from Dubai. This value should be fixed according to standard u local weights, i.e. at so much per maund (the maund of course should be a fixed weight and not a variable weight) or so much per bundle, tin, raff a, crate or jotta. It should be perfectly easy to find out such values in consultation with the merchants. Having done this, a fixed tariff should then be prepared at five per cent of the value of a maund, bundle etcetera of each article, and this tariff should then be published at the Customs House and all over the bazaar. I enclose herewith a copy of the fixed Customs Duty Schedule which is used in Bahrain to show you how this should be made out. 3. Wh r a steamer comes to Dubai a copy of the ship’s And in the case of dhows and smaller craft, the Customs Ins pector could prepare this manifest for the nakhuda by actual manifest should be obtained showing the cargo landed in Dubai. examination of the cargo brought in. Then from this information/-information and from the schedule of duties, it is very easy to w ork out exactly what sum of money is due on the whole cargo landed* Of course the actual duty collected may be taken from several different people, but by this system the Shaikh himself can always check collections and see that he actually receives the amount which should be collected by the Customs Department* 4. The schedule of duties should remain in force for about a year and then be revised according to local market rates, but whenever such a revision is made the new tariff should of course be published so that everybody knows exactly where he stands* 5* It is obvious that if a system of this sort is to be successful the Shaikh must have an honest man in charge of his Customs Department, and he must make sure that that man employs two or three literate clerks one at least of whom knows English* It will of course be far better to employ someone who is not a Dubai subject for the post of Customs Inspector, since there wil] then be less chance of his preparing false manifests at the re quest of some friend of his in Xibai. However, even if this is not possible and if the Shaikh has to employ some of his own peo ple to run the Customs Department, the scheme set out above should be reasonably fool-proof; and if the Shaikh takes a per sonal interest in it he can do a lot to ensure that there is no dishonesty. In order to make even more certain that there is no dishonesty, I suggest that the best way of paying tlie Mu dir or Inspector would be by giving him a percentage of the total collections. If for instance he gets ten per cent of the Customs duty received this would be more than suffi cient for his own pay and for him to maintain his own staff3- of clerks. The Shaikh of coarse would have to appoint guards and nature at his own expense, and this would pro vide an additional form of security against dishonesty. 6. I hope that the above is quite clear, but if there is any point on which you are in doubt please write to me again. If you are quite certain that you follow the system yourself will you please see the Shaikh and on my behalf suggest that he Introduces a system of this sort. It will bring him in a quite considerable income, and should go a long way to remove the grievance of some of the members of the Albu Falasali to the effect that the only man who makes any money out of the Customs is the Persian Director. That particular individual should of course be removed at once. Political Agent, Bahrain.Telegram G.T.C. &lt;£) From Residency Agent, Sharjah. To Political Agent, Bahrain.

The Reform Party replied that they were not prepared to vacate the towers until Shaikh Said demobilized his bedouin recruits and agreed to their demands through the Residency Agent, On September 18th p.m. I proceeded to Dubai and reached there when the Committee had just returned from Daira and been conferring with Shaikh Said. Having acq uainted myself with the situation I called on Shaikh Said and asked him how things were going on . He replied that everything was all right. I tried to extract some inform ation from him, but he declined to disclose anything. X told him that I was aware of the situation, and was very glad to hear that he was trying to settle matters amicably with his relatives. I related &lt;&amp; to him what I knew and he confirmed it. He, further, informed me that the Committee was about to re-cross to Daira to meet the Reform Party. I asked him if I might know his last instructions to them, so that my information might not be one-sided, but he said that when I came to see him he was just interviewing them and had no time to give them any instructions. I knew that he was unwilling to tell me and did not press him further. I re-crossed to Daira. aA 5. In the meantime, besides the letter mentioned in my telegram referred to above, I have receivers letters from the Reform Party, one dated !7t2r^and the other 18th September. Copies, with translations, of the abovemention- ed 3 letters are enclosed herewith. My replies to them were verbal. Before leaving Dairah for Sharjah I left a verbal message to the Reform Party that if they could get a written undertaking in the form of an agreement by Shaikh Said to implement their demands, to be drawn in 2 copies, signed by both sides and attested by all the members of the c ommittee/-7 - 3 Committee, they should accept it and not make my mediation gerated. The fact is that 3 persons of Shaikh Said’s men crossed with their arms to Daira side* They went to the bazaar where they were met by Shaikh Muhammad bin Huraiz* The latter spoke nicely to them and told them that under the circumstances they should have not crossed with their firearms. He advised them to return and they complied. I mentioned this to Shaikh Said when I called on him in the afternoon (18th September). He said that they went that side to get their arms repaired or cleaned and that when he came to know of the incident he reprimand ed the persons responsible. 7. In the course of my conversation with him yesterday I noticed that his attitude was more friendly and mere compromising than it had been on the 17th. Feelings on both sides also were not tense as they had been on that day. Good faith is however lacking on both sides, but the Committee may succeed to reinstate this and bring about a suitable settlement. 8. Before taking leave I assured Shaikh Said that although I did not want to interfere, I was always prepared to render my services if they were required in the settle ment of any differences. an essential condition. 8.

I have to inform you that on Friday night (night preceding Friday) the 21st Rajab (corresponding to the 15th September 1938) Rashid son of Shaikh Said bin Maktum sent men to occupy 'Nahar” tower on which people depend for their water supply. It was on account of the intermediation of the British Government's officials and in reliance on their orders that we acquiesced during the last interval. There is great agitation and therefore you are requested to come early to those who failed to observe the Great Government’s orders.

Shaikh Sultan spent the night at Abu Dhabi and next morning (23rd September) he left for Sharjah which he arrived in the afternoon. Shaikh Saqp Sultan bin Saqr is much pleased with Shaikh Shakhbut and his generous entertainment. According to ’Abdullah bin Paris, Shaikh Sultan’s Secretary, the latter has entered into M ahd al asabah” with the Khawatir section of the Nu’aim, under Ahmad as-S©lf,and with the Bani Ka'b tribe. During his stay at Buraimi Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, assisted by Shaikh Obaid bin Jum’ah of the Bani Ka’b, tried to meet Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Ali, Chief of the Bani Kitab, but the latter avoided him and eventually proceeded to Kalba. Shaikh Sultan’s object of all these alliances is to get his allies’ support against the Bani Kitab, but it is doubtful that they will support him in an offensive against the Bani Kitab; Shaikh Shakhbut may do.

I have just now received your letter of today’s date and thank you for the contents. The Reform Scheme which you desire to carry out, cannot materialize unless you exercise patience, avoid disturbances and use peaceful means. I made this well known to the Party in my verbal answers to their letters, and now confirm it to you in writing. \ Yesterday I received a letter from Shaikh Said, stating that you prevent people from crossing to and fro between Dairah and Dubai after sunset. He asks that people should be allowed to cross until 2 hours after sunset, to facilitate the work of businessmen. I see that his demand is reasonable, and that you can comply with it, without prejudice to the security which you have taken upon yourselves to guard, and for which you are responsible in the present situation.

I asked him if they had any intention to occupy the Customs and Nahar tower. He said that they never thought of occupying the Customs. As regards Nahar tower, he said that Shaikh Said intended to send more men by motor cars that night to the said tower to reinforce its garrison, and that if he did send them, they (the Al Bu Ralasah) would prevent them by force, and would attack the tower itself. I told him thac, I could persuade Shaikh Said not to send any reinforcements to the tower, and warned him not to allow the Al Bu Ralasah take any offensive action.

Residency Agent, SharjahSecret and Personal * British Agency, Respected Sir, On the 27th September Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah called on me and in the course of our talk he mentioned the present situation in ^ubai and said that the A1 Bu Fal&amp;sah have not been able to settle their differences so far, and that one day they may fight on a town which is not their property, which concerned him much. When I asked his explanation, he said that Daira belonged to him and that he could prove his claim by documentsxy evidence. He, then took out of his pocket an oi.d document which he passed toj^ me. The document was dated one century back and ran as follows 'Know you all who see these presents, of Muslim Rulers, Salaams, the Mercy of tiod and His Blessings be upon you, that this town of Daira, which has lately sprung up, has been built by order of Shaikh Multan bin Saqr. It belongs to him and nobody can dispute his ownership of it. Whenever he wants it and lays his claim on it, he will meet no opposition from us. The town will be his town, and the people his people who will support his authority. 'Given by Maktum bin Bati, Jum'ah bin Said, Majid bin Balmuk and Za'al Bin Shahin. Dated 9th Rabi* Awwal 1257.'

Sultan bin Saqr, in whose favour the document was executed, was the present Ruler of Sharjah^ great grand-father. Captain J.B.Howes, Political Agent, Bahrain. 2./-2 . - 2 - Shailsh Sultan went on in his explanations, saying that when the A1 Bu Balah Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (Tuhnun) was murdered, ttie A1 ^u Falasah, who v\rere his secretaries, forged a letter from him to his wali at Dubai, asking him to hand over the town to Maktum bin Bati. The plot succeeded and Maktum and his relatives occupied the town and Maktum was declared Ruler. Later the A1 Bu -Palah new Shaikh of Abu Dhabi wanted to attack Dubai and recover it from the A1 Bu Falasah. He asked the support of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr (the present Ruler's great grand-father). At the same time Maktum's mother came to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr and requested him to support her son, which he did. Consequently Dubai remained in the hands of the Al Ru Falasah, and has since the land of been ruled by them. But/Daira on the eastern shore of , the -subai creek had been and remained the property of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr. When the Al Bu Falasah wanted to build a town on it they had to take Sultan's permission and to give him the document quoted above. 3. Shaikh Sultan (present Ruler of Sharajh) holds another document, dated 1262 A.H. given by the Al Bu Falasah to his great grand-father, Sultan bin Saqr, in respect of Abu Hail which lies east of Mukxi Dairah. He says that ever since that time no claim for Dairah was made by the Shaikhs of Sharjah. He now proposes to claim Dairah and says that if His Majesty's Government will support him in his claim, he will grant them any concessions they wishedvin Dairah. 4 . i pass on the above particulars and the proposal made by shaikh Sultan to you in the hope that they will serve His Majesty's Government's policy towards Dubai in the present situation. I have not given any definite reply to Shaikh Sultan. I only said i would refer/refer the matter to you. Please let me know if Shaikh Sultan should he encouraged. 5 .

As regards parties, undoubtedly my party is stronger than theirs. But I notice that nothing will cause a settlement between us except fighting.

But as you know when an outside person seeks to intervene in other peoples* quarrels, however good his intentions may be, he is likely only to make the quarrel more bitter and perhaps be involved in difficulties and dangers himself. Consequently it is essential that the Rulers of other Shaikhdoms on the Trucial Coast should hold completely aloof from Dubai and should concern them selves solely with their own affairs. I rely on you there fore to understand this friendly message and to avoid interfering in any way in the affairs of Dubai.

C. 3., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Bonoui’able the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre. Subject ?- Disturbances at Dubai. Sir* I have the honour to submit the following report ** s on the recent disturbances at Dubai. 2. It will be remembered that there was a minor upheaval in Dubai in May and June last, which however was composed when the Shaikh was induced to promise administra tive reform in certain directions (vide my memorandum No. C/418-13/2 dated the 26th June 1938). It was believed at that time that the reconciliation then effected between the Shaikh and the dissatisfied sections of the A1 bu Falasah would ensure peaceful conditions in Dubai for some time to come and provide for the gradual introduction of much needed reform in the administration of the State. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that Shaikh Said bin Maktum, a pleasant enough person but incurably weak and incapable of resisting the unwise influence brought to bear on him by certain members of his family, was determined to go back on his undertakings, and had been led to believe that his only hope of security lay in the elimination/-2 - ellmination of the Hashid section of the Albu Palasah. The Shaikh visited Bahrain, where he attempted to enlist the support of His Majesty^ Government against the Awlad Rashid| who, he said, were plotting his destruction 5 and he declined the advice offered to him to strengthen his position in Dubai against agitation in all forms fey initiating reform in the administration. Indeed he went so far as to deny having promised more than the removal of transport monopolies and the consideration at an unspecified date of the possibility of creating a municipal committee for Dubai town. From Bahrain he visited Qatar and Abu Dhabi on various excuses, and in the light of later knowledge it is clear that his object was to enlist support and to collect arms and ammunition for the attack which he had decided to make on the Rashid section of the A1 bu Falasah and their supporters# 3. He arrived back in Dubai in the middle of September and preparations to reduce the Rashid family at once began. Apparently however the situation was not as favourable as he had expected and the Shaikh sent some of his relations to discuss matters with the Rashid family, presumably in the hope of reaching a settlement more favourable from his own point of view than that effected in June# The Rashid family however was growing in strength, and had by then become exasperated; and the sole result of the negotiations was the defection to the 'Reform Party' of practically all those members of theAl bu Falasah who had hitherto supported Shaikh I Said. The latter then s ent his brother Shaikh Juma to Bahrain in a further attempt to enlist official support, and yet another effort was made to borrow arms and ammunition from Qatar. Both attempts failed. The Political Resident, who was/-~ A”'' was then In Bahrain, wrote to Shaikh Said refusing to inter vene in internal affairs in Dubai, advising him to think carefully for the future and suggesting that early and generous reforms might well deprive his opponents of the popular support on which they relied. This letter repeated warnings already given verbally that in the event of fighting in Dubai town the Shaikh would be responsible for the protect ion of British subjects and their property. The Shaikh of Qatar declined to assist on the ground that he could not do so without the express permission of the Political Agent, a somewhat obvious artifice to avoid lending any of his carefully-hoarded arms and ammunition* 4. Shaikh Said however was still far from convinced that he could not overcome the opposition, and the prospect of fighting became more and more imminent. Shots were fired in the air at night near the alighting area used by Imperial Airways flying boats and it became necessary to stop landings in the Dubai creek. Temporary arrangements were made for the refuelling of Imperial Airways flying boats at Has al Khaimah and the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq, was good enough to send a Hoyal Air Force flying boat there to supervise and aid refuelling. Yet another letter was sent to Shaikh Said reminding him of his responsibility for ensuring that no damage was done to the lives and property of British subjects and at the same time the Hashid family were similarly warned* At the request of the Political Resident the Senior Naval Officer sent a sloop to Dubai to ensure the safety of British subjects and if necessary to provide a refuge for them, care being taken to inform all parties at Dubai that this was in fact the sole object of the sloop and that its arrival at Dubai did not in any way indicate that His Majesty 1 s Government/--4- Government intended to support one party or the other* In Duhai itself old cannon were dragged out and mounted, many of the houses were sand-bagged and Bedu reinforcements were hurriedly called in* It should be explained here that the two parties occupied the opposite sides of the creek running through Dubai town, though the Shaikh had also a small party in a tower named Nahar on the Daira side (i.e. the side in occupation of the Bashid family) * This tower was surrounded by the A1 bu Falasah and quickly surrendered* It was not long before the other Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast and Hinterland began to take an active interest in the situation; Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali of the Beni Kitab arrived on the invitation of Shaikh Said, ostensibly as a mediator but more probably to discuss terms for his active support; the petty Shaikh of Bokha in the Buus al Jibal turned up with 50 Shihuh; and on the 10th October Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi also arrived* The last named however appeared genuinely desirous of arranging a settle ment and it waw on his suggestion that a preliminary truce for five days was arranged* The Residency Agent was ins tructed to warn any other Trucial Coast Shaikhs who attempted to interfere that they should hold aloof and concern them selves solely with their own affairs, and it seems this warning did have some small effect. 5. Hitherto it had seemed best to leave matters to take their own course as much as possible in Dubai; for if Shaikh Said bin Maktum genuinely had the support of the majority of the people of Dubai and could crush the opposition, he had every right to proceed as he wished in a purely internal affair. The rapid weakening of the Shaikh’s position/-© t -5- ♦ position, however, the absence of an obvious successor if he were deposed after fighting, and the danger of the conflict spreading along the Trucial Coast led me to believe that it was time to attempt personal mediation. It is unnecessary here to detail the various alliances that have recently been concluded between different Shaikhs and the causes of animosity that exist between the varSious combinations; but I was satisfied in my own mind that if fighting did break out it might be difficult to restrict it, and I had little confidence that the ill-assorted trio of so-called mediating Shaikhs then in Dubsd would be able to effect a reconciliation. The Political Resident approved of my suggestion that I should proceed to Dubai to attempt to mediate and I arrived there in H.M.S. Dept ford on the 16th October. 6 . I found that the Shaikh’s position was even weaker than it had been a few days earlier, that he was much chastened in spirit, and that he was prepared to accept almost any terms that I could obtain for him from the A1 bu Falasah. The latter were now unanimously against him, and on their first visit to me on board H.M.S. Deptford they stated their intention of creating a Council 11 on the lines of that established in Kuwait” to take over all administrative and executive functions, leaving the Shaikh as a mere figure-head. Indeed many of them appeared anxious that Shaikh Said should be deposed at once. I made it clear to them that the relations of is majesty’s Government would be conducted with the Shaikh and not direct with a Council, and in the course of a long discussion with them I suggested that the obvious solution was to provide for an administration conducted by the Shaikh/--6- Shaikh acting in collaboration with a majlis in much the same manner as had prevailed in Dubai only a few years ago. The A1 bu Falasah who, it must be acknowledged, appeared most anxious to avoid any action which might be displeasing to His Majesty^ Government, went ashore to consider this suggestion and undertook to visit me again for a further discussion on the morning of the 18th October. Meanwhile the truce had been extended. On the following morning I visited Shaikh Said ashore and in the course of a long series of platitudes on the subject of government with popular support, I indicated to him this possible solution. I found Shaikh Said had a guard of about one hundred armed men in his house, and this visit gave me an opportunity of seeing the defences erected by both sides. 7. On the following morning, 18th October, the A1 bu Falasah came out to discuss the terms which they proposed to offer Shaikh Said, of which I had obtained a copy the previous evening. During the discussion some alterations were made, and in particular it was decided that to avoid future dispute it would be necessary to fix a p the terms which the A1 bu Falasah finally agreed to, as representing their main objects, is attached to this letter. It will be observed that some of the terms are redundant, but I did not consider it my business to suggest amendments on this score. The main objective had been obtained, namely that the Shaikh was not to be excluded from all share in the administration 5 and while admittedly the new majlis will be more than a purely consultative body, it cannot exercise arbitrary power without reference to the Shaikh unless the latter/- allowance for the Shaikh from Dubai revenues.1 ft\ I y latter declines to attend its meetings; and even then it cannot deal in sole authority with external affairs. 8 . . The gist of these terms was communicated by telegram to the Political Resident for approval and in the afternoon the Shaikh of Dubai visited me to hear them. He was obviously relieved, and, characteristically, concentrated his requests for elucidation on matters affecting his own purse. 9. On the following morning telegraphic instructions were received from the Political Residents to inform the Shaikh in writing that His Majesty^ Government regarded the Shaikh as the head of the State with whom their official relations would continue to be conducted; and that there would be no change in existing arrangements based on Treaty and on long practice under which His Majesty's Government were responsible for the conduct of the foreign relations of Dubai with other Powers and States, and under which they controlled, through the Shaikh, matters affecting those relations or affecting foreigners in Dubai itself. The Political Resident further ordered that a copy of this letter should be sent to the A1 bu Falasah, pointing out that in so far as they were concerned they had in fact already accepted its terms. Arrangements were then made for a final meeting between the two parties in H.M.S. Deptford, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was invited to attend as a witness and to aid in administering the oath of reconciliation. The meeting took place in the afternoon of the 19th October, and after the Shaikh and representatives of the A1 bu Falasah had signed two copies of the terms (and after a request for my countersignature had been evaded), the oath of reconciliation was taken. Letters were handed to both parties in accordance with the Political Resident’s instructions quoted above, and I/--8- I might add here that I received written acceptances from both parties on the following morning of this statement of the relations between His Majesty^ Government and Dubai, 10. That night ,, disarmament f, began and by the following morning cannon were removed and sand bags were being busily emptied into the creek. The first meeting of the majlis was held under the presidency of the Shaikh in the house of Shaikh Mohammad bin Dalmuk, after which Shaikh Said and the members repaired to the Shaikh 1 s own house for coffee and further discussion. Belief in Dubai was general and the belief was stated that there should be no further disturbance to the peace of Dubai for many years to come. V/hether this belief is justified depends, of course, on the Shaikh and the A1 bu Falasah themselves. Both acknowledge that the new Constitution * 1 can be worked successfully, given a genuine desire to do so; and since both parties are, after all, of one blood and did in fact up to a few years ago combine well together, it is not altogether unreasonable to hope that public expectation may be realised. There remains always the dapger of misunderstanding or of hostile feeling fomented by ill-wishers of either party - and there are far too many people on the Trucial Coast whose main purpose in life is to stir up trouble. It is however interesting to note that I was requested to allow the Residency Agent to watch the proceedings of the first few meetings of the majlis, this request originating from Shaikh Said himself; and I have agreed on condition that he shall not take part in any dis cussions whatsoever and shall be merely a witness oi the good faith in which the settlement is carried out. 11. It is pleasant to be able to report on this occasion that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi acted well. I have little doubt, from reports received, that but for his intervention there would/-would have been an outbreak of fighting, and once fighting had begun a simple settlement of this kind would have been difficult to reach♦ The Shaikh of the Beni Kitab took no active part in mediation and disappeared from Dubai on the day I arrived there in spite of a polite invitation to » visit me* 12* In concluding this report I beg leave to pay tribute to the very prompt and valuable co-operation offered by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, in sending first H.BJ.S* Powey and afterwards H.M.S. Deptford to Dubai* I was enabled to proceed to Dubai in H*M.S. Deptford and the fact that negotiations were conducted on board one of His Majesty’s sloops unquestionably contributed greatly to their successful outcome* Commander Stanfield, his officers and his whole Ship’s Company bore most cheerfully the considerable inconvenience to which they must have been put by my frequent visitors, and X am deeply indebted to them for their invariable kindness and consideration towards I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain8/- AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SHAIKH OF DUBAI AND MEMBERS OF THE ALBU FALASAH 0 O 0 1* A Majlis shall be founded at once in the State of Dubai to be formed of members of the Albu Falasah and other subjects of Dubai.

British Agency, Sharjah, 24th March 1939o To, The Political Agent, Bahrain. V Iviemorandum I te^ to x eport the -following for your information.-- -he last troubles in Kuwait have had reaction on the situation in Dubai. The people of Dubai b^gan to criticise the Majlis and its members. They say that the Majlis had done nothing in the interest of the public and instead of bringing good, it had been an ill omen. One, Hamad bin Majid a notable of Daira asked the Majlis to dismiss certain employees on the ground that they drink liquor and do not pray and as such should be turned out from the service. Shaikh Hashar bin Rashid sent for him and threatened him, but he said that he was not afraid and that had it not been for him they woula not' have reached -their present position. Shaikh Mani f v/as called by telegram from Bombay and he arrived by airmail on 19th March. Hamad bin Majid bin Futaim of the Has Quarters at ^aira continued to talk against the Majlis. As soon as Shaikh Mani ’ arrived he went to him ana tried to please him but was not successful. He told Shaikh Mani* that he could not listen to him unless the director of customs, Rashid bin Bati who is the nephew of Shaikh Mani* and some of the Customs employees and members of the Majlis were turned out. Shaikh Mani* said that was not possible without any cause. This morning he was joined by the guards,who are employed by the Majlis for the bazay,who promised to help Hamad if he used arms against the members of the Majlis.Hamad is also joined by some other notables. The Marar are also reported to be against the Majlis and have taken oath that they would help Shaikh Sa'id against the Majlis if he wants to abcMlish it. The Sudan are also rex&gt;orted to be on the side of Shaikh Sadid.Since the formation of the Majlis, Shaikh Sa'id adopted a lenient policy with the Bani Yas in general where as his son Kashid and wife Refrained from interfering in the affairs of the State. By means of this policy many of the Bani Yas began to sympathy with him and he managed to win their favour. 2. Shaikh Hash id bin Sa'id wants to marry the daughter of Ramadan bin Raid, the late uncle of Shaikh shakhbut of Abu Dhabi. The mother of the girl is from the Marar who are living at Da ira. The Shaikh wants to have one mnnth marraige show, namely 15 days at Dubai side and 15 days at baira. They finished Dubai ana started their marriage play at Daira two days ago. The members of the Majlis are very much afraid that the Shaikh might take this as means of capturing Daira and abolishing the Majlis. The reason is that many people cross from Dubai side with their rifles to attend the show and the Shaikh’s launches take them to and fro free from any charge.

Memorandum In continuation of my memorandum No.C/217-3/1 dated the 24th March 1939, I beg to report the following further information about the state of affairs in Dubai:- It has been discovered that Hamad bin Futaim was orignally instigated by two members of the Majlis, Shaikh Suhail bin Bati(cousin and son-in-law of Shaikh Mani') and Rashid bin Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Dalmuk and also .Shaikh Sa’id bin Bati. Shaikh Sa’id bin Bati left the town and made a camp for himslef in the desert. The members of the Majlis were asked to explain about, their behaviour and they admitted that they had instigated Hamad bin Futaim. In a meeting held last nignt Shaikh Suhail bin Bati insisted that the demand of Hamad bin Futaim about the dismissal of certain employees should be acceded to. shaikh Nani* opposed his suggestion as a result he walked ©ut from the Majlis with anger end did not attend again* i 3* Today the Marar tribe told their Chief, Shaikh Uujrin bin Sultan, a member of the Majlis, that he should resign from the Majlis and act under the order of Shaikh Sa’id failing which they were going to depose him and elect another Shaikh. He promised to comply with their wishes* The members of the Majlis have put extra guards in the Bari Nahar(tower) and took possession of two Murabba'as(posts) at Saiiaand kept armed men in them. These were also supplied with food applies ana rater to guard against sudden attack* Shaikh Sa’id sendi ^£ word to the Majlis that their action was contrary to thd^agree ment signed by them in the presence of the Political ivgent anu breach of their oath.

On the night of 25th March, -Shaikh Mani* sent me a letter dfted 3rd Safr 1358 in which he accuses Shaikh 3a 1 id of intrigues. On 26th I went to Dubai. Shaikh Mani», Muhammad bin Huraiz and Rashid bin Huraiz came to see me. They said that Shaikh Sa‘id had been giving presents to the people and eticing them by various means ana getting promise from them that they would be under his orders. This, they said, explains to them he the bad intentions whicn/hab in his mind and although he dici not say to any one that he had bad intention against the members, the large number of men crossing every day for the marriage that ceremony leads them to believe/he wants to do harm to them for which reason they have taken precautionary measures to ensure their safety. They requested me to speak to Shaikh 3a‘id and prevent him from his activities. 5. I replied that as I had previously said to them and to Shaikh Sa’id, I was not prepared to interfere in their own internal affairs which they should settle among themselves. I also confirmed this in my reply to Shaikh Irani 1 No.218 dated the 26th March 1939.

If Shaikh Sa’id is assisted by the Marar, the Sudan and the people of the Has who are lead by Hamad bin Futaim, the Awlad Rashid have only about 50 men with them® 7.

Everything is now quiet in Dubai and Dira and both twons are in the hands of Shaikh Sa ! id. No British subjects have been killed nor has their property bet n damaged. Shaikh Meni end 5 other ex-members of the i-viajlis have escaped from Dira to Sharjah, where they are sheltering with about one hundred armed followers. The remaining members of the Majlis have thrown in their lot with Shaikh Sa T id, who has still about 400 men under arms, after having paid off his bedouin supporters this morning. The problem now is what is Mani f s party going to do ? Shaikh Sa*id will pardon followers, but will not repeat not allow his 6 relatives to return to Dubai and is anxious that they should settle further than Sharjah, to avoid local intrigue. Shaikh Sa T id is asking Sharjah to be responsible for the refugees or to turn them out in accordance with tribal custom. Residency Agent considers Shaikh of Sharjah will temporize by saying 'Mani is waiting the Political Agent, Bahrain’s reply to his appeal to H.M.G. to uphold last Octobers Agreement. Residency/_ 9 Residency Agent feels inevitable refusal of this appeal will make Mani and his companions desperate and is therefore anxious that arrangements for M ani f s future be settled before refusal is communicated to him. In the meantime propose Residency Agent inform Shaikh of Sharjah that we will hold him responsible for any loss of British lives or property caused by refugees while they are sheltering in Sharjah and warn the Shaikh of Bharjah against any action that might lead to fighting in Bharjah that would effect British interests. Presence of sloop appears desirable until future of Mani and other 5 relatives has been settled, as both Shaikh Sa T id and Residency Agent fear some desperate action. - H.M.S.

Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain To The Honourable the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf Bushire Sir I have the honour to submit the following report on the disturbances which broke out at Dubai at the end of March 1939 2. In your letter No. 569-S dated the 8 th November 1938 you reported to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India the events which led to the formation of an Executive Council in Dubai last October and enclosed a copy of the terms of agreement drawn up between the Shaikh of Dubai and his relatione of the A1 Bu Falasah family. At the conclusion of the nego tiations which at that time I conducted between the two parties I had attempted to impress upon both the essential need to keep before them the ideal of close co-operation for the benefit of the State, to eliminate mistrust and for the members of the Council to avoid at all costs arousing public suspicion that they or any section of them were actuated by purely selfish motives. For a time all went well. The Customs, on which the prosperity of Dubai depends, were reorganised on more efficient lines and the Persian Director and employees who had previously diverted much of the Customs collections to their own pockets were removed; Town watchmen were appointed/-- 2 - appointed; three small schools were opened; and an effort, primitive though it might be, was made to introduce sanitation. The effort however rapidly exhausted itself. The Council paid little heed to the Shaikh whose attendances at their meetings became infrequent; *the Bashid family tended to monopolise patronage and sharply rejected criticism; in place of a Bala- diyah or Municipal Committee, on the need for which the A1 Bu Falasah had previdusly laid so much stress, a single individual was nominated by a section of the Council, and this man appa rently regarded his appointment as a licence to evict shop- and stall-holders and to cause the maximum possible inconve nience to the public; persons of importance who had supported the A1 Bu Falasah were ignored - or to b e more explicit, did not receive the expected rewards for their support; and gradual ly the feeling spread that for one despot there had merely been substituted a board of despotism. Meanwhile one import ant tribe in Daira was estranged by the arbitrary appointment of a new and unpopular headman, and another by a particularly disgraceful affair in which one of their women was involved with a member of the Council; and quarrels broke out among the members themselves. Shaikh Said staged an admirable exhibition (from the Arab point of view) of dignity in adversity, his evil genii in the shape of his wife and his eldest son retired into the background, and the natural forces of reaction came into full play, The Bedu in their hundreds offered him their aid, and all that was wanting was an opportu nity, This came with the marriage of his son to a girl of the Marar, a tribe in Daira, Part of the marriage celebra tions were conducted in the Marar quarter of Daira and, as is usual on such occasions, hundreds of people attended and there was much firing of rifles in the air. The Rashid family and their/-3- their supporters recognised the danger, and occupied some of the Daira towers and block houses with armed men. According to local sentiment this was an act of hostility and at once relieved the Shaikh of his oath of reconciliation and amity (which concluded last Octobers negotiations). On the evening of the 29th March when the Shaikh’s party crossed to Daira for the daily celebrations the signal was given, and in a few minutes the whole of Daira, with the exception of one fort, one block house and two houses, fell into his hands. Shaikh Hashar bin Rashid and his son were killed, almost half the members of the Council surrendered, and though sniping con tinued till the evening of the 30th March the remaining members of the Council then fled to Sharjah, being joined there by one of their number who had raised a few Bedu from the desert. The inefficiency which permitted their escape is typical, as is the fact that most of the casualties (variously estimated from 16 to 26) occurred amongst unarmed slaves and dependants. 3. Up to this time reports received in Bahrain had led me to believe that, with Shaikh Said’s victory so complete, the refugee members of the Council had been rendered innocuous. The prohibition which had been imposed on Imperial Airways alighting in Dubai creek was removed, and I prepared to proceed to Dubai with the simple object of obviating over-violent reaction on the Shaikh’s part and inducing him to appoint an Advisory Council. On the 1st April, however, H.M.S. Deptford, which had proceeded to Dubai for the protection of British subjects, reported that Shaikh Mana bin Rashid and the five ex-members of the Council who had fled with him^were support ad by 100 armed followers and that, when the appeal which they had addressed to me for active British intervention on their behalf against Shaikh Said was refused (as it must inevitably be)/-■4- be) they might embark on some desparate action endangering British interests, I therefore flew to Dubai at once. Appre ciation of the situation on the spot made it clear that the following main objectives must be sought j- (i) The immediate appointment of an Advisory Council, and such other public bodies as I could induce Shaikh Said to agree to, in order to offset reactionary influences either on the part of the Shaikh who might revert to irres ponsible despotism, or on the part of the public who might turn against him once more on little provocation — on the theory of the swing of the pendulum, the (ii; To open the way for reconciliation between/Shaikh and some at least of the refugee ex-Members, and to find a bait to lure the rest from desperate impulses; and (iii) to find a means of ensuring the departure of the irreconcilables from Sharjah as soon as possible, and meanwhile to render their temporary stay there innocuous, (It must be remembered that Arab custom makes it impossible for the Shaikh of Sharjah to turn them out forcibly and that, custom or no custom, I could give no order to the Shaikh of Sharjah in this respect), 4, Shaikh Said, his brother Shaikh JUma and his son Shaikh Rashid were inclined to be a little self-satisfied when I first saw them, but were quickly deflated by a very blunt recital of past history. I did not press the Shaikh to permit the refugee ex-members to return (though it became evident that sooner or later some of them would be admitted) but concentrated on the question of an Advisory Council, and on the restoration -- under reasonable conditions — of the property of the refugees. This first interview was brought to a close on his acceptance in principle of the Advisory Council, and his promise to restore property on the refugees departing /--5- departing for some distant Shaikhdom and giving guarantee of non-aggression. 5. On the following day the Shaikh was induced to summon a Majlis at which he would announce the appointment of this Advisory Council, and a further step was then taken in obtain ing his agreement to the formation of a Majlis-al-fejara, the need for which in Dubai has long been apparent. . I then proceeded to Sharjah and saw Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, from whom I demanded a letter addressed to Shaikh Said, acknowledg ing his full responsibility for controlling Shaikh Mana and his adherents while they remain in Sharjah. He attempted to evade compliance but, after receiving an undertaking for peace ful behaviour from the refugees, he later wrote the required letter. Both at this interview and again on the following day I impressed upon him the fact that his responsibility is absolute, and reminded him that while custom might prevent him from driving out the refugees, it was by no means difficult to 'induce' them to leave. I then had a long interview with Shaikh Mana. He and his supporters apparently believed that His Majesty 1 s Government would afford them armed assistance to 'punish' Shaikh Said *. I disabused him of this idea, but took some trouble to soothe him, infonning him of Shaikh Said^ promise of restoration of property and the grant of allowances to those refugees who, like Shaikh Maktum bin Rashid, have few resources» on the conditions stated above. It was not to be expected that they would leave Sharjah at once, but the lure of restored property etc, coupled with the discomfort of Sharjah, will, I hope, result in their departing in the near future. Meanwhile their followers have already begun to return to Dubai under a promise of pardon and I anticipate that the refugee party will very shortly be reduced to their own uereons and /-■ I and their private servants or slaves* It would be foolish to exclude the remote possibility of an attempt to murder Shaikh Said or one of his family in revenge for Shaikh Hashar* s death — and they are taking careful precautions to prevent it — but I do not apprehend the renewal of organised disturbance. &gt;1 6 . As reported in my telegram No. 103 D dated the 4th April 1939 the new Advisory Council in Dubai was appointed that morning. It is to function on traditional Arab lines, and I shall use my best endeavours to ensure that it does not fall into disuse. In point of fact , while over-optimism would be misplaced, I believe Shaikh Said and his family at last realise the need for maintaining close touch with popular feeling and for associating the leaders of resident tribes and communities with his day-to-day administration. It is a matter of interest that five members of the defunct Executive Council have been appointed to the new Majlis. The selection of members for the Majlis-al-Tejara has also, I think, been wisely done; and I now have his promise to proceed without unnecessary delay to the formation of a Baladiyah. He has further promised to continue the improve ments made in the Customs Department and in no circumstances to reappoint the Persian^who brought it iiato such disrepute. The schools are to continue and sanitation is &amp;o oe improved; he promises to construct a good building for a hospital as soon as the new Medical Officer for the Trucial Coast arrives and can advise him about plans; and finally I extracted from him an undertaking to discuss with the Majlis-al-Tejara effi cient arrangements for the whole conduct of the Dubai pearling, so haphazard and uneconomic in the past. 7. As the Shaikh of Dubai has experienced only recently the results of ignoring advice, it is by no means inconceivable that/--7- @) that some, if not all, of these promises may be carried out. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, 1 k. Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential No.C/231-3/1. British Agency, Shai* jeh, 8th npril 1939. To, The Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum. The affairs in Dubai are calm and quiet and the people are carrying on their business as usualo 2. In spite of the advice given to him the Shaikh of Sharjah encouraged Shaikh Mani f and his x^arty to live in Sharjah He also informed Shaikh Llani of all the talk which took place between him and the Political Agent and suggested to him that there had been many instcoices before whereby refuges were allowed to live wherever they liked while their properties were returned to them. This morning the Shaikh of Sharjah sent me -V'j'if the attached(in original) letter No.4 dated the 16th Safar 1358 (i.e.Vth April 1939) to the effect that Shaikh Mani* and his party have become his subjects. Later Shaikh Mani f came to me and requested me to ask the Shaikh of Dubai to return their properties and fix their allowances in accordances with his promise to the Political Agent. I said to Shaikh Mani 1 that the Shaikh of Dubai made the above promise on condition that they should live in a place other than Sharjah and for that reason I could not see my way to speak to the Shaikh about their properties etc. Shaikh Lani‘ said ‘that according to the custom on the Trucial Coast they had the right to live whereever they liked. I said that if they wanted to live in Sharjah, then, according to the custom on the Trucial Coast, the question about tks their properties etc, lies with the Shaikh of Sharjah to settle with the Shaikh of Dubai. That if they wanted to get the benefit of the promise given to the Political Agent they should try /try and find some other place to avoid contact with Dubai and prevent further troublev Shaikh Mani 1 and the rest said that they did not rely on the Shaikh of Sharjah but on the help of the High British Government. That they would give an undertaking to preserve peace and in no way act against the wishes of the High Government or their Representatives. They said that no other place on the True ia 1 Coast would be suitable for them as they have sailing boats and most of their sailors live in Dubaio Besides, Dubai is a pearl centreand living near it is of great importance to them. They added that from the social and living point of view it would be alos difficult for their families to live at other than Sharjah and requested the good offices of the High British Government to live at Sharjah and get their properties etc, for them. 3. As an alternative, Shaikh Rani 1 , nwlad Bati and the Huraizat suggested that they become Rafiqs(subjects) of Shaikh Muhammad bin *Ali of the Bani Qitab tribe whereas their families become JIRAN( neighbours or residents) either at Sharjah or Hira which-ever place is approved by the Political Agent.The male persons live out in the desert and come to Sharjah or Hira during the dicing season to attend to the pearl trade. 4. If neithBr of these is approved, Shaikh Mani* himself said he could not think of a more suitable place than Bahrain to live in provided the Shaikh of Dubai gives them allowances to enable them to live outside* 5. The Shaikh of Dubai warned the Shailch of Sharjah that if he allowed them to live in Sharjah he would swop his motor cars and would think of more effective measures. The Shaikh of Shfrjah asked time till 9th April to consider the matter. 6. The Shaikh of Sharjah is so much afraid that he demoliijed all upper rooms of his subjects within a radius of shout 400 yards from his palace so that they may now be used by an enemy capturing Sharjah.

Please speak to the Shaikh of Sharjah as follows That I have now heard that in spite of all I said to him he has encouraged Shaikh Mana* and his party to remain in Sharjah; that I trust he has not forgotten his responsibi lity which in no circumstances can he evade; and that so long as the party remains at Sharjah it is incumbent on him as Shaikh to take every precaution, however difficult it may be, to prevent any occurrence, particularly one which might, even remotely, endanger the lives and property of British subjects. 3. Please also remind Shaikh Mana* verbally from me that I told him that restoration of property and the grant of allowances by the Shaikh of Dubai for those who are in need depends on their going to live in some distant Sheikhdom; that I shall not ask the Shaikh of Dubai to go beyond this promise; and (unless you see any objection,/ that I do not really expect that Shaikh Said will keep this ofier open for ever.

The authorisation to them I will consider giving on receipt of your reports. Re Sloops . L ( a ) You can in 0X1 emergency, where time does not permit of applying to me, ask for a sloop direct from the Senior Naval Officer, when once a sloop has been asked for, however, the intimation that it is no longer needed must come from me, as in the present instance, though in coming to a decision on this Point I take your views into consideration. (b) It is one of the normal duties of His Majesty’s Navy to safeguard British lives and property in seaport towns all over the world. When therefore we ask them to proceed to Bibai or anywhere else where there happens to be trouble we are merely asking them to carry out their normal duties. In point of fact we ask for sloops for this purpose very seldom, normally not more than two or three times a year. If there is trouble at an Arab Port, and a sloop is not asked for, and British lives or property are endangered, still more so if lives are actually lost and property damaged, we look very foolish.

I hope you will not think it improper of me if T ask if you would be willing to reconsider your orders about authorising Imperial Airways to re-use Dubai after a stoppage caused by trouble in that Sheikhdom. &amp;y reason for asking this is that the use of Pas al Khsimah under present conditions really is extremely inconvenient for Imperial Airways and rather than use it they^eut their pay load in order to fly direct between Jiunri and Bahrain. Telegraphic communication to and from Bushire is so much delayed in these days that it may be anything between 24 and 48 hours from the time when I telegraph the ’’all clear” to you till your authorisation reaches the various Imperial Airways 1 stations concerned. If I am myself on the spot I am in a good position to assess the situation and to take the responsi bility, as I did last October and recently, of reopening Dubai to Imperial Airways. 3.

Owing to the pressure brought to bear on the Shaikh of Sharjah by Shaikh Sa’id, Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, decided to ■ refuse permission for Shaikh Mani 1 and his party to live in Sharjah. Just before I received your above referred to memorand um, Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr sent me a letter No.5 dated uhe 20th Safar 1358(i*e. 10th April 1939) which is $ r Is enclosed in / original and translation cancelling his previous letter No.4 about them® 3. I spoke to the Shaikh of Sharjah in accordance with your instructions. He replied what he could not go against the Arab custom and refuse them permission to stay in Sharjah. As their presence was going to lead to trouble, he said that he preferred they should find some other place. 4. In compliance with your orders in paragraph 3 I also reminded Shaikh Liani 1 verbally. After conferring with each other Shaikh lUani’ and his party decided yesterday evening to live in Ajman. In view of Shaikh of Dubai's past remarks to ydu about Ajman . I at once asked his opinion verbally about their stay in that Sheikhdom. The Shaikh said that he was anxious that they should leave Sharjah as soon as possible. That although he preferred that they should live at a far distant place, he had no objection to their stay in Ajman if the Shaikh of Ajman would hold himself responsible for them in accordance with the usual Arab custom observed on the Trucial Coast. Shaikh Mani 1 and his cosuins left for Ajman early this morning in order to cjet the usual letters to the Shaikh of Dubai. About their stay -in Ajman^the Shaikh of Dubai has not the same strong objection as foi aharjah* .^x^ey qo nou want to live in Has al Khaimah or Abu Dhabi. As for Urn al ^aiwain they say that it has no fresh water and they cannot also live there* The Shaikh of Dubai does not want Shaikhs, Mani* , Maktum, Suliail bin Bati, and Sa’id bin Bati to live in Sharjah but does not mind about the rest. He even agreed to allow Shaikh Kashid bin Bati, nephew of hani' (ex-director of Customs) to remain in Sheerjah if he wished to do so. In my opinion that their stay in the desert even at a distant pla.ee is more dangerous than their stay in Ajman and the Shaikh of Dubai agrees with me on this pojnt* Personally, I am strongly against their stay with the Bani Qitab lest Shaikh Mani f might make things more difficult about oil matters. Shaikh Mani* said to me yesterday that he contem plates to go to Bahrain on a visit. He is also doubtful if the Shaikh of Ajman would allow them to stay in his country being afraid of Shaikh Sa f id and Government. 5. If Shaikh Sa 1 id accepts the undertaking by Ajman be it.would/better for all concerned to get their properties and settle with chtir families than hang in the balance and every now and then trouble me in spite of being told several times that nothing could be done beyond what they had been promised subject to their living at a distant place. 6.

Besides these they have 32 men, sailors and ordinary followers who are after food your only. I am complying with/orders about feeding arrangements. 7. On 6th April, Shaikh Sa ’ id summoned all the members of the Majlis at-Tut^Ljarah and informed them about their functions. He temporary fixed his buidiing which he intends to provide for the Post Office for their weekly meetings on each Thursday. On 8th April, the Shaikh also issued a notice to the public about Majlis at-Tuj&amp;ra, copy of which is enclosedTranslation of letter Ho. 5 dated the 2tth Safar 1358(i.e. loth April 1939) from :lhaikh Sultan bin daqr, Ruler of Shariah to the Residency Agent,Sharjah. 16th Safar 1358 and those connected with him.

It seems to me that both parties are trying to create as many difficulties as they possibly can. Shaikh Mana f and his companions knew at the beginning that Shaikh Sa*id wanted them to go and live in either Abu Dhabi or Has al Khaimah; they tried to stay in Sharjah and when they found that that was difficult they tried to go to Ajman or Umm al °aiwain, i.e. anywhere except the two places where they could go. If in the meanwhile Shaikh Sa'id has been making efforts to prevent other Shaikhs allowing them to stay in their countries they really only have themselves to blame. I presume, but please confirm this, that they are r^w making overtures to either Abu Dhabi or Has al IChaimah. If so there would be no harm in telling Shaikh Sa f id verbally that it would be very foolish of him to try to prevent them settling in either of these two places. 3. Even if they cannot fix themselves up in Has al Khaiiiiah. or Abu Dhabi, there are still plenty of places up and down the Gulf between Muscat and Kuwait where they can go, so there is no need for us to interfere at present. I would certainly like to get the question settled as soon as possible but we can only help by trying to induce both sides to see where their best advantage lies.- 2 - 4. Meanwhile, so long as they remain at Sharjah, the Shaikh of Sharjah is still responsible for them and he must understand that he cannot evade his responsibility merely by writing letters like his No J 5 dated the 20th Safar 1358 in which he states that he is no longer responsible. It is entirely his own fault that he has got himself into this difficulty and I hope it will serve as a lesson to him to listen to advice in future which is given for his own benefit. / /VU Political Agent, Bahrain.n k c.o.

He was accompanied by his brother ’Ali, cousin ’Abdullah bin 3a’id and tv/o of his notables. After coffee Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid spoke to me privately. He said that Shaikh Mani’ and his party went to him and asked him to live in Um al Qeiwain. That from their outer behaviour and with the desire of keeping friendly with the Shaikh of Dubai he did not like them to live in his country. That Shaikh Mani Hu and his party pressed him for a letter to Shaikh but he did not promise to give them one and said that he wanted to(a) ascertain the opinion of the High British Government and (b) to discuss the matter with the Shaikh of Dubai first* I said to Shaikh Ahmad that the matter was between him and Shaikh Da’id and had nothing to do with us and that he was at liberty to do what he thought best. Shaikh Ahmad said that in all doubtful cases he wished to be guided by the good advice of the High British Government with whom he always wants to be on strong friendly relations. X thanked him for ali that he had said. Ghaikh Ahmad secretly sent men to all the Trucial Shaikhdoms to carry out propaganda foigaiid indirectly poison the mind ox che rest of the Trucial .Shaikhs against Mani’ party.

That what is much more important, Mani* has modem ideas and would thus cauise the poeple of the place in which he would live to rise against their respective Shaikh for reforms. Owing to the above, I saw the Shaikh of Dubai on the night of 14th before Shaikh Ahmad bin ^ashid could see him and told him that it would not be in his interest to carry out such propaganda and prevent Mani* Party from finding place to live in other than Sharjah. I advised him to stop this in his own interest. Shaikh Sa f id denied and promised to do his best to to get kani' Party to live in Urn al Qaiwain^the Shaikh of which place he said to me / that he trusted more than any other Ghafari Shaikh. 4.

Shaikh Ahmad bin Kashid, as an excuse, asked Shaikh 3a 1 id to give him a written document that he would not be held responsible for their activities. Shaikh Sa’id said that was not in accordance with the usual custom and thus he could not give it.

In my letter $ 0 , 669 - 8 , dated tne Btn November 1938, I reported the events which led to the formation of an hcecutive Council in Dibai last October and enclosed a copy of the Agre _ awn up between tne ShaiJch of Dibai on the one hand, and the leaders of the opposition party, the Shaikh's relatione of the Rashid family, head of tne Al Bu falasan tribe,on the other, if or a time all went well and tne new council busied itself with certain badly needed local reforms in tne direction of tne organ!sation of tne Customs, law and order - town watchmen were appointed, and Mueatlon - 3 email schools were opened. An attempt was even made to institute sanitation, 3. The effort at reform, however, rapidly exhausted itself, ^he Council paid little heed to the Shaikh whose attendance at their meetings became infrequent, and the nashid Jf&amp;mily tended 2to monopolise patronage. In place of a Haladiyan or a&amp;unicipal Coi»aittee, on the need for whicn tne Al hu ^alasah nad previous ly laid so much stress* a single individual was nominated by the Council. Discontent began to show itself and gradually a feel ing spread that for one despot there had merely been substituted a board of despotism. 4. Ilattera came to a head on the 29th ha'ch on the occasion of the marriage of the ohaiJch*a son to a Bedouin girl. i’he Bedouin of the Dibai hinterland had already promised the fj their support, and had crowded into tne town for the marriage ceremony. The signal was given, the Bedouin and other sympath isers with the Shaikh took action, and in a few minutes the whole of the Bairs, quarter of the town was in tne Shaikh's hands. There was little actual fighting but Ohalkh Haenar bin Kashid and nis son were killed. About naif of tne members of the Council surrendered, while the remainder under BnaiKh Man a fled to Char j ah with about 100 followers to take refuge had made a request that the Senior NaV&amp;X Officer, Persian Ouif, would be good enough to send a sloop to liibai to protect and British lives and property $ Oeptford arrived at Difcai on the 1st April, which had a steadying effect on the town. Mr. nightman flew to Dibai on tne 2nd April, where he proceed ed in communication with me to clear up tne situation. 6. one of tne main objectives was the appointment by tne Shaikh of a nominated Advisory Council, wnieh would form a convenient half-way house between the old autocratic rule of there. In ay telegram No. 188 , dated the 50th marcn 1959, Ithe Shaikh, which had been unpopular wi th the ms 3 of the people, and the abortive elected executive Council, This the Shaikh agreed to after nir. /eightman nad pointed out the advisability of this step. A Mej lia-al-Tejara (Comraittee of merchants) for settling coraraercial disputes -.vas also formed, 7. The other objective was to deal with the refugees in Sharjah. Ur* veightman impressed on the cn&amp;iich of anarjah the latter*s responsibility for controlling tne refugees while they were in his town, and after some hesitation the jn&amp;ixn acknowledged his responsibility in this respect in writing. According to Arab custom it was impossible for the ynaikn of Sharjah to eject forcibly these refugees, wno had sought his protection, finally tne following arrangement was come to between tne Shaikhs of Dibai and Sharjah, and Shaikh Mrna, tne principal leader of tne refugees, through Mr. '.’eightman’s mediation. The leaders of tn© refugees would leave Sharjah shortly for a more distant Sheikhdom, Sharjah be trig only some 8 miles from Dibai was too near from tne Shaikh of sibai* s point of view. hen theee leaders had left aharjah and nad given guarantees of non-aggress ion their property, which nad been confiscated by the shaikh, would be restored, mt. 'feightraan stated in his report that he thought this emigration would probably take place shortly. Meanwhile the followers of the refugee leaders have already begun to return to libai under a promise of pardon from tne Shaikh. d. Mr. /eightman is of the opinion that the Shaikh or libai and his family have at last realised the need for maintaining close touch with popular feeling, and it Is a / point«■ point of some inter sat that 5 members of tae old Council have been nominated to the ne^r one. 1‘he Shaiich naa also proaiaed Mr. /ei^tman to form a Municipality and to continue the improvement a started by tne old council. 9. The parallel between the popular movements in Kuwait and nibai ia interesting. In each case, after popular dis content had shown itself, Mia Majesty*e Government advised the shaikh to associate hia people iri fch himeelf in the administration of hie State by the nomination of an Advisory Council, which would be according to the grab traditions of government. In each case the Shaikh did not take this advice, and as a result of tne increase in strength in the popular movement an elected Executive council was imposed on tne Shaikh, which deprived him of much of his power. In each case this Council grew unpopular and aided by his sympathisers , which included the Bedouin of the hinterland, the upset the Council. In each case also the ;ihaikh, this time taking the advice given to him, appointed a nominated Advisory Council. It would of course have saved muon trouble both at fuwait and )ibai if our advice had been taken in the first instance. But people normally only learn by their mietakes, and we can nope that the two Shaikhs concerned nave profited by tneir lesson. 10. in conclusion I should like to express my appreciation of the services of Mr. height man who, as on the previous occasion when he visited hibal in connection with the last disturbances, acted as a successful mediator between the various parties concerned. I should like also to express my / appreciationappreciation of the co-operation of the r qyal &gt;*avyi as I n&amp;ve pointed out above the presence of Jeptford at Jibai nad a steadyIht; effect on the situation, » I an sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary to the (Jovernment of India in the External Affairs Department, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and the political Agent, Bahrain, I have the honour to be, Dir, Your moat obedient numble servant, sd, T.C.Fowleo Political Heaident in trie Persian dull*. ♦ sent under printed letter **o*367-s of tne 20th April, 1939,confidential.

After long talk with the Shaikh of Dubai in which the Secretary tried to convince the that with effect from 18th May all traffic between Sharjah and Dubai would be stopped and no Sharjah or Dubai subjects would be allowed wo go to or come from Sharjah. The Shaikh of Dubai said that Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr had taken dis advantage of the situation and had been carrying various propaganda and intrigues against Dubai to which may be added the help which the party are now getting from the .Shaikh of Sharjah. That as long as marriage arrangements are being made for the members of the party there does not seem to be any likelihood of the party leaving Sharjah. In order to eheek these intrigues the above order of prohibition would remain in force until Mani' and his party find a place to live in* 3.

'L,V V bin Rasnid After compliments, I beg to inform you that on the nay on which the incident took place at Lubai when we were attacked by Bedouins ana criminals with the sons of Sa’ia ana Jum'ah bin Maktoom in a treacherous ana muraerous manner at Lerah whitest we were unaware and feeling secure by relaying on the agreement which was drawn on the Man CM war through the mediation of the Political Agent when you were present with him, they took possession of all the higher houses and forced all the men (to leave?) they have killed those who were in office and killed pedestrians in tne bazars ana streets^then we immediately took up arms and although we were a few persons we fought for our lives. The attack was made at 10 01clock (about 4.15 p.m.) on the 7th of Safar 1358 ana we immediately sent our son Rasnid bin Man’a ana brother Sa f id bin Rumaid in a car to Sharjah and they reached you at 10.30 (about 4.45 p.m.) and they nave informed you of what has happened^and tsre'y asked you to come with them to us and to make the necessary arrangements for putting down the incident^but we regret that you nave refused to do so but instead you were frequently going to and coming from Sa T id bin Maktoom, and you did not come to us while’s we were defending our lives and requesting you to come to us, (evei) some unarmed persons were frequently visiting us with news and you refuse to come to us. On 8th Safar at 6 O’clock ( about 12.15 p.m.) we have sent a letter to you in which we have informed you of the condition in which we &lt; were and of our Op&amp;u* cC^-a(. expectation that you will come but/not come to us and did not nd to us any body at all so that we even remained in that ecarious condition for 3-J ,f Awdah’ f (12 hourly divisions oi the y and night, i.e. for 42 hours) and at the later part oi tne ‘hit we escaped. On the morning of 9th Safar at 2 O’clock able (about 8.15 a.m.) we.came to tne Agency at Sharjah with e sons of Snaikh But! bin Suhail and most of the notables of -Abu-Filas and their followers. You nave informed us about- 2 - XL 'V tne expeclea arrival of the Political Agent ana we waited until rlis excellency arrived then we had aiscussions with him about tne ill-omenea incidentwanted to describe to him the whole matter since tne foundation ol tne Majlis upto tne time of our meeting witn nim^but^unfortunately for us^he had some work in Bahrain ana we were unable to describe that matter to him as it was. He, may G-od bless him, has promised us^for the return of our available and missing properties and^he will pay us sufficient salaries, you have repeatedly and. on many, occasions made declarations about the same, you have then ordered us to accompany Shaikh oultan bin Sagur and we immediately accompanied him, but when his letter (Shaikh Sa f id T s ?) reached you, you nave forbidden us from doing tne same and ordered^us to accompany one of the Rulers of tne Eastern coast,we nave obayea your orders and went to Shaikh Sultan bin Humaid, the Ruler of f .djman and we visited Snaikn Ahmed bin Rashid of f Um-el-Qiwin and asio visited Snaikn Sultan bin Salem, the nuler of Ras-el- Knaimah out through the intrigues of Sa T id bin Maktoom and his supporters, those who have their own personal designs ana whose sole objects is to get what they could of the yellow ringers (Gold coins) from the revenues of Dubai, tne reply of those So K~scy 1 J Rulersihecame/that they are unable to accept us among them,and tills is in contravention of the customs prevalent on the coast, we then gave up all hope in that direction. Then two months have passed whilest we were in tne worst condition possible wnich has befallen us, our families and children which has made it necessary for us to go to the Political Agent, Bahrain. Before tne incident we nave sent you a letter on 3rd Safar 1358 in which we have informed you about tne movements of Bedouins ana criminals who were gathered by Sa ? id bin Maktoo m by through the direction of his advisers whilest we still relied on the mediation of H.E. the Political Agent. ' r our have replied to us in your letter No. 218/1939 dated 2ra Safar 1358 that we should make an understanding on that matter witn Sa f id, we have ° to hi m obayed your orders- and sent a letter/about that matter on the morning of 7th Safar 1358 ana on the afternoon of that day the incident took place against us. You have seen these manouvereswhen you were present at the ^rdhah' (beoouin war dances) at Derah, which has resulted in that incident in which tne innocents were killed, who were without weapons ana who were mostly the notables and enlightened youths of town at the hands of these slave dealers amongst whom was Zayid Balminkhas the notarious slave aealer who was killea by our servant, in our house, curing their attack against us. They even took to kidnapping peoples children numbering about twenty whom they took away to the desert settlements of the bedouins, if any were returnee they are very few indeed. Force was used by Sa T id bin Maktoom against the Baluchis, who lived in Majmad, when tne sea was rough that day, and as a result 15 of them were drownea at tne mouth of the Khor of Dubai. ^Iso force was is ed against poor foreigners and others for the construction of a stronghold, free. The ground on which the strongnold was built is owned by one of the notables of tne town, Hashia bin Abdulla bin Juraiz. Tne Juss and stones which belongea to tne towns people was loo tea freely. They oraerea tne people to work by 'Sukhra' (free labour by force) except perhaps a few. They have gone so far with 'Suknra' that they killed a man, Ali bin Sa T id Lakhnawi when they were building the stronghold on 10th Habi-ul-Awwal for no any offence except that he refusea to work by force. Also Ali bin Sa f id al-Ruwaihi / a was killea in Dubai on 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal 1358, and/foreign cooly was killed, a slave woman was also killed, and a slave (man) and one Arab woman were killea on 28th Rabi-ul-Awwai 1358. Looting of our properties ana of foreigners properties is going on in such a way regardless of their responsiblities to the High G-ovt. who undertook (responsibilities ?) in accoraance with the speech of Lord Gurzon, then Viceroy of India, on 21st November 1903 (30tii Sha’aban 1321) in which H.E. said:- 'I want to mention one thing more ana that is that the Shaikhs themselves should avoid troubles in the tuture. Govt, will not interfere into your own internal affairs, as in the past they dia not ao so, proviaea that the Shaikh’s will rule their states with justice”. Is it justice tnat the Dubai state should launch an attack on the members of the Majlis without any reason ? Is it justice that innocent lives should be killed ? Is it justice tnat &lt;tnat the properties of the inhabitants of Derah should be looted without any reason . is it justice that we ask your help for evacuating our properties, women ana relations from tiie town and you ignore such a humainitarian move ? except perhaps very little (?) while it was open to you to ask Sa’id bin maktoom officially in accoruance with the speech of Lord Gurson in which H.S. said:-,. • • • • • andjare Political relations between you wiiich niakes Government as your 'Amir' and your .protector' Is it then fair that you (R.A.) should ignore this state of ai fairs which all can see and hold as being barbaric, and through which insecurity is felt in Dubai, ana by which commercial activities have come to a stanastil to the extent of people insecure ana alarmed at night ana fearful of making any communications in connection with their economical and financial relations, this is nothing short of surprising neglect; I have great hopes that His ^jesty's Government will thoroughly investigate this matter ana i nave every hope that the objects unaerlaying tne matter will be clear to them. Now, two months have passea s4r*te-e since we have been asking you to settle this question, and we ib ve all tne time remained under your oraers until we have, now, given up hope. Dear friend, I bring to your notice the plight of the widows of those sacrificed by despotism, who were unjustly killed. They are starving am without clothes, all of them,those who are with us at Sharjah and those who remained back in Dubai, he nave every hope that the Hon ! ble tne Political Resident ana tne Political Agent, Bahrain, will look into the plight of these who ns ve been put into a pitiable condition, the commands of Hisv^fojestyBs Government above all. I request you to forward t.iis letter to H.S. the Political Agent, Bahrain. I wrote in my previous letter dated (?) a- Rabi-ul-Awwal about the period of tne sg-ary as being one month and eight days, this is wrong; the period is from 7th Safar upto date, 2nd Rabi-ul-Awwal 1358.

No. 75 Dated 25rd May 1853. Both Shaikh Said of Dubai and Mana have come to Bahrain to see me. Mana and party have approach ed successively Shaikhs of Ajman^Umm al Qaiwain and Ras al Khaimah for permission to settle in their States and have been refused on various excuses mainly because these Shaikhs know character of refugees and fear future complications with Dubai. 2. Meanwhile Bhaikh of Sharjah has been encourag ing them to stay with him and Shaikh Said naturally resents continuance of anxious situation thus involved. , , i Communications between the two towns are severed (Imperial Airways are not affected) and Shaikh Said is definitely contemplating attack on Bharjah. 3. I have again told Mana who persists in trying to get 'orders' from me to stay in or near Sharjah (a) that I will give no orders regarding his future residence either to him or to Shaikh Said; (b) that the latter gave me personal promise to return refugees * property only if they go to distant place; (c) that alternatives therefore for them are: (i) to remain in Bharjah, lose their property and provoke fighting; or (ii) to go to a distant Shaikhdom, e.g. Abu Dhabi, receive back property and live in peace. 4 . ^ana claims it is impossible to move before2 sailors if they go far away and that they must have property back now in order to meet expenses of fitting out pearling boats* 1 hese are mere evalsions and I have told him to think over my remarks and see me again in two or three days* seeing Shaikh Said again tomorrow and will enquire if he agrees tokana^s demand for time though I feel sure he will refuse.

I think we should try and meet Mana half way over diving otherwise his boats will not go to pearling and number of divers will be out of work which will rut improve local situation. 2. Following solution occurs to me. Mana to stay in Bahrain and appoint agent in Dubai to whom his property can be handed over and who will make arrangements for pearling. 3. Please ask Shaikh Hamad from me if he would be good enough (a) to allow Mana to stay Bahrain (b) to intervene and induce Shaikh of Dubai and Lana to come to some such terms as in paragraph 2 above. Such intervention by a neutral Shaikh is according to Arab custom, and is especially suitable in the present case which is really a matter of internal affair though we are concerned because of Imperial Airways. If Shaikh Hamad's health does not permit of Ms doing this one of his family could act as his representative2 3. Re. ohaikh of Dubai's threat attack on Sharjah. Though our treaties only forbid states fighting on sea, in view of Imperial Airways commitments at °harjah I do not think we can allow this. If theiefoie mediation creaks down I have in mind prooosin^ obtaining sanction from His Majesty's Government to inform Shaikh of Dubai that any attack on Sharjah would be met by bombardment of his forces from a sloop. We would of course have to be prepared to put this threat into for e if necessary but I imagine that threat almost certainly would prevent attack. Please let me have your comments on this. 4.

They are trying to induce Mana to do this. 4. There is no prospect of any settlement on temporary basis which leaves open possibility of Mana and party returning to Sharjah during or after diving season. 5. Important point is that Shaikh Said will not permit main Dubai pearling fleet to leave so long as menace from ^harjah direction remains. J-’ht only means of removing this menace short of fighting is economic lever.6. Your paragraph 3. I see objections to proposed action which I am submitting by mail. Shaikh Said has given me undertaking not to start attack on Sharjah until after I have visited ^bai Sharjah with new Senior Naval Officer (about June 15th).

B DIATB EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). No. C/346-22/8 Dated 25th May 19 39 To Political Resident, Bushire. my My telegram No. 76 dated the 25th May. Dubai. 2. The position as I see it is as follows t- (a) Shaikh Mana and other refugee ex-Members of the Council were defeated in the struggle with the Shaikh of Dubai and fled to Sharjah, where, owing to its proximity, they constitute a cons tant menace to the peace of the neighbourhood in general and the personal safety of Shaikh Said and his family in particular. (b) This menace is so gravely regarded by the Shaikh of Dubai that his town is constantly surrounded by armed patrols which are liable to fire on anyone at sight, a curfew has been imposed, and there is general unease. (c) Shaikh Mana and his party are encouraged to remain in Sharjah by Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, who after several changes of mind now apparently believes that with the aid of the Lana party he can acquire a predominent position locally, enabling him to recapture much of the Dubai trade and possibly the Daira section of the town itself, to which he maintains a foolish claim. j Shaikh Dultan is a particularly/- , (Signature) (Designation)3/- - 2 - particularly stupid man of weak but ambitious character, with a passion for hare-brained intrigue which is so badly conducted that it invariably redounds to his own disadvantage, (d) The position now existing was not difficult to forecast at the beginning. It could only be evaded by one of two methods: (i) an attack by Dubai on Sharjah; (ii) luring the Mana party away to a distant Sheikhdom with the bait of restored property (immovable pro perty at Dubai being managed by an agent). The latter alternative was tried out, and Shaikh Said gave me his personal promise to restore their property once Shaikh Mana and his party had taken up residence in a distant Sheikhdom and had given the necessary non-aggression pledges. (e) Though advised to apply for permission to reside in Abu Dhabi or Has al Khaimah, Shaikh Mana and his party sought residence first in Ajman (the nearest Shaikhdom), secondly in Umm al 'aiwain (the next nearest) and finally in Has al Khaimah, The first two refused, quite wisely as I think. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah agreed to take them in the first instance, but the Mana party tried to lay down conditions, and these, together vfith the suspicions aroused by their previous approaches to the nearer Sheikhdoms, led finally to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah withdrawing his agreement to their residing in his State# (f) Shaikh Mana and his party have made no approach to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in spite of the fact that all belong to the same main tribe. The reason given by Mana is that Abu Dhabi is too far away and that he and his companions cannot manage their affairs from such a distance. The real reason, as generally suspected, is that Abu Dhabi being an island would be on extremely bad place from which to organise future intrigue and possible attack on Dubai. There is no doubt in my mind that the ultimate object of Mana and his companions is to regain power in Dubai and evict or kill Shaikh Said ond his closer relatives.—3— 3. This state of affairs has now continued for two months and it is impossible not to sympathise with Shaikh Said in wish ing to put an end to it* There is no doubt that he cam do so with the greatest ease, since a Dubai attack on Shariah would probably be completely successful within a few hours. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr could expect little or no support from other Ghafiri Shaikhs, 4. In common justice therefore if we are to stop Shaikh Said attacking Sharjah we must remove the menace now existing there. Any sort of concession to Shaikh Mana and his party must, in my opinion, be rejected. They have had two full months in which to follow the course suggested to them and if, as a result of their own conduct, they now lose the benefit of part or all of the coming pearling season they have only themselves to blame. The number of sailors whom they would employ is only a small proportion of the total Dubai pearling fleet which will not be able to sail from Dubai so long as the Mana menace remains in Sharjah, 5 . I have discussed the whole matter at some length with Shaikh Sir Hamad, Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman whose opinion is that Mana and his party must leave Sharjah for a distant Shaikhdom and give the necessary undertakings before they can receive any part of their property back. They are advising Shaikh Mana accordingly (and will probably add — since their personal sympathies are with him -- that the future may produce an opportunity for him to re-establish himself in Dubai), 6 * It is essential that, v/hether the ultimate place of residence be Abu Dhabi, Bahrain or some other distant place, the whole of the Mana party, including the two Huraizat, the two Battis and the Bin Thanis, should go there immediately as well as Shaikh Mana. I do not think the Shaikh of Bahrain is anxious for them to come here but he will, I am sure, agree if they/--4- they make the request to him. If on the other hand we make the request the Mana party itself will find some excuse for not coming to Bahrain. I am therefore awaiting the result of the next two days 1 conversations between Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Mana before acting on paragraph 3(a) of your telegram No. T/1C2 dated the 24th May 1939. 7. In regard to paragraph 3 of your telegram just quoted. In view of the considerations set out above I feel that the threat to the Shaikh of Dubai suggested therein is unjust and may have grave results in encouraging the Mana party to remain in Sharjah and the Shaikh of Sharjah in his anti- Dubai intrigues. Before receiving your telegram I had pointed out to Shaikh Said that an attack on Sharjah might involve damage to British property and in particular to Imperial Airways* and I made it clear that sucii damage would involve heavy retribution. Shaikh Said guarantees that there will be no damage to Imperial Airways either in Dubai or in Sharjah, and I believe that he is perfectly capable of carrying out this guarantee. 8. Regarding the question from another angle I see two alternative disadvantages in the suggestion (i) Though it is unlikely, the Shaikh might ignore the threat and attack. In that case he would certainly take a large part if not the whole of Sharjah in a few hours. If he made his attack by night his forces would be in occupation of part of Sharjah by dawn when bombardment might start? and we should then be precluded from bombarding through fear of damage to Sharjah property and to innocent persons. (ii) If, as is more likely, the Shaikh of Dubai gave way before the threat, we should earn his fierce and persistent hostility for refusing to allow him to protect his own interests --5- intercsts in a simple and traditional manner. The Shaikh of Sharjah and the Mana party would be greatly encouraged to intensify their anti-Dubai activities and I should expect as a result the early revival of disturbances in Dubai, since our motives would be misrepresented. Incidentally they would be misunderstood in other Sheikhdoms, Coastal or Hinterland, whose reaction^ would be to avoid granting us (or P.C.L) further facilities lest they involve our interference in similar internal affairs. I am convinced that if pressure now being brought to bear through Bahrain Shaikhs on Shaikh Mana and his party to leave Sharjah is ineffective, our own interests will be far better served by standing aside. The mere threat of attack will probably suffice to produce results. I hope to be (subject to your approval) on a Trucial Coast cruise with the new Senior Naval Officer by the middle of June and we should be at hand if there were need either for protection of British subjects or for mediation between Dubai and Sharjah.Telegram G.T.C.

Memorandum Reference your memorandum No. C/299 dated the 18th May 1939. 2. As you know both Shaikh Said and Shaikh Mana have come to Bahrain to see me. The former ostensibly wished to obtain permission from me to attack Sharjah, and was of course told that if he did so and if any damage was caused to the lives or property of British subjects, and in particular to Imperial Airways, heavy retribution would be exacted. His actual object was of course to see what could be done about expediting the departure of Shaikh Mana and his party from Sharjah. 3, Shaikh Mana still seemed to believe that he would be able to remain in Sharjah and receive back his property. He argued that it was impossible to move until the end of the diving season. Unless he lived in Sharjah or somewhere near he could not collect his sailors or send out his boats. With the aid of Shaikh Hamad and other Bahrain ohaikhs however it has been impressed on Shaikh Mana that so long as he remains in Sharjah there is no prospect of his receiving back his property. Shaikh Mana now pretends that he understands the matter more clearly and arrangement has been made for him to go by launch from here to Abu Dhabi where he will apply to Shaikh Shakhbut for permission for himself and his party/-- 2 - party to reside there on the usual undertakings for peace. It is possible that he may make another effort to obtain permission from the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, but whichever it may be I think there is now a better prospect of Shaikh Bfiana and his party leaving Sharjah in the near future. I have written a letter to Shaikh Shakhbut, in order to remove misunderstanding, saying that there is no objection on our part to l^ana and his party living in Abu Dhabi. I shall give this letter to Shaikh Mana to take with him when he leaves here in a day or two. 4. Shaikh Said will probably return to Dubai tomorrow. He has given me a definite undertaking not to attack Sharjah at present and I have told him I will come along to Dubai and see how things are going very soon. I expect to accompany the new Senior Naval Officer on a cruise of all the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms at that time but will give you more detailed information later. 5.

The attack took place at ten O'clock of the day on 7th da far 1358(29th Larch 1939) . I at once sent by motor car my son Hash id bin Liani 1 and Sa l id bin Humaid al Basti CO you.

On 8th Safar(30th March) I sent you a letter at 6 C 1 clock informing you of our condition and that we were waiting for you to come but you did not come nor did you send anyone to us 0 V/e remained in our critical state for three mornings and a half. At the last part of the night we came out and on the third day in uhe morning corresponding to the 9th 3afar(31st March) we went to the Agency at Sharjah at 2 O’clock /arable with uhe sons of Shaikh Bati bin buhail and most of the no babies of the mlbu Falesah and others oi the Jc-ma r all (people).

He, nay God preserve him, promised to return our existing properties to us as well r.s the lost ones and to give us sufficient allowances This was Iso repeated to us by you several times.

Being- in despair and as it is now about two months that we have been experiencing great difficulty with our families and children, we have decided to go to the Political Agent,Bahrain. Before the incident we sent you a letter on 3rd Safar 1358(25th Larch 1939) about the ctivities of the mischievous bedouins- who were collected by Shaikh da* id bin Laktum at the instigation 1 of his advisers.

He Iso forced foreigners, poor people and others to build the Fort free. The land on which the fort is being built belongs to one of the notables, hash id bin ‘Abdullah bin Buraia. He( shaikh ^a 1 idj plundered the jus (lime) end stone of the town people without paying for it. Pith the exception of some of them, they made the people to work free. This compulsory work had caused one of them to kill one Ali bin Sa ’ id al Ha navi on 10th. Rabi’ al Auwal(30th f.pril 1939) at the work in the fort for no fault except that he refused to do compulsory work.

They condemned ’Ubaid's action and requested Shaikh Rashid to keep him in prison until they request him to release him. Shaikh Rashid sent him to prison and ordered that he should be put in stocks. ’Ubaid’s statement about liquor and money is not believed by the Dubai authorities and his relatives end it was suggested that he must had been instigated by Mani' or his party to do mischief for which Shaikh Sa’id would be blamed. 2.
