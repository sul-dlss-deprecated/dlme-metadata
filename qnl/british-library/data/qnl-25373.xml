(' J To The Right Honourable AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 1st October 1915, Sir, We have the honour to invite a reference to paragraph 2 of our despatch No. 58, dated the 16th July 1915, in which we expressed our intention to make a further communication to you regarding the treatment of fees received in the Consulates on the Persian Coast. 2. It is understood that the enquiry made by the Foreign Office in the second paragraph of their letter No. 32920, dated the 1st September 1914, is ) confined to fees levied under, and charges arising out of, the administration of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, and that it does not extend to the adjustment between the Imperial and Indian Governments of all receipts and expenditure at the Consulates in Persia and on the Persian Gulf. If this assumption is correct, the information required by the Foreign Office can be furnished without difficulty. There have been no disbursements since 1900 on account of charges arising out of the Order and, probably for this reason, the question of including such charges in the annual statements of the expenditure incurred by the Government of India on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia has never been raised. The agreement reported in Mr. Fowler’s Political despatch No. 40, dated the 16th of May 1895, is still adhered to as regards the credit to our Government of all fees levied under the Order. No separate account of these receipts is, however, maintained. We have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants,1915. SIMLA. FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. ESTABLISHMENT.

To The Right Hon’ble AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Dated Simla, the 16th July 1915. Sir, With reference to paragraph 2 of Lord Crewe’s despatch, No. 124-Pohtical dated the 23rd October 1914, we have the honour to forward, for the information* of His Majesty’s Government, a note together with two statements prepared by the Comptroller of India Treasuries, which furnish the information required by His Lordship regarding the items “ Escort ” and “ Additional Escort, Shiraz ” shown under “ Persian Legation ” in the statement of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia during the year 1912-13. 2 . With regard to paragraph 3 of the despatch under reference we propose to make a further communication to you as soon as we have complete information as to the manner in which fees received in the Consulates on the Persian Coast are brought to account. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants,r Note prepared by the Comptroller of India Treasuries. In connec tion with the statement of Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia for 1912- 13, His Majesty’s Secretary of State has called for the following information :— (1) A statement explaining the apparent decrease of cost under “ Escort ” in the Persian Legation as compared with the figures for 1911-12. (2) A statement explaining the apparent increase under “ additional escort ” in the Persian Legation over the sanctioned estimate. These particulars are given below :— Item {!).—A statement showing side by side the charges adjusted in 1911-12 and 1912-13 has been prepared and is attached. It will be seen that the strength of the escort was not reduced in 1912-13, but the apparent decrease of cost in 1912-13 was due to the fact that the figures for 1911-12 included (a) arrear pay of the Tehran Escort for the previous year {viz. for the quarter ending February 1911) and (6) the additional cost involved in the relief of the Ispahan Escort in 1911-12, chiefly due to the inclusion of the pay of the relieving party during the period of transit from the date of departure from their regiment in India to the date of relief of the relieved party in Persia when the pay of the latter ceased to be adjusted by the Civil Department [vide rule 32 of the Rules regarding the employment of native cavalry regiments as Consular guards in Persia). Item {2 ).—A statement showing details of the amount adjusted in 1912-13 is appended. The details have been furnished by the Controller of Military Accounts, 5th (Mhow) Division who audited the charges which were then adjusted in the books of this office. It will be seen from the details of the sanctioned estimate of Rs. 10,771 that the estimate only calculated the increase of annual cost on the revision of the establishment. Old azole. Rs. New scale.

Mr. Fowler is of opinion that the fees, penalties, fines, and forfeitures levied under the Order, and referred to in Clause 3 of the 44 th Article, provide a fund from wdiich such charges as are described in the enclosure to the Letter from the Government of India should be met; and, subject to Lord Kimberley’s concurrence, he desires me to suggest that the sanction of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury be obtained for the payment of these and any similar charges in the future in the manner indicated.

With reference to your letter of the 2 nd ultimo, in regard to the incidence of charges in connection with the administration of criminal justice under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1889, I am directed by the Earl of Kimberley to request that you will lay before the Secretary of State for India in Council the following considerations:— The Order in Council, as Mr. Secretary Fowler is aware, is admi nistered by the officials of the Indian Government holding Consular rank, and acting in general conformity with Indian law and procedure. At the suggestion of your Department, however, and as a matter of convenience, the instructions under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council were drafted at this Office at the same time, and issued at the same date, by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as the instructions under the Persia (Inland) Order in Council, 1889. To these instructions a schedule of fees is appended ; the imposition of fees is provided for by Article 43, Sub-Article 1 of the Order. This Article is as follows :— “ Subject to the control of the Secretary of State, acting with the concurrence of the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury, the Consul-General may from time to time, with the previous sanction of the Governor General of India in Council, make rules imposing fees leviable in respect of any proceedings in, or processes issued out of, any Court established under this Order ” A 2 25295.4 Article 44 provides further:— ( 3 .) “AH fees, penalties, fines,'and forfeitures levied under this Order shall he paid to the public account, and shall be applied in such manner as the Commissioners of Her Majesty s Treasury may direct.” The provisions of the Persia (Inland) Order in Council in regard to this matter are contained in Article 40, and are as follows:— “ All fees, fines, forfeitures, and pecuniary penalties levied under this Order shall be carried to the public account, and be applied as the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Commissioners of the Treasury, from time to time directs.” On 11 th November 1892, and again on 24th October 1893, your Department transferred to this Department the fees levied at Bushire under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. These fees had been credited by the Consul-General to the Govern ment of India, but your Department appear to have considered that they properly belonged to Her Majesty’s Home Government. The correctness of this view was not questioned at the time, and the fees were accepted. The fees received on this account up to the present are,— £ s. d. Transferred to Foreign Office by India Office 11th November 1892 5 19 4 Ditto, ditto, 24th October 1893 11 12 5 Ditto, ditto, 24th July 1894 - - - 3 12 8 Credited in Bushire accounts,— 1st January 1893 to 31st December 1894 7 15 0 £28 19 5 The claim of the Indian Government to the repayment of expenses incurred at Bushire in the administration of justice is based on the grounds that the Imperial Treasury receive the fees and that the Political Resident exercises jurisdiction under the Order in virtue of the consular powers vested in him by this Office. There would be considerable force in the first reason if a formal decision had been come to in favour of crediting the fees to the Home Government, and if the persons in whose cases the expenses were incurred had not been British Indians. As regards the second argument, 1 am to point out the Order in Council explains the term “ Consul General ” to mean “ the person for “ the time being holding the office of Her Majesty’s Consul General for “Pars .... and of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.” The Order proceeds to include under the term, “a person acting temporarily, “ with the approval of the Governor General of India in Council as, or “ for, the Political Resident.” It will be observed that there is no mention of the necessity of an approval of an acting appointment by the Secretary of State. In the case of permanent appointments, a Royal Commission is issued through this Department, but the selection of the officer appointed is entirely in the hands of the Indian authorities, by whom the Political and Consular Establishments in those regions is almost entirely main tained. On a full consideration of the whole matter, and after consultation with the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s 'treasury, Lord Kimberley is of opinion, in which the Treasury concur, that the fees hitherto, and hereafter to be, levied under the Persian Coast Order in Council should be remitted to the Indian Government, and that all charges arising out of the administration of the Order should be defrayed out of Indian funds.6 I am to inquire whether Mr. Secretary Fowler shares His Lordship’s view, or whether he has any objection to offer to the issue, by the Board of Treasury, of directions in the sense proposed, in exercise of the powers vested in them by Article 44, Sub-article (o) of the Order. 1 am, &amp;c. } H. Percy Anderson. The Under Secretary of State for India. No. 3. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 14th May 1895. The Secretary of State for India, having considered in Council your letter of the 24th April on the subject of charges connected with the administration of criminal justice under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, accepts the proposal therein contained, that the fees hitherto, and hereafter to be, levied under the Order should be remitted to the Indian Government, and that all charges arising out of the administration of the Order should be defrayed out of Indian funds. The last item of 11. 15s., stated in your letter under reply to have been credited in the Bushire accounts for 1st January 1893 to 31st December 1894, has not been, and will not be, transferred to the Foreign Office.

I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter of the 25th March 1912, No. 7797/12, regarding the inclusion of charges in respect of leave and pension in the annual statement of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. The rates on which the Indian charges have been calculated were set forth in this Office letter of the 14th duly 1911, which stated that the contri butions were assessed at a fixed proportion of the pay drawn, ranging from one-fourth in the case of higher officers to one-fifth and one-sixth in the case of subordinate officers. In 1912 the Secretary of State sanctioned a revision of these rates, as set forth in the enclosure to the Government of India’s Letter No. 85, dated 5th March 1915 (copy enclosed). It is accordingly proposed to apply the revised rates (which were sanctioned for general adoption on the understanding that the increase was required for the protection of Indian revenues) in assessing the leave and pension contributions recoverable from the Imperial Government in connection with the Consular and Diplomatic services in Persia, :i: ' with effect from the beginning of the current financial year. His Lordship assumes that Sir Edward Grey will have no objection to this course, but before he approves the Government of India’s recommendation he will be glad to receive an intimation of the concurrence of your Department. It will lie observed that the new rates provide for privilege leave allowances as well as the allowances attached to other kinds of leave that were covered by the old rates. Privilege leave allowances drawn by officers employed in Persia would therefore be excluded from, the annual claim on your Department when the new rates of contribution are introduced.

We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Mr. Robinson’s demi-official letter No. E.-1604, dated the 3rd April 1912, to Sir James Meston on the subject of the arrangement by which a percentage in respect of pensionary and leave allowances isrincludedfin the annual statement of divisible expenditure on the Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia. 2. Your Lordship will observe that the percentages to be taken were fixed on the analogy of the rules in Articles 795 and 768 of the Civil Service Regu lations as they then stood. The Comptroller, India Treasuries, has now brought to notice the fact that as the said rules have been revised with effect from the 1st August 1913, these percentages should properly be altered. We enclose a copy of his letter on the subject. His proposals appear to us to be suitable and we recommend that they be adopted, the new rates of calculation being applied from the commencement of next financial year.

Majumdau, Esq., Comptroller, India Treasuries, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Depaetment. I have the honour to invite a reference to the Government of India, Finance Department, endorsement No. 2844-A., dated 30th April 1912, regarding the leave and pension contributions recoverable from. His ^ Majesty’s Imperiaf Government in connection with the Consular and Diplomatic Services in Persia from which it would appear that it was decided, with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Secretary of State, to calculate the amounts of the contribu tion at fixed percentages on the actual charges under salaries and establish ment based on the rates laid down in Articles 795 and 768, Civil Service Regulations, as they then stood. Now that the foreign service rules in the Civil Service Regulations have been revised with effect from 1st August 1913 the question has arisen whether 4 he old rates or the new rates should be applied to the calculation in question, and if the latter, from which date, whether from 1st August 1913 the date of the revision of the foreign service rules or some later date. For purposes of calculation it will be convenient to apply the new rates from the beginning of a financial year. The new and old rates are shown below The new rates provide for privilege leave allowances and therefore the amounts of such allowances as well as allowances during long leave will have to be deducted from the gross figures charged in the accounts before applying the lates.

My Lord, Revision of rules relating to — I have considered in Council your Financial (1) foreign service; Letter of the 12th October last, No. 244, forwarding ( 2 ) acceptance of outside em- ^ or approval a draft of revised rules relating to employment by officers on f° re ig' n service, which you propose to issue in super- leave. ' session of those contained in Chapters NXXIX. to XLI. of the Civil Service Regulations. You also forward for my information copies of Articles 200 and 598 which have recently been revised by your Government so as to deal with the acceptance of outside employment by officers on leave. 2 . 1 desire to recognise the care and thorough ness with which the revision of the foreign service « rules has been accomplished. The existing regula tions have been entirely overhauled and re-arranged, they have been made simpler and more elastic in many respects, and much obsolete or unnecessary matter has disappeared. Among other changes the revised rules allow a wider discretion to Local Governments in authorising transfers to foreign service in India and in fixing the pay to be drawn; and, subject to certain conditions, they permit the delegation of such powers by the Local Governments to authorities subordinate to them. 3. I observe that in the new rule 754 you omit the words “ except with the sanction of the Govern ment of India ” which occur in the corresponding old rule 784. I do not think it is desirable to exclude entirely the consideration of special cases, which hitherto have been dealt with sparingly under the safeguards described in paragraph 2 of Lord Minto’s Lespatch No. 12 F.D., dated 27th January 1910. I have therefore decided that the words omitted should be retained. 4. I notice (Article 770) that you propose to increase the rate of contribution for leave and pension payable in respect of officers of the classes mentioned in Article 763 (i) from Jth to yglhs assumed pay, and to prescribe for the first time a rate of contribution payable for leave and pension of other classes of officers, viz., Jth of assumed pay. I 723*.In the latter case, it will be observed, the new rate for leave and pension combined bears a somewhat higher proportion to the rate for pension only (viz., 32 : 16) than it does in the former case (30 : 16). I presume that your Government are satisfied that the increased rate of contribution for leave and pension in the case of the one class of officers, and the new and somewhat high rate in the case of the other class are required for the protection of your revenues, and on that understanding I sanction their adoption. 5. At the same time I enclose a memorandum on the proposed rules as a whole, and subject to consideration by l our Government of the amend ments therein suggested, I approve the issue of the rules without further reference to me. Some ob servations on Articles 200 and 598 of the Civil Service Regulations are also included in this memorandum. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Crewe.ENCLOSURE. Memorandum. Suggestions for Amendment of Revised Rules relnting to foreign Service and Private Employment submitted with the Government of India’s Financial Letter No. 244, dated 12th October 1911. Article 750.—Under the existing regulations tenure of a Political Agency established at the charge of a Native State is regaided as foreign service of the third kind. Will it now be regarded as foreign service ? If so, it may be thought desirable to indicate in Article 750 to which category the service now belongs. Article 753, line 4.—As the contribution may be paid by the employer and not by the officer himself it would seem preferable to sa} “ contribution is paid ” rather than ' he contributes. Article 758. —For the same reason this Article might presumably be modified as follows : — “ When an officer is transferred to foreign service he draws salary from his foreign employer, and contribution is paid to Govern ment, from the date on which he relinquishes chaige of his appointment under Government. An officer reverting to duty under Government ceases to draw pay from the foreign employer, and contribution is discontinued, from the date on^ which he resumes charge of his appointment under Government.” Article 759, Note. —It seems worth consideration whether the references in this Note to various Articles in the Civil Service Regu lations might not with advantage be omitted. Che references are numerous and will need constant watching if retained, and the conditions laid down in the Note would seem to be expressed with sufficient precision without them, except as regards (3), in which the words “ is required to retire ” might be amplified. Article 763.—After “ pension ” in sixth line query insert “ otherwise the sanction of the Government of India is required.” (See Article 753 (ii) (b) of present Regulations). Article 763 (i).—Instead of “ members of a ^service which is subject to ” would it not be simpler to say “ officers subject to ” ? Article 764.—The provisions of this Article do not seem appropriate to and are presumably not intended to apply to, foreign service out of India (e.u., the rules in IV. (a) and (b) regarding increases of pay would not be applicable to service under a Colonial Government in \\ est Africa or elsewhere). If this be so, the words “ in India ” might be inserted after “ foreign service ” in the first line of the Article. Article 765 (a).—For “ one transferred to service out of India contributes for pension only ’ query substitute “if the transfer be to service out of India contribution is made for pension on }. Article 765 {b) For “ In the case of an officer who contributes ” query substitute “ When contribution is paid” ; and for contributions aie substitute “ it is.’Article 767 ( 6 ). -Paragraph following (ii). At the end of this paragraph it is proposed to impose a different maximum for assumed pay ” according as contribution is paid for leave and pension or for pension only. There does not seem to be any reason why the assumed pay should be affected by this circumstance why, for example, the assumed pay of an officer lent to a Native State should be subject to a higher maximum than if he were lent to a Colonial Crovernment. In the former analogous Article 7t&gt;5 (a) the maxima of Its. 1,500 and its. 1,250 for officers whose maximum pension was Its. o ,000 were applied to officers of the European and the Indian Services heave Rules, respectively, a logical distinction, because the former draw a higher maximum furlough allowance than the latter (see Note 2 to Article 755 (a) (i) of present Regulationsj. 1 he distinction between the two (“lasses of officers seems to be provided for in the different rates of contribution y^ths as compared with T 4 6 ths. Article 768. —For “subject to the leave rules in Chapter XIII.,” query substitute “mentioned in Article 763 (i).” Please see also remark on Article 767 ( 6 ) above. Article 770, Note L—Is this a departure from the rule in Note 1 to present Article / 07 (F), which seems to imply that in addition to then contributions Indian Civil Service officers have to pay the 4 per cent, deduction.? An additional note might be appended to Article 770 to the effect that when Indian troops are lent to the War Office for service out of India a contribution towards Indian pension at the rate of one-eighth of effective pay is paid by the War Office to the India Office m respect of the Indian Native officers, non-commissioned officers, and men and followers; and that in the case of the British officers a share of the pensions ultimately granted is borne by the War Office through the India Office Non-Effective Account. Article 772 (b). -Query omit “ leave allowances and ” and after the word “ pensious ’ insert in brackets “ [and in cases (ii) to (v) leave allowances].” Article 772 ( 6 ) (i).—This clause might be reconstructed as follows:— “Officers lent to His Majesty’s Government or to British Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c. In such cases, if the loan is to the \\ ai Office a share of the pension ultimately granted to the officer is paid by the War Office through the Non-Effective Account, but if it is to a British Colony or Protectorate, pension contribution is paid at the time of the loan by the employing Government, either to the Government of India or to the India Office. When, however, an officer is ullowed to take up duties undei the W ai Office, he may in certain circumstances be required to^ pay a pension contribution in respect of the period of the loan. Article 775 (a).—Query substitute the following, and renumber proposed (a), ( 6 ), and (c) as (b), (c), and (d) ■ “Cases in which officers are lent to His Majesty’s Government or to British Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c., and in which the contribution is payable by the borowing Government (see Article 772 (b)(i)).'’ Article 780.— If, as is presumed to be the case, this article applies only to officers on foreign service in India, words might perhaps be added to show that this is so. Articles 782, 783.—Is it necessary to include these articles in the Civil Service Regulations ?/ / '~N Article 200.—“ Resident out of India ” (line 2); “ resident in India ” (line 3). The division might more appropriately be in accordance with that prescribed in regard to applications for extension of leave or permission to return to duty (vide Articles 224, 225, 237 (a), and 238). Article 598.—The wording of this article would perhaps be improved if for the words “ if he desires ” in third line to “ resign ” in fourth line the following were substituted : “ unless before the expiry of his leave he shall have resigned.”COPY OF TELEGRAM 17»76. 1.1694. 10,000.—11/1914.

The papers therefore focus on financial adjustments to be made between the India Office and the Foreign Office. Accounts of this expenditure can therefore be found within the file, along with supplementary correspondence. This correspondence is concerned with querying or disputing items of expenditure, or with changes to accounting practices. This correspondence is primarily between officials of the India Office and the Foreign Office, with occasional reference made to the Government of India, and occasional submissions to the Secretary of State for India.Specific matters discussed within the file include the following: an overspend on a survey for the Mohammerah-Burujird Railway undertaken by Captain Wilson (ff 171-180), expenditure on additional consular escort at Shiraz and Meshed (ff 45-48, 114-117, and 63-66 for specific detail of charges for Shiraz), and the revision of the rates at which leave and pensions are calculated (ff 70-100).The following sets of financial papers can be found within:expenditure by the Imperial Government in Persia, and at Nakawn Lampang (Lakhon) and Chiengmai. Statements for the following years can be found within the file: 1910-11 and 1911-12 (ff 228-232), 1911-12 and 1912-13 (ff 160-164), 1912-13 and 1913-14 (ff 80-85);expenditure by the Government of India compared with the previous financial year; each statement contains a supplement on expenditure at Bahrein [Bahrain], Koweit [Kuwait], and Maskat [Muscat]. Statements for the following years can be found within the file: 1911-12 (ff 189-200 and ff 213-224, two copies), 1912-13 (ff 153-155), and 1913-14 (ff 49-61);specific statements are also supplied for expenditure on the Koweit Agency as follows: 1911-12 (ff 206-209 and ff 234-236, two copes), 1912-13 (ff 153-155), and 1913-14 (ff 42-43);records of financial adjustments made between the India Office and the Foreign Office between 1900-01 to 1915-16: see ff 33-36, ff 148-151, and ff 201-205.The creation dates cover the bulk of papers within the file. However, a printed copy of a letter from 16 May 1895 with enclosures dating back to 2 March 1895 has also been included (folios 67-69). It concerns charges in connection with the administration of criminal justice under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council (1889).Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
