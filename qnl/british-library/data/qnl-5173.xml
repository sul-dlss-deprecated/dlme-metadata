Al-Awanir, A1 Duru 9 . ^he vears during which the Zakat was paid are:- (i) In '■he he^inninlr of the rule of Sultan bln Zayid over Abu Dhabi 1340 A.F. 1922 A.D. and (ii) in the beginning o^ the rule of Saqar bin Z a yid over Abu Dhabi- 1345 A.H. 1926 A.D. In the first year i.e. 1340 the Zakat collector was an offi cial2 j/m official of Sbdullah bin Jalawi named Said. In the second year i.e. 1345 it was Mtiha.rampd bin Mansur. of Ahtoad bin Hilal in Jaimi and then pitches his tent in Saifc Hamanah sending his officials to Duru and Awamir tribes and A 1 Bu Shamis Bedouins. Then the Shaikhs of all these tribes come to him and pay the Zakat. except on the +hree afore-said Zakat-oaying tribes and the rest such as Al-Dhav;ahi r, Bani Katab, Bani Ka^, iiaim and Bani Yas do not care for him. This is (their attitude) at present. After the death of Za:rid bin Khalifah, during the sheikhdom o^ Hand an bin Zayid of Abu Bhabi , a fighting took place between the tribes of Al-Bu-Shami s, Al-Duru and Al- Awamir and the ^ribes of lianasir and Bani Yas residing in Bhufrah. r ’he combat lasted for some t- ; me, but Shaikh Kamdan bin Z R yid intervened and reconciled them. Then peace was conducted the Shaikhs of the three tribes- Muhammad bin ^alnin, the Sheikh of Al Bu She mi s; and Muhammad bin Said bin Hamid, the Shaikh of Al-T&gt;uru; and Hamad bin Salim bin Hazzak, the ^ le ikh of Al-AwaBir - agreed (among themselves) to put themselves undezjfthe aegis of the King Ibn Ssud. Thus Muhamraed bin Salmin and a certain Muslim bin Alham from the Awamir tribe set out with decent presents from the three tri bes such as £ood camels and presented them to the Amir of Ahsa Abdullah bin Jalawi and sought his protection.

Regarding what happened during the interval betv;een the death of Zaiyid and the present day. After the demise of Zaiyid during the rule of Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaivid over Abu Dhabi, a fighting took place between the Manasir and ^ani Yas residents of Dhufrah and the Southern Bedouins of Awamir and Ruru and it lasted for some time. r, he Shaikhs of Manasir and Kazari tribes went from Dhufrah to Ahsa, offered the presents of camels to the Amir Abdullah bin Jalawi, sought his protection and left their camels in Ahsa desert. Abdullah bin Jalawi accepted their pr sente, gave them clothes and money in return and consented to their coming under the aegis of the King Ibn Baud. ri he Manasir stayed there with their camels as did some of the Maxari . As for the rest of the tribes of Bani v as, A1 Hawamil, Qibyat , A1 Maharibah and Marar they left their camels in the Southern halting places and Braimi country, migrating to Abu Dhabi and the islands under it. Af+er the dispersion of these tribes from Dhufrah Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid came to Braimi and ..brought7 'brought about a reconciliation amongst the fighting elements. After peace was effected the hani Yas tribes returned one by one to Dhufrah, repaired their houses and renovated + heir date groves. So did the remai ning liazari tribes in Ahsa with their camels and thus had no connection left in Misa. With regard to the Manasir tribe some of them returned to Dhufrah with their cattle, o+hers spend the winter in Ahsa and summer in Dhufrah, while others are still staying in Ahsa with their cattle going and coming from Ahsa to Dhufrah. Afterwards Sultan bin Zaiyid killed his brother Shaikh Hamdan bin Zayid in the year 1340 A.H. and became the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. ri he King Ibn Saud and the Amir of Ahsa turned his enemy on accoun x o^* the murder of his brother Hamdan bin Zayid as he was their friend and confederate and, when the time for collecting Zakat from the Bedouin subjects of the King Ibn Saud came, the Amir of Ahsa appointed his man Said with a number of others. ?hev came to Baynunah west of Dhufrah country and collected Z a kat from the Kane sir Maxari and all + he tribes subject to ' , ' ) hufrah country. Shaikh Sultan bin Zavid wanted to prevent the Zaks t-Golle ctor from taking Z a kat from the inhabitants of Dhufrah but was not able to do so. When Shaikh Saqar bin Zayid murdered his bro + he r Shaikh Sultan bin Zavid in 1345 A.H. and became the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, there grew up friendship and unity between him and the King Ibn S a ud and +he Amir of Ahsa Abdullah bin Malawi afraid as he was of the sons of Sultan bin Zayid overthrowing him with the help of the King Ibn S a ud and the Amir of Ahsa. He used to try to pay the Zakat collec ted from the people of Yhufrah and Braimi. Shaikh Saqar bin Zayid was also killed at -he hands of the Manasirs and a ser vant of Sultan bin Zaiyd and Shakhbut bin Zayid became the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. In the early rule^of Rhakhbut bin Sultan over Abu Ulmbi the pa ■'men t of Zakat became rather slow as compared with ..what8 what it was, as mertioned etoove , in the daj^s of the two Sheikhs. ?or instance, when the Zakat-collector came to Baynunah west of Bhufrah country and wanted to levy Zakat on the Manasir tribes whose camels were in Baynunah or, when he arrived at Liwa south of Bhufrah country, levied Zakat on the Mazari tribe and wanted to collect the Zakat of the camels from the rest of the Bani ' r as tribes, they would hide their camels and uretend that thay had no camels and that they were divers, and thus the Zakat* colle ct or would not insist. Similar is the casefwith the iianasirs living in Liwa south of Bhufrah country, who, now since four years, do not pay any Zakat with the exception of the A1 Bu Manzar tribe whose Shaikh is in Ahsa. '''he reason for the tardiness in the payment of Zakat in 1349 A.H. (1930t31) was a fight between the Hawamil tribe of Bani !'as and the officials o^ the Amir of Ahea in / which Muhammad as-Sahli and his official colleagues received received serious blows and none of the four tribes uaid tbs Zakat which was also refused by the Maria sirs whose camels were in the halting places of the south. The Bani Yas tribes launched a complaint before Shaikh Shakhbrat bin Sultan. T v e Shaikh wrote letters to the Amir of Ahsa about it and the i reply came that a misunderstanding had taken place between the officials and the Shaikh’s subjects. Since that case up till now the Zakat-colle ct or rpe.kes no harsh demands unon the — t inhabitants of the sou^h of Bhufrah country but asks them po litely and still they do not pay an- thing. The Bari Yas tribes assert they are Ahu Bhabi subjects,all of them are divers, they go a-diving in Abu Bhabi and the islands under it and the Shaikh takes parts of their diving earnings as wel£ as the Zakat on the fruit of the date gardens in Liwa. As for the liana si r tribes they themselves wish to remain under the aegis of the King Ibn Gaud and pav him Zakat because the ^ latter’s power is increasing while the Shaikh of Abu Bhabi is getting weak.13 Data regarding Silcak.

Has three brothers:- Hazza, Khalid and Zaid, the second of whom is not on a par with the other two, Hazza would probably succeed Shakhbut. Shakhbut has two sons:- Said (19 yrs.) by Faqira bint Shakhbut (an Abu Dhabi resident) and Sultan (7 yrs.) by the same wife. The former has chronic syphilis, is at present unmarried and an unmitigated profligate. Shaikh Shakhbut took unto himself a second wife of tender age one Afra bint Ahmad bin Khalaf al Utaiba (a Nejdi merchant who is always with the Ruler) who left him after one night never to return. She is said to have grown enormously fat and to have incurred the disapproval of the Ruler's first wife and mother although the Ruler himself is reported to be fond of her. 15) Probable Successor. (a) Said bin Shakhbut is not a favourite for the rather perilous 'throne' and I don't think he would be accepted. as (b) Sultan bin Shakhbut is very young/yet. (c) Hazza bin Sultan, the present Ruler's brother, is popular, brave and pious (sic) and would most likely take over if there were a change in the near future and the next most probable successor is the other brother Zaid who is said to have the same attributes. (d) Hazza toin Sultan married (l) a sister of Hamdam bin Hamdam (the aspirant living in Dubai to the Rulership), (2) a daughter of Said bin Zaid i.e. his niece. Has no children. (e) Khalid bin Sultan married a daughter of Buti bin Khulfan (local merchant) and has a daughter and a son Mohammed. (f) Zaid bin Sultan married (l) a daughter of Mohammed bin Khalifah, his uncle, (2) a daughter of Mohammed bin Rashid of the Dhuwahir. He has no children. OTHER PERSONALITIES IN ABU DHABI . 1) Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid, uncle of the present ruler and the one taho installed him on the 'throne'. Has much influence over the Ruler, and spends some time in Baraimi. Shaikh Khalifah has one son Mohammed who supports the Ruler. Shaikh Khalifah's mother is from the Manasir, hence in part the adherence of that tribe to the Ruler. 2) Hamid bin Buti brother of the Ruler's mother of the Qubaisat - also a close adviser of the Ruler and in his confidence. Ahmad bin Khalaf al Utaiba (Nejdi merchant resident inAbu Dhabi) whose daughter was the Ruler’s wife He is always with the Ruler but I am not sure 4-v^o +■ i q aK^nintfllv trustworthy. His sons live in Dubai.zn Dhiyab bin 3aqor al-Zayid has given rne the following statement: That zibu-Dhabi was ruled by his grandfather Zayid, and after latter's death Tahnoon eldest son of Zayid ruled, who died^ after Tahnoon, his younger brother harridan bin Zayid became ruler of ribu Dhabi, but he was murdered by his brother Sultan, father of the present ruler. Sultan, after murdering his brother, took the office. Saqor, father of the above Jhiyab murdered Sultan, and held the office. Khalifa bin Zayid, by order of Shakhbut, murdered his brother Saqor, so Shakhbut bin Sultan has become the present Ruler of zibu iJhabi. He, Dhiyab, shifted to Sharjah, where he still lives, and his four brothers, Rashid, Zayid, Tahnoon and Hilal have lived at Dubai. Shaikh S akhbut has held the office of ^bu Dhabi for aoout 20 years, and Dhiyab states that he and his brothers have not been paid anything by their cousin Shakhbut inspite of their writing to him through the 20 years. Now he wants the British Government to intervene and arrange with Shaikh Shakhbut to give him and his brothers some allowance. In my opinion he has been instigated by the Dubai Shaikhs against his cousin because of the trouble between Abu ^habi and Dubai on Ghanathah. This is in internal matter between the Shaikh of nbu Dhabi and his cousins please. vt- 14 0 *71^ a)-tv.')
