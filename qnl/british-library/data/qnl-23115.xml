Regret very few Maltese available with required qualifications. Two applicants onlv identified both with limited experience. One is 51 married with adult children. Other is 22 unmarried.

Dear Sir Rupert, Residency complimentary slip July 5th. No.303/3/49 of 2. I conveyed to Allcard the contents of Cairo te legram No.9. He did not like the reference to limited experience; he said that the man of 51 was too old to bring here for the first time and the one of 22 a little young. 3. I suggested that he should send a telegram to the English Coaling Company telling them of the men Audsley had found and asking them to vet them together with any others they might know of themselves. The reason for this tail piece was that the English Coaling Company being on the Canal is doubtless closer in touch with the supply of diesel engineers than Audsley is. The Manager of the English Coaling Company is also an exceptionally sound man. 4. Allcard agreed to send the telegram but said he was not happy about the Italians. Messrs. Tommina and Uchi and Hussain Yateem had got Italians working for them and he felt that if either of them were to get more or if Italian employees were admitted in respect of other firms the position would amount to discrimination against Gray Mackenzie. 5. I think there is something in this contention. If we decline to let Gray Mackenzie have their two Italians we must, except in most exceptional circumstances, turn down any subsequent applications in respect of Italians. Even if the Shaikh were not to demur it would scarcely be in our interest to have a large Italian colony here (and I understand that there are four or five hundred Italians on the mainland who do not want to go back to Eritrea). The question is: where is the line to be drawn and as this involves a question of policy I should be grateful for your instructions.

My dear This is just to advise you that agreement has been reached with the Arabian American Oil Company that they will release two of their Italian employees for service with us. With regard to your suggestion that we should endeavour to obtain Maltese, we have written to Port Said but are not very optimistic that we shall be able to obtain suitable men willing to work in the rather rigorous conditions of Bahrein. It will be very much appreciated, therefore, if consideration is still given to our suggestion that we employ two Italians who are immediately available and, we know, are suitable for our work. 1 Yours sincerely, JEA/NGN. \ 11 /4 t-r.S•O.No.C/L-245* Political Agency, Bahrain, July 14, 1949. Dear Allcard, ' Thank you for your letter of July 13, No.L/69. 2. Before going any further into the matter of your Italians I should like to see the reply you get from Port Said when it arrives. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) H.G. Jakins. J.E. Allcard, Esq., M/s. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL . (303/5/49) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 14th July 1949. -J Your letter No.C/R-286 of the 7th July about the employment of Italians in Bahrain. I note that some Italians are already employed by local firms. I presume that no objection certificates were obtained from the Agency before they were admitted to the island and that some attempt was made to check their antecedents. This may kindly be confirmed. 2 My own view is that there is no objection to our admitting a few high grade Italian arti- sans subject to a check of their antecedents but that we should resist the import of Italian labour 6n a large scale. I should be xnclined therefore to let Gray Mackenzies have their two Italians provided they understand that although we may agree to their employing three or four more as their project develops it is unlikely we shall be willing to go beyond this. —• 1 - Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
