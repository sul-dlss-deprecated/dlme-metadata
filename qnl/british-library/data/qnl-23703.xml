DRESS HSGULATI0H8» My dear Herbert, It often happens in some parts N of Central India, and elsewhere in the plains of India, that the weather is too cold for complete white mess-kit, but not cold enough for a stiff shirt and the ordinary cloth coat with tails. For sueh occasions I suggest that blue undress oreralls with a white mess jacket is appropriate, and their use should be made optional. This would only be a recognition of a practice which I believe actually exists in many parts of India e.g. Hyderabad, Mysore, and Rajputana, Western India, as well as in this Agency. 2. The smartness of appearance of a combination of blue overalls and white jacket cannot, I think be denied, while white overalls are not only uncomfortable, but untidy, unless very well cut and carefully worn.
