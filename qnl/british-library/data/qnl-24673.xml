Mason, Political Resident, Aden, , To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Has the honour to state that he considers it necessary to forward the fol lowing letter as it contains the views of the Political Officer, Dthala. Although he does not share the pessimistic views regarding the feelings of the tribes towards the British, still he is of opinion that Major Merewether’s recommenda tion regarding stipends is sound. There is no doubt that the Amir of Dthala, owing to his unjust treatment and oppression of his subjects, has incurred their hatred. The Amir is now in Aden, and the undersigned is to have an interview with him on the 7th instant when he will speak to him on this matter and will also take the oppor tunity of ^ impressing upon him the necessity of adhering to the treaty in every particular. The undersigned does not, however, propose to ask the Amir to sign the new treaty until Government have perused the letter now forwarded and have passed their orders upon it. No. C.«8 1904, dated Dthala, the 29th October 1904. (Confidential.) From— Major W. Merewether, Political Officer, Dthala, To— Lieutenant-Colonel J. Davies, First Assistant Resident, Aden. With reference to copy of letter No. 3151-E. A., dated Simla, 22nd September 1904, from the Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, forwarded with your endorsement No. 188 of 10th October 1904, I have the honour to offer the following remarks for the consideration of the Besident. 2. In paragraph 2 of the letter, the following sentence occurs “ the wis dom of the direct grant of stipends to a tribe such as the Kotaibi, who are de pendents of the Amir of Dthala, seems, moreover, to be exceedingly doubtful.” It is true that the Kotaibis are nominally dependents of the Amir of | Dthala. They do not, however, acknowledge his suzerainty and, were it not for the presence of our troops in the Amir’s country, they would undoubtedly take active steps to prove their independence, steps which I have little doubt 1 would prove successful. tu.i ^ wil ] n -° W giVG ? brief de8Cri P tion of the present position of the Amir of Dthala and or the Kotaibi. The Amir has never occupied so strong a position as he does at the present moment. This, howevdr, is solelv due to the presence or British troops. , * His avarice, treachery and cruelty have made his name a bv-word amongst even the Arabs with whom such attributes are common. He hasestranged the sympathies of practically all the tribes under his rule. Were we to withdraw, I fully believe that the Amir would have to leave his country and would be lucky if he got out alive. The only alternatives he would possess would be :— (1) To intrigue with the Turks. (2) To grant all the demands of the Kotaibis as to the levying of dues V ^ on the Haberlain and to renounce his suzerainty over them. * (3) To hire fighting men to assist him in retaining his position. His own tribes would certainly not assist him without pay, and I doubt whether they Would do so even if paid. (4) To ask our assistance. The Amir would certainly, m the first instance, ask for our assistance. He would grant all demands of the Kotaibis, for the simple reason that he is perfectly aware of his absolute inability to enforce his prohibition of their collection of dues on the Haberlain or to render his suzerainty a reality instead of a name. He would probably try to strengthen his position by intrigues with the Turks. I very much doubt whether, in the event of failure in all these directions, he would attempt to fight the matter out. He himself has more than once told me that, in the event of our withdrawing from Dthala, he would at once , make for Aden. In any case, his exchequer once exhausted, he would have to leave the country. He is so universally detested by the Arabs that there is no doubt that we have lost considerable prestige by our attempts to bolster him up, and, more over, to attempt to do so at the expense of the Kotaibis was a fatal error, having regard to the position occupied by the Kotaibis with reference to the 1 Lower Yaffai as well as the other Kudfan tribes. I can only ascribe our having done so to the fact that the country was comparatively new to us and . that accurate local knowledge was therefore difficult to obtain. 3. I would point out, with reference to the additional grant of $100 per mensem, proposed in the new treaty which is shortly to be entered into with the Amir that, relying on our presence, he has not kept up any troops what ever. He has merely a few Arabs armed with rifles numbering about fifteen. Had we not been here he would have had to maintain a force to protect his own territory without any pecuniary assistance from us. If this be contrasted with the numbers maintained by the Sultans of Lahej and Mokalla, it will be seen that the Amir has taken advantage of our presence to save money and that since our arrival in the country he has never been in a position to fulfil his treaty obligations. By this I mean that he is bound to preserve order in his territory and to assure the safety of the trade routes. If, however, he were called on suddenly to send a sufficient force at ^ once to maintain order on the route from Dthala to Sulek, which has been the most frequent scene of outrages and which is entirely within his territory, he would be absolutely unable to do so. Burther, I have ascertained that the Amir has not even sufficient authority in the actual valley of Dthala to enforce his orders, and that in order to do so, he has to threaten the people that he will get us to come and attack them if they fail to obey his orders. He has, moreover, as I have reported, deliberately broken his agreement as to the dues to be levied on goods, etc., imported from Aden to Dthala or vice versa, not only once but twice, having practically from the date on which he signed the agreement, *.e., 1888, never had the least intention of adhering to it. I have had the very greatest difficulty in inducing him to return to the scale to which he had agreed, and I have not the least doubt that he will take the very first available opportunity of again raising the scale of dues. In some cases I may mention that he was charging ten times the amount sanc tioned under the 1888 agreement. Further, it is a matter of common knowledge that the Amir has exerted himself to the utmost to prevent any reconciliation between the Kotaibis andourselves His object has been to stir up the Kotaibis to outrages on the trade country 3 t0 41611 b ® 10S Utterly crushed b y u s before we leave this _ Finding, however, that his intrigues were of no avail, and that I was on the point of receiving the submission of Mahomed Saleh, he sent his eldest son Naser, secretly, to a place on the borders of the Kotaibi country with a view to an mtemew with Mahomed Saleh. The sole object of this was undoubt- edly to forestall me and to make peace, probably on the lines of a general renunciation of all suzerain rights. * ” refused^ meef Sheik^Naser! 1 be “ S already “ Cl ° 89 uommunication ™ I have mentioned this incident and have gone into the whole question at future 8 iftheH^te’l 1 ^ U . be . one of ^^rahle importance to our tuture m the Hinterland and also with a view to illustrating the different deereec respectively Pla ° ed ° n the S ° 0d faith ° f the Amir “ dof Ma bomcd Saleh tt 4 - As re ? ards tb e position occupied by the Kotaibis amongst the tribes of the Hinterland on account of their territorial extent or numerical strength Imay say at once that it is comparatively insignificant.

The Abdul ah, « a iri the Bukri and the Dthambari would assuredly have gone against us and taking^advantage of the general confusion^ that would have ensued, the Suhaihis and Haushabis would probably have joined in. A s a result of Mahomed Saleh’s hostility, it was therefore perfectly possible, even probable, that we should have had against us the following tribes Upper and Lower Yaffais, although apparently separate, they join together against an external enemy. . . . The Kotaibis, Dthamharis, Abdulleh, Bain, Bukri, probably the Hijaihs and the Alawis, the Subaihis and the Haushabis; and it remained to he seen which side the Amir’s subjects would take. x , , , ,, 4 . fi Since my arrival in Dthala, I have given a great deal of attention to this Yaffai-Kotaibi ques tion, realizing as I did that as far as our relations with the tribes went, it was the most important point of all. I found Mahomed Saleh in a state of sullen defiance- At first he utterly declined to meet me, giving as his reason for declining that he never would see another British officer of his own free will. tt p eventually met me in his own country and a short time ago wrote to sav that, if I guaranteed his safety, he would come into oar post at Sulek and meet me there. I gave him the required guarantee and went to Sulek to meet him On arrival I found that Mahomed Saleh was seriously ill. I ascertained th“‘to be genuine. I consulted the doctor and sent him a letter giving him medical advice. He has now recovered and appears to be intensely grateful. He has asked me to meet him after Ramadhan at Sulek. 6. I trust I have shown sufficient grounds for my belief that: — j / j j qhe Kotaibis are not really dependents of the Amir at all. (2) That any arrangements we make in the direction of friendly relations with them will ultimately greatly benefit the Amir of Dthala. (3) That even supposing the Kotaibis to he dependents of the Amir, we V ^ commit no breach of faith with him in making an arrangement by which the safety of his principal trade route, which he is by treaty hound to protect, but which he has utterly failed to do, will be, as far as can he anticipated, assured. (4) That the Amir’s own attitude towards his treaty and agreements with us has been such as to forfeit all claim to consideration in a matter the result of which can only be to benefit all parties concerned. } (5) That the Kotaibi Sheikh is a factor to be very seriously considered it being remembered that the Yaffai have it indelibly fixed in i their minds that sooner or later we mean to invade their country. (6) That for the first time since the^ punitive expedition against the Kotaibis, Mahomed Saleh is willing and anxious to treat. 7. I cannot help thinking that we have made two great mistakes in this part of the country, mistakes which, unless rectified at a very early date, are likely to cause us very great trouble and expense. (a) We forced the Amir of Dthala on the Kotaibis. Left to himself much as he might have desired to do so, he would never have been rash enough to attempt to actively assert and exercise his suzerainty. The Kotaihis were the very last people with whom we ought to have in terfered in this manner, influential as their Sheikh is with the Yanai an situated as they are in a commanding position on the main route between Aden and Dthala on our lines of communication. The Kotaibis will never acknowledge the suzerainty of the Amir of Dthala. They know him too well.Unfortunately what we have done we cannot undo or it would encourage other tribes to break out in order to get us to redress their grievances. The point can, however, with care he glossed over. (6) We deprive the Kotaibis of the dues which had been levied by them on the Haberlain before our arrival and gave them nothing in return. , . With reference to my belief that the Amir was at the bottom of the Kotaib^ rising, I have just come across a letter from Major Pullen, Royal Garrison • Artillery, dated Nobat Dakim, 28th September 3903, just before the rising, addressed to General Maitland, in which the following passage occurs — . ‘‘ Captain Lloyd-Jones tells me from Sulek that the Kotaibis fired on a house m which the Alawi was staying on the night of the 26th, but did no damage. He also tells me that the Kotaibis are again restless because the Amir had promised to get permission for them to collect taxes once more, but now finds he is unable to carry out this engagement as you do not approve of such a course. ” I have no doubt whatever of the accuracy of Captain Lloyd-Jones’ infor mation on this point, as it agrees with the result of my enquiries in the same direction. The result is that we are endangering the peace of the country and the safety of the trade routes, from a feeling of consideration for the Amir as to a point on which he has himself never insisted and on which, were we to with draw, he would be the first to give way. 8. My proposals, then, are as follows:— 1. The suzerainty of the Amir having once been forced on the Kotaibis, although only in name, cannot now be dropped. It can, however, be minimized. 2. Mahomed Saleh to receive a monthly stipend of $50, his claim to the right of levying dues being in no way recognized, but in compen sation for the loss of a source of income (about I think $100 per mensem) which undoubtedly existed before our arrival and after it, i.e., till August 1903. I would not, however, suggest that we bind ourselves to pay the stipend in perpetuity, but would word the clause to this effect: “ So long as the stipend of $50 per mensem is paid by Government, • And his heirs and successors. Mahomed Saleh * to engage not to raise the . , question of dues nor to allow it to be raised on their behalf . 1 his suits our convenience, and if at any future date we wish to discontinue the stipend, we can do so without any breach of faith; the Amir of Dthala can then, if he is able, compel Mahomed Saleh not to levy dues. If he proves unable to do so, it supports my belief that our treaty with the Amir in this direction is valueless to us, as it was with a view to the suppression of disorder on the road arising from the attempts of the Kotaibis to levy dues that this clause was mainly inserted. Properly treated, I believe that the Kotaibis would prove to be our best friends in this part of the country, and that through Mahomed Saleh our difficulties in both Upper and Lower Yaffai in the future may be very greatlv diminished. J J 9. If Mahomed Saleh is granted a stipend, some of the other E ad fan tribes in the immediate neighbourhood of the direct road from Nobat to Hthala will also ask for stipends. I propose that such be granted, terminable at our pleasure to the following:— Hijaili Dthambari . Bukri $ • • . 25 per mensem. . . . 25 . . . 205 6 T shall he o’lad if this matter can he settled at as early a date as can possibly he arranged as I must meet Mahomed Saleh in the near future, and unless I can offerVm the stipend X propose, I fear that serious trouble will sooner or later arise along the whole of the lines of communication from Nobat Dakim The only possible alternative to my suggestion that I can see is to be con tinually prepared to send out a force to punish any tribes which may give trouble^ on the trade routes. This, from every point of view, is extremely undesirable until, at least, we have tried the effects of the policy which I now propose. Telegram, dat^d the 21st November 1901. From— Bombay, Political, Mahableshwar, To—Resident, Aden. Your letter No. 193, dated the 5th November. Treaty should be signed before Amir leaves Aden. [Confidential.] No. 343 M., dated Bombay Castle, the 25th November 1904. From-C. H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum No. 193 fConfidential), dated the 5th November 19 4, forwarding copy of a letter No. 0.3—1901, dated the 29th October 1901, from Major W. Merewether, the Political Officer, Dthala, on the subject of a treaty with the Amir of Dthala. 2. You have already been directed in my telegram dated the 21st liovem her 1901, to sign the treaty ; and I am now to communicate the observations which follow upon the report on the affairs of Dthala. Major Merewether s full report has had the careful attention of the Governor ^ Oou^il. The considerations urged by the Political Officer are in short that the Amir of Dthala (i) is unworthy of trust, (ii) is unpopular with his people, (m) has no means of giving effect to the treaty, and (iv) has evaded former treaty oh igar tions Major Merewether further criticises the policy of the past and points to the danger involved in what seems to him the mistake Government have made in treating the Kotaibi as subordinate to the Amir of Dthala. 3. It should he explained to the Political Officer that the Amir is, whatever his personal characteristic may be, the de facto head of the tnbesmen, subjec and P dependencies ” of Dthala; and it is with him m that capacity and so^long as he is recognised as such, that the British Go\ein ^ upon the treaty. Our obligations under the treaty hold so long ther}s his to our satisfaction, and if he is unable, m spite of x • j 1 . earnest co-operation with him, to fulfil them, or if he ceases ? 0 P? P no tion in which Government deal with him, the Governor longer be bound to pay the stipend. . 4. I am to request that you will impress strongly upon ^aj or emve er the necessity for recognising the existing situation m Arabia. ^ Dthala like other Sheikhs, is the ruler recognised by his tribesmen . and he recognised by us and treated by the Political Officer wit ue p The Political Officer seems disposed, on the strength of mformation winch appears to emanate always from the same unspecified quarter, , inference that the Amir is a man to be held at arms length and treated with suspicion. On the contrary, it would be well if }&gt; taking im fi , / Major Merewether would deal with him direct, thus gaming is 00 . , , paving the way to the exercise of that personal influence whic is ess . our position in the Protectorate. The Political Officer is of course q o.Ji. to tap all sources of information, and the foregoing remarks app y o a of all tribes, including Mahomed Saleh of the Kotaibi, with all o ^ 0 , important that the dealings should be direct and personal. Major e , seems indeed to have taken great pains to acquaint himself wit p7 situation; but the Governor in Council thinks it is advisable to caution him not % 5 t0 permit intelligence, implicating the Amir’s good faith, to interfere with his %% continued dealings, friendly, direct, constant and candid, with the Amir, 5. In conclusion, X am directed to point out how necessary it is to impress ^KU. upon the Political Officer that he should not expect impossible standards of '“'s conduct from the Arab Chiefs. The inferences hostile to the Amir which ettret- Ma 3 or Merewether draws date from the time of the Kaim Mukam’s raid. The ^Ini sources of his information are not clearly indicated; and upon these depend the value to be placed upon his conclusions. His Excellency the Governor m Council is of opinion that the Resident and the Political Officer should accord every possible courtesy and consideration to these Chiefs, who after all are rulers to their own countrymen, and should endeavour to obtain as close a personal influence over them as is possible. An attitude on the part of the Political Officer towards the Chiefs similar to that adopted by the late Captain . , , Warneford is essential. He must recognise their moral weaknesses, while ' ^ according full respect to their local importance, and endeavour, by encourao’ing frequent and direct intercourse, to influence them for the prevention of trouble.Enclosure No. 2.

Extract paragraph 2 of later from the Political Beeident, Aden, to the Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, Political Department, No. 203, dated the 3rd December 1904. * * * * * * * '* 2 -P n tlle treaty bemg read out to the Amir, he complained that the proposed stipend of 100 dollars per mensem and the further monthly subsidy ° °^ ars ^ ,^ e maintenance of a force of 50 men were small compared with the responsibilities to he undertaken by him. He also demurred at first to the separation of the stipend and the subsidy. Eventually he agreed to the revised draft treaty as approved by Government, but he pleaded that at least he should be given the rifles wherewith to arm the fifty m»n, and also two small cannons. Ihe request for the latter I am not disposed to recommend as it is not usual for Government to present the Chiefs with cannon. But as to the rifles, we might perhaps give the Amir half the number required, though considering the benefits he has reaped by the demarcation of the frontier and the enhanced stipend and additional subsidy now proposed to be given he should not expect further assistance from Government. *TREATY WITH THE AMIR OF DTHALA The British Government and the Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan, the ruler of D’thala, and all its dependencies, having determined to firmly establish the relations of peace and friendship so long existing between them. ° The British Goyerment have named and appointed Major-General Henry Macan Mason, Political Resident at Aden, to conclude a Treaty for this purpose.

The said Amir of D’thala and other notable persons shall visit Aden when they please. They shall be treated with respect and be given passes to carry arms. II. In compliance with the wish of the aforesaid Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan, the British Government hereby undertake to extend to the territory of D’thala and all its dependencies the gracious favour and protec tion of His Majesty the King, Emperor. ^ III. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan hereby agrees, and promises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and the whole of the tribes men, subjects and dependents, under his jurisdiction, to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement or treaty with any foreign nation or Power; and further promises to give immediate notice to the Resident at Aden, or other British Officer, of any attempt, by any other power, to interfere with the territory of D’thala or any of its dependencies. IV. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan hereby binds him self, and his heirs and successors, for ever, that they will not cede sell mortgage, lease, hire, or give, or otherwise dispose of, the territory of D’thala 5 and its dependencies, or any other part of the same, at any time to any power other than the British Government. v. y The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan further promises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and all his tribesmen, subjects and dependents, that he will keep open the roads in the territory of D’thala and its dependencies, and that they wall protect all persons who may be going in the direction of Aden for the purposes of trade, or returning therefrom. VI. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan also engages, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and all his tribesmen, subjects anddependents to maintain the boundary which has been demarcated by the joint British and Turkish Commission, and to protect the boundary pillars.

IX. To assist him in carrying out the obligations imposed by this Treaty the said Amir on behalf of himself and his successors, engages to maintain a force of 50 men, or such less number as the Resident may agree to. So long as this force is maintained in a state of efficiency to the satisfaction of the Resident, the British Government agree to pay to the said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Abdul Hadi bin Hasan, and to his successor or successors, a monthly sum of one hundred (100) dollars, the half of which is fifty (50) dollars, this subsidy to be in addition to that mentioned in Article VIII.

The proposal is intended to be purely experimental and, if it is found that the dispensary is poorly attended, it will be discontinued. F * 2. His Excellency the Governor in Council, as reported in my letter above quoted, considers that the establishment of a hospital and dispensary for the treatment of all who may come in to the head-quarters of the Political Officer at D thala is highly desirable. Should the Government of India consider that the present proposals are an adequate commencement of such a scheme, I am also to request that sanction may be accorded to the payment of £.30 for the instruments which, it is here reported, have been privately purchased by Captain II. E. Jacob, the Political Officer at D thala, for his suggested dispensary. Memorandum on a Civil Dispensary proposed tentatively for D'thala-Aden Hinterland. The Political Officer at D thala has been directed to give moral support to the Amir of D thala and to keep in touch with the Upper Xafa country in view to a possible demarcation in that direction. To that end we employ the following means I.—Personal intercourse-, not necessarily with the Chiefs or recognized heads of tribes and sections only, but with the tribesmen them selves, both at D’thala head-quarters, but more especially in their own country. The importance of the personal factor cannot be exaggerated. II.—Discriminate distribution of presents in cash and kind. This a^ain is done less at head-quarters than in the districts where we ensure the monies reaching the many and deserving cases. The tribesmen are democrats pure and simple, and have all a hand in the direction of their affairs, the Sheikh or Akil being often times a mere figure head who holds his position at the will of his tribesmen. The with holding of gifts at head-quarters. {a) Ensures an entrance into the different villages the starting point, whence to secure the tribal confidence. (b) Terminates the jealousies formerly existing between a Sheikh and his tribesmen where the former pocketed the money, and the latter looked on. In dealing with Bedouins and wild tribes money awards are imperative. III.— Medical treatment. —The other means have their relative importance, but I would specially in this memorandum labour this means of reach ing the people D’thala itself presents an object-lesson on the necessity of some institution to cope with the distress chronic in these parts. With the scarcity now prevalent in Yemen we have an inroad of starvelings—men, women and children from Turkish limits. I do not pretend they are chiefly sick people. Many of them are not.We hare, however, to pay for the advent, 100 mile, into the country, of our beneticent methods of administration, so that the whole country-side, including sufferers from our own sphere of influence, such the Upper and Lower Yafa countries, and also those beyond, „ Khaulan Marib, etc., who claim to be independent peoples,^ owi’ne no allegiance to the Turks, is coming into D thala for treatment. Our military hospitals with their specific duties and limited supplies cannot possibly alleviate the distress, and consequently many remain ■unattended. There is at Sana in Turkish Arabia, some eight days’ journey from D’thala a milit^y hospital well-equipped, it is said but not intended to administer to the want of their civil population. From a political point of view we are not at first sight keenly interested in ir , 1. v nuF OW n neon e there can be no doubt as to the these people of Yemen.

If. after that time, Government are dis satisfied on the ground of the paucity of attendants, the proposal need not be longer entertained. Politically! and on the score of humanity, 1 feel confident that the outlay will be richly remunerative. If a doubt is felt, we cannot do better than put the proposal to a test. Personally, well assured of the urgency of my P lan &gt; J have arranged, on my own responsibility, and privately, for the purchase of the instruments, &amp;c., wfthout which no such institution can be initiated. Their cost is some £30 Government will be relieved of this expense. The local firms with head- quarters at Aden will generously contribute donations. I attach on sheet marked “A” a monthly estimate of expenses. These have been medically checked both locally and by Dr. J. C.

Some measures for treating the starving sick in this place are absolutely imperative. I would urge the necessity of making a beginning at once in anticipation of Government sanction. In my letter No. Ill, dated 2nd April last, I have sketched a plan which it was recommended should be given a four months’ trial. I do not now ask to inaugurate any treatment on eren so small a scale as that, but I have put up two condemned E. P. tents to serve as a hospital. I have daily applications for treatment, chiefly ulcer cases. These I send to Captain McPherson, I. M. S., S. M. O. Operations are often necessary, and afterwards the patients are sent to me till convalescent, when they are dis charged. Daily dressings are requisite, and for this purpose a hospital assistant (Sd.) H. F. JACOB, Captain t Political Officer, D’thala, No. 206, dated the 22 nd May 3905.is daily deputed by the Senior Medical Officer. The patients are rationed while in our care at 4 annas per diem. It is impossible to send these cases away with out treatment. Where will they go ? Humanity and political expediency demand we shall treat these unfortunates. I am devoting to this end the Rs. 600 you lately sent me. Everything is being done on strictly economical lines. Famine and war are responsible for this Yemeni invasion of our parts.

I have the honour to forward a memorandum on this subject drawn up by Captain H. P. Jacob, now at D’thala as Political Officer. 3. Captain Jacob urges that the raison d’etre for our presence is to afford moral support to the Amir at D’thala and to keep in touch with the Yafai. 4. To this I would add that it is also to maintain peace on and within our own borders. 5. This can in my opinion be only now effected by retaining at D’thala an officer whose advice and^ guidance will enable the Amir of D’thala to discharge the “ territorial and international responsibilities vis-a-vis the Turks” which we have incurred by the recent demarcation of the Frontier. 6. I am moreover convinced that were the Political Officer to he withdrawn from D’thala before the Amir has thoroughly established his position over the Kotaibai and the Sha’iri tribes a condition of affairs would arise which would entail the expenditure of much money and of many lives to subsequently rectify, and would be a serious blow to our prestige. 7. I have recently visited D’thala and although a great improvement is apparent in the relations between the Amir and his people, still it is evident that amongst those sections which have only recently been restored to his authority the Amir is not yet popular. I agree w T ith Captain Jacob that a reconciliation can be looked forward to, but it must be a matter of time and to a great extent the work of a Political Officer personally known to and trusted by both parties. 8. Much good work has been done and much more can easily be effected in tbe near future if an influence for good is continued to be felt, to the direct advantage to the Chief and people and indirectly to our own benefit. 9. The area of land under cultivation has recently increased. The roads are much safer than they were. A demand has arisen, mainly owing to our presence in the country, for goods with which the people were before un acquainted or which they were unable to procure. 10. A Railway from Aden to Nobat Dakim at the foot of the hills is under consideration. A road from Nobat Dakim to D’thala will shortly be commenced, which will become the main caravan route for trade from the Yafai country and South Yemen through D’thala to Aden, and will probably result in old roads being improved, and new tracks being developed throughout the country. I hope that a Sanatarium for the benefit of the Aden Garrison will soon be established in the vicinity of D’thala. i ; 11. Captain Jacob has written “ commerce on free and secure lines will tend more than anything else to ensure the prosperity of the Hinterland.” It will further tend to peace as it always has done elsewhere in the world. 12. But commerce cannot be thoroughly developed nor the peace of the country ensured until we have established friendly intercourse with all the tribes under our protection, some of whom from want of real . knowledge still regard us with suspicion, if not actual animosity. 13. As the influence of the Political Officer spreads these doubts will be removed: in a few years we may hope that our Protectorate will be as safe as Burma as now become. 14. Captain Jacob has referred to an escort for the Political Officer. 15. So long as there are troops at D’thala it will be unnecessary to make special arrangements in this connection. Even if the troops now at D’thala i Pol 992—— 2 be transferred to a more healthy situation on the Jihaf Mountain above D’thala, a detachment can be furnished for the Political Officer. The question of a Tribal Levy has yet to be considered. It may presently be found possible to form such a Corps, recruited from all the tribes under our protection, raised on somewhat similar lines to the guides under Lumsden. 16. For the sake of the country and in our^ own interests 1 strongly ^ recommend that a Political Officer be retained at 1) thala. # Reasons for permanently maintaining a Politieil Officer and Ms escort at D’tfiala, l The raison d’etre of our stay in the Hinterland is to afford moral support to the Amir of D'thala and to keep in touch with the countr/ of Upper Yafai in view of a possible demarca tion of the Turkish Border. So it has been declared. 2. Taking DYhala and its Amir first: it is inadvisable to recede till such time as the Amir’s position is secure. He has been subjected c ironically to Turkish pin-pricks while we were located 100 miles distant. The Turks have been too recently ejected from places between ITthala and the frontier to forget theso were once in their possession. Once our back was turned, history would repeat itself and that in spite of, or, perhaps, because of, defined boundaries. \ 3. Take, again, the constant fighting between Turks and Imam. If it continue and no Political Officer be present on the scene, intrigues will be rife and we shall never know the extent to which our Sultans and Chiefs are participating. 4. If, on the other hand, a compromise were effected we might, not inconceivably, witness a disturbance of existing spheres of influence and a redistribution of terrain of a kind to render some alteration in the boundary and the creation of a commerce, perhaps, with the Imam direct. Whilst all this is in the air, I strongly deprecate any policy of retrogression. 5. Further, the Amir’s relations with his tribesmen and feudatories are still not of the best. The powerful section of the Radfan tribes—the Kotaibi — would undoubtedly give him trouble, if removed. The Sha’iri tribe whose habitat is chifly between D’thala and the Turkish Frontier have not become reconciled to him because of Turkish intrigue there in the past. My aim is to effect this reconciliation which is not possible except gradually. I am eonfideat of success ia course of time. These Sha iri villages were lately in Turkish occupation and it is here where iurkish intrigue will recommence, as we are marching back to Aden. To use force against the Sha’iris is what would please the Amir, but I have shown him that acts of repression will not care the sore, more especially were we the actors. Absolutely dependent on us, he would collapse completely when we could no longer act as his prop. There would forthwith begin a reign of vengeance. 6. I need not enlarge upon the lo^s of our prestige were we thus to bolster up an unpopular Ruler and pose before his tribesmen as associated with his cause as against theirs. We could not better ensure mal-Government. 7. My policy is to keep myself in the back ground, to prompt and suggest salutary measures remembering that reform must perforce take root slowly which measures the Chief, working along the lines of least resistance, will himself bring into practice and for which he will receive all the credit. This system is necessarily a slow one. To hasten it would be its min. It requires time to perfect it, and it is the sole satisfactory system. It calls for supervision on the spot. 8. My work here is impliedly frontier. I would invite attention to the misleading nature of this term. There can be no purely frontier work without peace and quiet within that frontier. Work on the Frontier argues rest at our backs. We must first work up to a frontier before we can localise our duties there. This we have still to do. I do not say the Hinterland is restless. My meaning is that we know too little of it; have not as yet stamped our likeness on its peoples. There is too little of the personal factor ” introduced amongst the tribesmen, and it is therefore idle merely to watch the Turks in our front. I am no advocate of itervention in purely tribal affairs but of disinterested advice with a view to development of trade and sympathetic intercourse with the people, 9. If this is true of the border nearer to D’thala, how much more so in relation to Upper Yafai, Bedtha and Behan. If an agreemeat has been effected and the delimitation has been agreed upon, the practical demarcation still remains. We know but little of the Upper Yal;4i tribes. .Lately they were at d’alliance wit a the Turks and t.vo of the Sultans in receipt of Turkish stipends. 10. From my experience of its Sultans who are Legion I must record my opinion that we have not made an altogether judicious selection of our nominees to stipends and there are many men of note there still discontented. We cannot leave the Hinterland with Upper ¥afhi h* tQ ^ 6 7 8 9 10 condition. Our withdrawal will spell instant and constant intrigue. Upper Yafhi s secret relations with the Imam, in the event of the compromise to which I have above alluded, is a factor not to be minimised. These tracts were all once the Imam’s.{ « U V I . W ? ld J n0 ‘ T ? 08e my i repo ' t 1 without allu3!on to trade potentialities, all in embryo, of the Hinterland. It seems to me that our closer political relations should be chiefly utilised towards fostering its trade. Commerce on free and secure lines will tend more than anything else to ensure the prosperity of the Hinterland. A railway, good roads, knowledge of the various trade-routes—all these require tune to elaborate. ° Th « U PP« Yafdi trade is, I believe, considerable. Ad en does not receive a tithe of its produce. It must be going elsewhere or withering for want of stimulus. The imports into Aden of coffee have greatly diminished of late, and we cannot ascribe the diminution to drought solely. ° 4 - v, ^ i t ^ ie , ?°^ en opportunity to detail a special olficer, possessing the requisite technical knowledge, to come up and study the Hinterland trade. The Aden Chamber of theoS C a e ily might ^ addreSSed • 1 believe the raatter has been considered, so far only 14. To sum up: I do not think the time is mature for an evacuation of this country. As a matter or fact we know too little about it and its possibilities to accurately gauo-e the position. In a year or two we shall be better able to discuss the pros and eons. J &amp; ° 15. We have put our hand to the plough and should not look back, till we leave an indelible impression on the country and generate a desire for self-improvement and progress. Uur dealings with the distant tribes have been carried on for 60 years by proxy. This policy 5 may still be pursued, in part, with advantage. We cannot afford to kick away the ladder up which we have climbed. A new era, however, has begun and we shall incur great loss of prestige, it we retrace our steps Adenwards, and shall, also, cut ourselves adrift from vast 80 urces°of hrst-hand knowledge of a country which promises to engage the attention, should Turkish influence decline, of nations other than ourselves. * fy nothing of a possible permanent Sanitarium for British troops at D’thala or on Jabal Jahaf. It is a matter rather for Military considerations. 17. As to personnel should Government elect to hold their ground, it is inexpedient to leave the Political Officer all at once without some escort larger than the present one of 21 Aden Troopers. Nor should he be bereft of guns. 18. ^ If the Indian troops are recalled, the question of the occupation of posts on the lines of communication will come up for settlement. Little difficulty will be experienced save in the matter of Sulek and Hardaba. 19* The question of the ownership of these places is still unsettled and is a delicate one likely to cause a considerable amount of bad blood. Ownership is one thing; another as important, is the expediency of ensuring that the strongest party shall come into the possession of places along which trade moves. The solution may best lie in the adoption of a system of mixed tribal levies—and the general introduction of levies is a matter worth careful consideratioa. ^0.' I am just now going by invitation into the Kotaibi country and will again report on this subject which will include a discussion of the relations between the Amir and his tribesmen, and how best to devise a course by which security along the trade-routes in that quarter can be permanently guaranteed. At present it is solely our presence in DThala that constrains the wilder of the Radfan tribes. Left to themselves, the history of the Kotaibis, since we knew them in 1881, has been a record of temporary inaction alternating with more frequent reprisals and caravan raidings. Our departure at this time would be the signal for the ebullition of feelings only temporarily under restraint. 21. Finally it is work within, and up to, the border to which pre-eminence should be given. As local officer in touch with tribal opinion and feeling, I hope that Grovernment will resolve that the time is not ripe for any radical change of policy, but will rather elect, as indeed a consensus of tribal opinion will wish, “ to enlarge the place of our tents, to lengthen the cords and strengthen the stakes.” H.

My Lord, 1 i/ I have consider your letter No. 130 (Secret, External^on the Treaty arrangements with the ® UbjeCt ° f the rCTis!on of our Amir of THhala. treaty arrangements with the Amir of Dthala. 2 In my Despatch No. 15 (Secret), of the 1st April last, I indicated a , m my view, Bntisli interference with the tribes of ? the Aden Hinterland should be restricted to the minimum necessitated by the o igations towards the Turkish Government arising from the demar cation of the boundary. In my subsequent Despatch No. 30 (Secret), o the 15th July last, I again expressed my views upon this subject, pointing out that the protection of the trade routes was one of the duties common to all the tribes which the British Government must be prepared to enforce. I have considered the proposals now submitted for my approval subject to these considerations. 3. The draft, except in certain particulars to which I will refer later, appears to me to be consistent with the principles indicated in my Despatches referred to above. Articles I. and V. appear to embody, with some additional detail, the provisions of the existing agreement with the Amir. Articles II„ III., and IV. are analogous to the Protectorate Treaties with the other tribes. To articles VI., VII., VIII., and X., I see no objection. There remains Article IX. 4. With regard to this Article, while I approve your proposal to earmark a monthly sum of 100 dollars for the maintenance by the Amir of a force to assist him in carrying out the obligations imposed on him by the treaty, I see no reason for relieving the Amir from the respon sibility for the use to be made of this force, nor for placing it at the disposal of the Resident. The words “ to be employed in such manner and at such place as the Resident may desire” should therefore be omitted, and in order to ensure the proper application of the stipend granted for this purpose, it should be stipulated that the stipend is to be paid “ so long as this force is maintained in a state of efficiency to the satisfaction of the Resident.” S. 38.5 4 . Copy of Article IX., showing the alterations which I consider desirable is enclosed. Subject to these modifications I approve the draft Treaty. 6 . You further propose, as a temporary measure, to retain a British officer and a small body of troops at Dthala. You explain that, for the purposes of demarcation of the frontier to the north-east, it is essential that a British officer should keep in touch with the Upper Yaffai and other tribes in that direction ; and that it is necessary, at any rate for a time, to give the Amir of Dthala moral support and guidance in carrying out the obligations placed upon him by the demarcation of his territory. I accept the proposal, but I desire that after the expiry of one year you will report if there still remains any real necessity for maintaining an officer and his escort at Dthala.

The British Government and the Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan, tae ruler of Dthala, and all its dependencies having determined to firmly establish the relations of peace and friendship so long existing between them. The British Government have named and appointed Major-General Pelham James Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, to conclude a treaty for this purpose. The said Major-General Pelham James Maitland, C.B., and the Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan aforesaid, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles :— I. There shall be peace and friendship between the British Government and all the tribesmen, subjects and dependents of the Amir of Dthala.

SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Sir, Simla, the 21st July 1904. We have the honour to address you regarding the revision of our treaty engagements with the Amir of Dthala. The only agreement which we at present hold from this Chief is that concluded on the 1st of May 1881, and the stipend of 100 dollars per annum which the Chief at present enjoys is less than that allowed to any other Chief in the Aden Hinterland. 2. In January 1904, in reply to a letter from Major-General Maitland urging the grant to the Amir of an increased stipend and the revision of posals for a new Convention and, as a temporary measure, to show to the Amir special favour in the form of Durbar presents up to a maximum value of 50 dollars a month less his ordinary stipend. We now have the honour to enclose, for your information, a copy of the correspondence on the subject, and, in view of the importance of certain of the issues which have been raised, we think it right to refer the matter for the orders of His Majesty’s Government before arriving at a final decision. 3. With his letter of the 2nd April,f General Maitland has forwarded of Article 5 are similar to those adopted in the treaties concluded with other Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, and call for no special comment. The latter half of Article 5 binds the Chief to maintain at Sulek or other place or places a post of 50 men. Articles 6 and 7 impose upon the Amir the international obligations contemplated in your Secret despatch No. 15, dated the 1st April 1904, requiring him to maintain the boundary and to protect the pillars which have been fixed by the British and Turkish Commissioners, to preserve order within his territories, and to restrain his subjects from disturbances beyond his frontier. In consideration of all these undertakings, the Resident proposes to pay to the Amir a stipend of 100 dollars monthly. 4. We consider the draft treaty to be suitable, and the only modification which we would introduce is in respect of the force which the Chief should maintain. Instead of allocating this body of men to any particular trade route, we would require the Chief to keep it up as the nucleus of a force to be used, where and when required, in accordance with the Resident s advice, for the maintenance of the Amir’s position and the fulfilment of his various obligations under the treaty, and we would grant an additional subsidy of 100 dollars per mensem to be specially ear-marked for this purpose. We consider this arrangement preferable to that proposed by the Bombay Government of simply increasing the stipend of 100 dollars pci mensem which * Enclosure No. 2. his treaty engagements, we authorised* the Political Resident to submit pro- f Sub-enclosure to enclosure No. 7. the draft of a new agreement with the Amir.

In the past we have granted the entirety of the stipends ; Jdin the Aden Hinterland in consideration of obligations of a general t l lml without insisting on the provision of any definite means of fulfilling +h^fnd^wtakinss given. H cannot be said that this system has been altogether successful Dcspfte the considerable stipends which we have paid to the several S order has not been preserved; outrages have disturbed the security of the trade routes; our officers have been unable to enter tribal territory without a strong escort or heavy payment for the right of passage, and ve have had to remain in that ignorance of tribal affairs which has been such a severe handicap throughout the recent delimitation proceedings. We cannot L™ to correct all these evils at once, but we now appear to have a specially favourable opportunity of taking, in the case of at least one section o the tribe' and on one of the most important trade routes, a step which we believe to he in the right direction, and which we hope may render it unnecessary to consider further for the present the proposals which have been put forward fo r the maintenance of tribal levies under the supervision of British officers. 5 It will be seen from the correspondence that it has been suggested that the new agreement should bind the Amir, if and when required, to furnish land for the location of a sanitarium and for the construction of a railway within his territories, and also to receive a Political Officer. We agree, however, that, ms xeintuin, , ^ tbe reas0]ls men tioned by General f Sub-enclosure to enclosure No. 7. Maitland in bis lettert of the 2nd April 1904, it would he iuadvisable to include these provisions. _ Although, however, we do not propose to make any explicit stipulation in the treaty as to the reception of a Political Officer, we concur with the Resident that it 1 is necessary to retain for the present an officer and a small body of troops f at Dthala. It is understood that General Maitland is satisfied that Lieutenan I Merewether, an officer of the Bombay Political Service, is qualified for he post, and the services of Mr. Bury, who has an intimate knowledge ot Arab life and language, will also probably be available to the Resident for gene work at Aden and in the Hinterland. A British force is at the pre*nt mome nt quartered at this spot, tbe Amir is declared to be reconciled o of its r emaining there, and tbe Uesident believes that be would be aver ^L , withdrawal. General Maitland’s proposal has tbe support of ^ Colonel wanao and Mr. Fitzmaurice, and also of Mr. Bury and the late Captain Warne o * seems to us unlikely that the proposal made by tbe Bombay Governmen o * p a special officer with bis head-quarters at Aden and a roving commissio travel as occasion may arise is likely to prove an efficient substitute or measure advocated, until affairs in the Hinterland have settled the unrest, which we understand at present to exist, has subsided. e P ' of non-interference in tbe affairs of the Hinterland has resulted, as t e r P of the Boundary Commission show, in a serious loss of territory to e &gt; and tbe ignorance of tbe true tribal border which^ this P°kf V q a :j probably responsible for tbe establishment of a Turkish post at Sliei • If we are to defer the actual demarcation of tbe frontier nortn-eas desert, it is essential that a Political Officer should, for some time to ^ ’ in close touch with the Yaffai and tribes in that direction, so as to , ' # position to ascertain what their real boundaries are, in case at any time cation is forced upon us. It must be remembered also that by the dem ? r ^ of a boundary across a cultivated plain above^ Dthala, we have m territorial and international responsibilities vis a vis tbe Turks, an i be hardly fair to the Amir to leave him to discharge these without a a y ^ at first giving him tbe moral support and guidance that such °r ice afford. For the present, therefore, we would retain at ^ Dthala a ^ force and a Political Officer, who would also watch affairs as t e y down and advise, as the result of an intimate acquaintance and ot a p ^ experience, which have not previously been available, as to the best ^ ^ conducting our future relations not only with the Amir and bis subjects, ^ with other sections of the tribes.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Mr. Russell’s letter No. 2114 E.-A., dated the 7th September 1903, I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 292, dated the 26th October 1903, from the Political Resident, Aden, in further explana tion of proposals for the increase of the stipend of the Amir of Dthala and the grant of a salute to that Chief. 2. I am to say that His Excellency the Governor of Bombay while agree ing with General Maitland as to the ultimate necessity for increasing the Amir’s stipend, probably so as to make it equal to that now drawn by the Subaihi Sultan, is still of the opinion that the time has not arrived for putting such proposals into effect. 3. I am, however, to suggest that, until the time is ripe for negotiation of a treaty, the Resident may advantageously be authorised to show to the Amir special favour in the form of “ Darhar presents” up to a maximum value of 50 dollars per mensem less his ordinary stipend. No. 292, dated Camp Dtbala, the 26th October 1903. From— Major-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Hon’ble Mr. S. W. Edgerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment Bombay, Political Department. With reference to the correspondence forwarded with your No. 6240, dated 18th September 1903, I regret that in proposing by telegraph an increase to the stipend of the Amir of Dthala I should have taken action which has been regarded as precipitate and inappropriate. I would, however, venture very respectfully to submit that considerably greater importance attaches to this matter than has so far been recognised, and I am the more sorry that I did not, in the first instance, take the ordinary course of putting forward my proposals by letter, with a full explanation. 2 Stipends are not granted to Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate for their personal enrichment, but in order to enable them to maintain their position, and to secure the good behaviour of their subordinate Sheikhs by the presents and entertainment which play so large a part in social and political life in Southern Arabia. Almost every Sheikh expects to get something from his superior and to he well entertained, according to the Arab fashion, whenever he visits' his Chief. In like manner every Akil, or elder, of a section, or sub tribe expects entertainment, together with his followers, from his immediate superior If presents are not made by superiors to subordinates, or if enter tainment is withheld, or not given on a fitting scale, there is much discontent, and the Sultan, or Sheikh, who fails to carry out the obligations which custom imposes loses not only popularity, but also influence. Very serious troubles and dissensions may ensue if subordinate Chiefs are not treated by their suzerains in what they consider a fitting manner. 3 is already explained (my No. 324, dated 2nd August 1903), many Chiefs are heads of confederacies rather than tribes. These confederacies are held together by custom, mutual advantage, and respect for the family of the paramount Chief, which has sometimes been in power for many generations. But “f course, they are not so closely united as a tribe of one blood, and m such cases the personal’ influence and prestige of the Chief is a very powerful factor ^maintaining order and cohesion. The Amin is an example of a Chiefship maT UP of a large number of small clans. The Amiri proper, or immediate dependents of the Amir of Dthala, are few in number, and they are practically f ' ■ %k ti if 12 ,, who pay him any revenue whatever. But he is the acknow- edU 6hiS of a wide P extent of' country, comprising the territory of the Az?aki Mehrahi, Ahmadi, Ilumedi, Dakkam and Sham tribes; also the group of small clans known collectively as the A1 l 3 ud which includes the trouhlesome Kotaihi. As long as we have a considerable force at Dthala, and our money flows into the country, these people will keep quiet. But when the ?ioo^ are reduced to the Political Officer’s escort, or possibly withdrawn ah to^etLr old dissensions will be renewed, and old intrigues revived. The Amir wm then require to exercise much tact as well as firmness in dealing with his rubo dinate Chiefs, and in my humble opinion it is certaiTfly necessary that he should be in a position to behave towards them with liberality. It is not pos- sible that he could do this unless he receives some greater assistance from Government than a stipend amounting to no more than Us. 11 or 12 per 4 It is my belief that a very considerable portion of ^ the difficulties the Amir has had with certain of his Sheikhs arose from his inability to pay them ^11 sums from time to time. If he had been able to do so, I think it highly probable that the Turks would not have made good their footing m various parts of his country; and, further, the trouble we have lately had with the Kotaibi Sheikh (who claims the right to levy dues on the road) would not have arisen if the Amir could have made him a small monthly payment. 5 I would also venture to observe that within the last four months three treaties with the principal Chiefs of the Yafiai have been approved, and a fourth (with Sultan Kahtan) has just been concluded and submitted for ratifi cation In none of these cases is the stipend granted with the treaties less than 40 dollars a month, or 480 dollars per annum. These amounts are not excessive, m fact they are moderate, but they bulk very largely m the eyes of the people wffien contrasted with the 100 dollars per annum allowed to the Amir; and it will doubtless be said by the Arabs, who are quick to make com parisons, that we are more generous to our new fnends than to ouroM allies. ^ The status of the Amir is certainly higher than that of the Shiekhs of the Dthubi and Muflahai. I consider him as the equal in rank of the Nakibs of the Mausata, and he has certainly more difficulty in keeping up his position. 6. I ask, therefore, for an increased stipend for the Amir, of equal amount to that granted to the Mausata, and proposed for Sultan Kahtan as a part of our policy on this frontier. This step is, in my opinion, a most important means of maintaining peace in the Amiri country, and closing the door to Turkish intrigues. I should also be glad to see the Amir honoured with a salute ot seven guns, to mark our appreciation of his behaviour, and the good sense and self-restraint he has exhibited during the past two years. The grant of a salute would also be politic as raising him in the eyes of the neighbouring Yemen Arabs, and as vindicating his position vis a vis with the Turks, who have con sistently endeavoured to belittle it in every way possible. 7. I venture, with the utmost respect, to strongly deprecate postponement of the consideration of the increase to the Amir’s stipend until the general examination of our needs and responsibilities, after the demarcation is over. This would delay the matter for a year, perhaps two, and in the meantime many difficulties might, and probably will, arise which the present bestowal ol a reasonable subsidy on the Amir would obviate. The proposed grant of a salute may be deferred for discussion till after the conclusion of the demarcation, if Government so please, but not, I trust, the stipend. 8. I would point out that the Amiri frontier may be regarded as settled already, except in detail, and I submit that no awkward precedent can be created by my proposal. I append a table showing the stipends now paid to all the Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate. The Amir is at the very bottom of the list. The Chiefs, who, together with the Amir of Dthala, stand in the nearest relation to us, are the Haushabi, the Abdali, and the Eadthli. Their stipends are already very much higher than that which I have proposed for the Amir, the lowest being nearly three times as great. Even the little Akrabi Sultan gets 40 dollars a month and the Subaihi sections 25 to 40 dollars, three t3 { imi Its to four times as much as the Amir’s present stipend. The Alawi Sheikh, who is quite a small Chief, far inferior to the Amir in rank and position, also receives three times as much. The Amir’s subsidy is so much below the ordinary level that, so far as the fear of creating a precedent is concerned, it may very safely be raised to the sum which I have proposed, viz., 50 dollars per mensem. 9. If the grant of an increased stipend be approved, the Amir should, in return, accept a protectorate treaty. I think it is very desirable that a treaty of this nature should be concluded with him as soon as possible. His present agreement with the British Government relates only to the protection of the roads, and he is not at the present moment in any way bound to maintain the frontier we are obtaining for him at so great a cost. 10. Finally, with regard to the observation in paragraph 3 of Mr. Bussell’s letter No. 2114 E.-A., dated 7th September 1903, I would explain that though the Amir can have no legitimate grievance on account of the fact that Kataba and other outlying districts will not be included in his territories, yet the Boundary Commission formally proposed to claim these places in his behalf, and this seems to have become known to him. When I arrived here in August, he was fully persuaded that they would sooner or later be handed over. I have endeavoured to disabuse him of this idea, but I have no doubt that when Kataba and Yubi and Haiki are definitely left to the Turks, he will feel disappointment, which may not be the less acute because it is unreasonable. Government does not, perhaps, always realise how different is our position with regard to the Chiefs in this country from what obtains in India, and how dependent w r e are, and always must be, on their good-will and co-operation in carrying out any policy whatever, even although it may be altogether for their benefit. An increase to the Amir’s stipend is, as I have endeavoured to show, very desirable on the ground of general policy, and perhaps of justice, and if this be admitted, it can hardly be inadvisable to bestow the gift at a time it will produce the greatest effect.

I am directed to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a confidential letter No. 333, dated the 18th December 1903, from the Political Resident, Aden, and of its enclosures, submitting proposals for the permanent posting, in future, of a Political Officer at Dthala, and for the enrolment of levies to patrol the frontier of the Aden Hinterland as it is demarcated. 2. I am to state that any remarks the Bombay Government may desire to make in this connection will be submitted hereafter. No. 333, dated Aden, the 18th December 1903 (Confidential). From— Major-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. The delimitation of the boundary of the territories under the Amir of Dthala is now approaching completion, and I venture to think that the time has arrived when it is necessary to consider the arrangements that should he made for the maintenance of the line which has been demarcated with so much labour and at so large an expenditure of money. 2. As the first and most essential point, I would submit that one of the Assistant Political Residents at Aden should be, in future, permanently stationed at Dthala, or in its neighbourhood, to watch, and, ^ if necessary, to control, under the direction of the Resident, affairs in that neighbourhood. I am decidedly of opinion that without a British officer on the spot there would soon be an active renewal of Turkish intrigue and encroachment, and that very undesirable complications, not only with the Turks, but with the local tribes, would almost certainly ensue. 3. Our general policy would, of course, be to support the Amir, while maintaining good relations with the Yaffai and other tribes beyond his sphere of influence, and with the Turkish officials at Kataba. I have elsewhere explained the position of the Amir as the head of a confederacy, rather than the chief of a tribe, and some of its difficulties. If Government are pleased to • Resident’s ietter No. SS 2, detea the26th October grant Amir Shaif the increased stipend 1903 . which I have suggested,* I think he will do well, under the advice of a Political Officer. But without a respectable stipend, and the support of a British officer on the spot, I am afraid the will not be able to prevent his country again becoming disorganised under the influences which the Turks will certainly bring to bear. 4. The Political Officer will require an escort, the^ strength of which may, perhaps be varied from time to time, according to circumstances, and which may be^artly composed of convalescent British soldiers and men recommended by the medical authorities in Aden for a change of air. 5. I have all along been of opinion that something in the form of a local levy would be required to patrol the demarcated line, to inform the Political Officer of any attempts at encroachment, and^ to see that the boundary pillars are not thrown down. Such a levy would also increase our hold over the tribes, and be useful to the Political Officer in a variety of ways. After several dis cussions on the subject with Captain Warneford, at present Political Officer at Dthala, and also with Mr. Bury, I directed the former to draw up a memo randum on the formation of a levy for the Amin and Shailn frontier alone, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. If, and when, the Haushabi and Subaihi borders are demarcated, the levy would have to be increased in proportion to the extent of the demarcated line, and the probabilities of encroachment from the Turkish side.

Hi r T pntirely a^ree with the proposals in the memorandum, which are on „ . „■ V n f pmnlovmst men of each clan in the neighbourhood, about half iSiatfly on the border. The strength of the levy has been placed as low as possible, and I hope that 40 men for a generally hd y TZdZt 00 miles will not be considered excessive. They will be fairly hard worked! as half of them will be continually on the move The rates of nav are the smallest that will he accepted by respectable tribesmen. Less uav if taken at all, would only procure slaves and riff-raff who would be untrustworthy, and who, from their inferior position, would be likely to get into trouble with the people through whom the line runs. 7 The memorandum states most of the conditions of service in the levy The entertainment of the men would be in the hands of the officer iu chuV-e but dismissal would require the approval of the Resident. The men would be taught to shoot, for which purpose an allowance of practice ammum- tion would be necessary, but no drill would be required. They would not wear uniform, except that a distinctive pugree would he served out. This would have to be given free. A statement embodying the conditions of service m the Dthala levy also a proposition statement, are herewith submitted, and I trust that Government will favourably consider the proposals I have ventured to put forward. 8 Those proposals heing for a levy for the Amiri and Shaibi borders alone no mention is made in the memorandum of a British officer to superin- tend but if the levy is increased by entertaining men to watch the demarcated Hau’shahi and Subaihi borders, or even the Haushabi border alone, it yjuld be necessary to have an officer to take charge of the whole. The length of the Haushabi frontier, following its curves, is nearly, if not quite, 30 miles. The whole length of the Subaihi border to the sea at Thurba must he fully 100 miles. A good deal of the latter would not, I hope, require to he often visited, but I think the lowest number of men required for the Haushahi and Suham 1 frontier together would he about 70, say, 20 for the Haushabi border, and the remainder for the Subaihi. A considerable _ proportion of the whole, perhaps a third or a half, would he camel sowars. N either the Political Officer at Dthaia, nor either of the Assistant Residents at Aden, could look after these men, and, in the event of any additional levies being raised, I would propose to put Mr Bury in charge of the whole, and that he should he an ex officio Assistant Resident, with special supervision over the Haushabi and Suhaihi frontier, n this case the Political Officer at Dthala would be relieved of the charge of the levy employed on his part of the border, so far as their pay, discipline, an instruction were concerned, though they would heat his disposal as regards their employment in his district.

The length of the boundary line between these two places is about 60 miles, allowing for the curves and irregularities of the line. No portion of it is, however, more than 30 miles distant by too road from Dthala. The greater portion, say, four-fifths, of the boundary line is in country only fit for men on foot to work in, that is, on the high moun ams of the Shaibi, or in the narrow valleys and gorges on and near the Fiver Ii an. Bxpert hillmen, such as nearly all the tribesmen round Dthala are, can Jnove about in such a country with far greater freedom and celerity than cou mounted men. The only piece of flat country near the boundary, sul ‘ ;a '^. or the work of mounted men, is that between Lakmat-ash-Shub and the B an, forming about one-fifth of the total distance mentioned. I would, propose that the Arab levy at Dthala should consist of one-fifth mounted menon camels, and four-fifths footmen. Forty men is the smallest number that would be found adequate for the work to be performed. Half of them would aiwavs he out patrolling and the remaining half at Dthala, in reserve, and available lor special services under the orders of the Political Officer. There would thus he 8 mounted men and 32 footmen. It would naturally he desirable that these men should he as representative as possible of the various tribes on and near the boundary line, not only on account of their superior local knowledge, but also because the enlistment of a certain number of men from each tribe would be an inducement to the good will and co-operation of that tribe. I would, therefore, propose that the men be recruited as follows Tribe. Camelmen. Footmen. Total. 1. Shaibi 0 6 6^1 2. Amiri (Adjacent to the 1 5 6 Lon 3. Dakkam f boundary. 2 2 4 20 4.

Mehrabi 0 2 2 8 32 40 Camelmen have been apportioned to districts where there are plenty of camels and consequently where good men could be selected without difficulty. In the case of men from countries along the boundary, I would not propose to employ them exclusively in their own native districts, hut all men should be liable to be employed wherever required in the Aden Hinterland, and this point would have to be made clear to the men on enlistment. Equally I would deprecate any preponderance being allowed, either at first or later on, of any particular tribe, especially of the dependents of the Amir of Dthala (entered under heading Amiri). As regards pay, I would propose the following rates :— Per mensem. Rs. One Jamadar (camelman) at Rs. 60 ... 60 One Havildar (footman) at Rs. 30 ... 30 Seven eamelmen at Rs. 25 each ... 175 Three Naiks (footmen) at Rs. 20 each ... 60 Twenty-eight footmen at Rs. 15 each ... 420 Total ... 745 No rations to he given either for men or camels. Camelmen to bring their own camels. No pension system is proposed, at any rate until the levy has assumed a permanent form. I am of opinion that the men, both camel and foot, should be armed with Martini-Henry carbines, so that they may have a weapon superior to the Lebel- Gras French rifle which is, as a rule, the best weapon in the possession of the surrounding tribes. For the post of Jamadar I would mention the name of Sheikh Husen Saleh of the Azraki who was in the Addareja expedition and has been during the past two years employed with the Aden Boundary Commission. He is an invaluable man and of good social position. For the post of Havildar, I would mention the name of Thabit Hassan of the Hajeli, at present employed as my head Arab guide. I put these two names on record, in case the information should be useful to some'other officer later on, but there are plenty of good men who could be picked with care from among the tribes mentioned for enlistment m a evy such as that proposed. ^ ^ , r r G.

Your letter of the 7th January, No. 59-E.A. Please see Residfciit &amp; proposals forwarded with my 113, dated 8th January. We are unable to support the idea of Arab levies at present and letter containing our proposals as to the preferable policy and fresh treaty with Amir of Dthali leaves to-day or to-morrow. We think that these papers ought to be considered and the policy settled before the Resident at Aden opens negotiations for fresh treaty as desired in paragraph No. 4 of present letter, which instructions we should like to delay. ^ ^ dated Bombay Castle, the 12th January 1904. From—The Honourable Mr. S. W. Edgehly, C.I.E., I.C.S., Secretary to the Governmeut of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 113, dated the 8th January 1904i, and to my telegram of to-day’s date, I am directed to submit the following remarks on the proposals submitted by the Political Resident, Aden, for the enrolment of levies to patrol the Amiri frontier and for the permanent posting of a Political Officer at Dthala. 2. In the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council the propo sals are premature and he does not share the anticipation of the Resident as regards the active renewal of Turkish intrigue and encroachments. It appears to His Excellency that, though there may be some intrigue by local officials through the agency of such mischievous individuals as Mahomed Nasir Mokhbil, vet that the mapping and actual demarcation of the frontier must render any encroachment extremely difficult, and that the probabilities of the case are rather as indicated in paragraph 2 of the Government of India letter No. 576-E.A., dated the 7th March 1902. His Excellency is also of opinion that there is no good evidence at present to justify our proceeding on any other assumption than that the Turks will respect their engagements with the British Government and on complaint will be ready and willing to take measures to enforce respect of those engagements on their subordinates. If these views be accepted the case put forward by the Resident for the enrol ment of the levy appears an inadequate justification for the expenditure and interference with the tribes which the proposal must involve. 3 I am further to submit that the principle of tribal responsibility, coupled with a minimum of British interference, is not only our traditional policy in the Aden Hinterland, but was expressly advocated in this Govern ment letter No. 5151, dated the 14th July 1902, is, as pointed out in that IpHer annarentlv the policy which still finds favour with the Secretary of State’ and is the policy substantially accepted by the Government of India in their’letter Na 1856-K, dated the 9th September 1902. His Excellency the Governor in Council sees no reason to abandon this policy m favour of one of direct interference coupled with the heavy expenditure which the Resident s ' 4 -»SSJSWSTfflC* £32 m Fr ee and safe transit for British Officers or parties in connection with frontier and all other matteis,(2) Maintenance and preservation of the boundary pillars in Amiri borders; (3) Good conduct of the Amir’s own people and prompt information of V ; interference and all matters of importance from the other side of the boundary ; (4) Lease, if required, of a site for a sanatorium for Aden and grant of land necessary for railway purposes. 4. His Excellency the Governor in Council is of opinion that stipulations (1) and (4) above would probably be complied with readily by the Amir through a sense of loyalty and friendship, and he must already have a lively sense'of the value of (1) in his own interests. Compliance with the provisions of (2) and (3) must, however, obviously be a source of not inconsiderable expense to the Amir, and, taking the cost of the Resident’s proposals as indicat ing the cost of an efficient alternative, it is clear that the Resident might be authorised to offer to the Amir such stipend as may be necessary up to dollars 200 or even dollars 300 per mensem so long as the obligations accepted are , 3 « j. i c it,, carried out to our satisfaction. If the telegram dated 25th August 1903, from the . , ... . Political Resident, Aden, to the Government of Amir responds readily and satisfactorily, India. the question of the grant of a salute of 9 guns might be considered. G. L C. P. 0.—No. 3116 P.

Sir, I am desired to acknowledge receipt of your letters and telegram noted Letter No. 113, dated the 8th January 1904. tlie margin, dealing With tllC proposals „ No. 219 , 12 th „ „ of the Political Resident at Aden for the Telegram No. 215, dated the 12th January 1904. • , . . e maintenance and supervision ot the boundary of the territories of the Amir of Dthala, the demarcation of which has now been completed. 2. General Maitland’s proposals, as described in his letter No. 333, dated 18th December 1903, which formed an enclosure to your letter of the 8th January, include— {a) the permanent location of a Political Officer at Dthala; (5) an escort at Dthala of varying strength, composed of details from the Aden garrison; (c) the enlistment, from the 11 tribes on or near the boundary line of the Amiri and Shaibi frontier, of a levy of 40 men at a monthly cost of Rs. 745. His Excellency the Governor in Council is not convinced that the time has yet come for the definite measures proposed by General Maitland. He is not anxious to extend the scope or range of British interference in the Aden interior: and would prefer to test the principle of tribal responsibility before adopting arrangements that must effectively and finally destroy it. He is disposed to agree to the conclusion of a fresh treaty with the Amir of Dthala, providing expressly for— (1) the free and safe transit for British officers or parties; (2) the maintenance of boundary pillars on the Amiri borders; (3) the good conduct of the tribesmen within the border, and prompt information as to interference or disturbance from beyond the boundary; and (4) the lease, if required at a later date, of a site for a sanitarium for Aden and the grant of land necessary for railway purposes. To these should be added certain other provisions that will presently be mentioned. 3. The question of the enlistment of a tribal levy demands independent examination. The suggestion was first made by General Maitland in his letter No. 107, dated the 7th June 1903, when dealing with the question of our liability for acts of aggression committed by tribesmen under our Protectorate on residents in Turkish limits. It was pointed out at that time, with reference! K' )lt\ SP -p 1 { w| i ,U- \\ L J 1 • 4 -n Turkish Ambassador in London, that it was difficult to t0 C T P ltoniSy to across the frontier, so long as the latter remained accept respon y delimitation has been completed on the Amiri wTttere’is no doubt that the measure of our responsibility for the good border, tne w ithin the Protectorate has increased. Moreover, hehaviour of the tnb^ rntmn ii specifically referred to the pointi the'Government of India consider that they are not only entitled, but are iw mwm in view of all the expense and trouble which have been incurred in securin “’the Amir of Dthala against violation of his territories, to insist upo^a greater immunity to the caravan routes passing througn Amin territory between the interior and Aden. , The determination of the means, however, by which these aims are to /t The determination ui tuo , j V nnnlies not only to the border, 60 miles long, of the Amin country, and' to the territory within that border, but to the Haushabi and Subaihi border and to the whole length of the frontier that may eventually be demar- , 3 ’ Conseouently, if the present scheme be accepted even on the moderate scafe proposed^by“be Kesident, the Government of India wi I be m danger of finding themselves committed to a system that is certain to call for considerable expansion, that will involve large expenditure, and lor the ultimate success of which there do not appear at present to be any certain guarantees Before taking any such step, they would desire to have further opinions, and they think that the Commissioners who have resided for so long in the Amin and Shaibi countries might be consulted with advantage. ^ r Similarly the Governor-General in Council is not prepared, from the information at hb&lt; disposal, to pronounce finally at the present stage upon the suggestion to station one of the Political Assistants permanently at D hah. It will probably be found necessary to leave such an officer there for a time, and to place at his disposal a small escort of regular troops; and the Govern, ment of India are prepared to assent to this arrangement for so long as it may he shown to he necessary. As regards the levy, it may he that some such force will ultimately be reauired since the capacity of the tribes to keep the peace may be doubted, while it is possible that trouble may be fomented across the border. But it seems to His Excellency in Council that the Political Officer who may be left at Hthali will be in a better position to advise on this matter, when he has been there for some little time after the Commission has retired. It is from every point XiewL preferable that the Amir should defend bis country with his own men: and no effort should be spared to pursue this attempt, and to provide it with reasonable chances of success. In order to secure the above objects, it seems desirable that the new o. m oraer to secure bnc autovc — , treaty with the Amir should, in addition to the four engagements which have already been named, also stipulate for («) acceptance of respOTSibihty by the Amir for the safety of the caravan routes, (b) the right of the British G ment to station a Political Officer and the necessary escort at DtWi whenetor this is held to be necessary, and (c) the right, in the event o£ the ^ = to keep order within his borders, to introduce a levy system, the subsidy tern proportionately reduced. These conditions might he amalgamate m some more concise and suitable form. In return, the Government of India will be p p to raise the monthly stipend of the Amir to 50 dollars m p Durbar sufts. 7. am to ask that the proposals indicated above may now, with the permission of the Governor in Council, he forwarded to t e ^st en , ^ a request that he will obtain the opinions upon them of the members of tl Boundary Commission, and of any other selected officers, Mi i ary , .i ’ whom he may desire to consult; and that he will submit these opinions, g with his own, at an early date to tlie Government of Bombay. n . of the report being in favour of that part of the suggestion w nc inv location of a Political Officer and small escort at Dthali, I am to re q General Maitland he directed to submit, with his report, an estimate cost of the proposal for one year. I am also to ask that t e ^ am officer whom he would propose to leave at Dthali may be submit jonecess GoTem® tfflitofi® ; I ■ \\ *8. In conclusion, I am to say that the Governor-General in Council sees no necessity for the present to grant a salute to the Amir of Dthala. The Government of India have shown him great favours, have increased the territories under his control, and have immensely raised his status, and His Excellency the Viceroy considers that it is for him now to show that he can maintain his position, and, if he hopes for greater distinctions, to deserve them. I have the honour to be, Sik, Tour most obedient servant, L. W. DANE, Secretary to the Government of India.

No. 29-M., dated Bombay Castle, the 18th April 1904. From The Hon'ble Mr S. VV. Fdgerley, C.I.E , Acting Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, , ^' 0 BANE^Bsq., Secretary to tire Government of India, Foreign Department. I am directed to reply to your letter No. 464.E.A., dated the 10th Eebru- ary 1904, in sc&gt; far as it deals with the conclusion of a fresh protectorate treaty with the Amir of Dfchala. In view of the importance of this matter, I am to attach, for the information of the Government of India, the report of General Maitland, the Political Resident, Aden. 2. I am desired to say that His Excellency the Governor in Council fully agrees in the recommendation contained in paragraph 6 of the Resident’s letter, that the treaty should be as simple as possible and be as far as possible on the same lines as treaties already concluded, and that being so, is prepared to accept the advice in paragraph 9 of the letter, to leave the lease of land for a sanitarium and for a railway thereto to separate negotiations whenever it may be desired to really deal with that project. Similarly, the Governor in Coun cil attaches weight to the argument advanced in paragraph 10, that a specific clause providing for the location of a Political Officer at Dthala is liable to be used undesirably by other tribes in the hinterland. The Governor in Council is also at one with the Resident in thinking that if the Amir of Dthala, who is the reverse of wealthy, is to be held responsible more than in the past for the road from Hardaba to the Alawi border, it will be necessary to give him some special assistance in maintaining order there, and His Excellency agrees that a special portion of the stipend to be fixed should he ear-marked for this particular purpose and is willing to accept the Resident’s estimate that the amount so allocated should be dollars 50 a month. Passing to matters in which His Excellency does not entirely agree with the Resident’s comments, I am to say that the policy of the levy referred to in paragraph of the letter will no doubt he decided on the more, general answer to your letter, now under reply, which is being sent separately to you. His Excellency in Council, how ever, * certainly never supposed that the 40 men who were to compose the levy were to be a defensive force for the 60 miles of frontier which they would patrol or visit. His Excellency presumes that the Government of India also fully realised that the men were to obtain and supply earlier and better infor mation of any encroachments on the demarcated line, whether actual or threat ened, than we should otherwise be likely to receive. Taking the description of the objects of the levy to be what the Resident has described them in para graph 12, it will be seen from the separate letter above alluded to that His Ex cellency in Council agrees with Colonel Wahab in regarding any arrangement of the kind as liable to be considered an interference with the internal arrange ments of the tribe and the responsibility of the Amir. So too he does not agree with the suggestion in paragraph 8 of this letter, that the Resident should make any direct payments to the local Sheiks for the safety of the boundary pillars. Such local payments will no doubt have to be made, but Government must put the Amir of Dthala sufficiently in funds to enable him to make them and must not weaken either his authority or his responsibility by making them direct As the Resident points out in paragraph 12, experience has shown in the past, that all these local Sheiks have not been perfectly loyal, but in the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council the first remedy that must be tried and proved wanting before others are resorted to is the placing or the Amir in a position of complete unquestioned responsibility within his recently ascer tained boundaries and the providing him with means to effectually discharge that responsibility by proving to the local Sheiks that their selt-mterest lies in loyalty to him. 3 The result of these considerations is that His Excellency in Council would recommend that the treaty be negotiated on the lines of the draft of thenew treaty submitted by the Resident, with the exception that he would con sent to the omission of clause 7, thinking that the concluding sentence of clause 5 is sufficient in view of the local understanding to secure the necessary increas ed control of the Radfan tribes. The Resident, it will be observed, would also omit clause 6 which, however, on consideration, His Excellency would prefer to retain. The clause is not liable to be misunderstood by other Chiefs, seeing that they have no frontier to protect, and the maintenance of the frontier is a new obligation of such extreme importance that His Excellency considers that the obligation should be clearly stated in the new treaty. 4. The only other point that His Excellency in Council has to touch is that he would again most strongly urge the Government of India to sanction the o-rant of a much more liberal stipend than that contemplated in your letter un der reply. It is known that the Amir is poor. It is known that the maintenance of the frontier will entail on him payments to the local Sheiks, possibly small individually, but in the aggregate not inconsiderable, and if the Amir of Dthala is to have a fair chance of sufficiently discharging the duties which he takes upon himself by the treaty which is to be negotiated, it is essential to give him sufficient funds to make him feel that it is greatly to his interest to satisfy Government that his obligations have been efficiently discharged. It is also clear on the letters that any other system than that of working through the Heads of the Amiri Tribes in the way abore suggested is likely to be infinitely more expensive than that which His Excellency the Governor in Council de sires should be fully tried; and it appears to His Excellency false economy to withhold the few dollars a month which may make all the difference to the success or failure of the policy. His Excellency in Council fully admits the truth of the remark in your letter pointing out what has been done for the Amir, but the benefits conferred will not supply him with funds to make the necessary payments for the work that has to be dune, and His Excellency per sonally thinks that the stipend (including the payment under clause 5) should in no case be less than dollars 150 per mensem, and that dollars 200 a month would not be in the least too much to give for the objects in view, and I am therefore to suggest that if the negotiations on lines now recommended are sanctioned, the Resident may have full discretion to meet the needs of the Amir in a liberal spirit.- - . **m***mm* it /.-? r* 1 ecoiifi race toil admiti! ) ib i No. 76, dated Aden Residency, the 2nd April 1904.

The four conditions proposed by the Government of Bombay are as (1) free and safe transit for British officers or parties ; (2) maintenance of the boundary pillars on the Amiri borders; (3) the good conduct of the tribesmen within the border and promnt information as to interference or disturbance from beyond the boundary; also J (4) the lease, if required at a later date, of a site for a sanifarium and the grant of land necessary for railway purposes. To these the Government of India add— (а) acceptance of responsibility by the Amir for the safety of the cara- van routes; (б) the right of the British Government to station a political officer and the necessary escort at Dthala whenever this is held to be necessary; and (c) the right, in the event of the Amir failing to keep order within his borders, to introduce a levy system, the subsidy being propor tionately reduced. 4. The various treaties which we have made with the Yaffai and Aulaki tribes during the last nine months have all been practically identical in form. They are treaties of peace and friendship, and protectorate treaties combined. They were drawn up on the basis of existing treaties with other tribes, and the protectorate clauses were taken by direction of the Government of India from the Protectorate Treaty of 1st August 1895 with the Lower Yaffai. Almost all treaties of peace and friendship stipulate that the Chief concluding the treaty shall keep open the trade routes and protect persons using them. The existing agreement with the Amirs of Dthala is no exception, and the present Amir has always fully acknowledged his responsibility in this respect. I ven* ture to submit that the essential thing about the proposed new treaty with the Amir is that it should be a protectorate treaty, and, if so, the protectorate clauses should no doubt follow, as closely as possible, those in the other treaties.5. The treaties contain the ^ 0 ^°wing stipulations :« I. —Peace and friendship and freedom of intercourse; that is to say, the subjects of each shall be free to come and go in the territories of the other, and shall mutually be accorded protection and respect. II. —Then come the protectorate clauses—■ (a) The gracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King-Em- peror is accorded to the territory of the Chief and its depen dencies. (b) The Chief binds himself and his successors and his tribe to refrain from entering into any correspondence or treaty with any other nation or power; and also promises to give immediate notice of any attempt at interference. (c) The Chief binds himself and his successors not to cede, or otherwise dispose of, any part of his territories to any power other than the British Government. III. —The Chief promises on behalf of himself and his successors and his tribe to keep open the roads in his territory, and to protect persons using them for the purposes of trade, whether going to wards Aden or coming therefrom. 6. In my humble opinion treaties with the Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate should be as simple as possible, and the stipulations should be confined to the most necessary points. Arabs are very suspicious, and the Chiefs know the provisions of all the treaties we have made well enough. New forms of treaty, or new clauses, are sure to give rise to misgivings. When we began to make the treaties, which have recently been concluded, w r e had to argue over and explain every clause ; and the negociations took a long time. The later treaties, however, have been accepted almost at once. I therefore respectfully submit that the less the treaty w ith the Amir varies from the treaties with his neigh bours, the Yaffai as Suffal, the better. The draft herewith submitted for approv al has accordingly been framed on the same lines as these treaties. 7. Of the four conditions proposed for embodiment by the Government of Bombay, numbers (1) and (3), and of those added by the Government of India, the first stipulation, («), appears to me to be sufficiently provided for in the present form of treaty. But in order to satisfy (2) and to more completely carry out (3), I have added two clauses, VI and VII. I should, however, prefer to see both these clauses omitted. 8. With regard to (2), the maintenance of the boundary pillars, I would observe that as these are necessarily on the actual boundary line, they belong just as much to the people on the Turkish side as to those on ours ; and they can be destroyed by ill-disposed persons, who are Turkish subjects, without the Amir having a chance of interfering for their preservation. To lay on the Amir, by an article in a formal treaty, the obligation of maintaining the boundary pillars, appears to me rather hard, and I think we should have great difficulty in getting him to accept this condition. My own idea was to pay the local Sheikhs, on whose borders the pillars stand, a small sum for each pillar, as long as it remained standing. It was hoped that each Sheikh would then endeavour to arrange w r ith his neighbour on the other side for the pro tection of the pillars, giving him probably some part of his small allowance for co-operation. It seemed possible that in this way a joint interest in the preservation of the pillars might be created. At any rate, if the pillars were not protected, there would be no pay for the border Sheikhs, I intended to leave the management of this matter in the hands of the Political Officer at Dthala, the small allowances being provided from the allotment for Darbar presents. There would really be little or no extra expense, as the Shei chs would get certain presents from time to time in the ordinary course, and they 2paid three or four times the proper value, pocketing the difference himself. Captain Warnefotd, to whom I showed the papers, was particularly strono* on this point, and begged me to impress on Government the desirability of avoid ing any appealance of anxiety to secure land, either for a sanatarium or for any other purpose. 10. As to condition (5), the right of the British Government to station a political officer and escort at Dtbala, 1 would observe that it has hitherto been assumed that the British Government, as the paramount power, has the right to send its officers and troops wherever it pleases within the territories of allied Chiefs, and to keep them there as long as it may think fit. So far as I am r aware, this right has never been questioned; and though some tribes might dislike the presence of British officers and troops, and might even attack them, if they felt strong enough to do so, I do not think that any of the Chiefs in alliance with the British Government, and drawing stipends, would say that we had no right to send officers and troops into their country, or to keep them there as long as might be necessary or convenient. But the formal insertion of this right in the treaty of any one Chief would appear to imply that it is not i pre-existent, and consequently that we are not entitled to send our officers and troops into the territory of “any Chief unless a special covenant to that effect has been entered into with him and his tribe. I have already observed that the Chiefs know very well the provisions contained in each other’s treaties, and I am sure that the point would at once be noted. The result would probably be that the next time we wished to send an officer, or a detachment, into any part of the interior, except the Amir’s country, we should be met by an objec tion from the Chief that we had no right to do so, as it was not in his treaty ! The situation thus created would obviously be exceedingly inconvenient, and I would earnestly recommend that the proposed stipulation should not be insert ed in the treaty. 11. The Amir of Dthala is aware that there is a probability of a political officer and some troops being retained on the plateau for an indefinite time, if not altogether, and he is not only quite reconciled to the idea, but he would, I think, be much averse to their withdrawal. 12. The last condition is (&lt;?), the right, in the event of the Amjr failing tinnately reduced. I have ventured to submit in my letter of last week* that the levy is not intended to protect, or keep order on, the frontier, being in fact much too small for that purpose. I should perhaps have explained^ this when making the proposal originally ; but it did not strike me at the time that 40 men could be regarded as in any sense a defensive force, ihe proposed levy is intended to give to the Political Officer, and consequently to the Amir, earlier and better information of any encroachments on the demarcated line, whether actual or threatened, than the Amir would be likely to receive from his own i i . t i j_i _ i- ~ „ -w-rri i I v\ /-\4- Kn t n oil oo one « • No. 72, dated 24th March 1904. to keep order on his frontier, to introduce a levy system, the subsidy being proper-their intrigues will have some effect. Whether the levy is constituted or not the business of defending the frontier, and keeping order in its neigh- bourhood as far as his own people are concerned, will necessarily remain with the Amir who would turn out his tribesmen and dependents for this purpose, as might be required. The question, therefore, of introducing a levy system in place of purely tribal responsibility does not arise, and I trust it may never do so But if it should, the levy will have to be numbered by hundreds instead of tens and the entire reduction of the subsidy approved for the Amir, which amounts, at most, to one hundred rupees a month in Indian money, would be but a drop in the ocean compared to the expenditure involved. It is in fact less than one-seventh of the cost of the small levy of 40 men which I have proposed. I would therefore respectfully suggest that this condition should not be inserted in the treaty. 13. Pinally, with regard to the opinion of the Government of India as to the caravan routes expressed in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Department letter. It is there said that a greater immunity must be insisted on in view of the expense and trouble which have been incurred in securing the Amir’s possession of his territories. I am not very clear as to what was in the minds of the Government of India in making this observation. The road through the Amir’s territories has always, I think, 'been safer than the other, and even more impor tant route through the Haushabi country to Mavia and Taiz. From the most southerly Turkish post on the Amiri plateau to Hardaba, 16 miles south of Dthala, the road has been practically secure since the present Amir came into 1 power. ’ From Hardaba to the Alavi border, a distance of some 5 or 6 miles, the Kotaibi were in the habit of giving trouble by levying dues to which they had no right. The Amir for some time closed the road to caravans, making them use the alternative Mishwara route, which is more difficult but perfectly safe. The Kotaihis, like the other “ A1 Ajud ” tribes, are under the suzerainty of the Amir, but they have for long repudiated his authority, and he is not strong enough to coerce them. Kecently the greed and insolence of the Kotaibis brought them into direct collision with ourselves. I was obliged to attack them, and in the course of the operations they received severe punishment. We have still a post at Sulek to protect that part of the road which adjoins the Kotaibi country, but the Amir has been informed that he is to take it over shortly. Since it was assailed by the Kotaibis last October, the post has been re-constructed, and it is now a very defensible place. It has been planned specially with a view to its being handed over to the Amir. The Alawi have also voluntarily built an will hold a strong tower on their boundary at the southern end of the Habilen plateau. The difficulty will be to get the Amir to maintain a sufficient garrison at Sulek. There should he 50 men there, or thereabouts, for the present; but it will cost money to feed them, and a certain amount of arrangement. We have found that, in these cases, although the Chiefs willingly send men tor the protection of a road, whenever they are wanted, the numbers dwindle away, and before long the post disappears altogether. I have, therefore, made an addition to clause V of the draft treaty, binding the Amir to keep 50 men at SuIeKj or elsewhere, as desired by the Resident. 14. I would strongly recommend, however, that if this stipulation he en tered in the treaty, the Amir’s stipend should he raised to 100 dollars per mensem. I proposed in my letter No. 292, dated 26th October 1903, that the Amir should be granted a stipend of 50 dollars a month to enable him up his position, and to place him on an equality, in this respect, with the Yanai Chiefs, his neighbours, to whom stipends had recently been granted under their treaties. The Amir is no doubt obliged by his existing agreement to keep the road open, and I think he has carried out this engagement well, especially when it is remembered how he has been harassed by the Turks and kis re venues diminished. Even now he is a poor man, and if we make it a condition of his treaty that he is to permanently maintain 50 men on the road below Hardaba, I think he should have an additional allowance to help him to do so. The Haushabi Sultan, whose position as guardian of a trade route is very similar to that of the Amir, receives 136 dollars a month, and he is not bound to keep up any particular post or posts. I hope therefore that Government will, if the condition be approved, also sanction the larger stipend. 4In any case I would propose that the stipulation as to keeping up a post of 50 men on the road, and the 100-dollar stipend, should go together. If 'the stipend is not to be raised above the 50 dollars already agreed to, I think the stipulation as to the post should be dropped. In fact, it appears to me improbable that the Amir could be induced to accept one without the other. Draft of new treaty with the Amir of Dthala. The British Government and the Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan, the ruler of Dthala, and all its dependencies having determined to firmly es tablish the relations of peace and friendship so long existing between them. The British Government have named and appointed Major-General Pelham James Maitland, C.B., Political Besident at Aden, to conclude a treaty for this purpose. The said Major-General Pelham James Maitland, C.B., and the Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan aforesaid, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:— I. There shall be peace and friendship between the British Government and all the tribesmen, subjects and dependents of the Amir of Dthala. The sub jects of the British, and the people of Dthala and its dependencies, shall be free to enter the territories of the other; they shall not be molested, but shall be treated with respect at all times and at all places. The said Amir of Dthala and other notable persons shall visit Aden when they please. They shall be treated with respect and be given passes to carry arms. It In compliance with the wish of the aforesaid Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan, the British Government hereby undertake to extend to the territory of Dthala and all its dependencies the gracious favour and protection of His Majesty the King-Emperor. III. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan hereby agrees, and pro mises on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, and the whole of the tribesmen, subjects and dependents, under his jurisdiction,* to refrain from entering into any correspondence, agree- * Literally “ both those who are under his hand m ent or treaty with any foreign nation and those who follow him. ” or p 0Wer ; an ^ furth er promises to give immediate notice to the Besident at Aden, or other British officer, of any at tempt, by any other power, to interfere with the territory of Dthala or any of its dependencies. IV. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan hereby binds himself, than the British Government. V. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan further promises on be- m* i.™ ?. tM tS A protect all P™.. *1» -J ! »direction of Aden for the purposes of trade, or returning therefrom. In further ance of this object the said Amir, on behalf of himself and his successors, engages to maintain at Sulek, or other place or places, named by the Resident at Aden, a post of 50 men, or any less number that the Resident may from time time agree to. VI. The said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan also engages, on he- § / half of himself, his heirs and successors, and all his tribesmen, subjects and dependents, to maintain the boundary which has been demarcated by the joint British and Turkish Commission, and to protect the boundary pillars. VII. Purther, the said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan undertakes, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors, to maintain order within the boundary of the territories of Dthala and its dependencies, and to restrain his tribesmen, subjects and dependents from creating disturbances either in his own territory, or in the country beyond the boundary line, and from interfering with the tribes who are subjects of the Turkish Government. VIII. In consideration of these undertakings and engagements the British Government agree to pay to the said Amir Shaif bin Sef bin Hadi bin Hasan, and to his successor or successors, a monthly sum of one hundred (100) dollars, the half of which is fifty (50) dollars.

The real point to be decided is whether a Political Assistant is to be at once permanently stationed at Dtlmli or not secure the full fruit of the recent demarcation. It is, of course ob- ymus that any British responsibility in the hinterland can be discharged with a much greater sense of security when such discharge depends on a highly intelligent British Agent posted actually on the spot, and if this were the whole ot the case to be considered, His Excellency would have no difficrUtym supporting the proposa! that a Political Assistant should be so placed. That is, however, by no means the whole case for consideration • other factors are the expectations formed in the minds of the Chief by our policy in the past which was stated in paragraph 3 of my letter No. 219, dated the 12th January 1901, and which there is so far no indication that His Maiesty’s Government desire to abandon until it has been proved by experience to be in adequate to meet the increased responsibility consequent on the delimitation of the frontier. What Colonel Wahab says in paragraph 5 of his letter of the tribal levy seems to be no less true of the proposal to formally post a Political Officer at Dthala. After all that is said and done it is clear that the presence of an Assistant, whether assisted by the levy or not, must to some extent weaken the responsibility of the Tribal Chief, and if his dealing direct with the local Sheiks for the safety of the boundary marks were to be the policy approv ed, it cannot be denied that it would constitute a considerable interference with the past authority of the Amir of Dthala and with the internal adminis tration of his territories. Mr. EitzMaurice’s memorandum shows the difficul ties that will probably have to be met in the future; they are practically the difficulties that have had to be faced in the past with this very considerable amelioration that the boundary will be, in his opinion, an obstacle which the Turkish officials will certainly respect and it will, therefore, not be necessary to deal with episodes such as the tower of Addareja, the seizure and occupation of Jalela or the tower of Auja. In Mr. Fitz Maurice’s paragraph 7 will also be found a substantial support of the policy which the Government of Bombay have more than once pressed upon the Government of India in regard to the moral and material support of the Sultan of Lahej in his dealing with the Subaihi and Haushabi tribes. It is the same policy which His Excellency the Governor in Council has now the honour to recommend towards the Amir of Dthala as regards another part of the frontier ; and there is certainly no reason to be found in these papers why that policy should be held to be a failure ; nor is there any reason given to lead His Excellency to suppose that it may not, fn discharge our increased responsibility m the future. _ Should success Will be attained at a less cost in the long run than rs involved 1 . t 8 ^ C Ve“S’s proposals, and certainly With the gain of avoiding any m the Kesiaeru s p i interference with the internal inde* imputation of » P re “^ : e g h )d it fai i it will be open to Government to have pendence “^sGll grtter confidence to the policy now recommended by the recourse w^h still &amp; Governor in Council considers that there is an Resident.

Military and Political, whom the Resident may wish to consult. j-tc-omum, 3. With reference to the latter point,, I would observe that the oul y officers belonging to Aden, ei her Military or Political, who have any know! ledge ot the country and peop e, are, or rather were, my own Assistants; Lieute- nant-Colonel Abud Captain Warneford and Mr. Bury. I naturally consulted them in framing the proposals. Lieutenant-Colonel Abud is now in an independent position, and I have suggested that his views should be obtained by the Government of Bombay. I understand that he has been desired to forward them direct to me,_ but they have not yet been received, and I think it will be better not to detain this letter any longer for them. They will be transmitted as soon as possible after their arrival. * J 4. With regard to the opinions of the Members of the Boundary Com- mission, I forward herewith a letter from Colonel Wahab, addressed to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, with an enclosed Memo randum^ Mr. Fitzmaurice. As regards the permanent location of an Assist ant Political Kesident at Dthala, with an escort, I would venture to point out that, apart from the cost of sending up supplies [to the troops, no extra ex pense is necessarily involved beyond the deputation allowance of the offi cer, and the pay of a few additional Police sowars (Arabs) to act as his orderlies. 5. I he sanctioned establishment of the Aden Residency comprises four Assistant Residents, and one Native Assistant. The latter* has disappeared, but we have at present an Extra Assistant (Mr! Bury) who does a great deal of the work formerly done by the Native Assistant, and is extremely use ful. He should in my opinion be retained. Of the regular Assistants, the first Assistant is Chairman of the Executive Committee of. the Settlement, and of the Port Trust. He also does magisterial, and miscellaneous adminis trative work, and he should he the Resident’s chief adviser in all political matters. Another Assistant Resident is Cantonment Magistrate, Superintend ent of Police and Municipal Officer. He has no political duties whatever. A third Assistant is at Perim, where he is lost to the Residency, as far as political work is concerned. The fourth Assistant Resident should be in Aden to help in the magisterial duties, etc.; but owing apparently to the Bombay Political Department being short of officers, we are almost alw T ays without the services of this officer. If the establishment of Assistants were maintained at the sanctioned strength one of them could he permanently located at Dtbala without inconvenience, especially if the Extra Assistant is2 permanently retained. Even when we are short of an Assistant Resident, it would be much better to have a political officer at Dthala than at Perim, an arrangement being made for carrying on the slight magisterial duties at the latter^place, while no political officer is there. 6. In this connection I would venture to invite attention to paragraphs 5 to 8 of my letter No. 189 of 20th July 1903 ; in which it is suggested that the emoluments of the officers in this Residency should he so far increased as to afford them some inducement to prolong their stay in Aden. Since I have been Resident (a period of two years and nine months), the First Assistant has changed five times, the second and third Assistants each eight or nine times. Ten different officers have filled the two latter posts, sometimes holding one and sometimes the other, according to seniority. In these circumstances it is not to be expected that the Assistant Residents can have a proper knowledge of, or take much interest in, the political work ; especially when, as commonly happens, they have no colloquial knowledge of Arabic. At the present moment Mr. Bury and myself are the only officers of the Residency, who have any ade quate acquaintance with political affairs ; and Mr. Bury is the only one of us who can converse with the chiefs in their own language. 7. It will be understood from the above, that the occasional visits of a Political Officer to Dthala, and other posts of the frontier, would not he of much use, as the average Assistant Resident, who has frequently no political duties under ordinary circumstances, and no time in which to learn them, would not have sufficient knowledge of the country and people to deal effectually with any difficulty of a serious nature. In my humble opinion this reason alone makes it necessary to give the Resident t)ie assistance of a political officer at Dthala who should have a good knowledge of Arabic, and be acquainted with the people with wliom he has to deal. There is no doubt that under the con- ditions wffiich will obtain in the future he will have ample occupation. 8. I attach an estimate of the extra cost of locating a Political Officer at Dthala for one year. It includes provision for six additional police (camel) sow r ars. These w 7 ould not be required if the levy were sanctioned. It is not possible to estimate the expenditure involved by the detachments of regular troops, which would fall on the military estimates. The expenditure of a recurring nature would be mainly for the carriage of supplies from Aden, and would depend on the strength of the troops, and the rate at which camels could he hired. 9. Perhaps I may add here, though it is rather beside the subject, that if the Government of India have decided, or decide in future, to locate a full battalion of British Infantry at Aden (as seems to me highly desirable), it will be a cheaper arrangement to accommodate the 300 men or so who will he over and above the present normal strength, in inexpensive huts at Dthala, than to make the necessary additions to the barrack accommodation in Aden. If this should be done, there would be no necessity to provide any special escort for the Political Officer. 10. With regard to the proposed levy, it would of course he expensive, and Government may not think it worth the money. But I venture respectfully to observe that I am unable to see how it wmuld involve inter ference with the tribes, or infringe the principle of tribal responsibility. I think my letters of 28th April, and 7th June 1903, show that I am fully alive to the importance of the above principle, and I have ahvays believed myself to be a strong advocate for maintaining it. Colonel Wahab’s statement that the establishment of a levy would be regarded by the people as an assumption by Government of the administration of the country, goes so very far beyond the possibilities of the case that it is hardly worth refuting. I would observe that frontier levies have always been largely used on the Punjab frontier, without leading the trans-border tribes to believe that their independence was being interfered with ; and that an Arab levy w r as for a long time attached to the Aden Troop without any body imagining that we were thereby administer ing the adjacent tribal territory. The objqct of th.e proposed levy is not to defend the frontier (a force of 40 men could not by any means defend a frontier,ti 6 , 0 .'“Sw Jol'KSi,”«»-%»w ~ notice of any attempt on the mV “f ^ v Watch ‘ b ?„ b ? rdei ' and gire Mr. ritzmaurice is perhaps right when he^avs thaWh^'r lS l l - S1 i de m e . n ° roaoh - not encroach on the demarcated line but he admi^ ‘ S 1 °n C - la 4 8 - WlU and it appears to me that intrigue will be followefl W nff ^ Wl11 lntri » ue » on the part of their adherents, in some form or othe^ eneroacllm ? nt mg section, discontented with its chief may deel a r« ^ °^ tly ' body, as people on the Haushabi border have done not J t lG Tur r p S m a early and truthful intimation of such occurrences, also to reportperiodicaUv that the boundary pillars are intact, and that the line is being adhered to where it runs through cultivated land, would be the primary buduess of the Tevv n P 1 ,1° ^pl°y^ent of i°cal tribesmen in a levy would enable us to get a better hold of the tribes, and to acquire an influence which will be much more necessary to us m the future than it has been in the past; v, 11 ‘ finally, that there is no resemblance whatever between the boundary now being demarcated and the Afghan boundaries either m the Turkoman desert, or on the Pamirs. In those eases the line runs almost entirely through an inhabited country, and the ruling power for whom we acted is the sovereign of a considerable State. Having once carried out the demarcation, therefore, the Amir of Afghanistan has been left to main tain his frontier. Here, on the other hand, the country on the border is for the most part well populated, and it is the British Government which is the paramount power. There is also no comparison between the petty chiefs alono- the border line and the Amir of Kabul. Prom an administrative point of view the conditions obtaming on the Aden frontier much more nearly resemble those °* tl , le ^orth-Western Frontier of India than those of the'border between Afghanistan and the dominions of Russia in Asia, and the measures to he taken for maintaining the Aden boundary will have, it seems to me, to be similar in character to those which experience has shown to be necessary in the Punjab. J 12. The treaty with the Amir of Dthala will he dealt with in a separate letter. • r No 23, Secret, Dated Sanawi, the 19th March 1904. From—COLONEL R. A. Wahab, C.I.E , Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph 4 of your letter No. 464-E. A., to the Government of Bombay, I have the honour to submit the following remarks. 2. It is admitted that the delimitation of the protectorate will involve the I assumption of a certain increase of responsibility for the good behaviour of the | tribes; at the same time it is desirable, to adhere as long as possible to the* principle of tribal responsibility, and to postpone any measures which would commit Government to more direct interference in internal affairs until the capacity of the tribes to adequately protect the caravan routes has been found wanting. 3. The security of the routes depends so much on the relations of the tribes among themselves, that it is impossible to allot the responsibility for any specific outrage without a more intimate knowledge of intertribal matters than is obtainable under the present system. It seems, therefore, essential that the Resident should have an Assistant in a position to obtain this knowledge, and this can only he gained by an officer in constant touch with the tribes and who should be permanently stationed, or at any rate spend the greater part of the year on tour in the interior. 4. The proposals in General Maitland’s letter No. 333, dated 18th Feb ruary 1903, apply more particularly to Dthala territory, but as noticed in your letter under reply arrangements must also be made for the control of the Haushabi and Subaihi borders through which the most important trade routes4 lie {via Mavia and Mufalis), and it is I think desirable that one officer should he in charge ot* the whole. In the Dthala and Haushabi borders, Dth&amp;la itself would be a convenient head-quarters, the climate is excellent and the escort mMit on this account be partly composed of convalescents from the Aden garrison. The Political Officer would be in easy communication with all the ' northern part of the protectorate including the Yafa tribes and the outlying divisions whose boundary is still undemarcated. The Subaihi country is more conveniently reached from Aden itself, and his visits there would probably have to be confined to the winter months. 5. As regards the proposal to raise a tribal levy to be used under the direct orders of the Political Officer, Dthala, it will perhaps be better to postpone action for the present. The scheme has certain very definite advantages in that it ensures a proper proportion of the total stipends allotted being distri buted among the various subdivisions of the tribes, and that it exacts service from the tribes hi return for the payments made to them. It is, however, certain that the establishment of a levy on these conditions would be regarded by the people as an assumption by Government of the administration of the country ; and though this might be willingly accepted, at any rate by the weaker sections, it would seem inexpedient to take a step which would inevitably lead in that direction, until the principle of tribal responsibility has been adequately tested. 6. I have the honour to enclose a memorandum by Mr. Fitzmaurice dealing more particularly with the subject as connected \yith the Turkish border. Hotes by Mr. Fitzmaurice on the proposal to station a Political Officer in the Aden Protectorate for supervision of the border, etc. 1. As stated in paragraph 2 of the Secretary to 'the Government of Bom bay’s letter No. 219 of January 12th, 1901, to the Secretary to the Govern ment of India, F’oreign Department, it seems to me that encroachments by Turkish officials, after demarcation will be extremely difficult, if not impos sible. Turkish intrigue there certainly will be. Intrigue is inseparable from Turkish officialdom and no reliance can be placed on their good faith. They, are adepts at intriguing and promptly accusing the opposite side of their own methods. As soon as the effects of the work of demarcation have worn off, a recrudescence of the former complaints and counter-complaints is to expected. 2. Turkish officialdom in the vicinity of the boundary from near Sheikh Said to the Bana is at present represented by the following :— (1) The garrison at Sheikh Said and Kaimakam of Mokha; (2) A custom at Mufalis, managed as usual, by a Turk of mixed Arab and Turkish parentage and assisted by some 20 local Arabs, inter ested financially to the extent of their irregular gains from what may be only euphemistically styled the customs administration; (3) An irregular branch of the Mufalis customs at Doka in W. Sha’b, in charge of a few local Arabs 'selected from the Absi, Athwari, . Shugefi and Zedni (Subaihi) tribes.

The conclusion of that Treaty, if its provisions are enforced, will consequently mitigate the present trouble m the matter of exports, but it would seem that ‘ retaliation,’ were such a policy practicable, would be the only really effective check on the present abuses of the Turkish customs along this frontier. present oW* 3 ‘ ^ thG re ^ s bordering on the frontier, the Turks have no regular system of revenue collection. The tithes are farmed out to some Sheikhs °who recoup themselves by the aid of the moral or material support of the Turkish C^ 1D g to t he abuses which take place between the tithe-farmers and the Turkish authorities, the former are often obliged to requisition the assis tance of the military to enforce the payments of tithes in excess of the regular assessment. The result invariably is that prominent Turkish Sheikhs and 7?® ir followers se ek refuge on the British side from their exactions. It will be difficult for the Arab Chief (Amiri, Haushabi, etc.) or the Political Officer to find and hand over such refugees, while the Turkish authorities, who are not accustomed to admit the shortcomings of their system, will most likely attribute the flight of their subjects to intrigue from our side. The absence of an Extradi tion Treaty with Turkey, as also the existence of the capitulations, must necessarily complicate the treatment of the question of certain refugees and delinquents on either side of the border. The occurrence of such incidents along the Subaihi border is less likely, as Turkish influence has only once or twice been directly asserted in the Yusuf- yin, Kubati, Athwari, Humedi and Zureki countries, and it is only in the case of the Hakmi, who are situated between Sheikh Said and Mokha and who are under the control of the Turkish representatives at both places, that complaints, etc., are to be anticipated. 4. Customs and such administrative incidents leading to local friction and often to frivolous complaints by the Turkish Government have in the past, at times, entailed prolonged and expensive telegraphic correspondence. Were an experienced officer, well versed in the language and local conditions, Tur kish and Arab, stationed near the frontier, he would undoubtedly be able to ascertain the truth of any incidents arising along the border, and either arrange the matter on the spot, or put our authorities in possession of the real facts of the case, should reference to both Governments be eventually necessary. Ac counts from Arabs are almost invariably coloured or exaggerated, and the Amir of Dthala, who has had bitter experience in the past with the Turks, but has during the last couple of years learnt what the tribal Arabs style “ the ways of Government *’ is the only local Arab who, in a certain degree, might be trusfed to deal with Turks and report on incidents occurring between his own, and Turkish Arabs. The presence of a Political Officer would, however, I think, he advisable even in his case. 5. A great deal would depend on the character and experience of the Political Officer to whom the task would be entrusted. He should be a man either well acquainted with, or capable of learning, Arabic and the idiosytfcracies of Yemen Arabs. He should also be able, without interfering in purely tribal matters, to acquire a strong personal influence which he could, when necessary, exert towards the settlement of any questions arising between the natives and his British escorts, or between the former and Turkish represen tatives, He should, moreover, be prepared to hold the appointment for a considerable period, as rapid changes would certainly be detrimental to the influence' of the post itself.A Political Officer stationed in the interior nmst hare a few natives in his “syttarsa iz'sfzisZs.

I have already recommended the permanent emnlovi ment of Mr. Bury as Ex ra Assistant Resident, in lieu of the Native Asristant who was formerly an important member of the Residency staff. But the appointment of an Extra Assistant, employed in the way that both Colonel lif , v Ud nr a ^ d “u 86 p Py°P ose to em pl°y Mr. Bury, does not obviate the desirabi- hty, or necessity, for the permanent location of a Political Officer at Dthala. T e duties of the two officers would be entirely apart, and each would find himself ful y occupied. The occasional visits of the Extra Assistant to Dthaia which is what Lieutenant-Colonel Abud seems to contemplate, would not enable the Resident to maintain the close touch with frontier affairs which is in my opinion essentia 1 ; Of course it is possible that, in time things may so settle down that the occasional visits of an officer to Dthala, and other parts of the frontier, would suffice; provided the officer was well acquainted with chiefs and tribes, and had a good command of Arabic. But that does not appear to me tu be hkely for some considerable period. We may be certain that the Turks Iii T i® Ue * 1 an( ^ difficulties will arise, requiring to be promptly and skill- tuily dealt with.^ Even now there are indications of trouble in the Yaffai country, m which ^ Salebbin Omar, the pro-Turkish rival of Sultan Kabtan is strongly asserting himself against the latter. Should he obtain a real ascen* dancy, an incursion into the Amir’s country is not impossible, the probability ot which would be much increased if our troops there were withdrawn; and I feel sure that if the frontier is left without a Political Officer for any length of time, very troublesome complications will arise. I think this is recognized by the Government of India, who have agreed to the location of a Political Officer at Dthala for so long as it may be shewn to be necessary. 3 * Events themselves shew whether the retention of the Political Officer at Dthala is necessary or not. He can be withdrawn if, and when, the country^ in the neighbourhood of the frontier relapses into a state of somethino- resembling permanent quietude. The point I wish to make now is that an officer will have to be stationed on the border for an indefinite time, and that consequently the staff of the Aden Residency should be kept permanently up to its ^ full strength in Assistant Residents, an Extra Assistant being also pro vided in place of the former Native Assistant. 4. With regard to the border levy, which as I have already shewn* is not *ride my letter No. 72, dated the 24th ^ 0r , the , d A e f eD , ce of ‘^ frontier, Lieutenant- March 1904. Colonel Abud understands that this pro posal has been negatived; and he therefore makes no further allusion to it. However, in a demi-official letter to me he says “ in my remarks, I am supposing that your proposal as to local levies has been finally rejected, though I am pretty sure they will be necessary in the end.” I have nothing to add on this point to what has been said in my previ ous letters. 5. With regard to the new treaty with the Amir of Dthala, Lieutenant- Colonel Abud suggests that it should provide for the sums to be levied by the Amir on the various classes of goods passing through his country. That is to2 say, he proposes that a scale of transit dues should be laid down, and embodied in the treaty. The question of transit dues is one which has been giving us some trouble, and considerable attention has already been paid the subject. Certain agreements between the Chiefs, and the Resident, are in existence, in which the former undertake to levy dues on fixed scales ; hut they are now of somewhat ancident date, and require revision. This would have been under- taken by now, if the Boundary Commission, and matters connected therewith, had not occupied so much of our time and attention. The revision, however, will necessitate negociations with the Chiefs, and will take time. I would deprecate dealing with one chief alone, and besides, to do this in the case of the Amir would delay the conclusion of the treaty. I therefore do not recommend that the suggestion should be carried out. 6. Lieutenant-Colonel Ahud, like myself, draws the attention of Govern ment to the similarity in the positions of the Amir of Dthala and the Haushabi Sultan, with respect to the trade routes. He proposes that the allowances of these chiefs should be equalized. The stipend of the Haushabi is 136 dollars per mensem, and my recommendation as regards that of the Amir is that he should he granted 100 dollars a month, with a condition attached regarding the maintenance of men to protect the road. I think we might see whether this will be accepted. Government of India letter No. 464-E.A., dated 10th February 1904. The above letter and the correspondence underlying it has been forwarded to me for remarks under the endorsement of the Chief Secretary to the Govern ment of Bombay, No. 1442, dated 26th February 1904, which requests me to forward the same direct to the Resident at Aden. The Resident’s proposals include— (а) the permanent location of a Political Officer at Dthala; (б) an escort at Dthala of varying strength, composed of details from the Aden garrison; (c) the enlistment, from the 11 tribes on or near the boundary line of the Amiri and Shaibi frontier, of a levy of 40 men at a monthly cost of Rs. 745. C has been postponed at all events for the present. His Excellency the Governor-General in Council is disposed to agree to the conclusion of a fresh treaty with the Amir of Dthala, providing expressly for— (D the free and safe transit for British officers or parties ; (2) the maintenance of boundary pillars on the Amiri borders; (3) the good conduct of the tribesmen within the border; and prompt information as to interference or disturbance from beyond the boundary; (4) the lease, if required at a later date, of a site for Sanatarium for Aden and the grant of land necessary for railway purposes ; (5) acceptance of responsibility by the Amir for the safety of the caravan routes; (6) the right of the British Government to station a Political Officer and the necessary escort at Dthala whenever this is held to he necessarv: and (7) the right, in the event of the Amir failing to keep order within his borders, to introduce a levy system, the subsidy being propor tionately reduced. As regards («) the Government of India in paragraph 5 of their letter contemplate the necessity of leaving a Political Officer at Dthala, at all events for some time after the close of the Commission. This will necessitate the presence there of the escort in proposal (6). For the time being therefore proposals and “ft” have been tioned. The question of the permanent location of a Political Officer at Dthalawould seem to hare arisen from the proposal to employ local levies for the protectaon of the frontier, m which event the services of an officer on the frontier would be an absolute necessity, hut as this proposal has been negatived for the present, 1 think that the permanent location of a Political Officer at Dthala ,s hardly necessary but I am of opinion that the Resident’s staff of Assistants should be increased by an Extra Assistant, specially selected for his knowledge of Arabic and the habits and customs of the tribes, and his ability to deal with them, pur intercourse and relations with the Arab tribes has enormously increased during the last two or three years, with a corresponding increase in the work of t ie Aiabic Department, not only in the correspondence but more especially in the reception and entertainment of guests, in coping with which ^ eS i ab . llS ! lme ^ t 1 ° f officers is insufficient. I would therefore propose that the Resident should he given an Extra Assistant to deal with this depart ment and also any other work he may see tit to delegate to him. He would also be available for duty in any part of the protectorate seeming to require his presence. Apart from the levy question, I do not think that the permanent location of a Political Officer in any part of the protectorate is necessary, but at any time circumstances may arise which will necessitate the despatch of an officer to some part of the frontier, not for the purpose of interfering in inter-tribal politics, but with reference to the protection of the frontier or the trade routes. VYhilst in Aden this officer’s time would be very fully employed in the Arabic Department or other department at the discretion of the Resi dent. At the present time the Resident has no officer available for work outside the Settlement, who could be employed in the Hinterland, without disturbing the administration of the Settlement. Captain Warneford’s sad death has deprived the Resident of the officer who was most fitted for this special employment, and in the absence of any officer in the local Political service who is now qualified for the post. I would put forward the name of Mr. Bury, at present a temporary Extra Assistant for confirmation as such, on a progressive salary and the ordinary pension and leave rules of the uncove nanted service. Mr. Bury would seem to be peculiarily suited to such employ ment, as by residence among the Arabs for many years, he has acquired a knowledge of their character and politics, which would take an officer of the regular service, who had not had such opportunities many years to acquire. As regards the proposed protectorate treaty I would respectfully draw atten tion to Aitchison’s Treaties, No. 68, page 175 of Volume XI. This already provides for the safety of the roads and engages the Amir to be answerable for any outrage or misdoings of the Radfan and Halmin tribes and of all the tribes subject to him. In addition to these and other terms proposed, I would venture to suggest that the new treaty should provide for the sums to be levied by the Amir on goods passing through his territory. An agreement with the Resident of this nature was made in 1888, but, as far as I recollect,^ it was never formally ratified by the Government of India. The question is one of considerable importance and is a very fruitful source of friction, and I think that the scale of charges fixed by the agreement of 1888 might he included in the new treaty and thus receive the formal sanction of Government. I would respectfully urge the reconsideration by Government of the amount of the stipend proposed, and I would venture to suggest that it should be raised to at least the sum received by the Haushabi. I consider the Amir s position and status to be quite, if not more, important than that of the Haushabi, and that consequently the stipend received by each should be approximately the same. Unless Government are prepared to concede this to the Amir, I apprehend that considerable difficulty will be experienced in inducing him to accept the terms of the proposed treaty, as be will no doubt urge that the stipend does not ade quately represent the increased responsibilities imposed on him.

Secret, No. 15. Aden 'Protectorate : proposed introduction of tribal levies, and other measures. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, I have under had my consideration the correspondence which has passed between your Government and that of Bombay, relative to the introduction of tribal levies and other measures in the Aden Protectorate, ending with your Secretary’s letter No. 464 E.A., dated the 10th of February 1904. 2. The main object which was desired in delimiting the external frontier of the Aden Protectorate was the ascertainment of the line of frontier, so that the Turkish authorities might not encroach or advance beyond it without a clear understanding that they were violating the British sphere of influence. In other respects the fundamental prin ciple upon which British relations had been maintained with the tribes around Aden, described by the Government of Bombay as “ the prin- “ ciple of tribal responsibility coupled with a minimum of British “ interference,” had been vindicated by its success, and the absence of serious quarrels with the tribes and any entangling complications. The object hitherto kept in view has been the reduction of the military force, and the political establishments at Aden to the smallest limit required for the defence of that coast fortress and its usefulness as a coaling station, and a link in the chain of Imperial communication and defence. I recognise the obligation which delimitation may involve, of performing certain friendly offices for the Turkish officers, and m particular for restraining the tribes within the British protectorate from committing offences beyond the border. In this view it may be neces sary to impose upon the Amir of Lthali and other tribal chiefs, by fresh agreements, international responsibilities which they have hitherto evaded But I should view with misgiving any tendency to extend the range of our interference with the tribes themselves, cr to weaken the defence of Aden itself by exciting opposition m the interior and takhm part in tribal disputes which-do not affect external rela ions. The increase of the military force at Aden is a contingency which, in view of Imperial obligations elsewhere, it is desira e o avoic. S. 17. V&gt; * desire, therefore, that no action should be taken in the direction of establishing agents in the interior, the introduction of the levy system, or the lease of land for sanitorium or railways, without prior report to me, and the full sanction of His Majesty's Government; and it seems to me that the introduction into the treaty of any express stipulation on these points is unnecessary, and may give rise to misapprehension. In the event of the Amir’s failure to fulfil his engagements, it would always he open to us ourselves to take such steps as we might think necessary to attain the objects which those engagements were intended to secure. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Brodmck.No. 7894, dated Mahableshwar, the 23i-d November 1903 (Confidential)'.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Mr. RusselPs letter No. 2114 E.-A., dated the 7th September 1903, I am directed to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 292, dated the 26th October 1903, from the Political Resident, Aden, in further explana tion of proposals for the increase of the stipend of the Amir of Dthala and the grant of a salute to that Chief. 2. I am to say that His Excellency the Governor of Bombay while agree ing with General Maitland as to the ultimate necessity for increasing the Amir’s stipend, ^ probably so as to make it equal to that now drawn by the Subaihi Sultan, is still of the opinion that the time has not arrived for putting * such proposals into effect. 3. I am, however, to suggest that, until the time is ripe for negotiation of a treaty, the Resident may advantageously be authorised to show to the Amir special favour in the form of “ Darbar presents” up to a maximum value of 50 dollars per mensem less his ordinary stipend.

Edgerley, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Govern ment Bombay, Political Department. With reference to the correspondence forwarded with your No. 6240, dated 18th September 1903, I regret that in proposing by telegraph an increase to the stipend of the Amir of Dthala I should have taken action which has been regarded as precipitate and inappropriate. I would, however, venture very respectfully to submit that considerably greater importance attaches to this matter than has so far been recognised, and I am the more sorry that I did not, in the first instance, take the ordinary course of putting forward my proposals by letter, with a full explanation. 2. Stipends are not granted to Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate for their personal enrichment, hut in order to enable them to maintain their position, and to secure the good behaviour of their subordinate Sheikhs by the presents and entertainment which play so large a part in social and political life m Southern Arabia. Almost every Sheikh expects to get something from his superior and to he well entertained, according to the Arab fashion, whenever he visits his Chief. In like manner every Akil, or elder, of a section, or sub- tribe expects entertainment, together with his followers, from his immediate superior ^ If presents are not made by superiors to subordinates, or if enter tainment is withheld, or not given on a fitting scale, there is much discontent, and the Sultan, or Sheikh, who fails to carry out the obligations which custom imnoses loses not only popularity, hut also influence. Very serious troubles and°dissensions may ensue if subordinate Chiefs are not treated by their suzerains in what they consider a fitting manner. 3 is already explained (my No. 224, dated 2nd August 1903), many Chiefs are heads of confederacies rather than tribes. These confederacies are held together by custom, mutual advantage, and respect for the family of the mramount Chief, which has sometimes been in power for many generations. But of ^u»e they are not so closely united as a tribe of one blood, and m such cas^ the personal influence and prestige of the Chief is a very powerful factor in maintaining order and coliesiom The Ainiu^is or i mme diate few in number, and they are practically { i, i vcrim r»nv him any revenue whatever.

This step is, in my opinion, a most important means of maintaining peace in the Amiri country, and closing the door to iurkish tetXi^ I should also be glad to see the Amir honoured with a salute of seven U guns to mark our appreciation of his behaviour, and the good sense and self-restraint he has exhibited during the past two years The grant rf a salu wild also be politic as raising him in the eyes o thc neigdiboi iang Yemen Arabs, and as vindicating his position vis a vis with the luiks, wh sistently endeavoured to belittle it in every way possible. 7. I venture, with the utmost respect, to strongly deprecate P 0st P 0 ^ n ; of the consideration of the increase to the Amirs stipend u^il the general examination of our needs and responsibilities, after the demarcatio • This would delay the matter for a year, perhaps two and in the meantime J difficulties might, and probably will, arise which the present bestowal ot a reasonable subsidy on the Amir would obviate. # The proposed grant of a salute maybe deferred for discussion till alter the conclusion of the demarcation, if Government so please, but no , &gt; the stipend. . . 8. I would point out that the Amiri frontier may be regarded as settle already, except in detail, and I submit that no awkward prece en created by my proposal. I append a table showing the stipends n °Y /? all the Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate. The Amir is at the very bottom ot the list. The Chiefs, who, together with the Amir of Dthaia, stand in t nearest relation to us, are the Haushabi, the Abdali, and the la in stipends are already very much higher than that which I have propose . Amir, the lowest being nearly three times as great. ^ Even the lit e Sultan gets 40 dollars a month and the Subaihi sections 25 to 4U doi ars,to four times as much as the Amir’s present stipend. The Alawi Sheikh, who is quite a small Chief, far inferior to the Amir iu rank and nosition, also toik® receives three times as much. The Amir’s subsidy is so much below the ordinary level that, so far as the fear of creating a precedent is concerned, it may very safely he raised to the sum which I have proposed, viz., 50 dollars per mensem. 9. If the grant of an increased stipend he approved, the Amir should, in return, accept a protectorate treaty. I think it is very desirable that a treaty of this nature should be concluded with him as soon as possible. His present agreement with the British Government relates only to the protection of the roads, and he is not at the present moment in any way hound to maintain the frontier we are obtaining for him at so great a cost. 10. Finally, with regard to the observation in paragraph 3 of Mr. Bussell’s letter No. 2114 E.-A., dated 7th September 1903, I would explain that though the Amir can have no legitimate grievance on account of the fact that Kataba and other outlying districts will not he included in his territories, yet the Boundary Commission formally proposed to claim these places in his behalf, and this seems to have become known to him. When I arrived here in August, he was fully persuaded that they would sooner or later he handed over. I have endeavoured to disabuse him of this idea, but I have no doubt that when Kataha and Yubi and Haiki are definitely left to the Turks, he will feel disappointment, which may not he the less acute because it is unreasonable. Government does not, perhaps, always realise how different is our position with regard to the Chiefs in this country from what obtains in India, and how dependent we are, and always must he, on their good-will and co-operation in carrying out any policy whatever, even although it may he altogether for their benefit. An increase to the Amir’s stipend is, as I have endeavoured ^ to show, very desirable on the ground of general policy, and perhaps of justice, and if this be admitted, it can hardly he inadvisable to bestow the gift at a time it will produce the greatest effect. i 0 ]i Tiy Table showing stipends now paid to Chiefs in the Aden Protectorate (26th October 1903).

Hill, Esq., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—The Honourable Mr. S. W. Edgerly, C.I.E., Chief Secretary to tho Govern ment of Bombay. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7894, dated the 23rd November 1903, regarding the proposed increase of the stipend of the Amir of Dthala and the grant of a salute to the Chief. 2. On consideration of the arguments employed by General Maitland in his letter No. 292, dated 26th October 1903, forming the accompaniment to your letter under reply which show the importance he attaches to an immediate display of liberality to the Chief, the Government of India agree to the sugges tion made in paragraph 3 of your above-quoted letter, and I am accordingly to convey sanction to the Political Resident at Aden being authorised to show to the Amir special favour in the form of c&lt; Darbar presents ” up to a maxi mum value of 50 dollars a month less his ordinary stipend. This arrangement will have effect from the date of the receipt of this letter. 3. The question of granting the Amir a salute and a permanent increase of his stipend will be decided in connection with the conclusion of a Protec torate treaty, and in view of the fact that the Amiri border is now in a fair way to settlement, the Government of India are inclined to acquiesce m General Maitland’s opipion that a treaty should be arranged with the Amir of Dthala without waiting for any general revision of the treaties with the other Chiefs in the Protectorate. *■ 4. I am therefore to authorize you to instruct the Political Resident at Aden to begin the necessary negotiations at his discretion, and to submit ms proposals in due course. No. 60-E. A.

I am directed to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, the accompanying copy of a conddential letter No. 333, dated the 18th December 1903, from the Political Resident, Aden, and of its enclosures, submitting proposals for the permanent posting, in future, of a Political Umcer at Dthala, and for the enrolment of levies to patrol the frontier of the Aden Hinterland as it is demarcated. 2. I am to state that any remarks the Bombay Government may desire to make in this connection will be submitted hereafter. No. 333, dated Aden, the 18th December 1903 (Confidential). From— Major-Gbneral P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. The delimitation of the boundary of the territories under the Amir of Dthala is now approaching completion, and I venture to think that the time has arrived when it is necessary to consider the arrangements that should be made for the maintenance of the line which has been demarcated with so much labour and at so large an expenditure of money. 2. As the first and most essential point, I would submit that one of the Assistant Political Residents at Aden should he, in future, permanently stationed at Dthala, or in its neighbourhood, to watch, and, if necessary, to control, under the direction of the Resident, affairs in that neighbourhood. I am decidedly of opinion that without a British officer on the spot there would soon he an active renewal of Turkish intrigue and encroachment, and that very undesirable complications, not only with the Turks, but with the local tribes, would almost certainly ensue. 3. Our general policy would, of course, he to support the Amir, while maintaining good relations with the Yaffai and other tribes beyond his sphere of influence, and with the Turkish officials at Rata ha. I have elsewhere explained the position of the Amir as the head of a confederacy, rather than the chief of a tribe, and some of its difficulties. If Government are pleased to * Eesident’s letter No. 292 , dated the 26tii October grant Amir Shaif the increased stipend isos. which I have suggested,* I think he will do well, under the advice of a Political Officer. But without a respectable stipend, and the support of a British officer on the spot, I am afraid the Amir will not he able to prevent his country again becoming disorganised under the influences which the Turks will certainly bring to bear. 4. The Political Officer will require an escort, the strength of which may, perhaps, be varied from time to time, according to circumstances, and which may be partly composed of convalescent British soldiers and men recommended by the medical authorities in Aden for a change of air. 6. I have all along been of opinion that something in the form of a local levy would be required to patrol the demarcated line, to inform the Political Officer of any attempts at encroachment, and to see that the boundary pillars are not thrown down. Such a levy would also increase our hold over the tribes, and be useful to the Political Officer in a variety of ways. After several dis cussions on the subject with Captain Warneford, at present Political Officer at Dthala, and also with Mr. Bury, I directed the former to draw up a memo randum on the formation of a levy for the Amiri and Shaibi frontier alone, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, If, and when, the Haushabi and Subaihi borders are demarcated, the levy would have to be increased in proportion to the extent of the demarcated line, and the probabilities of encroachment from the Turkish side., „ T^rotjosals in the memorandum, which are on 6.

The portion of the frontier to he superintended from Dthala as a centre would extend from the River Bana on the north-east to Jebal Warwa on Baushabi border on the south-west. The length of the boundary ^ ies these two places is about 60 miles, allowing for the curves and irre 'll ^ of the line. No portion of it is, however, more than 3 0 “ lle ® dar l ii ne road from Dthala. The greater portion, say, four-fifths, of the boundaj^ is in country only fit for men on foot to work m, that is, on the g ,r dian . of the Shaibi, or in the narrow valleys and gorges on a ? d “® ar . th ® ' ^ ftn move Bxpert hillmen, such as nearly all the tribesmen round Dthala are, c about in such a country with far greater freedom and eelen 7 {ot mounted men. The only piece of flat country near the boundary, the work of mounted men, is that between Lakmat-ash-Snub an i, e f 0 re, forming about one-fifth of the total distance mentioned. 1 Y, ’ „te d men propose that the Arab levy at Dthala should consist of one-fiith mounon camels, and four-fifths footmen. Forty men is the smallest number that would be found adequate for the work to be performed. Half of them would always be out patrolling and the remaining half at Dthala, in reserve, and available for special services under the orders of the Political Officer. There would thus be 8 mounted men and 32 footmen. It would naturally be desirable that these men should be as representative as possible of the various tribes on and near the boundary line, not only on account of their superior local knowledge, but also because the enlistment of a certain number of men from each tribe would be an inducement to the good will and co-operation of that tribe. I would, therefore, propose that the men be recruited as follows:— Tribe. 1. Shaibi 'j 2. Amiri f Adjacent to the 3. Dakkam C boundary. 4. Ahmedi J 5. Shairi 6. Ajud 7. Azraki 8. Jihaf 9. Hamada 10.

In the case of men from countries along the boundary, I would not propose to employ them exclusively in their own native districts, but all men should be liable to be employed wherever required in the Aden Hinterland, and this point would have to be made clear to the men on enlistment. Equally I would deprecate any preponderance being allowed, either at first or later on, of any particular tribe, especially of the dependents of the Amir of Hthala (entered under heading Amiri). As regards pay, I would propose the following rates : Per mensem. One Jamadar (camelman) at Rs. 60 One Havildar (footman) at Rs. 30 Seven eamelmen at Rs. 25 each Three Naiks (footmen) at Rs. 20 each Twenty-eight footmen at Rs. 15 each Total Rs. 60 30 175 60 420 745 No rations to be given either for men or camels. Camelmen to bring their own camels. No pension system is proposed, at any rate until the levy has assumed a permanent form. , ... I am of opinion that the men, both camel and foot, should be armed with Martini-Henrv carbines, so that they may have a weapon superior to the Lebel- Gras French rifle which is, as a rule, the best weapon in the possession of the surrounding tribes. £ oi. -i n tt For the post of Jamadar I would mention the name of Sheikh Husen Saleh of the Azraki who was in the Addareja expedition and has been during the past two years employed with the Aden Boundary Commission. He is an invaluable man and of good social position. For the post of Havildar, I would mlnti^ thTrome of Ihabit Hassan of the Hajeli, at present employed as my head Arab guide. . „ , I nut these two names on record, in case the information should be useful to S ome P other officer later on, but there are plenty of good men who could be pickS with care from among the tribes mentioned for enlistment in a levy such as that proposed.

Please see Resident’s proposals forwarded with my 113, dated 8th January. We are unable to support the idea of Arab levies at present and letter containing our proposals as to the preferable policy and fresh treaty with Amir of Dthali leaves to-day or to-morrow. We think that these papers ought to be considered and the policy settled before the Resident at Aden opens negotiations for fresh treaty as desired in paragraph No. 4 of present letter, which instructions we should like to delay. No. 219, dated Bombay Castle, the 12th January 1904. From—The Honourable Mr. S. W. Edgerly, C.I.E., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 113, dated the 8th January 1904, and to my telegram of to-day’s date, I am directed to submit the following remarks on the proposals submitted by the Political Resident, Aden, for the enrolment of levies to patrol the Amiri frontier and for the permanent posting of a Political Officer at Dthala. 2. In the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council the propo sals are premature and he does not share the anticipation of the Resident as regards the active renewal of Turkish intrigue and encroachments. It appears to His Excellency that, though there may be some intrigue by local officials through the agency of such mischievous individuals as Mahomed Nasir Mokhbil, yet that the mapping and actual demarcation of the frontier must render any encroachment extremely difficult, and that the probabilities of the case are rather as indicated in paragraph 2 of the Government of India letter No. 576-E.A., dated the 7th March 1902. His Excellency is also of opinion that there is no good evidence at present to justify our proceeding on any other assumption than that the Turks will respect their engagements with the British Government and on complaint will be ready and willing to take measures to enforce respect of those engagements on their subordinates. If these views be accepted the case put forward by the Resident for the enrol ment of the levy appears an inadequate justification for the expenditure and interference with the tribes which the proposal must involve. 3. I am further to submit that the principle of tribal responsibility, coupled with a minimum of British interference, is not only our tiaditional policy in the Aden Hinterland, but was expressly advocated in this Govern ment letter No. 5151, dated the 14th July 1802, is, as pointed out in that letter, apparently the policy which still finds favour with the Secretary of State, and is the policy substantially accepted by the Government of India m their letter No. 1856-E., dated the 9th September 1902. His Excellency the Governor in Council sees no reason to abandon this policy in favour of one of direct interference coupled with the heavy expenditure which the Resident s proposal renders inevitable until the possibilities of tu a co-opera ion an responsibility have been exhaustively tested and proved inadequate. Resort to the Resident’s present proposals is at all times possible, but it they are now adopted there will be no way back. His Excellency the Governor m Council is therefore of opinion, that with the demarcation of the Amin border, the time has arrived when our arrangements with the Amin Sultan may vith advantage be revised, as indeed the Government of India have independently deci e in their No. 59-E.A., dated the 7th January 1904 and I am to request sanction to the Political Resident being authorised to conclude a fre^ treaty witli he Amir of Dthala and which shall include by clear engagements the foliowiu 0 mXers o^er and above the usual terms of the Aden Protectorate Treaties Free and safe transit for British Officers or parties in connection with frontier and all other matters; 1 U f-i i i £ m2 (2) Maintenance and preservation of the boundary pillars in Amiri borders; (S') G ood conduct of the Amir’s own people and prompt information of V J interference and all matters of importance from the other side of the boundary ; (4) Lease, if required, of a site for a sanatorium for Aden and grant of land necessary for railway purposes. 4 His Excellency the Governor in Council is of opinion that stipulations m and (4) above would probably be complied with readily by the Amir through a sense of loyalty and friendship, and he must already have a lively sense of the value of (1) in his own interests. Compliance with the provisions of (2) and (S’) must, however, obviously be a source of not inconsiderable expense to the Amir, and, taking the cost of the Resident a proposals as imhcat- ine the cost of an efficient alternative, it is clear that the Resident might be authorised to offer to the Amir such stipend as may be necessary up to dollars 200 or even dollars 300 per mensem so long as the obligations accepted are .a™, * carried out to our satisfaction. It the Pol Amir responds readily and satisfactorily, India. the question of the grant of a salute of 9 guns might be considered. G. L C. P. 0.—No. 3116 P. D.—19-1-04.—f 4.—G, B.(Confidential.)

General Maitland’s proposals, as described in his letter No. 338, dated 18th December 1903, which formed an enclosure to your letter of the 8th January, include— («) the permanent location of a Political Officer at Dthala; (5) an escort at Dthala of varying strength, composed of details from the Aden garrison; (c) the enlistment, from the 11 tribes on or near the boundary line of the Amiri and Shaibi frontier, of a levy of 40 men at a monthly cost of Rs. 745. His Excellency the Governor in Council is not convinced that the time has yet come for the definite measures proposed by General Maitland. He is not anxious to extend the scope or range of British interference in the Aden interior: and would prefer to test the principle of tribal responsibility before adopting arrangements that must effectively and finally destroy it. He is disposed to agree to the conclusion of a fresh treaty with the Amir of Dthala, providing expressly for— (1) the free and safe transit for British officers or parties; (2) the maintenance of boundary pillars on the Amiri borders; (31 the good conduct of the tribesmen within the border, and information as to interference or disturbance from beyond the boundary; and (4) the lease, if required at a later date, of a site for a sanitarium for Aden and the grant of land necessary for railway purposes. To these should be added certain other provisions that will presently be mentioned. 3 The Question of the enlistment of a tribal levy demands independent examination Nhe suggestion was first made by General Maitland in his letter No 107 dated the 7th June 1903, when dealing with the question of our liability for acts of aggression committed by tribesmen under our Protectorate on residents in Turkish limite. It was pointed out at that time, with reference2 to porrmlaints from the Turkish Ambassador in London, that it was difficult to acceut responsibility for raids across the frontier, so long as the latter remained 11 ndemarcated * but, now that delimitation has been completed on the Amiri herder there is no doubt that the measure of our responsibility for the good behaviour of the tribes within the Protectorate has increased. Moreover, though the Governor in Council has not specifically referred to the point, the Government of India consider that they are not only entitled, hut are called upon in view of all the expense and trouble which have been incurred in securing ’the Amir of Dtbala against violation of his territories, to insist upon a greater immunity to the caravan routes passing through Amiri territory between the interior and Aden. 4 The determination of the means, however, by which these aims are to be effected applies, not only to the border, 60 miles long, of the Amiri country, and to the territory within that border, but to the Haushabi and Subaihi border and to the whole length of the frontier that may eventually be demar cated ’ Consequently, if the present scheme be accepted, even on the moderate scale proposed by the Resident, the Government of India will be in danger of finding themselves committed to a system that is certain to call for considerable expansion, that will involve large expenditure, and for the ultimate success of which there do not appear at present to be any certain guarantees. Before taking any such step, they would desire to have further opinions, and they think 0 that the Commissioners who have resided for so long in the Amiri and Shaibi countries might be consulted with advantage. 5. Similarly, the Governor-General in Council is not prepared, from the information at his disposal, to pronounce finally at the present stage upon the suggestion to station one of the Political Assistants permanently at Dthali. It will probably be found necessary to leave such an officer there for a time, and to place at his disposal a small escort of regular troops; and the Govern ment of India are prepared to assent to this arrangement for so long as it may be shown to be necessary. As regards the levy, it may be that some such force will ultimately be required, since the capacity of the tribes to keep the peace may be doubted, while it is possible that trouble may be fomented across the border. But it seems to His Excellency in Council that the Political Officer who may be left at JDthali will be in a better position to advise on this matter, when he has been there for some little time after the Commission has retired. It is from every point of view far preferable that the Amir should defend his country with his own men : and no effort should be spared to pursue this attempt, and to provide it with reasonable chances of success. 6. In order to secure the above objects, it seems desirable that the new treaty with the Amir should, in addition to the four engagements^ which have already been named, adsmstipulate Tor (a) acceptance of responsibility by the Amir for the safety of the caravan routes, (d) the right of the British Govern ment to station a Political Officer and the necessary escort at Hthali whenever this is held to be necessary, and (c) the right, in the event of the Amir failing to keep order within his borders, to introduce a levy syste m, the subsidy being proportionately reduced. These conditions miglit™he^amalgamated in some more concise and suitable form. In return, the Government of India will be prepared to raise the monthly stipend of the Amir to 50 dollars in place of the Durbar gifts. 7. I am to ask that the proposals indicated above may now, with the permission of the Governor in Council, be forwarded to the Resident, with a request that he will obtain the opinions upon them of the members of the Boundary Commission, and of any other selected officers, Military and Political, whom he may desire to consult; and that he will submit these opinions, together with his own, at an early date to the Government of Bombay.^ In the event of the report being in favour of that part of the suggestion which involves the location of a Political Officer and small escort at Dthali, I am to request that General Maitland be directed to submit, with his report, an estimate of the cost of the proposal'for one year. I am also to ask that the name of the officer whom he would propose to leave at Dthali may be submitted. 8. h jone^ govern® 611 t territories t „ frceJW, »3 ''Sii# 1 Atniw siliri 51||| l': b; m®, ail $ 51 1 ie Ail al I imm 8. In conclusion, I am to say that the Governor-General in Council sees no necessity for the present to grant a salute to the Amir of Dthak The government of India have shown him great favours have increased the temtones under his control, and have immensely raised his status, and His ' Excejlency the Viceroy considers that it is for him now to show that he can maintain his position, and, if he hopes for greater distinctions, to deserve them I have the honour to he.

Slr ’ TM f boundary Commission Camp, Sanawi, March 15, 1904. IN forwarding copies o the jon.tly-signed maps of the entire Amiri border and part of the Haushab. border, witn a detailed description of the same, I feel that, no apology is lequned for sending them so late, the difficulty of making, in the field and without proper appliances, the six copies for the six Departments of Government with which we communicate, and additional ones for our Turkish colleagues, is considerable. Making arrangements for survey of such a nature as to insure the safety of our surveyors, keeping up relations with the border Arabs with view to ascertaining the truth as to the boundary, and carrying on negotiations with the Turks, account for most of our time.^ Remaining for any length of time in one place in order to bring our mapping up to date is incompatible with our endeavour to finish the south-western delimitation to the sea in what remains of a cool season, and to shorten the stay of our escort and the troops supporting the Commission in the low-lying portions of the Subaihi Tihama. 2. So many sections of the Amiri boundary have already formed a subject of official coiiespondence that there seems no necessity for now entering into detailed comments on that portion of the frontier. The eastern section of the Amiri border begins at Haid Khatm, but, strictly speaking, at^ Ras Nakil Adana. The villages of Habil Jalb and Kuren are tribally Shaibi by origin, but have practically thrown in their lot with the Amir. As will be noticed, the section in the vicinity of Kataba has been marked out by a large number of masonry pillars, in accordance with the instructions in paragraph 8 of the Government of India’s Confidential letter of the 17th June, 1903. The Dakkam portion of the border is also marked by pillars up to the slopes of J. Hesha, where it follows prominent natural features. From J. Rima to the Ilaushabi border the line follows the watershed along high points most difficult of access, and crosses the Wadis Haura and Tusan at well-marked points. 3. The line actually demarcated in the immediate vicinity of Kataba differs somewhat from that suggested in paragraph 72 of our Amiri Report of the 25th May, 1903, and from the description given in the Memorandum presented to the Porte in September last. In accordance with the second paragraph of the Memorandum on Ukla presented to the Porte, the lower part of W. Reshan was left to the Turks, the line being taken to J. Jarrad and Habil Zireh, thus securing to the Amir the Well of Zireh, which contains the best drinking-water in or near Kataba. 4. Our Diary entries of the 4th, 6th, and 10th October referred to some patches of cultivation in the upper reaches of Selat Hafasa in dispute between the people of Dakkam and Hasha, and as our boundary is a tribal one, which Government wishes should be as free as possible from sources of dispute, we thought best to endeavour to include within Dakkam limits some 8 square miles of territory beyond the green line on Map C, attached to our Report of the 25th May, 1903. The Turkish Commissioners, having received an trade to delimit “to a point 1 kilom. west of the Tiban and due south of Hefa,” at first felt bound, without a fresk reference to Constantinople, to decline leaving the 8 square miles in question to the Dakkam, the point on the map 1 kilom. west of the Tiban being situated within this area. When, however, we showed a disposition not to insist on drawing the line close up to the kouses of Kataba, and explained to them that boundary point No. XLIV, south of \y Tusan. was less than 1J kilom. distant from the Tiban, they ultimately agreed to the inclusion of the 8 square miles within the Dakkam border, thus taking the frontier-line up bv the head of the S. Hafasa and on to the lofty peak of J. Rima. ' This constitutes a rectification, without departing from the tribal basis, of the western Dakkam border on the lines indicated in paiagraph 4 of the Government of India s letter of the 17th June, 1903. We, on our part, agreed to leave them the patch of cultivation—entirely the property of the people of Kataba—lying between Kataba, J. Jarrad, and Habil Badr. , , , . 5 The description of the Amiri border presented to and accepted by the Porte, with the alteration commented on in our diary of the 18th February. 1904, makes the line [1861 hh — l ] Bfrom A1 Aslum to the junction of the Selat Humar with the Selat Kataba, and then follow the latter to the north of Lakmat-ad-Duki . . Taking the line down the S. -Kataba, which is a broad depression almost entirely unde, cultivation and contains the site of the village of Abara close to the well of that name would have been most unsatisfactory;, while a line from A1 Aslnm to the junction of ' Ilnmar with the S. Kataba would run close to the walls of the Kataba barracks. The Amir of Dthala set great value on the inclusion within his limits of the site and cultivation nf Ab-jra We consequentlv gave to the Turks the cultivation in the W. Shaddad, which entirely belongs to the people of Kataba, and, by leaving them free the road out of Kataba passin- close to the junction of the S. Humar with the S Kataba induced them o leave us the entire bed of the W. Abara down to Ukmat-ad-Duk. and to take the line well free of the northern bank from Habil Khadr to Hab, Duwar, thus leaving on the Amiri side a good deal of cultivation belonging to the Tub. village of Shakhab. The Turks further agreed to include within our limits the cultivation near Kuii a Assoufla, which was outside the line first drawn on Map C, and was claimed by both the Haiki and Dakkann remar p that, though the line unavoidably crosses cultivation in parts, in no instance has Amiri cultivation been left on the Turkish side, while the converse has happened to no small extent. „ . . , , , As demarcation does nst imply disturbance of private rights, a document was exchanged with the Turkish Commissioners, and copies given to the local representatives on both sides, certifying that the inhabitants on either side ot the boundary would continue, as heretofore, to enjoy all private rights in matters of real property, water, grazing, and “ wakf.” This went a long way to remove the suspicions ot the natives that the work of the Commission implied an interference with individual rights. _ 7. The villages of Habil-as-Selami, Bir Kes, Jos-al-Jamal, and the site of Abara, as also Lakmat-ad-Duki, now within the Amiri border, are Yubi; but this did not quite reconcile the Amir to the work of the Commission not having resulted in vindicating his claims to the remainder of the Yubi and Haiki villages. On the whole, however, he is very pleased with his present boundary, and is deeply grateful to Government toi t e restoration of his rights. . , , We took steps to introduce him to the local Turkish Representatives, wit i w om e Amir expressed a strong desire to maintain cordial relations, and thus, if possi) e, avoi any serious friction along his border. , . , , 8. The settlement of the northern portion of the Amiri boundary effected with the Turks, together wuth the excellent personal as well as official terms which we wen ou o our way to maintain with them at the time, materially contributed to dispe tieir suspicions that we were actuated by motives of territorial aggrandisement at tieir expense. By keeping them in this frame of mind we were enabled to demarcate e Haushabi border without undue delay, and, under the pretext of border survey, m nee our Turkish colleagues to permit our surveyors to visit points in their territory well ^7°” the area under delimitation. The results are very valuable, as w'e have thus been a e o survey close on 500 square miles of Turhish territory beyond the border zone. &lt; _ The Turks declared they would be able to justify to their own authorities ns departure from the ordinary Turkish system of exclusion by representing that the lesu s of the survey would be of great use to their Government whenever a regular survev o Yeman should be carried out, a contingency, however, which they themselves^ looke r on as very remote.. We undertook to give them the results of our survey in then teintory, and have done so as far as the compilation of the maps in the field permits. We tius there will be no difficulty in subsequently forwarding them, through the British ice Consul at Hodeida, any such work as may not have been completed before we sepaiate. I have, &amp;c.

No. 2. Colonel Wahab to Government of India.—(Communicated by India Office, March 31, 1901.) sir Aden Boundary Commission Camp, Sanawi, March 15, 1901. ’ THE boundary map, sent with letter of the instant shows that portion of the Haushabi bordeJfrom J. Mimtar to Ras Namis. I have the -our further to me ose a blue nrint* on the 4-inch scale showing the remainder of the Haushabi border as demarcated wiA the lurks. The finished map will follow as soon as it can be completed. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Poreign Office for reprodoction, March 80, 1904. c8 2. The Haushabi border may be divided by natural features and tribally into tw ' sections* (\) from J. Mimtar, where the Amiri boundary ends, to Basesa, on the Amatna mn-e thence across the Ad-Dareja Valley to Ras Namis, just under Jalisa, on the spur of I-ibal Jarban * and (2) from Ras Namis across the comparatively open ground to a point, on the south-east slopes of J. Nabi Shaib, called J. Muharraka, where, according to the Haushabi contention, their border ends and the Subaihi border he^ins^ 3 From J. Mimtar to Ras Namis the inhabitants on the British side are pure Haushabi while from Ras Namis to J. Muharraka they belong to the Haushabi sub-tribe of ’ Amri ? who, though originally tribally distinct from the Haushabi, have for a long time back been merged in the latter, and acknowledged the jurisdiction of their Sultan, paving him the tithes and other dues. r /i\ tt * ' On the Turkish side of the Haushabi border are the tribe ot (1) Humar, from J Mimtar to the Wadi Warazan and included administratively in the canton of Kama’ira; (21 the tribe of Badu, from the Wadi Warazan to Dar Wetid and S. Lassab; (3) the tribe of Yusufiyin from S. Lassab to Nijd Baru, or the col between J. Kurra and J. Nabi Shaib; and (4) the tribe of Kubati, whose territory extends from Nijd Baru to j Muharraka and thence along the Subaihi border to Al Ja’ama in the Wadi Sihr. 4. The actual interference of the Turks, or the tribes under their influence, along the ’Amri portion ot the Haushabi border have been, relatively speaking, insignificant, and it is in the valley north of Ad-Dareja that Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, during recent years and subsequent to his appointment by Hussein Hilmi Pasha (ex-Wali of Yaman and now Chief Inspector of Reforms in European Turkey) as Mudir of the nahia, or canton, of Kama’ira, began the series of encroachments that led up to the incident of July 1901, and, in fact, to the present work of demarcation. 5. Muhammad Nasir Mukbil had pushed the Turkish border well down into the Wadi Fakir and to the village of Ad-Dareja, while, as appears from the Commission diary of the 21st December, the territory claimed by him extended to the junction of the Wadi Ziyak and the Wadi Warazan. Certain Turkish claims at Kudash, the building of the tower at Nijd Musamma, the fact that Turkish access to the Yusufiyin and Kubati country lay through the W adi Hawemi and Wadi Hidaba in Amri territory, a route which has been actually used by Turkish troops in the past, the evidently inspired claim to the Juhaili country and the Madraja Pass from Haushabi into subaihi tenitoiy (vide Commission diary entries of the 2nd February and the 3rd February), combined with certain verbal statements of the natives, pointed to the existence of the intention ot Muhammad Nasir Mukbil to gradually absorb the’Amri portion ot Haushabi territory, comprised within a line drawn from the junction of the Wadis Ziyak and Warazan to Minjara and from Muharraka along the now 7 recognized Haushabi boundary to Ras l Namis. . The Ad-Dareja incident thwarted this plan ; but if the lurks had been successful in absorbing the ’Amri country they would, no doubt, have claimed it on the ground that the ’Amvi were distinct from the Haushabi. Undoubtedly the present Haushabi Sultans regime, commented on in the Commissioner’s diary of the 17th, 22nd, and 28th January, and the 17th February, 1904, was not of a nature to win the sympathy of his subjects and counteract Turkish designs, while their Agent, Muhammad Nasir Mukbii, took fu i advantage of such state of things. 6. His policy was to use intrigue, threats, and force to compel the people to accep “ the sway of the Khalifa Abdul Hamid,” and he secerns to have met with a certain success, as is clear from the translations of documents attached to this Report. ie latter shows that some time back the authority of the Haushabi Sultans extended up to the crest of the Amama and Jarban range, immediately south of the village oi^ Mavia. This fact is also borne out by the investigations on the spot between 1877 and 1880 or ie Italian explorer, Manzoni, who, from information compiled from Turkish sources, showe the Turkish boundary as passing just south of Mavia. (Vide Map of Yaman, publishe hi 1885 by the “Institute Cartografico Italiano,” Rome; as also Map B, accompanying Commission’s letter of the 25th May, 1903.) , 7. On the arrival of the Commission at Ad-Dareja, on the 25th December las , ® villagers on the south of the Amama-Jarban range began to evidence a desire to included in the British Protectorate, basing their claim on their old tributary relations o the Haushabi Sultans. They seemed, however, to be actuated more by the wish a escape from Turkish rule than to come under that of the present Haushabi bulta • They number in all about 1,000 souls, and fall under the grouping of th ® ' Va) ' villagers, inhabiting the southern slopes of J. Amama as far as Shabwa, and the Shame , Hanba (tribally knowm as Shijri) and Daba villagers on the south-eastern s rn J. Jarban. Though formerly closely allied to the Haushabi, they are tribally distinc i7 '^iln-JdfpHnn ^Th^Tn 1° or isinally related to the Humar, under Turkish 1 ' 1 ,,, , c usl011 within the British sphere would have given a more natural boundary than that demarcated by the Commission, and it was with a view to such a contingency that m paragraph 68 of the Amiri Report, of the 25th May, 1903, it was suggested keeping open the Amir’s claims to Humar, as “it is to be foreseen that any minor xeci ca ions of that (Haushabi) border which may be found necessary at the moment of actual delimitation there, would be rendered impossible if the Amiri rights to Humar are now definitely ceded to Turkey.” I Ins suggestion did not at the time recommend itself to the consideration of Govern- tnem, out should the Turkish Government create obstacles to the final rectification of the boundaiy as delimited by the Commission, or renew their obstructive methods by raising inadmissible claims along the Subaihi border, specially in the neighbourhood of Ras luiba. His Majesty s Government may deem it expedient, in the final settlement of the frontier, to demand a rectification of this portion of the Haushabi border and make the line run along the natural feature of the xhmama—Jarban range. 8. Our negotiations with the Turkish Commissioners respecting the border between Basesa and Kas ^iamis and the settlement made with them on the spot, were governed by two considerations, viz., the express wish of Government that “ delimitation to the sea should be completed this cold weather,” thus rendering any but minor references to Constantinople impossible; and secondly, that the basis of the present demarcation, as proposed by the Turkish and agreed to by our Government, was the status of the autumn of 1901. Though this principle was departed from in the cases of Jalela, the recognition of Yafa-as-Soufal as British, and the Irade of the 13th February, 1903, authorizing the demarcation of a border from Lakamat-ash-Shub to the desert, it was reaffirmed by the Resident in his letter of the 30th May, 1903. In the absence of any specific instructions from Government on the subject, we consequently felt bound to adhere to the principle as far as possible, and avoid any claims involving serious deviation from it. 9. The case of Shabwa waste a certain extent an exception. This shrine, with i:s lands containing the only abundant supply of water south of J. Amama, has for several years hack been looked upon as Turkish. The claims of the Haushabi Sultan, commu nicated to the Commission in the Residency’s letter of the 23rd September, 1902, including Shabwa, while stating that Daba and Hanba were Turkish. The revival by the local authorities of the old claims to Ad-Dareja was most embarras sing to the Turkish Commissioners, who could not, however, officially surrender them without reference to Constantinople, while it seemed that the Sublime Porte would also be con siderably embarrassed by claims that had led to fighting between British and Turkish, troops. We consequently claimed Shabwa, and thus compelled the Turks to include it in their reference, with the result, as anticipated, that the Turkish Government hurriedly instructed their Commissioners not to press the claims to Ad-Dareja, &amp;c. It then became a question of delimiting the boundary between the lands of Shabwa and tne Wajihi, i.e., from Ras Aseka to Maharib, and north of Aresma to Tawal and Wakadiya, including on the British side the perennial streams in W. Mileli and the Karkahan nullah. 10. The Haushabi Sultan having stated that Daba was Turkish, it became our duty to demarcate on the basis of its just limits. Like Shabvva it is a shiine with wakf lands situated in the Wadi Ziyak. The Turkish claim, as set foith in oui diary entry of the 21st December, 1903, extended down to the Wadi Warazan, but, on making inquiries, we found that a great portion of these lands really belonged to the Syeds of Dthubiyat, in Amiri territorv. We sent for the latter, and demarcated on the basis of their limits, &lt;is detailed in their documents, drawing the boundary-line of Asaf Am Shan, where the Wadi Jihal (belonging to Daba) becomes the Wadi Ziyak, thus again leaving in British territory the perennial stream in the bed of the Wadi below Jihal. It seemed necessary to go into these details to explain the reason of the sharp re-entry of the frontier-line between Wakadiya and Ras Namis, while the Haushabi Sultan has shown a certain dissatisfaction with the settlement of the section of his boundary between Basesa and Ras Namis In spite of his stu ements to tne Residency, recorded in its letter of the 23rd September 1902, to the Commission, he evidently expected to get the crest of the Amama-Jarban lange as his boundaiy and seemed to think that Government had done less foi him than foi the m Dtha ii As a matter of fact, the demarcation of this portion of his border, though it does not give a natural boundary (vide paragraph 5) is more satisfactory than could haye been exnfeted The Intelligence Officer attached to the Field Force in July 1901, together with the Political Officer, went into the question of the boundary above Kafut8 , . , n „ •„ Ttifi results of this investigation are given on his sketch map of the vieinitj AH S upon whiS the frontier is shown as crossing.the crest of a hill about 1,000 of ^ ' 1 “V ’f the tower built by Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, and some 2 miles south ' f sUwt the latter being marked “ Turkish.” The letter in question further states^:— am0 the Haushabi themselves differ as to whether a boundary-line run, nlona the high crest line of this hill, or, lower down, about 800 yards further north along the line of she Karkahan nullah. Arguing from previous grounds it would seem that the line does run along the high crest, and if this is the case, the advantage lies wholly with the Humar and Turks, who from tins high vnntaee ground wholly command the approaches from Ad-Dareja and the line of the W. Ziyak; having good s oping PTonnd in their own rear to hide their own dispositions. If, on the other hand, the boundary be pushed down to the other side of the hill, without interfering in any way with the fields at the foot (which appear without d.apute o belong o the Humar), the advantage would rest entirely with the Haushabi (or British) force, who would command the whole valley and approaches from Mavia, having in their own immediate front an almost perfect glacis-like slope As a matter of fact the Humar at present own The boundary-line now drawn by Masjid Arabi more than redresses the tactical dis advantage commented on in this Report of the Intelligence Officer. 12 The Haushabi boundary from Has Nanus to Ni]d Musamma is quite satis- factory,’ no ground that the ’Amri claim having been left on the Turkish side The four villages ot Tarian, Kudash, Harda, and Wubid were on the hs of “Turkish” villages which the Turkish Commissioners were supposed to claim, but as mentioned in our diary entry of the 15th January, all four were included in Haushabi territory. From t h e junction of the W. Soudan with the Warazan no serious difficulties were encountered up to Nijd Musamma, where the tower of Nasir Harbi {vide Com- mission diary of the 22nd, 2Sth, and 29th January, 1901) necessitated a reference to Constantinople.

This honourable and exalted document in the hands of Sultan Mohsin-bin-Ali Al Eujari, to the effect that we affirm before God that our fathers and ancestors were Haushabi, and paid to the Haushabi Sultan’s fathers and ancestors; that his hands were only forcibly withdrawn by the Turks through Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, who plundered us of our property. We now elect God and Sultan Mohsin-bin- Ali to rule us according to ancient custom. Every Sheikh shall pay the tithe of his country to the said Sultan according to usage, provided he be just and support us against those who seek to give us trouble. This is a witness in his hands.

N. 0 Conor lo the Marquess of l.ansdowne. — (Received August 17.) (No. 646.) Mv Lord, ^ ^ Therapia, August 11, 1904. I INCLOSE herewith to your Lordship a Memorandum from Mr. Lamb, reporting- a telegram received by the Sublime Porte from the Turkish Commission for the delimi tation of the Aden frontier. I have instructed Mr. Lamb to reply that the places mentioned by the Commis sioners are on the British side of the line running from Lakmat-es-Shub to the desert, and cannot, therefore, be a subject for contestation. At the same time I have prepared a Memorandum, of which a copy is likewise inclosed, which Mr. Lamb is to read to the Under-Secretary of State and leave him a copy if desired, but to explain to his Excellency that my proposals are subject to your Lordship’s final assent and approval, and are made solely with a view to bringing these prolonged negotiations to a speedy and amicable conclusion. I venture again to remark that, to my knowledge, the Ottoman Government have never drawn a distinction between the Upper and Lower Yaffai or Aulaki, nor questioned the oft-repeated assertion that these tribes belonged to the nine cantons, which are considered to be under British protection. I am therefore unwilling myself to seem to throw doubt on this point by making a distinction between the upper and lower divisions, and I consider our interests are amply safeguarded by the request that the Porte shall recognize that the canton of the Yaffai and Aulaki, with their depen dencies and sub-divisions, as also all tribes to the east of the line going from Lakmat- es-Shub to the desert, are British. This line includes nearly the whole of the Rubeatein and the whole of the Dhabiani country, and leaves us free to act as we please with regard to Beda, which also is on the British side of the north-east frontier-line. It would be, I consider, very imprudent to raise a discussion in connection with the Imperial Irade of February 190N which I have always regarded as a very favourable solution of a complicated question. I cannot say whether the Porte will accept my proposals. I think they will give the lien over the Subaihi district which we desire, but they may insist upon retaining Turbat Abul Azrar on account of the holy shrine, and upon the line running from Kuwah to Jebel Hosisi instead of to Sheikh Mirad ; but if our reserves are accepted to the country south-east of Akama Ivuddam, I venture to think it is rekffively of little importance whether the frontier ends at Jebel Hosisi or Sheikh Mirad. I shall, of Course, make the best terms I can, but I should be grateful to your Lordship if you will let me know by telegraph whether you approve of the proposals contained in my communication to the Sublime Porte. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. E. O’CONOR. Inclosure 1 in No. 1.
