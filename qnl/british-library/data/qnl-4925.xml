Secretary of State for India, London Government of India, New Delhi. To Repeated No. 1746 Dated the 2dd December, 1945. Your telegram No. 26623 December 1st. For the following reasons I strongly recommend (a) the desirability of early action to keep out undesirable mushroom concerns such as the proposed 'India and Persian Gulf Bank', which has been the subject of recent correspondence with the Government of India. (b) the Imperial Bank of Iran*s familiarity with trade on both sides of the Gulf. (There is an appre ciable volume of trade between Dubai and the Persian ports). (c) their success at Kuwait and Bahrain. (d) the advantage of having branches of the same concern along the Arab side. (e) the fact that due to their experience in Persia the staff of this bank are equipped with more than usual political acumen for dealings in an area like the Trucial Coast. 2. Imperial Bank of Iran wiiLl have to be warned of the Sultan of Muscat's ^nd Shaikh of Dubai's obligation under the Oil Concessions to consult Petroleum Concessions Limited before granting a banking concession. Bank could perhaps themselves approach P.C.L. after their representative has visited Dubai and Muscat. 3.

On the 5th of Tannery X took Mr* Johnson to T&gt;ibai and 'introduced hir? to Bhaikh Bald* The Shaikh readily agreed that a bank was desirable in Oubai and after a brief discussion the Agroenont was handed to him* His son and heir* Shaikh Hashid, present and conducted the negotiations on behalf of his father* The Articles of the Agreement ware rend over to him and explained in detail. They were favourably received with the exception of Article Ho*11 which stipulated that no other bank would be permitted to open a branch at Dubai during the oeriod of the Agreement i.e* 25 years* He cormontod on the fact that rr hile/- f71 he Honourable sir Geoffrey Prior, ff.C.X.B*, Political Pesidont in the Persian Gulf* Bushire. I&gt; ted the gbh January 19^6* . A 4''hile this clause bound him for 25 years the bank was at liberty to withdraw at any time and also that there were tvro banks in Bahrain. The obvious explanations followed and the Shaikh said that he would consider the matter and £ive his decision the following day. 4. He also raised the question of his position vis-a-vis the P.C.L* and the Oil Agreement. I have not seen a copy of this Agreement but I understand that the P.C.L. have to be consulted before a bank can be ouened in Dubai. ! T r. Johnson informed me that you had discussed this point with him and had given him to understand that you had taken necessary action in the matter. I therefore informed the Shaikh that in considering the question of granting a Concession to the Imperial B-nk of Iran, he need not worry about any complications arising out of his Agreement with the P.C.L. I did so on the assurance of Mr. Johnson that this matter had been taken up by you with the P.C.L. 5. On the following morning Shaikh Rashid came to the Agency to continue the negotiations having, as I had anticipated, consulted certain Dubai merchants about the Agreement. He informed us that all the Articles were acceptable with the exception of Article Ho.ll mentioned above. He agreed with the arguments that there vras no scope for more than one bank in Dubai and would not be for many years to come, but at the same time he considered that the Article was too binding. MT. Johnson was adamant on this point and I explained to tho Shaikh that if he wanted the bank to open he would have to accept this clause in the Agreement. Eventually he a^eed to its inclusion if Mr. Johnson would reduce the period of the Agreement. He considered 25 years too long and asked for a reduction to 15 years. It was explained to him'that in order to safeguard the position of the bank, a long tern Agreement was essential etc. etc. and that 15 years was too short a period. I supported Mr. Johnson’s arguments and advised him not to give way on tlr s point unless absolutely forced to. He therefore continued to press for 25 years. At this stage it becam /-. &gt;- 3 it ‘became obvious that Shaikh Hashid considered a reduction in the period to be a point of honour, I therefore advise him to consult his father and informed him that we would visit him in the evening to receive his final reply, we did so and the same objection was raised which was followed by the same arguments. Eventually Shaikh Rashid asked for a reduction as a favour and when 20 years was suggested he readily agreed. Honour was satisfied and the Agreement was readily signed in an atmosphere that was most cordial. 6. Mr. Johnson spent the rest of his time contacting the merchants of Dubai and then left for Bahrain by air on the 9th of January. We discussed his proposed visit to Muscat but in the absence of an air service and the lack of suitable transport to take him overland he was faced 'with waiting for the next steamer which is not due to leave Basrah until about the 10th of January. He was unable to wait this long time and decided to postpone his visit to Muscat until a later date. 7. I enclose a signed copy of the Agreement. Other signed copies have been distributed as follows:- Political Agent, Bahrain 1 Political Office!?, Crucial Coast 1 Shaikh of Dubai 1 Mr. Johnson 3 8.

M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, Lease of ground in Dubai: After considerable discussion the Bheikh of Dubai has offerred to lease us a piece of land in Daira, measuring app roximately 102 feet by 170 feet, and at present occupied by barasti huts on the following terms:- (a) Lease to be for 25years at a ground rent of Rs:300/- per month, 5 years rental payable in advance. (b) The Bank to build a house on the land at its own ex pense, the house to become the property of the Sheikh at the end of 25 years. In reply to our letter advising them of these propo sals, our London Office write us as follows:- 'The Board have also had before them your proposals in your Inspection Letter of 15 June for renting a site at the equivalent of some £. 270 - per annual and build ing thereon a residence which after 25 years would be come the property of the Sheikh. It was the Board's view that under such conditions we should net have to pay ground rent. SIR GEOFFREY PRIOR who happened to call this morning, made the same remark spontaneously and at once characterised that part of the proposals as ridiculous when I shewed him the proposals and the site. He was definitely of the opinion that no charge could reasonably be made for the site. The terms made with the A.I.O.C. and with Gray Mackenzie, whose inter ests and requirements are beyond any comparison with ours, cannot be cited as a guide. The dimensions of the residential site are adequate, and provided you get it free of rent the other terms are acceptable in principle'. We should be grateful if you would advise us whether you could assist us in obtaining a lease of the ground free of rent. Form 120We think it is preferable that the Bank should construct the building at its own expense rather than ask the Sheikh to build a house to our specifications and lease it to us, as we feel sure that the latter plan would involve us in considerable difficulties and delays, and in the long run would be more ex- pensive.

I attach a letter from-Keast, who is building the Bank at Dubai. The land under consideration is Tor ^he building of the Bank Managers house*. Keast spoke to me personally, and wh^t he wishes to knov/ is would we be prepared to bring moral pressure to bear on the Shaikh of Dubai to induce him either to sell, the land to Keast, or if he will not sell, to considerably reduce the rent of ground (Rs.300/- per month) i 'h? London Office of the Bank of Iran hav^e informed: Keast thev consider the terms made with Dubai for this land to be unreasonably in favour of Dubai; they think the ground should be given free of rent. I very much doubt if the Shaikh of Dubai would agree to that, but he. might be induced to sell.
