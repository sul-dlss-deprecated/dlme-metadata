It explains that the purpose of his trip was to speak with Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, and Sooltan been Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr] to ensure that the articles of the Sharga treaty are abided by; Sooltan been Suggur is hesitating with demolishing his towers at Brymee, and the Resident wishes to ensure that this is not used by the Imam's allies to escalate the situation. It is explained that the Resident considers it important to maintain Arab confidence in British mediation, and it is further explained that while the Resident hopes that the treaty will be abided by, he fears that a general war in the region is very likely.The letter also notes that Reeza Ali has been removed from his post as Agent to Sharga, as a result of his absence from that place at a critical period; Reeza Ali has been on an unauthorized trip to Muscat for over two months.The item contains three enclosures:1 - Translation of a letter from Sooltan been Suggur to Ephraim Stannus dated March 1825.The enclosure is explaining why the demolition of the towers at Brymee and Deriah has been delayed; the delay is attributed to the treachery of his own agent Mohomed been Sallem, the attacks Salmine been Nasser has made around Deriah, and the aggression of Shaikh Tannoon [Ṭaḥnūn bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān] against the Benny Kept tribe. It further pledges Sooltan's complete commitment towards meeting his treaty obligations.2 - Translation of a letter from the Imam of Muscat to Ephraim Stannus dated 13 April 1825.The enclosure informs the Resident that Shaikh Tannoon has agreed to abide by the terms of the treaty, and to refrain from attacking neighbouring Arabs; it is feared that any pretext will be seized by Sooltan been Suggur as an excuse not to abide by his recent treaty obligations.The enclosure further reports that Debaye [Dubai] is in a state of confusion, as a result of not having fit leadership. It is noted therefore that Shaikh Tannoon has been instructed to provide the town with protection.3 - Translation of a letter from Sooltan been Suggur at Sharga to Ephraim Stannus dated 20 April 1825.The enclosure is explaining that Sooltan been Suggur has not been able to attend the Resident aboard his ship due to ill health. It provides further details as to why he has been delayed in destroying the towers at Brymee; it claims that his agent Mohomed been Sallem, who had been placed in charge of the said towers has defected to the Imam's side, and according to his enemies wishes has refused to demolish the towers. It is explained this plot is designed so that the Imam can retain his fortifications while discrediting him at the same time.The enclosure further requests that the Resident supplies a witness to oversee the demolition of the towers at Brymee, and invites the Imam's forces to assist with this goal. It is further requested that assistance is provided to overcome any resistance from Mohomed been Sallem, and it is claimed that it is Sooltan been Suggur's earnest wish that the towers are demolished.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000076#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
