The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (numerous incumbents), the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) and the State Medical Officer in Bahrain. The correspondence and other papers cover matters such as: arrangements for the reassignment of wards for RAF personnel; charges to be made for food, medicine and medical services, including increases to these charges in response to the rising cost of living during the war; expansion of hospital facilities, including installation of air conditioning and the construction of a mortuary, paid for by the Air Ministry, with arrangements for eventual reimbursement by the Bahrain Government. A breakdown of the complete cost per month for the provision of inpatients’ services, dated 19 December 1944 is included in the file (folio 33).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000ac#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000ac#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
