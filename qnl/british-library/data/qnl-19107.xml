Kemball writes that he has received correspondence from Major Atkins Hamerton, Her Majesty’s Consul and the Honourable Company’s Agent in the dominions of His Highness the Imam of Muscat, who has investigated the claims. Of the first case, which dates back to 1852, Kemball writes that the evidence suggests the Joasmee [Āl Qāsimī] chief should be given the benefit of the doubt, and accordingly relieved of liability. Of the second case, Kemball writes that it appears Sultan bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī’s subjects were involved, and that he has pointed out to the Shaikh of ‘gross violation’ of the maritime truce that has occurred. Kemball's letter has two enclosures:1. Letter no.3 of 1854 (folios 248-49) from Hamerton to Kemball, dated 10 February 1854;2. Letter no.4 of 1854 (folios 250-51) from Hamerton to Kembal, dated 11 February 1854.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00003b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
