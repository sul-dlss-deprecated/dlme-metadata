The map indicates boundaries, hydrology, and settlements, along with some indication of relief.The map was published by the Survey of Egypt for the Arab Bureau, under the authority of the War Office in September 1916; however, the map also includes additions made by the British Legation at Jedda in February 1934. These additions, which are accompanied by a key, show 'fixed' and 'unfixed' national and provincial boundaries of Saudi Arabia. A cautionary typewritten note attached to the map states that the boundaries shown are 'approximate only'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100045063760.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
