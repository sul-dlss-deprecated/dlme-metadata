(b; The implications of enrolment as far^as the British Government is concerned can be explained oy a member of your ’A’ btaff. as far as the Company’s contractual .obligations vis-a-vis its employees, this is entirely outside our concern or control. (c; ie do not believe this is the case, bee oui’ recommend ations in para 3 below. (dj ;/e do not agree, becrecy must diminish as the number of people who know about it increases, but there^is no reason why the whole scheme should be jeopardised by the enrolment of employees. (e ) The discipline necessary to run an oil field and re finery should be adequate. The training of oil company employees in demolition wonk has proved a practical propbsition elsewhere, for example in BukMa. 2. It is not clear what further information you require about terms of service. .Non-effective benefits refer to hospital treat ment, disability pensions, death benefits and gratuities to which any soldier or his dependents may become entitled. The only modifi cations affecting enlisted and enrolled Oil Company men are:- taj Awards are limited up to the ranks of bubaltern and V/.O. Class II. Od; Periods of training when not embodied are also covered. 3, It is extremely desirable that the demolition party for BAHREIN should be formed from the B.A.P.C.C. officials and employees, but this will mean enrolling most of them. As aresult of a recent visit by E-in-C's G.II (Oil), it is believed that this can be done, if the following procedure is adopted:- (a) benior members of the British and American btaff should be first approached by a tactful (and fairly senior; officer, and asked for their support, and given a full^ explanation of all they want to know; he should explain that the other Gil Companies* men are joining special units for the execution of denial schemes, if they are required. He should explain the special clauses attached to the enrolment and attestation forms, and that the btate of Emergency referred to is the period during which demolitions are prepared and executed. In particular, the senior British officials should be asked to 1 sound* the British employees to see if they will enrol on a voluntary basis.(t&gt;; Previous approaches have been made to the junior employees and have been, on the ..hole, unsuccessful. The Americans should be enrolled with the provistoni that they will be released £rom British oeryice when the job is done, dee Appx. ‘A* to this letter. The Americans are nearly all the leading men o_ tne Company and if the proposition is put to them proper ty, it is believed they will come in. If the approach to the Americans and British has been successful, the Canadians should be approached* im is thought that if the Americans and British had agreed to enrol en masse, they would agree too, but otherwise it is unlikely. They should have the same proviso^arout release as the Americans (.dee ^ppx 1 A* to this letter; . 4 # Please take action on the lines indicated in para 3 above and report the results to G.H*Q» PKRSXA AND IRACj yOi.^lAdD in three weeks time. If the employees will NOT enrol to the extent or about 80%. the whole problem will have to be reconsidered. It is very much hoped that' this will NOT be necessary, as the other methods that would have to be employed are far less satisfactory. Venu.

GSO.II(Oil) It It I Meeting was called to discuss the enrolment and training 5APC0 personnel in Denial Work* The following were the main points discussed:- Mr. Ward Anderson outlined the attitude of the BAHREIN Petroleum Company towards the enrolment of the company employees in an armed force. He was still awaiting instructions from NEW YORK office as to the commitments of the company vis a vis the enrolled employees.^ It was anticipated that these instructions would be. received within a month.- 2 # Pending arrival of instructions from the NEW YORK office, Mr. Ward Anderson suggested that training of the 25 men (Canadian and ' British) who had already volunteered, should proceed v/ithout waiting to enroll them. No guarantee could be given that the company would compensate for an£ injury sustained during training. Major Crosthwait accepted the principle of training these men now to form a cadre for the training of the remainder of the employees when they were enrolled. It^ was considered that they should be protected by Army non-effective benefit during training and Major Crosthwait undertook to obtain confirmation of this before definite instructions to commence training were issued. American employees would also be represented on the cadre. Major Hewitt £gr* 00 c[ £0 approach employees and explain the implication of the schemes as might be necessary. 3 # It was considered that once the nature and scope of the work became known, as it would as soon as training commenced, there would be little difficulty in obtaining sufficient volunteers of all nationalities. Major Hewitt stated that he was willing to approach employees on the lines suggested in 2 Ind Div. letter, but he must oe in possession of full details of the terras under whicn\employees were to , be enrolled. 'Major Crosthwait said they would probablyvbe similar to &lt; those agreed for the-A.I.O.C., and he undertook to send full particulars to BAHREIN on his return to GHQ. b. \&amp; Mr. Anderson enquired whether the company^ contractual position with regard to the men would be affected. For instance, normally an unsatisfactory employees was discharged. If he was enrolled,, would the company be forced to retain his services ? Major Crosthwait explained that enrolment in no way affected the company^ contractual engagements until the men were called up. There would be no objection to a man going on leave or being discharged or repatriated on termination of contract because there was a special clause in the enrolment terms which stated that a man was only to be called up for service on the company^ properties or the place of his normal employment. Once he ceased to be resident in the company area, he would no longer be liable for service on these Denial Schemes. The company would of course keep GHQ. informed of the movement^of their employees. 5. ‘Possible difficulties in enrolling U.S. citizens in the British Forves were visualised. It was thought that U.S. and British Army rates of pay and benefits were different. Major Crosthwait said, he would obtain information on this point. It was considered desitable that all personnel should be enrolled under the same terms to prevent possible dissatisfaction due to different rates of pay, etc. This point would be further considered after American citizens had been _ _ approached, as special conditions to cover them were to be included in the terms of service. 6 . Mr. Ward Anderson expressed the wish that the company should be dissociated from enrolment, equipment and training of employees and that it should be entirely in the hands of the military. The \procedure at ABADAN was explained, and Mr. Ward Anderson said he would go into it further when he visited ABADAN in the near future. The principle of military responsibility was accepted for the proposed measures. 7 # Mr. Wakefield accepted the reduction in secrecy which woul result from enrolment and training of personnel and stated that the Sheikh would probably be informed officially of the measures proposed in due course. 8 . To sum ups- that they will be used only as n guides' and not' as operational • personnelmilitary parties are available. forwarded as soon as possible to enable canvassing to commence. BAPCO have sufficient information to enable an outline of their position to be given. prior to enrolment will commence provided British Army non-effective benefits are applicable.

Arrangements for protection of wells and plugging or junking in case of emergency seem to me adequate. Protection of stabilisa tion plant power station and Ras Tanura topping plant also appear satisfactory. Only one tank at Ras Tanura containing motor spirit is sheathed to half height but as plant is shut down and products other than crude are not at present required further work does not appear necessary. 3. CASOC management have been instructed by San Francisco not to submit any claims or statement of expenditure to represent ative Baghdad as this is regarded as American responsibility. no 4. There are/detailed plans for denial of surface equipment or stores. Nor is there any protection whatever against air attack or parachute or troop landing. 5. Management are fully conscious that denial preparations are not in line with arrangements in rest of Middle East. They attribute this (a) to lack of appreciation of general position by their Head Office which may be rectified by visit of member of their staff now en route to U.S.A. (b) to opposition by U.S. military authorities who regard Middle East Area as in British zone of responsibility although State Department are believed to be willing to give safeguards required. 6. Problem could readily be solved if Lend Lease aid were extended to Saudi Arabia on understanding that Allied instructors could be sent to organise protection of vital interests such as Dhahran and Ras Tanura.

Wakefield, Esq., His Britannic Ifegesty’s Political Agent, The Agency, Bahrein. Dear Sir, Please refer to your Secret Letter No. C/1734 dated 17th November 1942 regarding approval to proceed with certain protective work at our refinery. There appears to be an error in the estimated costs of doing the work involved. I am attaching a copy of a memorandum covering the conference with Mr. Bridgeman written by Mr. Fifer after Mr. Bridgeman 1 s visit to Bahrein; copies of this memorandum were given to Major Hills and it is my understanding that Major Landsworthy will take copies of it with him one of which will be given to Mr. Bowlby. Mr. Fifer f s memorandum refers to the position as of October 15th 1942. The present position is this; 1 . Work on the process tankage referred to in Item 1A will be completed within the next few days. 2 . Work on Item IB is proceeding - it was agreed during the above-mentioned conference to proceed with this work. 5 . Item 2A is almost wholly completed and wtk is progressing on Item 3A. 4. Item 3B has just been started. This is the work for which approval was desired. You will note that the estimated cost of this work is - $35,000 instead of L3,000 as mentioned in your — letter. It was agreed between Major Hills and ourselves to proceed with this work pending official approval since delay would have meant dislocation of the working force and approval appeared fairly certain 5. Item 30 has just been started. It was agreed between Major Hills and ourselves to proceed5. with this work in view of Mr. -Bridgeman*s (cont.) views in the matter expressed during his visit here and reflected in his telegram to London. 6 . Work has been started on Item 4A, consisting of nine inside tanks to full height at an estimated cost of §105,000, pending official approval. Here again, it was agreed between Major Hills and ourselves to proceed with this work since delay would have meant serious inefficiency in the working force. 7 . No work has been started on Items 5, 6, 7 and 8 and approval is not required at this time since, with the approval of Items 2A, 3A, 3B, 30 and 4A to full height, there is sufficient work to keep the force occupied for the next several months. It appears that Ivlf . Bridgeman presented the figures correctly in his telegram to London and that confusion has crept in from a different source. Pending the clearing up of this matter wepropose to go ahead with the work as described aoove and would appreciate your clarification of these points in due course. L W. P.

Item 2.A above, which has already been approved, will be completed as planned. It was tentatively agreed, subject to approval by the Petroleum Division, that items 3.A. 3.B and 3.C logically should proceed simultaneously and these be followed by 4.A and 4.B. These items, together with the work already approved, will require approximately six months to complete. A decision on whether the main tank field tanks will be sheathed full height will be returned with this approval, which is required by November 15th in order not to hold up work. It was agreed that the balance of the work would be left for reconsideration six months hence. II. Smoke Screen Equipment. The possibility of applying the procedure adopted at Abadan was suggested by Mr. Bridgeman. We supplied figures to indicate the number of burners and amount of pipe that would be required. This matter will be studied by the Petroleum Division. III. Off Shore Shipment of Coke. The possibility of shipping coke to India to relieve tanker space for liquid fuel was discussed. A memorandum presenting what could be done with present equipment, together with a copy of 'Memorandum - Coke Supply' dated 1st September, 1942 previously prepared for Capt. Boyd*s use, were handed to Mr. Bridgeman for his further use in connection with this problem. IV. Defence Accounting. The procedure we are using for Defence Accounting was- 3 - reviewed l&gt;ut no definitie decisions were obtained# However, lir. Bridgeman agreed that a recommendation to pay 8 200,000 'on account” as of 30th September, 1942 was in order and he indicated he would make a recommendation to the Petroleum Division to this effect. V. Supplies - Materials. The guest ion of difficulties being encountered in obtaining food and materials were reviewed. Mr. Bridgeman stated that he would look into the matter and see what could be done to assist us. Also, he agreed to look into the matter of obtaining 5 Trailer pumps for additional fire protection.

The Bahrain Petroleum Company have not, of course, bean shown this telegram, but when the figures contained in your telegram under reference were communi cated to them they became afraid that there had been a serious misunderstanding about the estimated cost of the works to which approval was being accorded. Major Hills thereupon informed them that the Company’s estimates contained in Mr.Fifer*s Memo randum of 18th October had been correctly telegraphed to London by Mr. Bridgeman and that therefore the Petroleum Department were aware of the true estimated cost of these works. 4# You will, no doubt, be able to elucidate the matter and enable me to reassure the Company about expenditure on these works.

The following are extracts which concern the Oil Companiess- ' 3. It should be borne in mind that, although an enemy will presume the existence of demolition schemes, the existence of these schemes,apart from their details, must be treated as / SECRE1 1 . Very great care must be taken that indirect is NOT made to these schemes in connexion with such'miift'^ers as v,, v wc appointments of officers, terms of service of volunteers, pay matters, casualty returns and other administrative matters. Special care must be taken that no mention of the existence of the demolition schemes in general, and oil denial schemes in particular, or of any matter from which their existence could be inferred is made to or in the hearing of nationa3sof Iraq or Persia or any other unauthorised persons. 4. In the case of oil denial schemes, the following special precautions will be observed (a) Oil Companies will only be addressed through J one official nominated by them, and then only on a D.O. basis. (b) 'Oil Denial' will always be deferred to as 'Oil Protection' when writing to or referring to the Oil Companies. (c) While it is realised that the training of a large number of volunteers militates against secrecy, every effort should be made to impress on them the need for secrecy. Their role will always be referred to as the protection of oil resources NOT denial. ' 3. The Oil Company officials nominated at the Eleventh Meeting of the Bagdad Petroleum Advisory Committee are A.

For simplicity and clarity, the same general outline as employed in the Petroleum Division’s list of financial sanctions was used. In general, the approved work is complete with the following exceptions (l) Sheathing of the 9 Innemost Tanks in the Main Tank Field to Full Height - Item II(a IT is nearly complete. The remaining five have all been started and are in various stages of completion. Considering this item as a whole, it is approximately 55^ complete. With a force capable of laying 3,000 c.f./day it would require 30 working days to complete this item. (2) Protection of Vital Refinery Plant - Item 11(c). various items of refinery plant have all been completed with the exception of - masonry, and with a force of 40 men (due to the congested condition of the equipment not more than 40 men could be usefully employed) would require 30 working days to complete. We interpret the second paragraph of Mr. Bowlby’s letter as meaning that further work on the uncompleted approved items should be discontinued. We are, therefore, rounding off the work and all activities including cleaning up will be completed within 10 days.

As I had received no previous intimation that he was visiting Bahrain I enquired from you whether you had any information about him. As you also had received no intimation of his visit, I sent for the Officer. His identity card showed that he was Major Lester S. Thompson, No. 0-501548, Corps of Engineers, and he was travelling under the authority of Movement Order No. AG 300.4 issued bn 3rd July by the Adjutant General, P.G.S.C. 2. As his papers were in order and he had authority from the P.G.S.C. to visit Bahrain I afforded him all faci lities to visit the Oil Camp etc. I suggest, however, that arrangements should be made for advance intimation to be sent to you when officers of the U.S. Army visit Bahrain as is done in the case of British Military Officers. This would save visiting officers much embarrassment and myself the necessity of satisfying myself about their bona fides. Political Agent, Bahrain*SSCES?* V AtoII. 10th.

Briefly the scheme recommended the oiling of the ground and refinery structures so as to merge in colour and tone with the palm grove to the NORTH and the construction of a dummy refinery to the SOUTH. .Your report dated the 28 April ’42 recomended that the construction of the dummy refinery should be shelved. I have not yet been able to ascertain whether you,receive^ a reply to this proposal, but it is not intended that tno propo&amp;a-l should be ^ implemented unless strong reasons exist for doing so.

This office no: 2509/ll/G(C .') of Hay '43 was in the nature of an advisory letter on the method of maintenance. It was not intended to be an order.

Tha advent of Italy into the »ar brought danger nearer, and even aora so did Japan 1 a intervention and her rapid successes. In 1941 Italian ’planes made a feeble raid on the Befinery, but no damage was done, and the raid would appear to have been nore in the nature of a gesture than anything else. ’^arly in 1942 however, the position began to deteor* late. Japan had gained great successes, and brought all the Indian Ooean ( and consequently the Persian fltalf ), into the danger none* In Europe and Africa, the Axis Forces were doing well, and for a tine. Indeed, the 8.*. end of the Oulf appeared to be in great danger from land Forces. As it happened, the gallant defence put up by Russia stove off this danger. The ‘Bahrain Petroleum Company - usually known as BAPCO « ^*ad taken certain protective measures, in some cacea even before the '%r started. Special Police had been enrolled to deal with Sabotage, protective works had been put in hand in the 'fields' 1 , and se the War progressed, activity on these works woo incron^od, md el** - * eer^nin rather elementary camouflage wfrrks were carried out. The position of the Company wa* not an easy one. It Is officially a ^ritieto Company* being registered in Canada, but Capital, hireetion nnd Management are primarily American. %rther, Bahrain itself is not a Britlidi Protectorate, but an independent Arab state, with a Treaty with Croat Britain which gives certain mutual advantages to both countries, including the rig ht of 0roat Britain to control the foreign Policy of the f'tate. BA~W), therefore, with all good reason, insisted that all directions with regard to Military BorPs etc., should oome through lolitleal Ohannels, vis., through the olitioal Agent on unstruciatno from Mndon. ring the first two/ears of the iir, t« Company wem^vl eited by numerous Army and Air ®oree officers, who made recommendations and gave instructions about works to be put in hand, but who appear to have overlooked completely the Political aspect insisted on by the Company. Bot only did these Visitors ignore this important point, but it would appear that their H.o’s also overlooked it, for up to April 1942, no effort was made to put the various recommended schemes on the proper Political basis. The result was therefore, that in the Spring of 1942, the Oil Installations on the Island were only in a small degree protected. These constant visits and the attendant soimf&amp;mt Irresponsible yacoar?e»d*tIons, had the unfortunate effect of antagonising local officials of the Campcaqr to mme extent. The latter maintained, and rightly, that their lob for the war Sffbrt was to produce oil as rapidly and as efficiently as pos?ible| md to that end all their efforts should go, and all their stocks v e conserved; and it mm was only aeturel th*t as practical business men, they should find it ' Irksome constantly to have orders given by Officers who did not appreciate their outlook, and especially so as frequently these orders were entirely contrary to those given by previous visitors. Ikxring the Winter of 1941-1942, and the Spring of 1942, leading men of the Company were regularly attending meetings of the Iraq and Parsia Biv slon of the London Ret^oleum Board, held in Baghdad, but still the situation remained obscure.

The Officers were given two air-conditioned bungalows in which to livej the !?• ’•O’s were accomodated in air- conditioned quarters and Messed in the Company Mess Halit and the Iraqis were lodged In one of the Company Coolie Canos about 14 miles ffesm the Refinery. The Company had already started crushing rook for aggregate, and collecting sand, and 1000 tons of oement had arrived from Basra# while the work of moving out Vie tank stairways was also in hand. I'ork started at 7*00 a.n. on 20th. May. The organisation wae as follows?- the actual work was tho responsibility of Vie Company, subject to the decision of fills. Major points of policy (and there were many) were considered by Ward Anderson, mer and Bills, and when a decision was reached. Hills informed his H.c# and the l^litloel Agent, asking for sanction. Minor decisions of policy were agreed by Anderson, Fifer and Hills, the latter informing the Political .Agent. The Company’s technical man ©n the works was Mr. B. kaneehert, and their outside man on the Job was Mr. Fuddell. Both these appointments were particularly happy, and the Military Staff worked on excellent terms throughout with these gentlemen. fr.

Thirdly, the -orks generally. Aid not seem to have Quite the whole-hearted approval of the fofipsay.

It is possible, too, that the preeenee in the Army De^ehment of practical men who net on *T kn«* their job, but also a?^precioted the administrative and difficulties of the Company, Aid something towards bringing full under# ,Rnding and co-operation into being. In any case, by early July, the wo? k# were going well and complete harmony existed. „ , Meanwhile, there had been an important development, following a cable from London, Mr. Bowlby visited the Island in the middle of Juno. He was concerned with the one obvious flaw in the scheme, nameljr, that all tanks '-ere equally importont. He stayed V ilfi numerous inspections, and had oonferenoes 1th the political Agent, l^s leading men of the Qompamy and Fillsj and before he left, it was decided to aorap the original idea of doing *** * Hri *** eqaeliy in tnre» svages, and to substitute the completion of to# Proems# Tanks ( numbering nearly 50, very congested, and all adjacent to the refinery ), followed by the completion of certain othes tanks, with remainder left as la^ p^orlty. #o in the i^^tme, a change wa# made, and work was concentrated on the Process tankage.

In December 1942, Fills visited Baghdad and had conferences with Brigadier Wirris and Hr* Bcwlby. The former argued that in view of the war situation then prevailing, and the future probabilities, work on i?*A. *i. should be stopped! especially as the vital area, vis*, the Process Tanks, were complete. A recommendation to this effect was sent to G*H*Q* &gt;aiforce and to London. Hills returned to Bahrain at the end of the month. ftarly in 1943, instr uctions were received that no further stores would be sent to Bahrain, but that work should continue as far as possible with ^tooke in hand and indigenous materials.

File No.048.11 Dear Sir, Prompted by the improvement in the military situation and the removal of the threat of enemy invasion to the Island, the Company wish to apply for pemission to rehabilitate a certain number of the wells which were plugged in the first stage of the Oil Denial Scheme. I will be glad, therefore, if you will pass this request to the competent Political and Military Authorities. The rehabilitation of these wells is required for the purpose of improving the distribution of withdrawal from the reservoir and the observation of essential data which have been forgone as a result of the Denial Scheme. These requirements are a prerequisite to good operating practice upon which the ultimate recovery from the Field is greatly dependent. In making this request at the present time the Company has in mind the limited manpower at their disposal for carrying out this special ized type of work and is therefore anxious to make an early start in this important phase of activity. The proposed program, involving less than half the number of wells which were plugged, is estimated to take approxi mately one year to complete with the available personnel. cc: GEM File 048.11 Prod.

The present programme of well rehabilitation which the Company intends to follow and which involves approximately half the number of wells which were plugged in the first stage of the Denial Scheme, is estimated to extend over a period of at least one year. Available manpower does not permit an immediate start on this programme and rate of progress will depend entirely u^on the number of men that can be obtained for this specialized type of work. The time needed to revive denial measures will be governed by the progress made in the programme at the time such revival is deemed necessary but, subject to adequate warning, the time required per well would be approximately the same as in the original Denial Scheme i.e. an average of two days per well.

U' POLITICAL AGi BAHRAIN. -i ' 1 | ibe expected, in time of emergency, to carry out its duties in a disciplined manner provided that women and children from Awali had been successfully evacuated first, and that Major Kewitt would be the most suitable officer to undertake recruiting work. 2. At 12.15 p.m. on the same day further discussions were held at which Mr. Ward Anderson, Mr. Crow and Captain Swettenham R.E. were present in addition to the officers who attended the preliminary discussion. Mr. Anderson indicated what he believed would be the Company* s probable policy in regard to treatment of the members of the pro posed unit. The three important points which he mentioned were (1) an employee joining the unit would not lose the vacation which he had already earned (2) the Company would undertake repatriation of employees who were not repatriated by the Army (3) during the period that the members of the unit were actually called up and serving - subject to a limit of, say, 3 months - the Company would make up to them the difference between their Army pay and the pay which they had previously been receiving from the Company. Mr. Andersoi made it quite clear that his principals in New York had not yet laid down any policy and that he could not commit them in any way. He was fairly certain, however, that they would agree to the concessions'mentioned above. 3. Mr. Anderson proceeded to enlarge on the diffi culties which he believed would arise in the recruitment of Americans to a British Army unit. He had no doubt that Americans would gladly volunteer for service in a unit of the American Army but he was not certain v/hether they would agree to join the British Army. A further important point was that the terms of service in the American Army are much more liberal than-those in the British Army.In so far as pay was concerned there would be^ultimately, no difference between the pay of American^ and British members of the military unit since the Company would make up the pay of all of them to what it was during their civil employment. In regard to pension and disablement benefits, however,there would be a substantial difference between American Service and British Service terms. Mr. Anderson seemed to think that the Americans would expect pensions and disablement benefits on the scale of the American Army, and Major Crosthwait promised to ascertain what these were. The same difficulties arose in connection v/ith the Canadians employed by the Company, and Major Crosthwait promised to find out also what were the terms of service of officers and men serving in the Canadian Army. 4. Mr. Anderson stated that the position was further complicated by the presence of CASCO operating on the mainland. He thought that BAPCO employees would question the usefulness of the elaborate oil denial measures being taken in Bah rain if something on similar lines were not done on the mainland. 5. Mr. Anderson intends to go to Abadan in about a fortnight’s time. He suggested that consideration of the scheme should be postponed until his return as (a) he would make a number of relevant enquiries while at Abadan and (b) his New York principals might well have answered by the time of his return some of the questions that he had put to them in a letter which he wrote to them in August. 6. The suggestion that action should be further delayed was not welcomed by those present at the conference. After some discussion it was decided that the training of the persons who have already volunteered (some 28 or 30 in number) should begin shortly without formal enrolment. This training will be given by Captain Bale^and, before it began^a few Americans would be approach ed in the hope that they would join the trainees. 7. Major Crosthv/ait undertook to send shortly3$j) - h-jn I3&gt; (a) enrolment papers with detailed terms of service Cb) details of non-effective benefits and (c) authorisation for these non-effective benefits to be applicable during the period of training. On receipt of these documents, and particularly (c) above, training would begin with a nucleus .which, it was hoped, would expand as interest was roused. 8. The question of informing the Shaikh of what was happening was not discussed at this conference. It is clear, however, that as soon as training with explosives begins rumours will begin to circulate in the Island; and I think that the Shaikh should be informed confidentially of what is intended before local gossips become too busy. 21/9/42. ^ uJcj i~JKL (dlL I'l'-j •Oh £-■ I;oUej on Jlscussion vvi th t,he political :t. cri 'uii^ xSt»li ^cLolDdi 1 • ■ O Xv ^&gt; o /Jiaa. •i UU-L1C S fc « C Hi* 1CT/ Ooiilpaiij « % i informed the Resident that it was intended to make use of the British Military Police at present under the orders of the Defence Officer should any disturbances occur between the Construction personnel a nd wh e local p 0 pUo.at 2 . 0 n* The Resident agreed that it was undesirable to embroil the local police with Europeans and Americans and that the Cervices were really responsible for preservation of law and order among people, ie*, con struction personnel, whose sole reason for being in Bahrain was the most speedy prosecution 0 uhe war* . ^ w— 1C—43 2y,o -^.rvA»—v- few.

The principal correspondents in the file are: the Political Agent in Bahrain (Edward Birkbeck Wakefield); the Chief Local Representative for BAPCO (Ward P Anderson); members of the Corps of Royal Engineers and the British Tenth Army. The file is a direct chronological continuation of ‘File 28/1 K II Defence of oil field and refinery’ (IOR/R/15/2/662).The file includes:correspondence relating to proposals for an oil denial scheme at the oil refineries owned by the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC) in Saudi Arabia (ff 2-4);correspondence related to the ongoing construction of Passive Air Defences (PAD) at the BAPCO refinery in Bahrain, chiefly in the form of protective brick sheathing for oil tanks, and blast- and firewalls (f 37, f 87), and the costs of the programme (ff 21-22, ff 52-53, ff 62-64, ff 112-113); a ‘Report on PAD works at Bahrain Island, 1942-1943’, written by Major S Hills, Royal Engineers (ff 149-157);correspondence relating to the progress of the oil denial scheme in Bahrain, including: revisions to the scheme (ff 5-6); updates on the status of secured wells (f 9); enrolment and training into the British military of BAPCO personnel (ff 17-18) and liability in the event of injury/death, including a copy of extracts from the ‘Royal Warrant for the Retired Pay and Pensions, etc., of members of the Military Forces disabled’ (ff 40-44); extension of the denial scheme to Sitrah and Zellaq (f 34);correspondence in early 1943 relating to the decision to ‘round off’ PAD work in Bahrain, and to stand down the oil denial demolition scheme, as a result of the perceived reduction of the threat to Allied oil installations in the Persian Gulf (f 85, f 115, f 117);correspondence in July 1943 relating to the risks posed to oil facilities by an attack from an enemy submarine, after an ‘incident’ off the Oman coast (f 127);correspondence in 1943 relating to camouflage measures at the oil refinery, and the ‘oiling’ of roofs and certain landscape features to prevent aerial recognition (ff 137-140);in the latter half of 1943, correspondence relating to requests from BAPCO to rehabilitate those oil wells that were temporarily decommissioned (or ‘plugged’) as part of the oil denial scheme (ff 158-171).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Chief Local Representative</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Engineers</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>ʻAwālī</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Oilfields</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum refineries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military demolition</topic></subject><subject><topic>Air raid precautions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000038#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
