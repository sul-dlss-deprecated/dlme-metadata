In the course of the autu&amp;n several agricultural experts euce here from Tehran to advise landownere and othere on the choice and siting of their crops and on the planting* 0 V 1 u m. a. At the beginning of the year (14«V) it unoinoed that the CJOTenaient monopoly woUld buy all opi* direct from the grower thus relieving the letter of the riek and reapossibility of finding a btger.

The retail nrioe of prepared opium is rials le5o a mlseal which shows a slight rise compared with year 1 s prices probably due to increased excise duty, a. yhere are some 25 shops in the town in which the smoking of opium is officially allowed. Judging from personal observation the oonsunytion of the drug ^ people is still general being either smoked or eaten. A rough estimate of the daily oonsunption for the town of Kerm nshah alone is d5 lbs. For the whole province the yearly oonsunytion has been estimated about 63 kharvars which shows that the monopoly must be a profitable one to the Government for only a very small proportion is contra band oplun.* 6 . Industry* a. Like everywhere else in Iren Kerman shah has now its loottl industries t oil refining and sugar refining* b* The xermaishsh refinery of the Keraanshah letroleon Ooniiany which has been under construction since 1934 f was opened by the Priiie Minister in October, 1995, and is now working to full capacity* Oil cones by a 9' yifce at sene 1,500 lbs* treasure from the field at Maft-i- Shah a distance of about 145 miles with a rise of 9,000 feet * In the refinery it is treated to hmwximm give petrol, paraffin, fuel oil and g^s oil* The cost of the ^lant is believed to hare been about £750,000* o. The 'throughout' c%uoity is 7o,000 gallons a day while the output of the oil packing plant is about ?,000 tins* Bulk depots for the storage of oils have been built at Haaadaa, Malayyir, Kasvin, Tehran and Tabris and are in course of construction at various other important points through northern Iran. These depots are fed by a fleet of about do Leyluid tank lorries of different si ses* This x is supplemented by a number of contractors' lorries to which the company have fitted their own tanks* d. It is understood that thsre is some possibility of the plant being extended as at present, six months after it began working, the demand for its products is such that it is working to full capacity thus leaving no an reserve for future increases in demand* The reason for this is thought to be wo* das tn a miscalculation of Russian com petition in the North of Iran* e« The Shahabad sugar refinery, which has been built by the Shah as part of his plan for developping his estatesestate* in that Area, was formally o k eneu by the irime Minister on the day after the X«nnanahah oil refinery had been opened. f • Said to have opst something in the neigh bourhood of g900 f 0&lt;X&gt; this factory prodooed about l f foo tons of refined sugar this ye&lt;*r, the beet treated giving a sugar yield ©f l£f • g. Its potential output is unknown as estiaates are unreliable and at present it is ieprobable that for a year or too there will be enough beet to enable it to work at foil pressure for any length of tine* The period of activity this year was only ubout a month* The sugar ^roaueed compares very well with the iiussisn product, sweet ening better and being of finer grain* h* other industries in the district may be said to be entirely non-existent* At Hauadan there is carpet weaving, a small flour mill - a British installation - and also tanneries, but nothing on an industrial ao-U.e«, with the possible exception of carpet weaving* i« This trade swat continued badly during the past year* The Suitanabad branch of the oriental Jarpet k an of act ur era, Ltd, the largest concern * in the business, was closed down and the sole remaining weaving shed at Hanadan was never more than threJparts full at any time* At the end of the year 1314 a Government monopoly of c«irpets w ui Anno diced but it Has not, at the time of writing this report, begin to function and so no appreciation can be made* It is, however, believed that its institution la not looked upon with any great favour by the foreign carpet buyers in Europe and America who fear that they may no longerlonger be *ble to get juat what the* went but m ^ h^ve to t:»ke whut they are given* un the other hand thie yoint i« realised by those ree^nsible for the internal organisation of the monopoly who he** to arrange things so that the btyer who wants Sarouqs will still be able to get then and in hie f wo write patterns and the sa»e with other ^awes*of no little prido and iwteiration on the ysurt of the Ker- maishahi. The fad that the Company now uaea only British lorries and British motor oars for its requirements not be without its effect in the course of time. It is too early to say yet. As things are now the American has a monopoly of the motor oar market and there is no doubt that his product is better suited to local requirements than such examples of British oars as have up till now ap^ared here. e. With regard to motor tyres it is probable thid the early mishaps whioh Bunlops have had with tyres for the 1 tffge tank lorries of the oil company will hinder such efforts as they may m?4ce to regain the Iranian market since it will be the eeoond bad advertisement which they have had in the last few years t even thijgh it was more due to a wrongly chosen tyre else than to inherent faults in the tyre structure. f, in the bicycle field 9 a try to which the Iranian is readily though unsteadily taking 9 British products seem to hold the market well. &amp;ales in german shah and Ha&amp;adan must be increasing rapidly for the number of maehinea registered fcae increased very fast curing the last year or two and looks like continuing to do so.Russian Intere«t« Husflian oommeroial oompetition does not make Itself felt here as much as in Hamadan as Kermanshah is on the edge of the Russian area* Nevertheless Russian goods are always to be found in the basaar though in anall quantities compared to Japanese* b. Russian paraffin is still obtainable in snail quantities but the subtly is uncertain* It is considered by the locals to a better product thoU that of the An^lo- Iranian oil Company• Ltd« # whioh bums very dirtily • Russian petrol is for all prieticil purposes unobtainable* o. There is now no Russian oosimeroiai organisation in Kermanahah*a, far the effects of oicne^ljr traOlng do not seegi to have become very notieeahie here. t&gt;* A *ugar selling oeae w *&gt;igr agency which wae established here .at the end of the year idlb failed oonpletet ly as no one would h*4y from it, being euy^crtedi no doubt, by the smugglers. e* A cotton *ieoe goods jsaono;cly selling agency was also established early in the year but Is not very successful mainly owing to the fact that traders preflsr to go to Tehran and make their choice there. d. The only monopoly which has really made itself felt has been the groin concern. As soon as it started operations in the si®mcr the price of native bread rose slightly end the quality was said to have deteriorated , while a certain number of bakers* shops were dosed down by the authorities. Later on it be©**© dear that the monopoly was by no meuns buying all the grain on offer, possibly owing to its difficulties in finding sufficient storage space. e. The carpet monopoly though introduced before the end of the year had not yet had any effect here since there is very little local weaving done and Ktrmanshah is not in any way a oar pet market.(s 39 • taxation. Yh© Government being hard put to it to find fund* f$2 to oover its large expenditure on non-iXoduative objects the burden of taxation continued to weigh heavily* in fact, it be said to have increased if only by virtue of the fact that the ooileetion of taxes by the authorities is beoooiing more efficient and very few loopholes for evasion remain* b, X good deal of muncaring can be heard among the people who many of them admit to seeing little return for their money, at any rate in these ?arts. !&amp;paid arrears are also being mercilessly extracted* This can be seeii from the figures for the years* tax revenues which area- estimated tax revenue for Kenamshah town and province for 1314, 13,000,000 rials Actual revenue, , 9,600,000 rial* (Of this 8,900,000 rials are uaderstood to have oeme from the town alone)• Actual revenue for 1813 2,?0C,QC0* 0, During the^year the petrol and paraffin excise duties were increased, except for the first few week* after the increase f ^he burden was largely borne by the oil company. d. The new scale of income tax introduced last y&amp;,xr wa* in operation a* was th* tax of S^! on all produoe of | tho soil which was introduced to replace all former assess ments.

At the beg liming of Mareh the Iranian Government introduced ILcC a Foreign exchange Control Law model on the exchange cont rol of 1931 forbidding all exchange operations except X through two authorised bulks, the Imperial B&lt;mk of Iran and the National Bank; ^exmlssion had to be obtained from a specially created ^xch;mge Osamlssion to biy any foreign exchange but valuta could be sold to the two banks at any time at. the fixed rate of rials 8c to £1* Severe I r tenuitiesfc eu^ltiee ueen ^roLilseU for those caught dealing on the 'black bourse* and though here one started for a few daps! quoting rites round about rials 90 to 95 to gl it soon closed down owing to fear of discovery* In Haaadsti too• a 'black bourse* was functioning tor a time and quoting as much as rials llo to Si* \s most of the ex change business both hers and in Hasadan is in the hands of Baghdadi Jews it is probable that t illieit exchange transactions will become centralized in Baghdad* 0* During most of the year there was a snail but steady flow of snuggled silver finding its way out of Iran to Baghdad but this has ceased since the world ffiee of the metal dropped* Bpoe April, 1^35, until about Deeember, I9b5, Iranim silver coins stood at a prsniun of about 12? over paper and at one tine, when the paper rial rate was 49 to £l the silver rial rote had fallen to 42.

The Karmanshah aerodrome to the eaat of the town was in regular use during the dry part of the year by the Anglo-Iranian oil Oompany, Ltd. aeroplanes and by one or two other passing aircraft* No real effort has been made by the military authorities to whom it belongs i to develop it in any way except for the marking of the boundaries by white flags. There is axjai no proper road to it* In dry weather these are quite minor disadvantages but if the projected airmail service between Tehran and Baghdad hopes to operate all the year round something will have to be done in the way of drainage as f being at the lowest point of ths Ker- manshah plain all the drainage from the surrounding hills runs on to it* 4 new aerodrome has also been laid out at Hanadan, at Casimabad to the north east of the town. This, too, looks as if it would be very soft in wintsr and no drainage works have been undertaken. 1* The post aL and telsgraph services worked quite well during the year though letters between xermsishah a d Ham ad an are still apt to take longer to reach their destin ations than letters between icerm anshah end Tehran.

Social. a* Though the aubhoritiee are making great effort* to improve the lot of the people each efforts are in nearly every case purely external in the application and it can safely be said that the people are in no way better off than a year ago* Taxation is high, and prices are tending to rise on the monopoly bviable so it is becoming increasingly difficult for middle-class and *cor families to a^ce suds meet* b* education, of which so much is to be read in the Tehran press, is certainly being extended but it has become, for the average Ir anian of the servant or cierk class, a very heavy drain on ius family budget* School children have now to have several uniforms for different purposes and the authorities change their mind frequently as to the type so that the mfortunate father has to pay about twice as much as he need have done had things been better thought out* Books, too, are becoming an expensive item, again paid for by the pupil* o* The abolition of the womens veils meant very heavy expenditure, it being reckoned that, even for a ferrash or ghuL&amp;t, a woman's new outfit would cost about rials 4oo* In jCermunshah, too, the authorities did not seem to be ai&gt;le to do anything to prevent profiteering* d. Nothing has been done here to improve the public health and there is still no other hospital than that of ths A&amp;erioan mission* Last year disease was not quite so pre valent as usual owing to the dryness of the sunmer* e* The erection of ill-deeigned and flimsy new houses throughout the town continues as does the cutting of wide46. *• On certainly, the goYernaent’t tlane for agricultural and other eorte of deyeloimentK sound good but it it probably a different matter in practice. The introduction of the cultivation of beet, for invtance, which is incurring now m a large scale here does not a; pear to make any allowance for the fact that beet cannot be grown on the same ground definitely. Ueo the mm who uaed to grow a mixed cro t ever, year and live on seoie of it will now find himeelf worse off rather than better for growing entirely beet or cotton, as he will have to bring in hi# winter food su^ies from a distance instead of being able to grow them by his home. Things nill no doubt come right for him in time but for the u t &amp;&amp;&amp; few years he may find himself the sufferer on t account of busty governmental enthusiasm. It seems to be hasty and ill-advised planning ^ which causes most difficulties both for ray at and government. The latter wishes at all costs to get its scheme going and have something to show. Thd* the preparations are skimped with ill effects later. For extuule, shshabad, the centre of the liBfrerial estates f whieh is being of necessity forcibly developed since no one will go there of his own free will rould probably be voluntarily developed if only the author ities had taken some steps in the oegiimjung to render the district less malarial, put that ;&gt;rocess, as it did not entail putting up buildings which could be seen, was not con sidered of much importance.

The Department of Overseas Trade sent us this, their only spare copy of the report, with the suggestion that we should pass it on to you when we had read it, since they thought that you might perhaps be interested in certain sections such as that on page 10 relating to the tea trade. I fear that owing to pressure of more urgent Persian work we have been rather slow in acting on this suggestion, but the substance of the report is chiefly of retrospective interest. If you do not particularly want to retain it, we should be glad to have it back eventually. J. G.

This department has no knowledge of any such report, but it is believed that the passage in question may be contained in His Majesty's Consul's Commercial Diary, which he prepares for His Majesty's Legation at Tehran and for the Government of India. It is understood that the Government of India sometimes circulate the Diary through the Department of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. 2. His Majesty's Minister at Tehran has been requested to furnish a report as to the circumstances in which the alleged misstatements were published, and to instruct His Majesty's Consul not to reply direct to the Ottoman Bank, but to forward any observations to His Majesty's Legation. o. I am however to suggest that tnis matter should also be brought to the notice of the Government of India in order that it may be ascertained whether the extract of which the Bank complains was issued in that country.

The statements have been read by us wita astonishment, and are in many respects either totally incorrect or misleading. As your Heport is circulated to British firms both in Iraq and in Persia, we believe, the misstatements in your remarks are important and I am instructed to request an early reply to this letter.

This Ban*, having no capital in Persia appears to finance itself by (1) money received from customers on current account and fixed deposit, on which it pays interest much in excess of the rates quoted by the Imperial Bank of Persia. (2) Selling three months’ paper on London, using the proceeds to buy usance bills up country or discounting local paper. (3) Selling to the Imperial janx of Persia considerable sums on Hamadan, Teheran and Sultanabad. and with the proceeds buying long usance bazaar paper on those places or discounting long usance bills. The Imperial Banx of Persia will not deal with long date paper and generally limit the risks to 31 days. It is curious to note that the Ottoman Bank always pay consular fees by cheque on the Imperial Banx of Persia.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000026_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3482</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000026</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3482</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/78 ‘Persia.
