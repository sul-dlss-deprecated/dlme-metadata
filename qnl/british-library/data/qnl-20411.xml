Of course difficulty is that the Hule r of Kuwait looks upon matter as affecting his honour, and he feels that Bin Saud's demands, as they stand, infringe his sovereign rights. My personal view is that, unless ibn Saud makes sub stantial counter-offer^ - such as giving back Awazim tribe or conceding his territory and a general approach to the Shaikh in a more con ciliatory spirit than formerly, the latter will reject efforts for friendly settlement and only course will be for His Majesty^ Cjovernr/«nt t© act as arbitrator or defend his interests. Meanwhile, i see no objection to jeddah's dis* cussing matter informally; but deprecate any negotiations being started before autumn, when conditions in Hasa will have become stable. Belief exists at present that Ajman intend creating serious trouble. (b) ibn Saud might be asked to define his meaning: Kuwait only too anxious to improve trade facilities with JNajd but His Majesty stands in the way. (c) I see no reason for change of stat us quo in Kuwait. (d) I am entirely averse to proposal if appointment of flajd Consular agent is meant: xf we cannot keep out foreign consuls here and else where if once we concede this point. .Present system of unofficial agent is working well and is liked by the Shaikh.

This concession, which was forced on Shaikh of Bahrain by British Government, involves State in loss of over lakh of rupees yearly. Any further concession would be resisted by State. In Kuwait the question of cus toms dues on articles destined for Nejd is problem of first magnitude.' Bin Saud would have to approach it in much more accommodating spirit than he has hitherto shown. It is possible that, if Bin Saud makes concession in matters such as control over Awazim tribe. Shaikh may be willing to re-open question which at present he considers to touch his honour and his sovereign independence. (h) Facilities for trade not injurious to themselves would be welcomed by boili Bahrain and Kuwait. It is Bin Saud and not the Shaikh who puts obstacles in the way of trade between Kuwait and Nejd. (c) In ignorance of specific points it is hard to reply. Najdis passing through Bahrain are usually in possession of passports signed by one of Bin Sand's Amirs which are brought to the Political Agent, who endorses them to certify the genuineness of the. signature of the Amir and grants his visa. About fifty visas for India, Iraq, Kuwait, etc., are granted monthly. Najdis not in possession of passports can easily obtain them at Oatif, which is distant four hours in launch. This involves much less inconvenience than is caused to in tending travellers in big country like India. At request of Bin Saud the Political Agent assumed jurisdiction over his- subjects in Bahrain.^ Government of India have already, in letter to this Resi dency, expressed their willingness to allow the Shaikh to deal with them. I suggest that Consul be informed that, if Bin Saud desires, Government of India are willing to restore jurisdiction over Najdis to Shaikh of Bahrain but to no third party. (&lt;7) At all costs proposal to*appoint Najd official represontative to either Bahrain or Kuwait should be resisted. Bin Sand's present unofficial representa tive being trade agent is sufficient for all his legitimate needs. Any concession on this point must lead to similar claim from Persia and possibly from other- nations. N.B.—The objections to the appointment of an official Najd agent are clearlv set forth in enclosure to mv letter No. 112-S. of the 15th April 1929 (File No. 24-N.) on the subject of Persian consular representation at Bahrain.

I HAVE the honour to report that, in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 54 of the 18th May, the Acting Hejaz Minister for Foreign Affairs was asked to produce a memorandum setting forth the precise points His Majesty King Ibn Saud wished to raise in connexion with the Persian Gulf. 2. In his reply, a translation of which is attached, Sheikh Fuad Hamza states that the questions His Majesty wishes to raise are :— j. With highest respects. Yours sincerely, FUAD HAMZA. ^ * (1.) Customs and transit dues collected in Bahrein on goods imported into Nejd (2.) Certain points relating to the nationality and passports of Hejaz-Nejd subjects in the Persian Gulf. (3.) The position of Ibn Sand's agents in Bahrein and Koweit. 3. This note is couched,as was his previous verbal communication, in the vaguest terms, and throws little further light on the points previously raised. I am transmit ting it, however, as the bag leaves to-day, and I shall not have an opportunity of clearing the matter up with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. 4. The questions were not brought up for discussion during the course of His Majesty's short visit here. He left Jeddah yesterday for Mecca, and is expected to proceed thence in a few days' time to Riyadh and Hasa, where he will presumably remain until next spring. 5. It might therefore, under the circumstances, be as well to leave matters as they are, unless Sheikh Fuad returns to the charge, and I propose to await your instructions before taking any further action. 6.

The contention alpo of the Buler ' of Kuwftit if that thip pouthem boundary line wap approved of by the Tur^iph authoritiep when they were aa^terr of Haapa «nd it wap only in Shaiidi salin 1 ? day that jiin Baud Ptarted aa.cing olalaw againat Kuwait, and then only beoaupe of a peraonal feud| between the two oen, which ended in Shaikh Salioi building a fort at Baloul which threatened Juoe ii. (ainain). 8. It I p interepting to recall that Bin gaud at the Ojair Conference never laid claim to any part of Kuwait ter ritory ap far ap 1 recollect (I wap prepent on the ocoaPion), he claimed instead to be the chief of all the '^edia' i.e. beaouin tribes of Arabia, and as such where Kuwait war con cerned he deuanaed that the AJjoan, Mutair and Awasim should be ► considered to coae unaer his control, rhe first two of these » trices had alreaay been pursuaded to Join hia torougn the AKhwan movement, so, ap iiin Saud said, they were his already. ^ As for the Awaaia, these had oeen forced to go down to Hasse Just before Shaiich 1 ia 1 p death, by Bin daud's threat of attaoic and destruction, but had not become A^hwan and if allowe would return to their Kuwait allegiance, over the ^ueption of thlP tribe Jiuch heated arguaent took place, and speaking from aeaory l thinic that Bin aaud agreed to allow it to return to Kuwait if it chose to do po of its own free will, it never did; Bin Saud saw to that. According to His £xcellenci/ the dnai^h, he was facedwith 'ft Talt Aoooinpll' on the rotum of 3ir p«roy Cox from oj^lr, th# latter only then Informing hi a that ulr southern provlnoe h^d gone to B^n daud together with the Uut^lr and AJmn, and that hip boundaries Tor the future were to be as they exist today. The Shai/ch relfttea how he ^rojwted to Sir peray Cox, end getting no atemge re^r^ed 'I suppose you have given ay territories to Bin Saud beoeuse he if* the stronger and has the big sword** • Sir r ery Gox laughed and replied^Yes, but soaieday things aay ohange and then you will be able to regain what you have lost and nore**. ifhls is of oourse Shaikh Ah^aad's story, ana he tells it as an a&amp;using reoiinioenoe and adds M the sword oonquers today in spite of anything you English s^y**. I q . 1 trust it will be realised that I ata quoting Shai.^h Aiiiaad's point of view above entirely tnd have oonsulted no files or booics of reference. The point 1 wish to oa^e is that with the transfer of the Awazi-a, Mutair ^nd Ajroan, Kuwait has been rendered absolutely defenoelese. These triber imow her every weaimess and CVtrvM hex^ell, and as Achwan under Bin gaud have grown to look upon the walls of Kuwait aa the liUcLt of their sway, (and jain Baud has enoour^ged pnd fostered this ide ft to the best of his power). 11. This brings one to a still aore interesting point end one whijh oonaem* us olosely at the present iioaient: I refer to the policy of getting the Shaikh of Kuwait to invest in a fleet of light lorries amed ^ith Lewis (Juns for hir defence. Though the 3balxh bas expressed his readinesp to ao tne needful, he hss confided to me that he has no faith at ell in toe scheme, for he £no*s that rip own Kuweit townsmen who will nave to ^an the o^re will never iaa^;e fighters, t^nd ©s he admitted sadly to me recently, 'not 5Q cars manned by uy townsmen will be of the sligntest ufe if att^cKed by the A^hwans. All they will be able to do will be to police ay territories and de*l with ^etty raids'*.jeerson^lly I fe^r Shaikh Ahuad if* not far wrong in his estimate of the 'riffraff** whom he oalls his 'fidawi' forjes. I cannot see the car poheae becoming a sucoers until he either gets one of the above tribes bacic, or inports HMrope«n or XnciiAn mercenaries to nan his araed cars, ihe immense prestige which the desert A^hw«n have today vis-a-vis t*ae townsmen of Araoie ha^ only to be seen to be understood.

Frogi -- Ahmad al Jaoir as- Subah, 0. 3. I., Euler of Kuwait. To - Colonel E. R. P. Dickson, d. I. 15., H. B. ¥• s.] Political Agent at Kuwait. Dated - 27th Safar 1343 (3rd August 1929). After greetings and compliments etc., 'ith the hand of affection, I dulj received received hy you from the Hon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have noted the contents, and have understood what Kis Excellency desired to convey. I also aia grateful for the care and attention v/hich His Excellency has shown to me his friend. I therefore thank the High British Government lor its favour and kindness, and desire you to convey my gratitude and thanks to the Hon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. As for myself I am the loyal friend of His 1-aj est^s Governuient. As regards my 'brother Bin Saud you know very wel3 that there is no real enmity (Khasama) 'between him and myselr in anything, and I trust there never will he. The good relations existing 'between us are of a permanent nature, and where he is concerned I shall hy God*s will, endeavour with all the influence and power at my disposal to loyally carry out the wishes of His Majesty's Government, not only in word hut hy deed. Nevertheless I would request you to inform the Hon*Die the Political Resident of all the happenings ( that have befallen Kuwait ( at the hands of Bin Saud), of the Blockade of my territories, of the continual raids (gharat) of Bin Saud*s \khwan, and the attacks ty his regular forces (Saria) and all within the boundaries of Kuwait, and one and all heing acts 'acts of cruel persecution on my subjects of Kuwait contrary to all laws and my rights. I would further ask you to make report on the seizure of the goods exported for poor 3edouin trioes, whether these were taken out 'by their subjects or 'by the subjects of my or other states. All this and more is due to the strictness of (Bin Saud's) blockade of Kuwait, and 'to the activities of his forces near my city. To such an extent has trade 'between Nejd and Kuwait 'been interfered with that my revenue has 'been reduced fro^i its former figure hy 70^. This too has been brought about by Bin Saud's siege operations which have been going on without interruption from the year 1340 (1921) to the present time. There can be no doubt that such methods (of Bin Saud) bring grief to pure affection, and displease the best friendship. The present request of His Majesty's Government that I should put forward the proposals which I deem '* t suitable for solving the Kuwait-Nejd dispute) has given me very great satisfaction, and will further bring Joy and happiness to many. Nor can there be any dout^that this is due to the kindness and generosity felt by His Majesty's Government for their friend. It is of course unthinkable that T should go against the orders of His Majesty's Government in anything that is desired or approved of. To revert again to the attacks of the Akhwan and regular forces (of Bin Saud). I have bornCthese with patience, and have complained to Bin Saud on every single occasion that ttiey happened. But I regret to say that no restitution of my own stolen property, or that of any of my subjects has been made as yet. Moreover I j£ave been doing my utmost to meet Bin Saud in every single request that he has p^t forward or that would give him satisfaction. Nor can nor will he deny wh^twhat I say. Unrortunately I have received nothing in return to give me or my people pleasure. As regards Kuwait generally, we have not sufficient force or strength to defend ourselves from these continou attacks, seeing that our trihes and defenders were taken away from us, when 3ir Percy CJox reduced the territories and 'boundaries of Kuwait, how could they remain with us seeing that they no longer had sufficient room to graze their camels and flocks, whilst the constant fear of Bin Saud^ attacks hastened their going over to the other sid^ Had the territories of Kuwait today 'been as before and our trihes 'been with us we should not have importuned Eis Majesty's Government, 'but would have defended our own 'borders, and carried out any orders, that His Lajesty^s Government had cared to impose without in anyway aSKing ' for or expecting help. As things are, we can do nothing for we have no power to defend ourselves, whatever, therefore that which the Government sees fit to decide, must 'be accepted. I am now putting forward to Your Honour three statements, t he first includes the number of raids and attacks made 'by Bin Saud's Akhwan within the 'boundaries of Kuwait and the number of Kuwait subjects killed, and the amount of property stolen. The Second gives the number of raids made by Bin Saud's Regular Troops (Saria), also within Kuwait boundaries with property seized etc. The third gives in detail my proposals and demands vis-a-vis Bin Saud and which you have requested me to furnish. Whatever action His Majesty's Government decides to take or whatever line it approves of, that will be the right and propitious one. (Sealed).

[E 3703/66/91] July 24, 1929. Section 2. No. 1. Mr. Bond to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received July 24.) (No. 157.) Sir, Jeddah, June 26, 1929. I HAVE the honour to report that the British Air Mission under Wing- Commander F. W. Stent, which was sent here in order to ascertain the condition of the existing aircraft of the Hejaz Government, has now completed its work and is returning to Egypt to-day. 2. On the morning of his arrival, the 15th June, Wing-Commander Stent was introduced to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and arrangements were made for an interview with the King on the 17th June. Instructions had already been issued for all facilities to be given to enable the mission to begin its work at once. 3. At the latter interview the King asked various technical questions regarding the condition of the aeroplanes and their suitability, and he seemed anxious to obtain some idea of their possible utility. Wing-Commander Stent, who had had time to complete a preliminary inspection, was able to inform His Majesty, albeit unofficially, that the model had been out of date for some years, that the type was quite unsuited to the conditions of this country, and that, although one or possibly all of them could be made serviceable if spare parts were available, they could never be regarded as anything but practice machines. The King was quite prepared for this information, and stated that he had not expected any other verdict and had not considered the aircraft safe for flying. 4. His Majesty then went on to say that he proposed to establish two main air bases, one at Jeddah and the other at El'Katif, with intermediary bases at El Mueh, Sha'Ara and Riyadh. He did not for the present envisage the formation of any other air routes. 5. He then asked Wing-Commander Stent's advice as to the practicability of this scheme, and was informed by the latter that he saw no difficulty on technical grounds. 6. Wing-Commander Stent was careful throughout the interview to explain both to His Majesty and to Sheikh Fuad that his views could not be taken as either official or final.' I thought it as well, however, that, subject to the above reserve, he should discuss freely the questions put to him, and I asked him to do so. 7. In the course of the mission's stay here two aeroplanes were made serviceable. Several flights have been made, and during one afternoon the Governor of the town, aged about 60, and one or two Arab notables were taken up. They expressed themselves as delighted with the experience and amazed at the skill of the pilot. 8.

I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, h Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. A l (With 1 spare copy)•' —I &gt; P.6357. Letter from Colonial Office to India Office, dated 4th October 1929. Wo.69155/29. Downing Street, 4tli October 1929. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the letter from this Department of the 30th July (iTo.69006/225/29) I am directed 'by Lord Passfield to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a despatch and enclosures from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf communicating proposals for a comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions between the Shaikh of Koweit and King f ' * , Ihn Saud. j 2» J^rom Shaikh Ahmad 1 s letter which accompanies the Residents despatch, Mr. Wedgwood j^enn will ocserve that the Shaikh has taken the opportunity to submit claims in respect of raids carried out by King Ibn Saud's tribes into Koweit territory and to put forward other demands in addition to proposals for the settlement of the customs dispute which Lord Passfield had in mind wiien suggesting that the Shaikh should be informed that if he co-operated loyally with His Majesty^s Government at the present juncture, they would do what was possible to arrange a settlement with King Ibn Saud. 3. it might be argued that as the Shaikh of Koweit, unlike the Iraq Government, is in a position to correspond direct with King Ibn it would be preferable to leave him to settle claims for raids and kindred questions direct with that ruler. But, as the Shaikh / s himself points out, he has 'complained to Bin Saud on every single occasion when they (the raids) happened', but with no result what ever. His correspondence with King Ibn Saud has produced no compensation and has led to the restitution of none of the stolen property. There is some force in the view that, as His Majesty * s Government are to some extent responsible, owing to the frontier decision laid down at the Uqair Conference at which the Shaikh was not The Under Secretary of State, India Office.not present for his present a inability to protect himself against Akhwan raids, some moral responsibility rests upon them to do what is possible to obtain compensation for the Shaikh and his subjects. In the circumstances it would seem that His Majesty^ Government might properly support the Shaikh's claims to the extent of inviting King Ibn Saud to agree to their examination by a special tribunal of the nature contemplated in Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement. Such a suggestion might well be productive of no result, but it is possible that King Ibn Saud, faced with the prospect of a special tribunal awarding heavy compensation against Nejd, might think it preferable to settle out of court and to make some payment in the nature of a compromise, I am accordingly to suggest that the lists of raids into Koweit territory now furnished by the Shaikh should be communicated to King Ibn Saud by His Majesty's Government, with the suggestion that a tribunal similar to that provided for in Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement should be set up for the purpose of examining the claims for compensation arising therefrom. • 4. Turning now to the detailed proposals for a settlement contained in Statement 3 accompanying the Shaikh's letter, it may be doubted whether the suggestion for the solution of the customs dispute, in the form suggested by the Shaikh, would be acceptable to King Ibn Saud or would operate satisfactorily in practice. There seems nothing inherently unreasonable, however, in the Shaikh's proposal that King Ibn Saud should establish four customs posts at watering places within the Kov/eit frontier. Presumably the places suggested are situated I i upon the ordinary caravan routes from Koweit town in the interior. In its present form, however, the proposal would be open to the objection that it would be to the interest of caravans to avoid these posts in order to evade the payment of % customs duty to King Ibn Saud. And in order to overcome this objection it would clearly be necessary to eliminate this element of self-interest. 5. As Mr. Wedgwood Benn is aware, in the case of Bahrein a transit due of 2 per cent 4-^ is charged on goods enteringentering the island and subsequently being re-exported to ITejd-r It seems essential that the Shaikh of Koweit should, be brought to accept in principle the imposition of a similar transit due in the case of goods exported from Koweit to Eejd. If it could be arranged that the import duty charged by King Ibn Saud on goods entering his territories from Koweit were less than the import duty charged by the Shaikh of Koweit by at least the amount of the proposed transit due (for example, if the Koweit import due were 8 per cent, and the % Nejd import due 6 per cent, the difference representing the transit due) arrangements could, it is suggested, be made whereby the Shaikh would charge full import duty in the first instance upon all goods entering his territory, but would subsequently refund the balance over and above the transit due in respect of any consignment for which a caravan leader could produce evidence that he had paid import duty to a Kejdi customs post. By this means caravans into ITejd would have no interest in avoiding payment to King Ibn Saud^ customs posts, since they could subsequently recover the equivalent from the Shaikh of Koweit. Clearly, if the difference between the Koweiti and Uejdi import duties were greater than the transit due charged by the Shaikh of Koweit, there would be a definite incentive on the part of Nedji caravan leaders to pay Bejdi import duty. An alternative and possibly simpler arrangement would be for caravans leaders merely to hand over to the Hedji customs posts their receipts for the Payment of Koweiti import duty and for the Kejdi customs officials themselves subsequently to recover from the Koweiti Customs Administration the balance over and above the transit due. It seems probable that the absence of financial interest, coupled with the fear of condign punishment if caravan leaders were caught attempting to avoid King Ibn Baud's customs posts would be sufficient to ensure the reasonably efficient v/orking of the arrangement proposed. 6, The proposals in paragraphs 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of State ment 3 accompanying the Shaikh^s letter appear to be un exceptionable and such as might properly be supported by His Majesty^ Cover men t.7, i&lt;[t. Wedgwood 3enn will observe from Colonel Barretts despatch that the Shaikh has suggested a revision of the boundaries of Foweit to coincide with those laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. It seems doubtful whether any useful purpose would'be served by re-opening at the present state the question of the Koweit-Nejd frontier, and it is not recommended that any suggestion to that effect should be made to King Ibn Saud. It is for consideration, however, whether the Resident's suggestion that an attempt shouldjbe made to induce King Ibn Saud to return t Awazim tribe to the suzerainty X of the Shaikh of Koweit might not be adopted. While the Uqair Conference was in progress King Ibn Saud shov/ed himself quite willing to do this, but at that time the Awazim them selves preferred to remain under t his protection. In view of the inter-tribal conflict now prevailing in Kejd, it seems likely that the Awazim would be glad to transfer their alleg iance. The greater part of this tribe's habitat is either v/ithin Koweit territory proper or with the neutral zone. They were, as Colonel Barrett points out, originally a Koweiti tribe. They rank lev/ in the tribal heirarchy and consequently it is unlikely that King Ibn Saud would feel any strong objection to their loss. On the other hand, on occasion they have shown that they can fight reasonably well, and if supported by armoured cars, might be capable of protecting Koweit from Akhwan raids. 8. It is, moreover, of considerable importance to His Majesty's Government that the Shaikh of Koweit should be put in a position to defend himself without having to call upon the British Air Force and armoured cars. It seems possible that when Iraq attains to full independence the present Imperial garrison in that country may have to be reduced. If so, the British commander might find it embarrassing if he were required at any time further to reduce the strength of his force by detaching contingents to assist in the defence of Koweit. As pointed out earlier in this letter, ' : is Majesty's Governmen tGovernment can aa scarcely divest themselves of all responsibility for the present defenceless state of Koweit, and it is suggested that in common equity they should do what is possible to remedy the unsatisfactory position that exists in that territory today. 9. Lord Passfield would be glad to be furnished in due course with the observations of Mr. Wedgwood 3enn on the proposals now submitted by the bhaikh, and upon the considera tions advanced in the present letter. If, however, Mr. Wedgwood Benn considers that it would be preferable that these questions should in the first instance, be discussed orally between representatives of the Departments concerned. His Lordship would be happy to arrange for an inter-departmental conference to be held at the Colonial Office for that purpose. 10.

My telegram No.1205 of 28th November. I offer following coinments or. Colonial Office letter. In view of moral responsibility recognised as resting upon His Majesty's Government I trust it will 'be possible to press Koweit claims and method proposed would seem suitable. Customs Duties. This is chief bone of contention and in view of fact that as far as I am aware Bin Saud has not established customs posts on frontier of 'Iraq., Qatar or Trucial coast ports it is clear that he is subjecting Koweit to differencial treatment which is difficult.to explain except on ground of personal animus. Position at Koweit differr from Bahrein. There goods in transit are consigned to Nejd^do not break bulk^and have to be exported within 20 days. At Koweit all goods are consigned to Koweit merchants who take delivery and subse quently sell to caravans from the interior. Koweit customs duty is only 4%: as Najd customs duty would presumably not be less proposals in para 5 would not seem to be feasible. I personally can-not see why solution proposed by Sheikh should not operate satisfactorily. In summer there would be no possibility of evasion since caravans must water daily. In winter a caravan leaving beaten track would probably encounter serious difficulties but Sheikh would nai certainly agree to any reasonable extension of posts on frontier, and /and manifest system proposed 'by him would seem to provide still further against possibility of evasion, Finally I would emphaoise that caravans taking goods to Nejd are nottrihal caravans 'but camels and goods 'b long to Nejdi merchants. Bin Baud therefore can inflict severe punishment on offenders. Question of caravans really presents no difficulties 'but i iin Saud's real object is, 1 think, to prevent Bedoii-in trihes having access to PToweit for their ordinary supplies, which of course is different question. - RESIDENT - Post copy to the Political A^ent, Kuwait, By order, Capt,, for Secretary to the Political Pesident in the Persian GiUfo I.G.T.S, 'PATRICK STE^APT. 9th December 19P.9,(18) E ndorsement prom the P olitical R esident in the P ersun G ulf, NO. p .S .-u, dated the 15 th december 1929. r ,, A «.|iy of tile undermotitloned t.aj-er is forwarded to the Government of India m the Foreign and Political Department.

Despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Colonial Office, No. P.S.-9, dated the ISth December 1929. I have the honour to report that I have recently concluded a three davs visit to Kuwait, during which I had a long conversation with the Shaikh. 2. His Excellency began by asking me if he could speak out franklv aud i assured him that, such frankness would not be taken amiss. 1 hou^h the fehaikh in the course of this conversation stated little that was new, amfmuch that ^as ancient, history he did endeavour by recapitulating the events of the past years to place his position, ditfieultips and grievances against J3in Sand before me m their proper perspective, and at the risk of taxing Your Lord ship s patience I would venture to recapitulate briefly what he said as it brings out clearly the grave difficulties under which the Ruler of Kuwait has laboured for the past 7 or 8 years, and which would seem to be deserving of sympathetic consideration on tne part of His Majesty's Government \he story which follows was simply told: Shaikh Ahmad/though not a strong man, is, i should say, a straight forward one, and many of the facts stated ^ eic corroborated by Colonel Dickson. They represent however of course the Koweit point of view. 3. Shaikh Ahmad began by recalling that 20 years ago Bin Sand was a refugee m Kuwait and that he and Bin Sand played as children together The great Mubarak then ruled in Kuwait and it was with his aid and 'that of the Koweit tribes of Ajman and Mutair that Bin Saud was enabled to take possession of Nejd. 4 In the first instance Bin Saud sallied forth with only a few followers at i'* i * 01 ^ unes a o ains t^i n Rashid, but could make no progress, so S iaikh Mubarak sent out the Mutair and Ajman to assist him. A battle took place at Sanf and resulted in the defeat of Bin Saud and the Kuwait forces who suffered some 700 casualties and i members of the Shaikh's family lost' their d 'i' ■ j Sl ; b .f ( l uent ] , y. however, dissensions appear to have arisen amoiis Bin Rashid s tribes and taking advantage of these Bin Saud was enabled to takepossession of Nejd, but his position was weak and he appealed to Mubarak for assistance against his rival Bin Rashid. The Mulair however refused to march and Mubarak attacked them in person with the Ajman, inflicted a salutary lesson upon them and ordered them back to Jahra. Having regained control Mubarak ordered both the Ajman and the Mutair to march to Bin Baud's aid and a battle occurred at Jarab between Bin Saud's forces and those of Bin Rashid. At this battle the Ajman and Bin Saud's ' Hatari' forces were on the left and the Mutair on the right. Bin Saud's left wing was broken owing, according to Bin Sand, to treachery on the part of the Ajman, but thg situation was saved to some extent by the Mutair on the right. On the whole however the honours were with Bin Bashid and Bin Saud was compelled to retire to Nejd. It was at this battle that Captain Shakespare was killed. 5. The Ajman in company with some of Bin Saud's other tribes then went off to Central Hasa and Bin Saud again appealed to Mubarak for assistance. As usual Mubarak responded, and sent the Mutair under his own sons to attack them, sending word at the same time to Bin Saud to join forces with them. The Utter, however uhile the Kuwait forces were waiting for him, marched to the South of the Ajman and offered them peace under the most binding oath, the oath of God. They accepted, but directly they had done so Bin Saud attacked them in the night: he was however utterly defeated : his brother was killed, he himself was hit in -the leg, and compelled to flee to Hoffuf. It was some days bofore the Kuwait forces heard what had happened : when they did so they retired to Kuwait, where a family council was held. Mubarak was so disgusted at Bin Saud's act of perfidy that he was for leaving him to his fate : Jabir and Salim however were for continuing to help him and finally a small force of 400 horsemen under Jabir and Ahmad, the present Shaikh, were despatched to Hoffuf. There they found Bin Saud besieged in two small forts, the town itself being in the hands of the Ajman. The small Kuwait force could obviously not overcome the Ajman but for 70 days they carried on a guerilla warfare against them, being joined, but only just towards the end, by the Beni Hajir, one of Bin Saud's tribes, while Bin Saud himself lay inactive and made no sorties. The Kuwait forces however inflicted numerous casualties on the Ajman, and the latter, wearied of the game, finally withdrew to Ritha near Jubail. Bin Saud and the Kuwait forces followed them up and were preparing to attack when orders were received from Mubarak to cease operations as the Ajman had tendered their submission to him ; peace was concluded and Mubarak ordered the Ajman back to Safwan, while Bin Saud returned to Nejd, Jabir and Ahmad to Kuwait. While en route for Kuwait news was received of Mubarak's death, and Jabir reigned in his stead. 6. It was now that Bin Saud began to prrach the extreme tenets of Wahabism, and the Akhwan movement really started, and Dawish announced his intention of joining it and went off with the Mutair. Jabir however only reigned for one year and died of plague : no particular incident occurred between Kuwait and Nejd during this period. 7. Jabir was succeeded by Salim : that much of the present friction between Kuwait and Nejd dates from this period cannot be denied. Salim was stupid and obstinate and would listen to no advice. The Ajman and the Awazim soon after followed the Mutair. The defection of his tribes was a sore point with Salim and he showed little tact in his dealings with the growing power of Nejd while Bin Saud claimed to rule up to the walls of Kuwait. Two battles occurred : one at Hamuth in Hasa, where Salim was defeated by Dawish himself, and another at Jahra, where Salim beat off Dawish's attack. Finally it was arranged that Shaikh Ahmad should proceed on a mission to Nejd with a view to effecting a settlement of outstanding matters. While en route news was received of Salim's death. Shaikh Ahmad was welcomed with open arms by Bin Saud, who congratulated him on his accession, and it was finally agreed that there should be perpetual peace between Kuwait and Nejd, no boundaries, and complete freedom of intercourse, and the news was proclaimed by beat of drum in the cities of Kuwait and Nejd.14 8. For some months all went well, trade flourished and tribes were at peace. Bin Sand proceeded to attack Hail and Shaikh Ahmad rendered him every assistance possible, sending him Rs. 1,60,000 in cash and 3,000 camel loads of supplies, and finally Bin Saud was victorious and his power firmlv established. 9. Soon after this Bin Saud wrote to Shaikh Ahmad and said that he was in.need of funds and raised the question of custom duties, and demanded that a fixed sum should be paid to him annually by Kuwait. As in Arab eyes this would have been regarded as a tribute Shaikh Ahmad refused to pay a fixed sum, but recalled the assistance he had rendered Bin Saud in the past, and renewed his assurances that if Bin Saud was at any time in difficulties he would again assist him by any means in his power. Bin Saud then demanded that he should have his own officials in the Kuwait customs house, but for similar reasons Shaikh Ahmad refused to agree, and t ere is no doubt that had he agreed he would have lost his position as an independent ruler in tbe eyes of his own people. 10. It was then, 7 years ago, that Bin Saud declared a blockade against Kuwait, and for 7 years this small Sta^e has been subject to constant raids, its trade has bepn in great measure destroyed, and its economic life seriou ^lv inter fered with. Its customs revenue, which was formerly about 8 lakhs 'a vear, has fallen to about 1| lakhs. Trade is stagnant, and Mere it not for the pearl industry Kuwait town would have been reduced to a village and most of the population compelled to seek their living elsewhere. The list of these raids was forwarded with Colonel Barrett's despatch No. 40, dated 8th August (F. No. 75-N./29). 11. During this period came the Ojair conference and the grievances of Kuwait at tbe results are known. Kuwait territories were reduced in extent and the chief grazing grounds of the Mutair and Ajman transferred to Bin Saud, thus finally severing their connection with Kuwait and leaving this small principality defenceless. Shaikh Ahmed recalled to me how on Sir Percy Cox's return he said to him ' Then it is still the sword that wins the a ay in Arabia '. 12 Finally a year ago came the revolt of the Mutair and Ajman against Bin Saud. While the storm was brewing the Shaikh received a letter'from Bin Saud asking for his assistance and co-operation, but not unnaturally this was not forthcoming. It may not be wdthout interest to recall briefly the origin of the present revolt, as recounted by Faisal&gt;l Dawish to Colonel Dickson some time ago. lie stated that when Bin Saud started his religious crusade they were inflamed with the idea that the days of the Prophet had returned ; that Bin Saud was a new Imam and under his leadership Islam w r as to be purified, and extended and a ' jehad ' was preachert not merely against infidels but against such dissenters as Sunnis and Shiahs, who 'were to be destroved or forced to conform to Wahabi tenets. When the expansion of the Bin Sand's power was checked he was compelled to check his Akhwan and to renounce his ' jehad ' and the ' Imam ' legend was broken. The Mutair and Ajman leaders demanded that the matter should be referred to the Ulema, anda' conference w^as called. Dawish and Ibn Hithlain at first refused to go to Bin Saud's tents although he offered them safety on oath but they said they would meet him at the Ulema's tent Dawdsh however subsequently agreed 'to meet Bin Saud but on arrival he was shot through the stomach and his body given to his women to romove : Ibn Hithlain made good his escape, ancTas is known, Dawish subsequently recovered. 14. To return to Kuwait, directly the revolt occurred the raids ceased, trade increased, shepherds and others were enabled to wander far afield un molested, and ships began to bring much larger consignments than formerlv for Kuwait. For four months, after seven years, Kuwait enjoyed prosperity. Then came the fiat of His Majesty's Government that all supplies were to be denied to the Akhwan, and the Shaikh, who had been blockaded by Nejd for 7 years was ordered in his turn to close his frontiers and to abandon the old Kuwait tribes who were ready to return to their former allegiance.15 15. I think it can be said that Shaikh Ahmad has genuinely tried with all the means at his disposal to carry out the wishes of His Maiesty's Govern- ment. He realises that he is between two powerful neighbours, that deprived of the only two Kuwait^ tribes that count he is defenceless and that his only hope of maintaining his independence is to relv on the British Government. That the Akhwan have on occasion camped in Kuwait territory and used Kuwait wells is undeniable, but that the Shaikh has co operated loyally with the Political Agent in having them turned out as rapidlv as possible with the means at his disposal is equally undeniable. It must be borne in mind that the Kuwait boundary is indistinguishable on the »round to tribesmen, and is a purely artificial one defined by no landmarks : it is doubt ful if many Europeans would confidently say exactly where it runs. The Shaikh has no forces at his disposal who are capable of turning out the Mutair or the Ajman : the only method he can employ is persuasion. On the other hand the fact that the Kuwait customs statistics show no improvement is proof that he has denied them supplies. 16. His Excellency stated that he had recapitulated these past events to show the relationship subsisting between him and Bin Saud and the difficulty of effecting a settlement. To the support of Mubarak and Kuwait forces did Bin Saud largely owe his original successes : at Hoffuf his life had been saved by Jabir and Ahmad with Kuwait forces When Shaikh Ahmad visited him he had promised perpetual peace with Kuwait, and at Hail the Shaikh of Kuwait had afforded him every assistance in his power. Despite all this Bin Saud would not abandon bis ambition to rule up to the walls of Kuwait. It ^as only against Kuwait that it was proposed to impose these customs posts' • there was no talk of customs posts on the Iraq frontiers though in normal times many caravans left Zobeir for Nejd, neither had Bin Saud claimed customs duty on goods imported through the Trucial Coast ports or Oman. * He, Shaikh Ahmad, was ready to agree to any reasonable arrangement com patible with the maintenance of his own position as and independent ruler, but lie was convinced that Bin Saud would agree to nothing unless His Majesty's Government informed him in the plainest terms that they would not tolerate aggression into Kuwait territory. 17. His Excellency stated that for 7 years he had reported every instance ^ aggression to the 1 olitical Agent, but as far as he was aware no representa tions had been made on his behalf, and in no instance had any compensation or redress been obtained. He added that as long as the rebels were in the fiel 1 he had no fear of Bin Saud : he did not seem to think it probable that Bin Saud would beat them in the open field, but he did think that within a short period terms of peace would probably be arranged. Dawish himself has stated that he was sure that he would then be ordered to raid into Kuwait territory but that to this he will never agree. And Shaikh Ahmad is convinced that as soon as Bin Saud has come to terms with the Mutair and Ajman he will renew the blockade of Kuwait and the raids into Kuwait territory. He was most grateful for the assurances that he had received that in the event of his co-operating loyally with the British authorities His Majesty's Governmen would endeavour to effect an honourable settlement with Bin Saud; he thought however that past history showed that there was little prospect of Bin Saud agreeing to any reasonable arrangement, and that on one pretext or another he would reject all proposals put before him, except under the strongest pressure. He hoped however that, if his forebodings came true, His Majesty's Government would, in view of his defenceless condition, take such measures as might be possible to protect not merely the towm but also the territories of his principality and the property of his subjects, and also to obtain redress for the past. 18. I would emphasise that Shaikh Ahmad spoke in no carpin 0 ' or complaining spirit: he is certainly an attractive personality, an Arab of the desert rather than of the Gulf type, and as he himself stated several times has spent most of his life among the Bedouin. He realises fully that sinc&lt; the defection of the Mutair and Ajman he owes his existence as an independenf ruler entirely to the British Government. I promised him however that i16 (19) would report what he had told me and I have therefore repeated the conversa tion at length since it would seem desirable that when endeavours are made to effect a settlement His Majesty's Government should be in possession of his past relations with Bin Saud so that they may appreciate the difficulties that will have to be overcome. It would not seem to be a question of arriving at working arrangements regarding customs duties or similar matters (these present little difficulty given some measure of good will on both sides) but, au fond, one of curbing the ambitions of a powerful ruler.

(11)] stated that the King wished to raise in connection with Persian Gulf affairs. 2. T have now had an interview with Sheikh Fuad Hamza in which I brought the subject up. 3. 1 stated that although T knew that His Majesty's Government had been in communication with the British Authorities in the Persian Gulf in order to obtain complete information on the subjects raised I found it difficult myself to understand exactly what action was expected from His Majesty's Govern ment. 4. Sheikh Fuad replied that in the first instance he had asked the Acting British Agent to communicate to His Majesty's Government a request that a delegation should be sent to negotiate a settlement of various matters connected with the Persian Gulf, or alternatively that authority should be given to the British Agency to negotiate. The subjects for negotiation were various but were covered by the headings which he had mentioned. e *P h } [ ™] ^at there had evidently been some misunderstanding and that His Majesty's Government were not under the impression, so far as I conld judge hom the correspondence, that the Hejaz Government had definitely wished to open formal negotiations on the subject. His note of June 12tii J Enclosure 1 to Serial Xo. (11)] made no mention of this. T added that I would inform His Majesty's Government of what he had told me but that it would 1 thought, save time and facilitate matters if he could give me a memorandum ex plaining m detail the exact points which His Majesty had in mind, and if he could give an indication of His Majesty's views on them. He agreed to do this. 6 At his request I followed up my verbal suggestion with a letter of which 1 enclose a copy. 7.

Sheikh Fuad is evidently averse from being drawn into a discussion at the present' stage. Both from the conversation which I had with him and from his letter now received I conclude that he is either reluctant to move in this matter without instructions from the King, or else he is afraid lest by enterjuo- into greater deail beforehand he may prejudice his request for normal negolia' tions. 4.

I Bhall be ftolng primarily to discuss Kuwait questions but he has also said that there are various matters connected vrith the Persian Gulf which he wishes to raise and they will pre sumably be the three questions mentioned in Jeddah ^ I') despatch No. 150, dated the 19th June 1929, of which a copy was sent to you. ^he three points are thereir only mentioned vaguely mid His Majesty's Govemment arc asking him to let them know much more specifiically what he wants to discuss. in view however of the slowness of communication with Bahrain and the fact that 1 shall probably be asked for my views shortly 1 am writing now to you on the subject. The first question is that of customs and | transit dues col-iected at Bahrain on gooas destined for iiejd. I do not think that Bahrain could be asked to make greater concessions than it lias already done, but Bin Baud is, I believe, going to raise the question of goods imported for his personal use, to which Captain C. 0. Prior, I.A., Political Agent, BAHTUIN.I ■ ■ i- 2 - which expresBlon he will probably give a uomewhat wide oenoe. Ao you know certain Huling j^nnceo in India are allowed cuatoraa exemption on goods imported t for their personal use and possibly some similar con cession might be made to Mn Kaud provided we could tie him down to certain specific articles, e.g. motor cars, sporting rifles, etc., and exclude such things as rice, sugar, and so on. ihis will probably be difficult to do and I imagine in practice articles of that kind are imported by Bin Saud through uecca and not through Bahrain. Please let me know your views on this question generally and also what you estimate the present concession costs the 15ahrain State annually Should I be right in saying that the present 2 per cent customs duties really only cover the clerical and other expenses involved in the transit? The two other points, viz. passports for Hejdis and position of his agents are inter-related. Presumably this is qusaibi's handiwork, anci an attempt on his part to get some sort of official position for himself. The latter point wc can, I think, veto without difficulty, on the ground that it wouxd lead to similar requests from Iraq and Persia. as regards the former, is the passport system fSr ttejdis working satisfactorily, and lias Win ^aud got any ifeitinate grievance of any kind ? tv jliiu . r % sI Confident! No. 31 C. The Agency, Bahrain. 28th l arch 1^30. -v Please refer to your* letuer No. 33 S, dated the 25tl of February 193 0. I have sent the actual figures in a report which I made last year, but it may be safely assumed that the R.E. concession costs the Bahrain Government a lakh a ye;, r. I en- u tirely agree v/ith your view thatthey cannot reasonably ,ex- increase pected to sxiKxd it, • nd the original concession, as you are aw'\re was forced upon ShaiKh Isa after a considerable amount of pressure. The 2 /' due more than covers thp clerical and other f=''penses, but not by very much. I think 1,0 would actually cover the out of pocket expenses, but as you xzjs know the Government of India charge an R.E- duty that amounts to more than 3&gt;o, for they only grant a rebate of 7/8ths duty on a tariff that it is often as much as 25^. I dont think even then that orts like Bombay and Karachi are a fair standard. Host of the R#S- work is carried out by small ship ments in dhows, and provides far more work that a similar transaction in India. 4. I think it would be most unfair if we allowdd Bin Saud to force another concession out of Bahrain, and I feel sure that when Shaikh Hamad realised that any further concession would involve a cut in the Civil List he would not give way, terrified of Bin Saud though he is. I dont• fe^l that it is possible to give any concession to personal as opposed to private imports. India again is not A parallel. In India, the Central Government is taking a full customs due from the whole State and can well afford to throwgx its ruler a sop or two. Here we only get 2/0 and it is Bin Saud who charges the 25/0 to his own people. Kashmir is the only—i Pag e 2. Indian State that can be taken as a fair analogy, and I am sure that the Government of India would never give up the l/Sth duty they retain from Kashmir imports. 5. I discussed the point with Sir Francis Humphreys in 'Baghdad and he told me that they allowed the Afghan Royal family the concession of free imports, and that they promptly proceeded tib imports all the State requirements as their personal property ! Bin Saud obtained a permit for 40,000 bags of rice at a special weight ' a lighter bag so that mc.y be generous cheaply ) and this shows whut he considers 1 person 1 imports.* Almost everything thut Qusaibis import is in his name, anr' unless a limited number of cars, 3iy two a year, were specified, ^usaibis would bring in all their stuff saying it was their masters, and we would be unable to prove it was not. They have a curious system by which the King's agents only take it over at Q.'.tif, but all passes in his name notwitgstanding. 6. The Bahrain Government will be prepared to ma.Ke no Ci .arge on arms or ammunition, and in fact have collected none so far. The import of arms is actually forbidden, so i th-^y ave no rate fixed for it. This is a concession that might be made, and it could be extended to cover bombs and all similar letlaal weapons. I would have added aeroplane parts, but it would be very hard to say if canvas or wood ' was going to repair an aeroplane or not, and anything ambi guous is better left out. Jiddah 7. ^To, 3 crkk : x is not always used, and he imports a great many cars through Bahrain. A dozen have just gone through to him. If cars were included in the concession a very small number would h ve to unspecified, as he im ports quantiti&amp;s of Chevrolet trucks, and if we allowed him two or three a year it would be as many as King George nromally buys. * 8. As regrds passports, as I pointed out last year, a Mejdi can obtain a passport by going 5 hours in a% 3. 11 launch to a distance of 40 miles, whereas in India many people have to go several days Journey. No, he has not a leg* to stand on here, and I have never heard the shadow of • grouse about it, and I endorse hundreds of Uejdi papers every year for India and Iraq. Of course the ^usaibis will never be satisfied till they get themselves mad' consuls, but if we said that we should want to put a consul in Hofuf as a quid praquo we should hear no more about it. 9. ''hen I said in para 6 that they would make no charge on arms, ^in Saud would have to pay the handling o' pier lees charges that we all have to pay. Even I who po.y no customs have to pay this, am; it amounts roughly to an average of an a rational l\/ 0 ad valorem. In Karachi it is slightly more. I hope I have made myself clear. ; kto.

I understand that the India Office share this view. As regards the third paragraph of your letter, it was agreed at an inter departmental meeting held here yesterday, which Hall and Laithwaite attended, that the India Office should prepare for your concurrence and ours a draft tele gram to the Government of India inviting their views on a proposal that a meeting, such as that suggested in our telegram to Jedda referred to above, should be arranged, to take place after the pilgrimage, between Ibn Sand and the Political Resident. Such a meeting could, the India Office suggest, also be attended by the Sheikh of Koweit, and could deal not only with Persian Gulf questions but with Nejd-Koweit relations generally. I am inclined to think that this might afford a good solution of both problems, and that it would be far better than attempting to deal with either by correspondence ; but it will be time enough, I think to consider the question in greater detail when we receive the India Office draft.

Secondly regarding suggestion that Bin Saud, Sheikh of Koweit and I should meet I agree there is little chance of anything resulting unless I am armed with a bargaining weapon. It is abundantly dear I fear nothing less than threatening him with strong action in some direction in which he is sensitive will ever bring Bin Saud to see reason where Koweit is concerned.

It is observed from the Viceroy's telegram of the 19th of May [Serial No. (39)], a copy of which accompanied your letter under reference/that the (rovernment of India have agreed generally with the views expressed by the Resident in his despatch No. 20 of the 30th of April [Enclosure of Serial No. (38)]. Lord Passfield, for his part, shares those views. 3. Of the measures put forward by the Resident in paragraphs 11-14 of his above-mentioned despatch, the only one which calls for immediate action by His Majesty's Government is that of raising with Ibn Saud the question of the blockade on Koweit. There is, however, the further question whether an endeavour should be made to induce Ibn Saud to agree to the return of Awazim ti ibes to the suzerainty of the Shaikh of Koweit. This latter question was raised ^ in the letter from this Department No. 69155129 of the 4th of October 1929 [Serial No. (1) in File No. 375-N.I29], and the Secretary of State for India has a^ieed that there would be advantage in making such an attempt {vide para graph 4 of your letter No. P.-8146|29 of the 1st of January last [Serial No. (10) [hid]. Owing, however, to the uncertainty created by the recent operations bv Ib\n Saud against his rebel tribes, the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on this suggestion have, it is understood not yet been formulat ed. v 4. It is considered that these questions might in the first instance be dis cussed orally between representatives of the Departments concerned, and it is suggested that a meeting might take place at the Colonial Office on Wednesdav the 28th of May at 3-30 p. m . I am to enquire whether Mr. Benn concurs in this' proposal, and if so, to request that a representative of the India Office may be nominated to attend.

It is learnt independently from an anthoritative tlion^h private sonrce in Mecca that the King's attitude is in fact dne to displeasure over discouraging reply to his proposal to make visit in question. He takes the line that the nature of the welcome accorded him when he actually did land at Bahrein proves that the reason given for what he interpreted as deliberate refusal was merely an excuse. Unless you consider it important that personal relations between the King and the Residency should be re-established at an early date, I doubt greatly whether any useful purpose would be served by further pursuing the matter at present.

I had entertained great hopes when I wrote paragraph 15 (d) of my Diary 1st to 15th February that relations were going to improve all round with Bin Saud. The Shaikh thought so too. 2* So far we have been sadly disappointed where the question of the blockade is concerned, though without doubt official relations such as the writing of polite letters etc. etc. are on a better footing than they have been for some years; and certainly we have been free during the last 12 months from raids into Kuwait organized by Bin Saud, and have not seen any bodies of his armed retainers (sarriya) enter Kuwait, and treat the people as if they were Nejd subjects in the way they used to do in Colonel More * s time. 3• whether this is due to better management on our part or a desire to improve outward relations on the part of Bin Saud is open to question. ^ The all important question of the blockade however has remained much as it was before. The only dif ference being that whereas in the past a regular and active siege of Kuwait was maintained almost up to the walls of Kuwait, now the strangle hold has receded to a point across the border, but though apparently more peaceful on the surface, it nevertheless is just as tight. 5. The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. X- } tyvii - //• 7' 2oTo be more precice, the situation today is that (a) No merchant caravans from any of the towns of Qusim, Jebel, Shammar or Najd generally are allowed to come down to Kuwait at all . (b) No tribal caravans ( i.e. of tribes across the border) desiring to replenish their supplies (musabilah) are permitted to visit Kuwait. (c) No caravans from Kuwait are allowed to cross the border into Nejd territory. Of the three,caravans under (a) and(C) which of course are the ones that count, have entirely ceased to ply but under (b) there is a slight trickle. This trade of course done secretly and bedouins coming in do it in groups of 5 to 10 camels at a time, and run great risks in so doing. 7. Ibrahim ibn Arfaj superintends the blockade from Hafar, and in all three cases where caravans are caught, there is wholesale confiscation of camels and mer chandize as well as other heavy penalties. 8. I am told on the authority of the Kuwait Director of Customs that Bin Saud before proceeding to the Haj ordered large notices to be posted in all the mosques of Nejd and Hassa forbidding his subjects to trade with so Kuwait under any pretext whal/ever and under the threat of most severe penalties. Also that all persons abetting in such trade would be most severely dealt with, and lastly any Governor or official in whose area such abetment had taken place would be dismissed. Though I cannot prove the above, I believe the story to be correct. Certainly results look as if the report were true for today trade with interior towns, may be said to be as dead as the proverbial 'Dodo'. 9. During the time I have been in Kuwait, not a single caravan has gone out from Kuwait to any Nejd towns, nor has a single one come in. — —/I 21 (59) {Received on 22nd June 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 23, dated the 5th June 1930.)

L —ED 2* ^ ixu • [0% - ■^1 My dear Laithwaite, I enclose a copy of a telegram from Ryan at Jedda about the proposed negotiations with Ibn Baud on Koweit -Nejd relations and Persian Gulf questions. The letter of 29th l£iy which he mentions merely sent Ryan, for his information,a copy of the Government of India's telegram No. 36 72-S of December 17, (see your letter P. 8146 /29 of December 19 last), together with an explanation that, in view of the suggestion in paragraph 5 of the Bushire Despatch No, 21 of April 30, 'which was still under consideration', it seemed desirable to make sure that the Jedda files on Uejd-Koweit questions should be complete. Uo doubt you will agree that the best plan will be 1 to discuss this telegram from Ryan together with the other material we shall have before us, at the interdepartmental meeting proposed in the Colonial Office letter Uo, 77003/30 of I'ay 26, if and when that meeting eventually takes place. Meanwhile, from this telegram Ryan appears not yet to have understood the position with regard to these questions, and we propose, subject to India Office concurrence, to write to him privately, if possible by bag leaving on Thursday, June 26, {although as time is so short we are prepared to wait until that of July 3), on the following lines. I would begin by explaining that the settlement of the Koweit-Nejd customs question is a matter of some urgency, since we promised the Sheikh of Koweit at the end of last year to help him to reach a satisfactory agreement with Ibn Baud on this matter, if he (the Sheikh of Koweit), played up properly as regards the l.ejd rebellion. On the strength of that promise, the Sheikh did on the whole play up pretty difficult well and it is therefore^for us to defer indefinitely intervening with Ibn Saud on his behalf in a matter which is of considerable importance to the economic life of Koweit. ' On . .On the other hand, the position as regards Persian Gulf question is quite different. It was Ibn Saud himself who took the initiative in asking for a discussion of this question, and for a variety of reasons we are not anxious to embark on a discussion of some of the points involved unless this is inevitable, For instance, if there is to be any general discussion of Persian Gull questions -^bn baud is sure to raise the question of Ifejdi representation at Bahrein. Were we to be obliged to agree to the establishment of some kind of Nejdi representative at Bahrein our position might be rendered very difficult vis-a-vis the Persians, whose clair for representation in Bahrein we have steadily resisted. There are other points also where a settlement with Ibn oaud of Persian Gulf questions might lead to awkward reactions on our negotiations with Persia, and we should therefore have no reason to regret thefoostponement of a general discussion with Ibn Saud until our Persian negotiations are considerably further advanced. We add' that the whole question of our relations with Ibn Saud in the Persian Gulx&gt; and in connexion with Kejd-Koweit relations, is shortly coming up for inter departmental discussion, and that Ryan will be informed of the results of that discussion in due course. I am sending a copy of this letter to James at the Colonial Office, who, I understand, is now dealing with the question. Yours ever, Sd/- George Rendel* Laithwaite, Esq.{S 3333/96/91) / ^3 Decypher.

Mr. 7/arner wrote on Kay 29th that suggestion in para graph 5 of Bushire Despatch No. 21 of April 30th 1930 was still under consideration. I have not mastered Persian Gulf questions sufficiently to express official opinion but it seems to me that any action taken on Customs policy on Koweit frontier would do little.to elucidate it and nothing to over come the difficulty. Although the King has refused to discuss Persian Gulf matters with Biscoe it seems to 'be in the interests of all parties that they should be discussed with someone if it can be done without encountering insoluble problems of frontier and tribal control. Is it not worth considering the means of agreeing on programme of matters affecting Koweit 4nd Bahrein to form subject of a formal negotiation between the representatives ? Biscoe would be obviously the best person to conduct it if the King ! s present objection could be over come. Alternatively it might be conducted in Jedda in I December or January by me assisted by one or two Persian Gulf experts. Interval could be devoted to preparing the ground with Ibn Saud who himself asked for such a negotiation, pre- paration of programme and, if necessary&gt; consultation between His Kajesty's Government and myself during the autumn. I put this up now though very tentatively so that if suggested procedure should seem feasible I might seize any opportunity that may offer of sounding His Llajesty.* v/i th 1 s. c ■Hi C0IOTD3OTIAL. 1^1 1 (u/) % TTo • F,l72-N/29 * A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to to the HorJble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in continuation of the endorsement from the Government of India in the i^orfeign and Political Depart ment, No. F. 172-11/29, dated the 15th July 19 50. 2.

From your tele gram No.59 it appears that Ihn Saud's objection to negoti ations with Colonel Biscoe arises from Bahrain incident. His Majesty's Grovernment hope that this objection may be overcome by Colonel Biscoe*s explanation given in his telegram No.678 of July 4th enclosed in my despatch No. 247 of July 21st,on receipt of which you should approach Ibn Saud on following lines. His Majesty's G-overnment are now in a position to discuss proposed agreement between Nejd andkuwait and are anxious to take an oppor tunity also to discuss Kuwait customs embargo regardingregarding whicti representations have already 'been made to His Majesty. They trust that for this purpose he will 'be prepared to agree to a meeting with Political Resident in the neighhourhood of the Persian Oulf.

If he says objection is of a different character and it proves impossible to remove it with information at your disposal you should state that you must refer position for instructions. disassociate this negotiation from Ihn Saud's desiderata in Persian Gulf.

He added nothing to my knowledge, except statement that he ( gr.mu^O King to have communicated direct with Biscoe aljout the proposed visit and received no answer; 'but his account shows that His l/fegesty's resentmenu far greater and more deep-seated than I had realised.

On 'both occasions I scouted possibility oj . aiacuur!^ using every argument I could deduce from correspondence up to date. I stressed the importance from every poin^ ol view of good relations 'between Biscoe and ITsn Saud. Fuad finally agreed, 'but admitted frankly,, that owing to Royal attitude he could only inform me personally of position, and must leave it to me to consider possibility of promoting re conciliation by some independent action. 2. T 'ing is overtired and is by way of deputing much of his authority.

I entirely agree that Biscoe is ^-est person to negotiate, 'but Hedjaz Government are incriminating folly, suggest now that they have an accredited l-inister here all diplomatic 'business should norinally 'be dealt with through the i ^jation. They could not of course rex'use special missio , 'but they are in principle averse to discussing questions direct with neighbouring British Authorities as such. Tact that those authorities are not directly under Foreign OiVice increases this tendency. 4„ I think it certain that any attempt to obtain formal settlement of Kuwait customs question will entail re- opening hy other side^other Persian Gulf questions especially as xas-c action hy us v/as that described in your telegram ^o.42. ^ ' 9 ^ • In view of the ahove I feel that procedure laid down in yout telegram will not advance matters either as regards settlement of Kuwait questions or liquidate personal incident wiiich, owing to King's extreme and un reasoning susceptibility, is graver than we knew.

' • you raised in your telegram ITo. 87 of June 2lst on this subject are then fully considered# Meanwhile it may be useful to you, for your personal and confidential information, to have the following indications of our attitude and general policy. In the first place I should perhaps explain that we should like to reach an early decision in the Koweit-Nejd customs question quite apart from the other questions involved. As you may have seen from the old correspondence, ve promised the Sheikh of Koweit, at the end of last year, to help him to reach a satisfactory agreement with Ibn Saud on this matter if he(the Sheikh of Koweit) played up properly as regards the ITejd rebellion. We are inclined to take the view that, largely on the strength of that promise, the Sheikh did, on the whole, play up pretty well; and it is therefore difficult for us to defer indefinitely intervening with Ibn Saud on his behalf in a matter which is of considerable importance to the economic life of Koweit. On the other hand, the position as regards Persian Gulf questions is quite different. It was Ibn Saud himself who Sir Andrew Ryan, K.B.E., t: ' •'. r ~ - ^— rc ti Jv) iw • 18 JO I i f c . t tq; J 3 i i fvS) m K-f who took the initistive in asking for a discussion of these questions, and for a variety of reasons v ;e are not anxious to emtark on a discussion of some of the points involved unless it is inevitable. I enclose, for your conficential information, a copy of an old despatch from the Political Resident at Bushire to the Government of India, dated. June 1st 1929, from which you will see that some of the questions which Ibn S&amp;ud wishes to raise are likely to prove difficult and tiresome. Por instance, if there is to he any general discussion of Persian Gulf questions, Ibn Stud is sure to :-aise that of Hejdi representation at Bahrein, Were v .e obliged to agree to the establishment of some kind of ITejdi representative at Bahrein, our position might be rendered very difficult vis-a-vis the Persians, whose claim for representation in Bahrein we have steadily resisted. There are other points also where a settlement with Ibn Saud of Persian Gulf questions might lead to awkward reactions on our negotiations with Persia, and we should therefore have no reason to regret the postponement of a general discussion with Ibn S^-ud until our Persian negotiation^ are considerably further advanced. I hope that the above explanation will help to clarify what is, I am afraid, one of your most complicated problems. We will let you know the result of our interdepartmental discussion in due course. The questions involved, however, must inevitably take some time to settle, more especially as frequent consultation with Indie is necessary and it is difficult to deal with the matter otherwise than by despatch* Sd.

I made the matter the spear point of my first great onslaught, and I had to take that risk if I was to impress him with the importance of representations a newly arrivea Minister. I have 'been very careful to try and keep a alance, as it is most important not to antagonize him. 1 have Just drafted a long telegrai. to the Foreign Office ahout the Bahrain incident and Kuwait settlements. I have not previously mentioned the former direct to you as I did not know how you stood as regards what is a grievance, however unreasonable, against y l i personally. Your letter of June 23 was useful to me as I was able to tell Fuad privately and in general terms | that you had been wondering why the King would not meet I you and had not even thought, at the date of writing, of the Bahrain episode as a possible cause of displeasure. 1 hope you will realise, apart from any question or who should negotiate - and you are the most qualified person in this case, if it can oe arranged - I . have dene my utmost in my conversations with Fuad to pave the way for an appeasement of Ibn oa'ud's feeling. x x^ vaw ai. v jk, fW.

Your Majesty, After Compliments. A sudden illness which fell upon me some days before I left Jedda prevented me from sending any farewell messages in person. Had this not happened, I would have wished once more to thank Your Majesty for the many proofs of Kindness You gave me during the first stage of my mission in Your country and for the beautiful gifts v/hich You were pleased to bestow on my family and myself to marii the auspicious occasion of my appointment as first British Minister at Your Court. I hope to discharge this duty at the earliest opportunity after my return. I am now, thaniC God, almost completely restored to health. The same reason prevented me from addressing Your Majesty on a very important question before I left. I recently learnt from the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, to my great regret, that the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had incurred Your Majesty*s displeasure over the matter of Your visit to Bahrein in February. I had already heard something of this from other sources but my information was of such a nature and so incomplete that I could not broach the subject to Your Majesty.I (g) |-)0 I am nov/ in possession of all the facts, which are as follows When Your Majesty was returning from the Lupin Conference, You intimated to the captain of the Patrick Stev^art Your wish to visit Bahrein. That officer, as in duty bound, reported this to Colonel Biscoe. It is deeply rooted in our traditions that Royal visits to adjoining states are matters involving many delicate considerations and requiring careful preparation. One of the many reasons for this is that it is essential ttu.t nothing should happen to compromise the dignity or convenience of the Royal visitor himself. Colonel Biscoe had no information except a wireless message from the captain of the Patrick Stewart. He was entirely unaware that Your Majesty had already communicated Your intentions to the Sheikh of Bahrein. This is a most important point, as knowledge of that fact would have entirely altered his views and attitude. As it was, he followed the tradition of which I have spoken and expressed the view through the captain of the Patrick Stewart that a visit for which he understood no preparation to have been made might be attended by certain inconveniences. The best proof that the Political Resident was not merely raising unnecessary objections is that, when Your Majesty did in fact visit Bahrein in accordance with the intention which You had intimated to the Sheikh, Colonel Biscoe, having in the meantime received full information, in no way disapproved of the action of the captain of the Patrick Stewart in conducting You thither.I could mention several considerations to show how completely correct towards Your Majesty- were Colonel Biscoe^ intentions and attitade. I will confine myself to two. It is difficult to conceive any circumstances in which a highly placed British representative would put a slight upon the Sovereign of an independent and friendly State. It is quite impossible to conceive Colonel Biscoe T s doing so at a time when Your Majesty was still the guest of the British Government and was returning from a Conference held with the happiest results under their auspices. Secondly, Colonel Biscoe had occasion on June 23rd to write me a purely private letter intended for my eye only. He knew at that time that Your Majesty had refused to receive him. He had no inkling of the reason. In his letter to me, he sought in vain for anything in his past relations with Your Majesty which could explain Your displeasure. He did not even think of the Bahrein affair. This shows that his conscience was entirely clear on that subject. Your Majesty once described to me, with humour but wath a serious intention, the qualities of the chieftains of Arabia. You have made Yourself eminent over all of them by superior qualities, including a strong sense of justice. I submit the above account of the Bahrein affair to that sense of justice and I ask Your Majesty to recognise, as a man of large and generous mind can do more easily than another that Your displeasure with Colonel Biscoe hashas been founded on a complete misunderstanding. I should not achieve my object, if Your Majesty, out of consideration for my Government or myself, were to accept the explanation, yet retain a feeling that Colonel Biscoe had treated You incorrectly and discourteously. If I cannot convince Your Majesty of the contrary, I should consider it a greater proof of friendship that You S 'hould tell me so candidly. My object is to restore Colonel Biscoe to that position in Your Majesty's esteem which he held last January. This is important for two reasons. In the first place it is a matter of deep concern to me, as the representative of my Sovereign for the whole of Your Majesty's dominions, that the best feeling should prevail between Your Majesty 's Government and the responsible British authorities in the surrounding States with which my Government have special relations. Nothing can do irore than this to maintain those excellent general relations between our countries which it is my first duty to promote and consolidate. In the second place my Government feel that, although they have created a British Legation at Jedda, there are certain questions of which a British Minister in that place cannot have sufficient knowledge to deal with them in all their details. i?his applies more particularly to questions arising on the other side of Arabia. At the present time my Government are moGt anxious to proceed with two ofof these questions, numely (1) the conclusion with Koweit of an agreement similar to the Bahra Agreement, to which Your Kajeaty has already agreed in principle and to which the Ruler of Koweit has now similarly agreed; and (2) an adjustment of the difficulties which have so long impeded the normal course of trade between Nejd and Koweit. My Government consider that no one is better qualified by knowledge and proximity to the places where the questions arise to discuss those questions than the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. They are confident that, if Your Majesty would consent to discuss them with Colonel Biscoe at a convenient opportunity when You visit Nejd, a settlement could be reached. It is increasingly the practice in Europe to employ specially qualified experts for the handling of such questions. At the same time I am myself deeply interested in the general aspects of those questions, and if I can do anything to promote a successful issue of the proposed negotiations with the Political Resident, I shall be at Your Majesty 1 s service. In any reply which Your Majesty may deign to return to this letter, I would ask you to inform me of Your views on this matter also. I pray for Your Majesty 1 s continued good health and end with my most respectful compliments.MiPrlYate &amp; PTgonaj . British neaidency. Bush ire, the 17th October - l'\ 1 ghould like to thank you rery much for the wholly admirable letter which you wrote to ibn aaua about his refusal to ra et me. It certainly could not have been more tactfully or reasonably worded and put the whole case in a nut-shell. 1 have not yet received a copy of his reply but understand privately from the India office that while His Majesty is still a little gruaging, peace has been restored. I am grateful for your efforts on my behalf. I hope you are the better for your change home. I imagine the climate of Jeddah must be very trying and worse than that of the Persian Gulf as you presumably do not get such a good winter as we get here. 1 have myself been laid up for about seven weeks with a bad leg but am just beginning to get about again. Have you an^ idea whether Ibn aaud proposes to return to hejd this cold weather, ana if so when? jay negotiations with him v if they take place # will not be easy as the only counter I have is the reduced transit duty given to riejd goods passing through Bahrain, and this would certainly have to be used very tactfully. I must say, however, that I think Ibn Saud^ conduct towards Kuwait is really unpardonable, ne was brought up in ivuwalt and played Sir Aiidrev; Ryan, British Legation, j eddah.played as a boy with the Shaifch of Kuwait# vhen he started on the career vrhich has led M m to his present exalted positlonhe v;as supported entirely by MUbaraic, tne then Shaikh of Kuwait, and the Kuwait tribes, and for many years they were his chief support in his gradual rise of power. Mow to turn round and strangle Kuwait as he nas been doing for years past is certainly the height of ingratitude* However I aa afraid that appeals on hese lines would not meet wi-ch much response.

I ao not think there is any probabality that negotiations with delegates would have any useful result. Ibn Saud, who is obviously trying to evade the Kuwait issue, woMld certainly not authorise them to make con- -cessions on question of policy of this nature, and if negotiations were abortive, as it probable, it would be more difficult to reopen the matter on a subsequent occasion. Unless Pyan sees any objection I suggest that Ibn Saud might be informed that in consonance with the known policy of His Majesty's Government of encourag- - ing friendly relations betv/een neighbouring Arab Rulers it is proposed that the Shaikh of Kuwait and Dickson should accompany me for discussionof Kuwait questions, other matters being discussed with me direct. That in these circumstances negotiations could not be con- % -ducted with delegates, whom Shaikh, as independent ruler, would not be prepared to meet. That while in normal circumstances Ojair or some other place on the coast would have been a suitable kxilh venue, in view of the shortness of His Majesty's stay in Neja His Majesty^ Government are prepared to authorise me to proceed inland to Hoffuf, Riadh or any similar place selected by King.

Hafiz Wahba^ suggestion for meeting between Biscoe and Ibn Saud was made with idea of finally closing Bahrein incident. Ryan considers that if suggestion v /ere made that Ibn Baud should meet not only Biscoe but also the tiheikh of Koweit and DicJcson he wuuld thin^c that efforts were being made to rush him into formal meeting with Resident; ( ? he would) resent this and woul&gt;| probably refuse, we should then have failed not only to get a discussion on Coweit questions, but also to close Bahrein incident. In Ryan's view it is therefore important that if Biscoe goes to see Ibn Baud while latter is in i«ejd, he should go alone, and primarily ou courteous visit, 'i'here would of course be no objection to uis broaching the Koweit questions with King more or less informally if he thought the atmosphere favourable. 3. Latest information from Hafiz wabha suggests that time factor may give rise to difficulties. Ibn Saud apparently intends to go into Hejd early in December on tour, returning to Medina by about the iddle of January. 4. Subject to your further observations, we are disposed to agree with Ryan's view that we should first aim at courteous visit by Biscoe unaccompanied to Ibn Gaud if possible w .Jile latter is in Ncjd this winter, and that for the moment we shall /.shall du best to wait to see if hafiii wahba's letter produces invitation frora Ibn Saud for visit by Kesident.

If however I go on friendly visit of courtesy then I quite agree that Sheikh should not accompany me. If visit of this nature can he arranged I consider there would he greater chance of coming to friendly understanding over Kuwait affairs than if missio was more formal. I am therefore strongly in favour of it Dickso' mentioned in letter received yesterday that small trihal caravans were arriving at Kuwait so it is evident that Bin Saud's attitude is changing somewhat so moment would seem propitious. I presume there would be no objection to-my taking Dickson in capacity of officer on my staff. He is persona grata with Bin 3aud and also moot suitable interpreter at informal discussions. Demi-Gfficial Reference Edward's demi-official letter No.F. 172-1T/30 of 15th November. If I went oft friendly visit it would be preferable that I should not go by air but should proceed to coast in warship or Patrick Stewart and thence inland by car. If I arrived with escort of aeroplanes and accompained by a number of Royal Air Force officers it would give appearance of formal mission.

British Residency, Buiihirc, dated the 3rd December 1930. * ' • | ^ f . ^ ^ Many thanks for your letter of the 19th November 1930, which I found awaiting me on my return here the day uefore yesterday. It was very good of you to send me the photographs which i am very glad to have. My tour was on the whole very successful. For mj eight days on the Trucial Coast I had smooth weather the whole time and no difficulty about landing, etc. The latest developments regarding my meeting with Ibn Saud are that Ryan gave a dinner to Hafiz wahba which was attended by Laithwaite, uendel and one or two others in London. Hafiz .7abha apparently spontaneo sly opened the question of the Bahrain incident and it was discussed at length, Hafiz ^Valjfea was very helpful about the matter and said he would do his best to cle^ r up the misunderstanding# He is therefore suggesting to Ibn Saud that the latter should invite me to come to Ryadh or some such place on an informal and friendly visit of courtesyx it remains to be seen whether Ibn Saud will react to this; if he does it will be a very good thing. 1 think we should get more out of ibn Saud if we went on a friendly | visit than on a formal mission and I am therefore all for it» Apparently, however, time is short, as Ibn 3aud is only coming o Kejd for about six weeks, arriving early in December. I was very much interested in what you said about smoking being common in Nejd and the nowadays and K.R.P.Dickson,C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait.' b / and also about tribal caravans being allowed to come quietly into Kuwait. If a meetxne, can be arranged with Ibn Saud the moment would seem to be particularly propitious. As regards your request to be allowed to go on a hawking expedition to Safa and oack, I propose to sit tight over the matter for the moment. Firstly, as far as I know Ryp.n is not back at Jeddah and if the meeting with Ibn Saud is arranged in the near future, it would doubtless be easier to ~et permission from him then. /Iso I think it would be difficult for Ryan to move in the matter. He seldom sees Ibn Saud personally and if he approached Paud Kamza and asked him to ask Ibn Saud, etc.,etc., the latter will doubtless attribute to this innocent request all sorts of ulterior motives. I am sorry to say that unlike you I have not sold n^y mare to Rosenthal as, on arrival in Bombay, she was vetted unsound. I am now trying to see if the Kham of Kalat would like her and if he does not want her I shall probably have her shot. I hope the Admiral's Visit went off well. I met him at Hcnjam and found him most pleasant to deal with, and helpful in every way. ^Ith kindest regards to Mrs.Dickson and your self. ( V Jtty hSt* 1 Telegram 61/18. P.

I cannot enquire here in view of his hostility to ITuad and inacessability of Ibn Saud himself. It might be worth while | asking Minister informally how King reacted to report which he promised to send, but I do not think it specially importan to do so. I think that best course will be for me to write personal letter to Fuad referring to his personal lette of October 7th, since when there have been no developments at this end; to say that Biscoe is anxious to pay his respect to King dunn^ his visit to Nejd; and to ask if it would be convenient for His Majesty to receive him at Riadh or any place between there and Persian Gulf. I should emphasise the courteous character of the proposed visit, let Fuad understand that the proposal arises out of his own suggestion to me that I should take some further action to placate Ibn Saud. I see no objection to Dickson accompanying Biscoe and would propose to mention in my letter to Fuad the probability .... ■■■■ kprobability of his doing so. I would suggest no enlargement of party further except, of course, by addition of necessary servants, etc. It is desirable to avoid any appearance of delay. In opinion extent to which business can be discussed nust depend entirely on Ibn Saud's attitude, if and when visi: actually takes place. He will almost certainly touch on pending questions himself, but I see no prospect of his settling any of them. Best hope is that if King agrees proposed visit will restore complete friendly personal relations and enable us to judge better how to approach the stage of formal negotiations on Persian Gulf questions. Biscoe may find it possible to a^ree on list of matters to be discussed which, I think, will have to include not only those relative to Kuwait but also Bahrain que&gt;tions^espcclally in view of the recent exchange of somewhat acrimonious letters between Ibn Saud arid the Shaikh of Bahrain.

During the iJchwan rebellion His Majesty's Govern ment informed the Shaikh of Kuwait that if he acted in accordance with their wishes as regards the cutting off of supplies to the rebels, etc., they would, when peace was restored, endeavour to bring about a cessation of the blockade which had been imposed for saii# 9 years by Ibn 3aud on uwait* 4 # rhe Ohaikh of Kuwait did act in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty's Governmenti some supplies did reach ••• The Rt.Hon'ble Lord Pasofield f P«C*, His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.ref ch the reiels, but hey were certainly very limited in amount and i believe that a considerable proportion came from Batrah and other porta# 1 have frequen ly endeavoured to obtain accurate information as to what actually did brin^ about the final collapse of the utair and Ajman # They had arms and they had men 9 and no encounter on a lar b e scale took place between them and Ibn Saud's forces* . 11 my informatiori is to the effect that their final collapse was almost e tire* ly due to the fact that they had run out of supplies of every kind f both of fo &gt;d and of am &lt;unition 9 and that they knew that they could look for no support either from His Majesty's Government or the Jhaikh of Kuwait. They could obtain no shelter in 'Iraq or Kuwait and had therefore been obliged to march consiae able distances, and were at the end of their resources* This state of affairs was brou^t about very largely by the measures enforced by the Shaikh of Kuwait acting on the advice of His Majesty's uovernment, which he loyally followed, despite his own strong personal inclina tions. I believe that His :^aje8ty T s Government recognise ^ that this is so, and have every desire to implement their undertakings to the Shaikh to brin ( , about a cessation of the blockade and a restoration of the former prosperity of Kuwait* 5* I discussed a few days ago with the Shaikh the effect of this blocicade on his tsrrxtory &gt; and asked him what the estimated loss caused to him by it had been. S aikh Sir hmad told me that before the blockade the revenues of Kuwait amounted to between seven and eie^ht lakhs of rupees. Kuwait is the largest Arab town in lesopotamia or Arabia after Baghdad - a fact which possibly may not be realiseu* The Shaikh told me that despite the fact that taxation was exceedingly .*exceedingly li ht, 4 pe? cent on imports ano 2 per cent on exports, before the blockade Kuwait was one of the most prosperous cities in Arabia 9 and the ^tate paid all its expenses comfortably, and generally had a b lance to devoue towards improremeiitst etc» Xlowadayst tne revenue was below two lakns and despite the most stringent economy, the Stste had last year been unable to balance its budget, and the deficit had been made good by contributions from the private estates of the ruling family* 6. I asked the Sheikh to what he actually attributed the blockade, and he said ^entirely to the influence of the ^uasaibi family 1 *• 1 do not think this statement is wholly correct, though I think it is very largely so. I believe Ibn oaud, in the past, at any rate, was actuated partly by personal ambition to round off his territories by reaucin^ Kuwait to the status of a feudatory. On the other hand, I do not think there is the least doubt but that the blockade was originally imposed owing to the influence of the .uastti- bis, and that nowadays it is maintanned owing to them, 7, The : uasaibis, as His £ jesty^ Government are aware, are Ibn oaud 1 s bankers. They are oi tumble origin and entirely self-made men, and, I believe,in former years were twice msde bankrupt. Subsequently, however, they got in touch with merchants on the Hasa coast, Hoffuf, etc.,and gradually amassed a considerable fortune by lucky deals in pearls and other means, and ultimately started financing Ibn Jaua, Jfor some years they farmed the iiasa customs and uhen prevailed on ibn oaud to divert trade with liejd from uwait to Bahrain, ^jair ana xiofful, supported in this by the influence of the Hasa merchants. They are said to receive a salary of Rs,5000 a month from Ibn Saud and to make ,,,' make enormous profits on goods order &lt;4, t&gt;y Uim Iroin India# 1 is currently reported that they arc owed seren to c-Uht lakhs by ibn 3aud at the present time, and I think there is no douht that they wield much influence with the King* To turn now to Ibn Saud 1 s desiderata* He has stated - vids Mr^Bond's despatch Mo.150, dated uhe 19th June 1929 to His :£aj esty * s Secretary of State for Joiei^n ffairs- thet there are three questions which he wishes to raise in connection with the Persian Gulf* (1) Customs and transit dues collected in Bahrain on ^oods imported into Sejdi (2) certain points relating to the nationality and passports of Hejaz«»Kejd subjects in the % Persian Gulfj (3) the position of Ibn Saud*s agents in Bahrain and Kuwait* As regards (2) and (3), I see no particular difficulty in discussing these matters with Ibn iiaud. I do not know what he wishes to discuss regarding passports, ete« 9 but the matter will probably be capable of settlement without much difficulty. As regards the status of his agents at Bahrain and Kuwpit, I think if it were pointed out to him that the grant of consular status to his agents in Bahrain \ and Kuwait would inevitably lead to similar requests from Persia^ and 'Iraq, he would not press the aatter # iioreoTer there is no doubt that the Sy .ian entourage of Ibn £aud are not on good terms with the .uasaibis) Abdut- ^ahman ^uas&amp;ibi told me this himself in Bahrain and probably they would not welcome any increase in the (Luasaibi |&gt;reati e in ahrain, and therefore their influence would be utilised against -the proposal. q J • • • •9 # The most important question however is that of ^hrain transit dues. As regards them f 1 think it mi^ht he AAC pointed out to Ihn Saud that these dues acre very definitely levied for services rendered* The Bahrain Government have provided at Bahrain, wharves^ warehouses, lighting, a orane, and in fact all the facilities that are provided in a civilized port, so far as their finances permitted. They are even now contemplating an extension of the pier, which will cost a Iprge sum of money, and will enable lighters to corae alongside at all states of the tide. Further, the transit of goods - and Ibn Saud*s Imports are frequently on a very large scale • involves clerical labour, and the provision of guards 9 watchmen, etc* 10« Ths Hedjaz (government benefit by all these facili ties and it is not much to ask that in return they should pay the wery modest rate of 2 percent customs duty, and the request that these transit dues should be waived is in the circumstances wholly unreasonable* 11* If Ibn Saud cho ses to tranship his goods on the high seas, then obviously he can avoid payment, but so long as he utilises the facilities provided by the Bahrain Govern- ment, he has no reasonable ground for protest if he is asked to pay something towards their cost* It is not a tax levied by the Bfhrain Government on his goods, but a charge made for definite services renaered. 12* I do not think therelore that there should be any particular difficulty in discussing the demands of Ibn Saud in connection with the Persian i /ulf. »te are on very strong ground in maintaining the present positioii* 7h« question now arises as te whether any pressure can be brought to bear on him to relax the Kuwait blockade* Possibly, Ibn ^aud may have ***hare abandoned his personal ambition to include Kuwait in his territories; he has Many othe^preoccupations and his attitude towards Kuwait has been markedly more friendly of late; some eduoin hare been allowed to purchase oods in Kuwait, though the cararan traffic is still entirely prohibited* There is still howerer left he influence of the ^uasa^ois, which will certainly be exerted for the maintenanc of the blockade. If I was discussing with Ibn iaud A -i should, in the first instance, make an appeal to his better nature. Ibn Saud knows perfectly well that he owes practi cally everything to Kuwait. Kuwait gaye hia and his family shelter when they were refugees. It was with the help of the Kuwait tribes and the support of Shaikh ubarak, that he set out on the ccnquest of Arabia, which has led him ultimately to his present high position. So intimate were the relatione between Kuwait and Ibn Saud that, when Itn Saud was quRrrelling with t ie Ttrks, he used to send to shaikh Mubarak letters receired from the Turkish authorities, and Shaikh Mubarak used to write the replies and seal thea with ibn Saud*s own seal, which was in his possession^ fsr Shaikh Mubarak had the reputation of being a skilled and forcible writer. ibn Saud is undoubtedly iapulsiTe, and is capable occasionally of a 'grand geste*. It is possible - though perhaps not probable • that if an appeal was made to him on behalf of Kuwait, pointing out the ruin that his present policy was bringing on this small principality, to which he owed so much and how unworthy his attitude was, u vine, regard to all the circumstances of the ease, jHttflf he might respond. I beliere that he would if he were entirely free in the iuatuer. He is however apparently almost at ...at the end of his financial resources# iie owes already a considerable sum to Jals bankers, tht ^uasaibis, and aiay hare need of further assxstance from them and they are doubiiless capable to bringing much pressure to bear on him* If then, ti this method of approach fails, there would seem nothing for it but to adopt a sterner line and to hint to ibn Saud the possibility of retaliation* 14. Ibn Saud clearly realises that it is in our power to retaliate. hen 1 met him last year # he said to me 1 I am not friendly with the British because I particularly love them, but because I realise thAt they have got me by the throat*. The best retaliation that i can think of would be the raisin^ of the Bahrain transit dues to 5 per cent* -e imposea a reduction of the dues on the Jhaikh of Bahrain forcibly and against his wishes. They are a constant grievance to the Shaikh, and moreover the Bahrain State is at present passing through a period of acute financial stringency. I doui t whether it would be necessary to put the threat into execution. The intimation would, of course, have to be tactfully conveyed, but I believe, that if Ibn Saud saw that liis Majesty's Government intended to get their way in this matter, he would yield, ana this view I may mention is shared by Co. onei Dicks n who knows xbn Saud intimately. The cessation of the blockade would certainly please the merchants of it mi^ht be supported by Fuad Hamza as a blow to the uasaibis and possibly iipfia 'ahba would use his influence on the same side. There would there* fore be some counterpoise to the £uasalbi Influence which ml^ht induce Ibn Saud to a^ree to a restoration of the previous caravan traffic between Kejd ana iuwalt, and a restorationrestoration of the prosperity of this city# 15. To sum up: v i; the blockade is slow^g ruining Kuwait at the present time* (il) it is therefore most important that His Majesty's CrOTer /jaent should implement their undertaking to the Shaikh to try and bring about a cessation of the blockade with as little delay as possible. (iii) J would myself in the first instance make an appeal to Ibn Saud* s better nature, pointing out all he owes to Kuwait and the harm that his present policy is causing. It is probable howerer that his present financial straits and the influence in consequence exercised orer him by his bankers, the uasaibis, would prevent his modifying this policy* In this erent the only course to adopt would seem to be to hint at retaliation, e «g* the raising of the Bahrain transit dues. There may be other means of brin^in^ pressure which may suggest themselres to His .sjeety f s ttiriister* ( iv) Ibn Baud has mentioned three matters which he on his side wishes to discuss with me* I do not think there is riny need to avoid a discussion of these questions, as one of them is probably capable of friendly set lament •••settlement and as regards the other two we are on very strong ground. 16.

For Resident to make journey to 'eddah for the purpose of private courteous visit to Ibn Saud would be to give matter disproportionate importance. It is already agreed that it would be undesirable for Resident to conduct official negotiations at Jeddah. Subject therefore to any observations which you nay receive from Government of India or the Political Resident in next few days you should merely express satisfaction at liquidation of incident regretting that Resident's duties do not permit of his absence from his post ( for?) so long as would be necessary under their visit to Jeddah, and (gr. omitted?/ opportunity for meeting may arise at some future date. As regards Persian Gulf questions you should not refer to them unless raised by Hedjaz Government and in that case should adopt non-committal attitude.

I can never forget the time we spent in the desert and jour charm, kindness, attention and consideration as '£■ well as your most valuable help during those difficult negotiations the credit for the successful conclusion of which is mostly due to you. I was glad to learn from direct enquiry as well as from a perusal of the letters exchanged between His Majesty King Abdul Azeez and Sir Andrew Kyan that the misunderstand ing concerning the Bahrein visit had disappeared. I trust that the opportunity may soon present itself to you to visit Jiddah so that you may settle some of the questions which His Majesty wished to discuss with ^ou last year and at the same time remove any remaining trace of misunderstanding. Lt.-Col. H.V. Biscoe, Consul - General of Gt.Britain, Bushire, Persia. 1May I add my own sincere hope and confident trust that during ^our term of office we ma^ see the full realisation of the closest friendly relations between the British Government and the Arabs. i?or my part, my policy Is, as you know, to enaeavour to establish the best relations between the Arabs in general ana King Ibn Saoud In oartlcular on the one side and ureat Britain on the other side, and this Is the policy I snail always support with all my strength. In conclusion I thank you once more for your very klnd letter and trust that I may have the pleasure of seeing you soon say In the summer If ^ou are spending the summer holidays In England. With sincere regards and best wishes for your health and happiness, Yours Very Sincerely,Bushire, the 5th March 1931.

I too look back ^rith pleasure upon our meeting in the desert; to the honour I had there of conversing with His Majesty King Ibn Saud, and to the friendship that I have established with yourself.

No. 2816/409/43, t S _ f ^ 1 *'&gt; k BRITISH IEGATI0U, JEDM. December 28, 1930. A -^N My dear Fuad Bey, In your personal letter to me of October 7 you were good enough to forward to me a statement prepared under the instruction of His Majesty the King regarding the Colonel Biscoe incident. As my present letter arises out of what you said in your covering letter, I feel sure that His Royal Hi^iness the Minister, whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, will forigve me if I pursue this somewhat delicate matter with you instead of addressing him direct. Your letter suggested that it might 'be well to take some further action vis -a -vis of His Majesty. I considered very carefully in London in consultation with the authorities there what could be done in this direction. While we feel that the matter was technically closed by the letters already exchanged between the King and myself, we are all most anxious to remove any unfavourable impression that may remain in His Majesty^ mind notwithstanding the readiness which He has shown, as you said in your letter,to forget the incident. It appears to me and to those whom I consulted in London that the best way in which Colonel Biscoe could shew how far from his intentions it was to give any offence to the King would be for him to pay a personal visit to His Majesty in order to pay his respects and with a view to the renewal of the completely friendly relations between them which existed last January. The King's visit to Hejd affords an opportunity for this. I therefore write to ask you to submit my suggestion as soon as possible to His Majesty and to enquire whether i * would be convenient to Him to receive Colonel Biscoe at/at Rladh or ainy other place easily aooessible from the Persian Gulf ooast before He returns to the Hejaz* The visit would be essentially one of courtesy, made with the object indicated above, although if His Majesty should give Colonel Biscoe en opportunity of discussing in a general way any matters of business, it would contribute materially to their eventual settlement. He would propose to take with him Colonel Diafcson, who is well and, T think, favourably knowp to the King. I realise that the King does not contemplate a long stay in nejd and I regret that it was materially impossible for me to put the suggestion forward before His Majesty left Mecca. I think, however, that if it could be communicated to Him by an early courier, there would still be time to arrange the visit. Colonel Biscoe would be prepared to start for Riadh or any other aooessible place without delay on learning that His Majesty was able to receive him. I would telegraph to Bushire and London immediately on receiving an intimation to that effect from His Royal Highness the Minister or from Your Kxcellency. Time would perhaps be saved, if His Majesty preferred to send a message direct to Colonel Biscoe e.g. through Colonel Dickson at Kowait or in any other way that would ensure its rapid transmission. I would ask you, when submitting the above suggestions to the King, to forward the enclosed personal letter, as it refers briefly to the suggestion connected with Colonel Biscoe, I should be glad if His Royal Highness and Your Excellency would peruse it. Believe me. Yours very sincerely, ANDREW RYAK.P.Z. 512/31. TV V EIIClOSUREbIN FORICIGrK OFFICE COVERING LETTER, DATED 26th JANUARY, 1931. Ko. ^.2 8 6/4/^5. to. 2814/409/44. BRITISH IEGATI0H, JEQDX. Deoember 28, 1930* J Your Majesty, After Compliments, I returned to Jedda on Deoember 19, accompanied by my wife. My first duty on m&gt; arrival was to enquire after Your Majesty 1 s health and I was greatly pleased to learn that it left nothing to be desired. I have the honour to confirm the thanks which I asked Fuad Bey to convey to Your Majesty in reply to the gracious messages which you were pleased to instruct him to deliver to me. Both my wife and I were deeply touched by the proofs of friendship shewn to us on the occasioiiof our arrival by Your Majesty and those whom You had instructed to welcome us. I am myself, thank God, completely restored to health. I hope for continued strength to devote all my efforts to the settlement in agreement with Your Majesty and Your Government of all questions of common interest to our two countries. I took advantage of my stay in England and to discuss many of those questions^I found everywhere the strongest desire to deal with them in a spirit of friendship and mutual confidence. I learnt with pleasure on my return of the new arrangements sanctioned by Your Majesty for the conduct of foreign affairs and I am confident that they will facilitate the relations of our Governments. I do not wish in this letter to trouble Your Majesty with matters of business. As, however, Your Majesty/i'l -U/ Majesty was graciously pleased to return a favourable reply to the personal letter whioh I wrote from Dijon in August 38, T am aslcing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit a suggestion that Colonel Bisooe should reoeive Your permission to pay his personel respects to Your Majesty during Your adjourn in Hejd. He is very desirous of thus proving to Your Majesty the complete sincerity of his regard for Your person. T trust thut Your Majesty will approve of this suggestion which I am malcing with the full approval of my Government. I share Your Majesty's regret that the necessity for Your departure fcr Fejd at the moment of my arrival here should make it impossible for You to receive me in person until after Your Majesty's return. I look forward with impatience to the time when I shall be eb le to request the honour of an audience. In the meantime, I pray that lour Majesty's stay in Kejd may be prosperous and that God may continue to grant You the health and strength for the accomplishment of the many tasks imposed on Your Majesty.

'' Y - I must ask you to forgive me for not having written sooner and for now writing 'briefly. I am quite well again but have 'been very pressed since my return. I do hope that your own leg trouble is done with. I am sorry not to have made a more conclusive Job of the great reconciliation. Still I think that Ibn Sa ! ud has been driven from his position of unreasonable re sentment and can no longer refuse to meet you when an oppor tunity offers. I have not seen him since his return to the Hejaz and know nothing of his future movements he prob ably does not yet know himself. I have just had an intens ive week of your friend Yussuf Yasin, vice Puad Hamza who went sick on December 21st and went to Egypt on January 30th. Yussuf Yasin was on his best behaviour. I think Ibn Sa^d must mean to ask us for something soon; money perhaps, which he wonH get, unless the City is trusting enough to provide it. I agree with you about Kowait; but the first fence now in sight is Bon Voisinage with Iraq. Faisal has offered Lt.Col.H.V.Biscoe I.A.- V uf/u/ offered to send Nuri Pasha to fix up everything and Ihn Sa'ud has reacted favourably. This is all to the good although there are many snags ahead. On receipt of your last telegram about the Kowait share in the £10 ,000, I sent a long message to the Foreign Office. I am afraid they rather resented it, after having let themselves 'be hung up for months by Iraq's scandalous attempt to raid the whole of the money; ,but the trick is done and you should get a draft for £3000 at the same time as this letter.

BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, March 19th, 1931. A* \ u *i{J^ iK Many thanks for your letter D.O.No.58 3 of 7th February, which crossed one from me. There has been a tre mendous fuss and worry over the Trans-Jordan frontier and for a time it pushed all other political subjects into the back ground so far as I am concerned. Things are now calmer although the question is still unsettled. You will receive by the same mail as this a copy of a despatch which I am sending to the Foreign Office about Persian Gulf negotiations. For the reasons there given, I have abandoned for the time being my intention of reviewing the situation. Your despatch No.3 of January 31st really covers all the ground and it shews that we are in agreement on one most important point, viz:-that when we engage Ibn Sa'ud on the Kowait questions which interest us we need not shrink from discussing his desiderata as well. Your outlook on the course of eventual negotia tions is more hopeful than my own but the prospect of your being able to conduct them yourself is now greatly improved. I may add the following points (a) Ibn Sa'ud will certainly stay in the Hejaz until Lieut-Gol.H.V.Biscoe, I.A.■until after the Pilgrimage i.e•until the beginning of May, 'but his subsequent movements are incalculable at present. (b) Yussuf Yasin is very much in Ibn Sa'ud's confidence and now that Puad Hamza is out of the way, per haps permanently, I think he will play a r5le in this matter. I agree, however, that only the King himself can settle it and, as regards Yussuf Yasin, much will depend on whether the King takes him with him when he next goes to Nejd. The King has recently shewn a tendency to leave the actual discussion of affairs a good deal to the 'com petent Ministry', which means Yussuf Yasin, as the Amir Faisal, though head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shews little ability to deal with or interest in his new job. (c) Whatever happens, I hope we may be able to talk matters over in the summer. If all goes well I should leave here about mid July and be at home about the beginning of August.
