B. 379. ADEN. The question of the administration of Aden involves three areas :— (i) Aden proper, ?.e., the small area of British territory (some 75 square miles) surrounding the harbour (to which is attached also, for administrative purposes, the island of Perim with its coaling-station and lighthouses, lying some 100 miles away at the entrance to the Bed Sea) ; (ii) the Aden Protectorate, a very much larger area extending in all directions (to a minimum depth of about 40 miles) and occupied by a number of independent Arab Chiefs bound by treaties made through the Aden Residency with the Government of India ; (iii) beyond the limits of the Protectorate, the territories of Yemen and A sir,, formerly Turkish provinces, but since the war governed by their own powerful Arab rulers—the Imam of Sanaa and the idrisi. Aden itself was captured in 1831) by a mixed force of the Bombay Army and the Indian Navy despatched from Bombay. It is by law a part of “ British India,” and is administered by a Resident appointed by the Government of India, assisted by officers of the Bombay Political Department. There is a garrison consisting at present (February 1925) of one Troop Cavalry (the Aden Troop), one British Infantry Battalion, one Indian Infantry Battalion, one Flight B.A.F., one Company R.G.A. (Coast Defence) one Signal Section, one Fortress Company (Sappers and Miners) and one Defence Light Section (Sappers and Miners), and the Political Resident is also General Officer Commanding, Aden Brigade.. The civil population of the British territory is made up, in round numbers, as follows;—Arabs 33,000, Somalis and other Moslems 7,000, Jews 4,500, Indians 3,000, Europeans 500. Before the war the Aden Settlement and Protectorate were administered entirely by the Government of Bombay and Government of India, under the ultimate control of the Secretary of State for India, and the Government of India were also responsible for the defence of Aden. Shortly after the outbreak of war the Government of India assumed control also of political relations with the Temen and Asir as well as with the Protectorate. But as a result of changes introduced in the course ol the war, and intended at the time to be temporary and provisional only, the system of administration at the present time is complicated and anomalous. In 1917 it was decided to transfer the control of political relations (he., primarily, relations with the Yemen and Asir, but the arrangement has been applied also to political relations with the Protectorate) to the Foreign Office, and military control (defence and operations) to the War Office, leaving the local administration in the hands of the Government of India. On the formation of the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Office in 1921, that Department took over the functions of the Foreign Office. The resulting position is highly unsatisfactory. The General Officer Commanding and Political Resident is now r responsible to four separate higher authorities, the Government of Bombay (and through that Government to the Government of India and the India Office), the Colonial Office, the Commander-in-Chief in India, and the War Office. It has been impossible, under such arrangements, to avoid some degree of confusion and friction. The Government of India have pointed out that on the military side no clear line has been drawn, or perhaps could be drawn, between defence and administration, and the Resident has explained that some military questions are now' dealt with by the War Office, some by Army Headquarters, India, and some by both these authorities. Similar difficulties have arisen in regard to the distinction between ‘‘political ” and “administrative ” matters. The arrangements of 1917 moreover leave the question of incidence of expenditure, as will be explained more fully later, in a position which cannot be maintained indefinitely. They were indeed, as already indicated, intended only as makeshift arrangements to be revised after the war. Their prolonged continuance is causing inconvenience in all directions, and it is very desirable to settle the question on a permanent basis without further delay. The question falls into two divisions : (i) by what authority shall Aden in future be administered ? and (ii) on what revenues (and in what proportion if there is a division of liability) shall expenditure at Aden fall? It appears that in practice financial considerations may determine the answer to both questions; but it will nevertheless be desirable to consider the twm questions separately on their merits. 78 50 1.25 AAs regards the first question, the suggestion that Aden should be severed entirely from India and transferred to the administration of the Imperial Ciovernment has been made more than once in the past, and apart from the developments of Indian public opinion in the last year or two, no objection, it is believed has been taken to it in principle in recent years. The Government of India themselves ottered in l.X)o (subject of course, to financial conditions which will be noticed latei) to tianslci Aden and again in 1917 they expressed their concurrence with the proposal The connection of Aden with India is indeed little more than a result ol the historical accident of its capture by a force from India. The direct interests of India in Aden are not great. Only a numerically small proportion of the present population is of Indian birth (though tlie Indian residents include many of the most prominent merchants, and have taken a leading part in the growth of the Settlement and Port), and India’s share in the export and import trade, though important, is not preponderating. „ . , • ... i p On the other hand, the situation of Aden, its position in command ot the most important trade route of the world, which unites Great Britain not only with India but also with East Africa, Mesopotamia, Ceylon, the Ear East, and Australia, and its proximity to the Hedjaz, to Central Arabia and Somaliland, render the control oi its policy and defence a matter of Imperial importance. The decision to create a naval base at Singapore would appear to accentuate the force of these considerations. Urn understood to be the view of the General Staff that, having regard especially to possible constitutional and political developments in India, Imperial strategic interests would best be secured by the transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government. 1 he requirements of a unified Middle Eastern policy presumably point m the same direction. The Masterton-Smith Committee, on whose report the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Ottice was set up, recommended that Aden should be taken over by the Colonial Office, and the recommendation was approved by the Cabinet, subject to the approval of the Government of India, which (primarily for financial reasons) has not yet been obtained. . . . Against such positive reasons, from the Imperial point ot view, lor transferring \den has to be set the fact that a very strong feeling against transfer in principle has been manifested recently in Indian political circles. In September 1921 the Council of State passed a resolution in favour of the retention of Aden by India with only one dissentient. There is no reason to think that the Legislative Assembly would take a different view, and the Government of India have promised that the matter will not be decided without giving the Assembly an opportunity for discussion The Government of India have reported since that Indian opinion has continued to harden ao-ainst the relinquishment of Aden. The only chance of obtaining the assent oi the Indian Legislature would appear to be for His Majesty’s Government to offer terms so financially attractive as to outweigh other considerations m a time of financial stringency. . „ „ • , i • i -u i 4 . i ~i This introduces the question of finance, with which it will be necessary to deal at some length. A table is appended ghowing, according to the latest information available in the India Office, the total expenditure at Aden, and its division between Imperial and Indian revenues, for each year since 1910, and for some earlier years. It will be seen that before the war the total cost of Aden worked out approximately at 200 000L a year. Prior to 1900 India bore the whole charge, civil and military. In that year the question was examined by the Welby Commission, who recorded the opinion that “if the Empire were organised as a whole, Aden would be an Imperial charge, towards which the members of the Empire would contribute, but in the absence of such an organisation another arrangement must be made, and the equity of the case would perhaps be met if the United Kingdom were to contribute one-half of the military charges.” (The civil charges, it will be noted, are compara tively insignificant in amount. 1 lie whole question is in effect one of militai\ pursuance of this recommendation it was arranged that from 1900 onwards, thou a h Aden continued to lie administered by India, the obligation of the Impeual Government should be recognised by their making a contribution of a fixed annual sum of 7 9 000Z towards Aden charges, in addition to bearing half the capital outlay on special’ defence works. This contribution has continued unchanged up to the present time (supplemented only 7 , as explained belou, by an additional conti ibution in respect of additions to the strength of the garrison due to the war). of ( X ()TF _The contribution actually credited by the Home Government in respect Aden was nominally 100,000b ; but of this amount 28,000b was really in substitutionfor n portion of u contribution towards tlic cost of the Indm Office iccomnieiidod b_\ the Welby Comniission, and consequently 72,000?. only of the total really relates to Aden.) Tn 1917, when military responsibility for Aden was taken over by the War O.lOe and political responsibility by the Foreign Office, it was not found possible, in the stress of war, to mark the change by any readjustment of financial responsibility. The charge for internal administration was left on India, but subject to the under standing that this was without prejudice to the complete transfer of Aden, charges and all ^subsequently—India claiming that in the event of such transfer the new arrangements as regards incidence of cost should have retrospective effect to 1917. One effect of this arrangement, as interpreted in practice, has been that Indian revenues have continued to bear (though only in the first instance, and subject to the possibility of readjustment) charges arising out of political relations with 1 the Protectorate, although the Government of India have ceased to control these relations. During the war the cost of Aden greatly increased, owing both to actual military operations and to the growth of military charges generally. The arrangement made was that India should meet the cost of the pre-war strength of the garrison at current rates—subject to the above contribution of 72,000?.—while the cost of any additional forces maintained there (described loosely and not altogether accurately as the cost of 41 Aden operations'') should be equally shared between India and His Majesty’s Government. Before describing the course of the recent discussions as to the future incidence of expenditure, reference should perhaps be made to the proposals made by the Government of India in 1903 and 1917. In the former year they offered, if Aden were transferred, to contribute to Imperial revenues 77,000?. a year in respect of Aden; but in 1917 they expressed the view that, if Aden were to be completely severed from India, India could not thereafter equitably he called on to bear any share of the cost. The question was taken up again on the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee (which did not itself make any proposal for the division of expenditure). The Government of India, after considering the Committee’s recommendations, telegraphed officially on the 1 Ith April 1921 that they were prepared to agree to the transfer of Aden to the Imperial Government, and to make from Indian revenues a contribution of 100,000?. annually, subject to the clear understanding that this should be regarded as a final quittance, and that His Majesty’s Government would then be responsible for all charges connected with Aden, whether military oi ci\il, including subsidies to chiefs in the Aden Protectorate. The question was further discussed in private correspondence between ^the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for India and the ViceToy. Air. Churchill proposed ihat India should make to the Middle Fast Department an annual contribution of a lump sum for a period of years to cover her share in the cost of Aden and also the services which the new department would perform in safeguarding Indian interests in Arabia generally, and originally suggested 500,000?. Mr.'Montagu subsequently agreed to place a figure of Rs. 50 lakhs before the Viceroy and the Indian Council. This figure corresponded roughly to the cost of Aden to the Government of India in the then current year, and assumed broadly that, while some reduction might be caused by economies in military expenditure, this saving would be set off, so iar as India was concerned, by her assessment to some portion of the liability in respect of the contemplated subsidies, Ac. The \ iceroy in private correspondence expressed the view that he could not possibly propose to his Council a higher contribution than 250,000?. a year. On the 15th September 1921 the Colonial Office proposal that India should pay Rs. 50 lakhs a year was officially telegraphed to the Government of India. It was explained that, in consideration of this contribution, the Middle East Department would— (a) bear the whole cost of Aden administration, military as w^ell as civil; (?)) accept the whole responsibility for any subsidies found necessary ; (c) relieve India, if desired, of the cost of the administrative establishments on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf; ami (d) undertake to do all that was possible to protect Indian interests in Arabia, as well as to consult the Government of India on all important points of policy. The amount of the contribution was to be open to reconsideration after five years. On the 27th September the Government of India telegraphed that it was impossible for them to assent to the Colonial Office proposal. Even if they were prepared4 themselves to uccept, the induxu Ijei^ishituie would ceitcimly decline- to i&lt;itii^ theii action. , , . . . , , , On the 14th December 1921 the Viceroy telegraphed privately that, although Indian feeling now appeared to be opposed to a transfer on any terms, he would be prepared to endeavour to obtain assent to transfer, coupled with a contribution of 200,COOL a year from Indian revenues; but lie w r as very doubtful of success, and suggested that it might be better to propose only 100,000/. a year, which India might regard as reasonable as being His Majesty’s Government’s nominal contribution to Indian revenues under existing circumstances. Several months later the Colonial Oflice suggested that the whole question mi 'lit be considered by an inter-Departmental Conference, and it was in fact discussed at a meeting of the Middle East Committee at the Colonial Office on the 21st October 1922. At that meeting, the India Office representatives endeavoured to put the discussion of incidence of expenditure on some definite basis of principle. Taking as a starting-point the Report of the Welby Commission, which held that the British Empire apart from India, w'as interested in Aden to the extent of one-halt, it was pointed’out that, since the date of this Report (1900), the proportions of Imperial relative!v to Indian interest had been greatly increased by the acceptance of new British responsibilities in the Middle East (especially in connection with oil), the development of Australia, New Zealand, the Straits Settlements and Ceylon, and the rise of Japan. It was suggested tentatively that India’s contribution to the expenditure on Aden might now be assessed at one-third instead of a half. The Secretary of State at the same time telegraphed this suggestion privately to the Viceroy mentioning also that General Scott hoped to be able to reduce the total military expenditure to 415,000/. The Viceroy in reply expressed his willingness to endeavour to put through a proposal on these lines if liis Majesty s Government would make one ; but Indian opinion had continued to harden, and wms now set on On the 24th January 1923 Lord Peel wrote (privately) to the Duke of Devonshire suggesting that, taking 450,000/. a year as the military expenditure the annual Indian contribution to the total cost of Aden should be fixed at lo0,000/. a year, subject to revision after five years, it an offer on these lines were forthcoming, Lord Peel would be prepared to abandon the claim to retrospective effect prior to 1st April 1920. , . On the 20th February the Duke of Devonshire replied that this solution was “quite unacceptable” to “the Colonial Office. On the 8th March Lord Peel wrote pointing out some apparent misapprehensions on the part of the Colonial Office, and asking for a more explicit statement of the Colonial Office position. 1 o this letter no reply has been received. . _ , . rl ni . , , , •Meanwhile the Government of India had on the 5th l ebruary telegraphed officially offering to advocate the transfer of Aden in the Indian Legislature on the basis of India being relieved of all but one-third of the net cost, subject to a maximum of 150,000/. in any one year, on the understanding— (1) that expenditure connected with the Imam and the Idrisi should be excluded ; and | (2) that the question of retrenchment, and especially military retrenchment,. should be investigated by a special Committee. If transfer were made on this basis, they were prepared to waive the claim to retrospective readjustment from 1917. In the alternative, they were prepared to resume full control of Aden and the Protectorate; and they pointed out that in this case also iinancial readjustment was clearly necessary. I hey considered t hat equitably His Majesty’s Government should now be asked to contribute two-thirds ot the net cost of Aden and the Protectorate ; but they W'Oidd nevertheless be w illing to accept a contribution of one-half. They stipulated that all political and military expenditure involved by relations with the Imam and the Idiisi (of which they, were willing to assume control, under His Majesty s Government) must continue to be borne entirely by His Majesty’s Government. Finally, they suggested as a possible way out of existing difficulties a com promise under yvhich the existing temporary arrangements would be legulansed and developed. The Aden Settlement would remain part of India, and the civil and municipal administration yvould be retained under the Government of ludia , al the rest, military administration included, yvould be transfened to His Majesty s Government. Under an arrangement on these lines, they yvould be prepared tonf T, nd T t egislat n re a fixe(1 aDllual contribution from Indian revenues of _00,00ub the Jnchcape Committee, it is to be noted, advocated a similar compiomise, but proposed to leave the local military administration as well as the civil and municipal administration, in the hands of the Government of India The Government of India recognised that the position under such a compromise would be anomalous, and friction inevitable. The same criticism may perhaps be applied to iui proposals foi lesuming control of the Settlement and Protectorate with a reservation as to the Imam and the Idrisi. It is to be noted that the Resident at Aden has recently expressed the view that “ it would not be practicable to treat eithei our political or commercial relations with the territories of the Imam and of tie Idnsi as a separate interest to be controlled independently of Aden and the I lotectorate. 1 he Imams boundary is coterminous with that of the Protectorate into which he can easdy descend, although he himself is practicallv inaccessible to oui forces. I he affairs of the lemen generally must inevitably react on those of y en and its I rotectorate, and must be an important if not a decisive factor in deteimining the military strength to be maintained in them.” General Scott took the view that if India retained Aden, political relations with the Imam and the Idnsi, as well as with the 1 rotectorate, should be controlled solely by the Indian Government Ihe Government of Bombay have expressed similar views It should be noted that if Aden were completely severed from India, it would be necessary to make certain stipulations for the protection of Indian interests. These how e\ei, would, it is thought, create no serious difficulty. The essentials are that tie ugit o appeal to the High Court of Bombay in criminal and civil matters should leimiin, that Aden should continue to bo a free port (this is probably secured bv luternat.onal Agreements) or that at least no tariff hostile to IndL trade should be intioduced, and that there should be no racial legislation or segregation, similar to t ie measures directed against Indian settlers in East and South Africa. In the financial spliere it would also be necessary to come to some arrangement for recouping to India the value of buildings Ac., transferred. In regard to expenditure, reference m.n also be made to the possibility that (following on the suggestion of the Welby Commission) other parts of the Empire might he asked to contribute to the cost of Auem Probably m practice such a request could be addressed only to such portions o 1 C Empire as are specially interested, and one suggestion is that such portions should between them contribute one-third of the total, ie., one-half of the non-Indian share. But this question is one for His Majesty’s Government, and for tile Colonial Office m particular, rather than for the India Office. Various other questions of detail would also have to be settled in connexion with a decision either that India should resume full control or that some compromise such as that suggested by the Government of India should be adopted. But these need not perhaps be specified here. It may be mentioned, finally, that the Government of India telegraphed a&lt;mm omciaHy on the 1 Ith June last (1923) asking for an early reply such as would enable tnem to place concrete proposals before the Indian Legislature. July 1923. L * D ' M ’ The above memorandum was drawn up for the Secretary of State (Viscount Peel) in J ul^ 1923. A meeting of the Standing Sub-Oommittee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 23rd of that month (at wffiich the Secretary of State attended) recorded its opinion that Aden is of greater strategic importance to the Empire than to India, and that, so far as strategical considerations are concerned, it would be advisable for the administrative responsibility for Aden to rest with’ the Imperial Government. Viscount Peel endeavoured to follow^ up this conclusion by means of a peisonal discussion with the Duke of Devonshire ; but no material progress w r as made. Lord Olivier raised the question a year later with Mr. Thomas, but the latter’s illness, followed by his depaiture to South Africa, prevented a discussion of the matter by the two Secretaries of State. Since the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in July 1923, therefore, no advance has been made towards a settlement of the Aden question. 78 [TABLE</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000375_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B379</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000375</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B379</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Aden'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1924</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-10T18:33:49</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 36, and terminates at f 38, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
