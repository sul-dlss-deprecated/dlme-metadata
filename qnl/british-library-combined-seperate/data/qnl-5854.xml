It includes correspondence, not only between Government of India, India Office, Foreign Office, War Office, and Treasury correspondents, but also between Bin Saud and various British officials. Much of the correspondence documents the (unsuccessful) efforts of the British to persuade the two leaders to meet. Also included in the volume are reports by British officials regarding the dispute, and a copy (in Arabic) of the Treaty of Sèvres.Both parts include a divider that gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00011e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00011e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00011e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
