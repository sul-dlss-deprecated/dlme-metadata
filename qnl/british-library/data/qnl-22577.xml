Dear Sir: In my letter of November 23 ,'1943 I advised that the Company was making plans for the installation of a causeway off shore from Sitra. Under date of December 6, 1943 you answered giving your approval to this proposed project with certain recommen dations^ for providing passageway for small 'boats to which the ^ Company agreed. I have noted the contents of your memorandum No.G/138 of 17th January 1944 in which it is observed that fish trap oumers may claim compensation for alleged decrease in fish catch due to the existence of the causeway. The Oomnany is prepared to pay reasonable compen sation to fish trap 'owners in the proximity of the causeway in those cases where the fish traps have 'been in existence prior to the granting of the Company reservation and where the fish trap owners can clearly demonstrate that their catch has oeen adversely affected 'by the causeway. Secently a fisherman whom I think is named Adarit Ogaf Chafarya has started the construction of two fish traps within the Company reservation, one of which will undoubtedly require removal for the causeway. The site chosen for these fish trans does not appear to 'be a good one as they will be on high ground most of the time; also the Company records do not indicate that there has previously ever been traps at these locations. The Company contends that it should not be responsi ble for any damage caused to the above fish traps and that no compensation of any kind is due to the owner of these _isn The Company would appreciate it if the Bahrein Government would so inform the owner of these traps.

Dear Sir, ROYALTY TANKS File #075.1 For some time we have had under consideration the necessity to clean and re-bottom Royalty Tanks Nos. 152 and 153 which have been in continuous service since May 1937. The matter was first discussed with the State Engineer in 1941 when it was decided that the work could well be left to a later date# However, the present level of sediment in each of the tanks is approximately four feet and, in addition, although no leakage has occurred to date, it is thought that the tank bottoms are badly corroded. We shall be glad, therefore, to have the approval of the Bahrein Government to proceed with the cleaning and re-bottoming of the tanks and to use tank No.133 for Royalty Measuring whilst either 152 or 153 is out of service. Tank No.133 has been re-bottomed which will entail recalcula tion of the calibration tables. Similarly with tanks Nos.152 and 153 after the repairs have been effected. This recalculation will be done by Messrs. B &amp; R Redwood^ representative when he arrives late in the summer to strap the new construction tanks. Meanwhile, the old tank tables may be used since any difference will be negligible. Tours faithfully. W.P. MDERSON, CHIEF LOCAL HEPRE3MTATIVE, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM OOlffAKT LIMITED. cc.

ROYALTY' MEASUREMENT - BUHNER FUEL TAMES File #075.1 Dear Sir, Under existing arrangements Tanks Nos. 253 and 35S are in use as Burner Fuel Tanks, but owing to operating changes it will be necessary to transfer these tanks to other service. In their place it is proposed to use tw new Tanks Nos.462 and 464, which, pending the arrival of Messrs. Redwood's representatives, have been strapped by our own Engineers. At the changeover any stock remaining in Nos. 253 and 353 will be transferred to N'os,462 and 464 and during the period of this transfer (approximately two days), since dead gauges will be unobtainable, no claim for royalty deductible on Quantities consumed will be made. This arrangement has the verbal approval of the State Engineer but I shall be glad to have in due course your formal agreement to the change as outlined.

Existing tanks 133 and 134 and a new t ank- 143 will be used to receive Arabian crude oil and for the purpose of ascertaining the ratio of Arabian crude oil run to total crude oil run to the Refinery, official measurements will be taken of all deliveries from these tanks. If you are in agreement to this change, I will appreciate your obtaining the approval of the Bahrein Govern ment. As it is desired to make the change around the end of October, 1944, your early action will be desirable. The accounting details involved in making the change as well as the date of the change will be advised you as soon as I have been informed of the Bahrein Government's approval to the above Yours very truly, Fbr W.P.

I pointed out that as regards the medical officer who was accused although there was no doubt that he was cqrrectly discharged by the magistrate trying the case there as also no doubt that had he been practising in the est he would have been subject to disciplinary action by the General-Medical Council for permitting an unskilled dispenser to dispense his prescriptionn.

These two technicians are at present working at Bahrein Island for the U.S. Govern-* ment but are due to proceed to Calcutta to work for the British on an erection of tankage under a demand placed by the War Office. The movement and passage i§ a British responsibility. We are informed that they will be available to move during the last week in November and it is extremely important that they be transported with the minimum of delay in order to commence work on the above mentioned project during the first week of December. As there is no British authority at Bahrein to whom we can apply for movement of this personnel, it is thought that the most suitable solution would be to apply to your office, ■^•he names of the civilian personnel to be moved are Messrs.

Clarke, may request British assistance tn connection with his own movement from the Persian Gulf to India but it should be noted that his movement is not a British responsibility but as he is supervising work for the account of the British Government it is felt desirable that his movement be facili tated and the Chief Engineer of the B.A.S. states that any application for priority made \y this gentleman would h»ve his Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, Bahrein Petroleum Company, Bahrein, Persian Gulf. full support E.W.ROOTHAM MAJOR for SGD E.

I gave you this morning. The Bahrein Petroleum Company have erased all record of their belated letter of dismissal, and Mr. Packer has asked me to re-draft my application for employment with Petroleum Concessions fLimited.(Copy enclosed). The Assistant Political Agent has checked my Birth Certificate and other papers entitling me to a British Passport, and has asked me to give him the completed application, photographs, &amp; etc. on Saturday morning, which visit I hope will not cost me a day's pay! In view of my having had no option but to resign from my present Company, and having intended to complete the remaining half of my foreign Service Agreement with the Company, I hope they will not turn the erasure of their letter terminating my services, to their advantage, and claim that I am not entitled to a Pirst Class passage home, or the monetary value therof. The Company have very generously stated that, if I wish, I may leave prior to the completion of my term of notice, without prejudice to pay outstanding on whatever remains of the three months notice from the eleventh of November 1944, but still refuse to grant me my fortnight's local leave, which is now overdue. As I explained this morning, this leave is our due but is granted at the Company's convenience. I At the moment I am familiarising myself with the lines and equipment of a new Unit which is not yet completely built, and which I shall not be here to operate!

Petroleum Concessions Limited, Manama, Bahrein Island, Dear Sir, I have the honour to submit my application for a position on the Staff of your Company, I am twenty-seven years of age, a British Subject by birth, and wish to continue ray career in the Oil Industry. I should mention that I had no intention of resigning my position with my present Company, if my hand had not been forced by the unfortunate incident of which you are familiar. Having been selected to operate a new Alkylation &amp; Liquid Phase Isomerization *Unit, I have reason to believe that my career with The Bahrein Petroleum Company would not have been unsuccesful. My present Salary(plus Cost of Living Allowance) is Rs. 530 per Month, with furnished Quarters, Linen, Messing,&amp; Servants, provifled by the Company. At a conservative estimate, I value this in all at £700 a Year. I would however be willing to engage at a much lower figure, if I can have a reasonable guarantee of permanent employment, all or part of my service at Haifa, and a Pension at the conclusion of twenty years unbroken service. I trust you will forgive my offer of service being given with conditions, but I am not seeking any form of temporary employment. Hoping my qualifications, experience, and past records of service, with which you are familiar, have met with your approval, I am. Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Copy to: H.B,M,'s Political Agent.

MEMORANDUM Reference your letter of the 7th of December 1944, 2. I have not had an opportunity of examining your Foreign Service agreement but I should think it likely that the Bahrain Petroleum Company will object to providing you with a First Glass passage unless you have completed the usual qualifying period of service. If the agreement does not specifically state that you are entitled to receive the monetary value in lieu of passages to which you may be entitled then it is highly improbable that the Company will be prepared to make you a cash payment. Political Agent, Bahrain.D.O.NO. C/1749 10th December 1944. My dear Ward Anderson, 1 had an interview recently with a member of your staff who as I understand recently resigned from the Company. He ' told me that he had asked for permission to come and see me absence from work Mr. peifer indicated that permission would not be given and that if he absented himself without permission ho would forfeit a day's pay. It is unfortunate that my office and your works observe the same weakly holiday and that it is not convenient for me as a rule to see people in the late afternoons. However, if it is not possible for British subjects to see me on business without buffering financially I will endeavour to arrange for special hours during which I can be interviewed. I shall therefore be grateful if you will inform me if Mr. Feifer's alleged decision was based on a standing rule of the Bahrain Petroleum Company or whether it should be considered as exceptional. but that in spite of the Refinery Manager having agreed to his Yours sincerely Ward P.

Major T. Hickinbotham, His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, BAHREIN. Dear Major Hickinbotham, Please refer to your letter D.O.No. C/174-9 dated 10th December, 194-4. I assume that the member of our staff referred to in your letter is Mr. Crookshank, All I can say is that Mr. Crookshank's statement to you is a gross and deliberate misrepresentation of fact. I have checked with Mr. Fifer, who states that Mr. Crookshank several days ago called him on the telephone at about 10 p.m. and asked if he could have the following day off to take care of some business in Manama. Mr. Fifer states that Crookshank definitely did not say that his business consisted of going to see you, in fact Mr. Fifer gathered from information earlier in the day that his business consisted of goinp to the Bank, although Mr. Crookshank did not state what his business was at the time he called Mr. Fifer that evening. Mr. Fifer told Crookshank over the telephone that unless he planned on leaving the Island shortly there would hardly seem to be anv great rush about getting permission at that late hour of the night to take the following day off to take care of business, and that in any event he should arrange such matters with his foreman. Mr. Crookshank called Mr. Barkhurst immediately after the above telephone call to Mr. Fifer and through Mr. Moser, Assistant Refinery Superintendent, it was arranged that Mr. Crookshank have the following day off to take care of his business. The policy of the Company is that all employees who are British subjects are free to come and see you at any time, in fact in cases of dispute they are encouraged to come and see you. In cases where it is necessary for our employees to come and see you during working hours on what can he con sidered legitimate reasons, you may be assured they will suffer financially.No. C/PA-191. - 2 ' 11th December, 1944. I shall be pleased to discuss the Crookshank case with you at your convenience. This man has been acting a very nasty'manner recently and has been a thoroughly undesirab employee and would have been discharged within a few months of his arrival here had it not been for our extreme shortag_ it of manpower and the Company's efforts to make use of ev 7 manpower available, if at all possible. One of Mr. Crook shank's failings is continued abuse, including physical abuse of our Indian'and native employees. One incident involved the striking of an Indian employee on the head with a Piece of n pfpl resulting in a sizeable cut on the Indian s head. This incident was witnessed by staff employees. We recently served notice on Mr. Crookshank, but he came in and preferred to resign instead. This wish was accommodated and our understanding at the moment is that Mr. Crookshank has resigned and is continuing to work after a fashion pending transportation. Yours very trrfly, W. P.

Jan.,reporting that I had missed the Tanker 'British Gratitude', whose Captain had offered me a free passage through the Suez, and had hinted at the possibility of being able to see me all the way home to England, I have to report a very unfortunate mistake made by one of the Bahrein Petroleum Company's Post Office Mail Sorters, which has cost me that passage. You no doubt remember receiving a letter from me marked 'Urgent' and stating that there was a possibility of my obtaining a passage on this Tanker, for which I needed an Emergency Certificate for return to the United Kingdom.I also stated, from advice given by the Bepco Personnel Dept., tht^c I should need this Certificate within two days. That is on or before the 30th.Dec.'44. Finally, as you know, the boat sailed without me yesterday Morning, as I had not obtained this Certificate in time. I had been puzzled for some days at receiving no reply to my urgent letter to you, and remarked on this to the Personnel Manager, who had warned me to be ready to sail on this Ship. He replied that his Asst. was phoning the Agency on the Morning of the 31st.Dec., and would enquire about it. This I understand was not done. This Afternoon, your reply to my letter, written the same day ( 28th.Dec.'44.), was found in the wrong mail Box, Not only did your letter inform me that you could give me the Certificate I required, but written as promptly as it was, I could,and would have collected it in time to sail on the 30t^ Dec., two days before the boat actually did sail, as the 30th. was the date for which I had been warned to be ready. Your letter was very clearly and correctly addressed to me. As far as I know, this is the first time a mistake has been made in sorting my mail, but it's been a very costly mistake as far as I am concerned, I presume that legally I am entitled to no form of compensation, but thought that you would like to know why I did not act on your very prompt reply to my urgent letter.
