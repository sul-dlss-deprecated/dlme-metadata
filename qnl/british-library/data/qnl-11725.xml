The watercolour drawings are rendered directly onto watercolour paper and captioned in ink, usually on the verso of the preceding folio, though at times along the lower edge of the drawing itself.The images date from a honeymoon trip taken by Toynbee between 1879 and 1880 on a British India steamer from Calcutta to Bombay. Thereafter, Toynbee stayed in Bihar with friends, including George Toynbee (probably her brother-in-law), joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector at Patna. Toynbee continued to depict landscapes along her route home along the Arabian and Red Sea coastlines as well as at Suez.Elements:1 ‘Farewell to Orissa?
