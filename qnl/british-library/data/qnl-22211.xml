(Hejaz, *est Coast of Arabia). Two American engineers (Twitchell and Crane) have recently carried out investigations, and the i. etroleum Department brought the matter to the notice of the «nglo-xersian oil Company. It is regarded as important that every endeavour should be made to enable British interests to establish themselves in the Persian #ulf area. the position is complicated by the fact th*t the Anglo*, orsian Oil Com- -pany...3. Co&amp;pany who axe geographically heat suited to undertake aevelopement work, are virtually excluded from operating in this area except as a nominee of the -‘‘rad Petroleum Company. i -he same remarks apply to the w&gt;hell. The circumstances which have led up to this position are as follows: ^aaiUan-alLkka .UagwiugUatl s ato-^ a Bt^Q** The Turkish letroleum Company i now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912 when the Deutsche jjank became associated with the Eati ;nal Bank of Turkey and the Anglo-Caxon Ietroleum Company (lioy&amp;l huch-hhell ^roup) in order to press certain claims to oil rights in Baghdad ana Mosul, including those attached to the h a gh- -cad -hallway C nceaaion. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo**! ersian Oil Company which had for some time been in negotiation with the Turkish (loTanaaent* In 1914 an Agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution ot the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the Mati.nal Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new p rtiolpant* being the Anglo- -Tersian Oil Company, 30T; the Anglo-^axun Petroleum and the heuteche Bank each. Thit Agx eement also i* provided that the tyreo groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the pro- -auction oi oil in the Ottoman -mpire in Europe ana ^sir except in &lt;gypt, huwait or the Transferred Territories, except through the ursish Petroleum CoKpany. This Agreement was signed by the British and German Govexnments and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then precominantly British, this arrangement hra the effect ox ^ecuring the whole ox this area to interests which were xx^edominantly British. After the entry of...&gt; m entry of Aicerican and French inlereBte into the Iraq 1 etrolevim Gotfipany aft or the war, the arrangement as regards non-competition jetween the groups composing the Iraq i'etroleuia Company was oontinned in an agreement between the gi'oups, entered into in l^d. This was i a private agreement between the groups with which the British government was not concerned. Under this Agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded Kokeit and the Farsan Jslnnus, cut included Bahrein which dtriinoa an seek for or obtain oil concessi ns otherwise than through tue aq etroleum Company or its n minee. The position as ,regai'ds the distribution of capital in the.Iraq reiroleua Company is as follows; «*«*.'»*loan ^roup was h^ld in the i 1 lowing proportions: otanaard ^11 epan,i of New Ceroey 41 % utanuard ©il Company Company of New fork 41 2 /^ % Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsyl vania id v 3 % as the jri^yai hutch Chell is oO hutch anu 40,1 i^z'itish, the British shareholding in the Iraq ietroleum Coiapany now only re. resents ao :ut Soto, £*+*4.**+w The Iraq 1etroleum^is technically a British ; ompany, as in Article S2 oi its Convention with the Government oi Iraq, the Company must be and remain a -ritish Company , registered in Great .Britain, ana the Clmlr- -man must be at all times a British subject, -ne Angio-ji ersxan oil Company, Koyal riutch Chell French Group no•Yb&gt; as,75 a as ,755 5.00S In 1932 the American Shareholding in theGuo question which arises is whether E.i .Gov tinment can he expected to afford the same measure of support to the Iraq Petroleum Company as it could in the old days when it was a -British Company in fact as well as in name.

This does not however affect Koweit as it is excluded from the 1928 Agreement and it only makes it all the more important to see that tne Anglo-Persian oil Company secure the Eoweit concession.

Mr. Parkinson called attention to the latest telegram from Kuwait reporting that, on being consulted by the Shaikh regarding the last offer by the Anglo- Fersian Oil Company, Major Holmes had immediately offered more favourable terms, on the tondition that he should be allowed to submit a new draft concession allotting the northern part of Kuwait to the British, and the southern part to the Americans. 2. General discussion regarding the intention behind this new proposal showed that there is reason to believe that Major Holmes may have discovered, as a result of IVj. V of his explorations for water, tfcat one area has more o: hearing possibilities than the other, and that it is not out of the question that the part to be allotted to the British might be comparatively unremunerativ©. From information previously received from the Shaikh it is understood that the British area would comprise 1,200 square miles and the American area 400 square milee, anc that the initial payment in the case of each separate concession would be He.45,000. 3o llVo Parkinson asked whether it would be practicable or advisable for Ilis .Majesty* s Government to intervene at once on the ground that the new proposal t&lt;: divide Kuwait territory was unacceptable* kh:° Rendel was inclined to think that to take this line might place us in a somewhat invidious positic Moreover, he saw some difficulty in Intervening'at this .stage when we were unaware of the exact nature of the proposal and had not yet learned the reactions of the Angio-Persian Oil Company. In any oc.se it would seem desirable, before tendering further advice to the Shaikh : to wait until the respective offers of the competing Companies might be regarded as more or less final. 5* In reply to a question Mr. Starling said it might be poesible, on general principles, to take the lint that Kuwait was too small comfort ably to accommodate two oil concerns. It must, however, be borne in mind that recent indications suggested that British interests might wish to acquire a footing in Bahrein* Bahrein was con siderably smaller than Kuwait and we should, therefore, he well advised to watch events in Bahrein before vetoing the new proposal merely on the ground of the smallness of KuwaitKuwait. Subject, however, to developments in Bahro:.n, ha ©aw no reason why His Majesty* 8 Government should not adopt such an attitude with a certain measure of justification. 6 . The suggestion was made that the Shalhh shoula be told that he must accept the advice of His Majesty*s Government on technical matters. It was pointed out that the Shaikh had, in effect, flatly contradicted whe advice tendered by His Majesty*s Government on the technical aspects of the two original draft concessions by asserting that, in his opinion, the Syndicate’s offer, as it stood, was the better. 7. After some discussion it was agreed that would not be within the terms of our pledge to insist on the Shaikh accepting our advice, even in technical natters. We could only give him our advice and warn him that by disregarding it he would be endangering his own interests. ■TMeutenan t- Colonel Fowle expressed the view that the Shaikh would probably accept advice so tendered. 8 . Lieutcnant-Coloneh _i;owle. al so said that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were being Kept well abreast oj. all development s. 9 . The conclusion was reached by the meeting that nothing could be done until we had the draft of the new 'twin * 11 concession proposed by Major Holmes, and that it would be desirable to send a telegram to the Acting Resident asking that the draft should be obtained from the Shaikh, ready for the Resident on hie arrival at Kuwait. II. KUWAIT HEUTRAK 20HR . 10. Mr. Parkinson said that recent iniormation from Jeddah showed that the question of a. concession in t) 2 neutralneutral SBone might again come into prominence, and he presumed that this would 'be dealt with quite separately from any oonoession in Kuwait proper* He understood that the concession said to have 'been granted in 1924 by the Shaikh and Ifcn Baud had never beoome operative, or was, in any case, now null and void. 11. It was generally agreed that the Shaikh should he told that he rauot obtain the approval of His Majesty 1 s Government before granting any concession in the neutral zone. Owing to the pressure exercised by the United States Government he had been told that in the matter of the concession in Kuwait proper the ultimate decision must rest with him; and it was suggested that he might wilfully, or under a genuine misapprehension, oc; without reference to Hie Majesty’s Government in regard to the neutral zone. 12. Mr. Rendel expressed the view that we must proceed with some core in the matter. Our right of control in the neutral sone was less than in Kuwait, and it might consequently be difficult to justify the adoption of a more rigid attitude in re\ard to the former area than in respect of the latter. 15. It was finally agreed that no written communica tion on the subject should be mode to the Shaikh at I present, but that the aeaident should remind him orally that he must obtain the approval of His Majesty's Government before granting any conceesion in the neutral sane. The Resident should also take steps to discover what had actually happened in 1924, when a concession in the neutral acne is said to hare been granted to the Saetem and General Syndicate.III. QS^Kd. 14. The meeting had some further discussion about oil in Ctatar, during which it emerged that, in addition to the action approved by the meeting on the 26th of •April, the Shaikh should be reminded of his obligation lunder Article IV of the 1916 Treaty not to grant any concessions in respect of his territory without the approval of His Majesty’s Qovernment. The Petroleum Department would also take a suitable opportunity to bring the position unofficially to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 15 , In the course of the discussion the position of the Iraq Petroleum Company in respect of oil concession in the Persian Gulf was mentioned, hr.Starling explained that Qatar was one of the territories in the Persian Gulf in which the members of the Iraq Petroleum Company group had undertaken not to seek concessions without the approval of the other members. If the Iraq Petroleum Company insisted in standing on the Agreement this would mean that any concession obtained by the Anglo Persian Oil Company in Qatar would have to be passed on to the Iraq Petroleum Company. In these circumstances, we had to face the posaibility that the Iraq Petroleum Company, which although e British Company, had large foreign interests, might eventually secure a footing in the Gulf# The Petroleum Department had for some time thought that it might be desirable for the whole question to be brought under review sc that all the .uepartments concerned might be uble to consider the matter and fcr.Starling enquired whether It could be considered by the—r\ the Middle Bastern Suto-Coattittee of the ^onmlttee of Imperial Defence. There nae always the possibility that the Iraq Petroleum Company would take the line that their hands were full in Iraq and that they would not interest themselves in these smaller areas in the Gulf. In that event they might allow the Anglo Persian Oil Company whioh was very interested in the Gulf to take up concessions. (Since the meeting the Petroleum Department has learned unofficially that there are indications that some of the Groups in the Iraq Petroleum Company are not disposed to support the Iraq Petroleum Company's efforts to secure a concession in Kaea), l6 „ Mr - Parkins on said that h© tfrougivt; the fcaiddl© Eastern Sub-Committee oould deal with the matter, if a memorandum were submitted by the Petroleum Department, or alternatively there oould be an Interdepartmental discussion* It was agreed that the Petroleum Department should initiate any action that might be required in this connection as and when they thought fit, by way of a memorandum which would be sent in the first instance to the Colonial Office. IV. . n *_ » T 4 M V. S~\ iQ IT. *■? A, i i 17. The meeting first discussed whether the Company is entitled to an extension of their prospecting .^licence under Article IV of the 1 Q 25 Agreement. The mi!I “ 1 ^ nt “ “ e “ ueJ fact that the Company had used the word 'entitled' in theirtheir letter of the Article IV provides that an extex: aion of the —' prospecting lioenoe up to twc/ years may be granted if the Shaikh on the advloe of/the Political Resident is satisfied that such an/extenslon is justified. The Acting Resident has stated in a recent telegram that the interpretation is not 'quite free from doubt 71 . It was therefore decided that* on the whole, it would he better to obtain legal advice on this point, and that auoh advice had better be sought from the Treasury Solicitor. In the meantime, however, the discussion would proceed on the aesumption that the Company were not entitled to an extension. l9. In connection with this point Captain Prior said that Major Holmes knows quite well that the Company oaanot claim an extension as a right, and that he had, in foot, urged the Americans to be content with the one year's extension already granted. Captain Prior understands that the relations between the Anar leans and Major Holmes are not as cordial as they might be. 19« The meeting then discussed the alternative proposal submitted by the Company that in return for the right to seleot 200,000 instead of 100,000 acres they should make the Shaikh increased annual payments and a loan to be repaid from royalties. 20. StcTlipfl said that on balance he thought it would be better not to grant the Company the increased area. He pointed out that the Company had not. asas they should have done under the terms of the 1925 Agreement, selected areas when they took up their prospecting licence, and it would, in his opinion, he better to insist on their taking out a mining lease, which would involve the selection of areas, and thus leave the field open for another Company. There were, in fact, recent indications that uhe Anglo-Persian Oil Company were interested in Bahrein. 21* Some doubt was felt as to the actual area affected by the concession. The right of exploration had been 'throughout the whole of the territories under his (the Shaikh*s) control', and the prospecting licence should have been granted over ''areas to be selected by the Company”* Accurate information regarding the area of the whole of the Shaikh^ dominions was not available, but Captain Prior suggested that a figure of 156,000 acre would be somewhere near the mark* Captain Irior also said he was given to understand that drilling could be carried out in the open sea at a depth of 15 to 20 feet, 22 . It was generally agreed that it would be better not tc permit an extension of the Company’s area, but that another year's extension of the prospecting licence should be considered and that the revision of the mining lease should be now taken up*23. Hr. Parklnaoa tfcen asked the viewe of the meeting regarding the suggeation which, according to unofficial information, the Bahrein Government had put forward, that in return for the grant of one year’s extension the Company should make him a loan of Rs .60,000., repayable from royalties when the latter exceeded one lakh in the year. Re thought the suggestion was worth consideration as the terms of repayment would preclude the Shaikh from getting into financial difficulties with the Company. 24. After some discussion it was decided that the question of the grant of an extension in return for a loan to the Shaikh should be linked up with the amendments which His Majesty’s Government desire to see introduced into the raining lease« &gt;25. As regards the desired ©jnendments to the mining lease, Mr. Starling said that he did not anticipate that the Company would raise strong objections especially as the Agreement had already heexi altered to the advantage of the Company» He explained that it would have been out of plaoe and cumbersome to overload the agreement in the first place with detailed provisions which would only apply if and when the existence of oil in commercial quantities had been proved. This stage had now ^ been reached in Bahrein, and all the amendments suggested by the Petroleum Department were such as are commonly found in agreements covering a ’’proved'* area.~7o 20 4 Captain Moore said tiia-t tha Admiralty attacked great importance to securing the right oi pre-emption and introducing provisions for a proportion of the * oil to be refined in Bahrein, He extilained that Admiraltir nut^n/mn wnm no nrcultte-; Captain Prior aaid that the Shaikh had already evlnoed some interest in the question of oil reining in Bahrein.. 27 . It was finally agreed that a draft letter to the Company should he prepared in the Colonial Office, for the concurrence of the other interested Departments. The letter would make an offer, as from the Shaikh of Bahrein, of one year*s extension of the prospecting licence from the 2nd of December 1933 iia return for which the Company would be asked to agree to (a) A substantial loan to the Shaikh (i«e« in effect, advance royalties) to be repaid, without interest, from royalties over a period of 3 to 5 ye &amp;rs when the latter exceeded one lakh in the year* (b) fhe amendments to the mining lease suggested by the Petroleum Department. Wben approved the draft letter would be sent to the Persian Gulf for the concurrence of the local British authorities and the Shaikh of Bahrein. The amount of the loan would not be specified in the letter, but would be left for subsequent negotiations with the Company. B. Drillers. 28. Hr.Parkins on said that, in the first place he proposed to take up this question orally with Hr. Ballantyne and Hr.Lombardi, who had just asked for an interviewV interview. Major...

Mr # L&amp;ithwaite mentioned that Captain Prior had expressed the opinion that, if Major Holmes were required to reside in Bahrein for, say, ten months in ©very year, he would probably resign the appointment, if only for reasons of health. If this was so, insistenoe on euoh a period of residence might well be the easiest way out of our difficulties. Mr♦Blaster mentioned that it had been understood from oral discussions with the Company’s representatives that they would prefer to avoid a fixed period being laid down during which their/ Local Representative must reside in Bahrein. / Mr.Parkinson said he would prefer not to take any action in this matter until he had had an opportunity of studying tfhe statement of the facts which was to be drawn up/as the result of the discussions at the meeting of the 26 th of April.s QOPY SENT TO- INDIA OFF I CD, V/HITEHALD, S.W. !• 8th February 1934.

Mr.Eallantyne called urgently on January 26th to say that the Company (Standard Oil) had received from the Sultan of Muscat samples of oil seepages in Muscat for their consideration. The samples were sent to Bahrein and from there to Hasa for examination by the Calarabian people. Mr.Ballantyne emphasises that so far as he was aware the initiative in this case had come from the Sultan. The Company, before taking any decision as to the line which they would take as a result of being given this opening by the Sultan, felt that they had better report the matter to H.M.G. and ask whether H.M.G. had any views to express. I sa.id that so far as I knew this was the first we had heard of the Sultan’s action. I could not say what H.M.G,’s views would be but promised him an early answer. I added that we had had some correspondence both with Petroleum Concessions Limited and with the Sultan about an oil concession for the former but I did not remember of!hand how deeply we were canmitted to that Company in respect of this area. Mr.Ballantyne telephoned on the 27th to ask if he could have an answer. I told him that I had submitted the matter for instructions here and that it was desired to consult the various authorities concerned before giving the Company H.M.G.’s considered views. He said the Company were in rather a hurry and probably feared the possibility of others getting in ahead of them. I explained that another/31 / 2 . another Company was already in the field and had been for a considerable time, so that no question of that sort could arise. Mr.Ballantyne hinted that the Company might have desired to send Mr.Hamilton (who is at present in Bahrein) round to Muscat to see the Sultan, or alternatively to wait there until permission was received from His Majesty’s government for him to see the Sultan. Would H.M.G. be likely to object to that, if e.g. Mr.Hamilton applied for a visa ? I said I thought it would probably be premature to consider such a trip. The first step in any case would probaoly have to be taken through the Political Agent and not bj' direct contact between the Company and the Sultan. - ut I had nc authority to give him an answer to this hypothetical question. If Mr.Hamilton applied for a visa locally the authorities would no doubt refer the matter and t^at question could be settled in conjunction with the larger question. I suggested that it might be wise for the Company to wait for H.M.G.»s views, as they had asked for them, before d om ' any more - Tha t, however, was for the Company to decide There was of course no guarantee that H.M.G.’ s reply, when mad ~’ ^ ould De satisfactory from the Company’s point of view.

His communication to Company was made without consultation with Political Agent (no doubt owing to absence in interior). It will be nece discuss the whole question with Sultan on his his capital next month. Present position is that Petroleum Concessions Limited applied over a year ago for permission to negotiate with Sultan, permission was granted and Political Agent put the matter to Sultan who agreed to negotiate. Lack of further progress has been due to Sultan's absence from Capital.

In these circumstances we are anxious to know if our letter No. T/SA. 14/291^6 dated the 4th April 1942 has yet been acted on and if our No. ^VT/SA.14/2915 dated the 4th April 1942 addressed to H.H. The Sultan of Muscat has been delivered. If no action has yet been taken we should be very grateful if Mr. Felly (or Mr. Jackson) could be asked to ascertain the position on his arrival at Muscat. If it is possible we should be very grateful indeed if Mr. Felly (or Mr. Jackson) could ensure the delivery of our No. 2915 to H.H. and telegraph H.H.’s agreement to the extensions of the option periods. We should of course be pleased to pay for all the expenses incurred in the delivery of our letter and in telegraphing H.H.’s reply. As the option periods expire on the 23rd June 1942 we are anxious to obtain H.H.^s agreement as soon as possible and in time to pay the additional amounts involved into H.H. T s account with the Eastern Bank, Karachi. These payments should be effected on the 24th June 1942. We should like to know if there are any regular communications between Muscat and Salalah, wireless, aero planes or local craft, as, if Mr. Felly finds himselfT/SA.14/3037 (conoid.) unable to help us, it might be necessary for us to send our own representative to contact with H.H. We feel that this would be a difficult matter to arrange at such short notice.

The Political Resident feels that the. proposals suggested to him Py yuur Company’s representative for the extension of the option periods with the Sultan of Muscat and the exploration agreement with the Sheikh of Ajman were not altogether satisfactory. Je recommends instead that agreements should be negotiated with the Sultan extending the option periods on the Muscat-and-Oman and Dhofar concessions from 24th June, 1944 to' 24th June, 1949, and i/itn the Sheikh of Ajman for the extension of the whole agreement f rom 23rd March, 1944 to 23rd March, 1949^ a provision being inserted in each case for the further extension of the agreements to allow your Company to continue their exploration for a clear five years after the conclusion of the war with Germany.

We are, however, almost certain to be faced with a demand for a separate agreement by one or other of the de facto rulers in the Jabal and its neighbourhood. We should, therefore, be glad if you there has been no agreement or understanding the Sultan and the Oman tribes which sovereignty in Oman; in particular, the treaty o. &amp; 1 D in 1921 C?f presumably did not contain any clause of that nature?

He hopes in due course to communicate with Shaikh Sulaiman bin Himyar and to reach Muscat in order to see Sultan as indicated in my express letter under reference. 3. Company have asked me whether they should inform the Sultan of Bird's plans. I have advised them in view of the Sultan* s attitude to refrain irom making any communication to him on the subject but I suggest that you if you see no objection should let him kno&gt;&lt; orally what bird is doing. 4. Company have asked to be informed of contents of Treaty of Sib vide Muscat letter No.2052 of October 14th 1920. I have told them that I cannot communicate its contents to them without the Sultan's consent. If you see no objection please ascertain whether the Multan has any objection to our giving the Company a copy of the Treaty. 6 . For your own information. Bird has been held up near Buraimi by A1 bu Shamis who are making exorbitant demands. Bird has suggested making agreement with this and other tribes for about three years covering free passage and survey right. Apart from possible objection from Sultan to such agreements with tribes whom he claims as his subjects I consider that they would be of very little value as tribes would not honour them. Neither we nor Sultan are in position to give Company any effective assist ance. Have you any suggestions and do you think Company would find it easier to approach their objectives viz. I ski Ibri and Dhank via Wadi Samail. 6 . I understand Sultan wisnes to designate another bank under Article 27 of the Oil Concession.

I did not report the position more fully Because I had at that time only heard of Bird’s activities , -f-rnm Jackson — Bird himself 'being still in at second hand from Jackson Buraimi• Jackson was, however, reporting the progress of Bird’s activities in full to Lermitte, who must have passed on the information to the Resident. . i „iil now comment on the contents of the Resident s telegram. , .

Hy impression was that he is not author se By his Company to make formal agreements with anyone; hut that, because he thinks that they are more likely to honour C.j. Pelly, Esquire, Confidential. O.B.E., ?i HRArN r ECEIPT. Political Agent, Bahrain.written promises than verbal ones, he proposed to ask them for their permission in writing for the Company to explore in their area for the next three years in return for stipulated ad hoc payments* Bird realizes that there is a risk oi their dishonouring even written promises; but Shaikh Zayid, whom Bird consulted in Buraimi, thought that they would honour them. Also, Bird considers it better to try to get them to commit themselves now for three years in advance rather than that the Compa.ny should have to negotiate an entrance fee afresh every year. Bor the Company to have to do so would, he thinks, put the tribes in a position to increase exhorirbitantly their demands as the Company became increasingly committed. Their behaviour up to date certainly supports this view. For the season 1945,46 lermitte paid the A1 Bu Shamis Shaikhs about Rs . 2,000/- for permission to make a.geological survey - which the Company made. In 1947 Shaikh Kuharmad bin Rahmah asked Rs 10,000/- for permission to do a geophysical survey of a :; y sLll part of his area - involving about 2 hours- work and this year he asked at first Rs. 1 lakh a year for permissxon to survey and has now reduced the demand to Rs. 25,000/- a year, . without as yet costing himself to this figure for three years. It appears unlikely that the Sultan would object to these pay ments, which are not being deducted from the Company-s payments to him, and which, indeed, relieve him of the responsibilrty for obtaining entry for the Company into country which he may claim but over which he has no control whatsoever. Indeed, tie A 1 Bu Shamis absolutely deny that the Sultan has any suzerainty or even influence over them, and they are contemptuous of his pretensions^ I understand also that in 1945 Lermitte was permitted by your predecessor to negotiate direct with the A1 Bu Shamis. I have no papers to show that the Sultan raised t anv objection. ; According to the Shaikh of Fujairah all the Zakat . 0 . -i • _ nn iip C ted bv the Imam and the area is +-hP. Wadi Samail is coliecuea uy- 3 - no\ directly administered by him. Unless the Company could reach an understanding with the Imam, therefore, it would be impossible for them to reach Izki or Ibri by this route. By entering from the Horth-Vest, however, the Company hope at least to gain access to the Dhahira area (containing Lhank, Aflaj Beni Q,itab, Fazam etc), which is not under the Imam or Sulaiman bin Himyar, and possibly tc Ibri, in which Suliaman bin Himyar has great influence. Bird hopes to meet Sulaiman bin Kimyar in Buraimi to ascertain his reactions tc the Company s overtures. Further, this area is contiguous to the area they have have already surveyed from the Trucial Coast; and to survey it next is the logical and convenient continuation of their present operations* For these reasons, I understand, the Company regard the Wadi Samail as at present the more difficult of the two possible approaches to their objectives, jA &gt; v CONFIDENTIAL .
