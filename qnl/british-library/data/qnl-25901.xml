OCUMENT IS THE ANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT ^ ' PERSIA. \ ^Q^HDENTIAL. *2 frA [E -8446/42/34] June 30, 1941 /yg Section 1. rt.o. ; ?34r Copy No. 92 Mr. Eden to Sir R. Bullard [Tehran). Foreign Office, June 30, 1941. (No. 64.) THE Iranian Minister came to see me to-day, when he expressed his exuberant satisfaction at the war between Germany and Russia. He explained that his long stay in Moscowvhad caused him to hate bolshevism and all its works. He greatly hoped that the Germans and Russians would kill each other and that our power would in consequence be increased. I tried to make the Minister realise that the German attack on Russia might have serious ultimate consequences for his own country. However much Iran might dislike Russia, were the Germans ever to reach the Caucasus, the Iranians would find themselves faced with a much more serious menace. I asked the Minister to impress upon his Government that present was the moment for Iran to rid herself of the large number of Germans at present working in the country. No doubt the Iranian Government were watching their activities, but it seemed to me the time had now come to reduce their numbers drastically. The Minister replied that the difficulty was that these men were all technical experts whose services were most valuable to Iran. The Iranian Government had been unable to obtain such men from us, and to send them all away would have a serious effect on the country’s prosperity. I continued to urge the dangers latent in this arrangement, and the Minister undertook to telegraph my warning to his Government. I added that, if we could help by replacing some of these experts, we should be glad to do our best, though we were, of course, hard pressed for such men ourselves. 2. I told the Minister that I trusted that every necessary step would be taken to keep under complete control Rashid Ali, the Mufti and other refugees from Iraq who had taken part in the recent revolt. The Minister said that he felt sure that his Government were doing this. 3. I then told the Minister that we were making arrangements to deliver during the next few months material for the manufacture of twelve Hurricanes, and I°hoped that this decision, taken at a time when we ourselves had immediate use for all our aircraft in the Middle East, would gratify his Government, The Minister expressed his warm appreciation. As regards locomotives, I told him that I hoped shortly to write to him about these, but that the problem presented greater difficulties and I could hold out no hopes for the immediate future.

While satisfaction is still general in Iran (Persia) because Russia has been attacked, official circles are beginning to y/onder with some anxiety what the position of Iran will be if Germany becomes master of the Caucasus. Iranian Government have instructed their Ambassador at Moscow to assure the Soviet Government that they have no intention of departing from their policy of strict neutrality. [RECo. POL. DEPt -7 JUL.

Please telegraph to what extent in your view German attack on Soviet Russia necessitates modification of our policy in Iran. 2, There seems to me to he some danger lest Iranian Government should merely regard this new development as relieving them temporarily from fear of Soviet Russia. It is unlikely to occur to them that this is a valuable opportunity, and perhaps their last opportunity, for ridding themselves of dangerous German influences. If, however, Germany defeats Russia, German forces will presumably occupy the Caucasian oilfields, and Iran will at once be faced with the menace of German pressure,^and possibly of eventual attack. It is clear that Iranian Government should, in their own interests, take immediate steps to weed out the Germans now established in Iran, whose activities and intrigues may be so dangerous later as a possible means of advancing German policy by throwing Iran into confusion and threatening her independence. 3. You should if you see no objection, speak with the utmost seriousness to the Iranian Prime Minister on these lines, and should in general do what you can to stiffen the Iranians now as regards their attitude towards Germany.22737 Pr;'in:- Military CIPHER &lt;y INDIA DIRECT The War om£s&gt; OCpV Repeated C.-in-C., Middle East.
