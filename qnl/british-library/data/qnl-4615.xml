Be pleased to lay before Their Lordships, the I hoisted my broad pendant as Commodore Commanding, East Indies Station in K Bideford t? at Basrah at sunset on 6 th April. At 0900 on 7th April, I handed over the duties of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf to my successor, Captain C*M 3 Graham R 0 N* On 11th April I left Basrah in ”Bideford” and proceeded to Bahrein, arriving there p.m 0 12th April, 3o ^Norfolk” arrived Bahrein at 0700 on 13th April, and I transferred my broad pendant from f Bideford ,? to her on arrival* 'Norfolk”, 'Bideford”, 'Deptford' and 'Fowey' sailed from Bahrein at 0700 on the 17th April for exercises* 'Bideford' and 'Foweywere detached at 2l30*i and at 0600 on the 18th of April, accompanied by my Secretary, I transferred from 'Norfolk' to 'Deptford' at the entrance to the Rooka Channel for passage to Basrah preparatory to flying to Tehran to be present ac. the wedding celebrations of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Iran and Her Royal Highness the Princess Fawzia. 'Norfolk' proceeded to Bandar* Shapur to entrain the Royal Naval Guard and Band for Tehran* 4 0 'Deptford' arrived at Basrah at 1300 on the 18th of April* and at 1425 my party, which in addition to myself consisted of my Secretary, my Coxswain and two valets, left the Basrah Airport in two Valencia aircraft which had very kindly been provided by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq; we arrived at Habbaniya at 1610. The Air Officer Commanding was absent on duty but he had placed his house at my disposal and my Secretary and myself were accommodated there and were extremely well entertained by the R-AoFo Officers, dining in the Staff Officers* Mess* On arrival at Habbaniya X was informed that the Sari of Athlone and Her Royal Highness Princess Alice had arrived at Baghdad and that we were to meet them at Kermanshah the following day in order that the five Valencia aircraft conveying the two parties could arrive at Tehran together* This necessitated an early start from Habbaniya, and we left at 0455 on the 19th April and flew to Kermanshah where we arrived at 0730* The Airport is some three miles from the town and we were met on arrival by HcBoM* Consul (JoF^R* Vaughan-Russell Esq.) and the Governor of the Province* The latter*ecA.

The latter had very kindly provided tea and oakes for our breakfast which were tactfully supplemented by Mr* Russell with coffee, ham sandwiches and hard boiled eggs; this most welcome meal we consumed al fresco at the airporto The Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice,, accompanied by Captaiii G 0 A 0 BoHa\?kins, MoV o 0o, DoSoC*, RoN a and Lady Margaret Hawkins, who had left Baghdad at 0620, arrived at Kermanshah at 0815 o My Secretary and I had the honour of being presented to Her Royal Highness and the Earl of Athlone and the Royal Party then proceeded to partake of breakfast on the field of the airport as we had done three quarters of an hour previously io.e* using fingers as opposed to the more conventional form of forks and laiives® The clocks having been advanced half an hour to conform to Tehran time, the combined party left Kermanshah at 10G0 and arrived at Tehran at 1310« 5© The flight was most interesting, and the scenery over the snow-covered Persian mountains was very beautiful; the only discomfort being the intense cold we experienced when v/e were forced to fly at 10,000 feet to clear the mountains, and a certain degree of bumpiness* At the airport at Tehran, an Iranian Guard and Band were paraded and Lord Athlon© and Princess Alice were received by His Majesty the Shah* s second son and high Iranian officials, also by His Excellency the British Minister and the Legation Staff* Their Royal Highnesses then proceeded to the house of Monsieur Ala (one time 1 Iranian Minister at the Court of St, James) where they were being accommodated and my Secretary and I were conducted to the Officers* Club where accommodation had been arranged for all the officers of the foreign Naval and Military detachments* 3 e At 1800 on the 20 th April* the RoN. Guard and * Band arrived from Bandar Shapur* The Guard consisting of 30 file and the Band of 20 were under the command of Lieutenant Commander M.G* Gopdenough, R«N*,.the second in command being Lieutenant DcPe Townsend, RoN« As I considered the presence of a Medical Officer was desirable, Surgeon LieutenantRT* May, R«Nt&gt; also accompanied the Guard* On leaving the Tehran railway station tne detachment was received by an Iranian Guard and Band* and, after I had inspected both Guards, the Royal Naval Guard marched through the town with fixed bayonets to the Academy (the local Sandhurst) where the men oi the foreip detachments were housed in great comfort during the - isit* Practically the entire population of Tehran turned out to witness the arrival of the Royal Naval Guard and Bam am the spontaneous enthusiasm of the poml a O 0 | indicated by clapping and cheers, was as remarkable as it unusoai* I was later informed by the British residents that they had never witnessed a similar demonstration by an Iranian crowd which normally is completely apa .hetico 7 ‘ Details of the entertainments, etc*, given during the visit are contained in enclosure No* 1 to this letter. 3East Indios letter No,618/E.I,166 of 4/6/39 (Cont*d) As Norfolk” had to arrive at Aden on the 2nd day to turn over to ’’Gloucester”, and time was an important factor, I decided to return to Bandar Shapur by train with the detachment, rather than by air to Basrah via Eabbaniya, The detachment marched from the Military Academy to Tehran railway station at 1830 on the 26th of April, where iracticaljy the whole of the British community was assembled to bid them farewell; the train left at 2000 to the accompaniment of Auld Lang Syne and tumultuous cheers. We arrived in Bandar Shapur at 2210 on the 27th April and embarked in ”Nprfolk” at 2246, thus ending a memorable and most interesting visit. I think I may claim that.the visit was an unqualified success. This was very largely due to the admirable arrangements made by all concerned. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to H.B.M. Minister, Tehran, Lieutenant Colonel H.J. Underwood, the Military Attach#, and to the Legation Staff. Not only were the arrangements made before the visit admirable in every way, but during our actual visit H.B.M. Minister and Mrs. Seymour and the entire Legation Staff were kindness itself, individually and collectively. We turned to them in any troubles major or minor, and all were met and disposed of with calm and rapid efficiency. We all received wonderful individual hospitality and H.B.M. Minister had caused tents to be erected in the Legation Compound for the ratings of the Guard, where they could take tea, enjoy the amenities of a wet canteen and buy curios, etc,, from a shop at fair and proper prices. 10 , The preliminary arrangements also involved the staff of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulfjin considerable extra work, which was cheerfully undertaken and well executed. Lieutenant Commander FoRoW. Parish, RcN,, Staff Officer Operations on the staff of the Senior Naval Officer, proceeded to Tehran 10 days before the visit was due to commence, and his arrangements in conjunction with the Military Attach# were admirable* and were responsible in no small measure for the smooth running of the whole programme. This officer, in addition, acted a© my Flag Lieutenant during the visit and was of the greatest assistance to me, 11. I wish also to record my gratitude to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq and the R.A.F. personnel, concerned, for providing aircraft to fly us to Teheran end for their hospitality to my Secretary and myself at Rabbaniya, and for all the arrangements made for our comfort during the flight. In this connection I consider it was very unfortunate that the R.A.F. personnel of the five Valentia aircraft were not officially of the British Delegation, Whilst the R.A.Fo Officers attended all the entertainments to which the British Naval Officers were invited, yet I feel that by not being officially of the Delegation they were at times placed in a somewhat invidious position vis-a-vis the Iranians.o o o East Indies letter No.5l0/E o Iol56 of 4/5/39 (Cent d) // ( 3 ) 12 0 ' Finally I wish to record my admiration of the. Royal Naval Guard and Band provided from 'Norfolk • I have already referred to the spontaneous applause they evoked from tne Iranian populace when marching to their quart,ees on arrival© They earned the admiration of all.during the march past at the review on the 25th April (see enclosure No 0 1) 9 when their marching was nearly as possible perfect, and their behaviouB in their quarters and when on leave was equal to their behaviour on parade, and was beyond reproach© I consider that Captain JoM© Mansfield, DoSoC©,. ReN©, the Commanding Officer of 'Norfolk^ and Lieutenant Commanded MoG© Goodenough, R©N©, the Officer in charge of the Guard and who was largely responsible for its training, are to be particularly commended© Lieutenant Commander Goodenough^s handling of the Guard, and his care for their welfare during the whole period they were out of the snip is deserving of the highest praise. Lord Athlone expressed himself particularly appreciative of the Royal Naval Detachment, and a copy of a letter he addressed to me on the subject forms enclosure No. 2 to this letter. 13© ' With regard to the Iranians, their attention to our comfort was such as at times to be a source of embarrassment© His Majesty the Shah had decreed that the foreign detachments were his guests and that they to be entertained accordingly© He would not hear of them being accommodated at their respective Legations© .I nave already referred to the fact that the officers were housed at the Officers 1 Club and the men at the Military Academy© The former is a brand new building constructed on a lavish and rather ostentatious scale on the lines of an ultra modern hotel© It was very comfortable, and the lood was good though the waiting was poor and at meals, particularly breakfast, the delay was very trying. Iranian Officers were detailed to act as hosts to all the foreign delegations© Attached to the British delegation were two military and two ki-n officers of whom the senior was Colonel + Their°attention^was unremitting, indeed it wasverydffficuit to move anywhere without on© or more of these o-ficere oeiiv, in attendance. On the arrival of Norfoxk at Bandar Shaour on the 18th April, Lieutenant Dahiralai Rahmatollah, Imperial Iranian Navy from the 'Palang' was present to act as P Liaison Officer and he remained with until they finally returned on board Norfolk on the 27th of Aoril: whilst at Tehran Lieutenant Colonel Arfa acted as Liaison Officer with the detachment^in addition. All these Officers could talk English and were of great assistance. cody of a letter of thanks which I addressed to the Minister of P War is attached as enclosure No. 3 to this letter. jam al so making a small personal present to each of the off icer^ concerned* but the prior permission of the Chief of General Staff^s necessary before the gifts can be accepted.^ Ibis nermiesion is being obtained by the Military Attache and the presents will be distributed by him as soon as it is received.o © o East Indies letter No 0 5l8/Eolol56 of 4/5/39 (Cont f d)o 14o When making arrangements for the visit, the one thing which gave rise to some doubt and misgiving originally was the accommodation which could be provided for the detachment in the traino It turned however that the arrangements could not have been betterfo The train which had taken the Iranian Royal Party from Bandar Shapyr to Tehran was sent straight back for the British Naval Detachment, and the accommodation was such that each man was provided with a sleeping bertho The food provided on the train was excellent and to see the men lunching off caviar and Caspian salmon was a delight o The 15 0 ' HoMo the Shah was graciously pleased to decorate all the senior members . £ he Q f and the recipients in the case of the British dele were the Earl of Athlone, Captain Hawkins and myself Earl of Athbne received the Order of the Crown - the highest Iranian Order, and Captain Hawkins and mysell the Order of the Homayun (Imperial Order;, With regard to my own Order, the circumstances under which it was presented to me form the subject of a separate lettero Captain Hawkins received the fourth class of the Homayun Order, but it subsequently transpired that his rank had been mistaken for that of a Captain in the Army and when it was learnt that his relative rank was that of full Colonel, he received a higher class of the decoration 0 10 General* I could not help being very impressed by what Ho Mo the Shah has achieved during the comparatively few years in which he has been in control of the countryc Tehran itself is an enormous city where the very new and ostentatious is inextricably mixed with the ramshackle oldo This* in itself is typical of the country where the prosperity of such towns as Tehran is in striking contrast to the abject poverty of the villages® The country is, however progressing; the railway from Bandar Shapur is a masterpiece of engineering, and was constructed at tremendous expense (one section of nine miles through the mountains cost £l, 000,000 - the.e are 127 t^nnels^ If, as is probable however it serves to onen up the country, its expense will be justified® Given very considerable capital, a vast amount could be done with the water power of the mountains and the fertile plain in the South, All this will however take years to accomplish and except in the larger towns there is no doubt that the country, judged by ordinary standards, is very backward. In this connection I received the 11 impression that the behaviour of a number of members of the Egyptian delegation was not altogether in uhe best of taste. They appeared to be bent on showing how suoerior was Egypt to Iran* and did not hesitate to indicate their contempt for anything which they did not consider up to ?hei? ?wn standard. The organisation of all the evening parties was certainly crude in the extreme, ninTicuiarlv with regard to time, but it is or interest tonotetliat the finll party given by H.Uo Queen Nazi! on. the night of the 25th April and run entirely by Egyptians, was more disorganised than any of the others.East Indies loiter No518/EoIol56 of 4/5/39 (Cont c d). 17o “Norfolk 7 * sailed from Bandar Shapur at noon on the 28th April and arrived at Aden at 1400 on the 2nd May.

That the so-called order had come from some very high authority is apparent, for when the Minister for Y/ar stated there was obviously some misunderstanding and gave orders for the band to be released, he was informed by the Chief of General Staff that he had no authority to give such orders as the original defections had come from someone much higher than himselfo 22nd of April 0 At 0930 I wrote my name in the book of Her Majesty Queen Nazlio ..... s 2 0 At 1700^ Her Majesty held a Levee at the Gulistan Palace which was attended by the Diplomatic Corps and the heads of foreign Naval and Military missions 0 I was accompanied by my Secretary and Flag Lieutenant and we wore full dresso The Levee took place in the Peacock Throne Room, (a beautifully proportioned room containing some magnificent jewelled weapons and in which the wedding presents were on view) and with the many and varied uniforms was a very colourful affairo The members of the Diplomatic Corps and the Naval and Military missions of each country were grouped together and Her Majesty walked to each group in turn, individuals being presented by the head of each missiono At 2000 I attended a dinner given by His Majesty the Shaho This, like all the subsequent dinner parties was very badly organisedo Yfe stood about for over an hour before proceeding in to dinner* and, as one table plan only was provided at the last moment, the scene which ensued was more like a rugger scrum than a state banqueto Only the heads or the foreign military missions and the ambassadors and ministers and their wives attended the dinner* but the junior members of the missions, etc 0 , were invited to the soiree which took ? lace afterwards at 2200 o The dinner and soiree were held n the Gulistan Palace which has a large fore court and gardens, all brilliantly illuminatedo At 2330 a very spectacular firework display was giveno (Dress - Full Dress)o 23rd of ApriloooEnclosure NOe 1 to East Indies letter No e 518 /EoI« 156 of 4/6/39 (Cant’d)o 23rd of Aprilo At 1000 I visited the Royal Naval Guard in their quarters at the Military Academy^ and was very impressed with the comfort in which they were housedo 2o At 1500 we all attended a 'Youth Display' at the Stadium; the latter is about the size of a large football ground with seating accommodation for about 60,000o The Display was on a gigantic scale, lasting some three hours, and was extremely well organised© It opened with a parade and inarch past of 1500 Girl Guides and 1800 Boy Scouts, and the subsequent items were on an equally large scale.* with the exception of an exhibition Association Football match, which lasted for about a quarter of an hour, and an extremely interesting exhibition of ancient Persian gymnastics© The latbv* consisted of very strenuous muscle control and muscle developing exercises, carried out as a ceremonial with songs and verses, somewhat on the lines of the ceremony attending ju-jitsu performances in ^apan 0 (Dress No© 4)© 3© At 2‘JOO* I attended a dinner given by the officers of the Iranian Army at the Officers* Club© The arrangements on this occasion were more chaotic than ever** and the general delays longer; we did not proceed to the Dining Room until 2130* and then took about half an hour to find our g laces at the tables© The proceedings were enlivened owever by the Belgian Minister* who for the celebrations. had been created 'Ambassador with a special mission*© He claimed that his place at table was not commensurate with his new title and dignity.* and he refused to be seated until he was moved to a higher place© Though a large number of additional guests had been invited to a soiree, due to commence at 2200, we did not Join them until 2345 when there was the usual firework display, followed by dancing© (Dress - Bali Dress). 4© On that evening* the men of the Royal Naval Guard and Band and the RoAoF© personnel were entertained by the British community at the Tehran Club© This entertainment was a huge success and from the mens* point of view* one of the high spots of their visit to Tehran© 24th of April© At 1315 I had the honour of lunching with the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice** and at 1700 we all attended a tea party at the Majlis (Houses of Parliament) given by the Iranian Prime Minister© (Dress No©4)o 2 0 That evening* at 2000* I dined at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs© This party was better organised than most and not only was there a table plan* but we were even introduced po our partners before dinner and informed in what order we were to enter© The dinner party was followed by the inevitable soirbe with dancing and the even more inevitable firework display 0 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a new building which had only been completed three days before the party 0 I was ©ooEnclosure No. 1 to East Indies letter No„ 518 /E.1.156 of 4/6/39 (Cont e d).

D35 TFORD anchored off Debai at 0845 on Saturday, lat April, and the Residency Agent came onboard at once closely followed by Shaikhs Said and Juma. Flushed with success, the Shaikh was much more communicative than usual, and at the start of a conversation lasting over an hour he assured me that no harm or loss had come to any British \ subjects during the fighting on the previous two days. He said that everything was now peaceful and M would continue so until doom’*. 3. The settlement of last October’s troubles at Debai had included the institution of a Majlis, but the members had, during their six months of office, made themselves unpopular by feathering their o^n nests instead of carrying out the reforms in the administration of the State for which they had been elected. The swing of popular feeling in his favour had given the Shaikh the backing and a wedding celebration the opportunity to overthrow the Majlis. 4. The immediate situation was not, however, without danger; six ex-members of the Majlis had escaped to Sharjah with about 100 armed men, and it was important to arrange for their dispersal, before further fighting broke out which might have interfered with either the Imperial Airways flying boats or the local Hindu merchants. 5. The Shaikh was given his 5 gun salute and Shaikh Juma his 1 gun on leaving. When I returned the call at 1100 I was met on the beach by the Shaikh surrounded by a large body of armed men. When we reached the Shaikh’s house I was given a chair with 'Welcome” on the seat and we had a further long discussion of the situation. 6 . The Hlitical Agent, Bahrain, arrived by Imperial Airways next day and during the next three days he held a series of discussions with the Shaikhs of Debai and Sharjah to settle the future of the six ex-members of the Majlis. Shaikh Said paid a final visit to the ship on Wednesday, 5th April, and, at the request of the Political Agent, the 5 and 1 gun salutes were again fired on departure. &gt; 7. The situation, having been settled for the time being, we I sailed for Bahrain at 1300 on Wednesday, 5th April, Debai has proved | to be unready for any form of democratic government; what they need is I a strong ruler; under the present Shaikh, recurring trouble is to be | expected.

FOWEY arrived at Ajman at 0735 on Saturday, 18th March and anchored in 3^ fathoms off the town. The Shaikh was prompt in paying his call and was accorded the usual three-gun salute on leaving. His call was returned during the forenoon. 8 . FOWEY left Ajman at 0700 on Sunday, 19th March, and arrived at Hamriyah at 0745. The Shaikh of Hamriyah was extremely prompt in coming off to the ship, and it waa found possible to return his call ashore and sail for Umm al Cuwain at 1010. The latter place was reached at 3.115. The Shaikh of Umm al Quwain was also prompt in calling, and his call, together with the customary three-gun salute, was completed by 1300. I returned his call during the course of the afternoon. 9 . Such little intelligence of affairs on the Trucial Coast as could be gained during these visits has been included in the intelligence report for the month of March. The three Sheikhdoms visited appeared extremely peaceful. 10. FOWEY left Umm al Quwain at 0600 on 20th March, and arrived at Bu Musa at 0935, anchoring in the bay on the 8 .W. side of the island. The headman did not come off to the ship but it was ascertained that Commander Rainer of the Oxide Company had left the island a fortnight previously. 11 . FOWEY left Bu Musa at 2200 on 20th March and proceeded to Khor Kuwai, arriving at the latter place at 0720 on 21st March. H.M.S. BIDEFORD arrived about half an hour later, and from 21st to 23rd March, I remained in company with BIDEFORD at Khor Kuwai. 12 12OONFIDKNTIAL . /v 7 7 ■7' / as 19 ? -Mkj—narai if*'. 12 . FCWiTif left Khor Kuwai in company with H.M.S. BIDEFORD at 2100 on 23rd March. The tvo ships parted company at 0030 on 24th March, and I proceeded to Shinas, which place was reached at 1005 on the same day. No one came off to the ship from 8 hinas but it was afterwards ascertained that the Wali was away at Sohar, the next place visited. 13. FOWEY left Shinas at 0600 on Saturday, 25th March, and arrived at Sohar at 0905. The acting Wali, the son of the proper Wali and himself the Wali of Shinas, came off to pay his respects soon after the ship had anchored, and his call was returned during the forenoon. 14. FOWEY left Sohar at 0600 on Sunday, 26th March, and arrived at Khaburah at 0907. Again the Wali was prompt in visiting the ship, and his call was returned during the forenoon. He also placed camels at the disposal of the officers to enable them to visit the hinterland during the course of the afternoon. 15. Landing along the Batineh Coa7t was not easy on account of the gradually shelving nature of the beaches, and it was difficult in each place visited to get ashore dry shod. Landing, however, was always possible from a skiff, though this was a wet operation in the afternoons when there was a considerable sea breeze. No Dhows were met with at sea on either the Trucial or Batineh Coasts, and in consequence, none were boarded; but some Dhows were visited whilst at anchor. 16. FOWEY left JChaburah at 2200 on 26th March, rendezvoused with BIPRFCRD off Muscat on the morning of the 27th March, and arrived at Muscat at 0855. 1 accompanied the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. BIDEFORD, during his call on II.H. the Sultan, and was present when His Highness returned the call. FOWEY dressed ship overall from 1045 until 1130. 17 17 . From 27th to 30th March, FOWEY remained at Muscat, being in company with H.M.S. BIDKFORD until 2000 on 29th, when the latter ship sailed for Bahrain.CGHF1DEKTIAL. 2 ? Ho. 05. ! R 0 / v* j H.M.S.

On arrival, an officer was sent ashore to the Agency to arrange for the paying and return of official calls. These calls were paid during the forenoon of Wednesday, 19th April, the Political Agent accompanying me when I paid my call on His Highness the Shaikh, and being present onboard when His Highness returned my call. The customary eleven-gun salutes were accorded to H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent on the conclusion of their calls onboard. 7. On Thursday, 20th April, an invitation having been received to be present at an exhibition to be given by the Kuwait Boy Scouts, I attended, accompanied by two of my officers and a number of the ship’s company. The exhibition, scheduled to start at 140Q though actually commencing one hour later, took the form of a display of drill and a sports meeting, and though over lengthy not being completed until nearly 1900, was remarkably well run. The discipline shown by these Arab children was of quite a high order. 8 , Arrangements to dine with the Shaikh and for him to diine onboard, unfortunately had to be cancelled owing to His Highness becoming indisposed; but he had so far recovered by the end of the ship’s stay for myself and two officers to dine with him on the last night. The members of the Shaikh’s family were, however, invited onboard to coffee on the forenoon of V/ednesday, 26th, and apparently enjoyed their visit. The Boy Scouts to the number of 110 also visited the ship and were extremely well behaved, also appearing very interested. x X X X■■BPPQHIPHiHHiHHi COMMUNICATION SHOULD TO- IC StCBtTART rr THE ADMIRALTY LONDON.

At 1630, I accompanied the Political Resident to Shaikh Palace, where the former presented the C.I.E. to Shaik Abdullah Salim - President of the Council of Kuwait. I had been requested to provide a guard for this occasion, but in accordance with K.R. dt A.I., Article 150, this request was refused. An unarmed party of twenty-five ratings from BIDEPORD attended the ceremony. This, I gathered, was very much appreciated by the Politicals. At 1630, I accompanied the Political Representative to witness a War Dance in Jafat Square, given in honour of the above occasion. The setting was very picturesque and I very rajich enjoyed the first fifteen minutes, after which, monotonous repetition continued for another hour. The ratings from BIDEFORD also attended.

Medical attention was given to a small number of natives, daturday. 25th. Arrived As Suwaik. An onshore wind caused a neavy surf, and no communication was made with the shore. At 0900 on Sunday, a representative of the Wall came off and expressed his master s regret at being unable to call on me, owing to a 'severe cold and pains on the chest'. At his request the Medical Officer supplied the necessary cure. I I was satisfied that the Wall was indisposed, and that no disrespect was contemplated.

Both these officials were most affable. Captain Bayendor*s call became somewhat prolonged owing to his boat breaking down after bringing him to the ship, and having to be rescued by an A.l.O.C. launch from mid-stream. His only remark on thie contretemps was 'I have had a lot of trouble with it. It is Italian'. X X X X X 15. - On Tuesday, fcth *lar*h, the Iranian Navy, consisting of the BABH, PALANG and three of the four smaller escort vessels, proceeded down river. The leading Iranian ship paraded a guard and a guard was paraded in VOfftSY and the customary honours exchanged; but none of the Iranian ships appeared to possess a bugle. 16 _ FCWiY left Abadan at 0700 on Thursday, 9th March, 'and proceeded up river to Abadan, the custoaar./ honours being exchanged on passing Khoraiuuahahr# 17 17. - The17. - The ship arrived off /shar at 0930, saluted the Iraq flag with 21 guns, which salute was returned with rather more precision than on the last visit, and secured to No.11 jetty at 1000.

The Shaikh and his supporters came at 1500; the old man was very subdued and willing to accent any solution to the crisis that the Political Jgent advised. On leaving the Shaikh was given his salute of 5 guns and Shaikh Jana his 1 gun. 4. The leaders of the revolt were the AL BU FALASAH, the principal family in the town and of which the Shaikh himself is a member. They arrived nt 1600 and stated their grievances against the present autocratic administration at great length. Their object was to get full powers )for themselves and to administer the shaikhdom through a legislative council. Though they had no idea how a legislative council should worfc, they had probably got this democratic conceotion from the recent formation of a council at Kuwait. The Political Agent told them that Kis Majesty’s Government would continue to deal direct with the Shaikh and advised them to go away and consider a solution by which they and the Shaikh could work together. 17 th Octobe r. 5, The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was in the town in the capacity of mediator and he came off to see the Political Agent on Monday morning. He was unwilling to offer any constructive solution to the trouble. On leaving he was given his 5 gun salute. 6. All Monday the FALASAH had reconsidered their terms with the assistance of the Residency Agent and at 0900 on the Tuesday they arrived back onboard to hand them to the Political Agent, In brief the terns demanded were that Debai should be governed by a council of 15 of themselves nresided over by the Shaikh who would be forced to carry i ijtoo effect majority decision of the council. The Shaikhwas handed these terms in writing at 1500 an^ appeared willing to acept them. On his departure he was given a salute of 5 guns and 1 gunfor Shaikh Juma. 19th October. 7 At 1000 on Vednesday the Shaikh of Debai came onboard...X X X X (S3) 1 onboard at his own request to ask advice about the proposed agreement, he was chiefly concerned about his personal income and allowances, and when reassured on this point was ready to accept the FALASAH’S terms, 8. Both parties ant the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and his followers,a total of more than sixty Arabs, attended a peace conference onboard at 1500 that day; where the leaders 3 hook hands, rubbed noses and signed tteagreement. It was also decided that the first meeting of the ohaikh and his new council should be held next day,. The Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai were each saluted with 5 guns on departure, and Shaikh Juma got his 1 gun. 9. These salutes were in excess of the occasfons laid down in Appendix V of the East Indies Station Order Book but were fired at the request of the Political Agent as it was considered essential to show our continued support of the Shaikh. 10.

In view of the state of His Highness* health it was suggested that he should be asked whether he would prefer to return ray call at the Agency, rather than have the fatigue of returning it onboard the ship. This was accordingly done, and His Highness, having intimated that he would prefer not to corae onboard, he returned ray call at the Agency about 1100, No. salute was therefore fired.

Oebai was reached three-quarters of an hour after sunset, the ship anchoring in 6 fathoms at 1848. 11. The Residency Agent came onboard on arrival and apprisec me of the situation ashore, and ^ arranged with him that the Shaikh should call on the following morning. 12. The Shaikh of Lebai called at 0915 on Sunday, 9th October, and was accorded his usual five-gun salute on departure, I returned his call ashore during the forenoon. The Shaikh was not inclined to be comraunicative about his affairs, but volunteered the information that he did not know why the ship had come. This in contradiction to the Residency Agent’s , statement that the Shaikh had been trying to persuade him to ask the Political Agent to send a ship to Lebai. There is little doubt, however, that the arrival of the ship had a quietening effect on the situation ashore. 13. For the remainder of the period under review the ship remained at anchor off Lebai, The weather was fine, but a heavy swell, which made boatwork somewhat difficult, was experienced on two days.

Weightman, acting Political Resident, that some trouble had broken out in Kuwait and he requested that 'Deptford”, who was at Bahrain, should move up to Khubbar Island so that she might be in a position to go to Kuwait promptly in case of a hostile demonstration. It transpired that the Council had demanded the removal of the Shikh’s Persian Secretary. The Shaikh refused to part with him and the Council being adamant in demanding his removal the Shaikh threatened to abdicate unless the Council yielded. He requested aid from the Political Authorities. 'Deptford' sailed for Khubbar Island on 12th and remained there until 16th when she was ordered to return to Bahrain the trouble having died down.

On 2nd July 3 Bahrain fruit merchants received consignments of fruit from Muscat by the B.I. slow mail w Bankura * and these were duly cleared through the Customs. One basket of limes, however, remained unclaimed and had no maxks on it. It was therefore treated as abandoned cargo and on examination about 2 lbs. of Charas, a Mauser magazine pistol and two clips of cartridges were found. Whether this consignment was actually meant for Bahrain or not remains a mystery, but someone has been unfortunate to the extent of about Rs.2500/—• (P.A. Bahrain). 20.

At the beginning of July he was taken from his residence at Sakhir to one of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s air-cooled houses which the company were kind enough to put at his disposal. He has now left Bahrain for a holiday in Kashmir. (P.A.Bahrain A H.M.S.'Deptford'). suns** X x x- OIL. 24* Material and equipment for the Californian standard Oil Company is pouring through Bahrain en route to Damman, Has Tanurah and Abu Hadriyah* About 1600 tons went through in the last week of July* (P.A.

(B.M.A. Tehran). 26. Basrah x-etroleum Company - On 29th July a new concession was signed by the acting Minister of Kcono.aics and Communications and the representative of the Basrah Petroleum Company in respect of oil prospecting rights over the whole of southern Iraq, including the Basrah valayet and extending to the Iraqi-saudi Arabian frontier. ^s the Basrah Petroleum Company is an offshoot of the X.P.C. and the latter have also acquired the controlling interest over the B.O.D. Company’s original concession over areas west of the Tigris this now means that the I.P.C. has virtually obtained complete control of the known and potential oil resources of Iraq and a right to their subsequent exploitation on a royalty basis. It is understood that the payment of this new concession will be i?'r. 200,000 (gold) per year. (R.A.F. Intelligence dumoary). . i. o. . 27. There is a certain amount of trouble in the A1 Thain family of v^atar. The Shaikh complains that some of his relatives have been encouraged by the Shaikh of Bahrain to come across to Banrain where they are given money for the purpose of spreading hostile propaganda in Qatar. On the other hand the relatives have complained to the Political Agent Bahrain that the Shaikh refuses to give them any share of the money he receives from Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., and that as their other sources of income have now disappeared they have nothing to live on. The Shaikh of atar has ignored a suggestion that it is not only incumbent on him but it is also in his own interests to make provision for his poorer relatives. (P.A. Bahrain). 28 28. It is later reported that while declining the advice of the Political Agent that he should make provision for his poorer relatives, the Shaikh has expressed the hope that the Political Agent will expel those members of the A1 Thain family oresent residing in Bahrain. /HeI He has been informed finally that as he will not accept the advice offered to him, the Political Agent is unable to assist him in the manner which he desires. (P.A.Bahrain). TRUCIAL COAST. 29* Debai, - With reference to paragraph 9 of the Persian Gulf Intelligence report for July, owing to a tendency on the part of tne Shaifch to go back on his promises, there is still discontent in his State. During a visit to the Political Resident at Bahrain it was impressed on him that it was in his own interests tc keep his subjects satisfied by introducing necessary reforms in his Sheikhdom. (P.A.Bahrain). BATING COAST. Pirates. - With reference to paragraph 11 of the Persian Gulf Intelligence report for July, while at Khor Jarama on 27th August, two Bedouins volunteered the information that the pirate Chakir bin Murad had gone to Baraimi (Baraimi is a somewhat notorious Oasis situated about 24° 30* N, 55° 30* E. The ownershijp of this Oasis is divided between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia and very little control is-exercised over it by Cither bwheT). In view of the trouble that has been taken to attempt to bring this man to justice, it was considered that this information was worth confirming. Accordingly H.M.S. ’’Shoreham” made a call at As Suwaik on passage from Khor Jarama to Elphinstone Inlet. The Wall was sent for on arrival and as on the previous visit denied all knowledge of Chakir but it was subsequently ascertained from the local Customs officer that Chakir had left ior an unknown destination inland, together with his family and bodyguard shortly after 'Shoreham's' visit on 18th July. The attitude of the Wali serves to confirm the previous suspicion that he has a hand in the game. This matter has been reported to the Political Authorities. (S.HD.Persian Gulf). MUSCAT. S1 * Cables. - The cables of Cables &amp; Wireless Ltd., leading into Muscat were reported to have been completely broken on 4th July. The R.A.F. Authorities have given permission for the Political Agent to use the R.A.F.W/T Station for his official telegrams. (P.A.Muscat)* 32. His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman returned from his world tour on 13th July. He was greeted with a 31 gun salute on his arrival fired from the Sultan s battery and the state Buildings were decorated and illuminated for tr^ree days in honour of the occasion. (P.A.Muscat)• /33. Captain33. Captain A.C. Byard, Commandant Muscat Levies, vacated hie appointment on 31st July and has proceeded to the United Kingdom. The command of the Levies has been taken over by Subedar Khan, a pensioner from the Indian Army. The Sultan has declared t!iat for the present at any rate he does not intend to ask for the services of another British Officer for this appointment. Captain Byard has held this appointment for nearly three years and has brought the corpos to a high state of efficiency. (P.A.Muecat)• 34. The Sultan has also replaced his second secretary, Saiyid Hilal bin Badr, Oy one A.li Mohammed Jaaali. (BA.Muscat). x X X38. With reference to Persian Navy movements for July, it is now reported that (1) the Tug Neru proceeded to Bunder Shapur on 8th July and returned to Khorramshahr on 15th. (2) H.I.M.S. w Palan&amp; ,, reported as leaving for Bunder Shapur on 12th July proceeded to Bunder Shapur for docking, and (3) the Chahrock on her return to Khorramshahr from Bushire on 5th July brought a captured dhow with her. She is also reported as having captured 2 dhows near Muriad and 2 near Bushire all of which were turned over to the Customs Authorities. (V/C Khorramshahr A Brit.Con.Bushire}13 (Jl) I Extract s from the Persian Gulf Intelligence Report for July. 1958. * X X XX 4. Kuwait Arras Sams,,link. With reference to paragraph 4 of the April Persian Guxf Intelligence report and paragraph 10 of the same report for May, further information has now come to hand. The situation is as follows:- There is no doubt that a large number of arms are finding their way into Iraq and that these arms come from Saudi Arabia. One report states that it lias been incontrovertibly proved that arms are being moved from Kedj northward. The Kuwait authorities state that there is no such smuggling from Kuwait and further that no one in Kuwait from the Shaikh downwards derives profit from a trade in arms passing through Kuwait territory. /TheM i R.A.F. authorities on the other hand report four different cases of large quantities of arms and ammunition having arrived in Iraq and in each case the source of their information stated categorically that these arms had passed through Kuwait territory. The greatest import of arms into Arabia takes place at Jedda and other places on the Red Sea coast where there is no British control of arms as in the Persian Gulf. A glance at the map makes it hard to see why these arms should come through Kuwait at all. Summing Up. There is no traffic in arms from Kuwait into Iraq. There appears to be a brisk trade in arras from Saudi Arabia into Iraq. R.A.P. Authorities state that these arms pass through Kuwait territory. ThePolitical Authorities maintain that (c) is not the case* (a) 0&gt;) (c) (d) (S.N.O. Persian Gulf) KUWAIT. 5* Kuwait has been suffering from an attack of infantile democracy* Better communications, the Radio and the Advent of an Oil Company are the causes. At the request of most of the notables and with advice from British Official quarters H.H. The Shaikh has agreed to permit a council to advise him. This council consists of Shaikh Abdulla as Salim as Subah, C.I.K. and fourteen members selected by the heads of 150 families. (P.A.Kuwait.) BUSHIRE. 6* The Iranian Gunboat Shahrokh is reported as having intercepted two dhows during the month of June. These dhows were brought into Bushire and handed over to the Customs Authorities. (Brt*Consul Bushire). 7* Conscription. The Conscription office, Bushire, which had been amalgamated with the Kaval Bureau, has been separated and transferred to a new office rented for it. The conscription committee has notified the local youths who are due for service to report themselves in July when recruiting will begin. The Committee has been instructed to send local recruits to the Military Barracks, Bushire, instead of to the Iranian Navy at Khorramshahr. .A (Brit.Consul Bushire). 8. It is rumoured that the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company are negotiating, or are intending to negotiate, with Abn Saud to waive the clause in their concessions requiring them to construct a refinery in Saudi-Arabia. (P.A. Bahrain). /TRUCIAL COAST./(2) TRUCIAL CQaST ir Debai, With reference to paragraph 21 second part of my June Intelligence report. The Shaikh, yielding to the influence of his wife and son, attempted hut failed to effect a settlement and temperatures began to rise. A further demand for fixed allowances in favour of his cousins was ignored and the latter then proceeded to formulate a series of demands including the following:- fl) A budget and civil list. ( 2 ) A watch and ward service. (3) Reorganisation of the Customs department. (4) Proper arrangements for health and sanitation in the town. (5) Fixed allowances for members of the Ruling family. (6) Abolition of monopolies held by the Shaikh, his wife and son in respect of landing cargoes from ships - ferries - mo^or services etc^ Each side then began to collect their forces. A truce however was arranged and after lengthy negotiations, in which the Residency Agent, Sharjah, played a prominent part, a reconciliation was effected. The Shaikh agreed to abolish monopolies and promised reforms in the Customs and other services shortly. He also promised to consider the question of fixed allowances for his relatives. At one stage it seemed as if negotiations would break down, owing to the interference of the Shaikh of Ras-al- Khaimah. He was however sent home by the Political Agent Bahrain with a reminder of what had occurred after his inter vention in the Kalba affairs. BATINEH COAST. Sohar. The Wali of the village of Fasqah near Sohar is reported to have been killed by some men of the Bani Kalban tribe on 28th June. The offenders are still at large. (P.A.Muscat). 11• As Suwalk. With reference to paragraph 21 of the April P.G. Intelligence report concerning the pirate Chakir oin Murad - and paragraph 7 of my July report of proceedings. During 'Shoreham's' visit to As Suwaik it was evident that (1) Shaikh Hilal bin Ahmed of the Baadi tribe who lives at Batta (3 miles S.W. of Suwaik) is hand in glove with Chaikir bin /urad in both slave trading and piracy ventures and is sheltering him.nio (5Q ( 2 ) That the Wall is either afraid to take action against them or is in league with them himself (The wall’s salary is reported as being Re.300 per annum). | this merely confirms previous information. The Political Resident has had an interview with the H.H. The Sultan of Muscat in which he attempted to persuade him to take action against Chakir by means of his levies, who could be transported by one of H.M. Sloops. The Sultan however said that he preferred to try and take action against him with his tribes. Thus an apparent dead lock has been reached and it appears that the offender will be allowed by the authorities to proceed with his nefarious occupation at any rate for the present. (S.h.O.

Fish trftpa &gt; The fish traps to the westirar ’ of the naval pier had been erected this year closer to the pier than formerly and it was feared that unless action was taken to stop this encroachment trouble would ensue. Accordingly on 5th July a meeting was held with the owners and the Superintendent Land (apartment, Bahrain, in which a boundary was fixed. This boundary has been marked with stakes and the owners have been told that they are not to approach nearer to the pier. No compensation was necessary. Fatal /ccident at Bahrain . On 6th July a fast motor boat owned by the Bahrain Oil Company was reported ka overdue on passage from their oilfields in Saudi Arabia to Bahrain. A search was immediately organised by the Political Afyent and a request was sent to the Air Officer Commanding for a flying boat to assist. The boot contained three Kuropeans as well as the Arab crew. After some delay one of the Europeans was found still alive but badly burnt as the boat had exploded. The other two were ricked up dead the next day. x x X X On pass »ge to Khor Kuwal it was the intention to spend daylight hours on the pearl banks off Abu Dhabi to obtain an idea of the measure of success that might be expected in an operation against a pearling fleet.

The Residency Agent came on board on arrival and arranged for the Shaikh’s call. Shaikh Juma was sick. On the return call, alter coffee, the matter of the renewal of the civil air agreement was broached. (Reference paragraph 14 of P. O.I.R. for Larch, 1938). As had been expected, the Shaikh’s objection to the renewal was not brought up and it merely became a matter of price which could only be settled after he had consulted his ilajlie. Arrangements were therefore made for him to meet the Political Agent on the 6th June at Sharjah. 4. SHOREHAli left Debai at 0600 on 2nd and arrived at Khor Kuwai at 1600 the sarae day. Unfortunately the Political Agent was called back to Bahrain and SHORfHAM sailed at 2200 on 4th June for Unau al ^awain and AJman in order that the Political Agent might visit these Shaikhs before catching the Air Mail early on 7th at Sharjah. 6. Sharjah was reached at 0816 on 6th and calls were exchanged with the Shaikh after which a visit was made to the Imperial Airways rest house. The Political Agent waa disembarfced at 1630 in order to meet the Shaikh of Debai after which he spent the night at the rest house. SHORKKAM sailed at 2000 after embarking a raan charged with slave trading who was to be tried at Bahrain. 7. 8K0RKHAM arrived at Kalba at 1 16 on 7th. The Shaikh called very promptly and was shown around the ship. The minor Shaikh accompanied him.18./ On the return call the matter of the two pirates Chakir bin Lurad and Shar L urad was broached. The Shaikh had a great deal of ueeful information to give about the former and promised to assist in the arrest of the latter should he be sufficiently ill advised to return to Diba. This information has been forwarded to the Political Resident and the Political AgB&amp;t, Bahrain. It was stated that there had been no cases of piracy on the coast since the naval ships had started their patrol. 8. SHORKHAH left Kalba at 0600 on 8th June. It was decided to carry out an examination of the coast on passage to Khor Kuwai in order to show the ship to the local villagers and to examine any places in which it might be possible for a pirate to lie up. With this intent a khor to the north or Diba Bay was visited in the Barge. The local villagers stated that no dhow ever took shelter in this khor which was scarcely surprising considering their appearance and the fact that they belonged to the warlike Shihouh tribe. Various other khors were inspected from the ship and no dhows were seen in them. Two dhows were visited but not searched and one dhow was questioned from the ship. 9. It was learnt for the first time that quite a number of small Jallibauts visited this coast in the pearling season to dive close inshore for pearls. lost of these dhows come from Diba but a few come from Hen jam and the Persian coast. 10. SHOREHAil arrived at Khor Kuwai at 1715 on 8th June and went alongside the oil barge. 16 tons of fuel were discharged into the barge and the supply of water was increased to 25 tons. Two dhows were boarded on Friday, 10th, one of which was a pearler from Henjam and the other a dhow carrying passengers from Diba to Has al Khaimah. 8H0REHAM sailed for Bahrain at 2115 on 10th. 11. On arrival at Bahrain at 0845 on 12th June the prisoner was landed in charge of the Agency Parash. On Monday 13th and Tuesday 14th the annual inspection of BIDEPORD was carried out and SHOREHAM sailed for Abadaa at 0530 on 15th. 12. Arrival at Abadan was made at 1130 on 16th June. The Iranian officer of the guard called on arrival and arranged that the calls with Colonel Bayendor and the Govei^nor should take place during the dogwatches in view of the heat. This was accordingly carried out and the usual cordial relations prevailed. 16. SHQR&amp;HAfc sailed from Abadan at 0700 on 24th and arrived at Basrah at 1000 on the same day. A salute to the country was fired on passing Aahar. Official calls were not exchanged. 17 17. At 0600 on 27th the tienior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf, and Staff Officer (0) flew to Habbaniya to hold a conference with the Air Officer Commanding B ritish Forces in Iraq on the subject of forthcoming exercises.

No hangars have as yet been constructed. (R.A.F. Intelligence Summary.) 5. Railways. The date of the comoletion of the Trans- [ranian line was generally expected to be August of this year; aut owing to unexpected objections raised by the Russian government over the matter of importation of railway material /ia the Caspian Sea it is unlikely that the line will somoleted before November 1938.

(S.N.O. ,P.G's No. 134/522 of 18th July 1938J. _ ^7 &amp; ?• There have been many storms in the Political tea cup lately involving accusations of bribery and other quarrels. The Prime Minister has done his best to preserve the peace and retain his cabinet intact b|ct even he was not able to prevent the Minister of Economics and Communications, Jalal Baban, from resigning over a question of financial compensation for a road making contractor. Hi a place has been taken by the Finance Minister who has assumed the additional port folio of Economics and Communications. During this minor crisis the King showed no desire to retain the Madfa*i Government in power and he was quick to show that the recent activities of the Prime Minister to curb the Royal Prerogative had forfeited him the Royal favour. It is interesting to note that the cabinet is at present left without its customary Kurdish member, but this owing to the strong pan Arab sentiments at present prevailing in the country and to the fact that Kurds have no love for Valaj's* attitude towards Kurdish Nationalism, has yet raised no unfavourable comment. (R.A.F. Intelligence Summary.) GOVERNOR OF KHORRAMSHAHR A ABADAN . 8. It has now been officially announced the Agha Farzaneh is Farmandar of the Khorramshahr ’Shahristan* and that the Bakhshdars of Khorramshahr, Abadan, Shadegan, Gusba and Hindi jam are subordinate to him. Agha Farzaneh is now living in a house lent by the A. 1.0. C. in Khorramshahr and the old office is now occupied by the Amniyeh Department. (V. C. Khorramshahr.) 9. Contraband. 26,000 Rials worth of smuggled articles have been found in the house of the accountant of the finance department, Khorramshahr. The matter is under investigation. (V.C.Khorrarashahr.) IRAN . 10. Bushire . On 16th May the Persian Gun Boat * Shahrokh f seized two dhows carrying 39 persons, 300 heads of sheep and cattle, 200 carpets, Rials 20,000 in notes and a Kerosene tin full of silver coinsand handed the whole over to the customs authorities. When interrogated at the law court at Bushire, the men declared that the high handed treatment meted out by the road guards and military authorities in Dashi hud decided them to emigrate to the Arab side of the Gulf. This report is stated not to be an exaggeration as it might at first appear t0 t&gt;e * (P.R. BUSHIRE). 11. Wheat Crop. This years wheat crop in the Bushire district is estimated as sufficient for Bushire and its districts. (P- 8 * Bushire.) 12 12. Dr. Ble^ a d...n 6?) PERSIAN OJLP INTELLIGENCE REPORT - JUNE 1938 (S.

It is reported that Dr. Blegrad is proceeding to Denmark shortly at the end of his contract with the Iranian Government. He is reported to have expressed much satisfaction at the canning prospects on the Iranian side of the Bulf. His scheme is that two factories should be started, one at Bushire for fillets, and one at Bandar Abbas for delicacies such as anchovies, sardines, langousts etc. He thinks that the Bushire factory should be in operation before the Bandar Abbas factory is started. However before much could be done the fishing industry would need re-organising and it is thought that the indigenous fishermen may cause difficulties. (P.R. Bushire. ) OIL. is. Kuwait . No. 2 Well of the Kuwait Oil Company, having as already reported, produced oil of good quality and pressure and been taken into use for fuel by the company, work has commenced on No.3 Well. This Well is situated l£ miles E.N.E. of No.2 Well (whish is at Burgan} 30 miles south of Kuwait). It is assumed that No.3 Well will give results by about October. (P.A. Kuwait.) KUWAIT . 14. Aftermath of the IKHWAN Revolt . Shaikh Mutlaq as Sur of the Mutair has received the King of Saudi-Arabia*s pardon and invitation to return to him. He left Kuwait for Riyadh on 23rd May after eight years exile. (P.A. Kuwait. ) 15. Tribal Taxes in Kuwait , In addition to large numbers of Saudi tribesmen in Iraq and in the Saudi-Iraq neutral zone there is a large number camped in the Kuwait-Saudi neutral zone and in northern Kuwait territory. In accordance with Arab custom it would be proper for the Shaikh of Kuwait to collect from them Zikka, the poll tax which is sanctioned by the Qoran. Before doing so, however, and as a matter of courtesy, H.H. the Ruler of Kuwait has asked the Saudi trade agent in Kuwait to remind the King that the Zikka is due, and due to the Shaikh of Kuwait. This will give the King an opportunity of withdrawing his tribes iiariediately if he wishes, although it is in fact almost too late in the year for them to move. (P.A. Kuwait.) 16. Shaikh of Kuwaiti Personal Standard. The Shaikh of Kuwait has taken into use a personal standard. It consists of the Kuwait flag with a representation of his camel brand in white in the right upper canton. The camel brand consists of a vertical line with shorter straight lines radiating from its centre towards the fly (like half a star). He flies his standard on his residence, the Secretariat, yacht and car. (P.A. Kuwait.) 17 17. Saudi Arabia. • •PERSIAN GULP INTELLIGENCE REPORT - JUNE, 1938. (S.N. 0., P.

I?* It is reported that the Bahrain boats and launches which went to A1 Khobar for the purpose of taking stores, sand etc. for the use of the oil company there have been turned back by the Saudi authorities who say that they do not want foreigners to do that sort of work in their territory. The Saudi authorities took similar steps two years ago. As there are insufficient Saudi boats for the work in progress the oil company is in some diffidulty, but it is hoped that an arrangement will be reached shortly. Meanwhile intense activity continues at Damman and rapid development of the oil field there is to be expected, (P.A. Bahrain). 18, Aviation . The French Government has presented the Asudi Government with a new Caudron Renault low wing raonpplane with seats for four persons. It was delivered at Jedda on April 17th. The sum allotted during the current Moslem year for aviation is Francs 27,000. (R.A.F.Intelligence Summary.) -a tar. 19. The Shaikh of Qatar has agreed to exempt all Royal Air Force fuel stocked at Dohah from payment of Customs dues. ABU DHABI . 20. With reference to paragraph 16 of the P. G. Intelligence Report for May 1938. The Political Resident has now asked for permission to inform the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as follows (a) that ffom information in his possession there was no doubt that slave trading went on in the Shaikh’s state contrary to his treaty engagements with us. v b) that as a security against the continuance of this trading the Shaikh should pay to H. M’s Government the sum of Rs. 8,000/- which sum would be returned to him by annual instalments of R8.2,0C0/- if the Political Resident is satisfied that slave trading has ceased. (c) that if this sum is not paid up wtthin 14 days that his fort will be borabar ded. The original intention had been to seize his pearling fleet instead of (c) but the operation was found to be one of considerable magnitude under the prevailing circumatances and was dropped in favour of bombardment.

The proposals for the reorganisation of Iraqi’s diplomatic representation in certain European Countries laade by the Foreign Minister, Towfig as Smwaidi, on his return from Geneva last October are now to be carried into effect. The Office of the permanent Representative of the leagie of Nations has already been abolished. The Legations in London and Paris are being combined under the Minister in London and the Iraqui Legation in Berlin will shortly come under the control of the Minister in Rome. It is hoped that these innovations will effect oonsiuerable economy, bit the practicability of such a scheme still remains to be seen. It is interesting to note moreover that in making these amalgamations Iraq has achieved a nicety of balance between Fascism and democracy. (R.A.F. Intelligence Summary). 4. Army The fourteen Italian tanks bought by the Iraq army have now all been rendered serviceable and five of these recently carried out a demonstration on easy ground. The tanks which were well driven, operated satisfactorily but have several technical faults:- ( 3 ) (4) The tracks are very narrow. Accommodation is exceedingly cramped, there being practically no head clearance. The guns e^ect their empty cases over the driver who is inadequately screened. The guns have only a 10° traverse. Owing to (4) and the difficulty of obtainirg Italian ammunition it is hoped to replace them by Bren guns with modified mountings which will increase the traverse to 40°. (R.A.F. Intelligence Summary) Anti Aircraft Guns. It recently came to light that the Iraq Army have purchased a number of anti Aircraft Guns from Germany. These purchases were made during Bekr Sidqui's regime and without reference to the British Government. The military Authorities state that the guns purchased number eighteen and that they are to be mounted on motor lorries. (R*A.F. Intelligence Summary) 6. Air Force.

(Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf). TRUCIAL COAST. 13. Abu DHabi . As a result of slave trading in his territories, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has lostfbr the present the good Offices of His Majesty's Government. This involves the stoppage of travel papers for himself and his subjects. (P.A. Bahrain.) DiSBAl. 1 14. On the 27th February the Political Resident visited Debai in H.M.J. BIDiSFORD. During his visit he asked the Shaikh to depofct two residents who, according to reliable information, were trading in arms. The bhaikh agreed to do this, on the 14th March however serious agitation began at Debai (a) Against the deportation of the two indiviuuals. (b) Against the manumission of slaves (there has been a increase in the numbers in the last four months) with apparently some fear that manumission on a large scale amounting to a general emancipation/was intended. The Residency Agent reported that it was (b) which was the real issue and that this had aroused much feeling. 'Bideford was despatched to Debai and took a letter to the shaikft reminding him of his responsibility for the protection of British lives and property,..(&amp;&gt; and property and especially that of Imperial Airways, The situation then improved, the presence of the Escort vessel had a quietening effect, and'Bideford' was able to sail on 18th March. A warning was sent to the Debai residents to keep the peace and a notice was sent to the Trucial Shaikhs to the effecl that there was no intention of wholesale manumission of slaves. The Majlis of .Debai then passed two resolutions (1) To ask the Political Resident to arrange for the return of their slaves. (8 l ) To ask the Political Resident to pardon the two gunrunners failing which the Shaikh should not renew his air commercial agreement without having first consulted his people. The Political Resident did not see his way to pardon the gunrunners seeing that it would only be taken as a sign of weakness. / On 24th March Mr. H.Weightraan, the acting Political Resident Persian Gulf in Sir T. Powle’s absence, flew to Debai and thrashed the matter out with the Majlis. The slave questior was settled satisfactorily as was the inatter oftthe two gunrunners, but the Majlis stated that they did not wish the Shaikh to renew the civil air agreement. The Acting Political Resiaent states that he considers that there is a certain amount of T Pacesaving f about this and that after a couple of months or so the negotiations for the renewal of the agreement may well be successful.

With reference to paragraph 13 of the February Persian Gulf Intelligence Report and my 0549 of 9th March. 'Powey' arrived at Muscat art 16th March and preparations were completed for embarking the Sultan’s Representative and the Muscat Levies. 'Fowey' remained at Muscat until 26th when she sailed for Bahrain, it having been reported that Pastori was still in Baghdad and showed no signs of moving. On 31st March A.H.Q., Iraq, reported that Pastori was moving to Basrah by train and on the 4th April that he had left Basrah for Mohammerah by car. Arrangements were made to have him watched at Mohammerah. However on 6th April a further signal was received from A.H.Q., that Pastori was still in Baghdad and it was evident that they had been trailing the wrong man at Mohammerah. This was borne out by a letter receive by the Bahrain Customs from Pastori which bore the Baghdad post mark dated 5th April and which enquired about his rifles*. A draft copy of his agreement has been received and the following articles are of interest:- Article VIII - The company has the right to enter the said territory arms, ammunitions, and any kind of armaments necessary for the protection of the company. Article....rzfc Art icle IX - The Company undertakes through her Government to protect the Shaikh from invasions or foreign attacks to the limit of her power.

Insufficient quantities have it worth while putting it on the (P.A. Kuwait)8* ITALIAN BROADCASTS. On 25th January Italy broadcasted a description of Kuwait and her ruler* The modern town, alongside the old, was described in detail, as was Kuwait’s municipality, the gardens and parks, the up to date buildings, the perfection of its climate and the excellence of the arrangements made for visitors, so that listeners must have thought that there is really very little to choose between Kuwait and Monte Carlo* In short Kuwait was described as if all the scheme for its improvement and progress ever thought of had now materialised, and as if it were always winter and high tide* This description, together with the ^straight news” broadcast in Arabic from London has done much to discredit wireless information from Italy. (P*A* Kuwait). BAHRAIN. 9; A storm of protest was raised in ’Le Journal de Tehran’ when an article appeared in the paper ’world Petroleum’ describing the opening of the Bahrain Oil Refinery* The part of the article objected to was tt&gt; the effect that Bahrain was an independent State governed by H*H* the Shaikh who had concluded treaties with Oreat Britain* This ended with an announcement in ’Le Journal de Tehran’ that the Iranian Oovernrnent had protested to the British Government on this matter. (Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf). TRUCIAL COAST . 10* Captain Galloway Acting Political Agent Bahrain accompanied Dr* Storm of the Bahrain American Mission to the trucial coast at the end of January to visit a much respected and influential friend of the Shaikh of Debai who was in the last stages of tuberculosis* Permission to visit the Trucial coast was given as the Shaikh of Debai urgently requested that he might be allowed to go. This visit serves to emphasise the urgent need for establishing some form of medical unit of our own on the Trucial coast, this being necessary not only for Political reasons but also because of the fast increasing contacts between the coast and the outer world. (P.A. Bahrain)* JAPANESE BROADCAST . 11* Reports have appeared in several Iraqi papers to the effect that the Japanese intend to start an Arabic broadcast from Tokio* (R.A.F.Intelligence Summary). PIRACY ON BATINEH COAST* 12. With reference to S.N.O,, P.G’s report of proceedings for January 1938 paragraph 15. According to reliable information, the person responsible for the recent piratical activities off the Batineh coast and the east coast of the Mussendam Peninsula is one Chakar Bin Murad, a Boluchi, who has lately been residing at Suwaiq (Batineh Coast). He has with him in his jolly boat (about 35 feet in length) some II armed men and his method is to shelter during the day in one of the many small harbours and proceed to sea and attack dhows at night* The Muscat Government have been requested to make every effort to apprehend him. PASTORI• 13. On 1st March a message was received from the Political Resident that an Italian named Pastori (who is a well known character in Iraq and who was, amongst other activities, at the bottom of the scheme for settling Assyrians in Abyssinia) was * trying01 &lt;m&gt; to gain concesaions with certain of the Shaikhs on the Trucial and Muscat coasts, amongst them ^as-al-Khaimah and Dibe* To further his plan he was reliably reported to be about to attempt to land machine guns and ammunition at Diba, a small place on the east coast of the Mussendam Peninsula and in Muscat territory* With a view to stopping his activities if he should attempt this scheme arrangements have been made for H.M.S. FOWEY to proceed to Muscat with a view to embarking a detachment of Muscat Levies and proceeding to Diba where the Levies would be landed in time to arrest Pastori on his arrival, on a charge of gun running* Pastori whose movements are being closely watchedj is at present in Baghdad and is expected to leave for Diba very shortly# Oil was not mentioned in the proposed Concessions which were for exploit of Minerals and construction of Aerodromes, Post Offices, harbours and W/T# Also importation of armaments of all kinds* (Senior Naval Officer , Persian Gulf).

The Wall of Khassab was at Khor Kuwai in his dhow on the way to Khumzar where he was going to spend the Ids. He called on me unofficially on the 4th February. On the same day his dhow dragged on to a lee shore during a strong Shamal. It was eventually towed to BIDEFORD and secured astern until the next day when the weather moderated. 3. During the same Shamal a small Persian Dhow ran into Khor Kuwai having jettisoned their cargo and food. They claimed to have no money to buy food at Khassab and after verifying as much of their story as possible by sending an Officer on borrd to examine their papers, I made an issue of rice and bread to enable them to reach Sharjah where they had agents. 4. On the 8th February, at 0600, I sailed for Bu Musa arriving there at 1355. Course was set down the Trucial • • • • • CoastCoast with the object of searching dhows in accordance with Senior Naval Officer^, Persian Gulf, No.503 dated 13th December, 1937, but none were found.

At 1000 the narkoda of a small Muscat dhow came on board and reported that at about 2000 on the 23rd January he had been stopped and boarded by about 15 armed men from a small dhow off Limah. He stated he had been robbed of 300 rupees and a bag of rice. He thought, by their language, that the men were from Baluchistan. 13. I reported the fact by signal to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who instructed me to proceed with all despatch to the vicinity of Limah and search all dhows, taking the narkoda with me. 14. I slipped at 1215 and on my way to Limah searched 4 dhows but found nothing of interest.15. As there were no more dhows in sight and darkness was approaching I proceeded to Limah and anchored there at 1800 for the night. 16. I weighed again at 0600 the following morning and proceeded back to Khor Kuwai. On the way back I searched 2 more dhows but they were both employed on legitimate business. 17. I arrived Khor Kuwai at 1030 went alongside the oil barges, embarked 123.9 tons of fuel and sailed at 1630 with No. 1 oil barge in tow. 18.

Numerous articles, all inaccurate and many without even a basis of truth, purporting to describe events in the Persian Gulf, have been appearing in the Iraqi Press. Come of the writers refer to the Persian Gulf as the Gulf of Basrah anu their general trend is to herald political changes anu the loosening of existing ties in the Gulf. Hitherto such articles have been occasional. In the last few weeks only, they have been frequent. Most of them have appeased in A1 Bilad, a Baghdau newspaper. (P.A. Kuwait) 9. As Sijil, newspaper of Basrah, published on 24th December an attack on the Saudi Arabian Government. In this article Ibn Saud is attacked for refusing to allow a conference at Mecca on matters affecting all Islam, and for refusing either to protest to the British against their action in Palestine or to send his armies to fight them. The writer is the son of the former Municipal director of Kuwait who has been educated in Baghdad. His name is Khalid Sulaiman ai Atsani. (P.A. Kuwait) Egypt . An £g ptian paper called al MirabAtal Arabiya is specialising in articles calculated to undermine Britain* s repute in Arabia proper and on its seaboard. The aoministration or representation in Aden, Hadhramant and the Persian Gulf have all beon repeatedly attacked in recent issues. Surprising changes are fereostotin the Persian Gulf. The iiditor of this paper is obviously anxious to secure a Foreign circulation in that special rates are quoted for iiadhramant and Singapore while free copies have been reeeiwsd in Kuwait. The Editor of tnis paper is the rather well known writer Amin v»aied and the office is at 22 Bharia in Nowab, Cairo. (P»A. Kuwait) 11. Political Agent, Kuwait, reports that ’'taking stock of the state of general relations at the end of the year, a year during which there has been trouble in some neighbouring countries, anti from some of which there has been totued a stream of anti-British newspaper propaganda, it is remarkable how excellent relations remain'. \ /HJBARAHZUBARAK . 12. It is reported that the Arair of Hasa recently wrote to the 3heikh of Qatar informing him that the absconding Naira tribesmen who came to Bahrain after the Zubarah incident and are now in Saudi Arabia had approached him to obtain permission for them to go to Qatar to collect their cattle and other belongings which they had left at Zttbarah when they set out for Bahrain.

With reference to paragraph 8 of b-fiPTFORD* s Letter of Proceedings for 15-31 October, 1937 forwarded as an enclosure to S.N.O.P.G’s Report of Proceedings for November, 1937. The outcome of this affair was a somewhat inadequate letter of regret to the Residency Agent at Sharjah and the Political Resident consequently stopped the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah’s travel permits until such time as he saw fit to address a formal letter of apology to the b.N.O.I.G. It is now reported that the Sheikh has been considerably inconvenienceu by thia action and that in consequence was unable to make the ”Haji u to Mecca with his son and family. BATINNH C0A;T . 15. Disturbances have broken out in the Bani Kaab tribe, whose headquarters are at Mahdha, a village some forty ralfes west of Sohar. The cause of the disturbances is the rivalry between the ex Shaikh’s son and his ’uncle for the control of the tribe. This rivalry has existed since Sheikh Salim bin Diyain died, some two years ago and the enmity between the two has increased until in the middle of December it broke into open hostilities. Later reports state that the district is in a very disturbed and unsettled condition. (P.A. Muscat) M USCAT . 16. Italian Interest in the Gulf .

It is understood that the reply given to this request was that permission for a visit could only be given by the Sultan who was absent abroad. The Sultan’s Representative stated that the object in giving this reply was to stop the visit. No further information regarding this matter has been received to date. j18. . Trucial Coast .

IRAQ . 5* Reference paragraph 1 of the Persian Gulf Intelligence Renort for October, during November the Government became suddenly alarmed at the spread of Communism in the country and imagining that they had discovered a strong communistic group in the army, proceeded to arrest some seventy men, mostly non-commissioned officers and mostly from the station at Qaragham# This combined with the arrest of three cadets of Iranian origin accused of sending reports to Iran of the recent manoeuvres at Qaragham, only serves to confirm the unsettled atmosphere of suspicion and distrust which still prevails# Their fears respecting communism are almost without foundation as true communism hardly exists at present in Iraq and it is extremely doubtful if anyone in the country, including the members of the Cabinet, have a clear understanding of what communism really is or what its principles are# (R*A#F. Int* Summary^ 6 . • • . . • i if int '6# Assyrians in Iraq * Reference paragraph 96 f the Persian Gulf Intelligence Report for October, an Italian syndicate, the Vasselli Company of Rome, with interests in Abyssinia, has been occupied for some time in gaining contact with the more prominent Assyrians in Baghdad and Hinaidi with the idea of settling Assyrians on the land in Abyssinia. It is reported that the Iraq Government view with favour the removal of as many Assyrians as possible from Iraq# The terras offered appear to be attractive to the Assyrians, but there has been some unfavourable comment among them on the fact that there is no mention of nationality in the proposals submitted to the Foreign Minister* The Assyrians generally distrust the Italians but many of them are anxious to leave Iraq and may therefore be prepared to give this scheme a trial# (R.A.F. Int* Summary)* 7* Four Power Eastern Pact . It is reported that the representatives of the signatories of the Four Power Eastern Pact (Saadabad Pact) Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan are meking arrangements to hold their first meeting in Kabul early in 1938* It is probable that the Chiefs of the General Staffs of these countries will also attend this meeting# (R.A.F. Int. Summary). 8. Japanese Trade in Iraq . A new decree, which came into force immediately, was issued on 31st October under which Japan must in future take Iraqi products up to 35# of her own goods cleared in Iraq instead of the previous 25## This decree creates great difficulties for the Japanese traders who have little use for Iraqi products. Seven members of a Japanese commercial delegation arrived in Baghdad on 5th November to discuss all questions concerning the trade between the two countries with the Government. (R.A.F. Int. Summary). 9. Baghdad-Haifa Road * In Iraq this road, for parts of which the British Government sanctioned an expenditure of £200,000, has now reached a point forty miles west of Ramadi between which point and Baghdad it has been surfaced and is passable in all weathers. This road is primarily for military traffic at all seasons, capable of carrying 3 ton lorries with a capacity of 150 lorries a day# v \ V (R.A.F. Int• Nummary). KUWAIT . • \ 10# Some indignation has been caused locally, and it is rumoured to Ibn Saud also, that the Transjordan Desert Police appear to be using Nejd and Kuwait as a recruiting field* The latest information is that the young Sheikh Mutlaq ad Duwish, a cousin of the young Mutairi chief Mukharib bin Duwish has received a letter from the British Officer of the Police, who he has never met, encouraging him to go to Transjordan. H.H. The Sheikh of Kuwait is endeavouring to dissuade any more of the young Sheikhs from going to ’’join up” although the pay and presents offered are attractive to them# (P#A* Kuwait)# SAUDI ARABIA * 11. It is understood, from various quarters, that there still are rumours, afterwards maliciously exaggerated, that the Saudi Arabian tribes have invaded, or were about to invade neighbouring territories# AccordingAccording to information in Kuwait it seems clear that The King has no intention of allowing his tribes to invade Trans Jordan, nor can or will they do so without his sanction and aid. However in view of all these frequent stories, it may be worth while pointing out that in addition to his annual gathering of the Sheikhs and leading clansmen in the summer at Riyadh, which annually gives rise to rumours of mobilization, His Majesty, according to local information, frequently sees fit when approached by tribesmen for permission to raid or go to war, to put them off w until after*' and then follows whatever is the approaching event or period which seems inconvenient for fighting. This has always been assumed here to be obviously and merely His Majesty’s way of putting off some of his more importunate subjects who very likely know that this will be His Majesty’s reply but get the kudos for having shown courage and gainsaid the ninth chapter of the Koran, about which the desert Arabs are very touchy. Filtering out of Arabia, these sort of replies by the King to some of his subjects are apparently seized upon in certain quarters as a sure indication of hostile intentions, whereas in fact it is the exact opposite, (P,A. Kuwait), 12. Saudi Arabian Air Force . It is reported that the Saudi Air Force is to be re-organised into two squadrons, one of Wapitis and the other of the Italian aircraft. (R.A.F.

On 18th November a subject of the Sheikh of Sharjah delivered a speech in a mosque at Debai on the subject of Palestine, He is said to have accused the British of humiliating the Muslims and helping the Jews end appealed to the Muslims on the Trucial Coast to subscribe towards the relief of the poor and helpless people of Palestine, He is said to have collected Rs.280.

Referenea paragraph 21 of Persian Gulf Intel igence Report fbr September, the new Government have taken steps to ensure that the Array shall not remain a political force in the country. Some fifty officers have been weeded out, all of them known supporters of the late Chief of the General Staff, and the armed forces have been forbidden to take an astive part in politics. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 2. The League of Nations has now publicly announced with regrets, its inability to provide for the settlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq, and has requested the Iraq Government to assist in settling them in Iraq as part of the Iraq people. As this had been foreseen by the majority, the announcement has been calmly received. (R.A.F. Int.Rpt) BASRAH 3. Reference Persian Gulf Intelligence Report for July 1937, paragraph 1, all four of these gunboats have now arrived. The first two have been put into commissi n and are at Amara. (S.N.O.P.G.) KHURRAMSHAHR. 4. At the beginning of October a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture arrived in Khorramshahr to make enquiries into the possibility of finding a market for Teheran coal in the Gulf. At a meeting to which he invited all the managers of foreign shipping concerns in Khorramshahr and at which he produced samples of Teheran coal, he offered Gray Mackenzie a sample ton which is to be sent to Bombay for examination. It is believed that his visit was the outcome of a report submitted by the Captain of a Greek ship to the effect that a codling station for British India ships had been established at Bahrain. The report stated that the Bahrain coal was of pfor quality. (Vice Consul Khorramshahr). It is assumed that this refers to the recent sale oj Admiralty coal at Bahrain. (S.N.O.P.G). KUWAIT 5. Air mail service for Kuwait. During the first fortnight in October the land machines of the main eastbound and westbound services of Imperial Airways were replaced by flying boats. These boats do not call at Kuwait. Duplicate eastbound and westbound services call at Kuwait as usual. (Kuwait Int. Report). 6. Sauu.i Arabia. Ibn Baud moved into camp at Hamah Wells on 6th October and proposes to remain there till 1st November. Ramah, wijich is at the junction of the Kuwait and Hasa car tracks, is a usual camping ground for the King and His family at this time of year. (Kuwait Int.

Haiti* On 11th October eight camels belonging to the Skeikh of Kuwait were raided from their grazing ground at Aluan Naim in the Dibdibba, ten miles west of the Shaqq. As no Kuwaiti would dare to steal the Ruler f s camels, it is assumed that the raiders came from across the border. The camels are all branded with the Sheikh’s brand. 13 • Transjordan. Ajirai bin Suwait, Sheikh of the Lhafii* arrived at Kuwait on the 15th October from Transjordania. He has reported that all is quiet in Transjordan and that there is n ) tribal movement whhtever. This has usefully discounted the Italian broadcast from Rome on 12th, 13th and 14th October given out as 'from Cairo' that the Wahhabi army had advanced into Transjordan, and that *.r. Philby had been sent by the British Government to persuade Ibn Saud to restrain his men. On 13th the 'Transjordan Army' wt^s reportafl as aefeated and in retreat before the Wahhabis. 9. Kuwait Local Interests. A raid by Iraq police thirty miSea into Kuwait territory took place on the afternoon of 15th October.

While proceading on a visit to the Trucial Coast H.M.3. DSPTPORD culled at Sharjah on lath October, 1937 and enquired from the Residency Agent whether he had inforraed the Sheikhs of his intended visits. The Residency Agent confirmed that he hau informed them and stated that all of them would be in their towns with the exception of the Sheikh of Ajman who had gone inland before news of the visit had reached him, On arrival at Ras al Khaimah at 1500 on 19th October DiSPTFORD was met by the Sheikh’s brother who said that the Sheikh had gone hawking and that he might be away for a week or more, and that it was not possible to communicate with him quickly. The Commanding Officer H.M.S. DBPTFORD formed the opinion that the Sheikh had gone away deliberately and in consequence did not give the Sheikh’s brother a gun salute. The mdter has been reported to the Political Resident and Political Agent, Bahrain, who have taken the laatter up.

He took with him presents of camels, ten for the Amir of Hasa and eighteen for the Kin_. It is rumoured that the object of his visit is to ask the King to prevent certain tribesmen living on the borders of Abu Dhabi from joining the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the event of hostilities breaking out betweenDebai and Abu Dhabi. There appears to be little foundation for this rumour. (Bahrain Int. Report). 16.

I passed tnia news on to thw representatives of Hodeida, who were greatly concerned, and frequently pointed out that 'the eyes of all Moslems were directed towards the action of Great Britain in Palestine', rather as though this feature had been missed by our authorities! in the BARI in August was a great success, for much ' , Bak8heesh ,, was distributed around the town to all and sundry. It seems probable triat the visit of WESTON will not be so historical as there was no 'free issue' in this respect. It was informed, with considerable pride, of the fact that King Yaha, who is over 70 years of age, had recently acquired another wife ( *den Political Intelligence Summary No.561, par.6831, refers). It is open to conjecture whether this is an indication of the King’s rejuvenation, and with it the maintenance of the existing status quo in the country, or alternatively whether the demise of the King may not be somewhat hastened, in which event, from all accounts, the country will be plunged into a state of warring factions, each making a bid for the Imamate; the Wazir of Hodeida is considered to be a strong favourite. x x X 3.

FOWEY left Bahrain at 0630 on Friday, 3rd September, and anchored off Sharjah at 1130 on Saturday, 4th September. The Residency Agent called on board and was followed by the Shaikh of Sharjah; the latter was saluted with 6 guns on his departure. Both these calls were returned by me between 1700 and 1300. I also paid a visit to the Imperial Airways Rest House, where I met the Superintendent, Mr. Cole. 4. Sharjah was left at 0700 on Sunday, 5th September, and the ship anchored off Abu Dhabi at 1600 the same day. The Shaikh called at 1700 and was saluted with 5 gans on leaving and I returned his caiy&amp;t 1745. 5. Departjre from Abu Dhabi was made at 0700 on Monday, 6th September, and FOWEY arrived at Oebai at 1600 the same day. Shortly after anchoring, an Arab was seen to be swimming towards the ship from a pearling dhow, under way, about seven cables off. He was brought on board and interrogated by me. He was wearing ankle irons and stated that he had a very bad ear and the owner of the pearling dhow was trying to force him to go diving. He • •••••HZ He had been a slave but his master had recently died and he was now on his own. The Medical Officer confirmed the fact that he was medically unfit for diving. He was eventually handed over to Shaikh Juma t who said he would be responsible for him and he agreed that he was not in a fit state to dive. Shaikh Said bin Maktum accompanied by Shaikh Juma called at 1700; they were accorded salutes of 5 guns and 1 gun respectively on leaving. I returned the call shortly afterwards. 6. Debai was left at 0700 on Tuesday, 7th September, and AJman was reached at 0830 the same day. Shaikh Rashid called at 0900 and was saluted with 3 guns on leaving. I returned his call at 1630. 7. Departure from Ajman was made at 0700 on Wednesday, 8th September, and Umm al ^awain was reached at 0830 the same day. The Shaikh called at 0915 and was accorded a salute of 3 guns on leaving. I returned the call at 1630 and the ship sailed for Khor Kuwai at 2100 the same day. X X X X 10. F0W3Y left Khor Kuwai at 1000 on Friday, 10th September, and arrived Muscat at 0700 the following day. It had previously been arranged that I should pay a formal call on His Highness the Sultan at 1015 but I received a signal on passage to Muscat asking that the call should be an informal one. I subsequently learnt that this was on account of the unexpected arrival in Muscat of the heads of some tribes from the interior, with whom the Sultan wished to discuss, before leaving for Sur the following day. In consequence of this, no return call was made by His Highness and the times of arrival and departure on Sunday were merely settled. On enquiring how many would be accompanying His Highness to bur, he informed me that the party would consist of 40, including Captain Byard and 14 Muscat Levies. 11. Hie Highness and Captain Byard embarked in FOWEY’s motor boat at 0815 on Sunday, 12th September, the remainder having embarked just earlier in local boats. His Highness was received with a Subaltern's Ouard and his standard was broken on his arrival on board. The ship sailed at 0900 and anchored off Sur at 1640 the same day dressing ship overall on anchoring. The Wali of Sur came onboard to call on the Sultan; the troops and others were disembarked in local dhows and His Highness, Captain Byard. and the wali disembarked in FOWSY’s motor boat at 1750. A Subaltern’s guard was paraded on the departure of His Highness and a salute of 21 guns fired on his leaving the ship, the ship being undressed at sunset, about 20 minutes later. x X X Xr iM (WW INTSLi-I (teteMtelKfaf 1 * AbooST 1937, Senior Haral cer, Persian Gulf’s No,262/522 ;^eptemper, IVW.

An article appeared in 'Le Journal de Teheran*' on 15th August criticising a report on the econoraical and commercial situation of the Persian Gulf. The part of the Report which ”Le Journal'* objected to states that the Bahrain Islands are under the rule of an nrah Shaikh who has concluded Treaties with the Governments of Great Britain and India, and that his relations with these Governments are friendly. The 'Le Journal'* states that they consider the author should be informed that the Imperial Government of Iran conserves the rights of the sovereignty over the Islands of Bahrain and has never recognised the Government of the Shaikh or the goodwill of his Treaties with Great Britain and India. (S.M.O.P.G.) 6. Property held by Persians . An order has been issued in Iran that no person from Bahrain is to be allowed to hold property in Iran. H.H. The Shaikh of Bahrain countered by issuing a similar order in connection with Iranians living in Bahrain.

There is no foundation for this story. The Mutair, most of whom are in Saudi Arabia and a few in Kuwait, are not in the least likely to move towards Palestine. The fact that it is 1050 milee distance (or one month by camel) the summer weather and water conditions and the Government control of the markets where they must re-stock in October and November, coupled with past experiences, make this move impossible at least for this summer or autumn.

Some surprise has been felt that Hikmat Suleiman, whose feelings towards the pan-Arab cause has heretofore been luke warm, should have posed as such a strong champion of the Palestinian Arabs; but the Palestine Report gave him an excellent opportunity of ingratiating himself with the Arab population here who have been inclined to feel that the present Government has up to the present shown itself unsympathetic towards them. Having made this gesture, it is thought that Hikmat Suleiman has no wish to be further embroiled in the Palestine dispute, and is unlikely to live up to the standard which he has set by his outspoken opposition to British policy in Palestine.

The Political Resident (Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle) arrived at Bahrain from Buahire on 15th August en route to England on leave, Mr. 0. K. Caroe also arrived at Bahrain on 15th August to take over teiporarily the duties of Political Resident. Calls were paid by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and the opportunity was taken to discuss with the Political Resident the practicability of establishing a recreational base at Kuwait. A separate report has been made on this subject. x s * 11. With reference to paragraph 10 of the July Report of Proceedings, the question of the number of guns to be accorded to the Governor of Buahire has been settled for the time being. He has been told to submit his application for more guns to Tehran for consideration. Presumably if the Iranian Government see any justification for an increase in his salute, they will take the matter up through diplomatic channels. Meanwhile it is agreed that he only receives his usual salute of 13 guns. xxx 11. Ii conversation with the Sheilfc and Mr. Belgrave the following points arose:- Palestine Partition Scheme Mr. Belgrave stated that the Sheitfitakes little interest in the Palestine Partition Scheme. On receipt of the Foreign Office telegram the SSH-elkh said to him 'There are 8000 Jews in Palestine are there not?' Property held by Non-Nationals . Mr. Belgrave informed me that recently the Persians issued Qn order thfct no p rson from Bahrain is to be allowed to hold property in Persia. The Sheilfc countered by issuing a similar orde in connection with Persians living in Bahrain. T ere is a number of Persians living in Bahrain and the Sheikh’s order has caused annoyance to the Persian Government who are proposing to bring the matter before the League of Nations.

The first two of the four river gunboats ordered by the Iraq Government arrived on 4th August, 1937. The particulars of these vessels are as follows Length 100 ft. Loaded draught 3 ft. Beam 17 ft. Speed 12 knots Armament One 3.7' Howitzer Two Trench Mortars Pour Vickers Machine Guns Built by Thornycroft. They are protected by bullet proof plating throughout. The next two are expected in September. (S.N.O.P.G.) Bahrain . 3. Further to paragraph 4 of my June Intelligence Report, between two and three hundred tribesmen from the smaller tribes such as the Bu Khmara, have crossed over to Bahrain. H.H. The Sheikh of Bahrain has decided that, in view of recent events in Catar, he was not disposed to continue the transit due privilege which he had previously extended to the Sheikh of Qatar. This means that from the date of this Proclamation cargo in transit for Qatar will be required to pay the usual duty. Further, H.H. The Ruler of Bahrain has prohibited the entrance of Qatar subjects into Bahrain. 4. The following amounts of oil have been embarked into tankers during the period 15th June to 15th July:- HENNING MACRAK Danish 14 ,430 tons THORSHAVN Norwegian 6,000 BELITA »» 9,920 LUCIFERO Italian 5,940 MARIT Norwegian 7,680 NACOMA Dutch 11,070 OGURA MARU Japanese 10,800 A7HELTSMPLAR British 13,000 Total 78,840 tons (P.A. Bahrain). Kuwait. 5. Reactions to _ih§_ Palestine Commission^ Report . The reactions to the Royal Commission's Report were very mild in Kuwait. The man in the street still knows nothing about it. The very limited literate and wealthy class took more interest, and fastening on to the word 'partition', protested to the Sheikh and appealed to him to send telegrams of protest to the authorities concerned. His Highness did send off some non-committal telegrams to the Supreme Muslim Council, the King of Iraq, and the King of Saudi Arabia, and also transmitted his views to the British Government quarters.\ nh As seems to have been foreseen, a milder view of w partition ,, as a solution is now being taken than after the first day of publication. The news published in the wireless that Ibn Saud^ message in reply to the Supreme Muslim Council had been more non-committal than others, had a good effect here, where in such matters he is the arbiter of public opinion. The pronouncement of Hikmat Sulaiman, Prime Minister of Iraq, that anyone who accepted the headship of the Arab state would incur the anger of the Arab world has had a mixed reception, rather more bad than good. The TSmir Abdulla is not popular but he is an Arab unlike Hikmat Sulaiman, and he is accepted as a descendant of the prophet, so that some caustic comments were made locally about Hikmat f s authority to speak. (P.A. Kuwait) 6. Kuwait Oil Company . An attack on the Oil Company and the Ruler of Kuwait appeared in the Iraqi newspaper 'As Sijil” on 6th July. The gist seemed to be that the Oil Company were not trying to find oil, that by drilling at Sabahiya (where they are not and do not yet intend to drill) which is claimed by Ibn Saud (which it is not) they indicate that they are playing a ’deep and bad game', and the Ruler, b' not consulting his people, is much to be criticised. The Ruler of Kuwait has been co-operating with the Saudi tax-gatherers to stop nomads from evasion of taxes. (P.A. Kuwait) Saudi Arabia . 7. Reports are reaching Kuwait of raids by the Bani Hajir on the Abl Murra with rather disturbing results on general security. The Harb and the other great tribes some weeks ago showed signs of restlessness which was not decreased by a belated rumour, due to his delay in the Hedjaz in the Spring, that the King was dying or seriously ill. The King’s return and activity has restored this situation. 8. Comment . Among the tribal people more and more is heard of the revolt which will take place in Nejd if Ibn Saud should weaken or die. It is often said that a pact exists between the three tribes, the Ajman, the Mutair and the Ataiba, that they will take concerted action as soon as opportunity offers. (p.a. Kuwait) Bushire . 9. On 8th June Colonel Bayendor arrived from Shiraz and left in the Gunboat KARKAS the following day for Khorramshahr. Before his departure he inspected the Plashing Light and promised to send a naval officer from Khorramshahr to test it and take it over on behalf of the Iranian Navy. 10. During the first week in June the Recruiting Officer, Bushire, posted a notice warning 300 youths of Bushire due for military service to report themselves in December, 1937, January, 1938. 30 conscripts recruited in Dilbar joined up at the Military Barracks. (P.R. Bushire) • Bprazjun . It is reported that 400 conscripts having been sent to the Recruiting Officer, managed to evade service by bribing him. 12 12. The road guards having been found super corrupt and0 v V too inefficient to prevent smuggling, the Iranian Government have commissioned their Navy to do this work. The Naval Authorities have, therefore, taken steps to station some 150 sailors in the ports between Khorramshahr and Bushire. (P.R. Bushire) 13. The Iranian W/T Station. Bushire , has been completed and is awaiting tests. It is not known when it will begin to function. (P.R. Bushire) l 4 * Visiting Ships . News has been received, in June, that only shipping agents, passport and quarantine officials might visit ships in Persian waters. This recent sign of Persian ingenuity in inventing restrictions not only causes a certain amount of hardship in Bushire, but restricts the legitimate movements of Consular Officers. The matter has been reported to His Majesty’s Minister. (P.R. Bushire) Khorramshahr . 15. 105 persons have been recruited between 15th and 30th June. 50 of these are undergoing training in the Naval Barracks, Khorramshahr, the remainder were sent to Ahwaz for training by the Military Authorities. Abadan . 16. It is understood that the A.I.O.C. have obtained a contract to supply a certain amount of oil to the French Navy at Toulon. (S.N.O.P.G.) On the 4th July the French Oiler LE MEKON arrived at Abadan, having given the normal notice for a merchant tanker, and having started to load was stopped by the Persian Authorities on the grounds that she was a warship. She mount: two guns and is manned by naval ratings. Permission to continue loading was granted on 7th July and she sailed with a full cargo on 8th July. The French Oiler LE LOING arrived 27th and sailed 29th after fuelling. (Vice Consul, Khorramshahr.) 17. Colonel Bayendor’s power locally seems to be on the • up grade, and he has now been granted the privilege of receiving the call from Commanding Officers of visiting ships before the Governor. This procedure is, however, only provisional at the moment. (S.N.C.P.G.) Iraq . 18. The political situation has not been improved by the Cabinet crisis. The hot weather may keep people quiet for the next few months, but it seems more than likely that there will be further political upsets in the not distant future. Opposition to the Government is widespread in the Middle Euphrates and reports from Mosul, as well as from the southern Liwas, indicate that those antagonistic to the present regime are becoming more active and increasing in numbers. The split in the Army between Bekr Sidqi’s adherents and his opponents appears to be coming more acute; and the presence in bordering countries of Nuri as 8a’id and other banished leaders who are anxious to see a change in Government, is also a disturbing factor. ouch a combination of circumstances cannot make foi political tranquillity and might even lead to changes as drastic as those of last October. (Iraq Int. Jummary — JurV 0‘ \ (Wi) 19. Since this report, news has been received that Bekr Sidqi and Mohammed Ali Jowad have been assassinated; the details are not yet known. (8.N.O.P.G.) 20. lurchase of Italian Aircraft . It is now definite that Mohammed Ali Jowad has placed orders for both twin and single engined Italian aircraft. ?ive ^avoia bomber transport, and fifteen Breda single seater fighters have been ordered and earnest money to the amount of 120,000 Dinars has been despatched to Italy. Delivery is to be completed by the end of September. Considerable doubt has been expressed by some of the more senior Iraqi pilots as to the advisability of taking these new aircraft into service. They foresee a further increase in the maintenance difficulties which are being experienced owing to the shortage of skilled tradesmen. Furthermore they realise that the majority of their pilots are most inexperienced and have hardly reached the stage where they can be trusted with high performance fighters or with heavily loaded twin engined bombers. Comment in other quarters is mildly congratulatory with an admixture of envy for the substantial financial gains which those responsible for the deal are universally reputed to have gained for themselves. 21.

LETTER OF P RO CEEDINGS, 1ST - 15TH JULY 1937 . * *, * x Jt BnHRnlN 2. On the 2nd July I was informed by the Political Agent that fighting had taken place in the ^atar peninsular, causing casualties which weie already arriving on the island, and that considerable excitement existed in the town. In these circumstances he asked me to cancel my sailing to Kuwait and remain at Bahrain in case of emergencies. I immediately agreed to this and informed the Senior Naval Officer by signal. 3. It appeared that, following fruitless negotiations between representatives of the Sheikhs of Bahrain and ^atar and the headmen of the Naim tribe, an attack had been delivered on the latter by the forces of the Sheikh of *atar. 4L At 2115 I was ordered by signal to proceed to Doha forthwith, and sailed at 2300. 5. My instructions, which were to stand by to protect the lives of British subjects and to obtain any information concerning the situation followed later. Before leaving I found out from the Political Agent that, in the absence of further orders, our attitude was one of non-intervention. 6. After making Halul Island we anchored in Doha at 1130. DOHA . 7. I sent the interpreter ashore on arrival who returned with the news that the Sheikh and all his entourage were at the North End of the Peninsular. The town was quiet and the guard consisted of 50 Bedouins from the interior. One Bin Salim had been left in charge, and I went to see him at 1700. He was friendly, but uncommunicative on th^bubject of the fighting. I explained that our visit was for the purpose of protecting British subjects in.the event of any major disturbance in the town and learnt that only one lived there. I also assured him that our views on the situation were quite impartial. 8. Efforts to get information the next day were not much more successful chiefly because very little appeared to be coining through. The Indian subject, a barber from Baluchistan, was interviewed and told to come to us for protection if the town was attacked but he did not think tfyis would be possible as he had considerable local marital commitments and would probably not be allowed to leave. 9. On the next day news was received by launch that the Naim tribe had surrendaed more or less without a struggle, and in the......2ffT&gt; 2 the afternoon orders were received to return to Bahrain. Political Resident, the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, during our stay. 10. We arrived at Bahrain at 0700 on tne 6th followed by the Senior Naval Officer in 'SHORaHAM' at 1030.

His Highness the Sultan arrived in Karachi on 27th June and on the 29th an official demonstration of British i Field guns was given for his benefit, in the hope that he might order some British guns as he is supposed to favour those of American manufacture. He is proceeding to Kashmir and it is reported that he is contemplating a trip up the Persian Gulf on his return in mid-August. (FOWEY Int. Report). 2. It is reported that a serious fight took place in the town of Sur between the Ghayalin and Arama tribes last month over a question of irrigation rights. A number of men on both sides were wounded. The Wali finally managed to persuade the parties to suspend hostilities pending a reference to the Sultan. (Muscat Int. Report). Kalba . 3. In continuation of paragraph 2 of the May Int. Report. A telegram was received from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, on 18th June, stating that there was a certain amount of confusion in Ras al Khaimah and that the town was cut off from the remainder of the Trucial Coast by land owing to Bedouin activities. This was followed by a further telegram which reported that the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had g gone to Kalba with the idea of taking control of the ShaikhdomJ the opportunity having presented itself owing to the death of i the old Shaikh and the minority of his successor, his son Hamad. He had, however, got into difficulties and finding that he could not get back, had sent a message to the Political Resident saying that he thought a sloop should be sent to prevent trouble in Kalba. Actually he had so annoyed Khalid, the ex-Shaikh of Sharjah and Mohammed bin Ali, the leader of the Beni Kitab tribe, that they had turned the Bedouins on to raid the outskirts of Ras al Khaimah and also cut communi cations in order to prevent the Shaikh from getting home. SHOREHAM took the Residency Agent to Ras al Khaimah, where he proceeded ashore to investigate. On return he stated that all was quiet inside the town but raids were continuing on the outlying parts. The ship then proceeded to Kalba arriving at 0600 on 21st June. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah came off immediately and was interviewed by the Senior Naval Officer. He explained that he had done a good service to H.M. Government by sending for a ship, but was quite unable to say why it was that the trouble had only arisen since his arrival. In accordance with the instructions issued by the Political Resident, he was informed that he would be detained onboard and taken to Bahrain to give a personal explanation to the Political Agent as to why he had interfered in the affairs of Kalba, when he had been expressly instructed not to do so. The Residency Agent then went ashore to report on the situation and collect the Ras al Khaimah followers. He succeeded in getting hold of ten out of the twelve men that the Sheikh had brought with him and brought them off to the ship, where they also were detained. The remaining two men were absent from the town in charge of the camels. It appears that when the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah arrived in Kalba he endeavoured to obtain the signatures of the local inhabitants to a document stating that they wished? Vf him to act as Regent until the boy Hamad came of age. A few had signed this document, but the more important members of the tribe had absented themselves to Muscat and Khor Fakkan. Indeed the Sheikh even attempted to send ashore a further note to the same effect before the ship left Kalba; this was, how ever, intercepted and retained. After the return of the Residency Agent onboard, the ship proceeded for Sharjah where the Residency Agent and nine of the followers were disembarked at daylight on the 22nd, The followers finding themselves very unpopular in Sharjah, returned by boat that night to Ras al Khaimah. The Sheikh and his personal attendant were handed over to the Political Agent, Bahrain, on SHOREHAM’s arrival there on 23rd June. They were duly detained and the Sheikh was interviewed by the Political Agent on 26th June. On 27th June he was allowed to return to Sharjah by air at his own expense. At the end of the month he was still at Sharjah but was expected to return to Ras al Khaimah very shortly. As soon as the Sheikh was removed from Kalba all Bedouin activities ceased. There is little doubt that the summary treatment of the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah will have an excellent effect on the Trucial coast in general where the full story has been officially promulgated. The Residency Agent has since visited Kalba and reports that the people are prepared to accept the slave Barut as the Regent and the only faction still intriguing with the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah are the Naq biyin. Providing there is no more outside interference, it would therefore appear that there will be peace in Kalba. (S.N.O.P.G.) Zubarah. 4. With reference to paragraph 3 of the May Intelligence Report, at the end of June negotiations finally broke down. The Sheikh of Qatar, alleging that the Naim had broken the peace, attacked them with 7000 of his armed followers. The Naim put up a very poor fight and after a small number of casualties had been sustained by both sides, they surrendered. The Sheikh of Qatar has ordered them to surrender their arms and told them that they are free to remain in Qatar under his rule or evacuate to Bahrain. At present there are no signs of them wishing to leave Qatar. H.M.S. DEPTFORD went to Doha with orders to ensure the safety of British subjects. There, however, turned out to be only one, a Baluchi barber, who stated that even in the event of trouble his wife would not allow him to leave. Actually there was no trouble though at first the visit of DEPTFORD was viewed with suspicion by the notables as they would not believe that a sloop would be sent merely to protect one barber and they thought H.M. Government were not remaining entirely neutral. The Sheikh and notables in Bahrain think that H.M. Government let them down by preventing them sending armed forces to the assistance of the Naim, though in point of fact the Sheikh of Qatar outwitted them by the speed with which he defeated the Naim. They are also very incensed that the Naim should have put up such a poor fight and now show no inclination to emigrate to Bahrain. Though Zubarah is a poor place in itself having only a ruined mud fort and some indifferent wells, it is of considerable • • • •?*r I considerable sentimental value to the Khalifah family as it was from there that they came over and took Bahrain Island, Prom that point of view it may be regarded as their native heath. All the Bahrain pearling dhows were recalled in case of trouble, but now all is quiet they will be sent back to the banks. They have utilised this period to refit and restore, which is normally carried out once during the diving season. No further trouble is anticipated and there were no disturbances in Bahrain. (8.N.O.P.G.) Kuwait . 5. Pearl Market . The price of pearls is again descending7~ Just before the Coronation the demand raised the price by 40$ and took all the reserve of pearls out of Kuwait, as well as increasing the number of vessels which went out this season. The leading merchants are pessimistic about the prices that they will obtain in October. Looking forward, however, to 1938 they hope that the Durbar will have a good effect on the market in that year. (Kuwait Int. Report) Iraq . 6. Munitions Scandal . With reference to paragraph 6 of the May Intelligence Report, it now appears that the Premier was rather hasty in recalling Amir Zaid, as when the Counsellor to the Legation in Berlin was arraigned before the Court in Baghdad there was no acceptable evidence forthcoming and he was released on bail. Amir Zaid has since been exonerated and is being allowed to return to Berlin. (R.A.F. Int. Report) 7. Iran - Iraq Frontier Negotiations . With reference to paragraph 7 of May Intelligence Report, according to statements in the Press this Treaty has now been signed. No copy of the Treaty has so far been received, but it is reported that the Iranians accepted the final amendments proposed by Iraq. (S.N.O.P.O.) 6. Re-armarnent . With reference to paragraph 8 of the May Intelligence Report, Mohammed All Jowad has been offered a number of Caproni Bomber Transport Aircraft by the Italians foi immediate delivery and at a low cost. As the Iraq Air Force has an insufficient number of trained mechanics to maintain even the aircraft at present on charge, it seems somewhat lacking in common sense to contemplate the acquisition of a new type. (R.A.F. Int. Report) 9. Middle Euphrates Disturbances . These have been less serious than in former years and have only amounted to attacks on police posts, though the railway line had to be strongly picketed to keep down snipers, and trains had to pass through the Diwaniyah - Nasiriyah stretch in daylight. The Government took immediate action arresting the three leading sheikhs and locking them up in Northern Iraq. The Prime Minister resisted Bekr Sidqi's suggestion that they should be executed out of hand. 7 ; y' I The Military Operations have been confined v t6 a few small skirmishes and a certain amount of bombing of the villages. \ &gt; IT \ V\ ; These measures have had a salutary effect, but at the same time secure conditions have not yet been restored; the railway remains heavily guarded and neither the military nor the police can move freely at any distance from theii* bases on the railway without the risk of becoming involved in ^ fight.

The Municipal Authorities have made a contract with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to supply thrown of Abadan with electric light and water on payment of Rials 400,000. The work is now in progress. (Khorramshahr Int. Report) 11. Import of Motor Cars . There is a rumour in Khorramshahr that the Sherkat Markazi is to be abolished. It is said that they hare lost over 13 million Rials. They have now stopped importing any more cars. It is reported that they are trying to arrange with the former agents of American cars and lorries, viz,, Lavi &amp; Co., Kazadema and Salim A Co., to import cars and lorries as usual but to pay to the Sherkat a commission of 6a. This arrangement has not been accepted by the aforesaid firms. (Khorramshahr Int. Report) 12. Navy Movements . Ship Arrive Place Leave .

The naval authorities warned foreign shipping agents that none of their employees are pennitted to board steamers unless printed permits are obtained from the Naval and the Customs Authorities. Permanent Permits for one year are now being issued by the Naval and Customs Authorities on payment of Rials 5 - 20.

The latter, who is described on one of his passports as a geologist, announced that the object of his visit was to recruit labourers for Sritrea. Tnis was reported to the Sultan who refused to countenance any such idea, and Pastori left again for Bunder Abbas on 21st April. It has since transpired that he was travelling with two passports as the one produced at Bunder Abbas in no way agreed with the one produced at Muscat. Meanwhile the Count, who is a naturalised American subject, [ though of mixed Polish and Hungarian origin, endeavoured to get permission to visit the interior of Muscat and Oman ostensibly representing an American Archaeological Society. The Sultan,however, who was incensed at not having received any advance information of the expedition, refused to grant him an interview or to let him proceed into the interior. He and his wife, therefore, left for Bahrain on 29th April. Though the Count appeared to be a genuine archaeologist there are strong grounds for believing that both he and Pastori were really connected with Italian Oil interests, this belief is substantiated by a report from Aden where their activities had given rise to similar suspicions.

With reference to paragraph 2 of last month's Intelligence Report, the situation is by no means settled and two of the Sheikh of Qatar*s relatives have broken away from him and settled in Bahrain. Further attempts at negotiations have so far failed and the Bazaar is full of the most warlike rumours. It is, however, probable that the advent of the hot weather will damp the enthusiasm of the more bellicose elements at any rate for a few months. (S.HeO.P.O.) HAS TANURAH . 4.

This unexpected , has aroused considerable comment and has not been well receive . A further misfortune to the royal interests is the fact that the Amir Zaid, the traffic as Iraqi Minister at Berlin, embroiled in the illicit traffic in riunitions scandal. Vihen it was revealed that the Iraqi Counsellor in Berlin had involved himself in schemes for the supply of arms to the belligerents in Spain, the /uir ^aid returned to Baghdad and has been kept more or less under detention ever since. It is not at present known there any evidence of the Amir’s complicity in these suady transactions, but public opinion has immediately jumpeu to ti.e conclusion that he has been participating in them, hie shares in the profits are freely quoted at varying, but in all cases substantial, amounts. During the past year the Iraqi public have been treated to a series of scandals in royal clfclee and these further incidents cannot but have an undesirable effect on the royal household’s prestige. ^ ^ t.,?. ) 7. Iran-Iraq Frontier Secrotiations. In order to reserve the right to peso through the anchorage area to be ceded to Iran, Iraq has inserted a section of the original Turco— Persian treaty and a condition of the new arrangement will be that it does not prejudice privileges previously enjoyed. Privileges previously enjoyed” naturally include the free passage of British ships whether naval or^mercantile. 8. Re-armament . Whilst British firms have been able to respond to Iraq 1 s demands in the way of new aircraft, they have not been able to do so in the case of military equipment such as tanks and modern artillery. Mohammed All Jawad, the Director of the Iraq Air Force, has therefore been sent on a tour of the armament producing countries of Surope to obtain quotations. It is clear that Bekr Sidqi does not intend postponing his re-armament programme until British supplies become available. (R.A.F. I.R.) Floods. Considerable floods of both the Tigris and Suphrates occurred during April, the area to the East of Baghdad was flooded and it became necessary to breach the right bank of the Euphrates below Ramadi to allow the surplus water to flow into the Habbaniyah depression. It was fully realised that if floods were experienced in the Middle Euphrates area for the third year in succession, the already disturbedmm- Zif Fago 5 disturbed ai?ea would be considerably aggravated and trouble would probably ensue# Sane good has cone out of the crisis as the Government is now seriously considering the immediate undertaking of the Habbaniyah Escape Scheme.

The Residency Agent came on board on arrival, he informed me that the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah was then at Sharjah and seemed disinclined to return to Ras al Khaimah for my visit. He also stated that in his opinion it was improbable that 'BIDi^ORD 1 S” return to Umm al Qaiwain to complete the survey would be welcomed by the Sheikh and it would probably be necessary to bring pressure to bear on him. At 1430 The Sheikh of Sharjah called on / board and was accorded his salute of 5 guns on leaving. I returned his call accompanied by the Residency Agent at 1630 and found the Sheikh of ^as al Khaimah present. The latter was quite determined that he would not return to Ras el Khaimah for my visit despite the I fact that it only takes two hours by car. As I was unable to find any adequate excuse for this, I cancelled f, SH0RjSHAM 1 S rt visit to Ras al Khaimah and informed the Sheikh of my reason for doing so.

A large proportion of the Naim tribe amounting to , ii.. 4 about 1000 armed men concentrated at Zubarah, a place to which the Sheikh of Bahrain also’ lays claim, and threatened, if tney received no support from the latter, to transfer their allegiance to Ibn Saud. The trouble appears to have arisen owing to an attempt by the fihaikh of Qatar to collect taxes at Zubarah. ( The situation is still somewhat unsettled, but a visit to Zubarah by the Political Agent, Bahrain, in H•M.S.DKPTFORD has had a salutary effect, and the Naim have now dispersed. BAHKaIN . Visit of Dr. Blegvad . Dr. Blegvad visited 3. Bahrain in his trawler rt Rashgu H at the end of March in order to buy supplies which were unobtainable in Iran. He stated that H..M. the Shah had asked him whether it was possible to establish commercial fisheries in the Persian Gulf and he had replied that it could be done if the money him was put into it. The Shah informed/that money would be forthcoming. KUWAIT. (Bahrain Int. Report). 4. The following is an extract from the Aden Report for the week ending 17th March, 1937:- ’’It is reported that Italian news broadcast from Rome in Arabic was heard at Hodeida on 11th March to the effect that British aeroplanes bombed certain tribes in the interior of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf ' This news as far as can be ascertained was not heard in Kuwait town. Some owners of battery sets live in the desert others on Pailakah Island, and they may have heard it, without it being known to the Agency. (Kuwait Int. Report).7ZO — I RAW . 5. Supreme Defence Council . The most interesting item of legislation presented to the House was the draft law for the establishment of a Supreme Defence Council which passed its third reading towards the end of March. This Council will be under the presidency of the Prime Minister and will include the Ministers of Finance and Economics and Wor^s, as well as the Defence Minister and the Chief of the General Staff. Its function is to be the co-ordination of effort in all matters pertaining to the country*s defence. The plan seems to be a sound one, though it is accepted by the general public as a manoeuvre by Bekr Sidqi to ensure his general control of the defence policy which heretofore has been solely in the hands of the Cabinet in which he has no seat. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 6. Foreign Loan. Questions have been asked in the Chamber concerning the proposal to flat a foreign loan to meet expenditure on the large development works contemplated. The Premier gave a somewhat indefinite reply, but it is known that negotiations are well advanced with a London banking house, and it is probable that this money will be available in the near future. This access of funds should prove very welcome as it will enable the Government to proceed with its programme, and to silence its critics who have latterly been complaining that after five months in office, there are no signs of the material improvements promised. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 7. Ir aq - Iran Frontier Negotiations . These negotiations have recently bt;en proceeding fairly rapidly. The area off Abadan which it is now proposed should be ceded to Iran extends to the Thalweg. The Iraq Government have put forward certain amendments to ensure that, until the establishment of a combined conservancy board ......board, they will have the right to dredge in the Iranian Area and that for the present tney will continue to have full control in the river. None of the amendments put forward would seem to be such that the Iranians could take exception to them. It would therefore appear that the treaty will be concluded fairly shortly, after which further and probably more lengthy negotiations will take place on the subject of the combined conservancy board. As the Iranian Government have now given permission to the A.I.O.C. to build more loading jetties on the Iranian bank of the Shatt al Arab, northward from a point 8 Kilometres above Pao, it is possible that they will soon be asking for a ceded anchorage off these proposed jetties. (S.N.O.P.O. ) 8* Basrah Port Strike . With reference to para. 9 of the March Intelligence Report, there have been no signs of any further trouble and all work has been proceeding normally. (S.N.O. ;\G. ) IRAK. * 9. H.l.M.The Shah's Visit to Khorramshahr. On the day before the visit Shrhang Bayendor ordered all the triumphal arches to be taken down, as he had heard that His Majesty disliked such decorations. His Majesty accompanied by his son arrived by car from Ahwaz and spent the night at the Naval Club. He inspected the Naval Office, Barracks, and all the Sloops in addition to the Customs and other public buildings. Whilst inspecting the^CHAHROKH' he slapped Setwan I Pazuni, the Commanding Officer, in the face for not parading his guard correctly. This is the officer who hauled down the British flag at Basidu. He also deprived Sargord Kahkahi, the recruit training officer, of his rank for not seeing the training properly carried out.He wa&amp;, however, reinstated two .days later at the special request of Sartip ?*.uini, the Officer Qommanding the Ahwaz district. No visit was paid to Abadan which greatly incensed the local inhabitants, who after the Shah passed down river in the , *PALA^JG , * tore down the decorations and threw them into the water after him. (Khorramshahr Int. Report). 10. Landing of cargo at Khorramshahr . The Sherkat Kashtirani Karun has been given the monopoly in landing car^o. In accordance with the orders from the Naval Authorities the Sherkut’s representative gives a receipt to the ship for cargo, but the Shipping Agents are still responsible for handing over the cargo to the Customs on shore. Thus the work and expense are duplicated. The Shipping Agents are permitted to keep their own watchmen onboard the Sherkat’s barges to guard the cargo. The landing charges are 20^ higher than those formerly charged by tne Mesopotamia Iran Corporation. 3o far only six ships have called and handed over 5,600 tons to the Sherkat, instead of the normal ten ships and 10,000 tons per fortnight. (Khorramshahr Int. Report). 11. Baghdad-Tehran Air goute . Three Iranian Air Force Officers recently flew down from Tehran to Baghdad and back to inspect the route. It is reported that the air line will be operated by service pilots using the D.H. Dragon Rapides, wnich were aelivered to Iran a few months ago, or alternatively with Military aircraft. Although this is primarily intended to be a mail service, it is understood that passengers may also be carried when operating experience has been gained. No date of commencement has yet been given. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 12. Iranian Navy. Italian Interests. The Naval Attache of the Italian Legation at Tehran who was on tour in the • • •771 in the Persian Gulf arrived at Khorramshahr on 30th March and left for Tehran the next day.

It is reported that oil in large quantities has been discovered in most of the wells under operation at Al Khobar and that these have now been closed pending further operations.

On his return from Tehran, whither he was sumnoned to discuss the proposed Treaty, the Iranian Minister for Iraq gave it to he understood that the Iraqi proposals had been sympathetically received, but no official communique reporting the progress of the negotiations has yet been made. (R.A.P. Int. Report). 8 . Internal Security . Both the capital and the provinces have remained quiet and no incidents of any importance have been reported. In the Middle Euphrates there are certain disgruntled elements, but there are no indications of an early deterioration in that area, providing that the Government does not do anything to precipitate a crisis by the enforcement of unpopular measures. (R.A.P. Int. Report) 9 . Port Strike - Basrah . It was learnt that a strike of some of the Dock employees occurred about 13th March but was well in hand within a few days. On 24th March it apparently broke out again and it was heard that the ring leaders were being imprisoned. The Mutasarrif was being helpful to the authorities and the Iraqi Police from Ashar were called in. The strike is said to be of Communistic origin on the question of pay. , ^ ('FOWEY' Int. Report) IRAN . 10. Gerrran Trade . A German economic delegation is stated to be on its way from Germany to Tehran to study in detail Iranian requirements of machinery and other goods which can be supplied by Germany’s heavy industries. This delegation is probably one of the direct results of Dr. Schacht’s visit to Tehran in November last. Germany will take cotton and wool from Iran in exchange for this machinery. (R.A.F. Int. Report) 11. Coup d’Etat Review . The usual review was held in Tehran to celebrate the anniversary of the Coup d’Etat. 26,000 troops (including such civilian elements as Boy Scouts and Girl Guides) took part. The Iranian Navy sent up three platoons from Khorramshahr and the Iranian Air Force also provided four platoons. 52 aircraft participated but there were no' demonstrations of aerobatics. It is reported that the Shah, for the first time in the history of this annual review, stated that he was very pleased with it. (R.A.P. Int. Report). 12. Visit of the Shah to Khuzistan . H.M. Reza Shah has been visiting khuzistan during March. He arrived at Khorramshahr from Ahwaz on 19th March and on 20th March proceeded down river for Bandar Shahpur in the PALANG. He also visited Bushire. All the local inhabitants were very much on edge prior to these visits, to date no authentic reports of these visits have been received. (S.N.O.P.G.) 13. Lights and Beacons . On 9th February the Italian construction engineer in the employ of the Iranian Government, who built the foundations for the Bushire Light Beacon, left for Lingah en route for Qais Island to make a similar foundation for another light which is to be installed there.

In continuation of paragraph 16 of the February Intelligence Report. At the same time tnat the Government granted the concession for the exploitation of petroleum in N.E. Iran, they also granted a separate concession for the construction of pipelines. The conditions of the concessions were as follows The Company must, within three years of ratification, choose two provinces in East and N.E. Iran and must, within fifteen years, choose within these provinces an area or areas of not more than 100,000 sauare miles. Exploration is to begin within six months and boring within eighteen months of ratification. The Iranian Government will receive:- (a) Four shillings per metric ton on petroleum sold in IranIran or exported. (*&gt;) A sum equal to 20% of the sum distributed to ordinary shareholders after deduction of a sum equal to b% of the capital invested by the Company in Iran. A minimum payment of £300,000 per annum is guaranteed from the end of the fifth year after concession, rising to £600,000 at the end of the fourteenth year. No mention is made of any immediate cash payment. The pipeline concession provides for the constitution of a separate company known as the Iranian Pipeline Company of U.S.A. This Company will have the right (not exclusive)of constructing a main pipeline to any part of Iran, provided the rights of other companies are respected, and tributary lines to connect the main lines with other lines in Iran or neighbouring countries.

S.N.O., P.G f 8 No.37/522 of 6th February 1937. ^-\ MUSCAT. Qatineh Coast . On 17th December Saiyid Shahab had to proceed to Burkah to evict the Wall Saiyid Majid. The district was found to be in a state of open rebellion and had Saiyid Shahab not proceeded there Saiyid Majid would have been besieged in his house. A new Wali, Hamad bin Hilal - as Sammar, was appointed and the old one was brought back to Muscat. (Muscat Int.Report). 2* Return of the Sultan . The Sultan is returning from Dhofar in the first A.I.O.C. Tanker that passes Salalah in February. (S.N.O.P.G.) TRUCIAL COAST . 3* Frontier Settlement There have been prolonged negotiations between the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai in order to determine the frontier between their Sheikhdoms. The outcome is not yet known, but it is believed that an agreement may be reached. (Bahrain Int.Report). BAHRAIN. 4. D.F.Station . A new Adcock W/T D.p.Station is being erected by Cable A Wireless Limited, and it is expected that it will be in operation in a bout two months time. (S.N.O.P.G.). IRAQ . 3. The Government . Up to the present there have been no sweeping reforms, but many of the Mutasarrifs have been changed into new districts. The idea under-lying these changes is probably that Hikmar desires to retain men with administrative experience, whilst he would prefer them to be working in unfamiliar areas to keep them clear, at least temporarily, of intrigue and favouritism. Hikmar has been experiencing a certain amount of difficulty in holding his cabinet together, da*afar abu Timman, the Minister of Finance, apart from proving somewhat incompetent has been far from dumb at the cabinet meetings and has been at loggerheads with 3ekr Sidqi and the Minister of Justice. There has also been a difference of opinion between Bekr Sidqi and Abdul Latil Nuri, the Minister of Defence, over the extensive transfer of officers that Bekr Sidqi has been making in order to keep the Baghdad garrison loyal to him. It is not anticipated that there will be any immediate changes, but some may take place after the General Election which will occur during February. (R.A.F. Int.Report). Iran-Iraq Frontier Negotiations . The Government has recently re-opened the discussions with the Iranian Government on the question of Frontier Recognition and a note was sent to Tehran in the last week of November. It has been proposed that Iran should recognise the existing frontier from Turkey to the Persian Gulf, while Iraq, as a quid pro quo, will cede to Iranan anchorage area in the Shatt el Arab off Abadan, with certain reservations regarding free navigational facilities through the newly acquired Iranian waters. No official reply has yet been received from Tehran, but it is understood that the proposal has been favourably received and this may possibly lead to some progress being made in these negotiations. (R*A.F.Int.Report). 7. Relations with Palestine . A delegation arrived in Baghdad at the end of December and held several conversations with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is understood that the advice preferred to them was to abandon the policy of non co-operation and to give the fullest evidence before the Royal Oommission. The delegation then left for Riyadh where no doubt they received the same advice from Ibn Baud. (R*A*F#Int.Report)♦ 8. Middle Euphrates . Bekr Sidqi made a tour of the lower Iraq garrisons in December and a t the same time took the opportunity of assessing local feeling towards the Government. It appears that the tribes, which were in rebellion in 1935 and 1936, consider they contributed largely to the fall of the Hashimi Government and are expecting a reward in the form of remission of taxes and the return of their banished leaders. Bekr Sidqi has strongly recommended that no measures should for the present be enforced, which might alienate popular feeling in this area. (R.A.F. Int.Report)• IRAN. 9. A ssistant Governor of Khorramshahr . With reference to paragraph 11 of last month 1 s Intelligence“Report, the name of the new Assistant Governor is Agha Ahmed Ashraf. (Khorramshahr.Int.Report)• 10. Imports at Khorramshahr . From the exceptional quantities of cargo arriving at present it would appear that the various Monopoly Departments have ordered their annual quotas of imports in single consignments. The existing Customs organisation is quite unable to compete with it and all available space on the banks of the Karun river has been taken up for use as dumps for goods. Barge hire has risen from 100 to 500 Rials, per day. (Khorramshahr Int.Report). 11. Seaplane Station . An Iranian Air Force Officer attached to the Ministry of War, arrived at Khorramshahr, to inspect the Karun, it is said, with a view to the establishment of a seaplane base. (Khorramshahr Int.Report). 12. Japanese Salt Company . It is reported that a Company named the ^Japanese Salt Exploitation Company*’ has been formed and that its Manager, an Iranian named Danishwar, with three Japanese Engineers have arrived at Quishn Island. The output from the Salt Caves was reported to be 400 tons in December and it is understood that they hope to improve on this figure. (Bushire Int.Report). 13. Iranian Navy - Movements .

The Sheikhs are understood to have taken the line that they have given the option to Petroleum Concessions Limited, and that until the options expire they are not willing to negotiate with others. (Bahrain InUReport). HASA. California Arabian Standard Oil Company . It is rumoured that the Company may stop drilling operations at Al Khobar owing to the demand by the Saudi Government for £30,000 which sura is payable when oil is obtainable in commercial quantities. So far no oil has been obtained. (Bahrain Int.Report). 16* B ahrain Petroleum Company . During the month of January the Directors of the Company have visited Bahrain and it is understood that arrangements have been come to with the Texas Corporation relative to the disposal of the oil through the Texas selling agencies. It is also reported that the Italians are prepared to take up some of the oil and that they are building three tankers of 13,000 tons each. (SNOPG and Bahrain I.R.j 17. Export of Oil .

Considerable inconvenience is being caused to the A.I.O.C. by the regulation that all their Iranian employees are to be registered - including a photograph. Captain Bayendor has been instructed to carry this out and he has asked for 200 a day to be sent to Khorammshahr* By sending a larger number the Company anticipate that the organization will fail and will get tired of it first ! It is reported that, in future, all employees of the Company will have to be engaged through the Iranian authorities at the Khorammshahr base. Great training activity was evident in the base; Squad drill, which was going on when I called at 0930, was still in progress until sunset* Information from Abadan indicates that the negotiations between Iraq and Iran over the allocation to the latter of certain anchorages and later, possibly, the turning over to them of half the River have reached a more advanced stage and developments may soon be expected. 20. Should the A.I.O.C. develop their loading facilities it is understood that jetties will be built in the Kasba Reach one mile above Pao. 21 21. The drilling of the first oil well of the Kuwait Oil Company has now reached a critical stage and oil has been found, though up to now it is not known if it is in commercial (jiaitities.

A boat was sent for the Wall at 1330, who came off to make his call, which was subsequently returned at 1545. An American Military Mission, consisting of one lady doctor - a Miss Hosmon - with one Anglo-Indian and one Indian lady assistant, were under canvas on the border of the village, and I also called here. They had been installed at Shinas since October, 1936* Their headquarters for each winter is at Muscat. Seven Indian subjects trade in the small bazaar and apparently get on very well with the Arabs. They have been there for periods varying from seventeen to three years. X X X XINDEXED ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION SHOULD m/ — BE ADDRESSED TO- THE SECRETARY or THE ADMISALTY LONDON. S.W.I.

On 2nd April, Sri A.0.A.Sutton and M. le Comte Jean D’Oncieu, members of the 'Anglo-Iraqian Oil Co., which is under stood to be a combined British French and American concern, arrived from the Yemen, having had the Inara’s licence to prospect the coast for oil. They requested permission to investigate Kamaran Island, but the Administrator, acting on instructions from Aden, reminded them of the international character of the place and regretted,that he could not all^w it. They left again for Ib’n Abbas ....* Ib f n Abbas, on their way north, the same day. X X X X 34. I sailed from Kamaran at 0630 3rd April, and anchored in Hodieda roads at 1130, saluting the country witi 21 guns on doing so, the salute being promptly returned. I subsequently learned from the local Political Officer that WESTON's coming has not been notified from Aden, and that the hope had been expressed by the Hodeida authorities that such an omission would not become a habit. Through-out the visit the wind was Southerly and fresh, with a moderate sea, and communication with the shorewwas conducted entirely by dhow. 35. Preliminaries having been arranged on arrival, I landed, accompanied by two officers at 0900 4th April, and j having inspected the guard and banc., and praised the latterif really remarkable mastery of their brass instruments, callec on His Excellency Saiyed Abdulla al Wazir, the Governor, together with Mr. Saleh Ja’jfar, the British Assistant Frontier Officer, His Excellency appears to be very friendly, as apart from the usual exchange cf conventional courtesies: he turned the conversation after a I while to the Palestine situation, and after extolling the virtues and ^rights” of the Palestinian Arabs at some length, laid stress on the expectations which the Moslem world entertained of Great Britain’s aoing justice to them.■ I have previously found this claim a difficult one to course v/ithin the bounds of tact, add contented myself with emphasising the great experience of the British in dealing with Moslem peoples, the satisfaction of the great majority of the latter who are under their rule, and the very genuine axxiety of the Government to do justice to all concerned. His Excellency thereupon remarked somewhat , pointedly that it might have unfortunate results in the Moslem countries if the last-named result were not — in their opinion - achieved. In conversation with Mr. Saleh da*far and his brother, Mr. Hussein da*far, now the local Political Clerk, and with the resident agent of Messrs. Gellatlsr, Hankey &amp; Co., I gathered that Saiyed Abdulla al Wizar is fully maintaining his influence and prestige as the principal figure in the Yemen, after the Imam and the Crown Prince - and possibly before the latter. It remains very hard to say what his attitude towards external Powers would be in the event of the Imam’s demise but there is no evidence of his shewing himself unfriendly towards the British. With reference to the recent call of the Italian leader ”TIGBK‘* at Kamaran, it is perhaps noteworthy that it is a long time since any Italian warship visited Hodeida. My call on the Governor was returned on the morning of 5th April by Kazi al Amri, his Secretary, who remained on board about an hour ana a quarter, and was particularly pleased by being shewn round the engine-room before leaving. I understand that he is likely to be a principal member of the suite of Prince Hussein at the Coronation: he has been in Europe before - a great rarity among Yemen Officials. 36. At. 1200 4th April the E.T.C. cable ship ’’LADY DENISON PENDER” was heard asking Kamaran for assistance for a case of suspectea tetanus, and was directed to close WESTON, Kamaran having no anti-tetanus serum. She arrived in Hodeida roads at 1500, and my medical officer proceeded on board: the Indian patient, however proved to be an advanced case of cerebral haemorrhage, and died at 1800.(*3 It should be recorded that the Governa-, on Rearing of the case, imciedlately directed the local pharmacy to be places at the disposal of ray medical officer, and a dhow to be at his service for transport to the cable ship. 37.

A passport system and a strict watch on the ports has been instituted by the Iranians to prevent this wholesale desertion, the cause appears to be the extreme poverty of the country and the dislike of conscription. 2. The Governnent have issued an w Arms Ordnance Proclamation ,, which prohibits the import or export of firearms, or their manufacture and provides for the issue of licences for the possession of arms already in the possession of approved persons. The regulation does not apply to firearms imported for the use of His Majesty’s Government or the Bahrain Governmen 3. Relations with Palestine . Members of the ruling family have expressed the opinion that the Arabs in Palestine are prepared to accept much less than the Arab Council have demanded. Such uncompromising demands have only been made to ensure that they get the best possible terms. 4. Death of Yassin al Hashlml . Yassin al Hashimi died in Beyrout on 21st January, the late Prime Minister has passed on at a time when it is fashionable in Iraq to heap recrimina tions on his head, thus his body remains buried in Damascus instead of in his own country - a graceless ending to one who was probably only second to the late King Faisal in leading Iraq to independence. been without words of disagreement and the general impression given is that the Premier’s intentions of governing constitu tionally are losing ground, and that Bekr Sidqi’s influence in administrative matters is on the increase. 7.

The Sheikh of KALBA told mo that 400 had arrived in hla vicinity in the last 6 or 8 months. Apparently a strict passport system has boon Instituted, and a close watch is being kept at Iranian ports and, it seems, at sea for those who are leaving tho Country. Poverty there is reported to be extreme, and the prospect of conscription in the Navy or Army does not appeal. 17 17. One or two oases of robbery, one resulting in tho death of a traveller, have been reported from the BATINXH, but no foreigners have been involved.

He went to Berlin for an operation and has brought back grandiose stories of the honourable way in which the German Government treated him. They no doubt showed him some courtesy, but the yarns lose nothing in the telling, as he was somewhat incensed at not being taken with Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa on his Official visit to London. KUWAIT. (Bahrain I.R.) The Kuwait authorities announce a new count of heads in Kuwait town and say that the total is 100,000. This rather suspiciously round number seems high but a show of proof, which it is difficult to gainsay, has been put forward to support the figure. With the nomads and the inhabitants of the local villages, this brings the total in Kuwait territory up to 120,000. (Kuwait I.R.) IRAwI RAW . 5. The Gove r nment. There have been no startling developments during the month under review, but in all cases the instructions to observe cordial relations with British advisors and officials have been observed. The Chamber of Deputies, due to reunite on 1st November, was dissolved by Royal Proclamation on 31st October, and it was announced that a general election would be held at an early date. So far nothing has been done to set the machinery in motion and there appears to be some truth in the report that the Prime Minister intends to postpone, possibly indefinitely, the assembly of a new Parliament on the grounds that it is an expensive and unproductive institution. Fortunately Hikmar Suleiman was strong enough to resist Bekr Sidq^s request that a military tribunal should be established to ensure that all pro-Hashimi elements should be eliminated. Since when BexT Sidqi has devoted his energies to plans for military re- organisation and seems to have been satisfied by the Prime Minister’s acceptance of his schemes and by the promise of financial aid, though where this latter is coming from it is difficult to see, as the last Government left the Treasury quite empty. (R.A.F., I.R.) 6. Palestine Policy . At an early date after his arrival to power, the new Premier of Ijaq was importuned into pronouncing the policy of the new Government towards the Palestine Problem. He stated in general terms that his Government would continue the policy of the Hashimi Cabinet in giving support to tie righteous claims of their Arab brothers in I'alestine. It car, however, be accepted that Hi tartar Sueiman intends, for the time being at least, not to participate to the extent to which his predecessors did, as his immediate Interests lie far more in the solution of the many domestic problems. (R.A.F. I.R.)7. Army . Since the coup d’etat there has 'been a re-distribution of units. The Baghdad garrison has only been increased by one Guards battalion but the remainder of the garrison is composed of troops on whom Bekr Sidqi can rely, while the less dependable finite have been relegated to provincial centres. (R.A.P. I.R.) IRAK. 6. Kconomic conditions . It has been reported from Kermanshah that trie cost of living during the past year has increased progressively, and prices of commodities in general use are now as much as 100^ fegi higher than they were a year ago. The blame for this is considered to rest on the Government’s system of monopoly trading. The shortage of stocks in many imported commodities has encouraged dealers to raise their prices, thereby causing considerable dissatisfaction with the Administration, which appears to be powerless to check the upward trend of prices, if indeed any effort to do so is made. (R.A.F. I.R.) 9. Prohibition of the Cultivation of Opium . A circular order has been received from Teheran, by the Revenue Dept., Bushire, stating that the cultivation of opium in Iran is prohibited and that the opium poppy should not be sown any longer. They have circulated the order and at the same time, raised the banderole tax on opium to Rials 2 a misqal. (l/6th of an oz.) (Bushire I.R.) 10. Customs Buildin&amp;s at Khorramshahr . The Belgian Engineer engaged on the re-construction of the Customs Buildings has erected an electric crane. This crane is mounted on caterpillars and is driven by an oil engine coupled to a dynamo. It is said to be able to lift 14 tons (Khonamshahr I.R.)11 . Assistant Governor at Khorramshahr and Abadan. With reference to para. 9 of the October Intelligence Report. Agha Zand has now left for Ardebil. Agha Perzaneh will continue as Governor of both places and has been sent an Assistant Governor to help him. Agha Ferzaneh is now living in Abadan. (S.N.O., P.G. ) 12. Iranian Fisheries. The Iranian Government have engaged Dr. H. Blegvad, Director of the Danish Biological Station to report on the fisheries in the Gulf. A 40 ton motor trawler with a crew of 3 is being shipped out during the first week of January; owing to its size it will have to be hoisted out in Basra, as nowhere else is there a crane capable of dealing with it. The investigations are expected to take about 6 months. (S.N.O., P.G.) 13. Seizure of Omani Dhow . On 22nd October an Iranian Customs Launch seized an Omani dhow, carrying firewood, about 4 miles off Hormuz and brought it into Bandar Abbas. The crew were arrested and two rifles were confiscated, the charge being that they were carrying arms in Iranian territorial waters. On 30th October the crew and dhow were released but the rifles have been retained. (Correspondence with P.R.) 14. Iranian Navy. Movements. Arrive Place Leave.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, .1937 J ijar'vt^rH^TrTT of the August 2. With reference Inteligence Report, information was obtained from the Wali of Khassab on 15th November 1936 that two Shihuh dhows from Bokha were proceeding to Muscat. The Political Agent, Muscat, was authorised by the Political Resident to arrange for these dhows to be impounded by the Muscat Government, this was duly done at Matrah on 15th November 1936. Rs.950 were found onboard, this sum was also impounded, but up to the present it has not been determined whether it is shihuh property or not. The dhows themselves have been valued at Rs.300 each. Thus at present the dhows and money are held against the fine of Rs.1000 or the surrender of the murderer. The crews are being sent back to spread the news amongst the Shihuh and further operations are in abeyance until the effect of this seizure is known. The Wali also reoorted that Hasan bin Rahmah had been elected Sheikh of the Shihuh on 21st October 1936 and had gone to live at Bai'ah. The previous Sheikh Mohamad has retired to live in Kumzar.

This visit was in connection with the proposed move of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain. • ('FOY/EY' Report of Proceedings) KUWAIT 5. Relations with Palestine. A committee was formed at the beginning of October to raise relief funds for the Arabs in Palestine, in all a sum of Rs.7,500 was collected, but before it could be sent the Strike came to an end. The money has now been put on deposit in a Bombay Bank against another very rainy day like that which destroyed a quarter of the town in the winter of 1934. (Kuwait Int. Report) %6. Serious Accident to Secon d Son of the Ruler . Sheikh Mohammad al Ahmad as Subah sustained serious injuries and concussion in a motor car accident near Amara on 3rd November. He is normally in charge of the Sheikh's date gardens in Iraq, this accident has not made him very popular with the rest of the family, as this is the season when he should be distributing the profits made on the year'o working. (Kuvait Int. Report). IRAQ. 7. The Coup d'Stat and its results. The course of events has been fully reported in the Press, but it is not easy to arrive at the causes of it apart from the personal ambitions of Bekr Sidqi. It is certain that Ghazi was getting tired of the supervision over his private life after the palace scandals of June last, Nuri as Said in particular had been very outspoken. It is, therefore, possible that the germ of the idea was sown when Bekr Sidqi interviewed the King on 12th October on the former's return from Central Europe. The friendship of the King and Bekr Sidqi dates from 1933 when the present King, then Crown Prince, marched into Baghdad with Bekr Sidqi at the head of the so-called victorious army after massacring the Assyrians. It is also certain: that the Coup d'Etat had to take place before 30th October, as far as Bekr Sidqi was concerned as this was the date when the Chief of the General Staff was due back from leave in Europe to relieve him. Arrangements had already been made f or the Army to concentrate close to Baghdad for combined manoeuvres and it only remained for Bekr to get the senior Air Force Officer, Mohammed Ali Jowad, on his side. No inkling that anything unusual was afoot was received by the outside world until 28th October when the Iraqi \ir Force left Hinaidi to join the Army, carrying live bombs. The Coup d'Etat was carried out with a skill and organisation that is rarely met with in Iraq and it is of interest to observe that Bekr Sidqi had attended a course at the Staff College at Camberley and Mohamed Ali Jowad had been to Cranwell. Tiie new Prime Minister has got an encouraging start as his predecessor had become very unpopular, and he is starting off with a programme of reform, which though a great deal of it is incapable of achievement, nevertheless arouses a considerable enthusiasm with many sections of the country. His main difficulty is likely to be in dealing with the Army, which has placed him in power, as it is extremely doubtful whether Bekr Sidqi will be content with merely being the Chief of the General Staff. At present he is carrying out certain reforms to the Army and making fresh appointments, to get it more solidly behind him. (R.A.F. Int. Report).8. Middle Euphrates. Though there was still a certain amount of trouble before the Coup d’Etat, this has now quietened down, everybody is sitting on the fence to see whether the new Government’s so-called lenient policy will make any change. 9. Palestine Reaction . In the period following the cessation of the Arab strike, the Jewish community in Baghdad were thrown into a state of panic by a series of murders and only the bolder Hebrews showed themselves in public after sundown. There is no evidence that the Government had anything to do with these terrorist acts and it is probable that they were carried out by Baghdadi thugs for their own ends. Up to the present the new Government has made no official announcements as to their Palestine policy, but it seems likely that it will carry on with that of its predecessors. (R.A.P* Int. Report) 10. The Army . An attempt is being made to introduce a scheme of voluntary service in addition to the conscription. Volunteers may re-engage every two years up to the age of 40 after which they will receive a pension. So far little interest has been displayed in the scheme. (R.A.P. Int. Report). IRAN . 11 . Navy .

The Shah, in person, has opposed the scheme urging thatthat Bandar Shapur is the 'best port. In point of fact there is no sheltered anchorage of any sort for the dock off Dastak and even the Inner Anchorage at Bushire is not sheltered, so it would appear to he most improbable that anything will come of this scheme.

The Sheikha and their relatives were most picturesqui and, with the exception of Umm Al Quwain v/ho was fat, were very fine looking men. The Sheikh of Dubai was outstanding and is ack.iowledged the cleverest of the lot; he was friendly and took great trouble to ingratiate himself. 6. The customary line of a -proach in conversation and exchanging ail the courtesies through interpreters did not give time to obtain their views on important subjects. It was, however, apparent that they would rather retain Britain’s protection, than rely on that of the League of Nations. 7• They were each presented with cartridges and a memento of their visit, and given their appropriate salutes on departure. 8. Sheikh Abu Dhabi was not present as he had proceeded uo country for his brother’s wedding before the intimation of the Commander-in-Chief’s visit had n ached him. He was absent at the last visit of the Gormunder-in-Chief to the Persian Gulf, but it v/as confirmed that the excuse for his absence on this occasion was genuine. At 1400 the Coinnander-in-Chief transferred his flag to SHOIlEHAM, and at 1600 3H0RKHAM sailed for Doha, and NORFOLK for Bahrein. DOHA. 9. SHORKHAM arrived at Doha at 0940, 8th October, and at 1100 the Sheikh of Qatar cane off to call in his own dhow, accomuanied by his sons and graibBons. The Sheikh, who is a most distinguished looking old man and well net up for his years, showed great friendliness. He invited the Commander-in-Chief to land and visit him, but, in view of the fact that the Trucial Sheikhs had not been visited and on the advice of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, the invitation was declined. At 1200 8H KEHAM sailed for Bahrein. BAHRAIN. 10# SHORKHAM and NORFOLK arrived at Bahrein at 0700 # and 0800 the Cormander-in-Chlef transferred his flag to NORFOLK after the latter had Fired a salute. Calls were exchanged with the Political Agent and the Sheikh of Bahrein. During the visit the Sheikh of Bahrein entertained the Comnnnder-in- Chief and five officers to an Arab dinner, and the Sheikh and other members of the ruling family wore entertained to dinner on board NORFOLK. All were gr* atly impressed by the Sheikh who had only recently returned from his visit to England, and who had obviously been much pleased by the attention and hospitality which had been shown him. Ho is a nan of great distinction and charm, and is greatly loved by his people, who have access to him at all tines. He is a good and just ruler and does not exist like some of the others merely to fill his own pockets. -1. With the discovery of oil and the energy of the /BahreinBahrein Oil Company, much wealth has been brought to the Island, and the number of European and American residents has risen from about 12 to over 200* On the invitation of Mr. Skinner, the local General Manager of the Oil Connany, a most energetic and able American, visits were pfeid to the oil fields, the living quarters and the refinery. Construction is proceeding at full sneed. The present output from the wells is 3,500 tons daily to be increased eventually to 7f000 tons dally. It is not anticipated that the refinery will be in full production for another 12 months. Gr at attention is paid to the comfort of the employees in the way of proper cold storage and games, and a gardener from Kew is employed in trying to grow grass and generally improve the barren and scorched look of the country. * * H * MU KUWKIT. 13. At 1045 on 15th October, NORFOLK and 3H0REHAM sailed for Kuweit and arrived at 1000 the following day. Calls were exchanged with the Political Agent and the Bheikh* The bheikh gave a dinner party, European style, and arranged a hawking exoedition (new style - by motors) in honour of the visit* In return, he was entertained to dinner on board NOkPOLK. He is an intelligent man and affects European manners and though he says he speaks no English and understands very little, it is likely that his knowledge of the language is greater than he would have one believe. Af er the dinner at his Palace he displayed a pearl, one of the largest in the world, which was found off his coast. He has already refused an offer of £10,000 for it. 14. He is anxiously awaiting the results of the boring for oil now in progrers in order to improve the state of hie revenue. He envies the royalties now accruing to his neighbour the Oheikh of Bahrein. At present, the one well bored has reached a depth of 3,000 feet, but no oil has yet been found. 15. NORFOLK sailed for Basrah at midnight 15/16th October. BA SHAH AND BAGHDAD, 16. NORFOLK and 3H0RKHAM arrived at Basrah at 1600, 16th Oatober, and the following day calls were exchanged with the Acting Consul (W. Hendry, Esq., The Manager of the -astern Bank) nnd the Mutaeurrif. The snail British Colony and the Royal Air Force stationed at Basrah were most hospitable to both Officers and men, and there wns a cocktail party daily, and often a dance and much private entertaining. The efficiency of the arrangements made by Mr. Hendry for the visit was altogether admirable, in spite of heavy pressure of work at his business. 17.

Their physique and soldierly bear^ m? were impressive. ^ 18. During the stay at Baghdad the Commander^*in-Chi^f was received in audience by King Ghazi. His Majesty, a yoxin^ man, in the early twenties, of no personality, speaks /EnglishIll English fluently. He h a a diffident maimer and appears to lack self-assurance, but it ia understood that he has of late improved greatly in this respect, 19* A dinner party was given by the Ambassador on 20th October for the purpose of introducing the Commander-in- Chief to the three moot prominent members of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, General Yasin al Hashirai, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, General Wuri al 3aid, G,C,V.O., C.M.G., and the Minister for Defence, General Jafar al ASkari, G.C.V,0. # . The Minister of Defence is the only official, one knows, who has received decorations from both sides during one war, viz., Iron Cross, Turkish Cross, Legion d’honneur and Distinguished Service Order. The Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, Air Vice- Marshal Vf.O.S. Mitchell, C.B., C.B.K., D.3.O., M.C., A.F.C., was also present. 20* Since that evening, information has been received from the Press and confirmed by the Ambassador that, following a military coup d'etat, the old cabinet has resigned. The Minister for Defence, a prominent Anglophile, was shot, and it is understood that the other two Ministers, also Anglophiles, have been exiled. The cause of the army's nccion is said to be dissatisfaction with the way the Government handled the crisis in the middle Euphrates. 21. The Commander-in-Chief and his Personal Staff returned to Basrah on 24th October and called on His Majesty King Ghasl, who was staying at Basrah prior to a trip down river in the yacht of the Director of the Port Trust. 22. His Majesty visited NORFOLK on Sunday, £5th October, and was shown round the Upper Deck. He did not appear to be much interested in v/hat he saw, but was genuinely pleased at being invited on board. ABADAN. 23. NORFOLK left Basrah at 0930, 28th October and arrived at Abadan at 1230. On passage ship was slowed down above Khorramshahr and a 21 gun salute fired to Iran. The salute was returned, and was followed by M 0od save the King' played by a Military Band which had been specially imported for the occasion and which had been practising assiduously for a week. The result was entirely recognisable. The Flag of the Comnander-in-Chief was then saluted and the salute re turned. 24. Calls were exchanged with the Governors of Abadan and Khorramshahr, and the Iranian Naval Authorities. The latter showed much hospitality and friendliness during the visit, and it is hoped that some good nay follow the personal contact. The hospitality of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is proverbial, and many games were played with the Staff. 25. A dinner an dance was given on board NORFOLK, and the ship's concert party, a talented combination aided by an exceptional ship's band, gave an excellent performance ashore, which was greatly appreciated by the large British Community. 26 27 26. NORFOLK was open to visitors on one afternoon and was visited by large numbers of both the British and Iranian employees of the Company. BUSHIRK. 27. NORFOLK left Abadan at 0900, 1st November, and /arrivedoff Buehire at OBOO, iind November. Bhip anchored off B.iahire, and splendid weather was experienced during the whole of the viait. 28, Calls were exchanged with the Political Hesident (Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.I«K«) and the Governor. Much hospitality was shown by Colonel and Mrs. Powle during the stay and the whole of the British Colony, numbering about 20, were met frequently. One got the feeling that they were all rather down on their luck owing to the irritating restrictions imposed by the Iranian Government and the complete severance of all social relations with the people of the country. 29# They all lunched on board and listened to the ship^ band, and the genuine pleasure they showed at meeting some of their countrymen mid being once more under the British flag, if only for a little while, was really quite moving. It was the most apnreciative comiunity who have yet been entertained. KHOR KUVMI. 30. NORFOLK left at 1800, 4th November. if x x * it it MUSCAT. 33. Calls were exchanged with the Political Agent and the Sultan*s representative. The Sultan is living 800 miles from Muscat and rarely visits his capital, and the Political Agent finds it increasingly difficult to transact business. 34. A visit was paid to the Muscat Levies commanded by a retired British Amy Officer, Captain Byard. Their smartness, turn-out and discipline were a credit to British training.

He also said he wished the British sloops visited Henjam more often. (i) A poxy little boy attended the meeting (probably, on account of the food) and was introduced as the Governor’s son* The Governor apologised for the boy’s complexion and asked if we would have some lotion made up from a prescription he had as there was a shortage of drugs in the island. He also asked if the boy could cone on board to see 1 our medical officer. I replied that we would be very glad to have the prescription made up and to see the boy on board, but suggested that medical etiquette might make it difficult for our medical * officer to see the boy when a qualified practitioner (the Healtli Officer) was in residence ashore* The sense of this was lost in the interpretation, and * as the Governor seemed to think that we would not deal with the boy, I invited the Governor to cone on board himself at 1800 and to bring the boy with him. This was accepted. (j) We then took our leave and went to see the Chiefs of Police, who had also sent messages to ask me to come and see him* The Chief of Police, who is a pleasant fat man, also appeared extremely glad to see us (I imagine any strange face is welcome in Henjam), and filled us with sickly lemonade to show his appreciation* He did not think much of Hen,jam, or the Governor, and || criticised each impartially* /A RMMMI mmmm\ z'-N V A daughter aged two or three was brought in but ran for her life on sighting me # I also invited the Chief of Police to cone on board a‘ 1800 and to bring the daughter. He accented for both. (k) We then went off to the ship, leaving the Interpreter ashore to visit old friends )f his, and to acquire local information from them. A verbal nesaage was sent by him to the Health Office} asking him also to cone on board at 1000. (l) The conversations with the Governor and Chief of Police were not productive of any startling items of intelli gence. Kach had been in a better situation previously and die not appreciate the change. The told me that life was very dull in Henjam, and that employment was difficult to obtain. Iranian gunboats call about once every 30 days or so, and sometimes fuel from a smalJyiightcr moored near the pier. This seems to hold about 160 tons of oil, and it is refilled periodically by a ”tug boat M from Abadan. (m) There is, of course, no W/T communication with the outside world now, though telegraphic communication to Bund® Abbas is effective. (n) A lot of the inhabitants have emigrated to other parts of the Gulf, including Bahrain. Seven youths have recently been conscripted and taken to Khoramshahr for training in Iranian Navy. (o) The interpreter heard that a Japanese Company has obtained a concession to work salt from the salt lake (?) near Khargu on Qiehm Island in exchange for importing cement into Persia. One hundred cases of blasting material for use in mining the salt have been stored near the old British football ground at Henjam, and it is understood the Japanese pay 20 Tomans a month for this to be guarded. Blasting operations are expected to start in October next. The Iranian employees of the Salt Company are living in 2 ex - Cables &amp; Wireless bungalows in Henjam. (p) The Naval guard stationed ait Hen jam consists of 1 N.C.O. and 7 men who are supplied by the gunboats, and who are under orders of the Chief of Police. They occupy the building formerly used as the British ! Naval Officers’ Club. The Naval Guard looks after the oil barge. , (q) There are 24 N.C.O's and men in the police force, wearing a fairly smart blue grey uniform with shorts, puttees, and good boots. Most of the 24 appeared to be on duty in various parts of the village during our visit, and were most punctilious about saluting. (r) Humours heard were - (a) The Iranians will shortly occupy Bahraii (b) The A.I.O.C. are about to re-commence drilling operations at Kavarceen on Qlshm Island. /(■O®) (e) The cenetery party was landed during the dog watches when it wan cooler, and finished repainting the inscriptions and crosses on the graves. (t) At 1800 the Governor, Chief of Police, and Health Of icer cane off in our boat in response to my invitation. The Governor arrived at the pier first with his spotty little boy, and was followed a few minutes later by the Chief of Police and Health Officer. The Policeman’s daughter would not cone. A considerable commotion on the pier was then seen from the ship, and our interpreter (who was present) tells me that it was due to the Health Officer discovering that the Governor’s little boy was bei'ig brought on board to see our doctor. It appears that the Health Officer i»efu8ed to come off unless the child went home, so this was effected, and except for the remonstrances of the child at being done out ox' a party, superficial calm was restored. (u) The three officials came on board and two of BIDSFOKD’s officers helped me to entertain them. Nothing of interest occurred and they left about an hour later, apparently well pleased with themselves and with our visit.

S.N.O., P.G , s No.264/622 of 2nd Norember, 1936. KUWAIT . Reactions to Palestine Disturbances . Radio broadcasts in Arabic from Italy, Prance and Germany have been frequent and in the case of Italy often of extremely strong political tone. The Ruler and other notables have mentioned in private conversation how much they regret that Great Britain does not issue a broadcast in Arabic designed to counter mischievously intended foreign broadcasts. (Kuwait Int. Report) IRAQ . 2. Middle East Pact . Nuri as Said issued a statement when in Istanboul that the Middle East Pact between Iran, Iraq., Turkey and Afghanistan was ready for signature. However, it remains to be seen what effect the recent coup d’etat in Baghdad will have upon it. (R.A.F. Int. Report) 3. Reactions to Palestine Disturbances . An efficient agency had been established in Baghdad for the sale of small arms of all sorts to private individuals. Supplies seemed to be unlimited and to be received from Syria and the Persian Gulf. The arms and ammunition were new and mostly of German and Belgian manufacture. A considerable percentage of these arms were finding their way into Palestine in addition to a number of recruits to help the Arab cause. (R.A.F. Int. Report) 4. Relations of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah . The sons recently eluded the Tehran police and escaped to Basrah, where it is reported that they have been granted Iraqi naturalisation. They have been settling up their late father’s affairs. The Iranian authorities are nervous about the presence of Sheikh Chassib in Basrah, as he is very popular with the?-?9 tribesmen of Khuzistan and they are doing their best to prevent the tribal chiefs from communicating with him. (R.A.F. Int. Report) 5. Civil Aviation in Iraq . Misr Air Lines have started to operate their Cairo-Baghdad weekly service, planes leaving Cairo on Wednesdays and Baghdad on Sundays. There is also a ,, Bhuttle' , service leaving Baghdad for Haifa on Fridays and returning to Baghdad the same day. At present these services carry passengers only, but it is understood that negotiations are in progress to allow them to carry mails and freight. Aircraft are of the four engined D.H.86 type and can accommodate ten passengers. K.L.M. have cut out Bushire from their winter schedule and now use the Basrah airport, going direct from there to Jask. It is not at present known whether they will again use Bushire in the summer. IRAN. / (R.A.F. Int. Report and S.N.O.P.G, 6- Trade . On 1st September the Customs Authorities at \ Bushire, acting under orders from Tehran, prevented the clearance of all motor vehicles from the Customs, stating that their 1 importation had become a Government monopoly. After protests from the local merchants the enforcement of the Act was postponed for one week. Wheat has now become a Government monopoly and no private trader is now allowed to engage in the purchase or sale of it. It is reported that the Government has contracted to barter 80,000 tons of it with Germany in exchange for machinery and loaf sugar. As this consignment is to be shipped from Bandar Shapur, godowns built of concrete and cement are being erected there. (Bushire and Khorramshahr Int. Reports)IRANIAN NAVY. 7. Damming the Karun River . It is reported that H.M. Reza Shah is expected to visit Khuzistan shortly to open the new road bridge and to inspect a site for a dam across the Karun at Ahwaz. He is also expected to visit Bandar Shapur to examine the plans for its improvement and for the suggested Naval Base. (Khorramshahr Int. Report) ®. Movements .

(S.N.O.P.G.) 9. New Governor or Abadan . Agha Perzaneh has succeeded Agha Zand and is combining the duty with that of Governor of Khorramshahr. It would appear that he is going to be very much less under the direct control of the Governor General of Khuzistan than was the case with Zand. He is a much more go ahead type of man than Zand. Agha Zand is transferred to Ardebil and the Agha Perzaneh will live in Abadan in the same house as the late Governor. (S.N.O.P.G.)Ca^5) OIL. 10. Trucial Coast . With reference to paragraph 21 of September Intelligence Report, it is reported that although the concession has not actually been signed by the Sheikh of Debai, Kajor Holmes made him a personal gift of Rs. 20,000 just prior to the letter’s departure for London. is more chance of oil being found in the Sheikhdoms of Debai and Abu Dhabi suggested that all the Trucial Sheikhs should combine and demand a consolidated concession from Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Sheikh of Debai, however, saw through this scheme and refused to have anything to do with it. 11. Bahrain . The following tankers embarked oil during the period 1st - 15th September: (Bahrain Int. Report) 12. Kuwait . The well at Balra has reached a depth of approximately 3000 feet at which point the rigmen have had the misfortune to break the boring bits twice in succession.

The company have arranged to run a direct monthly service from Hew York to the Persian Gulf, the first ship is to leave New York on 24th October. The attraction to the company is the amount of stores available in New York for shipment to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The ships are being taken from the New York - South Africa run, which is proving unprofitable. It would also appear that they wish to start their own Agency in Bahrain and give up using the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation. It is most unlikely that the Bahrain Government would agree to this as earlier in the year they refused a similar request by the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Limited* They informed them that while they were quite agreeable to the agency remaining in the hands of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, the only alternative was to put it in the hands of a Bahrain Arab. It is also reported that several of the Company’s ships are running with three engineers instead of four as the demand for engineers for the Navy is causing a shortage.

(S.N.O., P.O) IRAQ* 4* Assyrian Situation . With reference to paragraph 11 of the August Intelligence Report# the general effect of the circulation of the news of the failure of the Ghab settlement scheme# has been one of complete hopelessness* A few cling to the belief that the League of Nations will make further endeavours to find a home for them, but most of the more intelligent ones consider the whole question to be a closed and tragic episode* It is probable that those with sufficient money will emigrate and the remainder will presumably continue their day to day existence in a state of apathy# remaining as ready material in the hands of any trouble maker. (R.A.F. Int*Report) 6* Reactions to the Palestine Disturbances * Control of the newspapers remains much as before, except for one scurrilous pro-Arab pamphlet which is published daily for the price of one fil; it is possible that this latter is merely intended as a safety valve for extreme opinion* The feeling of the effendi class has# however# become much more pro-British probably due to the Montreux Agreement and/(33D i and the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Ao a result of this improvement Hurl as 8a f id» the Iraqi Foreign Minister f arrived in Palestine on 20th August» with British approval# to discuss matters with the i rato Leaders. This intervention is probably to keep in line with Ibn Baud who has also sent his representative. It is reported that the relief fund is not restricting itself to the supply of money# but is sending rifles and am unition to Palestine. (R.A.F. Il'T. Report) 6 # The Middle Euphrates. The situation is not quite so peaceful as might have been hoped for. Though Martial Law was rescinded at the end of July, it was nevertheless necessary to carry out two bombing raids towards the end of August and more troops and police have had to be moved into this area. Since it has also been impossible to get the leader Cha’ad ibn Shavian to surrender# even to the Prime Minister# it is probable that somewhat disturbed conditions will continue. He stated that he did not trust the promises of the Bliticians and obviously had visions of being cast straight into prison. (R.A.F. Int. Report) IRAQ . 7. German Trade irreement . The terms of the German treaty of Commerce have Just been published and in the main they are designed to apply the M most favoured nation treatment” to trade between the two countries.

With reference to paragraph 16 of the August Intelligence Peport# the Iranian Government have authorised the importation of the weaving plant and it is said that it is coming from the United Kingdom.

It is reported that with effect from 21st March 1937 the date trade will be under the Government Monopoly Law* (Khorramshahr Int.

Charge d'Affaires forwarded an official complaint to the Iranian Government and so far no reply has been received to this communication* From information received from H.B.M. Consul, Kerman, it would appear that the firing was done by Iranian Naval Motor Dhow No*l and that a Customs Inspector from Lingah was onboard at the time. Also, that no official report of the incident was made on return to harbour. (Correspondence with Political Resident) 11. Civil Aviation. With re erence to paragraph 34,36 and 36 of the June Intelligence Report, the three de Havilland Rapide machines have been taken over by the Iranian authorities though they have not as yet been fitted wit i their W/T apparatus. Three pilots have been selected, one has been in England for the past two years and is reported to be very good. The groind organisation is, however, in a very backward state. There are no W/T facilities or meteorological services and the landing grounds themselves require to be considerably improved. Mr de Havilland is of the opinion that the service could not possibly be inaugurated for another four months. The Minister pf Posts and Telegraphs has definitely stated that the Iranian Government was going to agree to reciprocal facilities for an Iraqi service to Tehran. (H.M. Charge d’Affaires, Tehran) 12. Corruption in the Ministry of Transport . During the recent clean up of the Staff of the Ministry, mine were condemned to varying terms of imprisonment up to three years and/~ N l and fined in addition and seven, including the Minister himself, were acquitted on charges of corruption and accepting hribes* (Le Messager) IS* Basidu . A naval detachment consisting of 1 Sergeant 1 N.C.O and 2 ratings are now stationed there, they are relieved by the gunboats at intervals of 2 - 3 months. Local trade is very poor, there is no market and they have not even got a boat to send off to ships, though this year the date and onion crops have been good. (”Bideford n ) Henj.^m . A naval detachment of 1 N.C.O. and 7 men is supplied from the gunboats who visit the place once a month* The gunboats take in fuel from an 150 ton lighter which is moored there, it being refilled as necessary from Abadan. There is now no communication with the outside world except for the telegraph line to Bunder Abbas, which is still in operation. The Police Force consists of 24 N.C.O's and men who are fairly smart looking. Henjam . 100 cases of blasting material are stored on the island for a Japanese firm who have obtained a salt concession near Khargu on Quishn Island in exchange for importing cement into Iran. Blasting operations are expected to start in October ('Bideford') IRANIAN NAVY * 15. The Floating dock. With reference to paragraph 30 of the July Intelligence Report, the Iranians are still not altogether happy about the moorings of the floating dock and there is some doubt as to whether they are strong enough to stand up to the strong winds and tides. It is now proposed to buy barges in Basrah, load them with stones and sink them in addition to the anchors. The fee charged by the Anglo-Ionian Oil Company for the use of the floating crane was 26,000 Rials (£325) /' ^ (Khorramshahr Int. Report). 16/16* Damming the Karun River* It 1 b reported that the Iranian Government has decided to dam the mouth of the Karun River and divert it into the Barmanshir Channel. It is unlikely that anything will happen for a long time owing to shortage of money. At present any surplus is 'being spent on the Trans-Iranian Railway and the next item on the list is the Commercial port at Banaar Shapur* (H.B.M. Consul# Ahwaz). 17. The Shah 1 s Yacht * With reference to paragraph 31 of the July Intelligence Report# Setwan I Daftari has been appointed in command of the Yacht which is for the Shah # s personal use in the Caspian Sea. He was formerly in command of the gunboat ”KARKAS M . He left for Tehran on 27th August. (Khorramshahr Int. Report) 18. B ehaviour ashore of the Iranian Sailors. An Iranian Petty Officer, in charge of the naval police# ran amok in \ Abadan and shot 8 people finally mortally wounding himself. Orders have now been given for all spare rifles end ammunition from the Iranian sloops to be stored at Khorromabad.

Health Officer boarded ship. Pratique granted. Landed one third class passenger. Stores landed - nil. Passengers ana stores embarked - nil. Proceeded.

On our arrival at Jask at 0700 on 1st October, the Port Health Officer came on board and granted pratique. No other ship was present. An officer then landed with the interpreter to ask the Governor at what time he would receive my call, and this was fixed for 1000. 12. I landed and walked to the Governor’s Office (on the ground floor of his house), which is about i mile from the landing place. There were no signs of the Iranian Navy in Jask. 13. The Governor had previously been reported to me as being the Governor of the Province. Actually he appears to be more in the nature of the Head Man of the 20 or 30 houses and mud huts which form the village of Jask, and I should say he ranks with the 'Deputy Governor” of Henjam. He is a man of about 40, bickers for precedence with the Chief of Police and Officer Commanding Troops ( a Second Lieutenant), and to judge by the appearance of his office and his one clerk he has not very much to do. 14 14. The Governor had not much to say beyond running down Jask, and I gather he has been given his present job on account of some misdemeanour. His return visit was fixed for 1700.CONFIDENTIAL Z95 LfiTTSE OF PKOCKiSDlNGS. 13th September to 2nd October, 1936 (' BIDSFORD 11 * s Wo« 2582/50 of 2nd October, 19561. 15. fthile ashore I met the Indian Manager of the Telegraph Station, who was formerly at Henjam, and on returning on board after my visit to the Governor I changed into plain clothes and landed to visit this Manager. He told me that Jas* is pretty dead ( a common cry in Iran nowadays) and that there is but little trac.e in or out* Taxes are almost prohibitive and these make the price of beer Rupees 3£ a bottle and whiskey Rupees 17 a bottle. In Jask itself with a population of about 300 people there are said to be 100 'police’*, including 19 soldiers and some customs officials. The date crop has been poor this year. Fhere are masses of fish in the harbour and a certain amount are salted and exported to China for food and to Germany for manure, but the trade is not very profitable. There are stringent laws against the importation ol foreign money, and 1 upees 60 is the maximum amount of Indian currency that may be imported by any one person. This made the purchase of carpets difficult for us. x x x x X 18. The Governor came off at 1700 in our motor boat accompanied (at my invitation) by the Manager of the Telegraphs He had nothing very much to say, except that he had been expecting the 'Charokh” (as had we). In accordance with your instructions I had asked the Governor with how many guns he wished to be saluted on leaving, and as he replied 'none” no salute was fired. 19. There are no Europeans in Jask and no question arose as to any form of entertainment on either side, so I decided to leave the following morning. 20. We therefore left Jask at 0600 on 2nd October x X x X X 21 21. In my opinion the so-called Governor of Jask holds a position far below that requiring an official call from a Captain, Royal fiavy. The man himself appeared to be surprised and embarrased by the formalities, and I strongly recommend that his status be enquired into before the Commanding Officer of th next British Sloop to visit Jask is placed in the rather unfortunate position in which I found myself by having to call on him (in Ho. 9 Dress). But apart from setting a bad precedent, I do not think much harm has been done, as there is no-one of sufficient calibre in Jask to appreciate the significance of ceremonial visits.CONFIDENTIAL H.M.8.

Accompanied by Major Ryan (Secretary to the Political Resident) and Mr.Pyman (the Vice-Consul), I called on His Excellency the Governor, M.Sadri, who has recently arrived from Kashan. He was courteous and friendly, but has neither the personality nor presence of his predecessor. He returned my call at the Secretary’s Residence. 6.

He has been on hoard twice and been very attentive and friendly. He proudly fired a salute of 1 gun (an omen which I did not explain to him! ) from a very old cannon with a pre-Trafalgar firing arrangement. The resulting explosion was good and# incidentally&gt; might have been better as it was fired in the direction of the petrol store* a building with no proper roof about 2C yards away! I explained that this honour could not be returned. At his request, I inspected the petrol stock. All the tins are very rusty, many are leaking, some being empty. I feel that Air Headquarters might be glad to know this as the Wall says that their condition is worse than on the last R.A.F. visit, and that the stock is diminishing rapidly. X x x x X 11. I was surprised, on passing Kumsar on the 24th, to see 4 large and about 10 medium sized dhows there. I couldn’t help feeling that a certain amount of intelligence may have leaked out from Muscat, and that they knew not only of our impending operation but also of its subsequent postponement. It will be interesting to see what happens if and when it is decided to repeat it. Since my return here, however, I learn that movements are taking place in the local population consequent on the end of the date season at Khassab, and that the rehabitation of Kumsar is due to this. This letter is probably the correct explanation. OLCONFIDENTIAL LETTER OF PROCEEDINGS, 1st - 15th SEPTEMBER 1936 ('DEPTFORD*e' No.56 of 15th Septemner 1J36). x X X X X INTELLIGENCE 16. The Supervisor at Khor Kuwai has had a visit from an old friend of hie at Sharjah. This man stated that there had been some trouble at Debai which included some slight incendiarism in Daira. A cousin of the Shaikh was responsible for this as a protest against his uncle*s lack of control there. The result appears to be that this man. Said bin Butti, has been made Wali of Daira with a view to his putting things right there. For this the Shaikh*s wife was largely responsible. He is reputed to be carrying out sweeping reforms which include:- (1) All prostitutes are ordered to get married or leave the town. (2) Householders are to keep the street in front of their houses clean. (3) Large parties have been employed clearing away rubbish dumps and generally improving the place. During our visit there in April - May, the latter was obviously desirable. 17. It is reported that the Shaikh of Debai has signed a contract with Major Holmes involving sevjn lacs of rupees for oil developaients at a place in Debai territory about 20 miles inland. The authority for this report is not necessarily accurate but it is of interest xf true. It is believed that a landing place for cargo is being made at the head of the lagoon.Admiralty, ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION tHOULD US A0DRE86C0 TO- TM* SRCRTTARY OF THE ADMIRALTY A THE FOLLOWING LETTER A NUMBER •MOULD 8E quoted;- ^0Ul.Ffti,^ao/36.

MUSCAT . Tribal fighting has been reported as taking place at Jaalan, 40 miles Northwest of Ras al Hadd between the Bani Booh and Bohsin. Nothing was known as to the cause of the dispute, or as to which side was winning. These tribes were formerly under the control of the Sultan of Muscat, this being at present ineffective, the Sheikhs look after their own interests (S.N.O., P.G.) 2* Customs Duty * In 1924 it was agreed that a ctuty of b% shouldbe levied on dry dates brought by the Omanis for export via Muscat ports. Recently, however, at Sur they have been charging duty amounting to 12&amp;. The Omanis have represented their case to the Sultan who has done nothing whatsoever about it, so now they are negotiating with the Sheikh of the Beni Bu Ali&gt; whose district is near Sur, to open a new port in his territory. Sheikh Hamad bin Sulairaan, the right hand man of the Imam of Oman, has also been sent to Muscat to discuss matters with Saiyid Shahab. ( Muscat Int. Report ). SMALLPOX 5. No outbreaks have been reported during the month on either the Trucial or the Batineh Coasts. (S.N.O., P.G.) KUWAIT. 7. Relations with Palestine . The Supreme Moslem Council continues to issue letters and telegrams asking for support, The latest to be received by the Kuwait Government calls upon' ali Moslems and all Arabs to do their duty towards the Holy Land ’’before it becomes a second Andalucia”. (Kuwait Int. Report). SAUDI-ARABIA . 8. Saudi Reactions to Palestine Disturbances. it is apparent that His Majesty Ibn Saud is taking a great interest in the situation in Palestine and that he fully appreciates that in his acknowledged position as the most powerful Arab Ruler, he is expected to take more than an academic interest in the struggle. His position is complicated in the extreme. As an Arab and a Muslem his sympathies must naturally lie with his friends and co-religionists who are engaged in this struggle with a Foreign Nation. As a statesman, he appreciates the unique position of Great Britain as the only European nation which has the Arab interests at heart. He further ap ^reciates that should he openly show sympathy with the Arabs in Palestine, they would at once misconstrue his intentions into that of support of their cause, a contingency which he wishes to avoid. He&lt;1o^ He is evidently considering the advisability of associating himself with the struggle in the role of raediator f but before committing himself to any definite policy, he is anxious to sound His Majesty’s Government for an indication as to the degree to which they are prepared to accede to the Aral requests. It is possible that, if he can satisfy himself that there is a likelihood of these requests receiving favourable consideration, he will advise the insurgents to submit to the British demand for the complete restoration of law and order before the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire into the alleged grievances of the Arabs. The king realises that the two essential points which must form the minimum basis of negotiation are (i) The Control of the Jewish immigration. (ii) A more equitable partition of the land. While obviously desirous of putting an end to this unprofitable and unfortunate struggle, the King wishes to avoid the danger of pressing the Arab cause to the extent of jeopardising the amicable relations which exist between Great Britain and £audi-Arabia. (R.A.P. Int. Report). 1KA . . Reftcticms in Iraq to Palestine Disturbances . Owing to the very rigid press censorship imposed by the Gov rnment, the accounts of the disturbances have merely been extremely inaccurate and ’heir bitterness has had to be toned down. There is, however, little doubt that the sympathy of the Iraqis as a nation lies with their racial brothers in Palestine. However, as all forms of demonstrations are banned by the Government, there is little chance of the ex tremists stirring up anti-British or anti-Jewish demonstrations The Jewish community, nevertheless, take good cure to keep on the right side of their Moslem neighbour by contributing to the Palestine Relief Fund when called upoiyto do go. Bo far 1.2).7112 have been collected of which I.D.6109 have been remitted to Palestine. (R.A.F. Int. Report).K/fr.I.D.0780/36 SECRET EXTRACTS FROM THE PERSIAN GULF INTELLIGENCE REPORT FOR THE MONTH OB AUGUST, 1936. 10. The Situation on the Middle and Lower Euphrates . Martial Law was rescinded on 29th July, thus leaving the Government freer to concentrate on plans for the development of the country. A deputation of the dissatisfied tribal leaders from the Middle Euphrates were granted, an interview by the Prime Minister, who attempted to conciliate them by pointing out that the Government were genuinely trying to improve their lot. He enumerated the provisions in the 3 and 3 year Capital Works Plan which affected their districts. He further pointed out to them that while their districts remained so unsettled, it was impossiblefbr the Government to put their schemes for improvements into operation. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 11. The Settlement of the Assyrians . The Ghab Scheme has now entirely broken down, this is largely due to an official pronouncement by the French Government that, owing to political development in Syria, it would, in their view, be unwise to proceed with the plan. Meanwhile the League have tried to get the Iraq Government to break the news to the Assyrians, this they have very naturally declined to do, asas they do not see why the League should get all the credit for announcing good news, and they, all the kicks for publishing the had news. Until a solution is found, the Iraq Grovernment have guaranteed the safety of those Assyrians who remain in Iraq* (R.A.F. Int* Report). 12. Conscription . It has become increasingly difficult to collect the conscripts in any part of the country. At a Cabinet Meeting which was held, it was decided not to push conscription too hard in any district, pending the re assembly of Parliament. It is understood that in the meanwhile, two inspectors have been appointed, one for the north and one for the south, to investigate the problem. Difficulty will be experienced very shortly in maintaining a sufficient supply of recruits for the Amy Expansion Scheme. (R.A.P. Int. Report). 13. Civil Aviation . With reference to paragraph 34 of the June 1936 Summary, it is understood that the Nairn Transport Company are in the course of completing arrangements whereby they will receive a small subsidy from the Government and will b£ the only Company allowed to operate an air service within Iraq. On the satisfactory conclusion of this agreement they will operate a bi-weekly service between Baghdad and Damascus with a possible extension to Haifa; a bi-weekly service from Baghdad to Basrah, connecting with the Damascus aircraft and possibly a weekly service between Baghdad and Mosul. The aircraft will be either Stinson or Lockheed. (E.A.F. Int. Report). X X X X IRAN . 15. The Governor of Bushire. Aqai Ahmad Sadri, the new Governor of the Southern Ports, Bushire, has taken up his appointment. He comes of the Isfahan family of Sadr-i- Isfahani who was Prime Minister of Shah Husain, the last monarch of the Safavi dynasty. He is about 55 years of age and has been Governor of several towns in the interior. He was once a judge in Tehran and his last appointment^as at Kashan. He knows no European language, but he knows Turkish having been born in Tabriz. (Bushire Int. Report) 16. Weaving Business . At the end of last month Aqa Husain I’atimad of the firm Haji Ali Akbar visited Bushire and announced his intention of installing a weaving plant for weaving white shirting and sateen. Local merchants have welcomed the suggestion and have offered to bu£ shares in the plant. It is also strongly backed by the new Governor who has sent to Tehran asking that every facility may be provided. If it materialises, this new enterprise will probably supplant the idea of the formation of a Steam Navigation Company which was strongly backed by the last Governor. (Bushire Int. Report). 17 17, Relationsi V 17. Relations with Turkey . His Majesty Reza Shah sent a^ message of congratulation to liis Excellency Kemal Atature * when the Dardanelles Convention was signed, this brought forth a suitable response. There is no doubt that Reza Shah is doing Everything he can to keep up the cordial relations that now exist with Turkey. (Le Mesaager). 18. Military . It is reported that the Iranian Govern ment have ordered 5000 copies of maps of Iran, which are printed i n India and Turkey. They are mainly detailed maps of the Iraqi-Iranian Frontier, and are said to be 1 inch to 1 mile. Some of them were compiled by the International Commission which delimited the Turko-Persian Frontier in 1913-1914, and show only the Frontier zone. The purpose of obtaining these maps is said to be:- (a) To acquaint their own officials with the actual Iranian Frontier as claimed by the Iranian Government and with the existing Frontier line. (b) To enable officers and officials to study the area and to be acquainted with it in the event of hostilities between Iraq and Iran, in the event of the failure of the present diplomatic negotiations between the two countries. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 19. Iranian Navy . It is reported that by the order of the Shah, four high Government officials accompanied by one of the Dutch engineers visited Bandar Shapur with a view to submitting their final report on the Floating Dock to him. It is also rumoured that the Government have placed an order for a tug of 1500 h.p. and a crane lighter cppable of lifting 60 tons. (Khorramshahr Int. Report). 20. Movements.

The reason given is that the Government anticipates a recrudescence of the tribal unrest next Spring and desires vessels which can be constructed in time to take part in its suppression. 9« I was informed that,, to suit the convenience of the Bahrain Oil Company, the routine of the subsidiary Mall Steamers has been changed, so that these steamers will run to Basra and Kovelt alternately on opposite weeks to the present schedule. This is so that connection may more conveniently be made with the American Export line which runs fortnightly ita Beyrout and Haifa. The information was receivsd verbally from the Manager of Mespers. BARBRA which was on the Koweit run came in to Basra last week, and I understand this marksd the commencement of the change. the Oil Company’s tugs, the Iranian Floating Dock has, after six weeks work, been finally moored in the Xhor Maramus at Bandar Shapur. Barracks at Bait al Falak showed them to be up to full strength of 160 and greatly improved in bearing and physique. Extensive Improvements in recreational facilities are being carried out, which include a cricket ground, running track, and new hocjrey ground. The rifle range is being modernised. MUSCAT A visit to Captain Byard at the Muscat Levies In•'N In addition, the limited water supply ia heing fully utilised for fertilising extensive allotments which the men mam are working. His irrigation scheme is a real work of art. My general impression was that the esprit de corps and efficiency of the Leview had increased enormously since my last visit, their cheerfulness helng most apparent. Captain Byard said that, although they were not yet fully trained for active service, he hoped that they soon would he and furthermore would he thus employed when necessary. At present the general Impression seems to he that the Sultan prefers to use them for show and not for fighting. He is finding it difficult to get funds for such comforts as electric power, refrigerator, etc. KHASSAB. 24. It is reported that a large number of women are spending the summer at Khassah, having come up from the Trucial Coast while their men are away pearling. Its popularity as a holiday resort is said to he due to the existence of a better and sweeter water supply, and the comparative cheapness of commodities, particularly fish and dates. Apparently the presence of 100 able bodied men at Khor Kuwai has no influence on this influx. SH1HUH. 25. Although the local tribesmen are very Interested in our operations at Khor Kuwai and are said to resent the possible interference with their liberty, they are not expected to carry out any active counter measures as they realise a sloop is either present or can and may appear at short notice. Also they have found out that when building operations are over, the '•foreign inva8ion ,, on such a large scale will disperse. This information comes to the ears of the Supervisor through the local fishing craft which supply the coolies. x X X Xsacitai. EXTRACTS FROM THE PERSIAN OUL^”INTjSLL10ENC^ REPORT COVERING THE MONTH OF JULY 1936. ^ • i MUSCAT » U VJ vJ I Ahmad ”bin Mohamed, ^heil^ arrived in Muscat on the 2nd June to ask on behalf of the Bani Haddiyeh, a section of the Shihuh tribe, for the release of Sheikh Hassan of Khassab who has been under detention since 1S30 for aaving twice rebelled against the Muscat Government. Saiyid Shahab refused to release him with6ut the Sultan’s consent. (Muscat Int. Report.). 4* Khor Fakkan . During the early part of May an Iranian dhow from Bunder Abbas was shot up and plundered by a party of 12 armed Baluchis whilst at anchor in Khor Fakkan. The Nakhoda wrote to the Commander of the Iranian Naval Forces complaining of these acts. The latter has replied that the names and places of residence of the Baluchis are required, also that proof of guilt must be furnished before he will take action. (Letter from P.R.) X X X X GWADUR. 6. Travellers from Iranian Baluchistan state that the country is at present in a very disturbed state. The Baluch Sirdars are reported to be fighting amongst themselves and the Iranian authorities seem at present quite unable to cope with the situation. (Muscat Int. Report). TRUCIAL COAST . 7. From reports from local dhows it appears that the pearling season has been very successful. The pearls have been plentiful and of a good quality. S.N.O., P.G.). 8# Small-pox . No outbreaks have been reported during the past month either on the Trucial coast or the Batineh Coast. (S.N.O., P.G.) X X X X SAUDI-ARABIA . 11. Aviation . Italy is apparently interested in aviation in Saudi-Arabia. The Italian Government has under taken to present six aeroplanes to the Saudi Government, three for training purposes and three for civil use. The gift has been represented as being inspired solely by Italy’s interest in the development of aviation, to which she has already contributed by training the Saudi students. The offer was accepted - 'in order not to offend the Italians” - and three instructional aircraft arrived in cases from Massawa on ^;9th May. (R.A.F. Int. Report)12* Saudl-Iraq-Yemen Relations * With reference to paragraph 15 of the May Intelligence Report, the King of the Yemen has appointed a committee to study and report on the Iraq-Saudi treaty and is sending representatives to Iraq and Squdi-Arabia to discuss points arising out of it. (Aden Int. Report). 13. Annual Tribute . Ibn Saud summoned all the chieftains with their best followers to meet him at the end of June; normally this visit takes place in July. He was particularly gracious to everyone and gave larger bounties than usual. This has naturally given rise to a crop of rumours, such as that he is preparing for a cam paign in the Yemen, or going to assist in Palestine. It is, however, much more probable that he is only tightening his hold over his fickle Nejdi subjects, as should the Palestine affair continue into the Autumn after the great heat is over, they may be somewhat difficult to control. (Kuwait Int. Report). KUWAIT . 14. Relations with Palestine . His Excellency the Ruler received a request from leaders in Palestine for a subscription to help on the rebellion. This he refused to give, but it nevertheless seems probable that a small sum of money has been collected in Kuwait and forwarded through Iraq. No Bedouin movements have so far taken place and it is unlikely that-they will do so Report). 15. Trade. Japanese cement is rivalled at the moment by a German brand which sells at one anna per bag cheaper. This brand is labelled in English as 'Best Portland Cement”, the German name on the reverse side of the bag being that of the bag manufacturer. It was found on enquiry that it was shipped by F. Undutsch &lt;fc Co. Bremen. Cement is being used in ever increasing quantities as it is cheaper and more effective than the local gypsum. 17. Home Politics, The elopsnent of Princess Azzar, a sister of King Ghazi, with a Greek waiter has had very damaging effect on the King f s prestige. In addition cer tain irregularities in the Palace life were brought into prominence; it is indeed doubtful whether the King will ever be fully rehabilitated in the eyes of the strict Moslems. All this has in no way helped on the settlement of the Middle Euphrates dispute. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 18. Middl e Euphrates Situation . At the beginning of June there' whs s f r&amp;B on Lb peak On the part of shaikh Sha * alan3/0 ♦ Sha’alan al Attiyah of the Shahhanah section of the Aqrah. It was, however, ill-timed and of no assistance to the Bani Huchaim. Had it been a month or so earlier it would have caused the Government considerable inconvenience. At present the situation is that in spite of the Government's official announcements that peace has been restored, Martial Law continues in operation and throughout the month the military tribunal at Diwaniyah has been in constant session. Up to date it is estimated that forty deaths sentences have been passed of which thirty have been carried out and various terms of imprisonment passed on over 200 other people. His Majesty was extremely reluctant to give the royal assent to these executions and, until his own family affairs diverted his interests, refused to sign the warrants. He was, however, finally persuaded by his Ministers and no time was lost in putting the sentences into effect at Diwaniyah and Dagharah where the executions took place in public on a specially constructed ’’five noose” gallows. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 19. Reactions to Palestine Disturbances . During the month of June the local press has shown consistent interest in Palestine. Palestine affairs; comment has been anti-British in tone, but really virulent Press attacks have not been so frequent as was to be expected. At the same time, the topic of the position of the Palestinian Arabs is a universal one and even the most moderate opinions expressed condemn the British policy, while the Nationalist and pan- Arab groups openly advocate more direct assistance. That there has been no sympathetic demonstrations can be attributed to the attitude of the Prime Minister, who although supporting the protests a ainst the treatment of the Arabs in Palestine, has banned all forms of open demonstration. The continuance of fighting in Palestine, however, appears to be intensifying the sympathetic feeling of Iraq and no guarantee can yet be given that public opinion will not express itself in some more violent form. (R.A.F. Int. Report). 20 * 22 20. Bon of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah . Sheikh Abdul Majid has escapeci from Tehran and is now in Basrah. The. Iranians have demanded his return, but the matter is under discussion. (*Deptford* Int. Report). IRAN 22. Communications. On the 29th June the Shah officially opened the new telegraph line between Tayebatt and Djanatabad, this connects Iran to Afghanistan. It has taken two months to complete. (Le Messenger).3fl 23 » B»lo Calls at Henjam . With reference to paragraph 28 of April Intelligence Report, though approval was obtained to cease calling at Ken^am after 1st August, nevertheless it is observed from the new B.I* programme that all B.I. slow maiii will continue to call there at any rate up till the beginning of January. (S.N.O., P.G.). 24 . Bushlre W/T Station . With reference to paragraph 30 of the April Intelligence Report, this station has been uoved to a position two miles east of the Airport. An Iranian officer and a French engineer have been employed on the job, they hope to complete in October this yea”. xhis error in siting has cbbx cost the Iranian Government £1,250. T ^ T') /'Nvi 4* » 25. Smuggling. This continues practically unchecked,^ the Amnieh (Road Guards) are so corrupt that it is reported that they will be disbanded and replaced by conscripts. It is reported that the sloop BABR chased 5 smugglers dhows into Port Teben, but the water was too shallow for her to reach them. They were subsequently fired by a Customs Launch, but not before the cargo ha^ been carried off inland, (Bushire Int. Report). 26. Local Conditions . The peasantry are reported to be recovering from their losses due to the drought in 1931-33, and this year they nave had a bumper harvest. The shopkeepers are, however, in a poor plight, as with the increase in smuggling, none of the peasantry come into Bushire to make any purchases. (Bushire Int. Report). 27, Abadan - Smuggling . There has been a considerable amount of smuggling in currency going on between Seeba and Abadan, it being possible to get 105 Rials for £1 as opposed to the normal 80. Certain A.I.O.C. officials were involved. The Customs did not wish to bring the case too far into ■he daylight as all the bribes to Customs Officials were s^own in the books. Thus the matter was allowed to rest with the A.I.O.C. discharging one European and one Indian clerk, against whom it was proved that tney had sold foreign exchange to private persons. 28 28. Trade and Exchange Restrictions . Legislation has recently been pas seel in Iran limiting the sale of foreign exchange for imports from those countries with which Iran has an adverse trade balance. This should not affect British Trade as exports and imports almost balance if the export of gold ingots imported for the Iranian Government are excluded. The countries whose trade will suffer include Japan, who imports only one sixth of the value she exports to Iran. (R.A.F. Int. Report).VI OIL INTERESTS. 34.

The Bheikh of water has started ne{ 70 tiating with the Huler of Bahrain for a plot of ground on ; an-unah for a _ house.

The failure of their ill-advised decision to stamp out the Middle Euphrates unrest by force of arms has resulted in considerable embarrassment and has put other ^vernment activities much into the background. {O.F.

Alter tuat, however, the situation deteriorated, punitive operations were brought to a standstill and the attitude of the'neighbouring tribes, and Shia's feelings in general, indicatea that the government had stirred up a hornet's nest which they found difficult to smoke out and could not leave unsettled without serious loss of prestige. hesort was at once made to the vicious practice of bribery in order to keep potential enemies cut of the fray, and towards the ena of the month the Cabinet was as^ea to sane lion a large sum, stated to be as much as 1.1).180,000 ior this purpose, it being admitted at the tiiue that the major portion had already been spent. This policy has been successful for the time being and idespread revolt has been averted; but naturally demands for hunk money become more numerous and more exorbitant, and a limit must at some time be reached when this fom of settlement a more w must be abandoned. (K.A.i. I.R.) 14. Another unfortunate cabinet decision was tke delegation of complete control of the conduct of repressive operations to General Dakr 8idqi. This distinguished oo.;:r»and».r ap ears to have lived up to his reputation for brutality and many tribesmen, apart from those actually killed in action, have apparently lost their lives. He was the General who was responsible for the Assyrian Massacres in 1933. The method of massacring all and sundry, though quite satisfactory in the case of small minorities, has brought forth widespread protests when applied to brother Arabs* The agitators have not been slow to use the reports of these atrocities as arguments to turn the issue from one of the suppression of a local revolt to the ever-present animosity between Shia ana ounni. and Opposition politicians in Baghdad have naturally seized the op ortunity to air their righteous indignation. (R.A.r. I.R.) 15. In the meantime, the present Cabinet remains in officeThe Opposition has been loud-roiced for a change, but after^ revierin^ the drab collection who might take over the administration, little confidence can be expressed that a change would be an improvement* In any case, the present Prime kinister is reluctant to resi&lt;*£i when internal affairs are so unsettled and the only other ^ possible candidate* who mij ! t be able to fit the post with a fair prospect of success, namely kuri as ba* ict appears to have made an intelligent appreciation 01 the situation and is diplomatically deferring his return from Europe, much to the chagrin of his numerou clientele who have been busy earmarking the most lucrative and least arduous posts for themselves. (K.A.f. 1*H*} 16. In contrast to the personal influence exerted by King Feisal, His Lajesty has flayed no part cither as a mediator or as a airector of policy in the present dispute* reputations deploring the 'Governments actions and others extolling its firmness have been received at the Palace, but King (xbaai has maintained a disinterested attitude and appears content to trust his i: inist. rs to find a solution without any interference on his part. This aloofness has proved a Genuine disappointment to the older and more sioderate elements, who in the past were accustomed to look to t v e Palace for guidance in time© of crisis.

In continuation of paragraph 20 of the Intelligence Report of May 1936, the Amy by virtue of its superior numbers wa? successful in its initial encounters up to the Btn May when the railway embankiiusn t was secured and pi eke tied* Since this d#te, however, they have been able to achieve very little and have net followed up their earlier successes. The brutalities committed have not caused the tribesmen to melt away, in fact tbuir resistance has beer stiffened. As was only to be expected some of the conscript units have displayed marked instability in action. ^ J (R./Ui. I.R.) 18. Up to the 8th May the Mr *orce carried out several bombing attacks ana more bombs were purchased from Royal Air Force stocks* The following week was not so successful, two machines being shot down; it appears that they disobeyed their instructions and came down below 3000 feet to carry oat the attacks and in one case V \e p i 1 o t had re cse i vad a su re ie c ; as t wound . Following on this t ree Dragons and one Hawker aircraft were eevenij dam .red by a storu when picketted out in the open* A most creditable effort in repairing aircraft in the field ensued, and with the help of the British technical cadre attached to the Iraqi Air i'orce, all these aircraft were arain in service five days later. » 19. The combination of the standstill on the -round and of the obvious deterioration of the Air Force 1 s morale, owing to its losses in action and through stormy weather, were posribly the deciding arguments which caused tne # government to change its policy from one in which the determination towards complete suppression by military action was predominating to one of compromise* /ThisThis new policy put into practice on 13tfe May was adopted after it was abundantly clear that Teelinf amonfUBt neighbouring’ tribes had reached a dangerous level and {hat, unless military action within the limits of active op osition was immediately successful, it was orobable that participating action would be apparent in adjoining districts. (B.A.F* I.R.) 2C. The Government have nsineci nothing by this respite as the rebels are demanding more than the GoveHiraert are prepared to ?Tive ? ri hence no settle tent has nec;n arrived at. In fact during the last ten days of &amp;ay after the expiration of the truce, the rebels resumed their snipin^ activities and the only success that the Government can claim is chat tie railway is stil Open. It has been virtually established that the armed forces of the Government are not competent to mtet op osition on a generous scale. It is at present riifiioult, therefore, to foresee now, with both sides holding out for their own terms an early solution is to be reached, but it stems improbable that the issue will be decided by military action. (R.A.l. 1. .) 21. Reaction* to Palestine lieturbanees. As ia t :e custom whenever disturbances occur in neighbouring Arab countries there has been &amp; sustained press campaign in Iraq attacking the British policy in Palestine and urging sympathetic action, poilowing precedent, collections have been msde for tl eir afflicted brethren across the desert, but it is not known how great a percentage, if any, of the subscriptions have reached their decunfetions. (R .A .h » 1« v «) 8?. Proposals have been mace, chiefly at tre instigation of thoso profs.svional arttstorr w^o are s feature of Iraq’s capital, to hold &amp;ass demonstrations in support of the Arab cause in Palestine, but up to t&gt;e present, the Govtromeat has maintained a strictly correct attitude in reRDecting the difficulfciss of its ally eno las e-ta orictllv refused to allow &amp;ay public demonstrstions (c.A.i. I.H.) 23. Sauerally speaking there is no national feeling in this country and efforts to excite universal participation in any cause other than a domestic one are normally neither comprehensive or lasting. At present, interest is centred on the Piddle Euphrates situation end the cabinet changes which i&amp;ay reauit from it, and it is not thought that any serious disturbance will be staged on the excuse of events iq Pyles tine, ihe fact, however, should not be overlooked that, if the present restraint is removed, anti- British demonstrations in Baghdad might follow.

It is reported that the garrison of Ahwaz with the exception cf a care and maintenance party has been moved into the Pusht-I-Kuh and Lizful areas. In view of reliable reports that the Bakhtian and other tribes in Luristen are in a state cf revolt, it is probable that this movement of troops is to maintain security in those areas. The causes of the trouble are reperted to be the 'uafur' law abolishing the purdah and the general interference by the ‘Government in the social and economic life of the people, which does not find favour with the tribes of Both era Iran, who at the best of times are mors Arab than Iranian.

This question was actually discussed previously with the Political Agent at Kuwait who said that ha did not know/any such traffic. reported to be:- (a ) The conscription laws which are now being put into force in Iraq to bring the country into line in that respect with Turkey and Iran, and(b) A report circulated among the Bhi'aha that antiques such as old swords and daggers are to be confiscated from their 'prophets' and placed in the museum at Baghdad.

The import of raw materials, viz., wool grain and mate from the interior into Gwadur is reported to he decreasing every day. This is due to (a) the establishment of Customs posts by the Kalat State on the frontier, (b) to the increased customs duty levied by the Muscat State and (c) to the payment of the cost of goods in Gaz, a local copper currency which is not current in the Mekran and which causes importers to lose two annas in a rupee on exchange. (Muscat I.R.) Bel*ah . With reference to paragraphs P of the March and April Intelligence Reports, it has now been fairly definitely established that the murderer was Abdullah bin Salem of the Shihuh tribe; it is therefore proposed that the Sultan^ representative should demand that he be sent to Muscat for trial. As the authority of the Sultan over the Shihuh tribe is not great, it seems to be probable that the demand will be refused, in which case somewhat stronger action may have to be taken. XXX 6. Smallpox . The Trucial Coast was reported to be free from smallpox on 16th May, but this state lasted for only one day as, on the 17th May, fourteen cases were reported at Ras A1 Khaimah. Umm al Quwain has now about fourteen cases but the Trucial Coast Medical Officer is not declaring it an infected port. Batineh Coast is reported to be afflicted; the Medical Officer’s report has not yet been received. BAHRAIN . 7. On 18th - 19th April there was a ’’rough house” at the Bahrain American Petroleum Co. Camp, in the course of which the Resident Manager was assaulted and several people were injured, fortunately none very seriously. The Political Agent’s help was invoked by the Company and Special Constables were appointed, also a strong body of Bahrain Police under the Commandant (Mr. C.D. Belgrave) was stationed on the outskirts of the camp. On ??5rd and ?4th April the Political Agent held a judicial enquiry with the result that the four ring-leaders who were British (Tyne-siders) , were ordered to leav*=&gt; the Island by the mail steamer sailing the next day. There has been no sign of any further trouble, and it seems well to emphasise that there are no indications of trouble between the American and British personnel. Indeed the Political Ag^nt has received representations from the remaining British personnel expressing disgust at the conduct of the few men concerned, and requesting him to take action in the matter in order to safeguard the good name of British labor on the Island.

With reference to paragraph 6Cb) of the Intelligence report for April, 1936, no cancellation has yet appeared in the Press of the notice issued by the Director of Tapu, Basra, in the Basra newspaper rt An Nas on 31st March. The settlement of the question is the subject of correspondence between the authorities concerned. (Kuwait I.R.) 10, The Kuwait Oil Company presented the Sheikh with four new Ford V. B’s which have been locally adapted for use as armoured cars. They will replace the four former armoured cars which are now no longer serviceable. This presentation was made to mark the signing of the Oil Company’s agreement. (Kuwait I.R.) 11. Relatione with Saudi Arabia . An enquiry was received from the Saudi Court asking if the Sheikh would permit th* landing and transit of eleven Ford cars duty free. The Sheikh replied that he would be pleased to do so as they were for the personal use of His Majesty, Bin Saud. Following this a very friendly letter was received from Bin Saud. making a present of all the cars to the Sheikh and his relations. This was to be some return for the hospitality previously enjoyed by the s^udi Court, and to make up for any shortcomings there might have been in the previous presents. (Kuwait I.R.) SAUDI ARABIA . IP. It is reported that Bin Saud in conversation with Mr. Philby and others in his majlis at Urhairah, while commenting on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, had stated that as Great Britain had not assisted Abyssinia, he was of the opinion that Great Britain was weak. (Bahrain I.R.) 13. Air Communications . The French Government has announced its intention of presenting Bin Saud with an aeroplane, and the Saudi Government is contemplating the purchase of two more trsining aircraft, as the 8 students who went to Italy last year to learn to fly are expected back shortly. The King is contemplating opening an Air Mail service between Jedda and Riyadh, this would also serve to keep the pilots in regular training. (R.A.F. Int. Report’ 14. Attempt on life of Bin Baud . It is reported that an attempt was made on the life of Bin Saud at Riyadh during the past month. According to the Bazaar seven people were involved, five of whom have been shot and the remaining two are awaiting court-martial. 15- SAUDI - IRA£ - YEMEN RELATIONS . It is said that the Iraqi and Saudi Arabia governments have invited the King of the Yemen to accede to the treaty of friendship recently concluded between them. The King is said to be considering the matter. (Aden I.R.) IRAQ . 16. Irao-Saudl Treaty . With reference to paragraoh 39 of last summary, the 'law for th^ ratification of the Iraqi- Saudi Arabia Treaty of Alliance passed through both houses with enthusiastic approbation. 17 17. Iraq railways . The Bill for the transference of Iraq railways from British to Iraqi ownership passed through both housee with Httleop^^git^^^ though caustic comments wep€made about some clauses. Objections were che^ raised to the provisions that maintained Britis %fly raised sh officials in the key positions for the next twenty y^ars; certain members assuring the House that the Iraqis were no whit behind their British allies in technical and administrative ability. (R.A.F. Int.Report) 18. Iraq - Iran Frontier Negotiations . No progress has been made towards a settlement of these protracted negotiations, and a temporary suspension of the conversations has been agreed to, but it was emphasised in official circles that mutual good-will remained strong. In the meanwhile, the new Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs who, as Minister in Baghdad, was the chief Iranian delegate in the negotiations, has settled into office in Teheran and is continuing the discussions thrbugh diplomatic channels. 19. Unrest on the Middle Euphrates . It at first appeared probaile that peace would reign amongst the Shia tribes during the summer, as there was every prospect of a burrmer harvest. However, owing to the failur® of the government to handle the tribes as tactfully as the situation demanded, trouble broke out towards the end of April. The main causes of the revolt are as follows (a) The flooding of the crops due to the refusal of the governn^it to allow the Euphrates to be breached below ^madi, thus allowing the flood waters to escape into the desert. (b) The attempt to enforce conscription on the tribes. (c) The attempt to force the local tribesmen to wear the Sidara and European coat and trousers instead of their time honoured costume. (d) The Government orders curtailing the Muharrara PI. This revolt has caught the Iraq Government at a very awkward moment as they are still in the transition stage from a volunteer to a conscript army, and it cannot be said that conscription is a popular measure. (R.A.F. Int.Report) P?• Reactions to Palestine Disturbances . Sympathy for the Arab cause has been expressed only in the press and no active demonstrations or Jew baiting have taken place. One or two articles have appeared in the local newspapers criticising the British administration and lack of impartiality in the dispute, but, for the most part, recent events in Palestine have been used as an additional argument for pressing on towards the goal of unity amongst all the Arabic speaking nations, which ambition is receiving ever v increasing attention in pronouncements by politicians and \ in the press.

They consider it heretical and sacrilegious, but owing to th^ strength of the Central Government, they dare not give vent to their feelings. (Bushire I.R.) Emigration of Khuzistan tribes into Iraq . The Iranian Government is reported to be considerably pertrubed over the emigration of large sections of their Arab frontier tribes into Iraq, as it will decrease their revenue from the Koda and other taxes. In view of the known desire of many others to follow their example, the Iranian Government has taken strict steps to stop this exodus and has reinforced the frontier posts. (R.A.F.Int.Report) 96, Smuggling . This is still being actively carried on from all ports into the interior. In Bushire a month*s captures only amounted to seven bales of piece goods, two bags of tea, three donkey loads of tobacco and one mound of opium* It is reported from the Bazaar that many Iranian dhows are now taking wheat and sheep to Bahrein and purchasing cotton piece goods and tea to smuggle back into Iran. 557 • Outlaws . Banditry still continues in the vicinity of Bushire and in the orovince of Tangistan* An attempt was made irwease the Road Guards by calling up the Customs Guard*. but as they were only offered 70 Rials as against the 90 they formerly received, the majority refused to serve and were disbanded. (^ushire I.R.) Japanese arrested . Ihiring the first week of April Mr. Massouda, a partner of the Japanese Portland Cement Co., Osaka, and representing other Japanese firms, who had come to Iran some two months ago to negotiate business, was arrested by the Police authorities at Bushire for having two pieces of stone from P^rsepolic in his portmanteau. He alleges that he bought them from a vorkman for 10 Rials.

Most of this opium is exported over the U.S.S.R. border for the Far East, thus giving the U.S.S.R. a strong hold over Iran, opium being one of the mein sources of revenue.

Trade at Debai is very slack and reports all over the coast indicate that pearling is all they do seriously now, and that is not what it was. ^he once rich men are losing large sums of money yearly. One man I spoke to at A^aan said he was losing anything up to Rs.15,000 a year. ^he 'small season' has started and the traffic in dhows all along the coast is most noticeable 18. Whilst at Ajman information came to the ship that a raid had taken place a few days earlier by Bedouins who had taken off several slaves. The shaikh was away in the desert dealing with the situation. Also, whilst there, a letter came off to the Shaikh’s secretary who was on board to say that there was a strong rumour ashore that Ajman had been handed over to the British. This rumour apparently started when a letter arrived from the Political Resident asking that geologists might prospect in the district, and it was intensified by our arrival demanding to interview on board one of the richest old men in the . townIll 19. The Shaiich of Debai aaiced if it would be possible to put two buoys off the town, one to mark the anchorage and one the entrance to the lagoon. As the latter is always changing I suggested that that should be a local undertaking, but I think that the former would be of assistance not only to his craft but also to the B.T. ships that call there. The Master of the 'BANKURA', when she called at night, asked me to show a light for him to come incn. 20. Persia . A great number of the better constructed houses in ebai belong to merchants of south Persia who have left their own country on account- of dissatisfaction with the methods of government. 1 he population of both I'ebai and Sharjah has increased considerably during the last few years for the same reason. The south Persians are strongly resenting the fact that all petty officers for the Navy are drawn from North Persia instead of from South Persia where the men are natural sailors by force of circumstance and geographical position; it is they who navigate and man all the sea-going dhows to and from all Persian ports. They also consider that Italian (or other/other foreign) instructors should be brought to Persia to form a school of navigation rather than that Persian petty officers should be sent to Italy for instruction as at present carried out. 21. Arabian opinions of International affairs, . on international affairs to the ShaiKhs I have met. One has to watch one’s step, but there is no question that, however badly we may have come out of recent political exchanges (and they are disappointed that we could not do more for the Abyssinians in spite of the most careful explanation of the machinery of collective action) local opinion on the Trucial Coast is still very pro British as opposed to any other country. their Syrian policy, and the following storfes which they firmly believe, govern their opinion of (l) the Italians and (2) the Germans (l) In the early days of Italian colonisation of Tripoli or Libya, some recalcitrant natives were taken up in an aeroplane and dropped out over the village It has been very interesting to met to talx They don’s trust or like the French owing to where/119 where they were suppoBed to have conmitted their crimes, which were apparently of no serious nature, (2) In Tanganyika, in the days of German occupation, a German officer was walking down the street of a town and, in accordance with the local rules, all the rstives stood to attention except one who was stone blind and ’'hadn't heard the pipe'. The German officer returned and asked him why he had not stood up, but the excuse that he was blind and no one had told him the officer was passing did not prevent him from receiving 150 lashes. It is interesting to ponder over the effect of incidents such as these and the repercussions they have on the opinion of thousands of ^rabs. It is also a warning to us not to give any possible cause for similar censure. At present we are verypopular, and they think we are the greatest nation in the world especially in our treatment of natives in our colonies. • • •Doha, 17th May 2m Having received orders “to taite 'the Acting Political Agent, Captain Hicicinbotham, to Doha and Kaiba, I went ashore on the morning of sailing, i.e. the 16th Way, to discuss the programme with him. 6m #6 sailed at I860 with the Political .agent, his interpreter, and two Parrashs, ror Doha. -^he weather was good with clear visibility which made Doha easy to find, and we anchored at 0915. 4, As there had been no opportunity to warn the Shaiich of our arrival he was not in the town when we arrived. His son came to call, however, and said that his father, who was too tame to come on board, would be gxad to receive us at his palace later. this he did in the afternoon. 5. After compliments the two points for discussion came up, i.e. the colour and design o^. the Qatar flag, and the suggestion that the 3haikh should purchase some 1918 British rifles. -i-he xormer too]£ no time, but in the latter no success was met with. The Shaikh’s fancy had already been captured by a 1934 Mauser firing a larger bullet a greater distance, and costing verylittle more than our second-hand article. Even/( 143) 2*f| A Even the difficulty of ammunition supply in time of war which we could guarantee for our rifles, did not deter him from choosing the better and more powerful weapon. ^he doctor treated him for his leg which was badly swollen round the Knee. Kalba 19th - 20th May 12. During our stay the Doctor treated several cases of a minor nature and we made arrangements to convey to Bahrain a man who had had his arm badly broken by a camel bite. However, on further thought, he decided he would rather die at home and refused to come with us. • •• ... ... ... ... Iraq . The following are extracts from letters received by my interpreter’s wife. One of the pilots killed in the aeroplanes mentioned was a relation of hers. Information was received that the tribes of Diwaniyah and Rumaitha in Iraq, removed thd railway line for three days, so troops were sent to punish them. The troops, however, were punished by the tribes. Eventually more troops and ’planes arrived and refixed the line. lighting continued for several days and hundreds of lives were lost on both sides. At the endian attackAt the end an attack was organised by the troops and ’planes. ^he first plane, which was piloted by Ra’uf klshabib, started to drop bombs and was shot down. Soon afterwards a second plane started off, piloted by Squadron Leader Aramia Nasser (a Roman Catholic) and after he had dropped several bombs his plane caught fire and he landed in a parachute with his assistant soldier, Abdulla Hussein, and the wind dragged them on Ruraaitha. The troops attacked to save the pilot s life, but were too late and found the pilot dead with 43 wounds in his body. All Iraqians were sorry for him as he was beloved by everyone. A representative of the King and all members of parliament attended the funeral in Baghdad. After this trouble orders were given to stop fighting for three days to talk matters over. It is said that every thing is quiet now and the train is proceeding to Baghdad but the soldiers are still guarding the railway line. The cause of the trouble, which is the same as last year, is the Shi’as rights from the Government. I 8 * Kalba . It is understood that one of the clauses in the probable agreement with the Shaikh is that of a salute by visiting sloops.

It is understood that about 1200 tons await shipment on the island and that the quality is very good. As the Oxide is believed to sell at £15 a ton in England, and its cost of production is only £4 a ton, the Company should realise a good profit, particularly as their payment of royalties to the Sheikh of Sharjah Is only 2 Rupees (3s/-) a ton. ('Deptford” and Bahrain). KUWAIT. Relations with Iraft . Two incidents occurred during April which may well further embitter relations between the two states (a) On two occasions armed cars of the Iraqi Frontier Police penetrated 30 miles or more into Kuwait territory when on patrol. (b) A notice appeared in a Basrah newspaper that unless proof of ownership of some land near Fao was produced within 30 days, the land would be registered to the Iraq Government. The estate in question belongs to the Sheikh of Kuwait, and this is the most recent attempt of the many made in the last few years to confiscate it. Resident.

The new Vice-Consul, KhorraTishahr, called unofficially on our arrival and informed me that there had been some difficulties with the local Iranian authorities over the visit,owing to lack of instruction! from their Ministry at Tehran. The circumstances were fully reported by th^ Vice-Consul and Consul at Ahwaz to H.M. Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, and it is possible that local Governors will in future be more fully informed of the new Regulations for visits of H.M. Ships. 18« An Officer of the Guard from one of the Iranian ships at Khorramshahr visited me on arrival, in order to arrange a convenient time for the official call of the officer temporarilj in command of the Navy at Khorramshahr. Lieutenant Zand, the Commanding Officer of SIMORGH, accordingly visited me next day, but as I was engaged with official calls on the Governor and twc conferences with A.I.O.P. and A.I.O.C. officials, I explained that I would be unable to return his call in person. My 'Tavigating Officer was, therefore, sent to represent me. 19. From enouiries made locally, it appears that this interchange of calls with the Iranian Navy when H.M. Sloops visited Abadan commenced some y^ars ago, in spite of the distance between Khorramshahr and Abadan. During the last two years the practice had fallen into disuse, but it now seems that Bayendor intends to revive it. In view of his recent promotion and the doubt as to his relative rank and possible salute, it is not proposed to visit Abadan until these questions have been settled at Tehran. ^0* Gn 16th April I exchanged calls with the Governor of Abadan. He was most anxious to avoid any mention of the contretemps over the arrangements for SHORFHAM's visit, and confined his remarks to a discussion of the weather. Arrived at Muscat at 0850 on P7th April. A national salute was fired and I exchanged official calls with the Lilian s Representative, Saiyid Shahab, during the forenoon. He was accorded the usual salute on his leaving the ship. P8. The Political Agent and Saiyid Shahab had just returned by air from Sslalah where they had gone to discuss various questions with the Sultan. Among them was that of building at Khow Puwai and Hie Highness agreed to the work being taken in hand when desired and gave instructions that the Wall of Khassab should be informed to this effect. 79. Another question which may affect the Persian Gulf Division was that of the apprehension of the murderer of a British Indian subject. A report of the murder is contained in DKPTFORD s No.55 of 71st February forwarded as an enclosure to Report of Proceedings No.70/587 of 5th April, 1956. His highness wished that the alleged murderer’s identity should be more firmly established before any active stfcps are taken, for of the two/villages at Dibah the northern one, in which live the Shihuh tribe, owes allegiance to Muscat while the southern village is the headquarters of an independent tribe. It was arranged&lt;S5 arranged that theee inveatigatione should he undertaken by the Political Agent’s interpreter who was accordingly embarked in SHOREHAM for passage to Dibah, Various methods of causing the arrest of the murderer were discussed with the Political Agent who will in turn meet the Honourable the Political Resident at the end of the month. Difficulties are expected as it is thought the shaikh of the Shihuh may refwse to hand over the man to the Muscat authorities. X XX 9. Shinas was reached on £8th March and after the Political Agent’s business with the Wali had been completed, I moved on to Xhor Fakkan, and thence to Duhat Dibah the following day. 10. Calls were exchanged with the Shaikh of Dibah in the forenoon, ?9th March, and we explored at the back of the Town for a posslile site for an emergency landing ground for Imperial Airways. The journey between Sharjah and Jiunri (in British Baluchistan) is fraught with danger if head winds are experienced, as the petrol supply is scarcely adequate for this particularly long stretch. 11. The Shaikh of Beiah was sick (he was attended later by my Medical Officer), and unable to call personally, but he sent his son and we visited him in the afternoon to hand him a letter, from the Muscat Government, demanding the delivery to justice of the murderer of the Indian merchant (reported previously by DEPTFORD). IP. The Shihuh tribe, which inhabits the Runs al Jabal does not in practice admit allegiance to Muscat and it is probable that this demand will be disregarded. It was ascertained that the tribe has a fair number of fishing boats and, at a later date, the Mavy may be requested to capture some of these in order to bring the Shaikh to heel. As the natives are even poorer than anywhere I have yet visited in the Gulf, it is likely that such a measure would soon be efficacious. 15. Having been detailed to act as escort to a Flight of R.A.F. machines during their crossing of the Gulf of Oman on »lst March, I endeavoured throughout the day of the 50th March to ascertain their time of crossing. I eventually obtained a response and after contradictory messages, the time was finally given as 1030. I consequently left Dibah so as to reach the area by this time, only to find that they had crossed three hours earlier. No satisfactory explanation was given to me, nor was any apology forthcoming. 14. This is the second time within a few months that incorrect information from the Air Force authorities has rendered useless the trouble and expense of diverting FOWEY from her programme specially for escort work and, in this case, it caused no little inconvenience to the Political Agent, Muscat, in delaying his return by P4 hours to no purposei 15« On hearing that the machines were well over the Makran Coast I proceeded direct to Muscat. » X ft 7. Here (Abadan), for the first occasion in my experience, anlranian Officer of the Guard called to welcome me and to exchange exchange of calls• The following morning the Senior Officer (Lieutenant Ali Zand, Commanding SIMORGH) called on me and I returned his visit at Khorramchahr Naval Base.x z:t 8. I wae much impressed “by the 'ceremonial' disjiayed hy all ships alongside and hy the fact that, although in a closed car, er^ry sailor passed observed me and saluted. Quite a smart Guard was paraded at the base. 9. I understand that no further jetties, beyond the five at present completed, are contemplated. Water is or has been laid on to all jetties. ?'ork is now being concentrated on the 'boulevard' along the river front, providing access to the jetties and base. S 31 * * Bombay . 3. I should like to say how helpful were the dockyard in the manner in which our defects were completed, and also to express my gratitude for the expeditious way in which our supplementary list was dealt with. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. 24. It seeme that the competition between the shaiteh. of Sharjah and Debai to get the p^i ia territory has been very keen. The Shaikh of 1 ® understood to hare offered to more the r“8t house to Deb si free of charge, while the Shaikh of Sharjah countered by offering to dredge his lagoon, also for nothing. 26. I am informed that the Shaikh of Shihuh and a large number of his supporters come from the territory south of Khassab, and that they rely largely for fish on the facilities granted to them by the iali of Khassab. It is suggested that should oressure by the Sultan ever be required, Hie Hi^ness could do so through this medium. I also gather that the Weli is considerably respected in the area.Jg ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION SHOUlO Bir/^DDnEseiro to- TH* BRcrtTfRY or THE ADMIBAI.TY ionoon. e.w.i.

TRUCIAL COABT. 4 , Smallpox - With reference to February summary, a fresh outbreak occurred at Has A1 Khaimah early in March - 50 cases and 12 deaths ~ and as a result the proposed visit of a sloop to that place was cancelled.

Owing to the lateness of the rains this yoar, the grazing should be very good in Kuwait territory, and vTill in consequence attract many of the nomad tribes, so stimulating trade. At present the desert is reported to be carpeted with grass and flowers.15/ 8. Pilgrimage to Mecca . The number of pilgrims massing through Kuwait this year was 232, of whom 34 used car transport. A remarkable Journey was accomplished by one driver. Who completed the 1,200 miles from Kuwait to luecoa over the desert tracks in Just over 60 hours. This is record time so far. (Kuwait Int.Report). Visit of Bin Qaud . His Hajesty paid a rather unexpected visit to Kuwait at the beginning of February. He was accompanied by an extensive entourage comprising 675 followers in 140 cars. The ohaikh’s entertaining is reported to have been on a lavish scale, and Bin Baud was delighted with the warmth of his reception by the Kuwait crowds. 3-0• Although the visit has not led so far to any agreement alleviating the economic blockade of Kuwait, His Majesty emphasised in a public speech the cordial relations which exist between Saudi and Kuwait, and concluded by saying that he believed each State would come to tho other f s assistance in case of need. Present relations can hardly be described as 'cordial', but perhaps Ilia Majesty intends to adopt a more friendly attitude in future. 11. Bin Baud is also reported to have spent £13,000 in presents and to have acquired a further two wives. The Sheikh of Kuwait's financial disbursements were probably similar. 14. x x Iranian Navy .

Although Tehran papers received reported the presence for the first time of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides at the parade, the sailors apparently escaped notice. 17.

On the initiative of the Minister of Finance, a largo factory equipped with modem machinery to the value of £65,000 is to be erected on the outskirts of Tehran. It will contain 45 to 50 machines for cutting, cigarette making and packing, and when in operation will produce about 12 million cigarettes a day.

Some considerable prominence has been given in the Tehran Press to the trial of the ex-IAinlster for Communications, who was arrested and dismissed from his nost for accepting bribes from a Dutch company.

A proposal to start a steamship company working from Bushire has been made recently, and merchants of that Town have been induced to subscribe the equivalent of about £32,000.

It is reported in the Iranian press that a branch railway line is to be built from Shiraz to Isfahan and thence to join the Trans-Iranian Railway, presumably at Kum. (14 Me s sager) With reference to previous summaries, it is now reported that efforts are being made to start a civil air service on the following routes in June 1936 :- Tehran - Isfahan - Shiraz - Bushire. Tehran - Bagdad. As yet the Iranian Oovernment have not asked for permission to fly over Iraq. 26. Two more pilots, destined for the D.H.

The Company suggested 15th Aug. as a more likely date of completion, but the Head Office replied by telegram that work must be finished by the former date. 29. European personnel on 1st January comprised 49 United Btatos subjects and 26 British, but others have arrived since this date. 30. The Company^ topping plant has boon unable to provide petrol for all the motor transport in use, and at the end of Larch a consignment of 10,000 four gallon tins had to be obtained from Abadan. 31 . s.J. 'California Standard !r left on 11th March with 16,000 tons of crude oil - the destination was said to be Suez.

Report, three temporary buoys in Khor Khadama have now been moored by the Basrah Port Directorate. Machinery was landed from two otrlck Line steamers early in March, and it Is understood that a pier has boon built at Has Khadama to facilitate disembarkation. 33 . The site of the Fields camp at Bahra was visited by a director of the Kuwait and Anglo-Iranian Oil Companies in March, and he also toured the rest of concession aroa to the southward of Kuwait. The dheikh appeared to be anxious to please and placed a spare palace at the director^ disposal. (Kuwait I.R. and 'Deptford'). 34 . Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Major Holmes representing this Company (he is also Sheikh^ representative in/i'? in the Kuwait Oil Go.) arrived at Kuwait in mid February. He ia said to have instructions concerning several areas 'roundabout' Arabia, but with so many concessions having been granted all along the Arabian Coast, it is possible that he may turn his attention to Gulf Islands.

On the forenoon of the 1st March, accompanied by the Oommanding Officer, H.M.S. DEPTFORD, I called on the Political Agent and subsequently on His Excellency The Shaikh of Koweit. Both these calls were returned later, and the customary salutes fired. Both Commanding Officers were invited to luncheon at the Agency at which the Shaikh was present and in the evening we dined with him at his Palace. 5. The following morning, the British residents were entertained onboard FOWEY; the Shaikh, Political Agent and several others stayed to luncheon with me and the remainder lunched onboard DEPTFORD. 6. We reached Bushire at 0900 on 4th March and fired the national salute. Which was returned by the shore battery. Exchange of calls with the Honourable the Political Resident was cancelled at his request, but he accompanied the Commanding Officer H.M.S. DEPTFORD and myself on our call on the Governor of Bushire. His Excellency returned our call later at the Residency. M. Ardelon has only recently taken over the Governorship, having previously been Minister for Roads in the Iranian Cabinet. He talks French fluently and seemed most friendly. 7. Several of us stayed at the Residency and we received the greatest kindness from everybody. ********* 8.

From conversations with the residents and with the B.I. this excuse was genuine The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Captains4 Cartalns, 1 feel that Bushire is too harshly spoken of In the Persian Gulf Guide hook. The mall steamers lie comfortably at the inner anchorage In all weathers, and strong winds are not more prevalent here than at other places In the Gulf. In summer, it Is much drier than Bahrain and other southern rorts. Personally, It struck me as by far the most attractive place In the Gulf. There is a greater variety of trees and flowers and some semblance of country, non-existent elsewhere. 12. 1 arrived at Loha »t 1000 on 9th March. 'The Shaikh of Qatar himself came off to call. This Is the first occasion I have visited Doha that he has been able to do so &lt;nd he admitted his health was better than in the summer. The Navigating Officer and I accompanied the Resident on his return call and we remained to midday meal, sailing for Abu Dhabi at 1500. 15. I reached abu Dhabi at 1100 on 10th March and calls were exchanged with the Shaikh. The Resident had a certain amount of business to transact and the Shaikh, though outwardly friendly, was as equivocal and vacillating as ever. 15. The visit to Ras al Khaimah had to be cancelled owing since taking over, but I did not feel justified. In the v circumstances. In taking the ship there, and Solonel Fowle was agreeable to the visit being cancelled. 16.

Sharjah on 12th March, so the Resident did not return the calls of the Shaikhs of uram al Qaiwain and Ajman. The latter brought off two calves as a gift to the Resident who presented them to the ship. *** The Resident had brought presents for all the Shaikhs, but none of them evinced the slightest gratitude. 17. Ajman struck the Resident - as he has always struck me ■ as having the greatest personality of any of the Trucial Shaikhs: though, not having the same power, he has not the \ | ambition of Has al Khaimah. ~18. The Shaikh of Sharjah called during the afternoon of 12th March. *******»»* 19. At 0100 on 13th March, a small balam arrived alongside^ This had been paddled 7 miles, in quite a choppy sea, by an escaped slave who, seeing the ship, had made a second and desperate attempt at liberty. (He had been recaptured on his previous effort some months back). It was a plucky essay, as his ankles were manacled together and, had the balam capsized, he must have been drowned. His manacles were sawn off and the Resident took his statement. He is now onboard FOWEY and will be taken to Bahrain where his case will be heard. The balam has been returned to its owner. 20. We returned the call of the Shaikh of Sharjah and Debai on 13th March, the latter being in camp some miles out in the desert, and had to face the ordeal of two large Arab meals within 2 hours of each other. The Resident left the ship that forenoon, as the weather look unpromising and he preferred the certainty of being at the Rest House when the plane - Which is taking him to Delhi - arrived. * * * * * * * * ** * * ** * * * *** * *** ♦ ** * * &amp; Sd...Neville Harvey.

FOWEY. The movements of H.M.Ship under my command are hereby communicated as a result of the following signal from the Hon. the Political Resident:- 'Residency .agent has reported to Political Agent, Bahrain, the murder of an Indian, name unknown, near Ras-al-Khaimah, by one Abdullah bin Salem bin Malkash, a member of the Shihuh tribe belonging to Muscat territory. Residency agent has gone to Ras-al-Khaimah. Could H.M.S. DEPTFORD arrange to nick him up on her tour of the North Batineh coast with the object of making enquiries at Baiah where the Shaikh of Shihuh is now residing and if possible ascertain - name and other details of murdered man, whether he is a British Indian subject, whereabouts of the murderer.' 1. I left Ghubbat Ghazirah at 0600 on the 15th and arrived at Ras-al-Khaimah at 1545 to find conditions quite unsuitable for communication with shore, or anchoring. I/therefore proceeded to sea for the night, returning the next morning to find similar conditions prevailing. After telling the Residency Agent to wait at Ras-al-Khaimah until my arrival on moderation of weather, I went to Khassab for shelter. 2. On return to Ras-al-Khaimah the next day, 17th, I found conditions suitable, embarked Hussein, and sailed for Dibbah. after oiling at Khassab to render medical aid to BRITISH AMBASSADOR, I arrived at Dibbah at 0800 on 18th. 3. The Shaikh of Dibbah was very prompt in calling on me, and I returned his visit later in the forenoon. As the murdered man had stayed with him, it was possible to obtain from him as much of the required information as was available. 4. However, in order to make the investigation as full as possible, Hussein subsequently visited the Shaikh of Shihuh who could not come off to the ship owing to severe headache due to eye trouble. He was not prepared to give any information, but merely stated that he had heard that an Indian had been murdered, and would not admit that Bin Malkash was the murderer. 5. It struck me that a high degree of mutual fear and mistrust exists between these closely adjoining villages the inhabitants of which, from their Shaikhs downwardsdownwards, do not seem to see eye to eye. The Shaikh of Dibbah did not want to part with any information unless he was promised Government support* because he was afraid of the Shaikh of Shihuh. The Shaikh of Shihuh was not giving anything away because he was afraid of his more vindictive tribesmen, and consequently seemed inclined to shield the suspected murderer, who is well known and influential in the Shihuh. 6. The facts so far gained are as follows-:- An Indian travelling from Karachi to Debai via Muscat!. Dibbah, and Ras-al-Khaimah, stayed two nights with the Shaikh of Dibbah. He asked for transport and a pilot to take him to Ras-al-Khaimah but could not get them in Dibbah, so he went to Baiah and started with Bin Malkast/as - a guide. His body was found 7 miles from Ras-al-Khaimah, stripped of everything except a coat and umbrella. There was no sign of Bin Malkash who returned to the Baiah area where presumably he stayed, for he was seen on the beach early on the morning we arrived there. f There was no evidence of any witnesses to the murder so I supnose that, if faced with a trial, he could say that it was committed by other men and he was frightened and ran away. Against this, however, is the assertion that Bedouins will not attack a man who is being escorted by a Bedouin. 7. Having obtained all the information he could, Hussein returned on board and I landed him at Ras-al- Khalmah early in the morning of the 19th. 8. I feel that the presence of the ship was of moral assistance to Hussein in his conversations and that the inhabitants will feel that the Government are taking steps to deal with this, the second murder in the course of a few months. 9. A full report of Hussein’s Investigations has been rendered by him to the Political Agent, Bahrain. od...G.P.B. Bowlby. Gonmander.10 .

At present Khor Fakkan comes under the rule of the Shaikh of Kalba and he has nut in a headman and eight soldiers.

I was informed by the Consul that His Excellency’s illness was due to the strain of observing Ramadan. X X X X X X 17.- Shooting parties went up to the marshes on several days, the total bag being about 400 duck and 150 black partridges. We were most grateful to the Consul for the loan of hie launch on more than one occasion. 19.- The fast of Ramadan finished on the evening of 26th December and the Idd festivities commenced next day. Messages of congratulation were sent to the BUtasarrif. the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwaiti and the representative of H.H. the Bultan of Kiiscat. I had intended to offer my congratulations to the former in person, but was unable to do so as it had been arranged for 'SHORSHAM - to proceed to Margil. There was some doubt as to when the new moon would be observed, as the weather had been very cloudy at the commencement of Ramadan, and I understand that the welcome news was eventually telegraphed from Palestine. X X X X X X 22.- AB ADAH. '3H0RSHAM* left Margil at noon 30th December. Wnen passing Moharamerah the customary guard was paraded but it was observed that all was not well with the Persian detachment and one man was particularly late in falling in. As soon as •SHOREHAM' sounded the 'carry on', the Persian sergeant turned in fury on the late-comer, knocked him down, and kicked him repeatedly and with apparent relish in the middle.

On 3rd November, Flight Lieutenant Macdonald with three of 84 Squadron (Vincents) arrived from Muscat, and at luncj* time Flight Lieutenant Nuttall also arrived from Shaibah with two aircraft and Mr. Cross, who is the Airways Manager of the Near iCast Area. The object of Mr. Cross* visit was to find a suitable landing place on the Trucial Coast for the 1937 progranije Airways flying boats. After luncfe Colonel Loch, Mr. Cross, my navigator - Lieutenant Tod - and myself, were flown over Ras-Al-Khaimah, Uhm-Al-^awain and uebai to have a look at the lagoons at these places. We then returned to Sharjah and the whole party came off to the 'Lupin' to discuss future plans. 5. Next day. at the request of Colonel Loch, I moved up to ton-Al-Qawaln and the Shaikh came off to call as soon as we had anchored, the call being returned by Colonel Loch and Mr. Cross before sunset; the unual salutes were fired. 6. The Shaikh was quite agreeable to a survey of his lagoon being made and this was done by Lieutenant Tod, who was accompanied by Mir. Cross, next day. X X X X X 7. - I moved up from Unn^Al-oawain to Ras-Al-Khaimah early on 6th November and anchored off the entrance to the lagoon.

He brought back the Shaikh*s v cousin to call, the Shaikh himself being still away at Bahrain. X X X X X X 8. - .*hen the Shaikh*s cousin was asked about the surveying of the lagoon, he was at first very suspicious andaai pointed out that the R.A.F. flying boats had used th lagoon for the past few years. In time, however, he gained the impression that there was a possibility of money forthcoming in the future and so gave his consent.

With him were Bayed Mahmood, Bayed Hamed and Bayed Nadir. My call was returned by all the above. They were interested in the ship and the differences in design, guns, etc., as opposed to the '3JDRSHAM' class. They seemed disappointed that we had only got power for a meagre 17 knots. The usual salute was fired. X X X X XMiacatu 22. The Sultan 1 b away at Dhofar. Recently his visits there have been of considerable duration, three to four months, and it is thought that he wishes to make Dhofar the capital. There is, however* the disadvantage that the proximity to the Kali desert makes it a dangerous locality due to the probability of raids by fierce Bedouin tribes. This is considered to be a sufficient deterrent to the project at the moment. 23. Sayod Hamed, ‘the wicked uncle' and Wall of Mattrah. is at present officially on leave granted by the Dultan. He took his leave, bit refuses to leave the State House because he is afraid that he will never be allowed to return there. Consequently Sayed Mahmood, who has been appointed to temporary duty as ..all during Bayed ffaiped's leave, has to travel daily to and from Muscat. 24. During my call, the A byssinian situation was discussed, and all present appeared to be in favour of the doctrine of collective security. Bayed Nadir, who had more to say for himself than the others, voiced the opinion that the fighting would soon stop in Abyssinia and that island will benefit as a result. 'It is', he said, 'an old Arab saying that, 'when two countries fight, a third reaps the harvest', and Bhgland is that third mrty'.

There is considerable trade depression due to three cj^uses (1) The poor price paid for fish in Colombo where most of their catch is sent. (2) The high taxes (10%) on imported Japanese goods.

A similar suggestion for the restriction of the pearling season was made to the Political Agent, Kuwait last year.

An accusation was also made that we were conniving at the importation of arms into Palestine to arm the Jews against the Arabs. (Bahrain Int. Report )• 39. In Kuwait, it is considered that the Abyssinian chance of success has been greatly improved now that they are permitted to buy arms, and with sanctions being applied against Italy. The Arabs liken Abyssinia to a poor woman who, while struggling to keep her virtue, falls under the gaze of a licentious man determined to possess her, believing that no one will consider it worth while to protect her. There is also the feeling that the Muslim States of Arabia may be the next to attract the ’’Colonising 3tates M of ISuro (Kuwait Int. Report r 40.

Colonel Loch had not previously been to RAS-AL-KHAIMAH, nor had he met the Shakh, and it was for this reason that this visit had been arranged. 4.

I told the Shaikh that the Senior Naval Officer was unavoidably detained at Bahrain and at the same time gave him the Senior Naval Officer’s congratulatory message. The Shaikh did not appear to register mudi pleasure when he heard ofthis honour and outside observers thought the interview had fallen a little flat* certainly the dignity of the proceedings was interrupted by the Shaikh’s four year old son, who found that two glasses of sherbet were straining his capacity.

The Shaikh’s brother came off to call and Colonel Loch returned the call later on, but he could not induce him to send any representative of ABU DHABI in the ship without the Shaikh's approval; so next morning we sailed for DOHA, anchoring to the south-west of HALUL for the night* DOHA. 10th - 11th October . 16.

The D/F stations at Bahrain and Sharjah had also been co-opted £o aesist the VALENCIA in fixing her position. 1? . In the evening Colonel Loch visited the Shaikh and later , accompanied by three of the ship’s officers, had dinner with him. During the visit Colonel Loch asked the Shaikh for a guide for next day’s flight and two Bedouins were summoned by the Shaikh; when these two men heard what was asked of them they retired to consider the problem and then fled from (JATAR. Whether this was due to the fear of flying in an aeroplane or to the possibility of being mixed up in boundary questions relating to Saudi Arabia is unknown.

Before turning over the care of the State to his representative for the next four months. His Highness investigated the recent conduct of some of his wicked uncles. As a result, one uncle who has been grossly neglectful of his duties as Wali of Matrah, was relieved from his post on the grounds of ill-health. It seems probable that the complaints by other members of the Ruling family against the immorality of the Sultan’s representative were considered as frivolous by His Highness, for this appointment has not been changed. Gwadur. The trade depression in this small dependency of Muscat is reported to be particularly bad this year. Mekranis who fomerly bought their goods at Gwadur now go to Pasni in order to avoid the new duty levied by the Kalat State on articles imported via Gwadur. Another reason for the depression is the poor price paid in Colombo this year for dried fish. Gwadur ? s main export. TKUCIAL COAST.

The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah was shown over the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s fields during his stay, and doubtless hoped that he would soon see such derricks in his own shaikhdom.

COMMUNICATIONS IN THE CftJIff. Cables and Wireless Limited. The Company’s cable ship visited flahrain at the end of October, and the Master reported that the following re-organisation of Gulf Cables is now in progress • The cable from Karachi to Jask has been lifted at a point about 45 miles west of Charbar (Has Tank), and to it a new cable has been Joined which connects with Muscat. The old Charbar-Jask cable and the cable from Has Tank to Jask have been removed. There are already cables from Jask to Muscat, and Jask to Bushire* These will remain for a year or so until the Persians build a W/T station at Jask, after which the cable station will be given up and the two cables joined together at sea* Communication by cable will then be Karachi - muscat, Muscat - Bushire* The old cable between Jask and Henjam has already been removed, and the portion of the Henjam-Bushire cable between Hen jam and Has Mutaf will be taken up in the near future* Bahrain is to be connected to Bushire by laying a new cable from the former place to a point south of Has Mutaf where it will connect to the remainder of the old Buahire-Henjam cable* The cable landing at Bahrain will be close to the R.A.F. pier at first, and on completion of the fdahamah-Muharraq causeway, the cable will be transferred to it and enter the sea from Muharraq Island. The scheme when complete will therefore bet- Karachl-Musoat, Muscat-Bushire, Bushlro-Fao, with a branch cable from Bushire to Bahrain. OIL INTERESTS. Bahrain.

As reported above, three of the Truoial Shaikhs who vlilUod^TSahrain recently, appear to be taking considerable Interest in oil and its production. Ras-el-Khaimah sold the Anglo-Iranian oil Company the exploration rights in his shaikhdom a few months ago, and now similar rights have been acquired by the Company at Sharjah and Debai. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi is still believed to be holding out against the blandishments of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and possibly his territory is the most likely to be oil bearing. His preference for dealing with Major Holmes of the Kuwait Oil Company is known, but the latter is believed to have found only one/1+2 if n on© financial backer and may therefor© have to give up his project of forming a 100# British Company. Meanwhile, it is understood that Mr. Ricketts of Ethiopian fame was recently in Baghdad, but it is doubtful whether a ^oup 1 on the Truoial Coast would be sufficiently spectacular after his recent financial adventures. Kuwait. Constructions and drilling materials are exnected to arrive in November and will probably be landed between Has Kadhama and a point about 3 miles to the northeast. (See Chart Ho.1214). The Company have decided to drill at three points; Bahra on the North side of the bay, Burgan about 30 miles south of Kuwait town, and at a third point between Burgan and Kuwait. Oil ooze is in evidence at the first two places, and gas at the third. Hasa. It is reported that a high gas pressure has been found in die first well drilled, but little oil. Permission is being sought to sink a second well. (Bahrain Int. Report). XXX X ARMS AND SLAVE TRAFFIC. 'LUPIN' carried out a 24-hour patrol in the Straits of Hormuz at the end of October during which three dhows were sighted and searched. It Is probable that these occasional patrols are sufficient to limit the traffic to its present small proportions, and the news of such searches undoubtedly spreads along the Arab Coast. ITALQ ABYSSINIAN CRISIS. The war is the chief topic of conversation among the Arabs and there seems little doubt that the British attitude in the dispute has greatly enhanced our prestige. It is widely believed that Great Britain is the League of Nations, and also that as ’’protecting power' to Abyssinia we must eventually assist her against the Italians. Letters from Arabs at Aden and in Egypt containing news of naval and air concentrations, do much to confirm this belief. (Bahrain and Kuwait Int.

Ac flying boats were not available to supervise the stowage of petrol and oil in the store, the key was sent down with a flight from No.84 Squadron (commanded by Flight lieutenant Nuttall) and dropped on the sea near SHORFJtAM who arranged for tanks to be replenished. At Air Headquarter’s request, a small stock of petrol and oil was also sent to Has—Al—Hadd by dhow, my Interpreter, hon Bahib Mohammed Bin alem, ably arranging the shore transport for the trifling charge of Rupees Three. ^ le Shaikh of Rae-al-Hadd was most friendly, and messenger at Khor Jarama in case I should reouire anyt ing from him.

Years ago tills reminder was given to all dhows en ering the lagoon that the fhaikh required his harbour dues. 19. MUSCAT . Leaving Khor Jarama at 0845 on 27th September, SHOREHAM arrived at Muscat nine hours later. The Political Agent, Major Watts, and Flight Lieutenant Nuttall, dined with me in SHOREHAM that evening. As the former had only just returned from recess and had had no previous opportunity of calling officially on any ship since he assumed duty at Muscat, an exchange of calls was arranged for the following forenoon and his first salute as Political Agent was given him. SHOREHAM then sailed for Khor Kuwai. MUSCAT to :im : 1WAI - 28th - 29th September. 20. On passage, I decided to proceed clone inshore between Maen’ah and A1 Khadhra but no dhows were seen.

We left Sir Bu Na Air at 0330 and looked for a pearling fleet to visit* A small fleet was discovered close to the West side of Zirko and m anchored close to them* The fleet comprised dhows from Bahrain and Sharjah. They did not appear to be doing too well and the dhow that was visited had only a few oysters. Some of these were opened and one tiny 'seed” pearl was all that could be found. A pearl merchant was visiting the fleet and had a few pearls for sale, but not at an attractive price. Several Arabs came on board for medical treatment. After a two hours stay (which was of great interest as it gave us a good insight into pearling procedure) we left for Halul, and arrived there at 1700. x x x x x ABADAN. WEDNESDAY, 28th AUGUST. I called on the Governor and he returned my visit shortly afterwards. As usual, he was in very good form. He appeared to be concerned over the threatened war in Abyssinia, looking upon Italy as an unwarranted aggressor. But his chief concern was the Iraq - Iran discussions regarding the Boundary Question, and he considered that the Gulf lights etc. should not be taken over by Iran un?.ess they obtain Revenue for their upkeep from dues etc* extracted from the Shatt el Arab. X XXX X BAHRAIN. 12th - 16th AUGUST. During the next three days, working parties from BIDEFORD and FOWEY were landed to lay the Decaville Track, - the whole section along the pier was completed before BIDEFORD sailed on 15th August; work on the remainder progresses and will be continued by LUPIN - the six trucks were converted and diving for the anchor of No*l Buoy carried out. The latter proved a most difficult operation, as a fairly stiff wind was blowing throughout the week, with Spring Tides. The position in which the anchor should have been was buoyed and the surrounding area searched without success. No work would have been possible without the use of a large and powerful boat and I am most grateful to the Political Agent for his kindness in placing the Agency Motor Dhow at our disposal, x x xx x The Honourable The Political Resident, Mr. A.Allison - an A.I. 0. C. geologist - and Mr. Haji Williamson - an A. I. 0. C. liaison officer - arrived at Bahrain; the Commanding Officer called unofficially on the former at the Agency. RAS-AL-KHAIMAH, TUNS and KHOR KUWAI . On 23rd July LUPIN, with Mr. Allison and Mr.Williamson on board, sailed from Bahrain and anchored off Ras-al-Khaimah the following evening. The ship's motor-boat and skiff brought the Shaikh off to call and he was saluted with 3 guns on leaving just.. •I just before sunset. The next day the Commanding Officer returned the call, leaving Mr. Allison and Mr. Williamson ashore as guests of the Shaikh. x xxx Before returning to Ras-al-Khaimah to re-embark the A.I.0.C. party, LUPIN spent one evening at Bu Musa and then went to Sharjah to meet the east and west bound planes as the former was bringing down the ship 's air mail from Bahrain. The Shaikh called in the forenoon; he seemed a littled disappointed that the A.I.0.C. geologists were not visiting Sharjah as he had been led to expect, but it was explained that time and the hot weather prevented their remaining for any length of time on the Trucial Coast just now. x xxx BUSHIRE. 6th - 11th AUGUST. After a stay of only two days at Bahrain LUPIN visited Bushire, anchoring on arrival at the inner anchorage. The Commanding Officer called first on the acting the Honourable The Political Resident - Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E. - and then on the acting Governor; the latter returned the call at the Residency. Next morning the ship shifted berth, anchoring off Bushire. The weather was fine but terribly hot. the sea temperature being 96°F.; I was fortunate In being asked to stay at the Residency. The Wardroom officers very much appreciated the kindness of the Honourable The Political Resident and Mrs. Loch in asking them daily to lunch, tennis and dinner, as conditions on board with a south east wind were trying. XX xx KOWEIT. 12th AUGUST. The Gommanding Officer called on the Political Agent and the Shaikh of Koweit: both of these calls were returned next day and salutes of 11 and 7 guns were fired respectively. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed al-Jahir al-Sabah is soon expected back from his visit to England. Shaikh Abdullah al-Salim al-Sabah is at present holding the position of Shaikh of Eoweit. Shaikh Abdullah very kindly invited the Commanding Officer and two officers to have an Arab dinner with him in front of his house situated in the bay east of the town. X X X X The Shaikh of Koweit in referring to the Italian - Abyssinian troubles mentioned that any Italian success would not be likely to react in our (British) favour, as the Arabs as a whole were sided strongly in favour of the Abyssinians against the Europeans. x xINDEXED ANY FUnTHSn COMMUNICATION SHOULD Be ADDRESSED TO- TH!C n^CPETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY LONDON.

The most recent, occurred at Barkah, where four armed Bedouin attacked a house, and robbed its Inmates. Two Arabs were wounded while endeavouring to protect their property. 2. H.h. The Sultan visited ^ohar in mid-August, and the ^ali there reported the neighbourhood to be quiet. 3. Interior Oman. The Sultan's representative Informed the Senior Naval Officer that a dispute had arisen between several of the tribes of the interior, but that he expected a settlement shortly. 4. The H Wicked'’ Uncles. There are s to lies at Muscat of the dis-satisfaction of various of the Sultan's uncles with the present regime. ~&gt;uch talk recurs periodically, and the uncles' chief complaints ares- (a) The Sultan's frequent absence. (b) His refusal to restore their ^pay-cuts' now that there is a surplus in the treasury. (c) His arrogance and disregard of their views. At the end of September, an added complaint was that the Sultan's representative was most irreroral, but this, though perhaps true, applies equally to all the Muscat nobility. Humour has it that the trouble in the interior (para.3 above) has been stirred up by one of the discontented uncles. X XX X KUWAIT. 7. H»B. the Shaikh's Return . The Shaikh returned to Kuwait on 14th September. On his way out from England he V visitecV'visited Jerusalem, Damascus, ^aifa, Amman, Cairo and Alexandria, and also stayed for a few days in Baghdad. At all places he was delighted with the attention shown him. 8. The Political Agent reports that there were fully 25,000 Arabs on the aerodrome to meet Sir Ahmed and that there were the most amazing and touching scenes of enthusiasm and loyalty on his safe return. 9. halations with Iraq . Lately, there has been a certain amount of propaganda in the Iraq press directed against the independence of Kuwait. To quote examples, one Baghdad paper published an article under the heading M Should Kuwait be united with Iraq” while another article was entitled 'The annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, the nucleus of the aspired for Arab Union”• A Jerusalem paper also published an article reported as emanating from Baghdad called ’’The people of Kuwait aspire to be united with Iraq, but the British Government attempts to extend her protection over that country'. 10. While in Baghdad, the Shaikh visited the Minister of the Interior, and after a long discussion regarding his date gardens, appealed to the Minister for more consideration and honourable treatment than he had received hitherto. The Minister promised to do all he could. 11. The above now being known in Kuwait, the Shaikh’s subjects feel that by his appeal to H.k. Government, the Shaikh has preserved the independence of his State by staving off the alleged IraqA claims for political control. (Kuwait Int. Keport.) 12. Halations with Saudi Arabia . ®ewa from Kiath credits Bin Saud with openly vowing vengeance on Kuwait owing to what he calls 'the insulting Notes which he has received from H.to. Government' over the violation of Kuwait's/Kuwait’s frontier. (See para.62 of *nt. Keport) The blockade has been rigidly enforced of late, and during mirust the Kuwaitis felt nervous as to Bin Saud’s next r.ove. The return of the i^uler has, however, inspired confidence as his subjects feel that the blockade question has now been properly ventilated in fondon. PERSIAN NAVY. 25. Movements.

A rendezvous is fixed by the intending smugglers with the duty Persian gunboat and the former then pay 25/? of the cargo, either in cash or kind, to the Commandin Officer.

Many successful smuggling ventures on the Tangistan coast, are reported from Bushire, and the goods can even be bought very cheaply in that town. Three hundred extra road guards were recruited at Bushire during August, in an attempt to check these operations. (Bushire Int. Report.) Internal . 30. Suppression of traditional Customs . The Shah^ endeavours to Aesternise his people have resulted in several most unpopular orders recently. On the anniversary of the death of ttie daughter of the Prophet, beating of breasts was not allowed, while in future prayers and mourning for the dead, instead of taking 36 hours as formerly, have been limited to 2 hours. Ifoveover mourners may not squat, but must sit on sofas. An order that women should no longer wear the veil in public roused such opposition that it was enforced only in the case of young girls. There is also a report that in future Sunday is to be observed as a day of prayer instead of Friday. 31./31.

Is expected to visit Baghdad in the near future. (Kuwait Int. Report) 35. At the end of September, the A.I.O.C. were trying hard to get the concession at Abu Lhabl but were experiencing difficulties, for as aborted in the July summary, the Shaikh would much prefer to deal with lajor Holmes.IRAQ * 36* Llatuifoance near Kuma * In continuation of last report, air action by the Iraqi Air Force had to bo ta^en near Godina on account of the triboarcen’s opposition to conscription. ^ho Iraq army wore also engaged.

The ouildings and offices were well laid out in pleasant surroundings. Heoruits were undergoing field training and there was considerable activity on the foreshore where piles are being driven. Lieutenant Ohahin f who was deputising for Lieut''dolonol ilayendor, said that one of the two barges cowed out from Italy by bdY.iOVS was to be used for oil in the Gulf, lyavai iase .

FQy^Y^ Reception at Abadan * When Senior Kaval Officer was at Tehran, h.jn, Minister informed him that Persian officers or officials were not allowed to visit the Legation. It is possible that Beyendor may have had this in mind when he refused to allow his officers to attend the reception in FOWxilY at Abadan on A.**. the Kin^s Birthday, as there would have been insufficient time to obtain permission from Tehran. JL X X X SAUDI ARABIA. 15. Blockade Commission , it appears that before leaving Kuwait, most of the delegates and their servants bought several thousand rupees worth of contraband which they hoped to smuggle into Riath. Bin Baud’s blockade officer, however, insisted on searching their baggage at the frontier and instead of confiscating the contraband, sent a list of it to Bin Baud. The King’s anger was reported as ’wondrous to behold* (Kuwait Int. Report) Id. Reoelllon in Kejran . With reference to July Sumriary, further confirmation is reported of a rebellion in hejran. Apparently Bin Baud’s original garrison of 70 has been wiped out and a relief party disarmed and sent back. The trouble is said to be due to ill-treatment of the tribes. Bin Baud is reported to be contemplating revenge on the Kejranis when the cooler weather sets in. (Kuwait Int. Report). 17. Return of exiled Bhaikhs . efforts are still being made to induce various exiled Shaikhs living in Iraq to return to flejd. Although most desire to accept the King’s offer of pardon, they are afraid of treachery, and there are stories of torture and death which seem likely to deter them from returning to their real homes. It is said that Bin Baud is a changed man since the attempt/c5&lt;B&gt; attempt on his lifa # and lookc like following his grandfather^ example of becoming 'a cruel, savage and despotic tyrant.

Staff Officer (Intelligence), Colombo reports that the Bahrain Oil Company are considering the construction of a refinery either at Bahrain or at Colombo. l*he company expect to serve r,gypt, ^ast and South Africa, India and Saigon. 20. Movements of Oilers , It is evident that the selling organisation have been successful in finding markets recently, for the following oilers loaded at Bahrain during the month ^.V, diiKTii toAiiRSK (Danish ) 8283 tons for Antwerp Jfi.V. VIGRID (Norwegian) 10483 tons for Japan. S.S.

RiLijJA will proceed to San Francisco after discharging her present cargo and her place on the Japanese run willbe taken by a foreign chartered oiler. 21. Movements of Oil Company^ Officials , Mr Skinner returns to Bahrain to take over management at t the end of September and Mr Davies will then proceed to Damman to take charge of the Standard Oil foorks on the mainland, ** a8a * Is reported to have been struck at Damman.

The Shaikh proceeded to Baghdad early in August where he consulted two doctors. It was feared that he had tuberculosis but his complaint has now been diagnosed as overeating and he left for his shaikhdom at the end of the month. It is possible that the visit may also have been for business reasons, but as Major holmes has not returned from England, this is doubtful, he was also said to be short of cash, Qatar . With reference to paragraph 65 of last sumiGary, it is expected that the work of marking the landing ground and erecting the petrol store will be completed early in Septemoer, It is reported that the Shaikh has received a letter from Bln Saud telling him to stop work on this landing ground until the boundary question between Qatar and Sauai-Arabia has been settled. Matter has been dealt with by the honourable the Political Resident and worK is proceeding. Presumeoly the Ai ir Saud was co&gt;.earned with this question during his recent visit to England. * * x x •i * IRAQ . S1, gropoaad Iraq ftavy . i r continuation of last summary, Colonal Bard stated at Tehran, that he thought a few river gunboats (preferably second-hand) and a sloop of/of the latest class, would fulfil Iraqi requirements# It was understood that the latter would also he used as a Royal Yacht. 32, Disturbance near Kurna . At the end of August police and troops from dasran proceeded to the neighbourhood of Kurna. At first, it was rumoured that the reoellion had broken out anew, but it is understood that the armed forces were used to round up and capture a band of outlaws, There is a certain amount of unrest among the Arab tribes as a result of the new conscription law, out there has been no open rebellion. ITALY AND A3YSSIMA . 33. Keen interest in the dispute is being taken on both sides of the Gulf, doth Persian and Arab sympathy is with Abyssinia, and the part played by England is reported to have run up our 'stock' in an astonishing manner. The Arabs .regard Italy as a bully, and the way in which the Italians destroyed thousands of Arab homes round Tripoli in her horth African campaign, still further prejudices opinion against her. Should war break out and the Italians win, it is thought that we will lose prestige through failing to avert the catastrophe. On the other hand, in the event of an Abyssinian victory, the war will most likely be cc*isidered as black versus white, and our prestige as a European race will probably suffer far greater in consequence. x x XCONFIDENTIAL ITHER COMMUNICATION SHOULD lODRESSEO TO- tK bccretary nr the admiralty LONDON.

The Shaikh oame on board soon after arrival # and it seems that the ministrations of the many and varied doctors he has consulted recently, have resulted in a slight improvement in his condition. He had little to say other than that pearling was bad, but when I offered to bring my medical officer ashore, he became most enthusiastic and discoured at some length on the treatment of his several ailments. He was saluted on leaving the ship. I returned his call immediately, and much of the time was occupied in his medical examination, whilst I enjoyed the comparative coolness of his mejlis. XX X XX XHASSAB AND XHOR XUWAI. SHOREHAM arrived at lhassab at 1845 on £3rd July and on the following forenoon I exchanged calls with the Wall. The district appeared to be quiet and the Wali rather bored at having been appointed to such an out-of-the-way place. His chief concern was to rig his new boat with English out sails and he was therefore most gratefhl when I arranged for him to copy those of SHOREHAlv^s skiff. I questioned him with regard to the number of labourers available at Khassab and the best place to obtain building stone, as such points require investigation before arrangements for buildings at Khor icuwai can be made. 3H0REHAM left Khor Xuwai at 0530 on 27th July and after collecting samples of stone from Elphinstone Inlet and Hassa, arrived at Tunb Island during the afternoon. The lightkeeper had nothing tosreport. A sample of stone was also taken from this island, as I understand Tunb stone is frequently used for building on the Truoial Coast. X X X X X ( contd)X X X X tlT.XIAL COASff &gt; ffOTKS OH 3HAIiCHl&gt;a^ « In continuation of Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf's No*30/£17 of 20th July 1935, relatire to Abu Dhabi, the following notes on other Crucial Shaikhdoiaa visited are forwarder 2. UfaiBAI, (a) oil, f ihe Shaikh had received information from the Hontnirable the Political Hesident that a geologist would be sent to examine his territory after the hot weather, and was quite content. (h) %x-&gt;Shaikh Hasaan . After explaining how he had largely been responsible for arranging the submission of this trouble maker at ilhasaab, the Shaikh of Debai suggest ed that perhaps Hassan had now expiated his offence as he had served about seven years in prison at Muscat. Apparently this was also the general feeling on the Crucial Coast and the continued imprisonment of Hassan Is re-aoting unfavourably on the Shaikh of Deb&amp;i. Hassan's family: is said to be impoverished as a result of his long absence. The Shaikh of Debai offered to go bail for the good bel^viour of Hassan should he be restored. B.I. Debt. The Shaikh requested that the settlement of Customs dues by the B.I.3.H. Co. should be expedited. He remarked that he had been pressed to make good the Company^ claim for compensation on acooont of the dhow looted by his townsmen last year, and hoped that the political authorities would ensure that the dues were now paid to him. The amount involved is believed to be about Hupees 12,000 and is the total of dues levied on merchandise Which remains more than a fortnight at Debai Custome House. The Shaikh was instructed to forward a detailed olaisi through the Residency Agent. (d) Local Debts. The leader of the Indian merchants requested me to bring to your notice that the Indian merchants of Debai were owed a total of about-Rupeea 21,000 by various townspeople. He also was told to forward any letter on this subject through the Residency Agent. Debt owed to a?ial£h. This is apparently a private affair of long standing. It was unoevetoed that an ex-Wall of Rhassab stayed with the Shaikh some ten years ago and prevailed upon him to set him up in business as a pearl broker. Rupees 10,000 were advanced by the Shaikh for this purpose, but the broker later returned to Muscat, and has only repaid Rupees dhows or cargoes belonging to Muscat, which might call at Debai, a course of action he apparently contemplated. He was advised to write it off as a bad debt. for your information. 2,000. The Shaikh was Informed that this \ ae entirely a personal matter and that he must not take any retaliatory steps against (oontd.)(3) ,^D 3. The ahallch appeared very friendly, and aent off » present of heef, whioh was reolprooated In tenne of tinned iruit». 4. aHAHJt-H. .flat and placid, this Shaikh had nothing of Interest to report. He was chiefly concerned In replenishing his supply of foodstuffs from the Canteen and obtaining medical assistance for his digestion. 5. AL AJhAfl. Here again, the Shaikh reported all to be well. . He said that he was suffering from malaria, and certainly appeared none too fit. A stock of quinine v.ti.s I 0 . 1 t vi »h him. 6. UMK AL QUA III. Orosa in person and apparently lact.ing in intelligence, the Shaikh was certainly the least attractIre personality on the ooaat. He did not say anything on his own InltlatiTe, but judging from his replies to questions, appears contented and secure at the moment# 7 # MS AL This visit ms most euaoeesful and as it included a motor tour of part of his territory, it would appear that the shaikh rules a more fruitful and attractive country than do his neighbours on the coast* 8. It 'was apparent that he wished to be friendly and though at first a little nervous as to whether his past behaviour would prove a handicap, he soon lost this reserve and proved most intelligent and entertaining host* r ihe visit to the Shaikh's date garden some ten miles from the town, was made at hit suggestion, and was accomplished in the Hesideney Agent's *orc car, which crossed the scrubby, hummocky plain in the most efficient manner and without damage* 9. The Shaikh was obviously pleased at the geologist's impending visit and seemed just as anxious to find artesian water as oil* It was explained that the visit was only preliminary, and that no detailed examination could be made during the summer* 10* In the more informal atmosphere of his date garden, the Shaikh explained that his past refusal to call on H*li* Ships and Political officers was due to the way in which he had been forced to allow a petrol barge to be moored in his lagoon. It was also understood that some of his pearling dhows had been blockaded at the time to ensure his acquiesenoe. 11. r I?he Shaikh wished for information on two questions (a) Use of landing ground* (b) Position of petrol barge. (contd.)(a) Use of landln£ ground. It appears that some tltie ago an Imperial Airwajrs liner lanoed and spent the night at Has al Khaimah, The Shaikh sent out a guard, and was later informed by Isa that the Company were pleased with the action he had taken and that he would rooeire hupees 150. This has not yet eventuated, and the Shaikh wished to know whether the report was true. (b) Position of Petrol Barge. The Shaikh wished to more the barge to a position off his fort - a dietanoe of about one mile from its present position* He said there was Just as much room there and the water was, if anything, deeper. His reason is that in its present position, dhows are continually passing the barge by day and night, and as the lagoon is narrow they must pass fairly close alongside. One night recently, his guard fired on a dhow which fouled and was thought to be doming alongside the barge, one man was injured, and the Shaikh had to pay Rupees 400 compensation. 1£. The Shaiispras informed that his guard appeared unduly quick to fire on that occasion but that his request would be forwarded to Ho*£o3 Squadron for consideration. 13. I entirely concur with the Shaikh's request* The present position of the barge and its armed guard, endangers all dhows navigating the lagoon. The Residency Agent's men would not go near it at any price owing to the guard. The suggested position further up the lagoon where dhows do not go fs better, clearer and there are unlikely to be incidents, and I strongly recommend that the petrol barge should be moved to the new position at earliest possible moment. 14. Pearling. With the exception of the Shaikh of Qatar, all the remaining Shaikhs visited reported that the season so far was proving better than last year. 15. ?ly general impression of the Truolal Coast Shaikhs was as follows Ab u Dhabi. Has brains, enterprise and is a live wire. Requires more tactful handling, and if taken the right way and care is exercised not to give him offence, I am of opinion that we Gan always get what we want from him. Bebal. Has more experience than the rest, aged 51, a confirmed Intriguer, friendly to us, and has a lot of power up and down the coast, largely owing to his control of the Trucial Coast Trade. Ujp&gt;al&gt;Quain&gt; Al AJman and aharjah. exist, contented and unlikely to cause trouble at any time. General, Respect for the susceptibilities of the is the key to getting whatever is desired. x x xx (eontd.)7 • ««. X X X X X ABU DRkBI - QIL&gt; jjuring the exchange of oalXe vrith the ahaikliof Abu Dhabi on 18th July 193S, the latter mentioned the prospect of finding artesian water and/or oil in his Shaiichdom* ihe following account of the conversation is forwarded, at the Shaikh's request, for your information. £• At first the Shaikh wished to know the relative merits of the geologists at ICishia and Mr. 0fx 9 who visited Abu Dhabi last December. On hearing that they were both oonel&amp;ered to be good experienced men, he then asked whether they compared with the American geologists who found oil at Bahrain. on this point he was reassured. 3. The dhalkh then went on to aeal with events in this connection at Abu Dhabi. He explained how Mr. Cox advised him that artesian water might be found at £00 feet and said that later he had a visit from Mr. Williamson who predicted 1000 feet, and assured the Shaikh that his Company would drill for him. 4. It appears that this change of opinion did not impress the Shaikh who seems to have felt that it was merely a clumsy attempt on the part of the Company to carry out test drilling for oil. He said that if water was available at both levels, he would employ a contractor to drill to £00 feet first. In fact, throughout the interview, the tfhaikh demonstrated clearly that he was no fool where his possible financial Interests were concerned 5. About this stage, it seems that two letters from Major Holmes of the Kuwait Oil Company reached Abu Dhabi. The 4 latter, in a straightforward manner which appears to have favourably impressed the Shaikh, said he thought there was a chance of finding oil in Abu Dhabi territory, that if the irv&gt; agreed he would send a geologist, and also mentioned that he was experienced in Gulf oil having found the deposits in Bahrain and Hejd. Major Holmes also informed the Shaikh that he was prepared to come to Abu Dhabi himself in mid-August, and to send a geologist at any time of year. 6. The Shaikh, who was under the impression that Major Holmes was an American, asked whether he would be able to oonolude a private business agreement with him without incurring the wrath of H.M. Government. It was then pointed out that his Treaty engagements precluded him from granting any concessions of this nature without H.M. Government's consent, and that an oil concession, liable to affect his whole sheikhdom^ could not be considered as a matter of private business. This view he professed to unaerstand.7* It «&amp;• farther points out to th« tiiat fcajor Hoiaoe w&amp;« l^ngltah, bat ha4 Amor loan par inert t and that it waa im&lt;iaratoo4 that h« mx* now la London arranging for &amp;» entiroXy LngXiah ooncerzu Alao that unleew lajor Holloa had found auch a corapany ho would not be allowed to hare any ooneeealoxi la Abu Jhabl by E.M.

He mentioned that bubbles of oil hsd been seen la the water around one or »ore of his oo&amp;etal islands and that a tarry deposit had also been washed ur^on their shores* It was understood that these lairds were situated between Abu Lhabi and fas but the 3hal&amp;h ms most definite that no outsider should investigate without hie pemlssion* He oomplained ef having been treated oavalierly in this reapeot by former A«P*0«C* investigators 9 and it is suggested that if the shaikh is treated with taet and courtesy In this respect, better results will aesrus 10 • au&amp;w&amp;rlse, the dhalkht* (a) wishes his territory to be exmdned for oil preferably by lajor Bolmes in whom he believes, but he is wining that an A*B.0*C. geologist should do thle first, should P,K. so prefer, and no delays are entailed* (b) Wishes to negotiate a oonoesalon with Major Molmos if olitiOHl resident will allow it* (o) Haa been promised a letter or visit from Major Holmes by B&amp;d-August. (d) Is jealous of his prerogative and wishes any geologist sent to obtain hie permission to ueareh in areas desired, before doing so* 11* I found the shaikh very friendly, obviously sorry for his provious misdeeds and anxious to make amends; very anxious for dlsousslon on his problems which lasted 40 minutes; with a keen business instinct, intelligent and quick on a point; he Is touchy ones resentful of any slight on his ohaUchly dignity*of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council extracts from the Persian Gulf Intelligence Report for the month of June, 1935.

Before leaving llohammerah, bazaar gooaip was to effect that *PALAMQ' was b ing sent to capture Bnsidu. (Bushire &amp; Mohammerah Int. Heports.) 3. Inhabitants ex-Baeldu . Most of the male inhabitants ex-Basidu were employed on construction worh rt the new naval base, Jufair, Hard worfc: does not appeal to them however, and although they intimated th*t they would not be averse to accepting posts of supervision, such situations were not ova liable. 5?he number employed has therefore dwindled to two. ('BIBEPOHD'.) ****** Abu Dhabi . 6. A possible reason for the hhalich attempting to break his agreement as regards the granting of air facilities at Abu Dhabi is as follows. She present Shaikh is not the real heir to the shaikhdom, but rules for hie uncle, who prefers a quiet life to the earee and dangers of office. He is well aware that his predecessor w*e murdered, and l^et a like fate befall him f he pays certain Bedouin tribes of the interior for their support in the event of trouble. These people are strongly averse to aircraft, as not only do they observe the Arab womenfolk from above, but also the Bedouins argue that it is fooliwh to present s potential enemy with a landing ground in one's own territory. 7. It is thought, therefore, that after signing the Agreement and ensuring for himself a regular monthly income, he had to face the extreme disapproval of his Bedouin allies, and possibly the withdrawal of their support. Threats from the British on one hand, and the reproaches rsnd opposition of hie former friends on the other, might well have caused any man to lose his temper, particularly when he thought his life depended on the correct solution of the problem. 8* Has al khnimah . The Shaikh recently informed political Besident that he would call on the next ship visiting his town. To test this, 'FOWSY', with the Officiating Political /gent, Bahrain onboard, visited Ha« M lOiainah towards the end of June. Calls were exchanged, and the shaikh is reported to have been very friendly. 9. The Honourable the political resident hns therefore requested the Anglo*Iranian Oil Company to send some geologists to Has A1 JQiaimah in mid-July. Although it will be rather hot et this time end s thorough Invest!gution will not be possible until the autumn, the presence of the geologists will be a suitable 'gestw It will be remembered that when 'BOUC* HVILLE” visited R./ .X* the Shaikh asked Admiral Rive to send a French geologist. Such a course would have been most undesirable. ('FOfcEY' and Hon. the Politic*! Resident.)10. Bu Hues. Golclen Valley Oohre &amp; Oxide Qouykxw . Mr. Barnett left the island early In June and will not be returning until the euturon ee the Company fine that their annuf 1 rectuiremente can be met by woricing the deposits in the winter months only. Between 400 and 600 tone of oxide were shipped to Knglnnh at the end of May, Owing to hie ability to speak English, a young Persian from Sirri island was taken on ae foreman. *fhe Bu liusms aid not take kindly to suoh foreign supervision ana after acousing him of being a Persian epy, they attacked him with shovels. He has now returned to Sirri nursing a damaged arm. ('JPOWBY'. ) ****** qatak , 12. Shaikh 1 a Health . 1'he Shaikh, who is elderly, is suffering from a form of eosema. He wae treated a few months *go by a sloop * s doctor and more recently by one from the Arabian Mission. The latter reports that although this desease is curable if the Shaikh alters his habits, he prefers his present dissolute life. ****** KUWAIT . Keactlons of Iraq AU;turbanoea . As a result of the withdrawal of Iraq troops from the area near Basrah to proceed to the Euphrates Valley t the desert nomads considered the time ripe for a return to their old habits of raids and counter raids. One *f the Shaikhs arrived at a desert encampment and ©eked, '*why are you *11 leading such a quiet and peaceful life when the*Iraq Government have gone and the buthem aeeert is now open to us to raid, loot and kill as we please.^ Although this man was arrested by the hhaikh of Kuwait, hie opinion appears to have been followed, and many bancs of r^iners h- ve been stealing the frt camels of Auwr.it* The khaikh h&gt; *; forbidden oounter-raida, but h^s organised armed car patrols and several spirited actions hfve restated.

If they were taken by some other person he would have kept them with him and then returned them as being unfit (for service^* The reason was that whenever anyone wanted to buy them they used to show themselves to be unfit which made the purchasers to refrain from buying them. When Ibrahim Islam heard about them he aa^ed us to send them to him and after seeing them he returned them without asking any offer whatsoever.

This man has been in Muscat gaol for the past seven years on account of his flouting the Sultanas authority in that he refused to allow survey parties from ORMCKBE to land near Khassab in 1929.

He was also most grateful for the action of French Charge d ? Affaires who write to all important officials in Syria telling them to do all in their power to make his journey across French mandated territory as comfortable as possible. 9. The Shaikh also attended a conference with members of the Iraq Government. The latter’s concern that many of the rifles used by the rebels in the recent Euphrates rebellion had reached them via Kuwait, was denied by the Shaikh, who said he had done everything in his power to prevent arrrs smu ggling. He suggested that many of the rifles were smuggled fromsaudi irabia. As regards other commodities, the Shaikh once again averred that smuggling was mainly carried on by Iraq subjects and that the only remedy was the erection of customs posts and armed car patrols. 10. The Political Agent, Kuwait reports that*he is frequently asked whether H.M.Government are making the same ,T fuss M over the Shaikh of Kuwait as the newspapers report that the Amir Baud is receiving. He is also questioned rerarding the Shaikh’s return, for the more ignorant Kuwaiti, who knows somethin^ of the ways of Governments in this part of the world, is inclined wto suspect that their Shaikh has been ordered to London where he will be detained by H.M. Government. (Kuwait Int. Report). 11. Saudi Blockade Commission , tfith reference to previous summaries, the Saudi Commission arrived in Kuwait in mid-June. By the end of the month, it was clear that a compromise could not be effected and the delegates finally left Kuwait early in July. 12. The Kuwaitis were anxious to re-open trade with Saudi Arabia and were willing to pay full customs dues on all ^oods crossing the frontier and to ensure that no caravans should leave Kuwait town unless armed with a manifest. 13. Throughout the negotiations the Saudi delegates adopted an over-bearing attitude and appeared to have no inteniion of allowing the conference to succeed. They insisted that as a preliminary to any agreement, Kuwait must guarantee in writing that all smuggling would cease. On further questioning it was discovered that 'all smuggling' included an 'individual smuggler', when the Kuwaitis pointea out'that it was quite impossible to give such a guarantee, but that they would do their best to stop s^ggling into Saudi-Arabia, the delegates of the latter place were not content and refused to consider any agreement. (Kuwait Int. Report). 14. Political Agent Kuwait, considers that Bin Baud did not intend the conference to succeed. He suggests that the only method of bringing the blockade to an end is by imposing full duty at Bahrain. This might however lead to the development of Eas Tanurah and the transfer of more Saudi cargoes to foreign shipring. / 15. n£-g.gt,iQn.3 .of, Iraq Liaturhances . idth reference to paragraph 14 of June ^mmary the Kuwait authorities continued active measures against inter-tribal raiding during June, and numbers of camels have been recaptured and returned to Tneir rightful Owners.

Opinion appears divided as to whether men will be sent to Nejran where there are rumours of trouble, or to the Kuwait boundary to strengthen the blockade. 45.

I Sir, Your obedient Servant,22 • • • SECRET. x x r EXTRACTS. • x x X TR0CIAL COAST. Debai• In May 1934 a dhow loaded with cargo from a B.I. Steamer went aahore when trying to enter Debai harbour in bad weather. The dhow was subsequently looted and the owners of the goods naturally complained to the Shaikh. The latter said that he would enaeavour to retrieve the goods or obtain compensation. So far he has been unsuccessful. 2. Recently, Shaikh Juma, the brother of the Ruler of Debai, visited the Political Agent, Bahrain, and in referring to the above unsatisfactory affair, accused his (Juma*a) cousins of being implicated. (Bahrain Int. Report). 3 . It will be remembered that these same cousins attempted to depose the Shaikh last September, and presumably this is one of their methods of undermining his authority. It seems possible that Juma fears that there will be further trouble with the cousins in the not-distant future. 4 . Shaikh Juma also reported that he had met Bin Saud at Mecca and that the latter had received him cordially. 1 5» Bu Musa. Golden Valley Ochre &amp; Oxide Company^ j In continuation of para .30 of I/.arch-April xieport, Mr. Barnett recently experienced some annoyance due to the action of the Shaikh of Sharjah. The latter insisted that the Bu Musian labourers should be changed round fortnightly so that all should receive in turn the daily payment of eight annas. As it takes at least a week to train a man, such a system appears uneconomic, but fortunately the male inhabitants are few, and all have now served their apprenticeship. ('LUPIN”) • 6. Has al Nhaimah• The Residency Agent reports that the Shaikh has sent a letter to the Honourable the Political Resident requested that a geologist should visit Ras al Khaimah. This seems to suggest that the Shaikh is at last changing his policy towards H.M. Govt., a view which received support from the Residency Agent. ('LUPIN'). xxx X, X X KUWAIT. 20. Kuwait - Iraq Smuggling . Syed Hamid Beg, the Iraqi Deputy for Basrah, when calling on the Political Agent, Kuwait at the end of April had much to say on this question. 21. He considered that the only just course for his government to adopt was to set up Customs posts along the Kuwait- Iraq frontier, the intervening gaps being watched by car patrols. Such a preventative system, coupled with a genuine effort on the part of Irfis to cultivate more friendly relations with Kuwait would, he thought, be a satisfactory solution to the problem.57 . * * 2 hlS 22• Hi® view® appear to have gained official sanction lor in mid-May it was reported that a car patrol had intercepted some ®muggler® and in the ensuing action six customs men t three Iraqi smugglers were killed* The contraband was captured* 25. Silver Jubilee Celeb rations. The Shaikh decreed that 6th May should - be a holiday, and most of inhabitants together with a number of visiting Bedouins attended the horse racing, sword dances and war games held to celebrate the occasion* His Excellency also disbursed alma to the poor, and in addition gave the 300 oldest and poorest of his subjects a good square meal * 24. Tribal Movements* Many of the nomad Bedouin tribes from Iraq and Hasa are at present camped in and around Kuwait territory* The chief reason for this move is that the grasing in Kuwait is particularly good this year, while in Iraq and parts of Hasa there is not sufficient to support the local tribes throughout the year. They are therefore keeping such as there is in reserve until the autumn. Meanwhile the tribes draw their supplies from Kuwait town, a fact which cause® Bin Saud some annoyance. (Kuwait Int. Report). 25 . Bin Saud is reported to be secretly subsidising some of the Iraq tribal Shaikhs, particularly in the Shammar region. Most of the nomads are very dissatisfied with the treatment they receive from the Iraq Government, as the recent rising in the Euphrates Valley proves, and it appears possible that some of the tribes may transfer their allegiance to Bin Saud whose prestige at the moment is reported to stand very high in Arab opinion. 26. Iraq Rebellion* The rebellion caused considerable excitement In Kuwait ancT among the nomad tribes. Exaggerated rumours were rife, among them being the report that British aeroplanes and armoured cars were operating against the rebels. Stringent censorship of the Iraqi papers increased rather than lessened the excitement. 27* The Shaikh of Kuwait issued orders that no rifles or ammunition were to be sold to Iraqi tribesmen and prescribed the direst penalties for any disobedience of this order. It is reported, however, that 15 camels laden with rifles passed up the Euphrates Valley a few days before the rebellion broke out. (Kuwait Int. Report). XXX XX 36 36 . Anglo-Persian frontier in Baluchistan* In continuation of paras.4J-4b of February Report, a conference was held at Zahidan in mid-February but little was accomplished* There were three further cases of attacks on lorry convoys during March, two in British and one in Persian territory* The tribe concerned, who rejoice in the name of the Yarmuhammadsais, live on the Anglo-Persian border. Although after one of the above attacks, an attempt was made to hand over two raiders captured in British territory 1 the Persian authorities declined to take them. (R.A.F* Int. Report)*37* Afghanistan* With reference to previous reports, the Turkish arbitration Commission has not yet Issued any award in the Perso-Afghan frontier question. In consequence of the uncertainty as to the exact boundary, a fresh dispute has now arisen. J 8 . It is understood that the reason for delay is because the Persians would not agree to the Commission^ proposals, and the lurks wish to make an arrangement suitable to both sides. (R.A.F. Int. Report). XX XXX PERSIAN NAVY * 41. Henlam. It is reported that a non-commissioned officer and 15 _ men (non-conscript) were sent to Henjam in 'PAI-iiNG' on 12th April. It seems likely that they may have forestalled the Army in the use of the late Officers* Club and Canteen buildings. 42. 'PALAKCM a' Armament . The barrel of one of the 'PALANG’s' guns is reported to have split. Although there are many rumours as to how and when this occurred, nothing definite is known as yet. When at Bombay, the gun was inspected and it was then seen to be in very bad condition Internally, pitting being extensive. 43 . Conscription. About 45 men were recruited from Mohammerah and district during April and they are now training at the Naval Barracks. The conscription law will also affect the Bahraini subjects residing at Gusba, near Mohammerah, for although they hold Government of Bahrain nationality papers, they were forced to take out 'siJills' also. An officer has been sent to Gusba to bring back those Bahrainis who are considered due for service. 44ishnminspBh ImHt rieproi’tl - . 44. New Construction. The naval tug 'NEYROTJS' towing two dumb lighters arrived at Aden on 10th Hay and left four days later for Mohammerah. *5 • Movesrents . Unusual activity was shown by the Navy during the month, five ships being at sea at the same time. It is presumed that at this period, when ships were in company, opportunity was taken to carry out exercises. PERSIAN ARMY. 46 . Strength. It is estimated that the present strength jaf £he Army is about 80,000 and it is believed that the Shah eventually hopes to increase this figure to 100,000 men. « 47 . Training. The standard of training is difficult to assess, but It Is probably better in the Tehran garrison than in the provinces. At Tehran, training off the barrack square is confined to movements of units up to one battalion, and a very little weapon training. In the latter connection, it has been estimated that not more than 10 rounds per rifle are expended each vear. As reported in the November Summary manoeuvres were held near Tehran, but no foreign observers were allowed to be present.4 48. New Material. Artillery, machine gun«, rifle* and armoured cars are reported to have been bought recently, as well as a quantity of machinery for the ammunition factories I at Parchin and Tehran. 49 . Supply and Transport. These services have not kept pace with the expansion of the Army and the number of M.T. vehicles is quite inadequate for important operations. 50 . Although the cost of the Army accounts for such a large proportion of the country’s finances. His Imperial rlajesty* s policy in maintaining such a large force appears to be successful# It probably overawes some of the malcontents (tae Baluchis are certainly an exception at present) and undoubtedly instils a certain amount of respect among Persia’s neighbours. particularly Iraq.

We weighed at 1030 to intercept the 'Up slow” mail and seeing a dhow approaching from the North-West we stopped and boarded her about two miles from the Island. (Dhow , B* in enclosure). There was nothing of interest on board the dhow beyond the fact that she was taking 20 passengers evading conscription from Persia to the Trucial coast. She subsequently anchored on the West (lee) side of the Island* The mail steamer was then closed and one rating, mails, and provisions were collected. Meanwhile another Dhow was seen to be approaching Tunb from the North, and as it anchored on the West (lee) side of the Island we anchored there and boarded it. (Dhow ’C' in enclosure).

The Nakhoda of M Dhow C” came on board in a shore boat to say that when the wind went round to the West the previous day, he and 'Dhow B' found themselves on a lee shore. He weighed and got clear but 'Dhow B' was too late and was driven ashore, becoming a total wreck but without loss of life. 'Dhow C' appeared to have had a pretty bad time and lost most of his sail. As he was employed by the Clerk in Charge, Henjam, he was given some rope and food to make good defects, and was advanced Rupees 25 which he wanted to buy the sail salved from 'Dhow B', He subsequently made good defects and left for Henjam that evening.

The presence of 29 Persians, evading the law of their land, was extremely undesirable in Tunb at the time. TheThe Tunb natives would not give the refugees food and demanded Rupees 1, Annas 8 , a head for dhow transport to Sharjah* On the other hand the refugees said they had no money and were starving.

It was a Persian Sarahuk from Khameer, Nakhoda named Gholam Hussein. Left Khameer on 24th January for Oman Coast with cargo of lime. Reached Tunh on 27th January on way to Dehai, then got blown away and had to jettison half his cargo, eventually sheltering at Dastaku in Qishrn. He waited 4 days at Dastaku and as he had friends there he frequently landed to visit them. Sailed for Debai on 6 th February and reached Tunb this (7th) morning. His papers appeared in order and included a clearance from Kharaeer to Debai. He had no arms, and no passengers. He had now come to Tunb to buy fish as he was short of provisions and was going on to Debai as soon as wind was favourable. The Nakhoda and most of the crew landed and their movements ashore were followed; nearly all seemed to get their hair cut. They left Tunb that afternoon.c«D 490 H.M.S. BIDKPQRD .

The passengers were Persians of military age eva' g conscription and seeking refuge at Sharjah. 3. The Nakhoda (Yousef Ahmed) said he was calling at Tunb to get water, his tank having capsized and a lot of water lost (this was confirmed). 4. One rifle was discovered; beyond the fact ^hat it belonged to a passenger its ownership culd not ' • ascertained as the passengers were all extremely s a sick, some 'being barely conscious. 5. The dhow subsequently anchored on the West (lee) side of Tunb. a on Vr»idav nicht ( 8 th) it came on to blow hard from the Eastward continuing until the following midday when the wind veered to South and then blew for a short time from the S.W. 7 . On the afternoon of the 9th when the wind went round to the South-West, the dhow found hersdf on a lee shore and tried to put to sea. But she was too late, and was driven ashore becoming a total wreck. No one was drowned, but the passengers and crew lost all their food and belongings. They were given shelter in the mosque on the island. 8 . News of the loss only reached me on Sunday (10th) and on the 11 th I sent ashore to enquire into the plight of the refugees. ^ It was blowing too hard to get people off that aay, but on 12th I sent in and had the Nakhoda, 1 passenger, and the acting Headman of Tunb brought oil for investigation. 9 . The presence of 29 Persians, evading the laws of their Country in Tunb, was particularly embarrassing at this time, and their speedy evacuation was a matter of Imoortance.n OF SEARCH OF DHOW 'B' (ContlPU»a)♦ Enquiries showed that the refugees were nearly penniless and very short of food; that even if the refugees could pay for It there was not enough food In Tunb to supply them; and that the price demanded by the Tunb dhow owners to take the refugees to Sharjah could not be raised• 11. The acting Headman of Tunb was given a short homily on charity to shipwrecked mariners, and the shipwrecked mariners were told that, if the present negotiations failed, the only way I could help them was to summon a Persian gunboat to their aid• The party was sent ashore then to think the matter over Reason apparently prevailed, as the shipwrecked people all left in a Tunb dhow the following evening, in the direction of Sharjah.BISaFORD .

At 1400 L'T. on 8th February a one masted Jolliboat dhow with a white band round it approached from the Nothward and anchored on the West (lee; aide of the Island. It was boarded and searched and was found to be empty. The Hakhoda and two of his crew were brought on board for investigation, the former bringing his papers with him. On their arrival on board I first examined the papers which consisted of (a) Three private letters from Indian members of Mr .Telle s staff at Hen jam to members of the Tunb Lighthouse crew. checked and found correct. (c) A pink Persian 'Fermls de Depart'. I then interrogated the Hakhoda, the following being a summary of his statement:* (a) He left Hen jam with orders from Mr.Telles to proceed to Tunb via Khanl and deliver letters to the lighthouse crew. (b) While at Khani he was to find out if there were any letters or parcels there to take to Tunb, and if so he was to take them and remain at Tunb. (o) He went to Khanl and met the headman of that village (Abdul al Hassan) who asked him what he was going to do. (d) The Hakhoda replied that he had come from Surl near Bundar Abbas and was going to Tunb to embark a cargo of stones for Sharjah. (e) The Headman said he had a parcel for Mahaood and asked the Hakhoda to deliver it. The Hakhoda said he would take it. (f) The Headman then added that he wanted Mahmood 9 s receipt for the letter, and the Hakhoda replied that he would require a small fee for bringing back the receipt. (b) A list of names of the Hakhoda («)/m (g) To this the Headoan replied that as he had xxo authority to make any suctj payxaent ha ^ould h^ve to take the letter himself, adding that eithe,r_he or hia son would probably tike t he letter to WhZZb* at funFln the oouree of tne ne xi few dajrs aT~soon aa wind was favourable ; (h) The Headman also informed the Hakhoda that he haa asked a Tunb Islander a fee days previously to take the letter to iflahmood but the Islander had refused. 6. Th. following point, wore elicited from the Nakhoca in r.ply to ay qu..tlon.s- (.) 00 (o) («) (•) (f) (g) 0 ») (i) (J) (k) The Hakhoda asked for the extra fee for bringing back the reeeipt to the headman, aa he wished to avoid the appearance of being too eager to gain possession of the letter. He heard that the letter was brought from Bund ar Abb to Salagh by a man called Shaikh Obeid, son of Ataba. He did not see the letter but understood it was e sealed envelope. Details for delivery of the letter were not arranged, but the Hakhoda heard that when the previous negotiations were in progress between the ^ headtu'-. n and the Tunb Islander, the Headman he.d stipulated that the letter was to be handed to Mahmood anc to no- one else. The Headman thinks Mahmood is at Tunb, and does not know a sloop is stationed at the Island. The Headman did not say why he or his son were now bringing the letter personally. The Headman (Abdul al Hasaan) is an old man with white whiskers and eyebrows, thin face and medium height, wearing a turban. The eon is darker, clean shaved, has a long nose, medium height and girth, and wears a turban. The Hakhoda does not know what dhow the Headman will coma in, but nrobably in a ^jollyboat' or a 'bakara' (one mast). The headman*a own boat is beached for caulking, but could be got ready in a day or two. f The Nakhoda’a crew know nothing of the intention to get the letter, nor of its existence. 7. I told the Hakhoda that we would give no indication to the crew that he was doing anything of which they were unaware• 8. The two members of the crew were then Interrogated in order/4^ IT) order to allay any suspicion they might hoye in regard to any private understanding between myself and the Hakhoda, and several questions regarding traffic in arms were put to them to start a false soent.

Tuesday 5th Marsh• The interpreter went ashore and returned with the Sheikh who same on board to call. He asked for, and obtained the usual medical and other facilities, in return for which I took his photo. The Sheikh was saluted on leaving the ship. The Residency Agent had returned the day before from his visit to Bahrein and sent off a message asking to be excused calling as he was unwell. Hussein, too, was absent as he was seeing the Political Agent of Bahrein off by air from Debai. I landed with the Sub.Lieutenant in the afternoon to return the Sheikh’s call, and tried to 'draw' the Sheikh in regard to the position at Tunb, but as he showed no inclination to volunteer any information or opinion regarding it, I let the matter drop. Hussein met me on landing end came to the Sheikh’s palace, after which he conducted me to the Residency Agent’s house, as I wanted to meet Isa. Isa seemed worse than when I met him in mid-January. Apparently both the Political Resident, and the Political Agent Bahrein had seemed rather sceptical about Isa’s ill-health and had sent querulous enquiries as to why he was not going about more on the Truolal Coast. lea, therefore (according to hla own statement), thought the beet answer would be a personal demonstration and went off to Bahrein where he mst both the Political Officers. He telle ms that his visit had the desired effect, and that both the Political Agent Bahrein now believe him. He added that Ur .Holmes had been able to do but little for his ailment. lee/m (S^) Isa said he was going to Ras al Khaimah as soon as he was well enough to travel and would urge the Sheikh to replace the flagstaff at Tunb* He will also collect any information that he can, and if there is anything to report on his return he will make the signal n I am ready’* to H•Bu.S • BUHFOHD as he has dona on prewtous occasions § I told him that as soon as practicable after receipt of this signal a sloop will wlslt him to collect his report* (It is not anticipated that the signal will be nsde before 15th March).

The Sheikh paid his call on board that evening, and was saluted on his departure with 8 guns. During the forenoon of 9th February the Political Agent and I returned the call of the Sheikh. We found Mr.Barnett of the Golden Talley Ochre and Oxide Company installed on the island and preparing to commence operations. I left Bu Musa at noon on 14th February for Bahrain, arriving at the latter in the afternoon of 15th February, where I found the French Sloop BOTJOAlNYILLS, wearing the Flag of Centre-Admiral Rivet, Commanding the Naval Division of the Levant, already at anchor. I saidted his flag and the salute was duly returned. The Political Agent, Bahrain, was disembarked on arrival and accorded a salute of 11 guns. In view of the Sheikh having been troubled with exchange of official calls with the French Admiral on the 15th February, the Political Agent suggested to the Sheikh that he might like to postpone exchange of calls with me and to this he agreed. The usual visits of courtesy were exchanged with BOUOAimLLS and I took luncheon with the Rear Admiral, BOUGAINVILLE sailing later in the afternoon for Bushlre. Rear Admiral Rivet Informed m that, on his landing at Ras-al-Khaimah, the Sheikh was on the foreshore to meet him, though evidently unaware of the ship f s nationality, as he enquired If it was a British ship. I understand from Colonel Loch that the Sheikh enquired if France and Britain were at war.Leaving Henjam at 0700 we arrived Tunb at 1080* tmd aa we approached a signal was received froa the lighthouse that a Ihow had arrived from ilas al haiaah and was mohored near the village* So we 9 toof anchored on the south aide of the Island and the dhow was hoarded* It proved to be &gt;how again (see end sure) which had returned from Has al Khalaah with a party of 6 tax collectors* TU!tB 9 Monday 11th March* The interpreter landed and discovered there had been diffcjMnicea of opinion be toe n 1 ahiaood and the Lii^hthouse deeper* It had been ay Intention to go on to Basidu but the trouble ashore and the arrival of tax collectors made it desirable to remain ana Investigate* SO Kahaoodt the Lighthouse Keeper and uliaan the water carrier were sent for and on investigation was held &gt;n board in the afternoon* flahnood had accused the Indian lighthouse men of associating with Suliaan's wife # and the ighthouse Keeper accused Mahaood of trying to extort taxes from the Indiana and threatening to shoot thesu The matter was thrashed out on heal'd and the principals fine ly shook hunue and promicsed to be frienda* XX X X The Flret Lieutenant landed during the forenoon to find out if the peace was being kept # an also whether the 5 tax collectors had imposed any new taxes; their meeting for that purpose had been fixed for the previous evenia;* On landing* it w^a discovered that a lunch party was being held at ’-he llshthouae at which the gueat of 18th-.ll, Ql . , ^ b. honour/0&gt;)/ hon ur was Mahmood who was supported by the five tax collectors. As regards the taxes after considerable argument Suliman agreed to pay Rupees 10 a year to the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah as tax on his pay for carrying water to the lighthouse. This has not yet been paid as the Sheikh's concurrence in the smaller amount is first necessary. Taxes were extracted from the Fisherman on the island and the 5 tax collectors left in the evening for Ras al Khaimah. They will return after I D D to collect Suliman's tax. WKm i3DAY f 15th M/UCH . Basldu . Leaving Tuhb at 0740 we anchored at Basidu at 1130. Previous to our arrival an engagement had been announced between the First Lieutenant's servant, f/ohammed Abdulla Moussa, only son of Abdulla Mohammed Moussa of British Basidu, and Fatima, daughter of Hassan Kalali of Persian Basidu. The respective ages of bridegroom and bridge are 20 and 14. The wedding had been arranged to take place at an early date, and as the respective parents were well satisfied with the match, it was confidently expected that the ceremony would be performed during H.M.S. BIBKFORD's present visit. Preparations, moreover, were so well advanced that the time of the service was fixed for 2200, and Mohammed Abdulla Moussa* s leave was accordingly extended to 0600 to enable the honeymoon to be spent in British Basidu. But when the prospective bridgroom landed, he discovered that, owing to a temporary financial embarrassment, his father was unable to pay the first instalment of Rupees 100 demanded, in accordance with local custom, by the bride's father. So the wedding was postponed for a year, and an impromptu reception was held instead at the Moussa home the principal guest being the prospective bridegroom's employer. The interpreter, meanwhile, was engaged in the more prosaic occupation of gaining local intelligence,and reports that he obtained the following information from Ali Hafaz, the caretaker, and from his brother Hussein Hafazs- (a) On about 6th March a Persian motor dhow anchored off British Basidu and the Inspector of Customs who was on board asked the Mudir why the Senior Naval Officer had taken Hussein Hafaz away. The Mudir said he did not know, and the dhow then went on to Lingeh.(to) A few days later an official called Sheikh Atodullah (son of Sheikh Salih) was sent with a letter from the Governor of Qishm town to the Headman of Persian Basidu telling the latter to find cmt why Hussein had 'been embarked in SHORBHAM. Hussein was sent for and when asked* replied that he went on hoard SHORKHAM to enquire about the interest on a legacy left toy Haji Khadudad for repairing the Mosque* Temples etc* He had added that the Senior Naval Officer took him to Hen;}am to see Telles and that when the Senior Uaval Officer wanted him to land he had refused to do so on the ground of difficulty in obtaining a travelling pass to return home. Hussein finally told the official that owing to his inability to find his own passage home the S#N*0* had promised to arrange it for him; that he had first gone to BIDHFORD for that purpose but as BIDKFORD did not visit Basidu, the SH0R3HAM had eventually ta&amp;en him there. THURSDAY. 14th MARCH . Basidu to Henjanu We left Basidu at 0700 and proceeded by the inner passage to Henjam* where we arrived at noon. An officer was sent ashore to inform the Deputy Governor that in honour of the Shah’s birthday, H. 1 '. Ships in harbour would dress overall the following day and would fire a salute of 21 guns at noon. On sending in a request to see the Deputy Governor the officer received a reply from the former that as he was having lunch he would not see the officer for half an hour. The officer then withdrew and was overtaken by the Deputy Governor’s orderly with a further message to the effect that as the Deputy Governor would be shaving after lunch he would not be ready to receive the officer for an hour. The officer wisely returned on board and left no message - this being subsequently delivered by the SH0:3HAM*8 interpreter the same evening. XX X FRIDAY, 15th H/l-CH . Henjam and ^unb . We left Henjam at 1240 and arrived Tunto at 1800. I landed with the interpreter to visit the lighthouse, where everything was reported to be in order and all quiet in the village. The Lighthouse Keeper reports that in conversation with the tax collectors from Has al Khaimah it was stated that Mahmood is not in favour with the Theikh, though no reason as given. X x x MONDAY, 18th MARCH• At Henjam. The interpreter reports that the Persian Government have waived the collection of taxes on land*cattle etc. in Qishm Island for the present.In addition the Oovemm nt has ordered the refund of about 3000 Rials on the tax collected last year. 2Qth soon after daylight we weighed and proceeded to anchor close in to Debai* The interpreter wee landed to tell the Shciich we had coae to pick up four R.A.v. officers who were arriving by flying boat to do a reconnaissance at Abu Ohubi. The Sheikh and I exchanged visits. He appeared quite pleased to see us and regretted we were not staying longer. He asked m where the Sultan of Muscat was, and I told him that His Highness had returned to Muscat from India. Pearl fishing had already started in a small way within a couple of miles of Debai, though tue main xleet will not be comioncing operations until next eonth. There have been a few petty robberies by Bedouins, the Sheikh said, but otherwise everything was quiet on the Coast. On conclusion of my visit to the Sheikh I was going to return to the ship by akiff, as the motor boat and other ait iff were waiting inside the Khor for the flying boat to arrive. But the incoming tide was running very fast, and the Skeihh very kindly lent me his motor launch to come off in, with the skiff in tow. The flying boat arrived on time at 1116, and four officers were brought off, Squadron header Hope from A.-U. 1 *. Hinaidi, Squadron header Fogarty from Ho,34 Squadron Shaibah, Plight Lieutenant Coates from lAargll* and Lieutenant Tutton, R.K, from Largil. We sailed as soon as these officers embarked, and with 2 boilers arrived at Abu Dhabi before dark. The interpreter landed on arrival and informed the 3helkh that we had brought some k.A. b Officers to see him, and that I should be very glad to see the helkh the following morning. THURSDAY* 31.t -*..AbU, The Sheikh was to hove come off at 0320, but at the last moment was taken ill and his brother came instead. In accordance with plane made beforehand with the 8.A.F. Officers, no mention of the reason for our visit was made at this stage, and only current topics were discussed. The Sheikh’s brother was at gx*eat pains to express the Sheikh’a regret at his sudden inability to come off, (having got as far as the boat before being taken ill). In view of this, of the fact that I was going to faeet the Gheich himself ashore, aid of the desirability of ensuring a successful reception of the proposals the k.A.F. Officers were about to make to the Sheikh, I decided to fire the full/full salute of 5 guns as hie brother left the ship. But I made it perfectly clear to the brother then and to the Sheiich later that this was not done for the brother, but only because I know the oheikh had in fact started to oome off himself and had b^en unavoidably prevented. The four R.A.P. Officers landed with me to return the call, and the Sheikh received us looking rather unwell. He had previously asked if cur Medical Officer could come ashore with us, which he did. Inside the council room the Hheikh’s uncle, Khalifa was waiting for us and took a prominent part in the proceedings. For about $ hour we sat and talked about everything except landing grounds, and then the Sheikh dismissed the bodyguard and asked the reason for our visit. I then turned over spoke ©men ship to Flight Lie\i tenant Coates and from then onwards he and the Sheikh carried on the negotiations. These lasted about J an hour, tho Sheikh was extremely affable and the outcome of the meeting was that he would give every assistance for the reconnaissance and would like it pressed on with. I was greatly imprjssed with Plight Lieutenant Coates* handling of the interview. He seemed to know exactly what he wanted and how to get it, and with the aid of hie ability to speak Arabic fluently he *:ept the whole of the 'shaikh* s party interested, amused and sympathetic. At the end of the meeting the Medical . fficer attended to the sheikh’s troubles which were genuine.(He had in fact left the room once or twice during the meeting). After lunching on board the k.A.F. Officers landed and found camels ready to talc© them and their escort to view possible sites. The reconnaissance was nearly completed that evening. Abu The R.A.V*. officers landed at 0830 to continue the reconnaissance and this being successfully completed in the afternoon, they returned on board by 1800. ^he position selected for the landing ground is about a mile inland from the village and is considered to possess a very good surface. I was informed that at a final meeting with the Sheikh before leaving Abu Dhabi, he had continued to be most friendly and repeatedly showed his anxiety for the completion of the landing ground. We left t 2130 for Debai in a rising Westerly wind.bu otsa . awm ik I went eahore for a walk in the evoning and mot the headman of the island. He told me that soon after the flagstaff was removed from Turib# the Sheikh of Sharjah summoned him and sent him to Has al Khaimah to a ale that Fheikh why he had removed the Tuhb flagstaff# The Sheikh of Has al Khaimah replied that he had ordered its removed “for a certain reason’*» after which cryptic utterance he asked the headman if he had heard any newa from Turib. The headman said he had been informed by nakhodas of dhows that a British sloop had been stationed at Tunb ever since the flagstaff had been removed. Nothing else oeems to have transpired at the meeting# and the headman then went back to Sharjah to report the result of the interview to the Fheikh# and afterwards returned to Bu Musa. Kverything on the Island of Bu Musa was peaceful# the headman said. The vlheikh of Sharjah sent over seven of his horses for grassing shout a month ago# I went over to the north end of the island to see them# and was surprised at their ill-conditioned appearance. An hour’s walk ashore and ten minutes conversation with the headman gave one an impression of happiness and prosperity compared to Turib# As regards the oxide developmentf this is at present being produced at the foot of the eastern side of the highest hill# From there it la brought half a mile by donkeys (2) to rail—head# where it is transferred to handworked trucks running on a well laid line to the F. i. comer of the island. More rails have been demanded and the whole transport will be by truck when they arrive. A dung) of about 250 tons haa been made close to the shore# and Mr. Barnett hue asked for a Btrick steamer to come and collect it in April. Water transport will be by 3 dhows belonging to Bu Musa. Mr# Barnett is the only European on the ialandf he has his Persian cook with him# and employs 15 Bu Musa rmtlves at 10 annus a day* There are about 30 more men on the island who are available and willing for employment. TJ DAY# 26th MMCjj # We left Bu Muea at 0415 and landed Mr. Barnett on Nablyu Turib at 0715* He was accompanied by our interpreter in case he met any Arabs on the island# but it was empty. ( I landed later in the forenoon and Mr, Barnett told me there was very little oxide on the island - and not worth developing. He stayed ashore until we left at tea-time# but made no further discov ^ry* The island showed signs of frequent visits} there are a good many well worn paths radiating from the centre to the sandy beaches all round. These have probably been used to collect brushwood for fuel from dead salt bu he8#and also/\ nS alao to oollect for fodder a prolific weed which cowtra the lal'ind. The weed is about 2 feet high and there are one or two bare patches where it has recently been mown. Btonea are also collected from the ialandf and in tho centre oi It is e small brackiah pond devoid of life. x x x AlJEOaas* Mr. Barnett came off in the morning to report that on 7th March he had given a letter to a visiting dhow asking one of the passengers to post it in Sharjah# to v/hic.i place the dhow was bound. The letter was addressed to Hussein, Secretary to the Residency Agent, and Mr. Barnett had Just heard from Isa’s brother that the letter had not been delivered. I investigated the matter ashore and discovered that the dhow contained the Persian Director of Customs from Bundar Abbas. x X X muqMIjt ^ath Ms^gh. We left Bu Musa at 0539 and anchored off Umm al aiwain at 09S0. Isa’s brother was given a passage in BD .TOdD bac: to the Trucial Coast. The dheikh came off to call) what en unattractive man he is! H© had little to say# which was fortunate# as he was rather short of breath. However, he was able to sk f or en ugh white paint to cover hie 60 foot ‘’barge”, and for medical comforts. The Sheikh was saluted on leaving and I landed shortly afterwards to return his call. One of the party to receive me was a former :heikh of Ras al haimah, the present ruler’s elder brother. He was quite friendly but took no part in the convursati n. This man had Just returned from Sharjah whither he had accompanied Hussein from Raa al Khaimah et the conclusion of Hussein’s mission with the ultimatum. (I subsequently heard from Hussein that the fheikh of Has al Thaimah had asked his brother to go to i.harjah to sound that Sheikh regarding any desire he might have to own Turib. Apparently the Sheikh of Sharjah was not told of the reference to himself which had been made in the ultiiautum referx»ed to above# and Ras al 'haimih s brother got little change out of the interview. On the day under report# the brother had stopped at Umra al Q&amp;iwaln on his ^ay back to Ras al haimah).Sncloaure Ho*4 in Senior Naval Officer, Persian Oulf letter No.lll/SO^ dated S7 AP^U 1936.

An opportunity occurred to discuss with Mr. Belgrave the question of custom dues# which might or might not he levied on naval and canteen stores. In the conversation that took pla e it was clear that Mr. Belgrave was quite ignorant of the internal economy and supply system in the Royal Na y# and also that he naturally wished for direct or Indirect financial benefits to accrue from the new naval base at BAHRAIN.

In the evening I attended the State Dinner given by H.E. the Governor at Government House. 12. The enthusiasm of the people of Bombay during the thr : e days Jubilee celebrations was remarkable. Crowds thronged the streets each night and the ilLaminations of both Government and private buildings were most elaborate and effective, while the appeal for subscriptions to the Silver Jubilee Fund met with a very g:nerous response. R.I.K. PAG5/JIT . 13. The R.I.N. Day Pageant, which was held in the Dockyard on 6 th, 7th, 8 th and 9th May was very well attended. The programme included displays of physical training, life saving using Breeches Buoy, diving and field gun by R.I.N. ratings, '’Retreat' and 'Alarm' by detachments from the Durham Light Infantry and .unjab Regiments, and a very popular 'Crossing the Line' ceremony by H.M.S. 'COLOMBO'. 14. 'SHOREHAM’s' searchlight was used after dark, and guides were also provided to assist in controlling the crowds. 15. I15, I attended a reception at Government House on the evening of 8 th May at which H,E. The Governor of Bombay presented Jubilee medals to a number of British and Indian residents, 16, R.I,N, Night Pageant , This was held on 17th and 18th May in the Dockyard Tidal Basin. The most spectacular item in the programme was an exhibition of manoeuvres by motor cutters, which had been most efficiently rigged to represent models of sloops. Other items were the capture and destruction of a pirate junk, and exhibition of 'away lifeboat' and a combined operation showing the defence of Bombay Fort against savages in the year 1750. 17, As a result of both Day and Night Pageants, over Rupees 6000 was raised for Their Majesties Silver Jubilee Fund.

At the end of February, the final decision was reached to evacuate Henjam and Ba&amp;du provided arrangements could he made for naval facilities at Khor Kuwai in the Mussendam Peninsula. At Bahrain, an area suitable for a naval recreational base had already been purchased. 2. The actual sequence of events was as follows:- A. NEGOTIATIONS FOR FACILITIES AT KHOR_ KUjVA l • 3. His Highness the Sultan of Muscat was first approached by the Political Agent in mid-March. Our requirements, i.e. the use of the whole island as a rest and recreational base, the erection of a few modest buildings, and possibly the mooring of an oil barge, were explained to His Highness. 4. At first the Sultan appeared pensive, and to re-assure him the Political Agent exnlained that the proposal did not involve any attempt to acquire territory, and, as at the former Coal Depot at Muscat, no flag would be flown. 5. From that moment the negotiations showed every promise of success, and when a sloop was nut at His Highness T disposal to view Khor Kuwai and also to take him to Khassab for his visit of inspection he was delighted. 6. as a result of this cruise (with a suite numbering 40) in ^SHOREHsM” His Highness gave the desired permission, his only conditions being:- (a) That his subjects should be able to visit the island. (b) That the goats, with which the island abounds, should not be interfered with. The Sultan also wished to be informed before building work commenced, and considered that the Caretaker and his assistants on the island should be armed. B. EVACUATION OF HENJaM EASID11 . 7. On the successful conclusion of the Khor Kuwai negotiations, arrangements were made to commence the work of evacuation on the same day as H.B.M. r s Minister at T&amp;iran informed the Persian Government of H.M.Government’s decision. As the notification arrived too late in ^SHOREHaM’ 1 on End April, work was commenced at daylight on 3rd Anril. Simultaneously with this announcement a communique was to be issued to the Arab Shaikhs and Indian, Iraq and Egyptian press designed to explain our reasons for the transfer and to endeavour to counteract any possible loss of prestige. 8. The evacuation of Henjam was completed on 5th April, 1935. During this period the heavy moorings for the oil A. Negotiations for facilities at Khor Kuwai. B. Evacuation of Henjam and Basidu. C. Move to Bahrain. bargesbarges were weighed, all ships f stores, coal, recreational ^ gear, club and canteen furniture, flagstaff, coal trolleys and their lines, buoys, anchors and moorings etc. were removed and placed in the oil barges and two dhows. it was decided to tow the targets, which were accordingly launched and prepared for towing. 9. Perhaps the most surprising feature of the evacuation was the complete absence of Persian interference. The practical demonstration of our intention to leave was the first news to reach the inhabitants, and although the Deputy Governor telegraphed long and frequent messages to Tehran he did not as far as we know receive any reply. In consequence he aid nothing, which possibly added to the harmony of our departure. 10. The weather broke during the work, and it was two days after comoletion before the Division, with its assorted tows of barges, targets and dhows could leave harbour. On passage to Bahrain a strong shemal reduced the speed of advance to 2 knots, and a dhow' did not reach its new haven. 11. At Basidu, the evacuation was undertaken by one sloop and all gear worth removing was quickly got on board. The topmast of the flagstaff was set up temporarily as it had been decided to remove the flag with all ceremony, and for this purpose it was necessary to await the arrival of two of the sloops fronVBahrain. 12. After anchoring their tows, these ships arrived at Basidu on 11th April and the flag was hauled down for the last time at 1700, the guard consisting of a platoon from each of the three ships present. The ceremony, though short, was most impressive. 13* Arrangements had also been made to remove such of the inhabitants of the former British area who desired to leave before the Persian occupation (see February Intelligence l\ Report, paras. 4, 5, 6). In the end, 37 persons decided to I try their fortune at Bahrain, and no dhow being willing to ! take them, they were given passage together with their 1 belongings in sloops. 14. The cemeteries at both Basidu and Henjam will now be left under Persian protection and arrangements are being made for their periodical inspection. G. MOVa TO BAHRaM . 15* Prior to the evacuation, 3.N.C f 3 Staff Officer had been sent to Banrain in connection with the building plans etc. for the new base, and also to erect stone beacons in the new harbour at Khor Khaliya. The Shaikh of Bahrain was informed of the proposed move by the Political authorities on the day preceding the evacuation and, as expected, expressed his pleasure. As had already been arranged with his Advisor, the Shaikh then agreed to erect the necessary for the cost of 1 labour and materials only and this offer was gratefully accepted on 9th April. 16. The sloops with their tows arrived on the following day, and 'LUPIN'* remained at Bahrain to establish the necessary buoys and erect the flagstaff. This work was quickly^ CaPriBCi • • • • •(Sil) carried out and on 13th April r, SHOi^iHAM ,? led the whole Persian Gulf .Division into the harbour of Khor Khaliya for the first time. Platoons were landed in the afternoon and the white ensign was hoisted with due ceremony at 1400 the same day on the flagstaff which had formerly been at British Basidu. 17. Work on the buildings and pier commenced within a few days and it is probable that the new godown will be completed by the end of April. PERSIAN- RE-ACTIONS . 18. H.M.Minister, Tehran, reports that on notifying the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs of our decision to evacuate the latter assumed a pleased expression, and remarked that he regarded our decision as a step forward in improving Anglo-Iranian relations. 19. The only mention observed so far in the Persian press is as follows ’’The British authorities have commenced to evacuate the establishments that they had founded years ago at Basidu and Henjam; establishments which have provoked diplomatic discussions during the last two years.” (Le Messager) 20. In the middle of March, the Officer Commanding Troops, Bunaer iibbas visited Hen jam to select the site for a barracks. As our former buildings have been turned over to the Persians it is probable that they will utilise them, rather than embark on any new construction. 21. Cables and Wireless . Henjam W/T closed down in mid- ApriliThe Company intend re-organising their Gulf communications, but it is unlikely that they will transfer the Cable and/or W/T station from Henjam to Khor Kuwai. ^ mUQ UL CQA5T . 22. Tunb . In continuation of para. 15 of January Intelligence Rerort, H.M.Government decided in mid-March that they were not prepared to nay rent for the lighthouse and that the Shaikh of Ras-al-Knaimah should be given 10 days ■'auyu in which to replace his flagstaff and 'flag, otherwise the Shaikh of Sharjah would be authorised to take over the island instead. 23. as was exnected, this strong action nroved effective and the flagstaff was re-erected on 3rd April. 24. With reference to January Intelligence Report oara. 12 the roll of papers was delivered to the Headman of the Island in mid-April and consisted of Persian election notices. These were handed over to ’’LUPIN” without argument by the Headman. Persian persistence over Tunb is becoming^becoming Droverbial. ^ , » / (’’LUPIN” and telegrams from the Political Resident) 25. Internal Strife . In mid-March, ’’BIDEFORD” discovered that the three most influential inhabitants of the island - the Headman, the Lightkeeper and the water-carrier - were at loggerheads. The cause of the trouble was rather difficult to ascertain but the headman, apparently with the morals of the island at heart, objected to the lightkeepers visiting the water-carrier^ wife. They, in their turn, accused the head man of wishing to tax them and of threats to shoot them if they did not pay, while the water-carrier attributed the striie to the headman's jealousy of his steady income from the Government of India as a drawer of ^ater. After considerable talk the quarrel was patched up in ’’BIDEFORD”. 26. The Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah had also sent hia tax collector^—to the island at this time. They expected^some taxes Trom the pearl divers and the fishermen (Rupees Five per annumj and endeavoured to mulct the water-carrier of Rupees 60 ner annum income tax. After some bargaining the latter agreed to Rupees Ten but it remains to be seen whether the Shaikh will be satisfied with the small anount. (BIDEFORD). BU MUSa . 27. Visit of Persian Customs Launch . A launch containing the Director of (iustoms, from Bunder abbas visited the island early in March. In conversation with Mr. Barnett, of the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company, they posed as merchants and offered to take a letter which contained details of the last few months working and post it for him. 28. The letter was never delivered, and the next Persian move was a note to H.M.Minister protesting against the grant of the oxide concession# The Persian view was that this amountea to a misannropriation of the property of others, and that, failing satisfaction, ”the Persian Government will pursue the matter and take the necessary steps to protect their legitimate rights”. 29. In their reply, H#M.Government stated that they were unable to accent' the Persian protest and that - as the Persian Government were aware - H#M.Government have never admitted the Persian claim to the island# (’’BIDEFORD” and telegrams from the Hon. the Political Resident.) 30. Golden Valiev Ochre and Oxide_Cpmnany . The oxide is being minea from the side of the nighesfc hill on the island. Transport consists of two donkeys from the first half mile and thereafter by trolleys running on a well laid track to the S.E# corner of the island. More rails have been demanded to comolete the track. A dump of 250 tons had been collected by the end of April and the work so far has produced employment for 15 Bu Musians. (’’BIDEFORD”). 31. Reference February Intelligence Report para. 17 the agreement between the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Company for the exploitation of oxide was signed on 9th March. (Bahrain Int. Report.) ABU DHABIC0 ^7 rtBU DHABI . 32. Landing Ground , With reference to February Int. Report parasT 18-20, ’*BILEFORD ft took two R.A.F. officers to Abu Dhabi towards the end of March and, with the Shaikh’s approval a site for a landing ground was chosen about 1? miles from the town. It will probably be marked during May. 33. Artesian Water . In continuation of December Int. Report, para. 19, the A.P.O.C. geologist returned to Abu Dhabi in mid-March and as the result of further examination it is probable that water would not be found at shallow depths. Allah having blessed the country with plenty of rain recently the Shaikh was not greatly interested or concerned by this report. It is presumed that the geologist used his ten days’ stay and freedom of movement in quest of a more commercial fluid than water. ********* ** BAHRAIN * 35. Muharrum Calamity . A large number of poor women and children had collected at the house of a local merchant at the end of Muharrum to receive alms. A panic ensued, during which at least 83 persons lost their lives or died subsequently. 36. Political Agent . Colonel Loch proceeded on leave at the end of March on oeing relieved by Captain Cole, I.A. 37. Banra in-Saudi Customs . A Saudi delegation visited Bahrain during March to discuss the vexed question of transit dues on shipment destined for the mainland. After a fortnight’s discussions the following agreement was reached:- (a) that transit dues on goods landed and re- shipoed to the mainland would be reduced by one-eighth to 1 and seven-eights per cent. (b) That the concession of over-side delivery from steamers, free of dues, which had hitherto been limited to 1000 bags would be reduced to 100 bags. 38. These concessions are expected to result in a loss of two lakhs of Rupees to the Bahrain Customs, but presumably this is better than the chance of the Saudi Government opening the port of Ras Tanurah. 39. The head of the Saudi delegation had an embarrassing experience during his stay at Bahrain. It appears he was formerly a petty trader there, but fled to Hasa to avoid paying his debts of Rupees 900. His deliberations over Customs dues were rudely interrupted by his creditor threatening to bring him before the Agency.Court unless he paid up. A compromise was eventually arranged, the creditor receiving Rupees 300. (Bahrain Int. Report.) mm.* 40. Prehistoric village . As a result of the recent heavy rains, the remains or an alleged prehistoric village were found in the hills behind Kuwait town. Some 200 flint knives^ knives were found which have been sent to the British Museum for verification. 41. 3haikh of Kuwait’s Date Gardens . The controversy regarding the ownership of the Shaikh f s gardens on the 3hatt-al-Arab (on which he was promised by H.M.Govt. that no taxes would be levied in view of the assistance he rendered us during the late war) took a new turn recently. . 42. Shaikh's chief evidence regarding his right to own the property was lodged not long ago in the archives oi the Court at Basrah. It is now missing and has presumably been stolen. Enquiries are proceeding, and it is alleged that certain interested persons in the Iraq Government service are responsible for the theft. , ^ . (Kuwait Int. Report.) 43 . The Governor . Vice Consul, Mohammerah reports that the Governor has been suspended and ordered to proceed to Tehran. It is understood that this was on account of several complaints of bribery made against him by local merchants. 44. British Travellers. Two instances of the treatment accorded to prominent British travellers are reported from Mohammerah. In the first case, Mr. Moore, the editor of the ’'Statesman”, who was staying with the Vice Consul before proceeding to Tehran, received a visit from the Acting Governor. He had been instructed by Tehran to call, ana express the hope that Mr. Moore's reports on his^visits^to Persia would encourage other travellers from India to visit the country. 45. On the other hand. Sir Philip Game, G.B.E., K.C.B., D.S.O. the retiring Governor of New South Wales, who was passing through the f 'Fast ’ Gulf Mail, wished to visit Abadan. He had been unable to obtain a visa from the Persian Cpnsul at Karachi owing to the day being a holiday, and in spite.of the Vice Consul approaching the Acting Governor, permission could not be obtained to land at Mohammerah. 46 . Change of Name . In view of the recent Persian order, the iinglo-Persian Oil Company has been re-named the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, and the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation have also changed the word Persia to Iran. (Mohammerah Int. Report.) ********** * PERSIAN NAVY . t 52. Promotions . The following New Year promotions are reported by Vice-Consul Mohammerah:- Caotain Zelli, Commanding Officer ’'BABR'* to Yawar (Major). First Lieut. Naghdi ' ' 'PALANG'* to Captain. 2nd Lieut. Fuzuni to 1st Lieut. 2nd Lieut. Imahpur to 1st Lieut. ItIt will be noticed thatBayendor, who informed the Senior ^ Naval Officer he was expecting it, has not been promoted. 53. Training . Sultan (Captain) Tibatibai, a military officer attached to the Persian Navy, arrived at Mohammerah at the beginning of March to take over the training in drill of the naval conscripts. 54. Command . The Vice Consul also reports that there is a rumour in Mohammerah that the Navy will come under the command of the General Officer Commanding Khuzistan. 55. Anti-smuggling Measures . It is reported that 'CHAftBOKH' and t CHaHBAAZ ,t recently caught 5 dhows carrying some 600 packages of contraband goods on the Tangistan and Dashti Coasts. (Bushire Int. Report.) 56. Conscripts . The report contained in December Int. Report, para. 42, that in future conscripts from Coasta ports would be sent to the Navy, received some confirmation in March when 30 Bushire youths were sent to Mohammerah for naval training. (Bushire Int. Report.) ********* PKR2-IAN aRMY . 58. Rifles . The re-equipment of the army is proceeding and recently ten lorries containing arms and ammunition reached the Kermanshah garrison. The rifles are B.R.N.O. and are believed to have been manufactured in the Skoda works. (R.A.F. Int. Report.) PERSIAN aIR FORCE . 59. An attempt to hold an air review on the anniversary of the Coup d T Etat (B2nd February) proved to be a dismal failure. On 21st February four pilots reached Ahwaz with orders to fly the Furies to Tehran in time for the review next day. Time aid not permit of compasses being swung, no maps were available, and weather conditions were unfavourable. Three of the pilots arrived at Tehran on 27th after various adventures in the mountain snows where they had been forced down through lack of petrol. The fourth pilot arrived safely 10 days later/having missed Tehran by *200 Kilometres and being forced to walk for two days to the nearest telegraph office to enable him to order more petrol. 60. In spite of this debacle, a review of sorts was held, and consisted of three formations of three aircraft each, followed by a fourth containing five aircraft flying rather aimlessly over the aerodrome. A Hendon display was hardly to be expected, since on the day before the review, General Nakhichvan, commanding the air force, said that no programme had been arranged, but he thought they might do some aerobatics in formation. As this had never been practised before, he was a little doubtful whether it would be a success. His opinion was probably confirmed later the same day by his own experiences for, when landing, he crashed and turned his aircraft on its nose. 61. ... •61. The estimated strength on 1st March was:- At Tehran - 71 aircraft. At Ahwaz, awaiting construction - 17. Under construction in U.K. or en route to Persia - 58. The number of aircraft is considerably in excess of the number of mechanics and the latter are still without tools. (R.A.F. Int. Report.) *********** 64. New Pilgrim Route . A new route was opened in March between Najaf in Iraq and Medina, and has been blessed by both Governments, Pilgrims proceed by cars which proceed in convoys ana are escorted. (R.A.F. Int. Report.) 65. Saudi Air Force . It is reported from official sources that the Italian Government has agreed to undertake the flying training of a number of Saudi students. Only four of the fourteen students selected passed the medical examination. Their departure has aroused some enthusiasm and appeals have been made for the purchase and presentation of aircraft to the Saudi Government^by voluntary subscription. (R.A.F. Int. Report.) 3um± m m t h k g ulf. 66 . Japanese . The report that Japanese ships are to call at Gulf ports monthly is now confirmed by Mespers at Mohammerah. (Mohammerah Int. Report.) 67. S.D. 'ALASKA MAHU' of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha called at both Bushire and Mohammerah at the beginning of March. At both ports, the Captain gave a reception on board to the local*officials, who, afuer receiving quantities of beer and presentations of advertisements, were told that the ship was inaugurating a regular service between Japan and Persia* (Moharrmerah and Bushire I.R.). 68 . S.3. 'SAIKGH MARU' arrived at Mohammerah from Basrah at the end of February and embarked 1600 bales of cotton and £50 tons of tin scrap. (Mohammerah Int. Report.) 69. Swed ish. S.S. 'NIPON' arrived at Mohammerah at the end of February and discharged over 2500 packages of general cargo. She also brought out the new Bahrain Light Vessel. 70. Italian . S.S.

Iraa-Per^ia . as the commercial treaty between these countries expired in mid-February, maximum customs duty is now being charged on Iraqi goods entering Persia. (Mohamnerah Int. Report.) 72. Persian . a Government official is reported to have left Busnire by air for Shanghai, where it is understood that he will sell the Persian Governments stock of opium. It is also said that this official has authority to lease the oxideJ | ji, oxide mines in Quishm Island. (Bushire Int. Report.) OIL imBRBSTS . 73. Qatar . With reference to para. 74 of the last Intelligence Report, the A.P.O.C. were recently granted a further month r s extension to the beginning of May. 74. My staff officer met Mr. Mylles at Bahrain at the end of March and then stated that although the terms offered by the A*PoO.G. for the concession represented the maximum economic price, he did not think the Shaikh would grant the concession. The latter is reported to be the kind of man who holds on in the hopes of something better turning up. He did this in 1929 with his pearls, but when he at last decided to sell, prices had dropped due to the world depression and he lost heavily. : '$ JL 75. It is understood (from other sources) that the question of jurisdiction over the white emnloyees has also proved a stumbling block in the negotiations, as the Shaikh is reported to desire that all cases are tried in the Arab Court 76. The geologist-in-charge of the Standard Oil concession in Hasa, who was also met at Bahrain, had much to say about Qatar and it was evident that his comnany would like to make a bid for the concession. Mr. Miller inferred that Government measures to prevent foreign competition were most unfair. It is presumed he does not like our application of the Monroe doctrine in the Persian Gulf. 77. &amp;££&amp;. It was understood that vrork on the buildings at Damman is proceeding satisfactorily and that drilling will commence at the end of April. The pier referred to in nara. 81 of February Renort has a denth of 14 feet at its end, but this may be at high water. If production of oil really does occur it is probably that a pipe line would be laid to Has Tanurah. Mr. Miller has already inspected this harbour from the air. 78. bixoloration for oil continues in the interior but Mr. Miller agreed that any field found there would have to be very rich in oil to justify the necessary long pipe line to the coast. 79. Bahrain . The tanker 'HHEEM” arrived on 5th March and left the following day for Japan with a load of approximately 15,000 tons of crude oil. (Bahrain Int. Report.) 80. Kuwait . After showing the American geologists round the concession, the A.P.O.C. geologists left for Abadan at the end of March. No trial borings have yet been attempted. (Kuwait Int. Report.). FRENCH 5LP0F 'BOuAillWILLE 81. The following are extracts from the remarks of the Political Agent after the French sloop T s visit to Kuwait:- (a) All officers appeared very well informed on uulf questions. (b)I(b) The Shaikh of Kuwait was much impressed by the smart and new appearance of the shin and especially by the Diesels. He did not think the appearance of the crew could compare m any way with that of tne Royal Navy. (c) The French Admiral had wished to visit Sharjah but his superiors refused permission. (d) Admiral Revet also discussed at length the potential value of the harbour of Ras Tanurah. (e) He said that in the view of his Government the Saudi empire would break up on Bin Saud f s death and that there would again be chaos in Arabia. (f) Although he was at pains to explain that France had^ no real interest in the Gulf, he hopea that a French warship would pay another visit in two years’ time. (g) On the subject of the Cairo Broadcasting Station and Arab newspapers, he stated that France and Great Britain should keep a careful watch on v\hat was dissiminated, as Arab readers believed everything that appeared in print.

Stone beacons were constructed on Kassar Diwan rock and on the isolated shoal South-east of Jufair uhder supervision of the Staff Officer (Operations) during the first week in April. It is considered that similar beacons could be readily constructed in other suitable positions. 5* The southern house and its mejlis in the naval area was also prepared for R.I.N. ratings and Mr. Telles respectively. These buildings will be retained for use, and it is considered that the building of new R.I.N. lines will not therefore be necessary as the former are found to be in good condition. BAHRAIN . 6.

Many deaths occurred through the crowd endeavouring to force their way through a narrow passage, the door at the end of which was shut. The total number is doubtful but at least 83 were buried in Manamah cemetery. 11. A review, which had been arranged for the following day, was cancelled, a message of sympathy was sent to H.E. the Shaikh, and colours were half masted. His Excellency greatly appreciated the message of sympathy and the subscription made by Commander-in-Chief to the Relief Fund. TRUCIAL COAST . 14. Tunb. As already reported by signal, the Shaikh of Ras-al-Lhaimah gave orders for his flag to be replaced on the island, and this was done on 3rd April. 15. In response to a request from the lightkeeper LUPIN was sent to Tunb on 16th April and found that the headman of Khuni had brought over the documents referred to in Report of Proceedings for January 1936, paragraph 6.

He returned four days later and was then taken to Bushire in FOWEY on her way to Basrah. The Shaikh of Qatar, who was suffering from skin disease, was examined and treated by Surgeon Lieutenant Commander Brosnan, and greatly appreciated this attention. H.H. THE SULTAN OF MUSCAT . 17. His Highness, who paid a short visit to India in Mid-April, was embarked at Gwadur in LUPIN and taken to Sur. The Sultan spent about a week at this place before returning to Muscat in LUPIN. Fortunately the question of a salute did not arise at Gwadur. The walls of the godown were already three 10 Calamity at Bahrain . On 14th April a panic QATAR . 16 The Honourable the Political Resident wasEVACUATION OP HEN JAM 19. Political Agent, Muscat’s telegram announcing receipt of the Khor Kuwai concession in writing (28 Mch.) was the signal to the Minister at Tehran to set the machinery in motion, and an interview with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was arranged for a.m. Tuesday 2nd April. Confirmation that the interview had taken place did not reach me till 1800 on 2nd April, but a start was made in the morning to recover the oil barge moorings under the pretext of examination.... 20. Evacuation parties landed at dawn on 3rd April, to the astonishment of the Persians. There was no opposition and work progressed swiftly. Two oil barges were in turn put alongside the pier, which was very shaky and only just withstood the strain. General supervision of loading was ably carried out by Captain D.B. Fisher and officers of BIDEFORD. FOWEY was occupied with the moorings of No.2 barge, which proved refractory, and SHOREHAM provided the largest shore working parties. ♦ * * 22. The actual evacuation with the exception of the flag and flagstaff was completed during the forenoon of the 5th April. 23. At about 1600, accompanied by Lieutenant Bowman-Manifold and my Interpreter, I went ashore for a last inspection of the depot. It was wild and gusty, the air full of sand raised by the shemal and the scene inspired few regrets at our departure. Children were already playing in the deserted rooms of the R.I.N. lines, doubtless a prelude to the instalment of whole families. A heap of 20,000 beer bottles bought from the Canteen by a Contractor, stood as memorial to our occupation. 24. The Deputy Governor invited us to his house and I accepted. After the usual flatteries and a glass of sickly sherbet, which he personally served (a remarkable but belated Persian compliment), he took me across to the Quarantine Medical Officer to whom I wished to say good-bye. We were joined by the Mudir and Postmaster and sat for an hour while refreshments were prepared. It appeared that the three latter were genuinely distressed at our going. Finally, after submitting to a sedative of thick cocoa we were able to take our leave, and as I arrived on board the sun set and the flag was finally hauled down, immediately followed by the mast both of which were embarked. EVACUATION OF BASIDU . 25. On the morning of 6th April I proceeded to Basidu to complete the preliminary arrangements made by LUPIN On 8th April I heard that Persian officials were intimidating the inhabitants of British Basidu and on going ashore, I found the local Persian headman and the Farash of Customs in our territory. The former admitted to forbidding any departure from British Basidu, but the latter said he received his instructions from the Mudir of Persian Basidu. Both were promptly turned out.n* C&amp;S) 26. When sent for, the Mudir of Persian Basidu excused himself from attending giving as his reasons that he was in bed suffering from fever, but sent a message to say that he was not responsible for the headman and that the farash had received no such instructions from him. He added that he would be prepared to consider passes for the inhabitants if they and their gear were sent to the Custom House in Persian Basidu. This the frightened inhabitants would not do, neither could it be compiled with for other obvious reasons. * * * 28. The original plan to evacuate by dhow proved unworkable. To have chartered an Arab dhow before the general announcement would have been likely to make clear our intentions. The shemal prevented the chartering at the last moment of any Arab dhow and no Persian dhow would take the risk of sailing without a clearance, which would not have been granted. 29. The matter was referred to Tehran, the Minister giving his assent, in the circumstances, to evacuating by sloop. 30. On the morning of 11th April, BIDEFORD and FOWEY arrived from Bahrain. Platoons were landed to practice ceremonial drill and the property of the inhabitants was embarked, BIDEFORD taking the greater part while FOWEY wrestled with the portable but none the less athletic livestock. 31. At the last moment the Inspector of Customs from Bunder Abbas who had just arrived at British Basidu, sent a letter in the same sense as the message from the Mudir. I sent for him and explained that while the British flag was flying he had no jurisdiction and that we were removing the non-Persian inhabitants who naturally did not wish to remain after we left. He apologised and withdrew the letter and said he had no objection to a Persian dhow coming to take off those people. He became quite friendly and promised to assist any of the remaining inhabitants who might wish to leave later and that the cemetery would not be interfered with till arrangements had been made for its care. 32. Platoons were landed p.m. and were drawn up facing the guardhouse. The male inhabitants had been ordered to attend and there was already an infiltration of Persians. At 1700 the flag was lowered with honours, the guard acquitting themselves very creditably. The flag was ■fiurought on board with all due reverence, the topmast followed at a short distance. The male refugees were taken off to SHOREHAM with the returning platoons (the women and children being already installed) and at 1900 ships sailed in company. 33. It was gratifying to note that the refugees, (who were behind screens on the quarterdeck and unaware they could betoeen) stood to attention as the bugles sounded and the Ensigns of the Division were lowered at Sunset, as they had learned to do in the vicinity of the flagstaff at Basidu. KH0R51 KHOR KHA.LIYA. BAHRAIN 36, Preparations had been made for putting up the Basidu lowermast, and the topmast, carried in SHOREHAM was landed in anticipation of the ceremony to be carried out the following day. The refugees were landed and temporarily accommodated at Jufair pending the arrival of their furniture, reed huts and live stock carried in BIDEFORD and FOWEY. * * * 38. The Division made its formal entry into Khor Khaliya in close order, anchoring off Jufair, inperfect station. 39. The same platoons as at Basidu were landed at the R.A.F. pier a few minutes after anchoring. The white ensign with the Commanding Officers was taken ashore in Senior Naval Officer’s barge. The Company with fixed bayonets commenced its 40 minute march to Jufair. In the early afternoon of the 13th the white ensign was hoisted with full honours at the 75 foot mast which had for many years carried our national emblem at Basidu 40. Political Agent, Advisor, Inspector of Customs and the majority of the other British inhabitants were present, but the Shaikh was unable to attend on account of the religious festival - Muharram. * * * 43. On 18th April I gave a farewell dinner party to the British Residents of Bahrain, to which I also invited Mr. Davies, the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. He has been very friendly in the past and has entertained officers and men of more than one ship of the division on their visits to the oil fields, while his recent gift of 900 sacks to my staff officer helped materially with the evacuation of coal from Henjai^. 44. I had several conversations with both the Honourable the Political Resident and Political Agent on the question of Bahrain Cis toms Regulations, and I understand that a settlement satisfactory to the Royal Navy will shortly be reached. Both were most helpful. 45. H.E. Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa, K.C*I.E. expressed a wish to pay a farewell call on me, and on 20th April he came on board in the afternoon. I was very touched at his evidence of friendship. He was saluted on his departure. I returned this call on 22nd April and witnessed a display of horsemanship and Arab dancing which was being held as part of the celebrations in honour of H.W, the Ruler’s son’s forthcoming marriage. At this display, I also met Shaikh Juma, the brother of the Shaikh of Debai who had made himself a leading figure in the celebrations and who greeted me with considerable warmth. * ♦ * BAHRAIN TO SUR . 48 Several Shaikhs, hearing I would call at Sharjah, assembled there to bid me farewell. I was sorry that weather did not permit them coming off. I received a signal of farewell from them and the Residency Agent, who put off to see me, but his boat capsized and he had an unpleasant swim ashore. * * *51. SHOREHA.M arrived at Sur on 27th April and I landed at once to say good-bye to the Sultan. His Highness, who had said he was anxious to see me, was, I think, gratified at this attention and was most cordial. I was escorted to and from the beach by over 300 armed men who wasted much ammunition, in addition to a somewhat ragged crowd, 52. During this visit, His Highness’ first secretary, with great agility for an Arab, had taken cinema photographs of the procession from various vantage points, at the Sultan’s orders. I missed the face of a ferocious looking and picturesque old Nakhoda who, I believe, had formerly dabbled in piracy. On enquiry I learned he had been murdered at night a few months ago. 53 53. Desultory skirmishing with the Bedouins of the interior is still taking place in the district - three or four casualties a week - but no serioiis fighting is apparently expected. * * * (Sd.) J.V.

His Imperial Majesty the shah’s birthday was celebrated on 15th March, ships in harbour being dressed overall and a Royal salute of 21 guns fired at noon. Owing to the discourtesy of the Deputy Governor in not receiving an officer sent to inform him of our intention of firing a salute, the population were not aware of the of the anniversary until the morning of the 15th March when the only flag that could be found was hurriedly hoisted and messengers sent to find if any red white and green material was available in the local shops ~ without avail. 6. The Deputy Governor die his best to atone for this breach of good manners by asking Senior Naval Officer, Commanding Officers and officers of ships in harbour to a tea party on the occasion of Persian New Year. The Quarantine Medical Officer acted as Master of Ceremonies and his exceptionally liberal ne asure of whiskey did much to make the party a success. This is the first occasion in at least five years that British officers have been invited to an entertainment by the Persian officials. I discovered that it was instigated by the Quarantine Medical Officer.BA3IIHJ» 7. Towards the end of the monthi the two buoys and sinkers were lifted for examination and repainting.

Leaving Henjam on 17th March, 3H0RKHAM arrived at Muscat next day and arrangements were at once put in hand for receiving on board not only H.H.the Sultan, but also a number of uncles and a large bodyguard to say nothing of the victuals required for the journey. The olitical Agent's knowledge of Arab requirements much assisted our preparations. Tie bodyguard arrived amid great clamour and with the most assorted luggage, arms and accoutrements on the evening of 20th March and after embarking His Highness and the political Agent, 3H0RBHAM left for Khassab via Khor Kuwai. 18. HQR KUWAI AND KHaSSAB« Tie following morning the ship steamed through KHor ’vUwai and His Highness, having studied the island and adjoining mainland through binoculars, said he did not wish to land. SH0RKHA&amp; then proceeded to Khassab and after disembarking His Highness and suite, reached Henjam on the evening of 21st March. 19. H iNJAM• Accompanied by the Commanding Officer, LUPIN and Officers from both ships, I attended the Deputy Governor's reception the following afternoon. He obviously wanted to be friendly and it was noticeable that tea, drinks and a gramaphone concert appeared at exactly the same time as had been the case when I entertained him on board SHORjUAM some months ago. 20. -HOP 'U7AI» .

Otherwise there have been no develop ments of importance# and the presence of a sloop has possibly dissuaded the Persians from any Ideas they may have had of claiming the island. As yet there is no sign of the flagstaff being returned. All dhows arriving at the island are searched. 7. It was learned from iiahmood that Isa - the Residency Agent - had proceeded from the Yrucial Coast to Bahrain and that the Bhaikh of Ras al Khaimah expects him to return with authority for payment of rent for the lighthouse# after which he will# according to Mahmood# restore the flagstaff. 8 . During a shamal on 9th February a Persian dhow containing refugees from conscription and which was anchored off the island, was driven ashore and became a total loss. There were no casualties# but as food was scarce on the island# BIDEFGRD supplied some provisions and assisted to speed these embarrassing and unwelcome guests.

He however called on me on the 18th January and was received with a guard and saluted with eleven guns on leaving. A good deal of exchange of calls took place between various members of the government and myself. 12. The officers and men were well entertained during the stay, specially the latter, for whom several dances and trips to places of interest were arranged. This was mainly due to the efforts of the Mayo Marine Institute, who had collected funds for the purpose. I subsequently put a notice of thanks in the Rangoon Gazette. 13. I took the opportunity of the length of stay at Rangoon to visit Mandalay with some of my officers. Accommodation was provided there at the Upper Burma Club, and excellent snipe and jungle fowl shooting obtained.

I then returned the Political Agent’s call and he conducted me to the Palace to call on the Sultan's Representative, Said Sha'ah. who is acting as such during the Sultan's absence in India. I was cordially received by Said Sha'ab and after about fifteen minutes talk on general subjects (interpreted by the Political Agent) I returned to the ship. During my visit I handed Said Sha'ab a personal letter which the Sultan (when I met him privately in Bombay) had entrusted to me for delivery. 6. Shortly afterwards the Sultan's Representative accompanied by the Sultan's Secretary came off and returned my call, and was saluted as he left the ship. 7.

The Shaikh of A1 Ajman had little of interest to discuss hut drew the attention of the Political Agent to a matter connected with pearl diving. It appears that Ajman hired some pearl divers and consequently advanced them funds, tfie pearl divers then left Ajman and are now at A1 Hairah, i.e. under Sharjah. The Shaikh had already written to the Shaikh £ Sharjah suggesting that either the pearl divers should return to Ajman or else the advance should he paid hack. The Political Agent said that he would discuss this quarrel with the Shaikh of Sharjah and it is understood that this matter has been referred to Isa - the Residency Agent. Alii Phall** * 10, Prior to this visit the Shaikh of Ahu Dhahi had asked Colonel Loch if anyone could find artesian wells at Ahu Dhahi; resulting from this request the Political Agent arranged for Mr. Cox to accompany him on a visit of research. It was fully realised hy the Political authorities that a valuable opportunity had arisen whereby an Anglo-Persian Oil Company representative could obtain an entree into Ahu Dhahi on the pretext of finding water and also visit the other islands belonging to the shaikh for a similar purpose. Although this may savour of intrigue and deception, it must in all fairness he pointed out that geological investigations made in the Persian Gulf for the purpose of finding both oil and water are of an identical nature; furthermore there is little doubt that if water does materialise in or near Ahu Dhahi some considerable endeavour to obtain it for the shaikh will subsequently he made, partly to improve the amenities of his shaikhdom and at the same time to augment his goodwill towards ourselves. 11. LUPIN arrived off Ahu Dhahi early on 3rd December and it was tacitly agreed that the subject of oil should not he mentioned while the ship was there. No doubt, however, seems to have existed in the mind of the shaikh that a search for oil was Mr. Cox T s objective, for when he met the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. BIDEFORD a few days later his enquiries were solely about oil, water not being mentioned ...,12. The shaikh, who was in a happy mood, called on the Political Agent and had a long talk in regard to the possihilities of Mr. Cox's visit. He brought off a few crystals, samples of red oxide and gypsum for Mr. cox's ^ inspection. The shaikh was saluted with 5 guns on leaving. 13. The Political Agent was saluted with 11 guns when he left LUPIN to return the shaikh’s call. In the afternoon a motor dhow took the shaikh, the Political Agent and Mr. Cox to survey a small hill about 8 miles north east of Abu Dhabi. The dhow grounded Just before sunset so the party spent the night there; it is probable that this had been anticipated by the shaikh as the dhow was well provisioned. Next day the party visited another hill t5 the westwara of Abu Dhabi.' ^ 14. Mr. Cox was unable to forecast the possibility of water being obtainable at Abu Dhabi after so scanty a survey* he seemed to doubt the presence of artesian water below this place but thought there was a faint possibility of fresh water existing at some depth, to obtain which a pump would be required. 15. The shaikh informed the Political Agent, when they were together in the dhow waiting for the tide to flood, that Bin Saud had through the Manassir tribe been extracting certain taxes from the country inland of Abu Dhabi. There is no doubt the King of Arabia is greatly feared by the Trucial Shaikhs. 16. Dr. Holmes spent both days ashore administering to the local needs, he had a vast number of people all trying to obtain treatment; his work was most beneficial in creating friendly impression at Abu Dhabi. 17. On 5th December, the Political Agent and Mr. Cox landed to say good-bye to the shaikh and also to give a brief summary of the geological examination.

'While at Abu Dhabi it was learned that the eldest Buttee son (Said bin Buttee of Debai) had just married an Abu Dhabi girl of the Al-Bu-Fallah tribe; she is closely related to the shaikh of Abu Dhabi.

LUPIN left Dalmah at daylight on 9th December and after passing ARZANA and DAIYINA, anchored off Halul during the same afternoon, thus leaving the great pearl bank. 23. The island was inspected by Mr. Cox and Colonel Loch, who had heard that deposits of guano and red oxide were to be found on the island. It anpears that the guano is Scanty and the oxide is coarse. 24. In the evening Mr. Cox very kindly gave a short lecture to the officers and ship f s company in which he explained briefly the structure in which oil fields may be found and in particular he described the geological interpretation of the Bahrain and Persian oil fields. survey tne coun'ory, tnis would probably take about six months. 27.

The information contained in Express Letters No f s C./285 and C.286 from Political Agent, Muscat, was not available until Wednesday, 12th December. 6. In view of the fact that the Badans concerned were not returning immediately from Nakran to the Batineh and that, in the Political Agent f s opinion, the traffic, in addition to being desultory, was likely to cease almost entirely during 1 Hamadan f , I decided to remain at Muscat until arrival of T Down T Mail Steamer on Friday, 14th December. 9. I had no means of ascertaining that Shinas was populated chiefly by Baluchis, but it is certainly suspicious that I should be told that Baluchi dhows have not recently called there, when this must obviously be an untruth. 10. On 10th December, I called at Dibah to embark three male slaves who, 1 was informed by the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. BlDEFOiiD, naa escape a from Debai and were desirous of being taken to Muscat for manumission. 11. The Sheikh f s representative called on me on mv arrival and brought off two of the # slayes. # He said lie had warned the third slave to remain in “Dhe vicinity of Dibah, in order to be immediately available in the event of a sloop arriving, but the man had apparently gone to a neighbouring village. 1 waited for two hours, but the slave did not appear. The remaining two were hanaed over to the Political'Agent at Muscat on 11th December. 12. With regard to Habalain. on a previous visit of FOWEY, the natives werofrresented with food and old clothes. I consider this practice should be deprecated, as it undoubtedly led to continued and vociferous demands for a repetition of these gifts. The consequent uproar alongside the ship throughout the stay marred the pleasure of our visit. 13. The Sheikh did not trouble to come off for three days, and, when he did, it transpired that he had not done so from motives of courtesy, but to beg for food and/or presents. The natives appeared well nurtured and as well clothed as most, and'the poverty, if it exists, is possibly due to an inherent indolence, for, as aloeady reported, they preferred begging to fishing.

The caretaker came on hoard in his own boat on our arrival and made the following report (a) No incidents have occurred since the last Sloop T s visit. (b) No Persian sloops have visited the place. (c) On 3rd December three Persian census offi cers arrived at Persian Basidu and warned 3 of the inhabitants that in 10 days time they 'would be called up for conscription. The census officers left the island later, and did not enter British territory. (d) The Mudir has been quite polite and on one or two occasions has asked the caretaker f s permission to wal^: in British territory. (e) There are three inhabitants of British Basidu who have Persian passports issued last year; all of these are due for conscription, and one of them, in antici pation of being called up, has departed to the Trucial Coast. 6. The caretaker stated that he was due to receive his pay. No orders regarding this can be found in BIDEFORD; former Cash Accounts show nothing. But it is understood that it has been customary for visiting sloops to pay this man, and he was given Rupees, 11.4 representing one month f s pay. He was given bread, and was permitted to make small purchases at the Canteen and from the Paymasters Stores. 7. On the afternoon of 4th December, I landed with the Interpreter to see over the territory. While aahore an owner of land in British Basidu, Abdulla Mohammed Musa (who has,a son serving as an Officers servant in h w q BIDEFORD).reported to me that Sheikh Solih, the Persian Tax collected of Qishm Island, had recently demanded the payment of 4 Rials being a year's tax on Musa's date palms. uclX6S. /i LI told the man that if the Persian Tax collector made another demand, he was to he told again that owners of lard on that (the British) side of the 'boundary va?e not subject to Persian taxes, and that if necessary tne tax collector should apply to Teheran. Musa f s estate is just inside the boundary, the latter being well defined at that point. * * THURSDAY. 6th DECEiv'IBER. 10. We arrived Dibah at 0830 and the Sheikh being away at Kalba, his representative came on board. He had nothing whatever to report, so after the usual ceremony he was shown round the ship. His call was returned immediately afterv/ards. 11. As the Shaikh 1 s representative was about to depart, a large negro (who : foimed one of the Sheikhas boat T s crew) came inboard and spoke to the Sheikh^ representative. After a whispered consultation the lat ter came forward and told me the man was a slave who had escaped from Debai and wanted to be repatriated at Muscat. I investigated the matter and as the case appeared genuine I told the slave he could come on board. ~ (I intended to transfer him to FOWEY). But the man said there were two others who had also escaped with him,that he did not want to come without them, and that they were waiting on the beach. He was told to bring them off as soon as possible as the ship was about to sail, and landed with the Sheikh T s representative. Meanwhile the return call was paid ashore and as, two hours later, there was no sign of anyone coming off, i left without them. On meeting FOWEY the next day I told the Captain aboit these slaves and requested him to consider their embarka tion if he went to Dibah. * * MONDAY. 10th DECELBEi,. 19. We arrived at Atu DhaDi at 0930. The inter preter lanaed and accompanied the Sheihhoff to call on me. The.Sheikh was extremely friendly. Vie discussed the recent visit to Ahu Dhabi of LUPIN with the Political Agent, Bahrein. I was under the impression that the Sheikh had been led to believe that the recent visit was in connection with (amonst other matters) the discovery of water. However the Sheikh infomed me that the geologist had been seeking oil, and he also asked me if I knew whether any had been found in Yas and laimah Islands after they left Abu Dhabi. I replied truthfully that I didn’t know. The Sheikh was saluted on leaving, and I returned his call at 1700 by arrangement.fy? $3 TIIESMy, 11th DSGSIvEEK. ^ Detaj was reached at 1430 and the Sheikh came off with my interpreter who had gone in to meet him.

I then landed at noon to return the Sheikh's call, and after this 1 went to see the Residency Agent. He was obviously very ill after an attack of malaria though not in bed. There were no facilities that I could give him, and he said that he was slowly getting better. _ On the way back to the boat I called at the imperial Airways Rest House and was shown over it by the Manager. HEiiJAk. TUESDAY. 18th DECEMBER. ^ ^ S8 n* interpreter reported to me that the exodus of the local population to the mainland to avoid conscrip tion continues, and there are now a great many emptv houses on the Island. ^ H ,y 39. also informed me that the H^fljam 1 'RaSS6'? iarl messa ges have been despatched from (Sd.)

So that the Persian Gulf Fund should benefit, arrangements were made to sell these at Bombay, the proposal being to avoid freight charges by sending them in the oil barge proceeding to refit. * . _ 2. The local Mudir, however, would not allow the bottles to be moved without authority from Bunder Abbas. Shortly after this ban, a contractor arrived from Bunder Abbas and offered to buy the lot. As bottles are scarce in Persia, it seems possible that the Contractor was sent at the instance of the Director of Customs. The sale was completed on reasonable terns. The Contractor states he was disposing of some to- the Persian Government. .3. floorings. It has been decided that the three moorings, in the form of old muzzle-loading guns may now be presented to the Persian Government by H.M. Minister. Instructions have therefore been given that they are on no account to be moved. BASIPU. 4. Future of inhabitants. Should the decision be reached to -hand over the present British area at Basidu to Persians, it was felt that some of the inhabitants might suffer owing to the assistance they had rendered us during our occupation. 5. As a precaution, a list of such people has recently been compiled, and should they desire to leave before the Persian occupation, they will be assisted to do so from a special fund of £400 which the Honourable the Political Resident hopes to obtain from the Treasury shortly. 6. It is recognised that we have a moral obligation to these people, and the fact that most of them have been compelled to take out 'sijills' (Persian registration books) in order to pursue their normal trading with Persian ports, will not debar them from receiving assistance from the Fund. 7. C ustoms Post. A Customs post has recently been erected on the Persian side of the boundary between British and Persian Basidu. This, among numberous other indications, would seem to imply that the Persians do not consider they have a very good case for the renewal of their claim that the area is Persian territory.r/2) TRUGIAL COASI . 9. Tunt. Little has occurred at Tunt during the month under report. Mahmood, the headman, returned fjom his visit to Bas al Khaimah in the middle of the month, and, in accordance with recent practice, the dhow in which he travelled was searched, but nothing was found. 10. Mahmood asked to see BlDEPOKD’s doctor, and during the course of an extensive medical examination his clothes were seacched and an apen envelope contain ing a letter in two parts was found (A) Addressed to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah telling him of the roll of papers referred to in para.12 of January Intelligence Report and that the '•British Government' knew of the existence of these papers. (B) Addressed to Mahmood telling him not to return to Tunb until the Shaikh gave him permission, as the Persians wanted the island and were going to send a Mudir there in February. The writer was Mahmood’s brother, Ahmed bin Mohammed and the letters were dated 26th January. 11. The roll of papers did not reach the island during the month and as the Persians must have known that we were searching dhows and keeping a close watch on Tunb, it was decided at the end or the month to revert to frequent visits instead of the continuous presence of a sloop. 12 1 The following note on the ownershi eceived from the Honourable th terest. ™*~*™~*, of Tunb e Political Resident is of n Tunb belongs to Jowasimi Tribe, of which the Chief Shaikhs are Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah and is locally regarded as connected with the latter. Up to 1921 we treated Ras al Khaimah as part of Sharjah, and accordingly in 1912 it was from latter that concur rence in erection of lighthouse on Tunb was obtained. In 1921 Government of India recognised Ras Al Khaimah as separate Shaikhdom. If Ras al Khaimah secedes then presumably the other Jowasimi Shaikh i.e. Sharjah can resume possession of the Island'. 13. Ras al Khaimah . During the visit of the French sloop BOUGAI1WILLE to the Gulf, a visit was made to Ras al Knaimah. The Shaikh did not go on board, but met the French Admiral on the beach. The following conversation ensued:- Shaikh. Are you British or French ? Admiral. I am French. Shaikh. Are you at war with the British ? (hopefully) Admiral. No, we are friends. Shaikh. Have you any arms; will you give me some? / Admiral.Admiral. I have arms for my ship, but none to give away. Shaikh. Well, will you sell me some ? The Admiral led the Political Agent, Bahrain - to whom he recounted the above story - to infer that he haa not complied with the Shaikh's request. 14. A messenger from the Residency Agency also confirms the above story and further states that the French officers were well received. „ . (Bahrain Intelligence Repoit 15. From different sources it is rumoured that . the Shaikh has given the French sloop a letter which is supposed to contain a request that they should arrange for a geologist to see if fresh v/ater can be found at Ras al Khaimah. The French Admiral promised to niake enquiries whether a suitable person was available. This fits in with a wish expressed by the Shaikh in November 1934 that his territory should be examined for evidence of water and oil. 16. Bu Musa Mr. Barnett of the Golden Velley Ochre and Oxide Company, arrived at Bu Musa early in February bringing with him some machinery. He hopes to commence operations at once. 17. The Company are concluding an agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah for mining rights on Bu Musa and Sir Bu Nai’ir islands. The Shaikh has accepted their proposals subject to the inclusion of certain additional clauses, which have now been referred back to the Company. (Bahrain Intelligence Report.) 18. Abu Dhabi and Yas Island. A satisfact- ory settlement of the air facilities question has now heen reached. It may he summarised as follows a, h &gt; c, (d) (e) A landing ground and petrol store on Yas Island. A landing ground and petrol store near Abu Dhabi. Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to pay for sufficient guards for (a) and (b). H.M.Government to pay the Shaikh Rupees 400 a month, besides a lump sum of Rupees 5000 as a token of friendship and good-will. Agreement will be for period of 12 years. 19. The agreement is most satisfactory particu larly in view of the key position held by the Shaikhdom of Abu Dhabi in the Trucial Coast hinterland. Moreover the Shaikh, thanks largely to our efforts to find him artesian water and the ministrations of Dr. Holmes of Bahrain, is on more friendly terms with the Political authorities than he has been for some years past. (Correspondence from Hon. the P.R.) 20. It is anticipated that the landing grounds will be marked shortly and a combined operation such as at Sukra Bay recently (though with fewer difficulties) is likely. 21. Debai . During the Commander-in-Chief's /visit|- visit to the Trucial Coast, the Shaikh of Debai asked that, in the event of further trouble with his cousins, that a British Political Officer might attend a majlis at Debai. Should he then decide that the cousins were to blame, the Shaikh asked that approval should be given for the offenders to be exiled. 22. The Commander-in-Chief forwarded this request to the Honourable the Political Resident, in the latter’s view, as the Shaikh is recognised by His Majesty’s Government, the cousins in trying to rebel against him, put themselves in the wrong. The Honourable the Political Resident thinks that if the above request was granted, we should become involved in the internal affairs of Lebai, which would be, in his opinion, most undesirable. 23. In making the request, it seems that the Shaikh was preparing for further trouble which he appears to think may break out again in the future. * * BAHRAI N , . ^ 25. Hospital Amiexe . Thanks to the generosity of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, a bungalow has been built recently and given to the Arabian Mission (American) for patients from the British and American communities of Bahrain. 26. rv r’s Accession . H.E.Shaikh K.C.I.E., C.S.I., celebrated Sir Hamad Bin Isa A 1 the second anniversary of his'accession’between’l9th-21st January. These dated coincided with the Commander-in- Chief’s visit to Bahrain. _ ,, 27. Experiments in Cultivation. During 1934 an Indian merchant put a small plot of land under tobacco. The results were so successful that a larger area is being tried this year. 28. The Shaikh has also experimented in growing oranges with great success. Now that the pead season is so poor each year, it is encouragirigto see endeavour being made to find other sources of revenue. 29. Visit of French sloop. BOUGAINVILLE visited Bahrain between 14th and 16th February. The usual calls were exchanged and a party of officers were taken out to visit the oil fields. 30. The French sailors are reported to have much diverted the populace by their demands for 'Drrink l Women !' They were told that the former was prohibited. 31. Sunni- Shi’ah Agitation . The old-standing ill-feeling between these two sections became acute early in February, but the agitators have been warned by both the Shaikh and Political Agent that they will be held responsible for any breach of peace and the trouble has subsided./ 46 szb 32. Political Agency . The Assistant Political Agent, Mr. MJ/orth,I.G.3., left for the United Kingdom on leave on 21st February. Mr.Worth has proved himself very capable and a live wire during his snort stay in the Gulf and was popular with the British, Arab and American communities. * * 34. The Commander-in-Chief visited Kuwait between 15th and 16th January and was invited by the Shaikh to dinner and also to a hawking party in the interior. 35. Rain. Owing to the continuance of the rains, the grazing in Kuwait has seldom been better, and a number of migratory tribes from Iraq have now reached Kuwait territory. This migration, however, is not unusual. 36. The Ha.i . Arrangements have been concluded between the Shaikh and Bin Saud whereby all genuine Kuwaiti pilgrims will be issued with passes allowing them free passage through the latter f s dominions.Persians, Iraqis, and other foreign nationals will be taxed as forma* ly. The main body of pilgrims set out on their 1200 mile journey at the beginning of February. 37. H.M-Minister, Tehran , during his visit to Kuwait made a substantial donation to the fund for 'cloud burst' sufferers. The Shaikh later, at a public durbar, told his people of this, and urged that Mussulmans might with advantage take a leaf out of the Christians’ book. * * 43. Baluchi Unrest. As already reported, there has recently been much unrest in Persian Baluchistan, which has manifested itself in brigandage, looting and raids on Persian military and Amnieh posts. The Persians seem to he quite powerless to supress the tribesmen concerned and have insinuated that much of the trouble is caused by British intrigue. They also accuse the authorities in British Baluchistan of harbouring Persian refugees, whereas the facts show that, whenever discovered such people are disarmed on crossing the frontier. 44. As they are lacking in transport, the Persian military authorities have recently commandeered Indian lorries returning towards the frontier, to convey troops and stores. Owing to the inadequate guards provided for these convoys, it is reported that they are constantly being attacked and that two Indiandrivers have been killed and four wounded. 45. Arrangements have been made that the British Military Attache should enquire on the spot into the allegations contained in para.43 above. (R.A.P.Intelligence Report)46. During the month under report, the Tehran papers published an indignant denial of Reuter T s report that a Persian patrol had entered British Baluchistan and killed an Indian guard. The story as quoted in 'L’lran' is that the Persian patrol was attacked in Persian territory and, in defending itself, killed the guard. The one thing common to both reports was the death of the Indian guard. (Le Messager). 47* Afghanistan . Frontier Mid . The Commission of Enquiry into theldurabad raid (see December &amp; January Intelligence Reports) has completed its investigations, and the following is a summary of a communique published in the Tehran papers hy authority of the Minister of Foreign Affairs (a) The raid occurred without the knowledge or desire of the Afghan Government. (b) It has been proved that the incident was provoked by chiefs of the Afghan border tribes. (c) The Afghan Government has agreed to pursue and punish the border tribes, particularly the murderers of the Persian soldiers, and to pay damages to the Persian victims of the raid. (Le Messager.) * * 49. IflleEna^. Anniversary of coup 4»Etat. In celebration of this anniversary, a review of the troops of the Tehran garrison by the Shah has been arranged for 22nd February, followed by a dinner at the Ministry of War to which members of tne Government have been invited. 50. The occasion is also to be marked by the issue of special sets of stamps commemorating the progress made under the present regime in Art. Science. Justice, Aviation, Navy, Industry, Communications, Hygiene, etc. (Le Messager.) 51. lour of. Mi n iste r o^. Fi papc e. This official visited most Gulf Districts during January and February and appears to have made some effort to alleviate the distress of the inhabitants. He has reduced the tax on tea and sugar, commenced irrigation schemes, and arranged that cultivators should be able to borrow money and seed for agricultural purposes. Nevertheless, the economic condition M the country is reported to be extremely bad. The Inspection Offices, established to supervise the Customs, are reported to have been abolished recently, and in consequence there has been an increase in the amount of smuggled goods reaching the interior. (Bushire Intelligence Report.) 52. Persian Navy . New C struction , ree Officers, • •••••• four non-commissioned officers and twenty-seven ratings left for Italy at the end of January. Through disregard ing a warning prior to departure that they would not be allowed to proceed through Iraq in uniform, they were held up at the frontier, until ordered by Tehran to change into plain clothes.53* Salute to 'Sarhang' . In the January Intelligence Report it was reported that Bayendor expected to he pri&amp;moted to Sarhang in March. This would entitle him to a salute of 11 guns under Persian Regulat ions, hut as a Note has recently been despatched to the Persian Government pointing out that hy international practice, a commodore receives 11 guns and that his equivalent rank is brigadier-general, it will he interest ing to see the Persian reactions. 54. Persian Army . Five military secondary schools have recently been opened in Tabriz, Meshed, Isfahan, Shiraz and Kermanshan. In addition, boys at school are being-taught drill, which may be the beginning of a form of Officer Training Corps. (R.A.F. Intelligence Report &amp; Le Messager). 55. ffersian Air Force . Eight Hawker Furies and ten De Havilland Tiger Moths which arrived recently at Ahwaz are being erected there for flying to Tehran. Four of the Furies were completed during the month, but one is reported to have crashed, the pilot being killed. (R.A.F. Intelligence Report.) 56. Communications . W/T. The Postmaster of Lingeh, who took passage in BARPETA. stated that he was proceeding to Tehran in connection with the re-estab- lishment of the W/T station at Lingeh. He considered the station would be operating in a few months. (Master S.S. ,r Barpeta M ) 57. Air Race Repercussions . Apparently the American airmen, Wright and Pollando', who, as already reported, were so delayed at Mohammerah as to spoil their chances in the England-Australia Race, have complained bitterly to the American papers. In consequence, 'L’lran' publishes a denial of the bad treatment alleged, and retaliates by congratulating the Mohammerah police on doing their duty so impartially. (Le Messager.) . 58. toliaj iperah . The ex-Mudir of Customs, Heniam, arrived at Mohammerah during the month. In conversation with the Consulate Interpreter, he said that he had been suspended for the last four months on account of his friendship with, and the assistance he had given to. the Royal Navy. - 9 (Mohamerah Intelligence Report). 59. It may be that this story is true, as, he was a reasonable official to deal with, but it is also possible that he was suspended for bribery. S&amp;IPI. A^PIA- 60. Bin Saud. His Majesty is still in camp, much to the disgust of his eldest son Faisal, who is reported to have urged his father to return to the capital and give more time to affairs of State. Faisal also argued / thatthat the King T s presence near Kuwait will he misunderstood hy both Kuwaitis and the British. It is thought that Bin Baud’s choice of the Summan area for his hawking, is not unconnected with the establishment of Customs posts on the line of wells facing Kuwait. 61. From several Arab sources, it is reported that the King has lately been receiving numbers of important visitors, not only from Arabia, but from as far afield as Damascus and Baghdad. It would seem (reports an eye witness) that never has Bin Baud been so much sought after, and all v/ho are dissatisfied in their own country appear to 'gravitate towards Riyath'. Among others, the son of the Shaikh of Qatar visited the King on his way across Arabia to attend the Haj. 62. Most of these guests are entertained lavishly and proceed from the camp to the Master of the Household at Tiyath v/here they are given presents of money. Such munificence causes much comment in Kuwait, for although the King receives money from the Standard Oil Company it is thought that v/ith 'Such large disbursements he musx; have another source of revenue. A secret loan from Branch is the most favoured solution. 63. During the last few months, the King has also persuaded a number of Shaikhs who were living in exile in Iraq and elsewhere to return. His reason is reported to be that the presence of such people abroad detracts from the impression of unity and accord which he evidently desires to foster. 64. Yemen War. A Syrian journalist and newspaper proprietor of Damascus who was present at Sana during the recent war stated that, in his opinion, if the Armistice had not been agreed upon. Bin Saud would have been heavily attacked and nis communications with Hodeida cut, by a large force concentrated on Saada. (Kuwait Int. Summary). 65. This version agrees with the opinion of many Arabs, v/hich have aleady been reported. 66. Arabian Mission . Dr. Dame, (American), left Bahrain in the middle of February for Riyath and Bin Saud’s camp at Khafs. The Mission prior to departure is reported to have received a letter from the King welcoming their visit. (Bahrain Int. Summary.) SHIPPING Ai^D TRADE IN THE GULF &gt; 67. Japanese. S.S.SAIKOK MRU visited Bahrain on 3rd February, and after landing piece goods, left for Bushire. 68. S.S. LISBON MARU arrived at Mohammerah on 25th January, discharged general cargo, and after visiting Basrah, finally passed down river on 5th February. 69. Geiyaan^ A representative of Messrs.

He is also reported to have taken a marked interest in the landing ground at Muharraq. After a fortnights stay he left for Bushire. (Bahrain Int. Report.) 70. Persian . Trade Agreement with Denmark . The Treaty of Friendship and Commerce has been ratified hy the Persian Government. (Le Messager). 71. Hungarian. M.Etienne Horthy, son of the Regent of Hungary, visited Tehran from mid-January to mid-Fehruary. He is reported as representing manufacturers of his country and the visit was primarily to study the economic situation in Persia. (Le Messager). OIL _ IM’ERFSTS . 72. Qatar. Mr. Mylles returned to Qatar early in February to resume negotiations on behalf of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company with the Shaikh. A wireless set, which works with Bahrain Radio, has now been installed on the peninsula. 73. Rumours are current in Bahrain that Major Holmes, of the Kuwait Oil Company, is in communication with the Shaikh of Qatar and that he has promised him tetter financial terms than the A.P.O.C. (Bahrain Int. Report.) 74. With regard to the preceding paragraph and to anticipate the next Intelligence Report. Major Holmes told my staff officer that he intenoed to try for the Qatar Concession, only if the A.P.O.C. failed. It will he remembered that the A.P.O.C. extension of exploration rights terminates on the 10th April 1935. Major Holmes, it was understood, had the hacking of two financial groups in London, and favours the establishment of a wholly British Company on the Qatar Peninsula. He has little faith in A.P.O.C. enterprise or methods hut this is hardly surprising considering the way they refused to take up his Bahrain Concession some years ago. 75. Major Holmes also credits the Standard Oil Company-with.further designs on Qatar and according to wi. uii xiim a ouxiceaaiL__ _ __ Jn view of the strong, attitude adopted by H.M. government in April 1934, when the Shaikh of Qatar was reminded That he could not grant a concession without Government approval, the American chances, fortunately, appear small. 76. Bahrain . The oiler RHEEM arrived from the U.S.A. on 10th January and after embarking about 15,000 tons of crude oil, left for Japan on 12th January. The ship is expected to return early in March. 77. As a memento of the signing of the Mining Lease in December the Company have presented the Shaikh with a Buick saloon car. 78. Some machinery and material inported by the /CompanyCompany has recently 'been re-exported to the mainland for use of the Standard Oil Company. (Bahrain Int. Report.) 79. In Major Holmes’ opinion, the Bahrain petrol eum Company have reached a depth of about 4000 feet in their experimental well, and nave found a second layer oi oil underneath the first. His information's that they have not yet reached primary rock. He anticipates a very large yield from the field in the future, an opinion he also ventured some eight months ago before the experimental well was sunk. 80. Hasa. The Anerican geologists have recently been examining the country just South of the Kuwait Neutral Zone but did not actually enter this territory. It is quite possible that oil exists in the zone, as there are sulphur springs, and according to the R.A.P.Intellig ence Report, the American Company have already approached Bin Saud on the Subject of a concession. The King, however, was reported to be most discouraging as he felt sure that H.M. Government, through the Shaikh of Kuwait, v/ould never give their consent. 81. Meanwhile it is reported that a pier, 1000 ft. long and v/ith 6 ft. depth at sea end, has been built at A1 Akhbar. A derrick has also been erected in the hills behind Damman. Both these places are near Qatif. It is understood that the Company are experiencing some difficulty over personnel as the Saudi Government insist on the employment of their own nationals. It will be interesting lo see whether Has Tanurah will be developed as an oil port. (Bahrain &amp; Kuwait Int. Summaries.) 82. Kuwait . In a letter to the Shaikh, Major. Holmes reported that as a result of his visit to London the working capital of the Kuwait Oil Company has been increased considerably. 83. It is reported that the Bedouins are anxiously v/aiting the commencement of work as they hope to be employed by the Company. 84. In conversation, Major Holmes said that the geologists are arriving at Kuwait about 15th March and that he expects to commence drilling in October. One of the geologists, an Anerican, is the same man as located the oil at Bahrain for Major Holmes some five years ago. Harbour works will follow the discovery of oil. 85. Qishm Island. Drilling continues at Cargeh, and it is reported that a depth of 5000 feet has now been reached. So far oil is not forthcoming. * * CAPTAIN, SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER PERSIAN GULF.

It is understood that ohe of the four cast off his uniform and refused to work, and was consequently placed in prison in deshabille. £.- The men T s grievancewas that they had received no pay for the past two months and they were rash enough to suggest that the Leputy Governor had withheld it. This state of affairs nas since been remedied, and the men have now been re-instated in the Force. 3. Registrataon of Boats. In mid-January, H.to. kinister again asked the Persian Government to postpone any further demand for the registration of the R.I.N. boats on the grounds that:- (a) Both he and the Commander-in-Chief had seen the regulations v/hieh only dealt with passenger boats and were therefore inapplicable. (b) Shah, at the audience he gave to the Commander- in-Chief. (see para.21 below) laid stress on co-operation between the two Navies. (c) At same audience question had arisen of finding some solution of our outstanding difficulties. 4. iii-Clii ^ l t £.,Vi s it t -hen the Commander-in-Chief visited Hen Jam in HAWKINS early in the month, the Leputy Governor did not call, and this omission was mentioned to the Shah by the Commanaer-in-fChief at Tehran.

A comdaliit was received recently by H.k. kinister from tne Persian Government that in November last, several of the inhabitants of Persian lasidu took refuge in the British area when police came to summon them for conscription. 7. The above has not been confirmed, while on the other hand, in Lecember, 17 men proceeded voluntarily to Bunder Abbas as they had teen warned they were due for military service. Eight of these men were passed as fit for service, and were given a few month f s grace by the authorities, being told that they would eventually be '•% required for service in the Persian Naw. v8. It is clear however that should such a situation arise as in para. 6 above, it mi^ht lead to complications as several members of the British area have taken out Persian registration. ..ithout these 'sijills', the inhabitants of the British area cannot enter Persian territory and are therefore debarred from trading, etc. 9. This question will be discussed with H.k. Minister during his Gulf cruise in SHORBKAM in February. TxilOIAL GGAST 10. |uph? Flagstaff Incident Residency Agent proceeded to nas-al-Khaimah the , 1 'mm , early in January with instructions from the Honourable the political Resident to find out from the Shaikh the meaning of his extraordinary action and to remind him of his treaty engagements. 11. Isa reported later that the Shaikh’s desire is to make some money out of the island, and particularly he feels that H.M. Government should pay rent for the lighthouse. A hint that if we were not prepared to pay, that 'someone else'might do so, is considered by the Residency Agent to be bluff. 12. The situation developed further at the end of the month under report. Mahmood, the headman of the island, left in a Persian dhow for the Trucial Coast on 23rd lecember. Two days later a Tunb dhow visiting the island of Kishm was asked by Shaikh Abdullah the headman of Khani to take a roll, containing what appeared to be printed notices, to the island. This roll'was stated to have come from Bunder Abbas and Shaikh Abdullah certainly appeared anxious for it to reach the island without delay. The Mudir of Persian Easidu also tried to persuade the I^a&amp;hoda to ta&amp;e it. As a receipt was required and the hsJkhoda of the dhow was loath to accept responsibility, the package Was still at Kishm Island at the end of the month* 13. »-hile at Kishm Island the Nakhoda and members of the dhow f s crew were told by a local official that a Persian Customs post would shortly be established on the island. 14. This offers some confirmation of the impression that a plot exists between the Shaikh of has-al-Knaimah and the Persian Government for the latter to take over the island* It is considered, however, tliat with the constant presence of a sloop at Tunb, the plot may not be pursued. m. A* I s realised that a sloop cannot remain at Tunb indefinitely and that the island must fly a flar and the Honourable the Political Resident therefore recommends that:- (a) his flag prepared the Shaikh should be warned that if he replaces within a certain period, H.M. Government are to consider paying him rent for the lighthouse.l rtaiin fcfrrnii fiirft tot . ^ t • • ' * ' r., i\e i 4 OVM ex» to wedtef I^evse aa e ' f m&amp;ii .fi lOvTas itoaa^BO Barca iCai^irca ail^ xc # 4,H rtfiw l)833if08i&amp; ecf XXt^ noi * .^ijp T , T f ‘ ( f] r J'.-r.». -•■ '• e j )m , r.? 1 , li -‘i n -X;-- -• ■ v' &gt;9.5300U'iCf ^ ,•-&gt;- ‘Xo - lid to ; - A iiflaoffi arfJ diiis-id flient joo onit Ot rrcfasnct airi to &amp; 1 ;i -x c ^ j iu ■ no I il oa -1 ■ ai ^ - • : ’ x t * 1 ; ; / W .; . • • r'. r . _ .

A reception 17. Tepai. Yjall fll of the Shaikhs who haa come to call on the Commander-m- Chief was held on board HANKINS at lebai at the end of the month. It was attended by the Shaikhs of lebai. Sharjah, AJman and Hamriyah. Unfortunately bad weather prevented Abu Lhabi from attending while Umm all Quain sent a message expressing his regret that he had been taken ill. In view of the flagstaff incident it was not surprising that has-al-Khaimah did not put in an appear ance. 18. S ta t e,T^M&gt; LUPIN.reported that early in January H.H. the Multan, who is still at Bombay, was negotiating for the purchase of the steamer CHAMPAVATI which was formerly the twin screw minesweeper ; BRAlHlKi-l. 19. As it was not considered that the ship would be suitable as a yacht, and that it would not receive the necessary attention at Muscat to prolong its already lengthy life, LUPIN was asked by the Honourable the Political resident to discourage the idea. 20. The K^CU.E. was conferred on Sh&amp;ikh Hamad in the New Year's honours. The Senior Naval officer sent a message of congratulation. * * 22. Persian ijavv. When HAWKINS was proceeding from Basrah to Abacan a national salute was fired off the mouth of the Karun River. This was returned, and followed by a personal salute to the Commander-in-Chief. During the visit to Abadan, officers of both Navies had ample opportunity of meeting at functions arranged on board. 23. The Persian naval officers were most interested and impressed by the Commander-in-Chief 1 s visit to Tehran. Before the latter's return, Bayendor informed the Senior Naval Officer that the Shah had given the Uommander-in- Ohief a long audience, even going into details of the times the audience haa commenced and finished. One or two of the Persian naval officers who were very friendly expressed the opinion that the Commander-in-Chief's visit would generally make things easier for the Persian Navy.tr ^ 4 ^ / 31. 24. jOi^andGy Eavendor .

(Enclosure ho.2) (H.M.3. BIDEFORI ) . 28. Liitoipd,. b .^Q,yrl t y. It is reported in the Tehran papers that a rebellion has broken out in Baluchistan. (Be Messager). This is the first time that news of the unrest, which has been prevailing for months, has been published. 29. Baluchi Refugees. k lar^e party of these Balucnis are reported 19 have been m tercepted by a Customs boat with a military guard on board. Rumour has it that the Baluchis in the dhow took cover on the approach of their aggressors, and holding their fire in the traditional manner until the Customs boat was close along side, they then opened such a withering fdsilade that a number of the soldiers were killed or wounded. This battle appears to have had a sequel. A report from a Persian source emanating from Bunder Abbas states that that after collecting another guard and some machine guns the Customs boat again intercepted the Baluchi dhow. On this occasion the range was considerably greater and the dhow is said to have beeh-riddled with bullets that it was sunk with all hands. Other reports, however, state that the dhow evaded pursuit and it has since been seen near Khassab. Its crew is alleged to number about 100 Baluchis, and operations up to the present have been confined to attacks on Persian villages and dhows. (BITEFOKI, Master BABPETA, Clerk i/c Henjam). 30. Afghanistan. The Afghan Government are reported to have replied to the Persian protest regarding the frontier raid as follows:- (a) That the alleged capture of 200 Persians was in reality a voluntary migration of Persians which has been occurring during the last few months owing to discontent with Persian Administration. (b) That these migrating Persians had attacked a Persian frontier post while en route to Afghanistan. The latest report is that both Governments have agreed in principle to the appointment of a joint commission of investigation. (A.A.F. Int. Summary.)appears probable that the departure from i*,eshec of the Persian Minister of the Interior and the ...fsihan Ambassador for lurabad reported in 'Le i essa; er' is in connection with this commission. i.-es^a fe er * (£gd.)

' Sir, HfiPOIiT OF VISIT TO PERSIAN GUNEOAT 'BABR' ON 20TH JANUARY 1935. I have the honour to report that three officers from FIPEFOKB called and were warmly received hy an Officer of the Persian Gunboat ?, EAER'. Commandant Bayendor and the remaining officers, with the exception of the Officer of the lay, who was v/earing a dirk and was much in evidence on the gangway, were ashore. 2. After sitting and talking on the Quarter leek, during which tinie we were offered English cigarettes and coffee we asked if we could walk round the ship. The officer agreed most willingly and though apologising for parts which he said were dirty, appeared very proud of the chip. 3. GENERAL APPEAMiiW fim , The Quarter Leek was definitely clean. The paintwork having obviously been i^asMd^durihg the last two days. 4. » Although the time was about noon the guns were still covered. There appeared to be no sights or training wheels on the right of the guns, all laying and training being done on the left hatidside. The size of the larger guns are 102 mms. Full calibre shoots are carried out occasionally but sub-calibre firings more frecmently, at a range of about 1000 metres. The bridge contained a stereo rangefinder of about six foot base but no director. An Italian built searchlight (24' approximately) was mounted before the rangefinder. 5. NAVIGATIONAL . The Officer of the ^atch keeps his watch in the Wheelhouse which is just forward of the Chart House before the bridge. The bridge, which possess canvas screens of about 3 feet in height, was described as being 'too cold for watchkeeping'. The vheelhouse contained a singular shortage of voicepipes. ( In the Chart house were an assortment of Charts, mostly English; the Persian Gulf Pilot (Seventh edition) was much in evidence. Anltalian 'echo sounding' machine was fitted on the port side of the Chart house. / Thesaid The officer acting as guide/this was now f not much used as he knew the depths’. 1 The bridge and wheelhouse both contained hoards with the colours of the International Code Flags painted on them. The steering was electric. 6. The main engines consisted of 2 Flat diesels and were kept very clean. Owing to the inflexibility of this type of engine there is considerable difficulty in manoeuvring, especially when negotiating the turn from the river into Karun anchorage at wMamirierah. The remainder of the tii^e, owing to the difficulties of slow running these ships travel at full speed; their maximum speed Is 17 knots. Electricity is used throughout the ship with the exception of the Capstan and evaporating plant which are steam. Boats are hoisted by power. All pipes are marked in distinctive colouring. The crew’s washing arrangements consisted of six large tubs of water placed on the forecastle. Four boats are carried, of which two are on davits, one of these being a motor launch. There are small skiffs stowed inboard.. In 'BABR' an extra motor boat is supplied apparently as a barge. The officers 1 cabins are of good size; the Senior Officer has a suite consisting of a day cabin, a Seeping cabin, and a bathroom. The Cabins and dining rooms are panelled. She rifles are kept in the cabin flat, with the exception of 6 stowed in a rack on the Quarter leek for the use of the guard. Qftie six have the bayonets fixed. All rifles appear in excellent condition. The forecastle backbone and awning ridge ropes were rusty and badly looked after but a 3” wire on the Quarter Deck (probably a berthing wire) was well greased and kept in good condition. W.T. Hatches were fitted with composition washers instead of rubbers and had only two clips on them. All awnings were kept furled owing to the sparks emitted by the diesels when running. 8. mLmtiL. The officer acting as guide appeared a very well educated and keen officer and he spoke quite good Lnglish. He said that all their ships would be cleaner if only their officers lived on board while at mohammerah. The ship’s complement is 8 officers and 75 men of whom 35 are Seamen. Nearly all are Arabs, many of thorn cannot speak Persian.'NDEXED ) Any further communication should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l quoting CONFIDENTIAL 26th March, /.‘AJS.'''

This lapse was mentioned to H.I.M. The 3hah by the Commander-in-Chief when he received an audience during his visit to Tehran later in the month. 6. As already reported by signal events in the flagstaff case appear to have reached a deadlock. The Shaikh of Ras-al-^haimaii seems determined not to replace his flag until he receives a settlement to his claim for rent for the light-house, knowing that the island will be carefully guarded by II.M.Ships in the meantime. A second Instalment of this affair occurred at the end of the month. In this case a native of Tunb was asked by officials on idshm Island to taue a letter from Tehran to Tunb. The native refused, but the following dayit Persian dhow from Lingeh arrived at Tanb, and took Mahmood to Has-al-iihaimah. It is therefore quite possiole tiiat the letter was also ta^en in this eoat. The address on the letter is not Known, but it does nots#ig^ impossible that it was intended for the Jhaikh. 7. The above na^if^also stated that it ?/as the Persian intention to Visit Tunb early in February to try to collect taxes and possibly hoist the Persian flag. A sloop was stationod there after receipt of this information but nothing further has transpired. * * * mm- 11- 'HAWKINS^* and 'SHGREHALT arrived at Muscat at 0900 35th January, but owing to the serious illness of the Fleet Accountant officer, the former only remained an hour to collect mails and provisions before sailing for Bombay. IB. It had been arranged therefore that a national salute should be fired the following day and that I should call on the President of the Uouncil for the Commander-in- Chief. On being informed of the serious illness of a passenger who had been landed from the ■Blow Mail 1 , H.H. the ^nl-han'ci vp snu^ested that salutes and calls h January. jr — — 9 jultan T s representative s should be deferred until 9 13. A strong shemal blew up on the forenoon of T#he B7th January and ^3H0R2^^AM ,, shifted berth to Mat rah where there is a sharaal anchorage. Even so there was a heavy swell, and it was 39th January before wind and sea had'abated sufficiently for ,f SHORSHAM'’ to return to Muscat. 14. A national salute was accordingly fired at 0800 on 30th January and later in the forenoon calls were exchanged with'the President of the Council. I explained the circumstances which made it impossible for the Commander- in-Chief to stay at Muscat and also thanked the Sultan f s representative xor his thoughtfulness in deferring salutes while the above mentioned passenger ?/as so ill. he was accorded a salute of 13 guns on his departure. * * * CAPTAIN.
