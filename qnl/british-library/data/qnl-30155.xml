Recently I saw one of the China steamers blown from her anchorage across the harbour on to the rocks. This accident was attributable to the fact that the presence of the^shpu** wreck in the best anchorage forces shipping to anchor at the mouth of the Muscat cove, where it is exposed to the north wind and strong currents. 3. Besides danger to shipping, ships are often very considerably delayed through the impossibility of bringing lighters up to them during strong north winds. Were ships properly in the harbour they could be worked in almost all weathers, dhen two ships happen to be in Muscat at the same time in bad weather the difficulties and dangers are, of course, aggravated. 4. From the above it will be seen that from both the marine and the commercial aspects it is desirable that the wreck should be removed, and I should be grateful, therefore, if the authorities could be asked to undertake this before the coming winter.

If the last two stages of this plan are unsuccessful, lifting craft will have to be employed for raising the wreck and it will then be necessary to find a convenient place where beaching can be affected. When this method is employed it is apparently impossible for a wreck to be released without beach ing. A suitable place outside Muscat harbour will be selected for this purpose in consultation with His Highness. No. c.368-16/19 Dated the 6111 “ay* 1946 Muscat, /fee * To BRITAIN, BUSH IRE . 2.

Although the hard work which led to the successful outcome ol the operation will doubtless be recognised from tho proper quarter, as one who can fully appreciate the Tory difficult and unpleasant conditions under which the operation was carried through,, I should like to send you e l.7 ny personal congratulations. ^uocat^ climate is recognised by being one of the worst in the world and, that it should have been possible i or tho work to be carried on through the worst months of the hot weather, is, in ay view, a great achievement deserving the highest praise. I must confess that when I heard that operations were to begin in May and realised ho*&gt; complete was the lack of shore flscillties at Fjuscat, I felt that salvage work would have to be broken off during the worst months of heat. 2. To many of you this was probably 'Just another Job*. To the 'Muscat Government and qyself, however, the clearing of the harbour wbb a matter of great importance are! no one is more grateful to you and the Salvage Party than His Highness the Sultan. The removal of the wreck makes possible the improvement of harbour f acllltles and the speeding up of the turn round of shipping which is so much needed. 3. In offering you all aboard Sal viola and the Lifting Craft wy personal congratulations, I should like to add that if there is any way in which you feel I can help in securing a pt rj.c.! oi v'xtrj'u leave or other concession of this nature to the Salvage Party, I shall be very glad to do so.

We were very pleased on the morning of October the 8th, when we saw the Dapu towed from the Muscat Harbour where it remained ever since it was sunk, three years ago. During this period, she was something that disfigured the habbour’s appearance, and was probably an hinderance to boats anchoring inside the harbour as was usual before. Undoubtedly, the lifting of the wreck “Dapu' was done after much hard labour and with very great ski&amp; by the members of the Navy to whom this work was Entrusted under the direction of Lt.Cdr.Walker &amp; Capt.

Dear Sir, I recently received your letter dated Dec.6th related to my medical bill to the Muscat Salvage Party, lour letter was long in getting here and I am afraid my reply will take an equally long time reaching you. I am sorry that I can’t give you the details that you want. l was too busy taking care of the members of the salvage party as well as running my hospital for the Arabs here to keep detailed records of my treatments and examination. I was simply asked by Lt. C4r. John to act as medical consultant for the party and was told verbally that a fee of rupees four hundred for every month that they were under my care or the care of my assistant, Dr. William Lakra, would be paid me in due course oi time. I jgave Cdr. Walker a written report of the type of diseases met with among his men and also the treatment given. During the course of the five months Dr. Lakra or I saw (examined or treatedl almost everyone of the party. Fortunately there were no major acciaents nor operations but we were prepared to care for the men surgically as well as medically. We used our fluoroscope a good many times to check up on chests and bones. At times I was tre ting as many as eight officers and ratings of the Royal flavy in my own home. These men were suffering from septic prickley heat, boils, abscesses, and mental depression. I enclose a copy of my annual report in which I mention the salvage party They were a splendid group of men who handled one of the toughest jobs on earth. I was glad to be their medical officer for a while. Sincerely yours, Sgd. Wells Thoms M.D.1 Sc, Dated 22nd February, 1947.

'Unfortunately, however, oilr^ to the fact that like most charitable institutions, the hcs t it 1 is terribly under- stafftid for the work which it is called on to perform, Dr. Thoms was unable tc find timu to maintain a detailed register of attendance. lie can, therefore, supply no actual figures or details of work porformod.
