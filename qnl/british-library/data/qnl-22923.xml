W. 1 10th January, 1934 0 Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you consideration a statement contained in paragraph ? of Mr« Mallet’s telegram Wo* 265 of the 15th October , a ciopy ol which is enclosed, to the effect that the Persian Minister for For eign Affairs recently claimed a ten-mile limit for Persain terr itorial waters. 2. As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, there is no international agreement laying down tr-e limit of territorial waters for all countries* His MajestyJbs G-overnment in the U ited Kingdom claim three mj,les only, but Persia is by no means alone in claiming more; indeed at the Canference forthe Codification of International Law held at the Hague in 1930, while most of the i important maritime states claimed no more thf^g/ three miles, tney in a minority. At that Conference, it may be recalled, tne Persain representatives claimed a limit oi six miles li&amp;ii* plus an adjacent zone, the breadth of which does not appear to have t been specified. Although the Persian representative did not himself give any explanation of the prupose for which this adjacent zone was clammed by his Government , the majority of other States which put forward a similar claim on this oceasiom made it clear that they required the adjacent zone partly at least for purposes of customs control* The Under Secretary t&gt;f State, India Office* /y* 5 ./ • :2s (4 3 # The ten mile limit recently claimed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first sight to be incompatible with the claimmade in 1930 by the Tersian representative at the Conference* but it may well be that Kazemi had in mind the adjacent zone when mentioning the higher figure* Whatever may be th^precise wxtent of the Persia- n claim * it is evident that if ti includes an adjacent zone it cannot be far short of the ten-mile limit* 4 # Int he absence of any international agreement* it ia* in Sir John Simon’s view, impossible to base a refusal to accept the Persian ^overnmentfa claim to a ten-mile limit upon the international position • Not would it appear disirable to base such a refusal upon thafact that the Persian claim at the 1930 conference was not to a ten mile limit* since to do oj auwai would go near to bring an acceptance of the claim to a «ix mile limit and an adjacent zone* which would be contrarey to the general policy of His Maj estyle Government in t he United Kr Kingdom on the subject, In these circumstances, it cannot be expected that the Persian Government will admit the justice &lt; of any complaints regarding interference with shipping by the Persian coast, in cases where it would be a sound defence that the action was taken within the limits of f ersian territor ial waters * It appears therefoe to Sie John Himon that 9 while peotests should in such cases continue to be made in orde. to safeguard the principle of a three mile limit, His Majesty’s Government hare no means of enforcing their view*5® Subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare Sir John Simon proposes to inform His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran ofthe position as set forth above for his guidance 9 and he suggests that it may be desirable that the Political dLmmi Resident in the Perian uulf should take steps to warn the masters of vessels from the Arab States o^the Persian tiulf in ant suitable terms of the practical effects of the Persian xix claim to ten-mile limit of territorial waters® 6® Asimilar letter is being sent to theAdmiralty® I am, sir.

Ifv Lor^s are of opinion that thr Persian :iinistrr e or y 0 -ei‘nr!

As the claim *as put forward so informally, and as Mr Mallet took the opportunity to say +hat H.M. 04ye-nmert would never admit it, there appears to he no necessity ior an A ’ mo^e i^rformril repudiation. 3. 'Thile My fcords have no objection to Sir W^ginald Hoare being informed o** the position wuith regard to terri torial watersthe^ would most b trough deprecate that the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf should take any ac tion such as that suggested in ■ aragra.ph 5 yo^r le ter as, in addition to its bad effect on British prestige ir the Gulf, it would limit the area in which H.M.
