            Cruizer
                           Aurora, which is
            on her way to Bahrain. The precise instructions are outlined in the letter. It notes
            that the Resident agrees with the instructions already given to the vessel, which will
            investigate the ongoing dispute between Rahma bin Ahmed and Abdella bin Ahmed [‘Abdullāh
            bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah], Chief of Bahrain; both chiefs accuse the other of committing
            acts of piracy.It is noted that resolving the dispute will be further
            complicated now that Rahma bin Ahmed is claiming protection from Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl
            Sa‘īd, Imam of Muscat. It explains that this is in opposition to what his circumstances
            were considered to be previously; it is explained that Rahma bin Ahmed was considered to
            to under the protection of Persia, and responsible to Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā, Prince at
            Sheraz [Shiraz], which has previously guided British actions towards him. It is
            explained that the Resident's position is that Rahma bin Ahmed's status in the
            Persian Gulf should be finally determined.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x00004b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
