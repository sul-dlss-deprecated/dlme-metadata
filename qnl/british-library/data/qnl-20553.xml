Present; Sir Louis Kershaw .* Mr. C.P.A. Warner Mr. K.R. Johnstone Mr.J.0 .Walton Mr. J.G.Laithwaite Ivlr. G.E.Crombie Mr. Praser Mr. Lefroy In the ('Chair Foreign Office India Office A.P.O.C. Mr. Fraser explained that the A .p.O.C, had not yet 'been able to approach the Sheikh of Koweit about a concession in the Neutral Zone since they were anxious first to finish off their Koweit Oil Com pany negotiations with the Sheikh. In answer to questions from Sir Louis Kershaw, Mr. Praser said that he had had a discussion with Mr. Moffat of the Standard Oil Company of California, who had told him that the Standard Oil had definitely 'got the concession' in the XTeutral Zone as far as Ibn Saud was concerned. Mr. Moffat's advice to the I.P.O. had been to go ahead and get a concession for Koweit and then cooperate with the Standard Oil. Mr. Fraser had been entirely non-committal in regard to this. He disliked the idea of having any dealings at all with the Standard Oil of California in respect of the area inside the red line, in view of the constitution and history of the I.P.C., since this would inevitably result in the Americans obtaining.a bigger share in the I.P.O. territory than the other parties represented in the I.P.C. He was, of course, treading on somewhat delicate ground in discussing with Mr. Moffat/© !? Moffat the intentions of the Standard Oil in the Neutral Zone. The I.P.O. had also heen in touch with the Arabian Oil Development Syndicate. Mr, Janson had told him that YdliM had left Jedda on the 23rd March and was now on his way home with a view to proceeding later to Koweit for discussions with the Sheikh. Mr. Janson though he had no definite knowledge, inferred that Ydlibi must certainly have obtained a concession in a more or less final form from Ibn Saud. Mr, ¥arner said that official information from Jedda confirmed that Ydlibi had left on the 23rd March but apparently no definite agreement had been concluded with the Saudi Government* The Saudis had communicated to Sir Andrew Ryan the terms offered by Ydlibi and had told him that they were now communicating these terms to the Standard Oil of California in accordance with their agreement with 11 -i ii •the latter. Some discussion took place as to the terms of the option which the Standard Oil was said to have obtained from Ibn Saud on a Neutral Zone concession. The information obtained both by 'the A.P.O.C. and by the Foreign Office was to the effect that the option represented ''Preference on equal terms'♦ Mr. Warner exDlained that the Standard Oil option was contained in the secret portion of the agreement between Ibn Saud and the Standard Oil about the Hasa concession. The Foreign Office information about it had been obtained by Sir Andrew Ryan from various confidential sources and the arrangement had only been referred to in somewhat vague terms by representatives of the Saudi Government Mr,/Mr. Praser would of course understand that it should 'be kept confidential. He suggested that if the Standard Oil Company agreed to a concession on the terms already proposed 'by Ydlihi when these terms were shown to them by the Saudi Government it might be that the Saudi Government would not be prevented by the option given to the Standard Oil from approaching Ydlibi again in the hopes of persuading him to improve on his previous offer. Mr. Fraser on the other hand thought that the Standard Oil option was more likely to mean that the latter company would have the right to clinch an agreement at once with the Saudi Government on the terms offered by Ydlibi. He suggested that the Standard Oil would probably clinch the bargain at once unless Ydlibi's terms were extremely wild. Sir Louis Kershaw enquired whether the I,P.O. were not missing their chance, of a concession by not at once entering into negotiations with Ibn Saud or the Sheikh. Mr. Fraser explained that the A.P.0.0, had some time before brought home a suitable man with a view to employing him in negotiations with Ibn Saud but they had decided that it was no use for the I.P.O. as a third party, to enter into these negotiations in view of the information that the Standard Oil had already obtained an option on the Neutral Zone and that Ydlibi also appeared to have reached some sort of agreement with the Saudis. He thought that whatever terms the I.P.O. offered would certainly be capped at once by the Standard Oil. In his opinion the only course open to the I.P.O. was to approach the Sheikh of Koweit and try to obtain from him an option in the Neutral Zone similar to that which the Standard Oil had obtained from Ibn Saud. The result would then be in the first instance a position of stalemate, but he hinted/4. hinted that the I.P.C. might find themselves in a stronger position vis-a-vis the Standard Oil of California after he had had some further discussion with Mr, Moffat about the marketing of the Standard Oil Company's production in Bahrein. It was difficult for the A.P.O.C. negotiator ? Mr. Chisholm, to approach the Sheikh about the Neutral Zone until Major Holmes, who, as Mr, Praser knew, wished to enter into, negotiations with the Sheikh on his own account about the Neutral Zone, had leftKoweit, The A.P.O.C. were accordingly anxious that the Koweit Oil Company's negotiations should be concluded as quickly as possible. He said that these negotiations were being held up at present by the fact that the Sheikh had not been given a copy of the political agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company. Mr. Warner said that official information tended to show that it was the question of money which was holding things up. Mr, Fraser however, read a telegram which the A.P.OoC. had received from the Gulf saying that the Sheikh was becoming suspicious because he had not been given a copy of the agreement and that this was holding up the negotiations. It was agreed that the India Office should at once telegraph to the Political Resident saying that the text of the agreement might be given to the Sheikh and Mr. Fraser , though he could not indicate any definite time, hoped that it might then be possible to conclude the negotiations at an early date. S ir Louis Kershaw then asked Mr. Warner how he thought the position would develop at Jedda in the interval supposing that Mr, Chisholm would be in a position to. approach the Sheikh about the Neutral Zone towards the end of this month. Mr. /5. Mr. Warner said that Ydlibi's terms were now being shown to the Standard Oil and that much would- depend on the actual form of the Standard Oil option.. If the Standard Oil were able to take up an agreement on Ydlibi's terms so far as Ibn Saud's interest was concerned, the Saudi Government might then ask whether the Sheikh of Koweit and/or H.M.G. would agree to the same terms in respect of the Koweit interest. H.M.G. wOuld be placed in a difficult position if there was still no other competitor in the field except Ydlibi. Sir Louis Kershaw said that the negotiations might have progressed so far between Ibn Saud and the Standard Oil as to make matters extremely difficult for the I.P.O. at Koweit. The A.P.O.C. representatives said that it was no use sending a negotiator to Jedda no?/ when Ydlibi's negotiations had proceeded so far and when Ydlibi himself was on his way home. Mr. Fraser was sure that when Ydlibi arrived in London Mr, Janson would not lose a moment before getting in touch with the I.P.O., and there would then be an opportunity to obtain further information about Ydlibi's offer to Ibn Saud and about the California Standard Oil Company's option about the terms of which Ydlibi ought to have a very good idea. Mr, Fraser himself had never liked the idea of working through the Arabian Development Syndicate etc., but he agreed with Sir Louis Kershaw that the I.P.O. did not want to close the door finally on the idea of backing Ydlibi if this should turn out to be necessary. Mr.Warner pointed out that this would leave Sir Andrew Ryan in an extremely awkward position. It was now a long time since the Saudi/6 ' Saudi Government had asked him for His Majesty's Government's views about the standing of YdliM and he was still putting them off without a reply. The Foreign Office had hoped that the I«P.C. would have heen a'ble to tell them at this meeting whether or not they intended to use Ydlihi but it appeared that they could not yet do so, Mr. Yfarner said that the Foreign Office would instruct Sir Andrew Ryan to keep up his non committal attitude in his discussions with the Saudi Government but he wished to emphasise the difficulty of the Ministers Position. He thought that if the I.P.O. succeeded in getting an option on the Neutral Zone from the Sheikh of Eoweit, the Foreign Office might not improbably think this the best solution of the immediate difficulty, Mr. Fraser suggested that the Standard Oil might ■ only want the Neutral Zohe concession because of its nuisance value. Mr. Walton mentioned that he had heard from Mr. Kemp of the A,P.0,0, that there was some suggestion of inviting the Sheikh of Koweit to this country as the guest of the Koweit Oil Company, He reminded Mr, Fraser that this was a matter which would raise political questions, Mr, Fraser said that no action had yet been taken* He could not say whether or not the I.P.C, might decide that an invitation . to the Sheikh was necessary in order to clinch their negotiations, At any rate he promised that nothing would be done in the matter without prior consultation with the India Office. Sir/7. Sir Louis Kershaw sumrned up the conclusions of . the meeting as follOY /s;- (1) the Koweit Oil Company's negotiations to 'be concluded as quickly as possible. In order to facilitate this the India Office would at once instruct the Resident that the Sheikh should be given a copy of the Government Agreement; (2) the Foreign Office to send a full explanation of the present position to Sir Andrew Ryan and instruct him to continue his non committal attitude on the subject of Ydlibi at Jedda; (3) that the-I.P.C. should without delay obtain ^ . ^ ■ hi i n iinn ' * tm further information about Ydlibi's offer to Ibn Saud and the California Standard Oil Company's option when Ydlibi arrived in London, (4) that the I.P.O. might be able to gauge more clearly the strength of their position vis-a-vis the Standard Oil after Mr. Eraser's further discussions with Mr. Moffat.2MI 1 By Air Mail Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office e India Office, Whitehall, -London, S.W.I.

While an inland site need not be ruled out altogether, it la | obviously desirable for communication, supply and defence purposes that any air base should be on or near the sea coast* 3* Articles and 9 of the agreement between the Sheikh and the ooapany deal with the aoquieition of land in connection with oil envelopment works and give the company discretion to purohase or lease Caterer land they may consider necessary, subject to consultation with the lithwaite Ssq#.

That being so, it i» not easy to suggest a compromise proposition which would meet our possible future retirementa in respect of land wnich is not leased or purchased now# 4» It is possible, however, that in the event of the ooapany raising the question of acquiring site (a) # the Sheikh could be persuaded to make an attempt to exclude it, more especially if an alternative area, which would suit the company equally well, were available* No doubt the Sheikh, with the advice of the Political Agent, could find some very good ostensible reason for attempting to exclude site (a)» 5* We can hardly expect the Sheikh to adopt a course which w ould result in financial loss to hiinself, and if the company make him a good offer and decline to accept an alternative, then I fear we must resign ourselves to the loss of site (a)* On the other hand, as an inducement to the Sheikh to reserve that area against our possible future requirement he could be toldj- (i) that we have no intention of developing it at present, and he could therefore continue to use it himself; (ii) if we do eventually desire to use the areaWe would be prepared to pay a reasonable price to do so* 6* Another alternative would be for us to select and reserve some other area if one can be found which would be suitable for the construction of an air base« I attach draft of a telegram which we would be prepared to send to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, ask/ing him to carry out &amp; further reconnaissance, if you agree* Action on these lines can be taken while you are continuing discussions with the Sheikh on the lines of paragraphs 4 and 5 above, and in the event of your further negotiations being/&amp; being unauccesaful we might then be in a position to put forward proposals for the safeguarding of some alternative area. 7* I am sending copies of this letter and attachment to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department* Yours, «£c»| (Sgd.)

I am taking up the point raised in paragraph 7 of your letter with our Legal Adviser and will write to you again about it in a day or two. 3. In the meantime, I should be grateful if you would consider the following point in connection with your paragraph 2. If the Air Ministry now decide not to take up iiihinntmru-imi site (a) but to rest content with the acquisition of rights Talid against the Koweit Oil Company (if these can be secured) in respect of moorings for a flying boat anchorage opposite the quarantine site, the risk ought not 'to be overlooked that,if eventually they require a base in r—nn: . „ •imandor W.A.McClaughry, Koweit/ |0» ?

You may possibly if you think these considerations material wish to consider further the line to be taken with the Sheikh of Koweit as regards site (a). It is, of course, a nuisance that he will not sell this site outright, but (though it may be difficult to look a gift horse in the mouth, and his present offer is certainly not ungenerous from his standpoint when compared with the rent which he drew from us for many years for the Bunder Shweikh area) it might be possible to go back to him, if on further examination you thought that desirable, with some compromise proposition. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Pe t ro leum D e par true nt. Yours sincerely, GILBERT MITHWAITE.QD AIR MINISTRY, F.Z. 2408/34. ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, ?.C. 8. 9th April 1934. (Part II). &lt;^7 My dear Laithwaite, Will you please refer to my letter of the 20th March 1934, on the subject of acquisition of certain additional facilities for aircraft in Koweit and to Political Agent Koweit's telegram of the 3rd instant in which he states that the Sheikh proposes to charge an annual rent of £1,200 for the quarantine site, previously referred to as site (a). 2. While we agree that the Sheikh's terms are probably not unreasonable and appreciate the fact that he wishes to help as far as he reasonably can, we regret that we do not feel justified in paying an annual rent of £1,200 perhaps for the next 80 years or more when there is no certainty that the site will eventually be required as a base to accommodate R.A.F. units. Also if that site should eventually be acquired by the oil company and we then find that a base is required in Koweit territory, it is possible that an alternative site could be obtained elsewhere, not necessarily so close to Koweit town. 3. It is perhaps a little unfortunate that after a certain amount of pressure had been brought to bear on the Sheikh to fix a rent which he would be prepared to accept, we should now decline his offer, but I fear this cannot be helped. Will you, therefore, please ask the Political Agent to decline the Sheikh's offer as far as the quarantine site is concerned and, if you think it desirable, explain the reasons for our decision. Laithwaite Esq., ^ -—4./ ndia Office, S. W. 1.2, 4. At the same time we shall 'be grateful if you will accept the Sheikh's offer to let us have the sites at Jahra and Subaihiya free of charge. We leave it to you to decide what form of agreement or exchange of letters is necessary to put the matter on a formal basis, but would, of course, like the concession to extend for the longest possible period of time. 5. The only outstanding matter then is the need for a flying boat anchorage opposite the quarantine site and we shall be obliged if you can arrange with the Sheikh for us ■,&lt; A.V.-K-V f;. ■ » W&gt;fr. .'.r,1, ^ |||uu | . T - | Vr —aty to be allowed to put down and maintain moorings there. V/e must, of course, accept the Sheikh's stipulation contained in Political Agent Koweit's telegram of the 27th February 1934, that the anchorage shall not be denied to local craft. 6. It is possible, of course, as we are not now taking up the quarantine site, that the oil company may do so and that they may develop a harbour tiere. In that event we may come up against the difficulty mentioned in your letter PtZ.1825/34, of the 19th March 1934, that Clause 8 of the Government Agreement provides that 'harbours developed by the company shall be under its complete and exclusive control'. 7. As we have been informed by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, that there is no suitable alternative anchorage ror flying boats, this is a serious difficulty. We would suggest, however, that if a claim is now staked which allows us to put down moorings opposite the quarantine site, we might be covered by the first part of Clause 8 of the Government Agreement. We would be glad to have your views on this point and would also welcome any other suggestions as to how our requirement for a flying boat anchorage can now be safeguarded, and in any case would like you to obtain the necessary authority to put down moorings near the quarantine site./site. Presumably the Sheikh would not make any charge for this concession. 8.

Yusuf Yasin approached me this morning. He said that no definite agreements had been reached with Ydlibi before the latter left on March 23rd. Financial terms offered by Ydlibi in connexion with neutral zone were as follows;- all being payments in gold to Saudi government and Sheikh jointly: oil in commercial quantities. Four shillings a ton Royalty thereafter. Loan of £50,000 on discovery of oil in commercial quantities and similar loan one year later. Yusuf Yasin said that Saudi government were communicating these proposals to Standard Oil Company of California in accordance with agreement with the latter. If the Standard Oil Company refused to offer similar terms government would pursue negotiations with Arabian .development Syndicate. He enquired whether in that case government should/ £20,000 down on grant of concession. £10,000 annual rent pending discovery ofshould approach His Majesty ! s Government or whether syndicate should do this or whether government or syndicate should approach Sheikh of Koweit. He also enquired whether if S.A. Company were prepared to grant terms offered by syndicate there would be any objection to grant of concession to S.A. Company. I adhered to formula in first paragraph of your telegram Ho, 31 but promised to report for instructions. Having regard to contents of your telegram under reference I feel the time has come to take if possible more positive line with Saudi government.

I note your views. V/e are sending copies of your letter to the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Koweit hy to-day's air mailj with the connected correspondence. 2. I doubt very much, on the otner hand, if there is any real prospect of advance on the lines suggested in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter. An alternative site, as suggested in paragraph 6, would, of course, meet the case. But your previous correspondence with the A»O.C. suggests that it will not he very easy to find one. 3. Would you like to consider the following suggestion? (I cannot of course say to what extent it would have any prospect of going down with the sheikh). Your position is that it is important (and may be very important) to secure site (a) or a corresponding site in .Koweit in view of possible ultimate developments in connection with Iraq or the 1 ike / Jommander W#A. McGlaughry, ,. t D.3.O., M*G., D*P.G., Air Ivan is try, Adastral House, Kingsway, W,G. 2.like, and it is of course generally accepted that the strategic- importance of Koweit is potentially very great. On the other hand, the possibility of development which would necessitate the use of such a site is remote; it may well he that we should never have to use it at all, and in any event it is unlikely that it will he necessary to use it for many years to come. In those circumstances you not unnaturally see objection to paying so substantial a sum as £1,200 a year (or even half that amount) for a site of which you would be making no use* It might conceivably be possible for Dickson, if Fowle agreed, to take the line with the Sheikh that, as he was aware, we were merely anxious to secure area (a) as an insurance area in view of the terms of tne Koweit Oil Company's concession and the possibility of difficulty later if we do not take the necessary precautions now^ that, on the other hand, there would be no question of our using this area, so far as we could at tne moment judge, for many years to come; that in these circumstances, while much appreciating the generous offer which had been made by the Sheikh, we were reluctant to incur expenditure on the scale suggested; but that His Excellency might be prepared to consider recognising the site in question as one reserved by us for air facilities within the terms of the Government mwOlHWI'VtMWwA'; v.)&gt;.■/■ &gt;vw... , , Agreement/Agreement with the Koweit Oil Company ; on the understanding that we should in fact take no action for some time to come to develop it, that if and when we did find it necessary (after reference to him) actively to develop the site, we would pay him £1,200 (or a smaller figure if you thought fit); hut that in the meantime, inasmuch as we should he paying merely for something which was only a reservation and did not involve any interference with the ordinary use of the site hy its present occupants, the sheikh, etc., we thought a nominal rent of some sort, say £100 a year, would prohahly meet the case. What would you think of action on these lines? We cannot, of course, say whether, even if the Resident thinks it sound, there would be any difficulty with the sheikh. But it seems at any rate an avenue worth exploring, and, as I have mentioned above, it does appear, though that is, of course, a matter entirely for you to Judge, to he prima facie of real importance to acquire rights over this site valid against the Koweit Oil Company.

I have the honour to report that I yesterday(23.4.34) T visited ' is Excellency the Shaikh, who is camped Y /ith his famil some miles south of Kuwait and after discussing certain preliminar/ies such as Bin Saud's campaign etc., and giving him a map of the Asir Yemen front which I had made for him, I decided that his 'mood' was entirely favourable to the business I had in hand, so I 'went ahead' and co:...unicatsd the contents of His liajesty's Secretary of State for India's telegram No.932, of 17th April last (practically word for word) I was not assisted by an interpreter, nor was anyone else present. 2. The Shaikh listened to what I had to say attentively, and throughout our subsequent conversation and discussion, . which lasted over l4~ ho a? l Ne sNowed reasonableness, shrewd sense and a keen desire t-© understand His Majesty 's G-overnment 1 point of view and to b® /i self understood. c) 3./- 2 - 3, As I had suspected to 'be tlie case, '' .tvrab riu.e :t , tliat stumbling block to so many people, seems to have been at the bottom of the 'Glauses ,r trouble, and the Shaikh appeared to me by no means as difficult or unreasonable as the local negotiators of the Kuwait Oil Company would seem to have given their London principals to understands This probably is due to the fact that neither of the Kuwait Oil Company negotiators knows ^abic and both have to rely on interpreters. 4. ./hen I had finished communicating what I had to say, the Shaikh began by quietly telling me that he had f elt very keenly the lack of consideration shorn him by the Kuwait Oil Company, in the natter of the introduction of articles HUxHd) incl SO. Messrs. Uhisholm and HQlmds # the Company* s local trusted Agents had apparently been sent out to negotiate the commercial Agreement , and had never been told there were other clauses to be Insertedj and that after he (the Shaikh) and the negotiators had gone through every clause of the Agreement time and again over a period of 48 days, and had , Company^ London principals write out and instruct their men to introduce two entirely new clauses, as a sort of after- thought and with the obvious intention of tying in some way or other to make the commercial Agreement appear subordinate to the Agreement which His Majesty's Government had made with the Company, v /hen it was quite obvious that it would always be' so subordinate. 5. As regards the late delivery of the Political Agreement (it had been promised him somewhere about the 15th February and had only been given on 12^pril) , the Shaikh said that he did not wish to say much, but he could not but feel that there was something behind the delay Y /hich savoured of keeping liim in the dark, x.ow that he had got it, however, he had no coinriients to make on ^he various articles, safe^uaios etc., which all seemed gpod.rv - o — 6. The Stiaikh thein. turned to points (a) ,yfb) and (c) of the secretary of states telegram under reference, and I give below and in seme detail his reactions. (a)Insertion of Articles lI(.i 3 .)Cd) and 20. The Shaikh said that he had nothing whatsoever to say against the Articles in themselves, but felt strongly that the insertion in his comriercial Agreement, v/hicli v /ould 01 c on::' ^ ';u oublishsci. , of any clauses ma kin mention of His IvIa .1estv T s Government by name. especially when such suggested that ultimate control of the concession lay with His Liajesty's Government, 7/ould gravely prejudice his good name and prestige in the eyes of fellow Arab Rulers, and would almost be interpreted as the signing away of his independence. Hor would His Majesty^ Governments good name for fair dealing esc pe criticism. He (the Shaikh) would become the laughing stock of Bin oaud and other$ who would say '^Brother AilSBd is not allowed to make even a simple commercial Agreement with a foreiga business firm, without the British stepping in and forcing him to insert certain by&gt;our leave clauses'^. He had no objection to His Majesty*s Government ^tying him up', as much as she chose, both in the -olitical Agreement or by other secret document. 7hat he feared was publicity of such control clauses. He had promised and would again promise to show the commercial Agreement as finally agreed upon between himself and the Kuwait Oil Company, to His Llajesty's Government, before he actually put his signature to it, therefore it seemed to him that His Majesty * s Government could -perfectly easily and definitely inaire that no offending clause, would get into the commercial Agreement, which would conflict in any way with their Political Agreement. Surely this was enou^i. He begged and trusted that ' is MajestyS Government would understand his standpoint, which was one affecting his 'Sharaf' (pride or honour) and which in no way affected his/8,/ cS» Ms loyalty, or his desire to please His Majesty l s Government. Cb)Local Representative. The negotiators had clearly misunderstood him, said the Shaikh, ii.ll that he had wished to insure (in making his verbal request to the negotiators) was that he should not 138 ' bidden rour::h shod aver ?7 (his words) and that a person who was ignorant of the Arabic language, or Arab Customs or was actually a persona non , :rata to himself, should not be appointed as the Company*s local Bepresentative. He merely desired that the selection of such local Representative should be made by His majesty's Government and the Company in full ccnsaltation with hinself , and that if he did not like a man or conversely liked a particular person, some notice should be taken of his wishes. This, said the ohaikh, was after all his undoubted ri ht as Ruler of the State and as the 'granter of the concession'. (c) Offer frcm another Gil Conpanv. The ohaikh admitted that he had received a telegram from London, purporting to come from an all British concern. The latter had asked permission to op01 negotiations, and offered over 5 lacs of rupees on his signing^as well as other equally favourable terms. He could not divulge name of Company even to me, but would say that he had replied that he could not consider the the offer unless negotiations with the Kuwait Oil Company showed signs of breaking down altogether. hi • • '• • ■ ■ v&lt; 7, The Shaikh again and again reiterated that he was most anxious to come to terms with the Kuwait Oil Com pany, as he knew this would please His i.Iajesty*s Government and give them satisfaction, but the Kuwait Oil Company should be told by someone ^not to conduct their negotiations (as they were doing) on the assumption that ?t tliey had eliminated all competitors frcm the field through beinp. suj . or t e d by .1 s Lla i e s ty * s G-ov e imiont ; ' (his words).- 5 - /' Cd 8» The ohailda vvent on to say that unless the ICuY/ait Oil Company hurried up and settled matters, other companies v /ould clearly very shortly be coming along as competitors, all with good British credentials# 9# The Shaikh finally assured me that he perfectly well understood that only an all British or a 50/50 British Company would be allowed by His Majesty's Government to compete for the Kuwait Oil Concession, and said that the standard Oil Oompany of California were out of the picture altogether and that I need not fear them, 10 ♦ Before leaving, I asked the ,.haikh if he could not possibly as a personal favour to me and because he knew I wished him well, agree to the insertion of Article llU)(d) and 20 / or at least one of them. 1 (rather unfairly perhaps) stressed the fact that by doing so, he would be winning His I.Iajesty T s Governments entire approbation# The Shaikh in reply and with some emotion said he could not,and would prefer to have no Oil Concession at all than act against his own and his family's interests# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, r Lt,-Colonel, P olit ical .a.gent, ICuwait # ^ ^ ^ M - 4 ATelegram XX Prom PoxLitical Resident, Bus hi re# Secretary of State for India, London, Repeated to Political Agent, Kuwait.

He reaffirmed strong desire of King to see Neutral Zone concession given to British, whom he would have preferred in Hasa also. He gave me an entirely new version of option given to Standard Oil Company of California. Clause did not promise them preference on equal terms in respect of concession 'by Saudi Government as regards share of latter. It contemplated two alternatives as follows: (a) if Shaikh gives concession as regards his share to any one Saudi Government would ?give preference as regards their*3 to California on same terms; (h) Saudi Government wouM arrange with Shaikh tenns of joint con cession to Standard Oil Company. I understand Puad^ view to he that right of preference under (a) was absolute, i.e. matter would he finished hy acceptance or rejection hy Standard Oil Company of California of terms agreed between other party and Shaikh. He admitted that if Standard. Oil Company accepted thetV concession could not 'be exploited unless concession aires came to tems 'but said that Saudi Government coulfl force Standard Oil Company to pariidipate ?with British Company. He hinted at possihility that if all else failed Neutral/-2- Heutral Zone might have t o 'be divided between Hulers 'but I could not judge how serious this v;as. He made light of question of administrative arrangements in zone lout made no positive suggestion. ]?uad 'begged me to treat his statement as highly confidential. He promised to send me text of optional clause in Standard Oil Company * s agreement. This may elucidate obscurities in above statement. I believe truth is that Government and Standard Oil Company are in disagreement as to effect of clause. According to Awayni Arabian Bevelopment Syndicate are determined not to combine with Standard Oil Company and Government wrote some letter to latter about arbitration which required answer within 30 days. - RYAH - (Copy forwarded under ^.L.Ho.43S!-S of 3/5/34 to; 1.

P., I note that Shaikh appears to have no objection at all to provisions of political agreement which all seem good to him. In effect this agreement merely contains (a) certain safeguards of position of His Majesty's Grdvern- ment (general scheme of -which is similar to those contained in agreement of June 12th 1930 between Shaikh of Bahrain and Eastern and General Syndicate) and (b) certain additional safeguards» Reason ? why Shaikh objects to olaimo 11 A (d) and 20 of Conmerclal agreement becauPe 156^6 they refer to an agreement between Company and His Majesty's Gov e mm en t, terms of which will not be known and may therefore be erroneously supposed by his fellow Arab Rulers to be prejudicial to his independence, I agree that there is something to be said for this point of vi ew, 3. I agree that Dickson should aTcoroach Shaikh with suggestion that difficulty should be overcome by insertion which you propose in each Article or by insertion of words 'in which agreement Shaikh has expressed his, concurrence' if Shaikh should prefer this wording. It might/@) -2- mlght also te arranged to exchange letters with Shaikh in which he said either that he has no objection to or that he concurs in arrangement 'between Company and His Majesty^ Gove^ment and if necessaiy to publish letters ('but without text of agreement) if this procedure would ease matters with Shaikh as a method of making it clear that he is a consenting party to that agreement. 4. If it is found possible to find a solution difficult on above lines then in the last resort I should be willing that clauses 11 A (d) and 20 should be taken out of existing draft commercial agreement and made subject c&amp;f a separate agreement between the Shaikh and Company in which His Majesty's Grovemment through Political Hesldent could if necessary be joined and which would be kept entirely confidential# r liis would, involve some consequential amendments of Clause 11 A in existing draft 4 by omission of 'only' after ♦♦three following cases' and of 'and in, no ether' after 'the above mentioned cases'. If this solution is adopted terms of such separate confidential agreement could be settled in consultation with Company here and telegraphed to you with a view to its conclusion at Kuwai t• 5. As regards Shaikh's difficulty about Chief Local Representative please confirm whether Shaikh is content with an assurance 'that His Majesty's Government will be glad to give him advance Information of any appointment so that he will have opportunities of offering any comments upon it'. If this formula i s no t sufficient I am willing that he should be assured that before approving an appointment His Majesty's Goyerment will inform him in advance and give full weight to his wishes. In dealing with/d ■with this subject Dickson may find^useful to refer to analogy of Bahrain agreement quoted ahove which provides that appointment of Chief Local Representative shall 'be approved 'by His Majesty^ Crovernment without making any reference to consultation with Shaikh. 6. In his reference to other possible British competitors Shaikh appears either to be bluffing or to be misinformed. 'Ve know of no other pure or 50% British Company willing and able to give terms offered by Kuwait Oil Companjr^ 7» Tie Company have been Informed that I am telegraphing in the sense of preceding paragraphs and they are instructing Chisholm to resume negotiations at once on outstanding points in commercial agreement. 8. For your confidential information it is desir&amp;ble that negotiations should be concluded as soon as possible because A.P.G.G. are anxious to get them out of f way before approaching Shaikh on behalf of I.P*G. with a view to obtaining from him (so far as he is concerned) an option on concession for Kuwait Neutral Zone. - SECHETfARY OF STATE FOR INDIA-Telegram XX. iProm Political Agent, Kuwait.

That they must obtain telegraphic instructions from their Lonflon principals as to whether his terms are acceptable or not as further delay is useless. 2. I take serious view of letter and think Shaikh may break off negotiations unless something is done by London quickly to relieve situation. It seems alear now that Secretary h ; of State* s telegram i^o. 962 greatly disturbed Shaikh who is still further irritated by latest instructions * regarding neutral zone delivered by me on April 28th as seeming to doubt his previous assurances. 4.

In a conversation which I had with H.E. the Shaikh today (3*5.34), he (the Shaikh) referred to the above letter and enquired rather impatiently why it was that His Majesty t s Government of late did not seem to trust him quite as freely as they had done heretofore. He added that he thought it strange that in a matter concerning which he had on several occasions given verbal and categorical assurances, to both the Hon'ble the Political Resident and myself, he efeoi should n6w be asked to do so by written document. 3. I did my best to placate His Excellency, but I could see that he was not a little irritated, I may add^hat one of the commonest expressions he uses with me in our various discussions is 'My word is my bond and as good as my signature', so possibly this had something to do with his hurt feelings, but I am inclined to think that the delivery of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India's message (contained in his telegram No.963, dated 17th17til April 1934) was the root cause of the trouble* That telegram I know now disturbed His Sxcellency a great deal I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, &lt; jf 'vV 0 w . - 'Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait,- g - : o &amp; j* x S [ )b&gt;)l &lt;■■'xt^u*- ^W ii jy&gt;%»JL # jL-W j\ ^1 j L. j o' i yry\'Cr* * — ^-jiS^i \y**r ^ i—■■^J I ii. inU^J J ijry**** i—.n^wi* I ♦ ij&gt;L---^&gt;Jl AV J1—ft.** Li 5j ,1 Sjr^ g^ o^yr u^ &lt; ^ 15w.^ ci'l ^j—^ •* L-*-^ &lt;&gt;« U* jl^jl iLlJufW^j J l^«l «*• • /oil a; VI pi/U- ii ^U J ^fA-. ly^ j '*^l 1 1 K 2.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram No»162 of 3rd May, I have the honour to enclose translation of Letter No.KH/3/1283, dated 17th Muharram 1353 (1st May 1934} from H.S. the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Kuwait Oil Company. 2„ Messrs Holmes and Chisholm (the latter of whom was absent in Basra on 1st May) visited me on 2nd May, and reported the receipt of the above letter and also furnished me with a translation* Both appeared seriously concerned at what they considered to be more or less 'an ultimatum',. 3, At a subsequent discussion which I had with the above two gentlemen. Major Holmes expressed the opinion that the Shaikh was being pressed flcfeman outside quarter, and so had decided to force an early issue with the Kuwait Oil Company. He mentioned that he had inner information that the Shaikh had received two further telegrams from the strange company whom he suspfected to be the B.O.D. This may or may not be true. 4. Major Holmes added that what worried him at this stage most of all, was the new attitude of the Shaikh. The latter, he said, had always in the past been on the most intimate and friendly terms with himself (Major Holmes), but that quite recently he seemed to have changed entirely, and to be no longer desirous of trusting him or having any direct dealings with him.- 2 - 5. Both Major Holmes and ICr.Chisliolm ccmplained that their principals at Home appeared to have no conception of the difficult atmosphere out here in Kuwait and still less of the suspicious mental '♦make up n of the Shaikh, and by their refusal to face facts were going out of their way to endanger the whole success of the negotiations* Thier latest request to be allwed to proceed to London and explain the seriousness of the situation out here, had been, they said, turned down» As far as one could gather from the talk of these two gentlemen, they appeared to feel that their hands were being unnecessarily tied by their directors at Home, who were not in touch with facts nor could keep pace with an ever changing situation. This of course was all said in confidence» 6. As I have already said in my telegram under refer ence, I take a serious view of the Shaikh^s letter and the situation generally, which seems to have taken a turn for the worse in the last week* In my opinion unless the Kuwait Oil Company walk very warily, I should not be sur prised if the Shaikh were to break off negotiations* 7. I am pretty sure in my own mind now, that His Majesty's Government's message re Clauses 11 A(d) and 20 of the draft Commercial Agreement, which I was ordered to deliver had a most unfortunate effect of the Shaikh s mind* He became furiously suspicious, and from a subsequent con versation which T had with him he seems to have got it into his head that h^Ls in process of being bullied by a com bination of the Kuwait Oil Company in London and His Majesty § G-overnment, and he probably is determined in his own mind not to submit to further pressure* The trouble is that we are once again up against Arab pride, and a false move K may easily cause the Shaikh / decide to break with the Kuwait Oil Company for good* I have/TRANSLATION.

Shaikh has suggested as alternative that he should receive confid ential letter from Political Agent embodying clauses 11 (A) (d) and 20, a copy of which could be given to Company. 3. I have prepared draft with Dickson which repeats verbatim clauses in question, with the addition, which the Shaikh asked for, of Article 12 (B) (a) from 'all lands granted' down to 'good order and repair' prefaced by the words 'It is understood that in the event of the Agreement between Your Excellency and the Company being terminated thereby.' 4, Draft ends with two additional paragraph -s, one of which alludes to the fact that the Shaikh has agreed verbally to the contents of the letter and asks for written confirmation from him and the other refers to the fact that His M^esty's Government can give a copy confidentially to the Company. 5 # Shaikh has verbally agreed to draft though as I explained tohim I can in no way guarantee that His Majesty^ Government will accept his alternative -te binding effect on the Company personally I am in Provided that the letter has the requisiI am in favour of it since it seems to all intents and purposes to be the same as the separate confidential agreement suggested in your paragraph 4, and since the Shaikh exhibited considerable opposition to the alternative proposed* ?• Your paragraph 5.

I understood from paragraph 6 of Dickson's Express Letter of April 24th that Shaikh merely feared effect of publicity. Alternatives in my telegram Ho»1072 were designed to meet this objection which I should have thought would be entirely overcome at any rate by alternative in paragraph 4 of that telegram since separate agreement there suggested would be kept entirely secret. I should be glad if you could telegraph more fully Shaikh's present attitude if he has shifted his ground. 2. Shaikh may be under some misapprehension as to clause 20, purpose of which is merely to remove technical inconsistencies between commercial and political agreements. For example clauses 14, 8, 5, (a) and 5(b) of original draft commercial agreement are affected by Articles 2, 3 (second sub-paragraph) 6 and 7 respectively of political agreement. Last two cases provided addition al safeguards to Shaikh. 3. Clause 11 A (d) gives Shaikh power to terminate agreement in circumstances not otherwise provided. /provided. It is clear that this would fall to the ground unless agreed to in some form by Company. 4 # Alternative procedure now suggested by Shaikh does not seem adequate as suggestion stands since letter from Political Agent would clearly not bind Company. If however Shaikh prefers that control clauses should be covered by exchange of letters instead of by separate agreement we might consider adopting following procedure. Company to address to Shaikh and Political Resident I identical letters on lines which you have drafted intimating Company^ acceptance of clauses. Shaikh would acknowledge Company^ letter and inform Political Resident that he had done so stating if possible at the same time that he has cognisance of and has concurred in Political agreement. 5, I have not yet put this suggestion to Company nor consulted other departments concerned but should be glad if you would telegraph at once whether you think it would meet case if we were prepared to adopt it. 6. As regards Chief Local Representative I hope Shaikh will agree to one of the formulas suggested in para graph 5 of my telegram 1172 or some similar formula.

Yours sincerely, J # Gr .LA ITHWAITE .Note by Le^al Adviser, India Office, dated 12th April t 19o4 Hie primary subject matter of Clause 8 is sites - meaning apparently land sites - which have been selected 'by His Majesty's G-overnment for defence purposes or under heads specified in Clause 8. A flying boat achorage with moorings in the sea off this quarantine site (which I take it is in a harbour) would presumably come under the 'development of harbours' just as much as e.g. building jetties or buoying a deep-water channel. The clause contemplates the development of harbours (a) by His Majesty's Government with a proviso in favour of the Company in certain events; (b) by the Company in which case their control is complete and exclusive. The Company could not therefore object to His Majesty's Government under the Sheikh's authority putting down moorings, either now or later (now for choice). This does not get rid of the proviso to (a) above but seems preferable to allowing the situation in (b) to arise. If the sites contemplated by Clause 8 are not necessarily land sites, but might also include sea site3;, it does not seem to lead to any useful conclusion in the present case to suggest that a demarcated area in the sea selected for seaplane moorings may itself be a site, because so long as it is in a harbour the proviso under Clause 8 would attach. On the question of the land site, it may be worth consideration whether, although acquisition of the particular site has, as regards the Sheikh, been refused for the present, it may still be open to His Majesty's Government, as between the Company and His Majesty's Government/2. Government under the present agreement, to say to the Company that the site has been selected. The contention seems a fair one that selection doee not necessarily involve actual or immediate acquisition and taking over possession. Of course the Sheikh might not lilte this, if it came to his ears, and the suggestion has its perils inasmuch as in Clause 8 the expression is used for both parties and if we used it now the Company could certainly claim the same construction if it suited them.o By Air Mail S.Z .AlT.f. /17 APH IS54 Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office 0 India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.I.

FINAL RECORD A meeting took place at the India Office on 17tli April with representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company to discuss the present position of the Company's negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait. Present: Sir Louis Kershaw Mr. F.G.Starling Mr. J.G.Laithwaite Mr. G.E. Crombie Mr. Stevens Mr. Lefroy (in the Chair) Petroleum Department India Office. Kuwait Oil Company. Mr. Stevens produced a telegram which the Company had received from their negotiators in Kuwait (copy attached). The Shaikh had objected to the clauses in the conmercial agreement which referred to the agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government viz. Article 11 A (d) (providing for cancellation in the event of the Company failing to carry out the terms of the Government Agreement) and Article 20 (providing that the commercial agreement should be subordinate to and controlled by the terms of the Government agreement) on the ground that the .commercial agreement was separate from the Government agreement and that these clauses were therefore unnecessary. Mr. Stevens suggested that the difficulty might be got over if these two clauses were covered .in an agreement betfreen the Company and His Majesty's Government but Sir Louis Kershaw explained that since His Majesty's Government were not parties to the commercial agreement these sanctions must appear in that agreement. He proposed however that the India Office should send instructions for the Political Agent to explain to the /the Shailih the purpose of the Government agreement ? point, out that the clauses in question were in the Shaikh's own interest and inform him that His Majesty's Government would insist on similar clauses in any concession which might 'be granted hy the Shaikh to any Company. With reference to the Shaikh's economic demands it was explained that these, were a matter 'between the Shaikh and the Company and'that His Majesty's Government were not interested. Mr. Stevens said that' as regards financial terms the Shaikh and the Company were not now very far apart. Mr* Stevens was disturbed 'by the reference in the telegram from Kuwait to an offer having 'been made to the Shaikh 'by a '100^ British Company''. Mr. Starling did not think that the British Oil Development Company., the British interest in which was about 51 per cent, could be interested in obtaining a concession in Kuwait. It was possible, however ? that if the British Oil Development were inplicated in the matter the Shaikh might have been misled by the name of the Company into thinking that it was 100 per cent. British, The possibility was discussed of the Eastern and General or the Arabian Oil Development Syndicates having made some offer to the Shaikh. Mrs. Stevens said that he felt satisfied that there was no risk of this. Sir Louis Kershaw said that His Majesty's Government had no information of any such offer being made to the Shaikh by any Company other than the Kuwait Oil Company, He assured Mr, Stevens that the. consent of His Majesty's Government.would be necessary for the grant of a concession by the Shaikh to ar^j Company whatever its nationality. There was ? however, no objection to the Political Agent being instructed to remind the /3. the Shaikh of this, Mr« Steyens said that the Shaikh had asked for a Director on the Board of the Kuwait Oil Company in London. He saw great ohjeotion to this proposal since, in view of the 50/50 composition of the Board it would give the Shaikh's Director a deciding voice. Stevens referred to a suggestion vhich had already been mentioned to Mr. Walton hy Mr. Kemp of the Anglo Persian Oil Company that the Shaikh might he invited to pay a visit to this country as the guest of the Kuwait Oil Company. Mr. Stevens was himself of opinion., with which Sir Louis Kershaw agreed, that the Kuwait Oil Company would 'be going outside their proper sphere in making such an invitation to the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite added that an invitation to the Shaikh of Kuwait might embarrass His Majesty's Government 'by encouraging the other Shaikhs to expect similar invitations. Mr» Stevens said that the 'best solution would probably be to offer the £ -ikL a lump sum representing the cost of a visit and leave it to him to do as he thought fit. In answer to an enquiry from Sir Louis Kershaw about the 'textual alterations' in the commercial agreement referred to in the Company's telegram from Kuwait, Mr. Stevens promised that when these changes, which were of minor importance, had been finally agreed the agreement would be submitted again to His Majesty's Government for approval, Mr. Stevens said that the Shaikh was now asking that the Chief Local Representative should be a British subject appointed for five years after consultation with and subject to the approval of the Shaikh himself, whereas in the Company's agreement with His Majesty's Government it was laid down that the appointmont should be subject to the approval of the latter. Sir/4 - Sir Louis Kershaw said that this was a matter on which His Majesty's Government could not give way. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that in the Bahrein agreement the Shaikh had no rights of approval or dismissal of the Chief Local Representative. Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that the position might be eased if the Political Agent were instructed to tell the Shaikh that while His Majesty's Government could not admit any right of approval or disapproval on his part they would, as a matter of courtesy inform him in advance of any appointment to the post of Chief Local Representative, so that he might have an opportunity to make any comments. Sir Louis Kershaw said that he did not like the suggestion made in the telegram that the discussions with the Shaikh'might 'be postponed for two or three months. Mr. Stevens also did not favour this suggestion. It was agreed that thePompany should wait and see the effect of the l • _ telegram from the India Office instructing the Political Agent to intervene in the discussions. The conclusion of the meeting was that the India Office should at once telegraph to the Political Resident 1 on the lines of the telegram Wo, Z- dated of which a copy is attached. It was agreed that the Company might inform their negotiators of the instructions which were being sent to the Political Agent.P.Z.2716/34o TMim QFPICE , nOMFIDENTIAL . NOTE OF CONVEi^SATION WITH MR, LEffHOY OF IHS A NGLO-FZR3XAN OIL GOKPA^Y ON EOth A i ^^TL 1954, HEGARDING THE KOl^IT N5UTRAJ, 70NE . Mr, Lefroy of the A«P»0#C, called dh Friday, 20th April, to give the latest info mat ion in connection with the 1.P.G.'s desire to secure a concession in the Ko we it Neutral Zone. 2. He said that in accordance with the understanding reached the I»F«C. had estaolisned contact unofficially wi1»h Mr. Janson of the ^rahian Development syndicate. Tne Syndicate nad expressed theiiiselves ci.s optiuiistic and nad made it clear that they were most anxious not to dispose, of any concession they might secure to American interests and would very greatly prefer to dispose of it to the A.P#O.C. The latter, without taking matters further with the Syndicate, had pursued independent enquiries as to the position as between the Standard Oil of California and Ihn Saua in tne matter. Tne result of these enquiries had, in the first place, heen to confirm the information already in our possession, that Ton Saud had committed himself to biving the standard Oil an opportunity to compete with any terms which the Arabian Development syndicate, might offer for Ion Saud's interest in a concession in the Neutral zone. But they were still in the dark as to the precise nature of the option. They had, however, also obtained information, from a source which they regarded as entirely reliable, that there was in existence a second option and that Ibn Saud had undertaken to accept any terms which tne S t andard Oil might be able to persuade the sheikh of Ko we it to accept in respect of the Neutral Zone. Their source was such aS'in their/- 2 - their view to put the correctness of this iniormation teyond a douht. Having regard to it they saw no point in carrying matters furtner with the Arabian Development Syndicate, since it was clear that, given the two conmitments referred to aoove, that syndicate would never be in a position to deliver the goods. 3. Mr. Lefroy said that in these circumstances his principals were of opinion that the only course to take was to malt the conclusion of negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit ahout the Koweit oil concession and immediately on trie completion of those negotiations to send Mr. Longrigg or other representative of the Company to Koweit to endeavour to secure from the sheikh an option on the Koweit Neutral Zone. The Company had recalled Mr. Longrigg from Iraq, had discussed the matter with him, and had now sent him hack to his post. No time would he lost once the main Koweit concession was out of the way. 4. I told Mr. Lefroy that I would let the interested Departments know what he had reported and that he might assume, unless he heard to the contrary, that we agreed with his view that, in the circumstances he described and on the assumption that his principals were satisfied as to the correctness of their information, the course he suggested was probably the only one open. 5. Mr. Lefroy subsequently enquired on the telephone whether he was correct in assuming that there would be no question of a Government agreement in the case of the Neutral zone. I said that there would certainly be a Government agreement and that it had, I thought, been made clear in earlier discussions at which Mr. ^efroy had not/not 'been pre sent ? that in view o£ the very special circumstances presented, ty the Kovveit Neutral Zone, the safeguards embodied in such an agreement would prohahly te distinctly more stringent than those which had heen imposed in the case oX Koweit itself. 6. On a minor point it may he of interest to record that Mr. Lefroy emphasised that the were most anxious to give no information to Mr. Stevens or other iynerican interests of the position in regard to the Neutral Zone, y/nile American companies might compete against one another any information given in this area to .American nationals appeared to tie passed on. He was anxious, therefore, that if no objection was seen, we should avoid any reference to or discussion of the Neutral Zone in Mr. Stevens' presence. Asked to give any information as to the progress of the Koweit negotiations, he said that notning. material had yet come m. On the question of money the Company had gone far to meet the Sheikh. He had originally asked for 5 lakhs cash down. The Company had now offered Bs.450,000, and the Sheikh was asking for ills. 475,000. J.G. LAIIHWAITE. ^4th April 1934.P.Z.

The telegram seems to us to make it clear that Ibn Saud has committed himself very far to the Standard Oil as regards any concession in this area and that in these circumstances there is no real advantage in pursuing matters through Ydlibi. On the whole we therefore think that the best course would probably be that suggested by Lefroy in his conversation with me on the 20th April, a note ol v/hich went to you and the other departments under our printed I y)fletter P .Z. 2716/34, of 26th April, viz: that once the Koweit Oil negotiations are over, the Iraq.

The Iraq Petroleum Company and the California Oil would hare to get together and agree amongst themselves that proTided no third competitor entered the field for the iione say for the space of two years, (which could be ensured by His Majesty^ Government exercising their veto on the Shaikh), neither party would compete for the &lt;«one» This would effectively sterilise this area. This sterilization I imagine might suit the Iraq Petroleum Company as well as both the California Oil and the Kuwait Oil Company. It is quite on the cards that neither of these latter Companies will find oil in their respective areas, i.e. Hasa and Kuwait, and if this is the case I do not imagine that there will be much competition for the small zone in between• 2. Of course the sterilization would not suit Bin Saud or the Shaikh, but as it would only be for a period of a couple of years I think that their complaints could be resisted* 3./ J•G.Laithwaite iSsquire.

Neither Ydlibi nor Awayni have been so positive here. Position is probably as stated in last paragraph of my telegram 94. 4.

For these and other reasons I prefer to pursue matter with Fuad orally. Unexpected opportunity of doing this now arises and I may have to take advantage of it tomorrow though I will try and postpone conversation until 7 /ednesday. My only difficulty is that it will be inferred that if replies confirm Ydlibi*s statements His Majesty's Government will be prepared to support Syndicate with Shaikh of Kuwait whereas correspondence ending with India Office telegram 1308 to Political Resident/'2- Resident suggests contrary intention.

I saw the Shaikh this morning, and approached him on lines proposed in paras. 3 and 4 of Secretary of State for Indian telegram No. 1321 of May 19th (showing him relevant extracts in English and Arabic to make my points). 3. The Shaikh at first took up his old stand about himself having the right to designate the Chief Local Representative in the first place, and His Majesty's G-overnment having the right to veto his selection, and he pressed me to say why His Majesty's Government concerned themselves when clearly the matter was one between himself and the Company alone. 4. In reply I showed hi i para 4 (in English and Arabic) of the Political Agreement, the wording of which clearly required the Company to designate the Chief Local Representative themselves, and get the approval of His Majesty's Government afterwards. I pointed out that Article 4 made it impossible for either the Company or His Majesty's Government to permit him (the Shaikh) to designate the Chief Local Representative himself. 5. My argument seemed at long last to impress the Shaikh (who I really do not think has ever properly read'*3 - 2 - read the Political Agreemsnt) for after some further arguments he proposed the following 'formula' or 'doorway' as he called it, for settling the matter to the satisfaction of His Majesty's Government and the Company: (a) The Company's Hepresentatires to visit him and show him para 4 of the Political Agreement, confidential copies of which they and he already pos sessecU (b) The Company's Represents tires, next to inform | him that it quite impossible for them to agree to his (Shaikh's) selecting the Chief Local --.epresentatiTe, as he apparently wished to do, as such action would be tantamount to their breaking their Agreement with His Majesty's Government of March 5th. (c) His Excellency (the Shaikh) would see and agree to this, and both he and the Company's Representatives would then set to m^rk to draw up a formula based on Article 4 of the Political Agreement, or possibly in almost the same words, ■ior insertion as Article 6 (A) of the Commercial Agreement. 6. The Shaikh himself pointed out that he had already officially intimated his approval of the Political Agreement, and ipso facto of Article 4 to me in writing on 13th April 1954, so could use this fact as a 'face saver' with the Company's Representatives, 7. As the Shaikh has also signified his approval of the contents of the draft letter (especially para 3(b)i, sent out under Secretary of State for India's telegram ^0.1322 of 19th May, later delivered to the Shaikh officially by me, (See my telegram No. 195 of 28th Hay) it seems to me that the question of the Chief Local representative has practically settled itself, and that- 3 - a nd that the Shaikh also now appreciates this. 8. -or iormalities* sake however he would like the Company's representatives (negotiators) to face him with para 4 of the Political Agreement, as suggested by him above, so that he can withdraw from his former position in graceful manner under some such excuse as 'If you had showed me this para before and pointed out your awkward predicament, I, of course, would not have taken the tLlne I did'. It is once again, I fear a case of pride and 'Amour propre' with him. 9. Though the Shaikh's plan is somewhat cumbersome, I suggest it be acted upon, especially as i t comes from him, and promises success. I suggest therefore that the Company's representatives (Holmes and Chisholm) be immediately told to go ahead on the lines proposed. I could do this myself if you see no objection. 10. It is necessary that we should act quickly, I think, as the Shaikh told me that he definitely proposed infoiming Holmes and Ghisholm on Saturday 2nd June that unless they could agree to his Commercial terms within the next 10 days, he did not want to see them again till the end of the hot weather, and that the best thing thqy could do was to go home to London and report the situation. (I see Holmes' hand in this), and on the excuse that the weather was too hot for work, he (the Shaikh) would 'give them his word' not to listen to any other competitors until they returned in the Autumn.

I I told Fuad this A.M. that Ydlibi had approached His Majesty's Government who had not decided on their attitude towards Syndicate but whose reply to them would probably be affected by truth or otherwise of Ydlibi's statements in paragraphs 1 and 3 of your tele- 7/0 gram No«108. % Fuad denied definite commitment to Ydlibi but under close questioning admitted that if Ydlibi squared Shaikh of Kuwait and if Americans were eliminated, Saudi Government 'would be willing' to participate in grant of concession to Syndicate. Americans were not however by any means out of the field and retained rights under Article quoted in my telegram llo«95^^ 7 Puad explained confidentially that ^dlibi might have been genuinely misled into regarding second point. During his own absence at ABHA Saudi Government had been under the impression that they could discharge their obligation to Americans in the manner described in paragraph 2 of my telegram No.51 and had written them as foreshadowed by YASIM. Letter had however to be with drawn as it rested on an untenable interpretation of | A* V opti onal clauses. rr Y/hether misinterpretation was deliberate or ■■ not there is little doubt that Saudi Government now recognise/recognise that they are committed to Americans and realise danger ? it carries. Fuad today took line that question of who got concession was less important in eyes of his Government than that of concession being granted by agreement to some party who would exploit it. He suggested combination of interests and referred to that which had produced Kuwait Oil Company. I think personally that there is much to be said for this but I do not see how Standard Oil Company of California could be kept out if they should insist on coming in. I impressed Puad with importance of considera tion in second sentence of paragraph 4 of your telegram 108. He professed to appreciate it and said that his Government would welcome suggestions by His Majesty's Government. His line throughout was that Saudi Government wanted practical solution in good agreement with His Majesty^ Goverament. I cannot judge how far his views are those of King and his other Advisers but he seemed straight forward and confident that his appreciation of legal position was correct. He did not present appearance of being influenced by partiality for Ydlibi despite his interest with Awayni in whose affairs he may indeed have some commercial interest.

The confidential letter would I textually embody Clauses llA(d) and 20 of the Commercial Agreement and would in addition contain Clause 12B(a) of that Agreement from 'all land granted' down to 'good ■ order and repair', prefaced oy the words 'It is understood ItiBt in the event of tne agreement 'between Your Excellency's Government and the Company being terminated thereby'. (As we understand it, the, object of the proposed inclusion ■of this portion of Clause 123(a) is to cover the position loi the lands, buildings and other immovable property of jthe Company in the event of the determination of the l%reeffient under the provisions of Clause ll^(d).) The letter would further allude to the fact toxt the Sheikh pad aareed verbally to its contents and ask for written jconfirmation of this, and would refer to the fact that I it was open to His ivjajesty' s Government to give a copy I confidentially to the Company. His Majesty's Government are anxious so far as POsoicle to meet the Sheikh and as nothing is involved in I ne substance of the proposed exenange of letters in Bpich 'tt 1 ® Company have not already expressed their incurrence, they assume that the Company for their part wl ll see no difficulty in concurring In it. On the other as will be observed, the mere despatch by tne ^itlcal iigent to the sheikh of a letter such as His/- 5 - 5/ His Excellency su^gest/S.j a copy 01 wxiicn would, subsequently db corniiiujfiicci't'eci 'to 'tlie CoiTip&amp;ny 9 v/ould. ncti I necessarily 'binci t;h6 Compsxiyj cirid His Majest/y 1 s Government cire naturcilly anxious to nave tiiis point covered beyona question» 4.

Your Excellency also referred to the fact that an agreement, of which I attach a copy and in the terms of which you have concurred , to see no objection has heen concluded between the Kuwait Oil Company and H#M.G&gt; We have discussed what would happen in the following events should you decide to grant a concession to the KUw&amp;it Oil Company (a) if the Kuwait Oil Company shall fail to observe any of the terms of the agreement between the Company and H.ivUG.. signed in London on the 5th March 1934, referred to above, and if the matter is referred to arbitration unaer Article 18 of the commercial agreement with Your Excellency referred to above, fail to remedy such failure within the reasonable time which shall be fixed by the arbitrators for so aoing.

Your Excellency has also invited me to say what the position will be in the event of the agreement between Your Excellency ana the Company being terminated in the circumstances described in (a) above, in regara to the land granted to the Company by the sheikh and any lanas or builaings which the Company may have bought, and any houses or buildings constructed by, and other immovable property of, the Company within the state of Koweit. In reply I have to inform you that in such circumstanoss the/3. the Company agree that such lands, hulldings, houses ana other Irniiovahle property will he handed over to the Sheikh free of cost, and that producing wells and 'borings will he hanaed over in reasonably ^ooa oraer and repair. Your Excellency has intimated, after discussion with me, that you understand the nature of the arrangements as set out ahove, ana that you are prepared to agree to them. I now request that Your Excellency will be good enough to confirm this in writing.

I have not mentioned in the record of the interview that Janson also mentioned casually that the concession had been offered by the Arabian Development I 1 ''■■■'■ ■ ^ Illlk . Syndicate to the Iraq Petroleum Company, I have been in touch on this point with Lefroy, who assures me that, so far as the I .P ,G» are concerned, there has been no change in the situation in regard to the neutral sone since his interview with me on EOth April, of which copies were circulated under K our printed letter, £716/34 of 35th April, and that there has been no recent approach by Janson to the l.P.C, Janson*s statement, so far as there is any basis for it, is therefore, presumably, a reference to the unofficial contact established with the Arabian Development Syndicate by the I.P.C, and referred to in paragraph 2 of the note of the interview on 20th April referred to above. As you will see, Janson and Tdlibi took the line tliat the imericans were out of the picture so far as the neutral aone was concerned. Lefroy^ latest information is to the effect that the Americans are still eenly interested in the aeutral aone, and regard Ibn Saud as deeply committed to them in respect of it. Before we proceed further with the Arabian development Syndicate 1 s application, we should like to suggest for your consideration that it might be well at |fe? er » Esq., ten OKfiCK, m 11 &amp;♦W.1, (Si) s,...l.

Mr. Janson had asked to come and see me accompanied by Mr. Ydliloi to discuss the Neutral Zone. 2. On arrival he said that as we were aware his Corporation had 'been in negotiation for a concession in respect of the 'I '' ■|--|-- r • w '-''''mnr H i ^ I I _ ■ 1 Koweit Neutral Zone v^rith King Ihn Saud. He had seen me previously on this subject and had also kept Mr. Farrer of the Department of Overseas Trade in touch, Ihn Saud had now granted a concession to the Company and they were anxious to pursue matters with the Sheikh of Koweit. They wished for advice as to how this should he done. I invited the Company to let me see the terms of Ibn Saud's confirmation. They replied 'by shov/ing me the letter from the Saudi Minister of Finance^ of which, a copy is attached to this record. On its 'being pointed out to them that neither the letter nor the statements'in the Mote (also attached) by Mr. Auwaynee appeared in any way to commit the Saudi Government to the grant of the Concession, they said that the Saudi Government, as explained by Mr. Auwaynee in his note, saw difficulty in giving any formal consent until the Sheikh of Koweit had been approached and had agreed so far as he was concerned. They were, hoYiever, entirely satisfied that Ibn Saud l s word was as good as his band and that the reasons of the Saudi Government for not committing/&lt;273) 2. committing themselves in writing were merely technical in character. 4, I enquired what financial terms the Company had given Ibn Sand and was informed that they proposed to give him a lump sum of £10,000 down, and a royalty of agKdHniijanMiiMi 1 miKiii'WwiniSBt r 4/- per ton. Similar terms would be given to the Sheikh of Koweit, neither party 'being treated 'better than the other, 5, I said that Mr, Auwaynee's note referred to .American competition. What, was the position in regard to that? Mr, Ydlibi in reply made a rather confused statement at the end of which he said positively that the Americans were out of these negotiations and had no rights in the matter. This was not contradicted 'by Mr, JansOn, 6, I said that I should have to take advice on the point which the Company had raised and would communicate with them in due course regarding it* 1 might however remark that H.M.G, would certainly in no circumstances advise the Sheikh of Koweit to agree to any concession until they had seen and carefully scrutinised its terms. The Company's representatives thereupon offered to send a copy of the draft concession for information tomorrow. They added that they understood that the normal practice in approaching persons such as the Sheikh of Koweit was that the political authorities should 'be informed, 'but that the approach should be direct by the Company. The Sheikh of Koweit was inclined to be rather touchy, and might misunderstand it if the approach were made through E.M.G,' I replied that I was not in a position to indicate what 0 ur answer would be on this point which I should have to submit /(S) 3. submit for consideration. The Company expressed the hope that they would receive a reply at as early a date as possible, 7. As they left I reverted to the indefinite character of the evidence that the Saudi Government were in any way committed, Mr. Janson and Mr, Ydlibi repeated the statement in paragraph 3 above, and the latter handed me as supplementary evidence copy of a letter in Arabic which he had, he said, just received, /A rrangements will be made to translate and circulate this^y J.

The Arabian Deyelopment Syndicate Ltd., London, E.G.2 Dear Sirs, I enclose herewith Mr, Aoueini's report on his negotiations for the Neutral Zone Concession. Kindly note that as Mr, Aoueini will have no code book with him in Beyrouth it will be necessary for you to communicate with him, when you desire to do so, through me. Yours faithfully, (Sgd,) H.C.Hammond.COPT s.s. mopi 10 th Ma:/ 1934 Translation of a report submitted to the Arabian PeTelopment Syndicate Limited , I^UTRAL ZOM Soon after the receipt of the Power-of Attorney, I resumed negotiations yjith the Saudi Government preparatory to the signature of the Agreement by Shaikh Abdallah el Suleiman, Minister of Finance, who is authorised by the Government to sign on its behalf as I am duly authorised to sign on behalf of the Company. Having prepared the imj and after arriving at an agreement on both sides on all matters under discussion, we arranged for a final meeting when it was proposed to effect the signature of the contract. At this juncture, however, a new apprehension seems to have dominated the Government and that is - as long as this Zone is in partnership between the Hedjaz and the Kuwait Governments and as long as it is ftot legal that either the one or the other of these Governments grant the right of exploitation of this Zone in part or as a ^hole, to anyone, unless both Governments who own this right ^ conjunction agree to it. On the other hand, the British Government is the mandatory Power in Kuwait and owing to the rn -T -rr-i 6 0 oa and special relations between the Hedjaz and the British Governments especially now when the Government of the Hedjaz 18 in a State of War with the Yeman, it was considered disable, under the present conditions prevailing and for Political reasons, to take the opinion of the British Govc ^nment before the signature of the contract.- 2 - The Foreign Ministry, however, had communicated with the British Plenipotentiary Minister at Djeddah and informed him about the Government's views and its consent to grant the Concession - on its part - to the Arabian Development Syndicate Limited. The Government insinuated, hcwever, that they were desirous of obtaining the British views concerning this Zorie but pointed out that the Company who were desirous of securing the Concession was British with British Capital. The Brrtish Minister asked for a delay of two days to enable him to communicate with his own Government on the subject. Later the foil ova ng which is a resume of the opinion of the British Government, was handed in writing to the Foreign Ministry of Hedjaz. 'It is a well known fact that this Zone is Neutral between Kuwait and the Arab Saudi Government and that it isbwned in partnership between the two countries and it cannot be divided between them. Mb Concession for i the exploitation of this Zone can be given to anyone unless it is agreed upon by both the Kuwait and the Arabian Saudi Government. Although the Company that had asked for the Concession is British, the British Government is of the opinion that it is only reasonable that the Company in question, should approach either the Kuwait or the British Government in the same manner as it had approached the Arabian Saudi Government and arrange to get its approval in the same manner as it had obtained the Saudi Arabian Government T s approval to the granting of the Concession. Then and not till then the arrangement would be legal. The/- 3 - The British Government sav; nothing in the suggested method of dealing with the matter that would touch the feelings of the Company or affect the Saudi Government if they were to take such a step; on ths other hand the British Government were of the opinion that this would respect the rights of Kuwait, the legal partner in this Zone,' On receipt of this reply the Saudi Government, whose interests require that they should at all times maintain good relations with the British Government, and in consideration of the British Government's desire and request in this matter concerning their mutual interests, sent me a letter, a copy of which is attached, requesting me to urge you to communicate with the British Government in connection with the Concession of the Neutral Zone in the same manner as we'had approached the Saudi Government. On receipt of this letter I arranged for a personal interview with the British Minister at Djeddah, to ascertain Ms views personally. He repeated the same instructions submitted above, I accordingly cabled to 2€r, Ydlibi the gist of my various conversations and requested him to allow me to proceed to Cairo to submit my report and take the necessary instructions regarding this matter. In reply Mr, Ydlioi telegraphed stating that it is necessary to obtain a written consent from the Government, Since a written consent is tantamount to signature of the Concession the Government when I approached them with a request for a written consent advised me to this effect and stated that the personal promise given to Mr, Ydlibi by His liajeoty the King io in Itself a consent. In view of the fact that the /- 4 - the British Government had nov^ eicpressed its wishes in the matter the Saudi GoYernment v^ere of the opinion that it would not be advisable at this juncture to give a written document unless the British Government or the Shaikh of Kuwait were previously advised of the fact, The Government stated, however, that as a special case it would suffice if a simple letter were received from the Shaikh of Kuwait addressed to the Company advising them that | . f[r . | . i, r i™-i i mr n ■■ he would 'be prepared to accept the terms of the Concession if the Saudi Arabian Government agree to it, and that he would be prepared to sign the agreement if the Saudi Goirernment would do so. The Government added that this was clear evidence of their desire to facilitate our business and grant us the Concession. I repeat again that the Government here has special reasons, Ytfhich I cannot disclose, that prevent it from signing the Concession before they are in receipt of, at least, such a letter as they have suggested, from the Shaikh of Kuwait. As soon as I have given a copy of this report to Mr. Haomond to translate into English and submit to you, I shall leave for Beyrout where I shall be awaiting your instructions. I left at Bjeddah my agent Ibrahim Shakir who is well known to ijj, Ydlibi to carry on in case an emergency should arise, during my absence. I have to inform you also, that the iynerican Co.. tried to enter into negotiations with the Government regarding t^is Zone, but the Government pointed out clearly that that 18 ^ot possible. - The American Engineer returned from his tour of Aspect ion to the Western Zone and left forHassa where he is/- 5 - is supposed to prepare his report which will be submitted to the Government. Now the point of issue is to obtain a letter from the Shaikh of Kuwait consenting to grant the Concession on his part, I leave this matter to you to decide; but if you find that my departure to Kuwait with any other person in whom you confide is useful, I shall leave as soon as you request me to do so. Or if you diecide to send somebody else whom you can trust and who is on good relations with the Shaikh of Kuwait, please inform me of the fact so that I might meet him where you think most convenient and acquaint him with the situation and I suggest that this should be promptly done as no time is to be lost in waiting. My address in Beirut is known to you. Tours, Hussein Aoueini,Copy of letter received from Ministry of Finance.

My dear Warner, Many thanks for your letter of the 28th May enclosing a draft telegram to Ryan consequent on the recent interview here with Janson and Ydlibi on the subject of an oil concession for the Koweit Neutral Zone. interests of putting Ryan as fully as possible in possession of such information as is available to us) would like to suggest the minor additions which I set out below. Paragraph 1. ? redraft to read: 'Saudi Government had, so far as they were concerned, in principle committed themselves to grant of concession to'• At the end of the same paragraph we might, in view of Auwayni's note, add something like this:- H If the Sheikh of Koweit were now to state in writing that he would be prepared to accept terms of concession and to sign agreement, subject to Saudi Government also being prepared to accept and sign, that would satisfy Saudi Government • We concur generally in the telegram but (in the •A.Warner Esq.., or eign Office, S.W.I, Paragraph/Paragraph 2, Line 4. ? Add 'Draft concession submitted by Syndicate also a provides for advance of £50,000 in gold to 'be recovered from royalties to grantas of concession on discovery of oil in commercial quantities and advance of further £50,000 gold within one year of date of first payment'. Paragraph 5. After 'out of the field' ? insert 'Auwayni reports that they had tried to enter into negotiation with Saudi G-overnment, ^Tout the Government pointed out clearly that this is not possible''. Paragraph 4, ? insert after words 'Saudi Government's' the words 'position in regard to'« Last three lines. I do not think it would 'be possible to prevent the Syndicate (who have indeed behaved entirely properly so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned) from approaching the Sheikh of Itoweit, though we should, of course, much prefer to delay this if possible until the oil negotiations in regard to Koweit are disposed of and the Iraq. Petroleum Company can make an advance. But we should I imagine confine ourselves to informing the Sheikh that the Arabian Development Syndicate have asked to be allowed to approach him; that His Majesty's Government have replied that/1/ that they have no objection; but that they aro entirely uncommitted as regards any proposals which the Syndicate may put forward; and that (if Ryan confirms that this is the case, as the correspondence available to us would appear to suggest) so far as they know Ibn Saud is still quite uncommitted in the matter. It might be better to say nothing to Ryan in the light of which he might say anything to the Saudis which would lead them to think that we were likely to give any active support to Ydlibi with the Sheikh. If you think there is anything in this you may be prepared to consider a uedraft of the last four lines to run as follows:- '♦.and that His Majesty's Government are anxious to have complete and definite information in the matter to enable them to consider the reply to be given to the Syndicate'• 3* Y/e are disposed to think that it would be well for Ryan in his conversation with Puad to refer again to the fact that an understanding as regards jurisdiction and protection would be an essential preliminary to our agreeing to the grant of any concession by the Sheikh in respect of the Neutral Zone. If you agree, perhaps you would add something to cover this.F.Z. iLi o r INDIA OFFICE, LONDON f' Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

Stevens and Mr. Lefroy called to discuss the position with Sir Louis Kershaw on the 28th May. They were anxious to ascertain whether any further report had t)een received ±rom Koweit, and to consult us on certain developments reported by their own representatives. 2o The Company were informed that we had had no report as yet from Colonel Dickson as to the sheikh's reaction to the letter which the Political Agent had heen instructed to despatch to him in our telegram of i9th May, No. 1321. There seemed, however, no reason to draw any adverse inference from this fact. The letter would take time to translate and it would prohahly he unwise to rush the discussion of matters such as it dealt with. The Company agreed. 3. Asked whether they on their side had any information to give, the Company's representatives stated that they had received from their representatives a copy of a draft (now attached) which had, without authorisation from the Company, 'been submitted to the Sheikh, and which embodied certain alterations, some of which were unacceptable to the Company. In particular the revise included a redraft of Article 6 on the subject of the Chief Local Representative, which was not only unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Company, but which, so far as H.M.G-. were concerned, included a Provision that the selection and the appointment of the 'w, luKJuj ^mirr *'******—'''''tf v i, fr'*ivrnTrr*~ , n'rrn i r rtiUtf4W Chief Local Representative should rest entirely with the Sheikh in consultation with The negotiators, had reported that they had embodied this redraft in the draft Agreement in the light of a statement by the Sheikh that it represented what had been agreed between him and H»M»G.- a - (through the Hasldent). They admitted that the Political ilgent Had informed them that no decision had yet he en reached, hut felt that they had no option hut to accept the sheikh's statement. 4. Sir Louis Kershaw expressed great surprise that iwnm iiiiiiii n — **''• ^ . the Company's representatives should have committed themselves in any way to a proposition of this nature. The Company were not concerned with the political aspects -rrrr* of this question, out solely with the commercial aspects. The position oFhTmTg . in regard to the selection and appointment of the Chief Local Representative had already been made quite clear to the Company; and we had informed ft] Colonel Dickson on 19th My that we could not agree to relax our requirements on this point. We would consult the sheikh ana give him every opportunity of making any observations that occurred to him, hut the last word must rest with H.M.G. A clause of the nature suggested was not only open to the strongest objections from the standpoint of , hut appeared also to he ohjection- y-ble from the point of view of the company. The Company's representatives expressed entire agreement. 5o The Company's representatives went on to say 'that Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm had strongly urged that they should he allowed to return to London to discuss Matters# The psychological effect on the sheikh would he Sood, and even if the Company could make no further concession, His Excellency would feel that no stone had been left unturned. They were anxious to know what we bought of this. They were informed in reply that on the face of it there seemed nothing to he gained, on the a ssumption that no further concessions weis to he made, hy a/- 3 - a postponement of the negotiations such as would he involved. They said that that had been their own view, and after further discussion it was understood that they would mke it clear to Major Holmes and Mr. Ghisholm that the Company could not agree to a special visit to London, and that they considered that the commercial negotiations should be disposed of with the. minimum of delay as soon as the political points (which were solely matters between and the Sheikh)had been settled. It is understood that Mr* Stevens and Mr. Lefroy might, in the event of the political difficulties being removed but no conclusion appearing possible to the commercial negotiations, consider visiting Koweit themselves. They did not, however, propose to indicate this to their representatives. 30th May 1934. JtG.

He, however, felt bound to make the following conditions purely to safeguard the rights of his owl people and local shipownerst- (i) Kuwait Sailing Craft at all times to be allo'wed full use of the whole of Shuwaikh harbour, there being no question of the R .A.F. denying them access to^ tlie harbour, or any part of it. (ii) That if possible tlie mooring buoys should be placed at the westerly end of the harbour so as to be interfered with as little as possible by sailing craft entering or leav ing the harbour. (lii) That the R.A.F. Officer told off to lay the moorings should work in cooperation and in company with one of his (the Shaikh's officials wlien selecting the actual site for the mooring buoys in question, as the latter could point out dhow anchorages and assist generally, and misunderstandings would be avoided.

It however/It is however used by every n East Indian man tt arriving from Zanzibar or India, whose dpeCft does not permit of entry into the docking areas situate in front of the Town,. These ships unload their cargo at Shuwai}di and later enter the recognized docking areas* It is imperative that these ships be not interfered with or denied entry into the Shuwaikh harbour, else they cannot discharge^ The harbour is also used for laden sailing craft arriving in a storm or when the tide is at ebb, as a temporary 'refuge' where they can get shelter.. The writer cannot visualize a situation arising where sailing craft would interfere with air moorings, if the latter were placed out of the immediate fair way and at the western end of the harbour as the available water expanse is very great, 4 # I next turned to the question of the land area 1(a) which the R.A.F. hope to acquire at a later date at an agreed rental of per annum, but which they find it inconvenient to take up at present. In very general terms I explained to His Excellency that what ^he R.A.F® proposed was to give him the Shaikh £»100/'* per annum for the tin© being, which paynent to give thou so to speak a lien on the area in questionC^Araboon' as the Arabs call it), so that in the event of their deciding to take up the area permanently at a later date which they hoped would be the case, they would be able to do so without difficulty# Further that when that time arrived, they, the R.A.F., were quite prepared to pay his, the Shaikh's, figure of £.1200, as rental# 5. His Excellency who throughout our talk seemed interested, and listened with marked courtesy to all my points,pointed out that, although he would prefer an immediate settlement, he would agree to the arrangement proposed^ out of friendship for myself and for His Majesty's G-ovemment, but on one condition only, namely that thef that tbe arrangement should be considered a temporary one and not extend beyond two years* In other words that the IUA.F. could leave the question of definitely taking up the area they had their eye on^ ^open' for the next 2 years only, but that at the end of that period they must decide either (a) to give up all idea of renting the area in question and cease paying him £,100 a year or (b) take up the land for good at a rental of £.1200 per annum# He, the Shaikh, could not allow the R.A.F# to go on for an unlimited period keeping their lien on such valuable land. This was only fair to himself. 6. At this stage, I thought it best to close the interview, and promised to convey the gist of our talk, which I emphasized was made without prejudice, to His Majesty^ Grovemment throu^i Major Watts and the Political Resident • 7. Before I left^the Shaikh remarked that both matters Ca) and (b) above could be conveniently settled by an exchange of letters with my successor (Major Watts) to which I agreed. 8. I have no comoients to make beyond saying that the Shaikhs points seemed to me highly reasonable, and that in both cases I think the R.A.F. would do well to agree out of hand with the Shaikh*s conditions.

Bate d the 21st June 1934. &gt; A m in} Please refer to my telegram No,215 of 18tli inst., in ^iiioh I mentioned that Ghisholm had left for England on 17 th, 2. I thought it might be of interest to you to know the circumstances under which he left in view of last para of Secretary of State's telegram No.1530 of June 12th, 3. When recalling Holmes to London the Kuwait Oil Company had stated in a long telegram showed me by Chisholm that they considered their representatives here were not putting their case to the Shaikh quite as they wanted and they felt if they got Holmes back and cleared up y from their point of view^various points about which there appeared a lack of understanding , that Holmes could return quickly to Kuwait and approach the Shaikh once more. Chisholm meanwhile would remain here so as to keep the negotiations still in existence. 4. Chisholm replied to this telegram by another equally long, the gist of which was that further negotiations on the latest terms offered by the Company were for the present of no use. The Shaikh had declared that,unless the whole of his demands were acceded to ; he did not wish to resume discussions for another 3 months and,that if the Company were unable to go to this extent / Holmes 1 return to Kuwait before September would gain nothing. Under these circumstances, added Chisholm, he saw no use in remaining on himself in Kuwait and he therefore proposed, unless he had definite instructions to the contrary, to leave for England forthwith. HoIhe s added a sentence to this telegram to the/ I Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, HJSHIRS .to the effect that he agreed with Chisholm's views» Apparently no-Qiing was heard from the London Office of the Company since Chisholm left for London, as reported^ on 17 th. 5, Chisholm informed me that only 2 important points could not be agreed upon by the Company and the Shaikh: (i) was the question of the appointment by the Shaikh of one of the Directors on the Company's Board in London: (ii) Amount of royalty to be paid to the Shaikh. There was a difference of Annas 6 per ton oil in the amount offered by the Company and demanded by the Shaikh. The actual figure offered could not be mentioned. CM''4./ Confidential .

The information relating to the Saudi Government's approach to the concession is relayed through letters and reports from Sir Andrew Ryan, HM Minister at Jedda, and contain details of his discussions with representatives of both the Saudi Government and the oil companies.The correspondence also includes a discussion relating to land at Shuwaikh, identified by the British Government for possible use as an air base, and includes negotiations over the cost of renting the site or the possibility of reserving it for future use. Also included are details of reconnaissance undertaken by the Air Officer Commanding for alternative sites, which was unsuccesful, and correspondence regarding the use of Kuwait Harbour for flying boats and the need to identify suitable locations in the Harbour for moorings.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian Development Syndicate Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Saudi Arabia, Āl Sa'ūd dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Fuad Bey Hamza</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shuwaikh </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait Harbour</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait-Nejd Neutral Zone</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000269#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
