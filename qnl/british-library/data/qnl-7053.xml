May 1913 - July 1916, (Received from Chief Political Officer. Basra, under Sir P.Cox'a letter of 18th August 1916 Mo # 3). — hTft/a The rebellion against the Sultan of Ibscat is due partly ifo old and deepaeated matters of disagreement and partly to the reflex action of modern European politics in the Grulf on the internal affairs of f 0man. Chief amang the former causes of unrest is the curious and interesting survival in 'Oman of the very ancient rivalry between the Ahl Qibli and the Ahl al Shirnal, the southern tribes of Yaman origin and the northern tribes descended from Nizar ibn Ma^dd, represented respectively in 'Oman by the TT inawi and Grhafiri groups. Though tbese two factions which are almost identical with the older divisions, did not spting into existence as actively hostile elements until the Civil wars, which rent 'Oman in the 18th century, they revived an enmity which £pes back to the days before the Prophet, Roughly speaking the G-hafiri or NizaritiQ3 are not present with the Sultan, while the Hinawi, or Yamanites are with the Imam. A second and very fertile source of division between the Sultan and his subjects in the interior was the transference of the capital in 1784 from Rustaq in the Wadi Fara to ~ usqat. This was done by Hamad, son of the Imam Said ibn Ahmad, Said, son of the founder of the Al Bu Saidi dynasty, was the last elected Imam of Oman to hold sovereign power, and when he was forced to abdicate in favour of his more capable son, he was left to vegetate at Rustaq while the seat of Government was moved to the coast. Thereby the rulers of Oman were assured of an easily collected customs revenue enabling them to preserve a serrfclance of authority by bribery alone, they were absolved fromfrom the necessity of maintaining themselves by Military and Political efficiency, and exposed to foreign influences which alienated from them the aympathiea of the tribes in the interior. To these foreign influences, to the reliance of the Sultans of Masqat on foreign naval and military power and their enforced submission to foreign requirements in the matter of the traffic in slaves and in arms, the modern causes of unrest belong. The late Sultan, Saiyid Faisal ibn Turki, sav/ in the suppression of the arms trade by the British Government a distinct advantage to himself, since his rebellious subjects were unable to furnish themselves with weapons to use af?ainst him, but before his death the discontent which it had caused among the tribes had come to a head. The chief Shaikh of the Ibadhi, to which sect most of the Hinawi tribes belong, housed the country by his preaching, in which he represented the Arms Warehouse as a device of the English to deprive the tribes of Oman of modern weapons, and in f/ay 1913 the Imam of Tanuf, Salim ibn Rashid al Kharusi rose in revolt, Nizwa, one of the chief towns of 'Oman proper, fell in Junem Izki, immediately to the east of Kizwa, in the following month. After the fall of Izki the rebels already had among them as temnoral leaders * Shaikh Hamyar ibn Kacir and llabhan, the Tamimah of the Bani Riyan, were joined by Shaikh Isa ibn Salih, son of the faraour Shaikh ibn Ali Al Ilarithi who led the great revolt against Saiyid Faisal in 1B95, Shaikh Isa, an austere man of strong character though far from unamenable to bribes, is the leading figure in the confideration. InIn July 1913 the situation became so threatening tbjat the British Government sent a !3 rv Tall garriton to - atrah on the coast north of Muoqat tut the rebels continuod to gain ground and in Aup^ist Samail fell into their hands. In September we doubled the garrison at Bait al ^alaj near Uisqat. Saitid Faisal died in October and mis succeeded by his son 3ayid Tairaur who, relying on an olc! personal friendship with Shaikh Isa, opened negotiations with him, as a result of which Shaikh Isa visited - usoat in December. No permanent result was V.owever attained. In April 1914 the rebels were intimidated by the bombardment of Barkah and Qaryat by H.LI.S. Fox and H,!', .3.Dartmouth but in August fresh hostile movements were set on foot which made it necessary to send reinforcements to the garrison at Musqat. In January 1915 the Imam's followers attacked the British outposts and met with a crushing defeat. The Viceroy visited Muaqat in the following month and took the opportunity of recommending the Sultan to come to terms with his rebellious subjects, pointing out that the British garrison would not be maintained indefinitely. He offered the services of the Political Agent as mediator. The latter summed up the difficulties of the situation in the following terms 1, The rebels held the key of the situation in the r )ossession of Samail valley and fort which were essential to the commercial prosperity of Muaqat # 2. The rising had assumed a religious character and the Imam was preaching a Jihad, i'oreover so many of the rebels had been killed by our troops in the unsuccessful attack in January that feelings of resentment had been aroused which it would be difficult to allay.3. The offer of tribal allowances was not likely to prove a strong inducement, the Imam might he prevented, hy religious scruples from accepting an allowance and the other two leaders enjoyed good incomes from their present positions and the appropriation of 3tate lands in the interior. 4. The reduction of the garrison to normal strength would leave the Sultan without support, since in war time H.M. 1 s ships were not, as was usual in peace time, within a few hours call of Musqat. Reports were however received from the interior that the rebels were discouraged by the January reverse and anxious to come to terms, the Sultan was glad to accept the proposed mediation of the Political Agent, and in April the latter despatched letters to the three rebel leaders, the Imam Salim ibn Rashid al Khasi Shaikh Isa ibn Salih and Shaikh Harayar ibn Nasir, asking them to state frankly their views and feelings and offering to try and find a modus Vivendi. The Imam replied that he must consult his people who were in the hands of their priests, that these latter were scattered over the country from Sharqiyah to Nizwa and were being summoned to a conference. Hamyar suggested that a Mahomedan representation should be sent to discuss the question. Shaikh Isa did not reply until May when a letter neither signed nor sealed was received from him through the Imam. It was friendly in tone and showed a desire to open negotiations. He mentioned that he was sending an envoy, Abdullah ib&gt;i Hamad, to see the Sultan. All reports combined to show that the despatch of letters by the Political Agent was popularly regarded as a symptom of weakness on the part of the BritishBritish who were credited with wishing to withdraw their troops. Evidence of extensive intrigue hy German Agents in the interior was not wanting. It was generally believed hy the tribes that the Germans were victorious, that the emperor and his followers had embraced Islam, and that the moment was propitious for driving the sultan and the English out of the country. In spite of the friendly character of Shaikh 'Isa's letter the sultan was convinced that the religious element was opposed to peace; an intercepted letter, written by Nasir ibn Sulairnan Siyabi of Samail stated that the Imam and Shaikh Hamyar would accept Shaikh Isa's advice, but that the Imam would never consent to make open surrender and would fight to the end to overthrow the present state of affairs in Musqat, where there was no rahomedan law or Justice. Following upon the replies from the leaders, Humaid ibn Saiyid al Fulcdti of Wadi Ito^awah visited the Political Agent with the object of obtaining further information as to the terms of the negotiation. He is a man of some intelligence and instruction, he has trade interests in socotra, knows the Aden authorities and has been employed by them as an intermediary in a Socotra dispute. He expressed his views, which were probably those of the rebel leaders as follows:- 1. The people as a whole welcomed British intervention, but were anxious to know what we expected to gain. 2. Tile sultan was not really anxious for a reconciliation, but was moved by a wish to please the English. 3. He does not conform to the Mahommedan faith and is regarded as a heretic. 4. Peace could only be agreed to on the following terms:-A. Full recognition of the ohara law, as practised by the Imam in substitution for the present unjust system of dealing with civil cflid crimineA cases* There was to be no favouritism towards people connected with the apalace. B. Removal of British troops and of the land blockade of imports into the interior• C. Full settlement of the financial claims of the tribes of the interior. 1). Importation of wine f spirits and tobacco to be prohibited. E. The Sultan to be regarded as Ruler of Oman, but the Imam to administer the country according to the Shara, either personally or through a representative at Musqat. P. Free purchase of arms and armiunition to be allowed• Humaid was informed in general terms what demandsxcould not be considered. 1. Any demand thatimplied the non-recognition of the sultan's legitimate rights in Musqat and the interior. 2. Any demand implying the contravention of treating rights between Great Britain and the Sultan, in which connection we recognised no one but Saiyid Taimur. 3. Any demand that might injure or hamper our trade. 4. Any demand for the discontinuance of the existing Arms Varehourse arrangements. In June letters were received from Humaid al Fulaiti and from the Qadhi of the Imam, ♦Abdullah Ibn Ralahid al Hashimi the latter unsigned unsealed but purporting to represent the views of the Imam, Humaid admittedjoined him a defection from the Sultan of 500 to 1000 men. Towards the end of July Hamad ibn Ibrahim, a cousin and friend of the oultan, in more or less independent possession of the forts of Rustaq and Hazam, surrendered to the Imam. Some discussion concsrning him had arisen between the Imam and Shaikh Isa, the former wishing to remove him from Rustaa while the latter was in favour of his being allowed to remain. The incidence of Ramdhan has of coufse helped to delay any active revival of the rebellion, but the trend of current reports seems to indicate that Musqat affairs may come into prominence t^gain during the coming winter.

Bell gives a description of the causes of the rebellion against the Sultan of Muscat, which, in her opinion, were 'partly due to old and deepseated matters of disagreement and partly to the reflex action of modern European politics'. She goes on to describe various events from May 1913 to July 1916, including: the fall of Nizwa [Nizwá] and Izki [Izkī]; the visit of the Viceroy to Muscat in February 1914; the death of Fayṣal; the religious character of the uprising ('Jihad'); and potential peace terms.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Taymūr bin Fayṣal Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0003c8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
