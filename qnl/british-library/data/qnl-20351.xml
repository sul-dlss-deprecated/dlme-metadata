I HAVE the honour to report that I presented my credentials as His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affaires on the 22nd instant at the local office of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. I was in uniform and was received with a guard of honour. 3. The ceremony was of a simple nature in contrast to that which took place three weeks ago when my French colleague, as reported in my despatch No. 11 of the 10th instant, presented to the Emir Feisal similar credentials as Charge d'Affaires, which were, however, addressed by the President of the French Republic to the King! 4. I took the opportunity of assuring the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that I vshould continue to devote myself to the cultivation of friendly relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Great Britain, and added a few complimentary remarks. Sheikh Fuad replied in suitable terms, and after a little further conversation I left. No one else was present at the interview. I have, &amp;c. W. L. BOND.

The Hejaz authorities went out of their way to show attention to me on my arrival. Ihe Governor of Jedda sent the officer commanding the garrison to welcome me on board the Dahlia, and himself came down to the landing-stage to leceive me. In addition to his own greetings, he brought me complimentary messages from the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and its dependencies, including an expression of regret that His Majesty had had to leave Jedda (where he had been spendmg a couple of days), and would be unable to receive me until after the pilgrimage. After responding suitably to these courtesies, I drove to the Legation m a car provided by the Governor. 4. In the evening the King caused further messages to be telephoned to me, and ag.uii connrmed them next morning. In addition to replying in the same manner I asked the Governor, when calling on him on the morning of the 7th May, to convey my warmest thanks to the King, as he, the Governor, was about to go to Mecca for the pilgrimage. At this visit, the Governor, after a cordial exchange of compli ments, discoursed to me at some length on the improvements made by Ibn Saud in the arrangements for the pilgrimage, his desire to improve them still further, and his anxiety to collaborate with His Majesty's Government in doing as much as possible to ensure the well-being of pilgrims, especially from the sanitary point of view. I assured the Governor that His Majesty's Government appreciated what had been done, and would be most ready to harmonise their efforts in the same direction on behalf of British pilgrims with those of the King of the Hejaz. 5. I am happy to think that everything connected with my arrival went in such a way as to create a good local impression and to emphasise the importance of the decision of His Majesty's Government to appoint a Minister here. By a fortunate coincidence, my arrival took place on Accession Day. The firino- of a further salute and the dressing of ships, including a large number of pilgrim ships m honour of that anniversary, gave additional dignity to the visit of H.M.S. ' Dahlia.' r 6. On the 7th May, I wrote to the Emir Feisal as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, to ask formally for an audience to present my credentials. Although I have had no reply as yet, \ have reason to think that the audience will be fixed for an early day after the 12th May.

Jedda, May 28, 193U. / IN the note on various matters of protocol enclosed in my despatch No. 114 oi the 18th instant, I referred to the question of formal visits by foreign representatives to King Ibn Sand's Heir Apparent as one which had not been raised in my conyersa- tions with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and which need not arise at present. I have the honour to state that it has in fact arisen much sooner than I anticipated. 2. Late in the evening of the 25th May, I received a telephone message from the assistant to the Governor of Jedda to the effect that the Emir Sand was arriving early next morning, and would receive me the next morning at 10-10 a.m . On enquiry, I found that the intention of the Prince was to receive the foreign repre sentatives officially, and that uniform would be appropriate. He received us in succession, beginning with the Soviet Minister, at the Green Palace, which. Sheikh Fuad Hamza tells me, is now definitely the property of the King. I took with me the same party, minus the Legation interpreter, as when I presented credentials. The Prince, who was attended by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, placed me on a sofa beside him. The reception was on the same lines as the less formal part of the proceedings when the King himself received me. 3. The Governor of Jedda had issued invitations for a dinner, given also at the Palace, but apparently bv the local authorities, in honour of the Heir Apparent. It was a hot evening, and it was happily arranged that the European guests might wear ordinary evening dress, in which vogue of attire a black dinner jacket, though all do not own to it, is still the high-water mark in Jedda. Having surmounted the perils of a staircase roughly laid with a carpet almost completely unsecured by rods, Mr. Bond and I were conducted to the roof. Having been welcomed by the Governor, we passed between a double file of armed retainers to the furthest end, where the Prince received us. The Soviet Minister had already arrived, and we took our places right and left of His Highness. 4. After coffee and compliments, the company of twenty-three people, including all the foreign representatives, except the Turk and the Persian and the principal officials of Jedda and the King's entourage, went indoors to a long, narrow dining room, which, with attendant servants and slaves, we pretty completely filled. The electric plant having failed, the table was lit by large incandescent lamps. The warmth of the atmosphere was increased by several enormous dishes of mutton, which remained on the table from start to finish, although they formed but one course in a protracted meal. The table was further decorated in a manner which somewhat shocked mv sense of Islamic propriety, with images of birds and other animals, executed in what I supposed to be white and gold glass or china, but which, Mr. Bond assures me, were made of sugar. The fruit dishes, in coloured and gilt glass, added to the gaiety of a crowded board. Although the electrical plant was got going in the course of the meal and a revolving fan supplemented the simple slave-driven variety, the relief was general when we again adjourned to the roof, where, after half an hour of further conversation and light refreshment, we took leave. 5. I was distinctly impressed by the personality of the Prince. Tall and slender, he resembles his father cast in a finer, if less imposing, mould. His features are well marked and he conceals his eye trouble behind glasses, and he has a most engaging smile. In his conversation he showed great vivacity. He confined it almost entirely to the Soviet Minister and myself. As M. Turakouloff speaks both Turkish and stumbling Arabic, he was able to converse direct, and was good enough to act to some extent as interpreter between the Emir and me. At the outset of the conversation before dinner the Emir plunged into a glorification of Islam, which my Russian colleague echoed with contributions of his own. After dinner His Highness reverted to the subject, and said how mistaken it was to suppose that Islam was incompatible with civilisation. Eager to be polite without any approach to the profession of an alien faith, I said that, indeed, there should be no conflict. I related [139 r—1]how I myself, going to church in Hampstead one Sunday morning in a tramcar, otherwise empty except for the driver and the conductor, had heard one of them say to the other : ' What do we want with .... religions now we're civilised ? ' and how much more civilised I had felt myself to be than the speaker. It gave me some satisfaction to have this simple tale translated by the representative of Soviet Russia, although I had to omit the epithet preceding ' religions.' 6. On the 27th May the Prince sent two persons, the Assistant Governor and the officer commanding the garrison, to return the visit which I had paid him. 7. The Emir was expected to stay here a few days, but he changed all his plans and returned to Mecca on the evening of the 27th May. I hear from a confidential source that his recall was due to the arrival of news of some trouble in Nejd. I cannot vouch for this information, but as it was the Prince's first visit to Jedda since 1926 there must have been some important reason for his sudden departure. 8. As my main object in writing this despatch is to provide a full record for future reference of ceremonial now observed here, I may mention that, in addition to calling officially on the other foreign representatives after I had presented my credentials, T also called on the Governor of Jedda, as being the chief local authority in what is becoming the diplomatic capital.

WITH reference to my telegrams Xos. 94 and 95 of the 3()tli June, I have the honour to state that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Hejaz-Nejd Minister Designate in ti London, left for his post to-day, taking the Khedivial steamship ' Taif ' as far as Suez. I gave a small dinner party in his honour last evening, in the course of which he said that he expected to stay about a fortnight in Egypt and would go on to London via Marseilles. 2. The record of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba is so well known to you that it is unnecessary for me to say anything of his antecedents. I have not seen enough of him to have formed any personal estimate of his present outlook. I give with reserve the following impressions derived from reports which have reached me:— (а) He would be glad to see much closer relations between Great Britain and this country on terms favourable to the latter. (б) He is hostile to the ' Syrian party,' the protagonists in which are Sheikhs Fuad Hamza and Yussef Yassin, and is specially hostile towards the latter. (c) His own position vis-d-vis of the King is probably that the latter values his opinions, but frequently finds them unpalatable. He himself finds the King difficult. He told one of my informants, nevertheless, that a special code had been arranged which would enable him to communicate with Ibn Saud independently of the Syrians. {d) He does not think that the King is disposed to break with the Syrians at present, perhaps for reasons connected with ultimate aspirations in regard to Syria. It is suggested even that Ibn Saud hopes one day to secure the - throne of that country for one of his sons. 3. I may mention in this connexion that reports have been rife for some time to the effect that the King intends to make the Emir Feisal Minister for Foreign Affairs, retaining the services of Fuad Hamza as a subordinate. 4. Hafiz W T ahba told the informant already mentioned that the Hejaz Government intended to establish consulates at Bombay and Singapore, and that there was a dispute as to whether they should be under him as Minister in London or directly under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs here. 5. I am not circulating this despatch to any other post. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. [16-6 ee—2]this document is the property of his britannic majesty's goyeenment. EASTERN ( Arabia ).

Sir, Jedda, July 22, 1930. YOU are aware of the difficulties under which the more purely diplomatic work of this post is carried on. They are most painfully borne in on a person who is trying to build up a stronger British representation here than has been possible in the past. They result from the facts that the Legation is confined to Jedda; that the King, personally inaccessible except on rare occasions when he comes here, is both in theory and in practice the sole controller for Foreign Affairs; that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, such as it is, is in Mecca; and that the Acting Minister, who can at least discuss questions though he can take practically no decision, has to divide himself between fairly constant personal attendance on the King, now that the latter is at Taif, the management of his office at Mecca and occasional visits to Jedda, made at short notice and at irregular intervals. Fuad Bey Hamza—he prefers the ' bey to the ' sheikh,' I understand—has been in Jedda for the following periods only, since I arrived here on the 6th May ; — The 8th May when he returned from leave and proceeded direct to Mecca. Morning of the 17th May, when he came with the King to receive my credentials, until the afternoon of the 18th May, when he went to Mecca to rejoin the King. The 27th May to, I think, the 29th or 30th May, a short visit without the King. The 7th to 12th June, in attendance on the King with whom he arrived and left. The 11th July to the 18th July, without the King. Otherwise my personal intercourse with Fuad Hamza has been confined to conversations by telephone, and the telephonic service is only moderately efficient. 2. The difficulties of doing business are somewhat increased by imperfections in the organisation of the Legation, but these are our own concern and will come within the scope of a separate report. The other difficulties are more important as regards diplomatic work proper. Opportunities of discussing really serious questions with the King are reduced to a minimum. When he disappears into the blue, and so far as he is concerned even Mecca and Taif are the blue, we cannot count on any early opportunity of following up the discussions in personal conversation with his Minister, except for an occasional enquiry over the telephone. When Fuad Bey does visit Jedda, outstanding business of importance has to be brought up to date in a frantic rush. There is no time at all to discuss the numerous minor matters, which form the subject of notes, but which it should be possible for members of our staffs to discuss personally from time to time in order to promote the settlement of tiresome little questions and to relieve their chiefs. 3. I thought it desirable to make a statement of the whole subject to Fuad Bey on the 17th July in personal conversation. He had spoken hopefully some time before of the likelihood of Europeans being allowed access to Taif. On other occasions he had mentioned to me a plan for holding weekly diplomatic receptions at his office here and told me something of the difficulties which he himself experienced owing to the King s exigencies and aptness to upset plans. We had that morning been discussing ' Bon Voisinage with Iraq and had reached a point at which I had said that the King's attitude might impel His Majesty's Government to instruct me to seek an audience before going on leave. The ground was thus weJ prepared. 4. I was careful to say and to repeat at least once that I had no reason to complain of the treatment extended to me personally. The King had shown me the most distinguished consideration. When T was fortunate enought to get a chance of talking business with Fuad Bey, I was treated in the same manner and found myself face to face with a Minister of great ability. But I reminded Fuad Bey that the King had desired a Legation and had told me himself that one of his objects was to be able to open himself freely to a responsible senior official. I analysed the situation on the lines of the earlier paragraphs of this despatch; laying some stress on the impossibility of dealing with minor questions except by notes and reminders. 193 1—1]In this connexion I said that al] I knew of the Foreign Office in Mecca was that, according to the Hejaz Constitution, it should be organised in four sections. I had never set eyes on the heads of those sections and was uncertain as to their existence. In any normal country I should have the advantage of their acquaintance and members of my staff would be able to see such of them as dealt with our business. I contrasted my position with that awaiting Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, who on the eve of his departure had spoken to me cheerfully of escaping from the heat of London to the seaside and perhaps later running up to Scotland. Such happy anticipations inspired envy in the breast of an opposite number compelled to stew in Jedda all the time; but I went further. Suppose, I said, that King George assumed the sole direction of our foreign affairs; that the Foreign Office were moved to Oxford; that it were considered essential, in deference to the ancient Christian traditions of that place, to exclude from it Moslems, Brahmins and the disciples of Confucius; and that Hafiz Wahba were confined to London and the suburbs; would the Hejaz Government then think that they were justified in the expense of maintaining a Legation in Great Britain ? 5. In the course of my statement I referred again to the possibility of my being ^ instructed to ask for an audience of the King. I said that if this happened my only proper and polite course would be to ask to be received at Taif, as Ibn Saud was in residence there and I had no official knowledge that it was closed to foreign repre sentatives. In conclusion, I told Fuad Bey that my statement was of a purely personal nature, intended primarily for his own consumption. The matter might not be ripe for submission to the King, but I begged him to remember what I had said if one of these days I did ask for an audience at Taif or if, at some future date, His Majesty's Government conceived doubts as to the utility of maintaining a Minister here. 6. Fuad Bey is supporting a great burden, and in most ways impresses me more favourably than I expected. He listened to me carefully and welcomed, I think, a frank connected statement. At the end, he said that my criticism was justified. He was himself conscious of the defects of his machinery. He had not wished to trouble the King prematurely at a time of ^reat preoccupation, but he had now prepared a scheme for the consideration of His Majesty. He added spontaneously that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs ought to be in Jedda. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.this document is the property of his britannic majesty's government.

Sir, Jedda, July 23, 1930. I HAVE the honour to state that in conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs I have more than once touched on the question of the possibility of Hejaz-Nejd entering the League of Nations. 2. I threw out a first reference to the subject in one of my earlier conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza about the hon-voisinage agreement with Iraq. This is recorded in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 122 of the 29th May on that subject. 3. In a conversation on the 12th July regarding the position of this country in regard to the Arms Traffic Convention (see my despatch No. 185 of the 23rd July) Fuad Bey mentioned that he had received certain information bearing on the matter from the League. I said lightly that I was glad to learn that he was in communica tion with that body, upon which he said that he received but did not send communications. He intimated that he would be glad to have a talk with me on the subject. 4. On this and other occasions during Fuad Bey 's stay here, I adverted to the desirability of having as many Powers as possible in the League. We had a more connected, though inconclusive, conversation at our final meeting at my house on the 17th July. I again dwelt on the advantages of the League as an international organ, as a solvent of many questions of universal interest, and as an institution which had already proved its value in the direction of deterring nations from war, though it might not prevent all recurrence of war in the world. I said I knew that some Eastern countries adopted an attitude of reserve, either because they looked upon the League as a European club or because they shared the idea that it might be engineered into an instrument of the hegemony cf a single Power, an idea which I said was discounted by the fact that that fear had been expressed with reference to different Great Powers like Great Britain and France. 5. The only upshot of our conversation was that Fuad Bey said he did not know the King's attitude but continued to manifest interest and did not seem to exclude the possibility of the King's taking up the idea of becoming a member. I said that, if he were really interested and would care to have further information, I thought the best thing would be for me to discuss the matter during my approaching visit to London. 6. At a certain point in the conversation Fuad Bey said banteringly ; 'You know we are already members of the League.' I said I knew that the Hejaz in a previous sovereign incarnation was a signatory of the Covenant, but that King Hussein had for certain reasons conceived a rather violent distaste for the League. I remarked that Ibn Sand had not shown any alacrity in adopting European ideas about the responsibilities of succession States, but hinted that in this matter he might show himself to better advantage than King Hussein. When Fuad Bey left and we were almost slapping each other on the back in our joy at having concluded a series of strenuous discussicns, I harked back to the theme of 'the more the merrier/' 7. I thought it advisable at a suitable moment in the final conversation to advert to the subject of slavery, as being a matter to which the League of Nations paid great attention. As, however, I have occasion to address you separately on certain matters connected with slavery, I am recording this portion of the conversa tion in my despatch No. 187 of the 23rd July. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. [193 1—2]this document ib the property of his britannic majesty's oovebwmemt. EASTERN (Arabia ). August 11, 1930. CONFIDENTIAL. fj /,,, S ections. &gt;&gt;n [E 4311/1054/91] &gt; No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received August 11.) j A (No. 187. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, July 23, 1930. IN my despatch No. 186 of the 23rd July, relative to Ibn Saud's attitude towards the League of Nations, I have mentioned a conversation with the Acting ^ Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 17th July, in which I thought it well to advert to the subject of slavery. For the purposes of that conversation I stressed the importance attached to the question by the League, as well as by His Majesty's Government and British public opinion. I referred to Ibn Saud's obligation under article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda. 2. The Acting Minister said that the King had really done a good deal. He had expressly forbidden the landing of slaves in any of his ports. From the way Fuad Bey put this I was not sure how far south the operation of those orders extends. Even if J had been better prepared for the conversation, I might have hesitated to pursue this more closely, having regard to the status of Asir as a whole and the doubt regarding Medi, which Mr. Bond, in paragraph 35 of the memorandum enclosed in his despatch No. 60 of the 6th March, describes as an important, if not the chief, port concerned in the distribution of slaves. I may refer to my despatch No. 160 of the 2nd July, in which I had occasion to raise the question of the political position of Medi. 3. Fuad Bey admitted the possibility of smuggling, but said that smuggling by sea did not account for the importation of any appreciable number of slaves, [f any substantial number were, in fact, imported into this country, it was by the overland route from the Yemen. The King had taken certain measures in this direction also, and there was a regulation whereby any person bringing in slaves over the land frontier was bound to supply a certificate with photograph attached that the slave had grown up in slavery. I did not pursue the Yemen aspect of the question. 4. Two days after this conversation an incident occurred which fluttered this Legation considerably during the forenoon of Sunday, the 20th July. I enclose a memorandum by Mr. Hope-Gill dealing with this incident. Mr. Hope-Gill had already handled the matter promptly and ably up to an almost final stage before I reached the office. When I arrived I was able to put the one outstanding point to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs over the telephone in such a way as to make it almost impossible for the King to do anything but acquiesce in the departure of the one freed man already embarked whom it had been attempted to represent as a Royal slave. Although the incident was thus happily liquidated, I think it advisable to send you a full account of it, as the case raises issues which I will ask permission to discuss at the Foreign Office when on leave. 5. The Italian consul called on me next morning. We had a long and interesting conversation, which I will summarise as briefly as possible. 6. I expressed regret that M. Sollazzo had been involved in embarrassment as regards the sailing of his ship. I explained the facts fully, avoiding, however, any disclosure of the existence of the understanding about Royal slaves which Fuad Bey had invoked. I confined myself to stating that we were pursuing a great object which could only be achieved by educating Ibn Sand up to European ideas, and that it was in the interest of the final object, and might be necessary for larger political reasons, to use certain ' menagements ' in cases in which the King had a personal interest. 7. M. Sollazzo said he wished to make a quite definite statement. He would have been prepared the previous day to disembark the four men on a formal request from me. If, however, a similar case arose in the future he would not return to land any person embarked in an Italian ship, and more particularly any person in regard to whom a question of slavery or return to slavery arose, unless that person [193 1—3]himself consented. I said I was reporting the incident of the previous day for your consideration I could only say personally that I welcomed his frank statement. meant that Italy would take a hand. If circumstances did arise in which I for reasons of my own asked that a manumitted slave embarked by this Legation on an Italian ship should be sent back and M. Sollazzo refused to allow it, the difference between us would be formal. I should, in fact, be delighted. 8. M. Sollazzo had previously told me that he was staying on here to see the negotiations tor a treaty with Ibn Saud through to a finish. He is a whole-hearted advocate of early recognition of Ibn Saud by Italy. In our conversation on the 7 . \ ^ said that he was having difficulty over the inclusion of an article similar to article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda. He had been met with an intimation that Great Britain herself was ready to delete that article. He asked me whether this was true. 9. I said that the subject of the slave trade was not one which I had been able o s ud\ in all Us aspects, as 1 intended to do. For that reason—and 1 wished him to understand very clearly that that was my reason—I should prefer to confine my sell to a personal statement. Article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda was meagre, but it was something-something to obtaining which His Majesty's Government had attached importance and on securing which they had been congratulated. I could not conceive any British Government taking a step backward, nor could any British Government do so, even if it contemplated such action, without running nil against a feeling which, even if more latent in the mass of the British public than ft had once been, still pervaded public opinion and found active expression in certain th !ftrfft f t !)J as VJn ny T CaSe 110 ( l u , estion ' so far as I knew, of any revision of the J reaty of Jedda. \\ hen I presented my credentials to Ibn Saud, 1 had referred to it as the mam basis of my position here, and 1 still so regarded it. If the Question of revision came up at a later time, I should not expect to see article 7 abandoned except perhaps, m one set of circumstances, namely, if Ibn Saud had come into international arrangements for the repression of the slave trade to such an extent as to make individual agreements no longer necessary. I told M Sollazzo of the conversation on slavery which I had had with Fuad Bey four days earlier, and which I have recorded in paragraph 7 of my despatch No. 186 of the 23rd July relative to Ibn ^aud s attitude towards the League of Nations. ir ' I'' M.

Royal Slaves : An Incident. „ A 1 f'i 0 ' 1 8 ' 30 011 Sunday morning, the 20th July, the Acting Minister for ■ o reign A flairs rang up to say that the four slaves whom we had manumitted and had that same morning put on board the Italian boat, just due to sail for Massowa were Royal slaves who had recently escaped. He asked me to have them returned at once, under the agreement on this subject, and added that the ship would not be aJlowed to sail until the slaves were taken off her. 2. I expressed surprise and incredulity, but said that I would at once investigate and ring him up again shortly. As T rang off, M. Sollazzo came in (somewhat grimly) and said that Fuad Bey had rung him up to say that the Italian boat could not sail until four slaves put on board by us were debarked He had replied that the slaves having been handed over by us, could onlv be returned to us and at our request. He asked me to let him know in writino- if we wanted them so ietui ned and also asked what he should do if the authorities tried bv force to detain the ship, which was due to sail shortly. I said that I had just that moment -Teen speaking to l uad Bey and was on the point of investigating the case. I thought !i V i ,S i i • but would let him know the result as soon as possible I also thanked him for his loyalty to us. He then left. 3. Mr. Thacker had. meanwhile, examined the manumission file and prepared or me a resume of the particulars of the four slaves in question. Two had taken retuge here seven weeks before (2nd June), one over a fortnight (4th Julv) and the fourth more than a week before (11th July). They had been questioned by Ismail Kffendi and further examined by Munshi Ihsanullah, and had given, apparentlv satisfactory evidence as to the identity of their former masters. None of the slaves seemed to heave any connexion with the Royal Household. We had been unable to get them away earlier owing to lack of shipping facilities to Massowa 4 - } therefore rang up Fuad 'Bey to give him these results, stressing the different and considerable lengths of time these slaves had been here and givinc vhe reasons why He asked for the names of their supposed masters, which I o-avS him. He agreed that they could not be the slaves he sought, who had escaped tliree or tour days ago, but added he would ring up again shortly. f f T1 lt A ? t j ng . Govern ? r , of Jedda then oanie ' n (somewhat pallid) and beo-an to ask for the debarkation of the four slaves. I explained that I was on the 'phone to tuad Bey about them and that there had evidently been a mistake. Fnad Bev just then rang up again to say that three of the slaves 'were clearly not Roval slaves but that the faurth, Mubarek. who had fled from Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's house' was really the King s property, having been given to His Majesty bv a previous owner, and had been placed by the King in his Finance Minister's hands Fuad Bey did not demand his return, but asked His Majesty's Minister to consider the position and return the slave if he thought right. ' ■—v,,, 1 ;l '* ed Fuad Bey to tell the Acting Governor, who was still in my office --x ;lt , e . uwtter was settled as far as the local authorities were concerned He did S0 V. a : 1 l, lr l my i l ,r ^f e •! heikh A t ,dul ran! ? U P th e Officer Commanding, Jedda and told him that the ship was free to leave. 7. After due consideration, Sir Andrew Ryan rang up Fuad Bev and told him that, in view of the facts that {a) there had been no secret about this slave havino- taken refuge here, (ft) he had been here seven weeks: (c) the local authorities them' selves had a fortnight ago issued the necessary pass for his embarkation for Massowa; (d) it was now almost too late to entertain any objection—the eleventh hour m fact , and (. removal of the slave from an Italian ship on which he was already embarked could only risk provoking international comment—in view of these considerations Sir Andrew could only have the slave debarked if he were himself fully covered by a formal promise to supply him with an official certificate declaring this slave to be the King s property. If such a promise were given he would keen the slave here pending telegraphic reference to the Foreign Office, which Sir Andrew telt to be essential in a case which had become invested with such a verv Deculiar character. While declaring his willingness to take these steps out of consideration for the King, Sir Andrew urged that m His Majesty's own interests he should notj be forced to take them, concluding with references to his recent conversation with Fnad Bey on the subject of slavery, the widespread comment that might well be caused, the feeling in Europe, e.g., Rome and Geneva, British public opinion, possible and very unfortunate odium which the King might incur, &amp;c. 8. Fuad Bey asked for time to consider the matter and consult the King, and said .hte would ring up later. He did so in half an hour, to say that, in view of all the circumstances, the King agreed that the best course would be to let the slave proceed. On ringing up M. Sollazzo, I found that Fuad Bey had already told him that the matter was closed. C. G. H.-G. July 22, 1930. n othis document is the property of his britannic majesty 's government.

(No. 218.) ^ ^ lr &gt; Jedda, August 11, 1930. IX my despatch No. 184 of the 28th June I recorded a personal conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the conditions governing diplomatic work in this country. One of my various reasons for choosing the moment of that conversation for a strong expression of views was that since the King went to Taif he was known to have been giving much of his time to questions of reorganisation of the administration of the Hejaz as well as to the revision of legis lation. Comparatively little information had, however, been made public regarding his new administrative plans except as regards changes in the personnel of various departments, like Customs, municipalities, law courts, and certain committees, matters of considerable local interest, but not important enough to record in a despatch. 2. \\hen Fuad Bey came back to Jedda early in August he himself returned to the subject of arrangements for foreign affairs/ He told me on the 3rd August, by way of a personal though not very confidential statement, that the long-talked-of decision to make the Amir Faisal Minfster for Foreign Affairs had been definitely taken. He, Fuad, would remain as second-in-command. The Ministry would be really organised in four sections as soon as men could be found to act as their heads. When they were complete, the heads of sections responsible for relations with the foreign missions would be either resident or constantly accessible in Jedda, it was not clear which. He himself would carry on the Jedda work until this could be arranged. The reorganisation would soon be publicly announced. 3. I welcomed this statement, provided it did not mean that I should be thrown back on heads of sections for the handling of important affairs. Fuad Bey reassured me on this point, and said that he expected to play much the same role vis-a-vis of the foreign representatives as before. I said that, as a personal matter, I should have preferred not to have had another intermediary besides himself between me and the King. 4. On this Fuad Bey made the most interesting part of his statement. The King, he said, was over-tired. He was at last listening to 'his doctors and trying to ease off, with a view to being able to reign rather than to rule. It was therefore proposed to delegate extensive powers to the Amir Faisal, who is to remain Viceroy of the Hejaz, and who will now take over much of the King's work in respect of foreign affairs. 5. It is hardly credible that Ibn Saud, masterful and restless as he is, should abdicate so much of his real power as the foregoing suggests, but it will be interesting to see what balance is achieved under the new arrangements. 6. It had already been announced in the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 18th July that one of the decisions taken during the recent conferences was to constitute in the Diwan a political department under Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. I asked Fuad Bey whether this new department would also be concerned with foreign affairs. He replied that it was being created to provide a single channel in the King's Palace system, through which matters dealt with in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would pass. This is as it may be, but it is obvious that Yusuf Yasin will be in a strong position to ventilate his views, especially as Ibn Saud probably reposes more trust in him than in Fuad Hamza, to whom he probably clings more because of his utility and undoubted ability than because he has complete confidence in him. I consider it an exaggeration to regard Yusuf Yasin and Fuad as so closely united in what has been called the ' Syrian group ' as to see eye to eye on all matters, and Ibn Saud might well use the former as a check on the latter.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 242 of the 17th July on the subject of Ibn Saud and the Yemen, I have the honour to report that the last issue of the ' Umm-al-Qura ' contains a dementi of news published in the Cairo ' Ahram ' of the 1st August from its correspondent at San'a to the effect that Ibn Saud would shortly be mobilising an army to conquer the Yemen, and that an advance guard had alreaav reached Jizan. 2. The denial takes the form of stating that, well-informed sources having been sought as to whether this news was true, it was learned that it is false and groundless. In view of the official character of the ' Umm-al-Qura,' this dementi may be regarded as official. 3. I hope to be in a position to report later on the reorganisation of Hejaz-Nejd forces which is now contemplated and on the distribution of the large supply of arms and ammunition expected in steamship ' Cracow.' It would, I think, be of more than passing interest to know whether and how they were paid for in Poland, as Ibn Saud's financial position has until recently been supposed to preclude the possibility of such extensive and expensive purchases.

My dear Ceoil, I enclose a oopy of a letter of introduction whioh I have given to Sheikh Abderrahman Q,usaibi who hopes shortly to visit England via Palestine, As you probably know, the ^usaibi people are not only the chief pearl merchants of the Persian Gulf, but they are also the chief financiers of Ibn Saud's regime. Sheikh Abderrahman 1 s visit will probably coincide with the arrival in London of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Hejaai Minister to the Court of Saint James. It is conceivable that the visit is being paid with a view to raising the wind for Ibn Saud, whose Treasury is reported, on all hands to be very low. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Andrew Ryan.

I do not know what the practice is in Jeddah, but in the Persian Gulf this title is limited strictly to members of ruling femilies, heads of tribes and religious kazis. The ^usaibi family are of course merely merchants andbelieve^of somewhat lowly extraction, and are therefore not entitled to this honorific at all. x hope therefore that if at any time you have occasion to refer, for instance, to Abdul Aziz qusaibi, Ibn Saud f s representative in Bahrain, he will not be referred to as 'bhaikh% The family have on several occasions been rather a thorn in our side at Bahrain and if they start arrogating to themselves this title of 'Shaikh', it would, I think, give considerable umbrage to the Shaikh of Bahrain and tend to increase their prestige, a thing which I am anxious to avoid.

The conclusion of treaties with Germany, Turkey and Persia. 3. The meeting of King Ibn Saud with King Feisal in the Persian Gulf, which laid the foundations of a settlement of past difficulties between this country and Iraq and opens up a hopeful view of the future. 4. The raising by foreign Powers of the rank of their representatives at Jedda to that of Minister. 5. The establishment of a Hejaz-Nejd Legation in London. II.— Domestic Affairs. 1. Royal opening of the new Legislative Council. 2. Defeat of rebels, restoration of complete internal order and reorganisation of the police. 3. Reformation of Government departments and constitution of an inspectorate of departments. 4. Improvements of facilities for pilgrims and constitution of a pilgrimage committee. 5. Increase in the number of schools and of scholars sent to study in Egypt. (5. Establishment of a Government motor repair shop and of the ' Kiswa ' carpet factory at Mecca. 7.

Publication and free distribution of a work on agriculture, written by a prominent Medina landowner. 9. Reorganisation of the army and purchase of aeroplanes and new war material. 10. Organisation of a motor postal service, erection of new telephone lines, preparation of a scheme of wireless communication. 11. Ratification of agreements concluded at the London Postal Congress of 1929. 12.

I was sorry to hear that you had been ill. xhe title Sheikh as used on this side appears to have practically no honorific significance. It is currently applied to all sorts of officials including quite small fry and, I think, to local notables. In official correspondence emanating from here, it amounts to little more than 'Mr.' Lieut-Colonel H.V. Biscoe, I.A. 1^, n'ar.', though it is more applicable to people of local origin than to others e.g. we used to speak freely of Sheikh Puad Hamza, hut I substituted Bey on finding that he himself considered it more appropriate. thinking as a Syrian he did not seem to consider that 'Sheikh' had a religious flavour aboni, it, ou I doubt whether it means more in this way than perhaps an indication of sound Wahhahism. It is applied correctly, according to our usage, to such minor officials as the assistants to the Governor o f c edda; and soon after I came here I heard that some people spoke of Sheikh Philhy, as a jesting intimation that that gentleman had more or less gone native. It is clear that the use of the title is much more restricted on your side and I will 'bear in applied to Abdurrahman Qusaibi, though we should n a 'ally call him Sheikh here in Jedda as a matter of ordinary politeness, not implying more thanaie waswas a person of aonsideration.

Just at present with Ion Saud. If therefore you think there is a prospect of his coming to Nejd next autumn, I suggest that the matter might be left to me to deal with.

Hafiz Wahba might have been helpful, but Yussuf Yassin is not, very likely to interest himself on the Kuwait side, and in any case, I think Ibn Saud is too personally interested in this matter to be moved except by direct arguments to himself. As regards Abdur Rahman Quasaibi, as you say the term 'Shaikh' is used in a very restricted sense in this part of the world and we in writing to him would address him as n /I HaJ H , or speak to him as 'Haji'.

It may he worth while to record the additional fact that Fuad Bey Hamza, now Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, came down from Mecca specially to receive me on behalt ot the Kins and to present his personal greetings. He met me at the custom-house and delivered cordial messages from Ibn Saud, accompanied by an expression of reg et that he had been compelled to time his departure for Riadh so that it coincided with my arrival. Fuad Bey, who will certainly continue to play the leading role in foreign affairs, especially as regards the maintenance ot relations with foreign representatives, was most effusive in his personal welcome to my wife and myself. 2 Fuad Bey had to return to Mecca the same afternoon as the King was due to leave for Neid that evening and actually started on the morning of the 20th. I have, consequently, had no opportunity of discussing any business with the Under Secretary and am unlikely to see the King himselt for at least two months, possiblv a erood deal longer. -n o i i • i. j 3 The cordiality of my reception shows that Ibn Saud desires to stand well with His Maiesty's Government. Any optimism that I might be tempted to feel is discounted by the prospect of having to deal with various contentious questions and more especially by the blackness of the financial outlook, which is worse ban when I left in August. It is now such that I shall inevitably have to bring strong pressure to bear to procure the settlement of outstanding debts, like that due to the Government of India for arms and ammunition supplied last year, arrears due to the Eastern Telegraph Company in respect of telegrams despatched by the 1 ort Sudan cable and the considerable amounts due to Messrs.

EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 1600/1600/25] Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received March 30.) (No. 80.) Sir, Jedda, March 6, 1931. IN my despatch No. 13 of the 11th January, 1931, I mentioned that the festivities at Wadi Fatma on the 9th January in honour of Ibn Saud's accession included a Nejdi war dance. I did not at the time attach any particular importance to this. It now comes into the same setting as certain more recent manifestations which throw a curious sidelight on the internal situation in this country. 2. The King returned to Mecca for Ramadhan and spent the ensuing festival there. Mecca and Jedda were presently all agog on hearing that the K ing and princes of the Royal house had danced in public during the feast. ShcttJ^kfter, as you know,' Ibn Sand came to Jedda. He arrived on the the principal object of his visit being to gratify the cherished ^.JKion of Mr. Charles R. Crane, a former American Minister and sympathiser with Syrian revolutionaries, to make his acquaintance. This had been engineered partly by Mr. Antonius and perhaps to some extent by Mr. Philby. It was hoped by some'that Mr. Crane might produce a substantial gift or loan. Anyhow, the King was all out to do honour to his guest. 3. Various functions were arranged for the King's stay in Jedda. The Diplomatic Corps were invited to several, as was Mr. Crane. We all dined at the municipality on the King's invitation. We all drank tea with Mr. Philby, whose house His Majesty honoured. But the close of the proceedings was a review on the 27th February held mainly, it would appear, to provide local coloux for Mr. Crane's edification. There was a small march past of the infantry of the ' regular army.' It was followed by a much larger parade of men-at-arms from Nejd who had come back with the King. Ihis was carried out with some show of military order, but it was followed by a dance similar to that given at Wadi Fatma, though on a much larger scale. Many of the Royal princes took part in it. The leader was the King's son, the Kmir leisal, so that the Diplomatic Body enjoyed the unusual spectacle of seeing the Minister for Foreign Affairs execute a public dance in front of them. He was most graceful, and he twirls a sword very prettily. He wore an agreeable smile, though it became a little set as the afternoon wore on—it is said that he collapsed at the end of the similar dance in Mecca. Altogether he showed to infinitely greater advantage than when he is conducting the foreign business of his country . 4. All the participants in the dance were Nejdis. I he infantrymen of the regular army, most of whom came from that country, intimated a wish to join in after they had gone through their new-fangled European tricks. The King graciously accorded permission. Next day it was announced that the people of Jedda had expressed a desire to show what they could do in the way of a display. The King left Mr. Philby's party on the 28th February somewhat early because he had promised to return to the palace for this Jeddawi performance. I understand that it was on the same lines as the Nejdi display, although less formal. After that the habit of making processions to the palace with drums, sino-in'- and dancing appeared to grow on the people of Jedda and there were two oAhree demonstrations .of the kind during the remainder of the King's stay, including one on the 3rd March, when the lead was said to have been taken by the Hadramis, and several gay parties running to many hundred people in all surered past my house on their way back from the palace, 5 On the 2nd March Mr. Philby gave me his version of the dancing at Mecca. It began more or less by accident, he said. On the first day of the festival a crowd of Meccans made a popular demonstration before the palace there It was doubtful how the King would take it—a question whether he would say, as it were: 44 Off with their heads! ' or 'On with the dance! ' The King was in a good humour and received the demonstration graciously. [121 gg—1] / IThen his Nejdis said : ' Let us have our national dancing too, and the Iving assented. When he saw it he was so carried away that he himself joined in. It was a brave sight, said Mr. Philby, to see how the others clustered round until the King was the centre of a thousand men or so, each with his sword in the air. Sword-play, the firing of guns and pistols and the beating of drums are a feature of all these dances. 6. The Mecca 44 Umm-al-Qura' of the 27th February records the performance at Mecca in an article headed : ' The Speech of the Sword. It makes no mention of anything having happened on the first day of the festival, but says that on the second the King held a review of his Bedouin troops, in which the princes joined; and that the King threw off his cloak, drew his sword and played with it too, ' remembering the old days of his fights.' The writer describes this sword-play as a voiceless speech, because every glance and gesture of the King meant many things. 7. The King himself mentioned in my hearing at one of the functions in Jedda that the Nejdi war-dance was a revival, the custom having been in abeyance for over fifteen years. Mr. Philby s version of the Mecca demonstrations ignores the fact that there had been an organised dance at Wadi Fatma on the 9th January, but he too says that these things are the revival of an old practice, and he puts the period of discontinuance at about twenty yea^^ This brings me to my reason for describing at such length in an official ^pypatch what so far reads merely like a record of the picturesque. 8. Ibn Saud started the organisation of the Akhwan colonies round about 1912. They were clearly designed to provide easily mobilisable fighting forces, fanned by zeal by the present Wahhabi doctrine. The rebels of 1929 turned a portion of this instrument against the King. It is difficult to judge how far the revolt permanently in^paired the value of the Akhwan as a military machine, but one of the complaints of the rebels was that the King had ceased to be a good Wahhabi. This is true to the extent that, as he has risen, he has had to make many compromises with modern progress and some with less rigid forms of Islam. One sees in his toleration and encouragement of the recent manifestations an indication of his desire to ride on a looser rein a section of his subjects who like things repugnant to the true Wahhabi of the old school—the music of the drum, for instance. Although this new liberty has been allowed to both Nejdis and Hejazis, it is significant that the easing of the safety valve has taken place in Mecca and Jedda, places with no real appetite for Wahhabism in any form. The King would appear to be reinsuring with the less puritanical elements. His personal participation and that of the princes in the dancing have enabled him to appear as a monarch wlho not only likes to see his people have a bit of fun, but is democratic enough to join in it. 9. Townsmen count for little in this country, and it would be a mistake to attach a greater political significance to the matter than I have done in the preceding paragraph. The spectacle of the dancing crowd outside my house on the 3rd March conjured up the atmosphere of expansiveness characteristic of the cheerfuller phases of European revolutions which have ended in the downfall of Kings; but I should be slow to suggest that Ibn Saud's complaisance denotes, in an Arabian setting, any consciousness of a serious weakening in his position. 10.

(No. 137.) 7 Sir, Foreign Office, April 8, 1931. \ OU recorded in your despatch No. 186 of the 23rd July, 1930, the substance of conversations with the Hejazi Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs respecting the possibility of the Hejaz-Nejd entering the League of Nations, and this question has since been examined in all its aspects, as a result of your discussions with members of my department during your visit to London in October of last rT year- 2. 1 recognise that from considerations of local expediency there are certain important arguments which might be adduced in favour of the Hejaz-Nejd becoming a member of the League. It could be pointed out that membership of the League might conceivably lead the Hejazi Government to adopt a policy of co-operation with other countries in regard to various matters of international concern; and that the participation of the Hejaz and Nejd in the normal activities of the League would be of special value in connexion with such matters as the development of international communications (more particularly by air) and of international health control, although it may be doubted whether British interests would be best served by laying stress on the international aspect of the Arabian air route and of the sanitary control of the Mecca Pilgrimage. An argument of greater weight is perhaps to be found in the possible effect of the admission of Ibn Saud's territories to the League on the relations between the Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq. Since Iraq appears likely to become a member of the League in 1932, it would no doubt be to the good that the Hejaz-Nejd should thenceforward be on a similar international footing, and the fact 'that both countries had undertaken the common obligations incumbent upon members of the League might conceivably facilitate the settlement of possible future disputes between them. 3. From the point of view of the League of Nations itself, on the other hand, it is not clear that that body would necessarily be strengthened bv the admission to membership of a country where conditions are so primitive as to make it difficult, if not impossible, for it to participate at present in general measures for furthering the cause of civilisation. The activities of the League in such fields as the suppression of slavery are already somewhat weakened by the presence in the League of certain countries in which slavery exists, such as Abyssinia, whose influence is occasionally exercised against progressive measures. For this reason, an application for membership of the League by the Hejaz-Nejd might not be welcomed by all members of the League. 4. The position in regard to slavery in the Hejaz and Neid might, in fact, give rise to serious difficulty if an application on the part of Ibn'Saud to be admitted to membership were to come before the League. The existence of domestic slavery in the Hejaz-Nejd, the apparent absence of any intention on the part of the Government to suppress it, and the difficulties King Ibn Saud is understood to be raising to the inclusion of anti-slavery provisions in the treaties under negotiation with Italy and France might perhaps be regarded as evidence that the Hejaz-Nejd is not at present in a position to undertake the obligations devolving from article 23 of the Covenant, even though similar difficulties may have been surmounted or ignored in certain other cases. If His Majesty's Government were too active to encourage King Ibn Saud to seek admission to the League, they might thus find themselves in an invidious position, if such difficulties were raised at Geneva, and the King might hold them responsible for any rebuff which he might eventually encounter as a consequence of compliance with their advice. 5. Further, the League of Nations, m considering an application for membership, requires to be satisfied that the applicant State possesses established frontiers. In view of the fact that Asir is now considered by Kino' Ibn Saud [88 h—1] K H 1 ' Hi- • 18/s/V Nriutr. i i&gt;'' n-:uu.ii)o April 8, 1931, Section 1.as a part of his dominions, difficulty might arise from the undefined nature of the frontier between Asir and the Yemen. It is possible, too, that the question of the frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan, which is only provisionally disposed of by the exchange of notes on this subject attached to the Treaty of Jedda, might arise in this connexion. There would be some inconvenience in the discussion of either of these questions at Geneva at the present time. 6. I now turn to the legal aspect of the question, on which J understand that the Hejazi Government have invited the views of His Majesty's Government. The main point to be considered in this connexion is the fact that the Hejaz is already included in the annex of the Covenant of the League of Nations as one of the ' original members of the League of Nations signatories of the Treaty of Peace ' and therefore comes within the words of article 1 of the Covenant:— ' The original members of the League of Nations shall be those of the signatories which are named in the annex to this Covenant.' 7. It is clear, however, that the mere inclusion of the name of a State in the annex does not, by itself, make that State a member of the League, because there must be, on the part of the State, some act undertaking the obligations of the Covenant, and, in the case of those States enumerated in the first part of the annex, this act is the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, which contains the Covenant. The question is therefore, in the first place, whether the Hejaz could now, by ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, ipso facto become a member of the League. The answer depends upon the effect of the events which have taken place since the signature of the Treaty of Versailles by plenipotentiaries of ex-Km^ Hussein, and the question appears really to turn on the point whether the Hejaz still exists to-day as the same international unit which it was in 1919. It is clear that the mere fact that the former reigning dynasty has been deposed and replaced by another does not, in itself, affect the continuance of the Hejaz as the same international unit, any more than in other cases a revolutionary change of regime in a State involves the extinction of the former State and the creation of a new one. In the present case, however, something more has occurred. The present ruler of the Hejaz is also ruler of Nejd, and was ruler of Nejd before he became ruler of the Hejaz, and the question of the precise character of the union of the two States under his rule is therefore of decisive importance. 8. You will have observed that, in a reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 3rd April, 1930, of which a copy was forwarded to you under cover of my des})atch No. 103 of the 9th April, 1930, I stated that the Kingdoms of the Hejaz and of Nejd are recognised by His Majesty's Government as separate sovereign States under one ruler. King Abd-el-Aziz-bin-Saud. The form of this reply might suggest, though it does not necessarily imply, that His Majesty's Government regard the Hejaz and Nejd as being two entirely separate States in international law, united only in a personal union by reason of the fact that they have a common King. If this were the case—that is to say, if the Hejaz and Nejd formed only what is known as a ' personal union '—then it might be true to say that the Hejaz continues as the same international unit, and could now ratify the Treaty of Versailles and claim to become a member of the League of Nations by that means. King Ibn Sand might in this way not only make the Hejaz a separate member of the League of Nations, but could also apply later for separate membership in respect of Nejd. Various inconveniences would / however, arise. By ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, King Ibn Saud would become a party to the treaty for all purposes, a result which might even produce complications in connexion, for instance, with such subjects as that of German reparations. Moreover, it might be asked by other parties to the Treaty of Versailles whether the deposit of a ratification of the treaty more than ten years after it had come into force was now permissible, at any rate without the consent of the other contracting Powers. 9. Although it might be possible, in support of the foregoing view, to adduce the declaration made by King Ibn Saud himself at the time of his election as King of the Heiaz that the administration of the Hejaz would be kept separate from that of Neja (see Mr. Jordan's telegram No. 6 of the 11th January, 1926), this view does not appear to His Majesty's Government to be the correct legal interpretation of the situation. While it is both theoretically and practicallypossible for two countries which have democratic parliamentary institutions, and in which the King is a constitutional monarch, to keep their separate international status in spite of having a common King, and to contend that they remain in international law two entirely separate units, as in the case of the former union of England and Hanover, it seems difficult to contend that this can be the case where the common King is not a constitutional monarch, but virtually —as is King Ibn Saud—an autocrat, who is himself the Government of the country. In these circumstances a common King involves also virtually a common Government even if, for purposes of administration, &amp;c., the two countries are kept more or less distinct. The relationship of the Hejaz and Nejd under the present regime appears to be much more in the nature of a ' real union,'such as that of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, than in thenatureof a ' personal union.'' This impression is confirmed by the manner in which the foreign affairs of the two countries are conducted. They have only one Foreign Office and one Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the recent treaties of King Ibn Saud are not signed by him in duplicate, one as King of the Hejaz and another as King of Nejd, but are signed by him as King of the Hejaz and Nejd. 10. In the circumstances the exact relationship between the two countries may fairly be said to be known only to Ibn Saud himself. For the reasons given above, however. His Majesty's Government consider that, for the present purpose, the Hejaz and Nejd should be regarded as a single State. It follows that in international law both the Hejaz and Nejd have disappeared as separate international units, and a new unit, consisting of the union, has taken their place. If this is so, then it would be no longer possible for the Hejaz to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, because the former State of the Hejaz has really ceased to exist; and it would be impossible for the Hejaz separately to become a member of the League of Nations, because it does not exist as a separate State. The only way, then, in which the Hejaz and Nejd could obtain membership of the League of Nations would be to apply for it and be elected under the second paragraph of article 1 of the Covenant, and the new member would be the joint Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd. 11. I would point out, in order to avoid misunderstanding, that the creation of a new State out of two formerly separate States united in a real union does not, under the principles of State succession, involve the extinction of all the international obligations of the two component States. The foregoing view of the present status of the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd does not therefore imply that King Ibn Saud is entitled to ignore the obligations previously contracted by the Hejaz and Nejd when they were separate international units. 12. Should the Hejazi authorities again approach you in regard to the question of the admission of the Hejaz and Nejd to membership of the League of Nations, you may explain to them the legal situation, as described in paragraphs 9 and 10 of this despatch, and may discuss the question generally with them in the light of the considerations set forth above. 13. All these considerations are, however, subordinate to the general principle that His Majesty's Government desire to see membership of the League of Nations as nearly universal as possible. They cannot, consistently with this principle, do anything to dissuade a State which is now outside the League but wishes to come in from applying for membership. If, therefore, the Hejazi Government express such a wish, you should say that His Majesty's Government welcome their decision and will support their candidature at Geneva. I am, &amp;c.

Section 1. No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received April 21.) (No. 108.) Sir, Jedda, March 23, 1931. I HAD occasion in a recent despatch regarding the situation between tiie Eastern Telegraph Company and the Hejazi Government to refer to the exchange crisis in this country in February. Being now able to give a somewhat clearer view, I think it may be useful to sum up all the facts known to me in a separate despatch. 2. As you are aware, the currency system of this country rests on a double basis, the English gold sovereign and the silver riyal, the equivalence of which is legally fixed at 10 rivals to the £ sterling. There is a large floating supply of gold and the face value of riyals in circulation is estimated at from £150,000 to £180,000. The value of silver in the riyal is said to be about -/10 at present prices. It is reckoned for accountancy purposes into 11 piastres miri, which do not exist as actual currency, the base metal coinage consisting of nickel piastres, which are theoretically worth 22 to the riyal or 220 to the £ sterling, but are always somewhat depreciated in the market. The currency thus consists of gold pounds, silver riyals and fractions thereof and the nickel piastre and its fractions, one of which, the quarter-piastre, is known as halala. I should explain that the use of this currency is general in the Hejaz proper and that the circulation of Maria Theresa dollars is negligible, although they remain, I understand, the principal currency elsewhere in Ibn Sand's dominions, including Asir. 3. Some weeks ago the riyal broke away from the sovereign and went down to 13 or even lower in a panicky market, halalas following suit. The Govern ment, who at times are large holders of gold, appeared to be running short of it. The local market was depressed owing to general conditions and the prospect of a much diminished pilgrimage. Customs dues were raised considerably on staple articles, as reported in my despatch No. O.T. 9 of the 8th March to the Department of Overseas Trade. 4. All these causes doubtless contributed to the slump in riyals, although I have not sufficient expert knowledge to judge of the effect of particular factors nor do I know what quantity of riyals is required for the normal business of the country. The Government were forced to take the situation in hand, and an attempt was made to restore the riyal by a proclamation, which in Jedda was disseminated late one evening by that picturesque survival, the town crier. The Government action produced its effect, but it was said that the riyal still passed surreptitiously at a depreciated price. AVhen the King came to Jedda on the 25th February, conferences were held between the authorities, bankers and merchants. It was decided to enforce the law stringently and to bolster up the riyal by prohibiting the exportation of gold. The Government expressed readiness themselves to accept riyals for all purposes at 10 to the £ sterling, and enioined this on evervone else. They secured the support of the Nederlandische Handel Maatschappij (Netherlands Trading Society), which undertook to take riyals at the official rate, plus a small supplement in payment foi drafts. TLe only other banking firm in Jedda, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), took up a more conservative attitude and declined to commit themselves, although they are in fact dealing at the official rate up to a limit. ^ 5. I enclose a translation of a communique issued in the c£ Umm-al-Qura'' of the 6th March.(*) The same number of the paper had a leading article attributing the crisis to the fraudulent manoeuvres of speculators, denying that there has been any real crisis at all and describing the action of the Government. 6. ' The measures taken have produced stability for the time being, the riyal being pegged at 10 to export-prohibited gold. The effect has been not to rehabilitate the riyal so much as to bring gold down to its level. In view of the poor pilgrimage prospects, it is difficult to see what the outcome will be in a ( 1 ) Not printed. [88 x—1]country with no export trade and little capacity in the highest places for any form of earning other than that of postponing, where possible, the payment of debts. It is to be supposed that the level of prices will rise. The action of the Dutch Bank has been of material assistance to the Government, but it is not clear on what basis that action rests. When he embarked on it, the manager, Mr. Jacobs, appeared to be confident and to think that the llejaz was good for any amount up to the total value of riyals in circulation. He professed to rely on the honour of the Government and thus found common ground with Mr. Philby, who in one conversation suggested that anyone who did not share this simple faith might as well give up trying to do business here. 7. Mr. Jacobs seems to be a pretty astute financier and had no doubt some more solid basis to work on. On the face of it his bank make six halalas per £ or about l^d. at par on every draft they sell, and they also charge a commission of 1 per cent. As they are in effect lending gold or its equivalent abroad on * the security of riyals, the value to them of these two profits would appear to depend not only on the eventual solvency of the Government, but on the length of time for which they have to carry any rivals not required for current business. They doubtless have some redemption arrangement, but I have been unable lo ascertain its exact nature. It is within my knowledge that on the 3rd March the Minister of Finance produced a certain quantity of gold for this purpose. Mv latest information at the time of writing is that Mr. Jacobs is not as well satisfied as he was three weeks ago. He told a member of my staff on the 22nd March that he would get out of the arrangement if he could. 8. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I nave, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to state that Sheikh Yussuf Yasin called on me on the 1st April to talk over privately the general state of the relations between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Sand. He had proposed this visit, without indicating its object, at the end of a personal letter informing me of the settlement of the question of the arrears due to the Eastern Telegraph Company. hen he came, he explained that he had hung his request to see me on to that matter, because there was a connexion between it and the much more general purpose he now had in view. He had thought of putting what he had to say in writing, but the King had preferred that he should do it by word of mouth. 2. The sheikh expatiated, in the kind of language to which we are accustomed, on Ibn Sand's desire for sincere friendship with and his reliance on Great Britain. From a general statement, of which this was the padding, I extracted four points, which, after hearing it, I enumer^ed for the purposes of my reply. They were as follows : — (1) The King and his Government had of late been reduced to a state of per plexity by the severe attitude in the recent past of His Majesty's Government and myself. They were anxious lest this attitude should reflect a change of policy towards this country. (2) The severity in question had been exhibited more particularly in connexion with the Transjordan frontier question. (In this part of his statement, the sheikh spoke of the frontier question as one in which his Government regarded themselves as being the injured party.) (3) Similar severity had marked my representations in connexion with the Eastern Telegraph Company claim. (4) The sheikh hinted, rather than said, that my own recent language had been peculiarly stiff and rigorous and had contributed to the disquietude of the King and the Hejazi Government. 3. I replied at considerable length to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, thinking that it would be useful to speak to him candidly, though temperately, provided I confined myself to personal expressions of opinion. The general tenor of the conversation was more important than its details and it is therefore unnecessary to record what passed, except in brief outline. 4. Having isolated Sheikh Yussuf's points as above, I took them in reverse order. I explained my personal position as being that of a Minister w T ho had been appointed here in rather unusual circumstances in order to promote the growth of good relations already existing. I had held in agreement with the King and Fuad Bey Hamza that frankness, even if it sometimes entailed disagreeably strong language, was the best diplomacy. If my methods led to the failure of my efforts, I should not shrink particularly from being relieved of a post which had its disadvantages, despite my interest in my work and the kindness which I had received. 5. Turning to particular questions, I reminded Sheikh Yussuf that I had discussed many questions of importance since the beginning of February, and that the two he had named were the only two which had given rise to serious trouble. The others had not all been settled, but some of them had been disposed of and the rest were following a normal course. 6. I had, I said, taken a strong line on the question of the Eastern Telegraph Company, simply because it had gone on for years and had become a scandal, owing to the failure of the Hejazi Postal Administration to carry out its obligations under the agreement. 7. I recapitulated the history of the Transjordan frontier question through out the period during which I had dealt with it. My ultimate conversation with [88 ff—4]Sheikh Yussuf Yasin early in February had been fairly satisfactory. Just about that time, however, His Majesty's Government had been strongly impressed by a report from Captain Glubb, whose views were endorsed by all other competent observers in Transjordan. They considered it necessary to make the strongest possible representations and after mature consideration of every material tactor, including my latest conversation, they had decided that it was imperative to take a strong line 8. &amp; I told Sheikh Yussuf that I was a talkative man. He would have noticed that, except for two passing references, I had kept complete silence on this question since my audience on the 2nd March, ihe reason tor that was that His Majesty's Government were themselves dealing with the matter. I had no authority to discuss it further. If I were to express my personal opinion, it would be that the recent communications from the Hejazi Government had been unsatisfactory. The matter was, however, out of my hands and I could not say what its outcome would be. 9. I then took Sheikh Yussuf's first point. I said that there was no general change in His Majesty's Government towards Ibn Sand. Nevertheless, particular questions might affect the relations of States, if they were of sufficient importance. The Eastern Telegraph Company question was not of that importance. The Transjordan question might be. Even so, it was the practice of His Majest} s Government to deal as far as possible with all questions, even the most important, on their individual merits. They had not, for instance, allowed the iransjoi dan question to stand in the way of Nuri Pasha's visit as they might have done even though thev were no longer directly concerned in the negotiations for which he was coming'. They had, like the Hejazi Government, given no publicity to the existence of an acute controversy. Had they let it be known, Ibn Sand might have sustained damage, e.g., it would have affected the Indian pilgrimage, the only element in the whole of this year's pilgrimage which seemed likely to be up to last year's strength. 10! As for myself, I said, I had continued to discuss other questions which were already in hand. The only change 1 had made was that I had delayed certain communications pending a settlement of the one capital question. I had been at pains to avoid any fresh cause of quarrel, e.g., I had in one case acted with great restraint over a new non-political question, that of the Government chauffeurs. We then had some conversation on that subject, on which 1 have reported separately. 11. My main object throughout this conversation was to impress Sheikh Yussuf with the extreme importance of the Transjordan frontier question, without involving myself in any discussion of its recent phases. Though perturbed over it, he gave me the impression of thinking that it had ceased to be acute, as, for instance, when he said that he had waited until things were easier to make his general communication. When he was leaving I asked him to convey my respects to the King and to assure His Majesty that I was always striving for a good understanding; but I added that there was one cloud, and that that cloud had not been dispersed. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's High Commis sioners at Jerusalem and Bagdad and to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 19 of the 2nd February, I have the honour to state that Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Jedda on the 13th April and informed me by a personal letter of the 15th A.pi il that hp had tosuiiiec is duties, i.e., those of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. 2 Although Fuad Bey's illness in December and January was undoubtedly o-enuine, many people thought him unlikely to return to the Hejaz. Now that he has come back, it remains to be seen what balance will be establisned between him and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, whose position with the King is strong and who has since the beginning of February been thrust into close contact with the foreign representatives. It will also be interesting to see how much of his time Fuad Bey will spend in Jedda, either as a visiting representative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or as head of a properly-organised local branch of the Ministrv. 3^ It has been evident during the last two or three months that the Emir Feisal himself plays no effective role as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Ho does not appear to have had anything to do with the recent negotiations with Iraq except when texts had to be signed. I doubt whether he has even followed the correspondence about Transjordan. On one occasion when I suggested to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that certain British-protected persons on whose bexialt 1 had made oral representations to him had been rebuked by the Hejazi Govern ment for appealing to the Legation, he said that there could be no connexion because onlv he, the King, my interpreter and myself had had knowledge of our conversation. It did not occur to the sheikh to include in his list the Minister whose Acting Under-Secretary he theoretically was at the time. 4.

Secret.) •Sir, Jedda, May 28, 1931. 1 HA\ E had occasion in various recent reports to refer to various indications of a weakening of Ibn Sand s position in this country. Although the available data are meagre and uncertain, I think the time has come to attempt a review of the King s situation on the eve of an absence from the Hejaz which may last several months, if he carries out his intention of going to Nejd, as reported in mv telegram No. 141 of the 20th May. 2. Ibn Saud imposed himself on the Hejaz by force of arms. He maintains himself by force of personality and by a reserve of material force responding to his personal direction and still capable of being applied with sufficient effect at any particular point to enable him to cope with anything short of a fairly general movement of opposition. Such a movement could hardly originate among the parasitic populations of places like Mecca and Jedda, although their inhabitants would almost certainly welcome a change of regime. The tribes have no such cohesion as to produce of themselves an organised movement in opposition to a King whose name and past exploits inspire respect and fear. 3. So far so good, from Ibn Sand's point of view. Nevertheless, he has to reckon with more remote factors. One hears vaguely, but somewhat persistently, of a restive spirit in the north of the Hejaz. Hail and even Medihia are potential centres of disaffection. Behind them are the Transjordan frontier and countries ruled by members of the Shereefian family, a family which, though eliminated at present from the Hejazi scheme of things, would be the natural rallying centre for elements bold enough to try conclusions with the present regime. Such elements may emerge in the north/even though it be impossible at present to locate or identify them. Their boldness would strike an echo not of equal boldness, but of sympathy, in Mecca and Jedda, where people chafe under restrictions and recent Nejdification.' 4. The King's religious prestige has diminished as his temporal power has grown. He tends to fall between two stools. He is no longer extreme enough for W ahhabis of the old school. He is too AVahhabi for Hejazis and for the majority of alien Moslems who frequent the Hejaz at pilgrimage time. Native and foreign Moslems react on each other to some extent/ The desecration of shrines since the ahhabi invasion is a cause of widespread feeling shared bv foreign pilgrims, who have venerated these from afar, and natives accustomed not only to venerate them, but, in some cases, to make money out of them in the past. 5. There are other factors in this nebulously alarming picture, like economic depression, maladministration, and an almost desperate financial situation. As for economic depression, the Hejaz cannot escape from the repercussion of ' world causes.'' Their effect is manifested in the reduction of the overseas pilgrimage to less than half the numbers for last year. Maladministration is too familiar in a country like this to be in itself a potent cause of discontent. It impresses foreigners more than it is consciously felt by the bulk of the native population. The dangerous feature in connexion with my present subject is not so much the badness of the administration as the quasi-paralvsis which threatens many of those responsible for it, owing to the increasing difficultv of devisino- shifts to get out of difficulties. Mr. Philby, that most charitable of critics when he is dealing with the affairs of this country, dwelt particularly on this aspect of the situation in our last conversation. He convicted the Kin^ himself of floundering, of making mistakes through ignorance, and of clingin^ to authority amid a posse of advisers, all the more capable of whom were worn out with overwork. He remarked on the complete occupation of the Emir Feisal to whom it was thought last autumn that the King might delegate some of his powers [165 z—1]6. The crux of the matter is the financial situation. Ibn Saud has no doubt always lived up to his income and a bit beyond it. 1 he trouble now is that he can only escape the most serious embarrassment by cutting his cloth to lit a greatly diminished income, again because of the slump in the pilgrimage, which has been too great to be balanced by increased taxation, and which is hardly likeh to be repaired next year, whatever later prospects may be. He and his family are naturally extravagant. The expenditure, for instance, on a move to Riadh is enormous in comparison with resources. This extravagance in itself causes adverse comment. The most intelligent foreign pilgrim 1 have met this year remarked on the poorness of the lighting of the sacred precinct at Mecca as contrasted with the installations in royal houses, and was very much inclined to ask generally why Ibn Saud should aftect to miscellaneous State or other purposes money brought by Moslems coming here as of right to fulfil a religious obligation. Royal extravagance in personal expenditure might, however, pass, if royal requirements for other purposes were not so great a drain. The King s strength and prestige must depend on his ability to pay, pay, pay. An Islamised Dutchman here, not hostile to him, has expressed to me doubt as to whether the King means to go to Nejd at all this summer. His doubt is probably unfounded, but his reasons for it are interesting. Custom demands that all who come to the King's threshold in Riadh should receive food, clothing and gifts. What an excellent plan, then, for His Majesty to put it about that he is going thither; let the expectant Bedouin turn their steps in that direction also; retire to Taif; and leave an eldest son to gratify as best he may the hopes of the Bedouins! Mr. Philby again, in the conversation to which T have already referred, asked me, with 'unusual diffidence, what I thought of the financial outlook, and had nothing hopeful to suggest when I said I could not see where any money was to come from until late in the autumn. 7. There is little in this despatch that T have not already adverted to m special connexions in other reports. In putting all the facts together in one statement, I may have painted too gloomy a picture. It is not the first time in Ibn Sand's history that he has % been confronted with difficulties, nor is there anythino- in his record to suggest that he would easily relinquish what he has gained. He has often been bard up, and contrived to carry on. His whole position was endangered by the 1920 rebellion, and he came out on top. My object is not to suggest that he is now on the point of collapse in the Hejaz, but to show that his position here rests on foundations so unstable that a strong push from any direction might upset it, and that his downfall, if it could be compassed, would not be unwelcome to the population, however incapable the most visible elements may be of compassing it themselves. My intelligent pilgrim, admittedly a hostile witness, unlike Mr. Philby and the Dutchman, was full of the King's unpopularity, and mentioned a prophecy, of which I had not previously heard, that Ibn Saud's rule in the Hejaz would last seven years from the start. My French colleague tells me that he hears the same tales as myself- of unsettled feeling in the Northern Hejaz, and agrees with me in thinking that their importance lies more in their persistency than in the value of particular reports. 8. While drafting this despatch I heard that a council of representatives, in some sense elective, has been convened to meet at Mecca on or about the 1st June, to consider matters affecting the general interests of the country. According to mv informant, it will be a considerable gathering, comprising twenty representa tives from Mecca, ten each from Medina and Jedda, and representatives from other towns. This piece of news has an interesting bearing on the subject-matter of the present despatch, which, however, I do not wish to delay. If my informa tion is confirmed, I will report separately anything I may hear regarding the council and its proceedings. prsr £1 g 0.

[E 3463/1600/25] No. 1 Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received July 4.) (No. 217.) Sir. / i Jedda, June 9, 1031. IN paragraph 8 of my despatch No. 200 of the 28th May relative 'to the general situation in this country, I mentioned a report that a council of repre sentatives was to be held at Mecca. J confirmed this in my telegram No. 156 of the 31st May, summing up very briefly the contents of my despatch. I have now the honour to report further on this interesting development. My report is not complete in all particulars, as I wish to forward it by bag to-day, and there has not been time to have all the matter available in the last issue of the 'Umm-al- Qura translated. It will, however, put you in possession of the main facts. That is all that matters at present, for it is too soon in any case to judge of the real importance of the assembly. 2. On the 28th May, after I had drafted my earlier despatch, Fuad Bey Hamza told me that it was formerly the custom to hold consultative assemblies in this country, but that none had been convened in the last two years. The King had now, he said, decided to convoke an elective assembly of representatives of the principal towns to discuss and advise on present problems. Fuad Bey intimated that it would be convened annually and would be in the nature of a constitutional organ. It would sit at Muna, as there was a suitable palace there, and it was desired that the proceedings should be conducted in a tranquil atmosphere. Muna is, as you are aware, a few miles from Mecca on the road to Arafat and is ordinarily heard of only in connexion with the pilgrimage, as it is there that the pilgrims stone the Devil and spend the three days of the festival following Pilgrimage Day. 3. The ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the following day, the 29th May, had a leading article and an announcement that elections had already been held in various towns in accordance with an ordinance of the King. There was nothing to show on what electoral basis the representatives had been or were being selected and the point is still obscure. So far as I am aware no organic regulations have been published. Nevertheless, considerable stress was laid on the elective and popular character of the ' National Conference.' When the well-trained people of Jedda and Medina proceeded to nominate administrative officials their choice was disallowed. It appeared from the ' Umm-al-Qura ' that the King, acting in an Islamic spirit, wished to follow the example of ancient Caliphs and to establish a broader basis than before for consultation with wise and thoughtful men and to give his people an opportunity of ventilating grievances. He made a distinction, the writer explained, between Bedouin and townspeople. The Bedouin come direct to his door, notably at pilgrimage time, and he went into all their claims, complaints and affairs generally. The conference of urban representatives, henceforward to be held annually in Muharram, would enable him to acquaint himself with matters affecting the townspeople. The task of the conference would be, according to the ' Umm-al-Qura's ' information, to study matters of religious law and observance, the means of ensuring justice and reforms in the domain of economic life and general progress. 4. The conference met at Muna on the 2nd June, but that place proved either too hot or too inaccessible, and on the second day the meeting-placfe was changed to Mecca. There the conference has been sitting since and Fuad Bey told me on the 6th June that it might be expected to go on for some time. It is hard to get any information other than that of the ' t^mm-al-Qura '' as to what it is doing exactly. Even Mr. Philby, although he has twice been down from Mecca during the last month, has views rather than news. In his present pessimistic mood, his views are almost cynical, though he is not as cynical as some who suggest that the conference has been assembled with the object of levying contributions on its members. He confesses to ignorance as to what the Government are at, but inclines to think that, having to devise drastic measures [192 d—1]to cope with present difficulties, they have decided on a form of popular consultation, in order to be able to tell the townspeople later that they had their opportunity of making themselves heard. He criticises the arrangements in various particulars, e.g., he says that the conference has been saddled with the secretariat of the permanent Legislative Council, a nominated body with an inept secretarial service, and he hints at possible hanky-panky in connexion with the Mecca ballot-boxes. 5. The '' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 5th June was full of it all. It gives a list of representatives, two being the president of the Legislative Council and another person on behalf of the Government; twenty-two for Mecca; eleven for Jedda; Medina; three each for Taif and Yambo; and ten members of the Legislative Council. 1 understand from other sources, though this is not stated in the paper, that the members include separate representatives of the body of L lama. It also appears that Governors, &amp;c., certainly the Governor of Jedda, are participating in the labours of the conference. It elected its own president, one Sheikh Mohammed-al-Marzuki, and other officers, after the King had opened the proceedings with a speech and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had read the agenda. Three committees were appointed to deal respectively with («) public morals and the control of the pilgrimage; {h) judicial matters; and (c) general affairs. 1 he public have been invited to communicate any useful suggestions in writing to the secretary. On the second day the conference drew up a loyal address in reply to the King s speech. The King gave a banquet on the evening of the first day. 6. It will be observed that several of the most approved parliamentary forms have been observed. Has the Hejaz then become a parliamentary country to the extent that autocracy seeks a lead from the people? Has there been another of those bloodless revolutions in a form adapted to the conditions of the Holy Land ? The answer to both questions is probably in the negative. It would be unfair to Ibn Saud to suggest that it is all eye-wash. He is confronted with many problems. He would certainly like to solve the more urgent of them, e.g., to appease the many complaints connected with the pilgrimage 'and to find a way out of the present financial and economic morass. He may think sincerely that it is a useful thing to seek wisdom even among the people. Whoever actually elected or selected the representatives of Jedda,'for instance, they have not been ill-chosen. But the King will not and dare not part with power; nor can the best available representatives have the necessary knowledge, even if they were given the power, to solve the financial problems which dominate the position. The locomotive is off the rails. The most that can be hoped of such a conference is that it will serve as a safety valve and prevent the boiler from bursting, while the engine muddles its way through the desert under the auspices of the King and his advisers, who still remain really in charge of it. This mechanical illustration reminds me of the one concrete proposal which I have heard of so far in connexion with the problems submitted to the conference. It is that motor-cars should be abolished or severely restricted. The money for them goes out of the country and their increased use tends to destroy established trades. If the camel came back into his own, depression would be relieved. The honourable trade of making camel-litters would, for instance, revive. 7.

Sir A . Ryan to Mr. A . Henderson—{Received May 27.) (No. 162.) T / 7 If a moi ^• r Jedda, May 4, 1931. IN paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 81 of the Oth March, lelative to Mr. C. R. Crane's visit to Jedda, I mentioned an offer which he^ had made to Ibn Sand to arrange for the engineer whom he employs in the \ emen to \ isit this country to look into water possibilities. i rr. • i n \ 2. The engineer in question is a United States citizen named Twitchell, and is engaged on the construction of the new motor road, which is being made undei Mr. Crane's auspices from Hodeida to Sana via Hajaa. He arrived in Jedda on or about the 17th April with his wife, an Englishwoman, and was received by Ibn Saud on the 20th April. Since that date he and Mrs. Twitchell have made two journeys inland. 1 have not been able to discover their range, but doubt whether they have been far from Jedda. 3. On the 24th April the Mecca newspaper ' Umm-al-Qura produced a leading article headed ' Two Great Projects.' J he writer, after rebutting, with the support of a citation from an Italian orientalist, the common belief in the barrenness of the Arabian Peninsula, refers to Ibn Saud s ettorts to improve the country in all directions. He speaks, in particular, of two out of many schemes, namely, the sinking of artesian wells and prospecting for minerals, and says that for the former purposes the King has now brought an expert, who is making experiments in the vicinity of Jedda. Ihis obviously refers to Mr. Twitchell, whose visit is mentioned in the news columns of the same issue of the ' Umm-al-Qura.'' 4. I have little doubt that a systematic survey for water would produce appreciable results in various parts of the country. 1 doubt, however, the King s capacity for directing it with the necessary comprehension and perseverance, and still more his willingness to give any foreign expert a sufficiently free hand to achieve much. As for mining, the prospects are even more nebulous. Until the Umm-al-Qura ' article appeared I had heard of no definite scheme, but when the Commissioner of Port Sudan was visiting here early in March Mr. Philbx told him that the King had decided on a geological survey of the country, with a view, I gathered, to concessions being eventually given subject to suitable safeguards. 5. If Ibn Saud knows little about how to set about applying modern contrivances to the development of latent water resources, he is probably infinitely more ignorant of the difficulties surrounding the location and exploita tion of minerals in a country like this. In my opinion, the chief interest at present of the matters mentioned in this despatch is the indication they afford of an inclination on Ibn Sand's part to explore tentatively possibilities of economic development. However little grasp he may have of the conditions necessary to achieve real success in that direction, he is quite intelligent enough to realise the need for some new basis of prosperity if the country is to hold its own. So far as the Hejaz is concerned, its almost complete dependence on the pilgrimage as its sole industry is a patent source of weakness; and the weakness has never in recent years been so patent as during the present season, which has brought only some '40,000 pilgrims from overseas to Mecca. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the political resident in Aden, who is interested in Mr. Twitchell, and to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.

AS you are aware, it has become the practice of Ibn Saud to give a banquet for Moslem notables of all nations each year at pilgrimage time. This year it took place on the evening of the 24th April, and was attended by a rather unusual number of Moslems of high standing, if in most cases of no great political importance. The King had on his right ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan, and on his left Sheikh Ahmed-es-Senussi. Among others present were Prince Ahmed Tevhid of Turkey, whose visit I have reported separately, the members of Nadir Khan's official delegation, the Afghan Minister in Cairo, Sir Abdul-Kerim Ghuznavi, of the Council of the Governor of Bengal, and various minor notabilities. 2. The King delivered the principal speech of the evening and spoke strongly on one of his favourite subjects, the weakening of Islam by disunion and by the pursuit of false ideals like that of supposing the imitation of Europeans to be the only way to progress. Had any of the exponents of this theory, he asked, succeeded in making a needle, an aeroplane, a rifle or a gun? No; they imitated the Europeans only in those things contrary to Islam. 3. At this point the King took up a reference by an earlier speaker to an utterance of the Indian leader, Shauqat Ali, during his recent tour about our brothers the Jews.' This drew from Ibn Saud a tirade directed not so much against that people as against any idea of fraternity save in Islam, which was, he said, the means of happiness in this world and the next. He swore a triple oath affirming his wish that all peoples should accept Islam, and declared his preference for the life of one eating herbs on a mountain top, and worshipping God, over all earthly grandeur. God, he said, had divided Moslems into two classes, the warriors ever in readiness to defend their religion, and those others engaged in industry, agriculture, &amp;c. He reproached Moslems with their internal strife. Pointing to the Turkish Prince present, he described how his ancestors had fought those of the prince rather than call themselves servants of the ' Commander of the Faithful.'' They were the servants of God only. 4. The King attenuated the militant tone of his speech by saying towards the end that he did not profess to be fighting against the people of the world and used the courtesy prescribed by Islam unless he was injured in his religion and his country. He ended with a call to all Moslems to turn to the service of God and the good way of their forbears. 5. This speech was rendered into Urdu by the Indian Ismail Ghuznavi. Various other speeches were also delivered in the course of the evening, including one in English by Sir Abdul-Kerim Ghuznavi. 6. The above account of the proceedings is based mainly on the authorised report in the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 1st May. Although it gives the King's address as a connected whole, he would appear to have in fact spoken both before and after dinner. I understand from private sources that the guest who indiscreetly quoted Shauqat Ali was an Egyptian. Not all the oratory was, it seems, to the King's taste, and not all the guests were entirely pleased with His Majesty. My informant describes the function as having ended in an atmosphere of tension. One of the speakers who praised the King was Saif-ur-Rahman, who has been mentioned in other reports as having become the spokesman of the official delegation from Kabul on various occasions. It is said that Amanullah Khan also thought of saying something, but thought better of it. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, and also to His Majesty's High Commissioner at Jerusalem, in case Ibn Saud's remarks about the Jews should have any echo in Palestine.

Section 2. /&amp; [E 3024/2064/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received June 10.) (No. 177.) Sir, Jedda, May 15, 1931. SINCE I wrote my despatch No. 108 of the 23rd March, the exchange situation in this country has gone through various vicissitudes, of which it is now possible to give a more or less connected account, although no account by an outsider can be complete or at all points accurate owing to the amazing difficulty of obtaining coherent information in the conditions which prevail. 2. The arrangements with the Dutch Bank, as the Netherlands 1 rading Society is popularly called, worked for five or six weeks on the lines described in my previous despatch, i.e., the bank sold drafts on abroad in exchange for riyals at 10 to the £ sterling, plus a small premium of \\ current piastres, and charged for the draft a high commission, the normal rate of which was at first 1 per cent., but was afterwards raised to 2 per cent. The currency remained fairly fixed at the legal rate of £1 gold sterling to 10 riyals, equalling 220 current nickel piastres. 3. About the middle of April, however, the arrangement with the Dutch Bank broke down, apparently for two reasons, namely, that the Government was working on a limit of £10,000 in gold for redemption purposes and threw back on to the market an excessive quantity of the redeemed silver and nickel. At this stage the Government would appear to have relaxed the prohibition of the export of gold, though I cannot discover that any public announcement was made ; and the bank attempted to carry on by selling drafts for half gold and half silver, &amp;c. This did not last very long, and presently the bank more or less shut down its exchange business. In Jedda it is difficult even to ascertain at any given moment whether a bank is open or closed. 4. In any case, it was now close to the pilgrimage day, which fell on the 27th April, and which put a stop to all big business from a day or two before the actual date of the standing on Arafat until at least five days later. The pilgrims had all arrived before the 25th April, and their advent, naturally, brought money to replenish temporarily the Government chest. The demand for currency for retail operations is also naturally greatest at the height of the pilgrimage. These reasons probably account for the fact that, although the riyal has been wobbly since the middle of April, there has been no spectacular depreciation. It has stood at rates varying from a little over the legal rate of 10 to a rate of 12 to the £ sterling of late. 5. Shortly before the pilgrimage day, on the other hand, the nickel currency broke loose from all standards, and as it plays an important part in retail business great uneasiness prevailed. It was accentuated by the publication of a communique on the 23rd April to the effect that, in view of the frauds which had been practised, the Government had decided to accept nickel at the market rate, which would be announced each morning by the financial authorities. This was followed by a considerable dislocation of retail trade, and. some days later, there was something of a panic in the bazaars of Jedda and Mecca. Piastres went to very low rates, and at one moment all but lost effective value as currency. The Government took stop-gap measures in Jedda to withdraw nickel by collecting supplies of rice, &amp;c., and selling in a shop or shops of their own. I do not know what happened at Mecca, except that prices in piastres went up considerably, much to the discomfiture of pilgrims. 6. A meeting was held in Mecca on the 1st May to consider the whole situation, and a new communique issued in the ' Umm-al-Qura of the 1st May, which actually appeared on the 3rd May, announced that the Government had opened shops to change nickel for riyals at the legal rate of 22 to the riyal. Various other remedies were adopted about the same time, notably an arrange- [165 k—2]ment which amounts to a forced loan raised by the Government, although, in theory, it is supposed to be worked by committees of representative merchants. The principle of this arrangement appears to be to withdraw from circulation £24,000 of nickel, the Government putting up €8,000. the merchants the rest, each of them being assessed at a stated amount. The nickel thus collected was to be held by the Ministry of Finance, and repayment of the money levied on the public was to be made at a later date. It was further decided about the 7th May to close all the shops of the money changers, who are accused of rigging the currency market. 7. The measures taken have rehabilitated nickel for the time being and, as I have said, the riyal has not fallen unduly low. Nevertheless, the situation is obviously precarious, for the crisis has occurred at what should be the period of greatest prosperity. The months between now and the beginning of the next pilgrimage season late in the autumn, when the 1932 pilgrims will begin to arrive, must necessarily be very lean months. The manager of the Dutch Bank was a very disillusioned man towards the end of April, but he was then negotiating a fresh arrangement with the Government. He did not tell me its ■exact nature, but he said that the Government would have to put up £60,000 in gold to back it. After the festival he did not reopen his bank for exchange business, and rumours were afloat that the bank contemplated retirement from the country. On the 10th May, however, Mr. Jacobs told me that he was still negotiating. He no longer had any doubt that the Government could dispose of any necessary 'amount of gold up to £60.000, but he said he was awaiting the King's guarantee of the transaction, whatever it might be. He complained bitterly of the changeableness and incapacity of the Government. He put much of the blame on Mr. Philby, who, he said, had been dangling before the King the idea that it would be an easy matter to arrange, with his (Mr. Philby's) assistance, to introduce another bank, which would give all the help required. 8. The situation is complicated by factors which are even further from my ken than the matters which I have attempted to summarise above in a form more intelligible than most of the reports on which my account is based. There are supposed to be, for instance, some £30,000 worth of nickel coins in circulation, but rumours of inflation by the importation of forged coins have been current and have helped to destroy confidence. Another obscure factor is the difficulty ■of popularising in Nejd the use of the silver and nickel coinage current in the Hejaz. 9. You will doubtless be struck by the smallness of the amounts on which these locally important crises turn. It needs at most, it appears, £60,000 in gold to sustain a silver currency which is legal tender to an unlimited amount. Operations in nickel to a total of £30.000 can throw the market into convulsions. As I have observed in at least one previous report, it is characteristic of this country that the Government are reduced to all sorts of shifts to cope with what, according to our standards, are quite small liabilities. It is not the first time that Ibn Saud has been in low water, but I doubt whether he has ever been so embarrassed or had so little credit. It is just possible that the present financial situation may react on his political future. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c.

(No. 279.) &lt;Si r&lt; JeddcL, July 12, 1931. I REGRET that I have been unable hitherto to follow up my despatcl? No. 217 of the 9th June with a further report' on the Hejazi ' National Conference.' I will now attempt to sum up avS briefly as possible the main points in the accounts given in the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 5th, 12th and 19th June. That newspaper has of late become so garrulous that a severe sifting is necessary. 2. As I stated in my previous despatch, the conference assembled at Muna on the 2nd June, but moved next day to Mecca. It sat until the 11th June, when the King gave another banquet to mark the close of the proceedings and received, after dinner, the report. 3. I have still seen no organic statute of any kind defining the constitutional character and electoral basis of the conference. The f Umm-al-Qura of the 5th June published, however, a regulation determining its internal organisation and the scope of its labours. The most interesting clauses in this are those relative to the three committees mentioned in my previous despatch. 4. The report published in the 4 ' Umm-al-Qura does not describe very precisely the conclusions of the Committee on Public Morals, which also dealt with pilgrimage matters. It merely indicates in general terms that recommenda tions were made as to the means of promoting Islamic morality and that regula tions were .proposed in connexion with the pilgrimage, notably with reference to complaints made against mutawwifs and their agents. The paper states that these recommendations were to be submitted by the King to the ulema and the Legislative Council respectively. 5. The Committee on Judicial Affairs dealt with two main subjects, one apparently having to do with the general iunctioning of the courts, the other \\ith the rapid' and final disposal of all cases now pending in them. The conference adopted a regulation in forty-two articles prepared by the committee under the first of these heads. This also is to be submitted to the ulema. It was suggested that the review of all pending cases should be entrusted to four ulema, whose names were submitted to the King. 6. The Committee on Economic and General Affairs^ is described as having been much the largest of the three committees. The 1 Umm-al-Qura' gives a long, though apparently not complete, list of the subjects which it discussed with a view to their further consideration by the Government. Ihe list is impiessive, but the headings are very general. The subjects include the question whether it is a good thing to have few or many motor cars; the granting of concessions; the employment of experts in finance and agriculture; financial reform generally; banking arrangements, including the possibility of a national bank; the mtio- duction into general use throughout Ibn Saud s dominions of the Hejazi cunency and the gradual elimination of the Maria Iheresa dollar; agricultural develop ment and mining; the despatch of a mission abroad to be trained in economic questions; the creation of an agricultural company and another toi dealing in hides and making yarns; road improvements and railway communications; electric lighting; payment of salaries and inspection ol public departments; wakfs, including efforts to secure the revenue of wakts created abroad for the benefit of the holy places. 7. An impressive list, as I have said, even though 1 have condemned it and omitted some of the items. The ' Umm-al-Qnra suggests the picture of a liiye of happy and intelligent bees engaged in living up to what they themselves said in their address to the King, when commending his goodness in convoking a freely-elected Assembly: 'The nation is made to face a smiling future lull or the dreams of the great ancient Arabs, in this, the time of the gieatest crowned Arab who has appeared in Arabia.' [219 m—2] August 12, 1931 vV l'&gt; 1 M \\ Section 2.8. Accounts from private sources show the conference in a less happy light. It undoubtedly focussed attention on a great many matters of public interest and, if certain of the suggestions put forward were acted on, good would result. r i he questions of mutawwifs, for instance, would appear to have given rise to considerable discussion, and at least one useful proposal seems to have emerged, namely, that they should cease to be used for the purpose of collecting Government taxation (see paragraph 57 of the pilgrimage report for 1930). On the other hand, some of the suggestions made in this connexion might, if adopted, tend to strengthen the hold of the mutawwifs on pilgrims. 9. The most crucial subject of discussion was, however, the financial situa tion. Some of the delegates were apparently bold enough to criticise present methods and to suggest means, including the establishment ot a regular budget, whereby extravagance might be curtailed and the power of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Director-General of Finance, might be curbed, ihe critics seemed to have quarrelled violently with the sheikh and to have incurred the displeasure of the King. It is, indeed, said that this controversy decided His Majesty to make an end of the conference sooner than he might otherwise have done. 10. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the conference did more to make discontent articulate than to solve problems. It emphasised the polarisation between Nejda arrogance and the sense of grievance with which Hejazis see themselves ridden over roughshod while their money is drained out of the country to pay for extravagant purchases abroad and to supply the needs of Nejd. From the point of view of a foreign observer, perhaps the most interesting feature of the proceedings was the tendency, due more, perhaps, to subservience than to conviction in the case of persons other than officials and ulema, to assert Islamic exclusiveness. I am told that some of the pilgrimage questions were approached in the spirit that foreign pilgrims should be discouraged from invoking the assistance of their consular authorities. The view seems to have prevailed that any foreign experts employed should be Moslems and that any concessions granted should also be granted to Moslems. 11. In some ways, indeed, the conference seems to have taken on the character of a Moslem' religious gathering rather than that of a Hejazi national assembly. It is even suggested that it was intended partly as a counter-move to the efforts of the Indian, Shauqat Ali, who is notoriously hostile to Ibn Saud, to brin^ about a general Moslem conference. In this connexion, it is interesting to note^that the Mecca representatives at the National Conference included two Indian notables resident there, Messrs. Abdullah and Obeidullah Dehlavi. According to my principal informant, a proposal was actually mooted that Indians should be given a share in the administration of the country, but was rejected by the King, in accord with his Syrian advisers, owing to the danger of Indians becoming consular tools. 12. I should be sorry to vouch for everything in this hurriedly-written and imperfectly-informed report, but I think that, in the main, it gi\es a tairly 'accurate account of an interesting, though incomprehensive, experiment; interest- ing as a reflex of the state of affairs in this country; inconclusive because Ibn Saud will gang his ain gait, so far as religious, financial and tribal considerations do not restrict his freedom of motion. 18.

Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received August 12.) (No. 280.) Sir, - &gt; Jedda, July 12, 1931. IN my despatch No. 200 of the 28th May I attempted to review the general situation in this country with special reference to the Hejaz as distinct from Nejd and its dependencies. Now that Ibn Saud has gone to Riadh and I myself am about to go on leave, I should like to bring the review up to date. 2. It is generally felt that the King, having concentrated his attention on the affairs of the Hejaz for over a year, his first prolonged stay in this part of his dominions since he completed his conquest of it, has left those affairs in a hopeless mess. It is even suggested by some that he has run away from them. I under stand that the situation has given rise to extravagant rumours abroad, one of them being that His Majesty had decided to abdicate in favour of his son Feisal, presumably in the Hejaz, of which that Prince is Viceroy, or in favour of both his elder sons, Saud and Feisal. A report in the latter sense, published in a Cairo newspaper, was formally contradicted in the Umm-al-Qura ' of the 10th July. 3. The feeling one has at present is a sense, not of greater apparent trouble than in May, but of a lack of central direction. The Hejaz has been left like a waterlogged and half-dismantled ship without any particular signs of a wind to blow it either into port or to destruction. It is hard to say who is governing the country. The King is too far away and probably too fed up not to be glad of a rest from the Hejaz. The young Viceroy has been too much in the background of late to make it possible to judge of his capacity for affairs. Among the 'statesmen' the two most important factors are Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who is strong, and Fuad Bey Hamza, who is active and industrious. It remains to be seen whether this not very happily assorted triumvirate can carry on until next pilgrimage. 4. I can add nothing to what I said in paragraph 3 of my despatch under reference regarding the situation in the interior. There is the same anxiety about it in the towns. The same rumours float about, occasionally perhaps a little more precise, but usually fantastic. In the imagination of the quidnuncs of Mecca and Jedda, Jauf 'falls' periodically, no one knows into whose hands. A recent rumour has filled the lacuna in the case of Tebuk, which was said to have fallen 'to the rebels.' 5. In paragraph 4 of my previous despatch I referred to the King's religious position. There has been an interesting development in this connexion. It became known towards the end of June that he had made concessions to his extremists. He allowed to be published in the ' L mm-al-Qura ' of the 26th June a long remonstrance addressed to him by the IHema of Nejd regarding the repetition this year of the Accession Day celebrations instituted in January 1930. The writers claimed politely but firmly that it was their right and duty to call the King's attention to the irreligiousness of celebrations, which they had condoned in 1930 as there might be political reasons for them, but the perpetuation of which could not be tolerated. The King's reply, which was also published, expressed his delight at being thus counselled. He deferred to the judgment of the.ulema, and asked the forgiveness of God for his offence. 6. About the same time steps were taken to tighten up the regulations against vicious practices, like abstention from prayer, the public use or sale of tobacco (the importation of which is nevertheless still tolerated) and the use of gramophones, &amp;c. These regulations had been considerably relaxed and the special courts or committees for the enforcement of them had disappeared. These have now been reconstituted, and the task of enforcing the restrictions has been divided between them and the civil authorities. Stocks of gramophone needles were seized, and it is said that they can now only be bought from the police; but I will not vouch for this libel on the public service of a friendly Power. It is too soon to say whether the recent measures mark a definite change of policy [219 m—4Ji towards Wahhabi extremism and a stronger imposition of Nejd on the Hejaz, or whether they were merely adopted to create a good atmosphere for the King s stay at Riadh. His Majesty made some very pious speeches before he left Mecca on the 28th June, but there is nothing unusual in that. ... 7. I have dealt in separate despatches with the financial situation and the proceedings of the Nationalist Conference. I need not dwell on them fuithei here, except to mention one side effect of the financial and economic difficulties which may have some political importance. The King was casting about in many directions before he left with a view to raising the wind in foreign quarters. The Soviet representative seems to have taken a hand in the game, and is reported to have sold 50,000 cans of benzine to the Government on easy terms. More than this cannot be affirmed, but M. Turakulov's deal has naturally given rise to rumours that the Hejazi Government have come to terms with the Kolsheviks on a more extensive basis. I am asking Mr. Hope-Gill to watch for an}/ develop ments in this direction, though at present I see no evidence of more than a commercial transaction, and doubt whether there is much to come of it. 8.

I HAVE dealt in previous reports, ending with my despatch No. 253 of the 1st July, with the deplorable financial situation of the Hejazi Government and the various exchange crises of the last four or five months. I mentioned in my despatch No. 253 and have had occasion to refer elsewhere to the plan for improving the internal exchange by generalising the use of the Hejazi currency throughout Ibn Sand's dominions, a plan which the National Conference seems to have recommended, with the rider that the Maria Theresa dollar should be eliminated gradually and about which the King himself spoke to me in my audience of the 17th June. 2. This matter was the subject of a Government notice published in the ' Umm-al-Qura' of the 19th June. After a pious exordium, the notice explains in a rather involved manner the reasons for which, while postponing any decision to enforce the exclusive use of the Hejazi currency, the Government have been impelled to lay down certain rules with a view to facilitating transactions and obviating usurious practices. I enclose a translation of the portion of the notice containing those rules, which are to operate as from the end of Safar, i.e., mid- July 1931. 3. The effect of the rules is not altogether clear to me, but it would appear to be that the silver and nickel currency of the Hejaz is made legal tender throughout the King's dominions, under unspecified penalties for refusing it; but that the use of other currencies is allowed subject to certain conditions, including the fixation of internal rates of exchange. I doubt whether the exact effect matters much as the events of the last few months have shown that the Government cannot enforce for long any regulations aiming at an artificial stabilisation of the exchange. At the time of writing this despatch the quotation for riyals in Jedda is about 14 = £1. 4.

I now have the honour to transmit to you herewith a picturesque account by the Indian vice-consul attached to this Legation of the activities of the committee in Mecca, which he visited during the first week in August.C) Although I suspect that the picture is somewhat overdrawn, what I learn from other sources confirms the main fact that the Hejaz is being made to feel the Nejdi yoke more heavily than before, probably as a counterpoise to Ibn Saud's long absence in Nejd. The Hejazis are becoming more and more embittered, and their talk is increasingly of revolution, but they are not the stuff of which revolu tionaries are made. In Munshi Ihsanullah's words, with great restraint they have checked themselves, as they have none at their back. 3.

I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE-GILL. (') Not printed. [246 h—1]End. 2 to S. No. (85). H. M. C harge d'affaires, 1 During my last visit to Mecca I noticed a great change among the people there. Since the abolition of the Religious Committee, they enjoyed personal freedom to a great extsnt. The tyranny of the infernal Nejdi soldiers was gradually becoming a dream in the public life and passing into dark oblivion. The only discontent prevailing among them was the general grievance bound up with the life of a public body. The effect of the world wide depression told heavily upon them and it was further magnified by the imposition of heavier taxes upon the pilgrims and the consequent decrease in their number, which ultimately affected the market and deprived the people of their income, inasmuch as every one in Mecca directly or indirectly has to depend upon the pilgrims for their means of subsistence. The people placed in such financial difficulties could not but resent the exploitation of the Hejaz money in Nejd. This menacing economic problem confronted the people with an ordeal which absorbed all their attention. At this critical stage in the life of the nation, King Ibn Sa'ud instead of sympathis ing with his subjects and devising means for the amelioration of their v condi- tion, wantonly injured their feelingsvby ordering the revival of the defunct Religious Committee. 2. This Committee has re-appeared with greater powers for evil. In the past, the offenders were given a chance to appear before a body of not ables, among whom there were one or two citizens who had the natural in clination to be lenient and sympathetic towards their fellow-citizens in crime; the well-to-do persons were also treated properly and tried in camera. But now the Committee is different from that in the past. It has been given summary powers and it has brought in its train considerably large numbers of Nejdi soldiers employed in its service. There are 20 Nejdi soldiers on behalf of the Religious Committee in each Hara (quarter), thus their total number within the municipal jurisdiction of Mecca is 260, which is even greater than the military force kept at the Jedda Garrison. The cruelty and avarice of the Nejdi soldiers are well-known and need no recapitulation. The presence of such a large number of the inhuman .and unsympathetic element m each Hara of Mecca has naturally created a terror in the heart's of the public. These brutes being let loose are perpetrating all sorts cf cruelties and harassing the people simply to satisfy their brutal nature. There is no law to restrain them. They move like tyrants of folk-lore and as sume the air of an autocrat who is above law and order. Especially on the occasion of the five-times-a-day prayer, these incarnations of the civil wildly run through the public thorough-fares and enter the lanes and bye-lanes in pursuit of the defaulters who might have taken shelter there, and on dis covery fall upon them with all their might and beat them mercilessly. There is no distinction between good or bad, rich or poor, young or old, and even school boys of minor age are not spared. They lay them down on the public road and flog them indiscriminately. Any one having a spark of humanity in him cannot bear the scene of such inhuman perpetrations on the helpless citizens. If any unfortunate has the audacity to advance argu ments or oppose, his days may be numbered or he may be required to go to the hospital to dress his wounds sustained at the hands of these brutes of religion. 3. I happened to see the condition once with my own eyes. Just before prayer, I drove in a car to the remoter quarter of the city and found these hungry dogs more active there than in the adjoining quarters of the Holy Harem, in the pursuit of their infernal perpetrations; and I was able to realise the truth of the general complaints of the people. 4. Tobacco, on which the Wahhabi Government impose heavy customs duty, is the cause of another trouble, from which both the shop-keepers and their customers suffer considerably. Whenever they are detected in carrying on transactions on this 'Forbidden' article, they fall a victim to the Nejdi wrath and indignity. It is difficult to fathom the Wahhabi logic and l632(c) FiPD 0 5:.-7/ account for thsir peculiar principle. It is curious to note that while the puritan Wahhibi Government have not made any legislation to prohibit the entry of tobacco into the Hejaz, rather on the other hand, they do not hesi tate to protit their revenues from the taxes imposed on it, they allow the people engaged in lawful transaction to sufier insult and disgrace. 5. The unrestricted tyranny and persecution all through, combined with the miserable condition ot the people, have naturally moved the hearts of even those who are the best friends and well-wishers of the Government. The citizens are tired, their patience has exceeded the limit, but helpless as they are, they cannot overthrow the Wahhabi yoke. But history seems to have repeated itself and the weak have adopted against the oppressor the same old policy of starting secrat activities. I happened to see a copy of the leaflets which are being distributed secretly amongst the citizens. I managed to get a copy of one, which I attach herewith for your perusal. The worried people have taken to this course in order to satisfy the burning desire of their heart. This is a sort of propaganda, saying to the people that the days of agonies and troubles are numbered and that the nation will heave a sigh of relief to find the new Government established in Rajab (November-December) of this year. These leaflets originated at Mecca, have now reached Jedda and in no time may reach the interior. 6. I had some discourse with a city notable who related to me the pain ful stories of the hardships and miseries to which the Hejazis have been put and under which they are groaning and dragging their miserable exis tence. He said that the discontent of the people has reached its zenith and all the Hejazis, whether citizen or Beduin, are greatly agitated and any small spark may bring about a great conflagration. With great restraint they have checked themselves, as they have none at their back; and that if they get the slightest hope of assistance from any quarter, the regime of Ibn Sa'ud in the Hejaz will end instantaneously. I advised the gentleman not to think of revolutions as it will prove fatal to all. It will not bring about any useful result but will injure their cause. It is a suicidal policy and the whole nation will suffer immensely from its consequence. He concurred with my views, but added that Ibn Sa'ud has given a fresh impetus to the anti-Saudi organisation by reviving the Religious Committee, and this may ultimately result in the opening of negotiations between the discontented Heiazis at home and Ibn Sa'ud's enemies abroad.

IN my despatch No. 177 of the 15th May/l attempted to bring up to date the information in my earlier despatch No. 108 of the 23rd March, regaidmg t le financial situation in this country, with special relerence to the problem o exchange. I have had occasion in other reports to ad\ei't to the gi owing hope lessnes:?of Ibn Sand's financial position, and to the way in which it has come to be a dominant factor in the political situation in the Hejaz. 2. There has been no improvement in the financial outlook since the middle of Mav. It seems more than probable, though it cannot be taken as certain, that any ''old reserve which the Director-General ol Finance may ha\e had up his sleeve has been practically exhausted. This is the view of the manager of the Dutch Bank, who was in close touch with the Government during March and April He told me recently that at the end of that period the Government were in fact good for the £60.000 in gold required to bolster up the exchange. ^ I could not ascertain whether he actually made a new arrangement with them tnen but, if he did, little or nothing came of it, and Mr. Jacob's principals m Holland have settled down to an attitude of abstention from further transactions. Before the departure on leave of M. Adriaanse, the future Netherlands Charge d Affaires, who arrived here some months ago to be initiated into his duties in accoi dance with the Dutch system, he was strongly pressed to use his influence at home to get the Dutch Government to get the Dutch Bank to be more accommodating. 1 here is very little chance, however, of their altering then attitude. 3. I have reported elsewhere on the King s experiment of convoking a National Conference of urban representatives, which sat from the 2nd to the 11th June, to review in an advisory capacity the problems confronting the Hejazi Government. Finance was naturally a prominent feature in the proceedings. As mio'ht have been expected, the members of the conference had no comfoi t to offer and such advice as some of them were bold enough to tender was most unpalatable to Ibn Sand. All that the conference effected was to help to give a certain coherence to grievances which have gradually been growing articulate and which may be summed up as follows : (a) The Hejaz is the \ictim of a dou ne drain on its meagre resources, owing to the amount of money expended abroad on extravagant rec[uirements, of which motor cars are the favouiite example, and the amount which is devoted to expenditure proper to Nejd, notabK subsidies to the tribes there; {h) the country has no budget in any tiue sense, and almost unlimited power in the financial domain is exerted by the Director-General, Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman, whose unpopularity increases by leaps and bounds but whose position with the King seems to be unimpaired. Certain members of the conference had the courage to criticise Abdullah Suleiman and to pioclaim the necessity for a budget. The King s reply is said to ha\e been in effect, le budget, c'est moi.' . „ • / wi ^ -i * n 4. The trouble has become concrete m two forms, viz., {a) the tailure ot all efforts to maintain the riyal exchange, and {h) the necessity for finding new money to carry Ibn Sand over a very lean period. Unless assistance can be obtained, it may be confidently anticipated that this period will be one of complete indigence for some months' that the next pilgrimage season will bring some temporary relief, and that, if the pilgrimage is again small, the position a year hence will be at least as bad as it is now. , p , • • j • 5. The silver currency has entered on a new phase of depreciation during the last few weeks. The riyal stands now at about 14| to the pound. The wonder is that it has not gone lower. The King has his own cure, which I described when reporting on my audience of the 17th June. I may repeat myself in order to make this despatch self -contained. All that is necessary, says Ibn Saud, is to bring the Hejazi silver and nickel currency into use throughout his dominions, [' 192 dd—1]and he has taken measures with that object. He may succeed, but i doubt whether he realises how difficult it may be to secure acceptance in countries like Nejd and Asir. of a currency which has been so blown upon in its country of origin. He has, however, discovered one practical device. He left Mecca for Nejd on the 28th June, intending to make a long stay. 1 understand that this time he is going to meet the tribal demands on his generosity by presents in riyals. 6. But the need for new money has now become the major problem. 1 have n\ reported elsewhere Fuad Bey Hamza's broad hint to me on the 12th June, that His Majesty's Government might come to Ibn Saud's help financially as well as \ in other ways. The King himself was more guarded on the 17th June, but he broached a definite request, which I submitted for your consideration in my telegram No. 170 of the 19th June, namely, that His Majesty's Government might help him to enlist the services of a British bank. I mentioned in my telegram the King's statement that he had other offers. I have not been able to find out much on the subject and nothing with certainty. I understand that the Amir Lutfullah, that Syrian in Egypt who has had a financial past in this country, has made approaches. The Banque Misr is also said to be interested. I have heard also of Lloyds and an unnamed fourth, possibly the Eastern Bank, but I doubt very much whether either of them has come forward, although it is possible that Mr. Philby may have been taking soundings. In the enclosure to my despatch No. 235 of the 20th June, I dealt with another project to bring an Indian Moslem bank here. 7. I owe a good deal of the above information, such as it is, to the manager of the Dutch Bank here. According to Mr. Jacobs, what the Government are aiming at is to get a foreign bank to produce something like £200.000, in return for certain privileges like a monopoly of banking operations and privileges of note issue. He thought there might be something in the story about Amir Lutfullah, as that gentleman runs a one-man show, and has on his hands a quantity of very fine notes, all ready printed, which he had made in connexion with his financial ventures here in the last days of the Hashimite regime. Ibn Sand, however, would prefer to interest more regular bankers (and would also, I think, hate to have to borrow in Egypt); but Mr. Jacobs did not see what the Hejazi Government could offer that would be sufficient to attract a serious concern with responsibilities to its shareholders. He emphasised the difficulty of enforcing a monopoly of banking in a place where every merchant of importance does a bit of banking as a side-line. 8. I am more than ever conscious of being (like Ibn Saud) out of my deoth in this subject. Nevertheless, the situation is so serious and has so great a bearing on the political situation in Hejaz-Nejd, that I have thought it well to devote a further separate despatch to it before going on leave. I am sending a copy to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERN MENT EASTERN (A rabia ). July 8, 1931 CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. h [E 3542/2237/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received July 8.) ^ . Jedda, June 20, 1931. IN my despatch No. 200 of the 'i^th May J attempted to give a general appreciation of the situation in the Hejaz. In various other reports I have dealt with particular problems and Ibn Saud s groping ettorts to deal with them before departing for Nejd, as he intends to do in the near future. I he press ot business thus entailed kept him in Mecca long past the date which he had originalh for coming to Jedda. In the event he arrived here on the 14th lune and lelt in the evening of the 17th June. 2. The King's difficulties remain unsolved. I have not yet heard what passed at the National Convention which sat from the 2nd to 11th June. I gather, however, that it produced little except some forward suggestions b\ the bolder members and some consequent Royal displeasure. 3. In these circumstances, the King has been anxiously sizing up his position vis-a-vis of Great Britain, viewed both as a possible source of danger, &gt; having regard to His Majesty s Government's recent severity, but also as a possible helper. Fuad Bey Hamza preceded the King and arrived in Jedda on the 11th June. We discussed current business on the 12th June. On the 13th June he came to see me with the object of expounding general views on the relations between Great Britain and Hejaz—Nejd and with the more special object \ of discussing my personal position in regard to them. This has, unfortunately, become a factor in the general situation, as for some time past the King has taken it into his head that I am hostile, and has attributed the policy of His Majesty's Government to my inspiration. Both he and Fuad Bey exaggerate pathetically my influence. His Majesty has become alarmed, but is great enough to give play to a Royal resentment. I owe it to Fuad Bey to say that he has shown sincere anxiety to bridge the gulf, not only, I think, in order to enlist my assistance, though he naturally desires to do that, but from a genuine belief that I am not such a bad fellow if I am taken the right way. 3. I regret to have to lay stress on this matter of my personal position. 1 do so because it has assumed an absurd importance in Hejazi eyes, and has therefore a more general importance, however factitious. I may say that, ^ although I have been outspoken on various occasions, those on which my language has caused most displeasure have been occasions when I have been carrying out your express instructions. 4. I have the honour to enclose three memoranda describing my various interviews with Fuad Bey and the King during the last week. \ou will see that I have been at special pains to disabuse the King of any idea that I am personally antagonistic. It was with that object that in the various conversations I used on my own side a freedom of language which may appear to you excessive. That was the only way in which I could appear sympathetic, yet remain non-committal. I made it clear throughout that any views I expressed were purely personal. I came away from my audience on the 17th June with the feeling that, with Fuad Bey's help, I had reinstated myself in the King's regard to a considerable extent, but that my tenure of it was precarious and would depend on whether I could see him through with His Majesty's Government. 5. I turn with relief to the substance of the matter. The King wants an understanding with Great Britain. He cannot realise that fhe onlv possible basis 1 ^ of such an understanding is the settlement of questions as they arise. Exaggerating his power, even in the midst of his present weakness, he conceives the possibility of a sort of permanent entente, almost an alliance, and an alliance potentially directed against the Hashimites. He knows that that would be a good thing for him. He imagines that it would be so well worth His Majesty's Government's while that they ought to be ready to help him—and the help he most needs at the present time is pecuniary help in some shape or form. [192 h—1] r6. It would be too cynical to suggest that Ibn Saud is offering to Ills Majesty's Government a ' pure and virgin ' love for a consideration. He is not himself cynical or brazen enough for that. He is more like the maiden of pantomime in a snowstorm, but proudly conscious oi a station, a beaut} and a virtue that, given their chance, must cause her to be loved and honourably set up in life for her own sake. There are Christmas parties behind the windows that glimmer through the snow, and she would like to be taken into the nicest oi those houses—yours, Sir. The maiden feels, if I may pursue a fancy not entirely idle, that you should not count on those Hashimite girls whom you are already enter taining, pretentious hussies who are with you for what they can get and will want more. 'How much happier you would be with me,'' says the maiden, unconsciously vain in her conscious virtue. ' And oh, how happy should 1 be too! ' 7. I have tried to illustrate by a flippant example what I conceive to be Ibn Sand's attitude, because I think it reveals it better than pages of solemn analysis. He is not insincere, but he is fairly desperate at the moment and quite unpractical. He admitted towards the end of our conversation on the 17th June that the questions he had asked me to put to His Majesty's Government were too hypothetical to be answerable. That does not mean that he will not expect some sort of an answer. T do not see what His Majesty's Government can do to help him. Political commitments to him, except those of a purely negative kind, seem to be out of the question. It was decided two years ago that there could be no question of a renewal of direct financial assistance. He hinted then at a request for bread, and he was offered a common form of commercial treaty. I can only leave you to consider whether there is any form of kindness which His Majesty's Government could show him without prejudice to their obligations elsewhere and without spending money. I am telegraphing about one point only, that of the possibility of getting a British bank to help him, because that is a concrete proposal, though it seems to me as unpractical as all the rest. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. (A) Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on June 13. FUAD BEY HAMZA spoke to me at length on the 13th June regarding the general state of relations between Ibn Saud and His Majesty's Government, with somewhat special reference to the effect thereon of my personal position vis-a-vis of His Majesty. He had meditated his statement for some time and it was carefully considered. 2. ' Fuad Bey spoke of the object of my mission. The King's wish to see a British Legation established here was dictated by a desire to have at his Court a representative of such standing that he could represent His Majesty's point of view to His Majesty's Government and speak on their behalf with authority, enjoying a greater latitude in the discussion of affairs than could be expected in the case of a junior official. Fuad Bey stressed the importance of personal factors, and expressed a desire to restore my relations with the King to their former friendly footing. 3. Fuad Bey traced the history of Ibn Sand's relations with His Majesty's Government. They had originated as far back as thirty years ago, when the King was the guest of Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. The policy of His Majesty's Government was favourable to Mubarak at a time when the Turks were backing Ibn Rashid. At that time and afterwards they had lent their moral support to Ibn Saud. Their relations with him were strengthened during the Great War. A treaty had been concluded at that time, establishing relations of such a nature that His Majesty had accepted a kind of vassalage of Great Britain, to which it was unnecessary now to look back, as that situation had been ended by the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. 4. The friendly relations, Fuad Bey said, had passed through periods when His Majesty's Government seemed cooler or even antagonistic. They had supported King Hussein in the dispute over Taraba and Khurma in 1918-19. Ibn Rashid had been given support from the Iraq side before his death in 1921,and afterwards the Shammar had been used against Ibn Saud. Vvhen Ibn Saud secured Taraba and Khurma, His Majesty's Government had accepted the new situation, but they pursued a policy which had the appearance of encircling the King. The installation of King Feisul and the Amir Abdullah in Iraq and Transjordan at a time when Ibn Saud was pushing northward, and the use made o'f frontier tribes, had strengthened the impression, though it may have been erroneous, that such an encirclement was in progress. 5. The pressure of encirclement was relieved when in 19124 the British lost faith in Hussein and the King embarked on the campaign which drove the Hashimites out of the Hejaz. But there was still a pressure from the north. Fuad Bey referred to statements by Sir P. Cox and/or Sir H. Dobbs which implied that Great Britain could look across the frontiers at Ibn Saud and see him reduced to impotence. (When correcting this passage Fuad Bey was rather uncertain. He recollected something which Sir H. Dobbs had said to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Bagdad and thought that something had appeared in the press. He offered to look the matter up, but 1 did not ask him to do so.) 6. Fuad Bey referred to recent controversies, which had arisen during my mission here, as marking a fresh phase of apparent coldness and antagonism on the part of His Majesty's Government. Now for thirty years, ne continued, the King had served British interests. He indicated in general terms six ways in which Ibn Saud had done this :— (1) He had always placed his reliance on the British. (2) He had always kept himself and his country quiet and had not molested Great Britain's allies. He had eventually made war on his own people for the sake of Great Britain and Iraq. (3) He had helped Great Britain during and after the war. He had attacked Ibn Rashid. When he knew that Hussein was backed by His Majesty's Government, and that it was a British interest that Hussein should not be interfered with, he had accepted the position and maintained friendly relations with Hussein as far as possible. (4) In his attitude towards critical situations in British dependencies, e.g., in Palestine and India, he had used a moderating influence. (5) and (6) It had been, and was still, his policy never to go against British advice and to discountenance Soviet propaganda, working in close co-operation with Great Britain in regard to the latter. 7. Fuad Bey did not pretend that the King had studied British interests alone in working on the above lines. lie had followed them because it v.&lt;is &lt;i!&gt; in his own interest to do so. n ^ i 8. Fuad Bey went on to say that the friendship between Ibn baud and Great Britain rested on a sound basis, unlike the friendship with King reisul and the Amir Abdullah, which was not, and could not on the side of those rulers, be genuine. Great Britain had in Iraq and Iransjordan a pi i\ilcged position which it was important for her to maintain, but which could not be maintainea without prejudice to the national aspirations of these countries. There was a conflict between British interests and those national aspirations such that true friendship was impossible. There was nothing of the sort to mar the relations between Great Britain and Ibn hand. Except in one mattei, which Fuad Be\ hoped to see disposed of in the near future, namely, slavery, we did not seek to impose ourselves on Ibn Saud. Was there anything else ? he asked me. (1 replied that our policy in regard to slavery was important to us, and that 1 liad told mm my views. I recognised that there was nothing fundamental to divide Ibn Saud and His Majesty's Government, though I should have more to say about the details of Fuad Bey's statement.) 9. Fuad Bey described the friendship between the King and Great Britain, in contrast with those other friendships of which he had spoken, as being 'pure and virgin. ' It could be utilised. , , 10. What did Great Britain want of Ibn baud? Hiad Bey asked. He supplied an answer under six general heads as follows :— (1) The continued maintenance ot friendly and peacetul relations. (2) The continued maintenance of the security in this country which was essential, p . cj ., in the interests of Britisli pilgrims. (3) The maintenance of friendly relations with the surrounding countries in which Great Britain had special interests. [192 h—1] B :(4) The King's dominions so situated as to lie across the line ot British imperial communications through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and by the transdesert route to the north of them; it was Great Britain's interest that there should he no menace to those communications. (5) In particular, Great Britain wished to he free to use the Hasa coast for purposes of aerial communication, a thing which could only be done on a basis of friendship with Ibn Sand, and which was all the more important because of the possible difficulty of using Persian territory. (6) It was in Great Britain's interest to counteract Bolshevik propaganda in the East, whether illegitimate or carried on under a cloak of legality, and in this His Majesty co-operation was needed. 11. Fuad Bey said that these were very general headings, under each of which special questions arose. He instanced the question of Aqaba and Ma an and questions in the Persian Gulf. He regarded such matters as being ot subsidiary importance. 12. ' The King was on his side, Fuad Bey went on, compelled to rely on the assistance and support of Great Britain. 13. The object of my mission, he said, should be to harmonise and promote the interests of both sides, between which interests there was no contradiction. 14. I observed that Fuad Bey had indicated what, in his view, were the things for which Great Britain looked to Ibn Saud, but he had indicated in a sinoTe sentence only the things for which His Majesty looked to Great Britain. 0 15. Fuad Bey said that he was prepared for questions on his statement. He could not tell me the King's desiderata in detail without taking instructions, but he could tell me his own ideas on the understanding that 1 sliould treat vv nat he said as purely personal. He developed then, on this agreed understanding, on the following lines :— (1) A settlement of the Hejaz Railway question, which interested the King both politically and economically; politically from the point ot view of bringing certain parts of his dominions into closer touch with each other; economically, because of the value of the railway, it reconditioned, as a means ot rapid transit. Fuad Be^ reteired to a private letter which I had written to the King and which was m the file. I said that, while I was not authorised to discuss the question, I was glad to know that His Majesty's advisers had know ledge of the letter, which had taken the form it did for very special reasons. Fuad Bey understood those reasons, and said that, as they had imposed a special course of action, a suitable communication would be made to me in reply in the first instance. (2) The question of Aqaba and Ma'an was still unsettled. He did not say that the King wished to reopen it now or to press it. but it was an outstanding matter between him and His Majesty's Government. (3) The King desired assistance in connexion with the extensive Wakfs in territory under British control. (4) Fuad Bey said that he was on such terms with me that he could speak of a matter, which others might hesitate to broach so frankly. viz ; . the financial needs of this countrv. I knew very well, he said, the King's difficulties and liabilities. He was expected to maintain security, to provide a sound sanitary administration; to improve his ports; to promote economic development ; and to seek resources other than the pilgrimage on which the country at present depended and which had become precarious. He reminded me that the Turks in their time had to maintain an army of 30,000 men in the Hejaz, and to subsidise tribes as well. The resources available were known. I observed that I myself had no accurate idea of them.) If the King had to work on 'the Turkish plan and did things on the Turkish scale, it would now be necessary to spend £1 million to £2 million a year on security alone. It was also necessary to provide for the civil administration and for representatives abroad. Fuad Bey, after enumerating those burdens, observed that both King Hussein and Ibn Saud had enjoyed British financial assistance in the past.(5) Finally, Fuad Bey said, His Majesty's Government could help Ibn .Saud by ensuring a good attitude on the part ot his neighbours, m regai to whom we had a special position. 16. Fuad Bey assured me, and renewed the assurance later, that the King desired a perfect understanding with His Majesty's (Government, and that, it such an understanding existed. His Majesty was prepared to meet us on all the points to which he conceived us to attach importance. 17. I thanked Fuad Bey for speaking to me so fully and frankly. 1 here followed a long and intimate conversation which was confined to the question of my personal relations with Ibn Sand, to which luad Bey had referred tac - fully as being in need of restoration to an earlier and better tooting, i saK that I myself had been conscious of a strain. T traced in detail the history o relations with Ibn Saud, referring to the various occasions on which, m dealing with particular matters, notably the Transjordan frontier question, 1 appearef to have given offence. While agreeing generally with Fuad Beys detmition ot the object of a mission like mine, and his view as to the importance ot persona factors in diplomacy, I pointed out that, in questions of the hignest impoitaiue, diplomatic representatives were increasingly dependent on their central (lOvern- ments and that the importance of personal factors, great as it was, was apt to be exaggerated in Eastern countries. I said, not by way of excuse or apology, but out of mv strong desire to disabuse the King of any idea that 1 was antagonistic, that, if at times I had spoken or written very plainly, it was either because I was bound by quite definite instructions or else because 1 wished to o-et certain questions settled without their assuming such importance as to ct His Majesty's Government into the necessity of themselves taking a strong line. When instructions assumed final form they had to be carried out. Fhe hnal form often differed from the original form as a result of consultation with me. I deprecated any idea that the attitude taken up by His Majesty's Government over, e.q., Transjordan frontier question was inspired by me or was due to anything except the serious view that His Majesty's Government found them selves compelled to take up a particular situation, which had been exaggerated to a dangerous point since October. n . « at -* 18. I pointed out to Fuad Bey the special difficulties of a Minister m dealing with a King who was effectively his own Minister for Toreign Affairs and delegated so little authority to his advisers that he handled foreign business himself not only by directing general policy but by going into all the details personally. It was a necessary consequence of this that a Minister might have to address direct to the King communications, sometimes of a disagreeable nature, which, in other countries, would normally be addressed to a Minister of State. 19. Fuad Bey recognised my difficulties and promised to do everything in his power to satisfy the King that my attitude was not one of hostility. He suggested that, when I had strong representations to make, T should make them to himself rather than direct. I said that it was necessary for me to lay certain matters before His Majestv in person, and that I was sometimes formally directed to do so. Subject to this I was quite prepared, and myself preferred, to discuss details with the King's advisers. T . . . 20. As it was late, we agreed to reserve anything T might have to say m regard to the remainder of Fuad Bey's statement for a further interview. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. (B) Further Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on June 16. FUAD BEY came to see me again on the 16th June. We discussed some minor matters, but his main purpose was to complete our conversation of the 13th June before I should see the King. The following is a much-condensed account of what passed :— 2. Fuad Bey brought me the King's reply to my recent private communica tion about the Hejaz Railway. (1 am dealing with this separately.) He brought also a less formal letter of his own, in which he suggested certain corrections in my record of his statement of the 13th June, which I had let him see. (I have [192 h—1] B Sintroduced these corrections into the record of our first conversation.) He asked me to add the following points to his original statement:— (a) He had spoken to me without instructions from the King, but he was personally convinced that the King's interest lay in a good under standing with Great Britain. (b) He knew that the King himself had the best intentions towards Great Britain and relied on her alone. 3. Fuad Bey explained that, in these circumstances, his object was to arrive at an understanding with me as to the objects we should jointly pursue, using our influence with our respective authorities. I replied that I was at one with him in his idea that we should work together to promote good relations, but said that our positions were different. He was the King's adviser on foreign affairs and was the real Minister for Foreign Affairs, in so far as there was any such Minister other than the King himself, for the Emir Feisul, the theoretical Minister, did not, so far as I knew, concern himself with foreign business. He (Fuad) was therefore in the position of a responsible statesman. I myself was a civil servant. I could, and did, advise my Government on particular questions, but normally a diplomatic representative did not shape major policy. I could hardly, therefore, enter into a contract, as it were, to pursue a given set of objects, though I could, and would, collaborate with him. 4. I had promised to give Fuad Bey some observations on his statement of the 14th June. I began with his historical retrospect recognising that all through Ibn Sand had been a friend. Fuad Bey knew more, 1 said, than I did about the details of the recent history of Arabia. I suggested, however, that he had not paid sufficient attention to the fact that the events to which he had adverted were all parts of a difficult process of readjustment following on the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. The position after the Great War was that there were certain parts of Arabia in which we had taken on definite responsibilities and others in which we had a less direct interest, two being areas ruled over by two Sovereigns who were both our friends. We were indebted to King Hussein as well as to Ibn Sand. We had sought to work for a, stable Arabia and to compose differences. Ibn Sand had, so far as territory was concerned, come best out of the whole process, not thanks to us but to himself. Fuad had spoken of encirclement. It appeared to me that we had been on the edge of the circle first and that Ibn Sand had expanded until he filled it. For me, I said, history began with the Treaty of Jedda in 1927. subject to there being a pre-history dating from 1925, Owing to our special responsibilities in Iraq and Transjordan we had negotiated the Bahra and Hadda Agreements at a time when Ibn $aud had not yet completed his conquest of the Hejaz. 5. Fuad Bey suggested that all would have been well had we kept the adjoining countries under our own control and had not introduced into them as rulers the King's enemies. I said that the first alternative was out of the question, because responsible people in Great Britain and British public opinion did not want enlarged commitments but reduced commitments in the East, and because there were nationalist sentiments to be reckoned with in the countries themselves. Those sentiments had been strong in Iraq and they existed in fransjordan, though the position of that territory was different and its evolution was less complete. I demurred strongly to the idea that there could be no real friendship between us and those countries, because we retained a special position, which in the case of Iraq would be reduced to an absolute minimum when the treaty of 1930 became operative. We wished to be, and thought we could be, friends with everybody. Our ideal was to see settled States in Arabia in fi iendship with us and with each other. A great measure of equilibrium had been achieved. There were States with definite frontiers, even though the Transjordan frontier, for instance, was in one part still a theatre of difficulty and in anothei the subject of an outstanding question, as he had reminded me when speaking of Aqaba and Maan. I had never had occasion to deal with that paiticular question and did not mean to discuss it. It had been in abeyance since 192/, when we had stated a position which the King had not accepted; but he had agreed to a status quo and modus vivendi, and all I could see for it if there were an outstanding question, was that the status quo and the modus vivendi should continue, (l uad Bey reminded me that he had himself disclaimed any7 idea of reopening or pressing the question at the present time.) 1 he equilibrium, I said, was such that the King had come into contact with us in every direction save one. Our desire for stability was such that we wished to see peace on all his frontiers, even on the one on which he had no contact with us. e were not concerned with the Yemen and I had never spoken about it, but on that side, too, we should like to see good relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam, with whom we got on quite well, though we had not succeeded in making a treaty with him. 6. Turning to Fuad Bey's statement of what he conceived to be our desiderata, I said that it seemed to me to cover the ground pretty well. We certainly wanted the first four things he had enumerated. 1 recognised that the King's great achievement was that he had established security, a matter of direct interest to us in the pilgrim area when it was complete and of indirect interest to us in a more general sense As regards the fifth point on his list, T did not know the position as regards flying over Persia, but we should like to have freedom in agreement with the Powers concerned to fly either way along the Persian Gulf. In so far as Bolshevik propaganda was still an active force in the East, it was our interest to counteract it. (Fuad Bey said he wished to speak to me another time about Bolshevik propaganda.) 7. As regards Fuad Bey's purely personal estimate of the ways in which His Majesty's Government might help the King. I said as little as I could. I said that, if he wished in due course to speak about the Hejaz Railway, I would report what he had to say; I had no instructions on the subject. I had said all I would say about Aqaba and Maan—another question which had not arisen since I came here. He had referred to Persian Gulf questions. There had been a talk of ^ discussing them last year, but eventually the Biscoe incident had held everything up. My Government were anxious that these questions should be handled by Colonel Biscoe, as they were in his sphere. T could not, therefore, speak of the desiderata on both sides, but I might mention the impression produced by the King's prolonged blockade, as it were, of Koweit. As for Wakfs, the King had discussed the subject with Sir G. Clayton in 1927 and had formulated desiderata. They had been carefully considered, and later in the year a reply had been returned, based on the constant policy of His Majesty's Government of not interfering in so purely religious a matter. I remarked that I myself, though I sometimes made representations about Wakfs in the Hejaz at the instance of British Moslem interested parties, a thing rather different from interfering in Wakfs in a country which we administered or controlled in any way, always did so with hesitation and within as narrow limits as possible. There were, I observed in passing, many Wakfs for the benefit of pilgrims at Mecca, and the Hejazi Government would do well to see that they were well cared for. 8. I turned to finance. It was true that in the past His Majesty's Govern ment had assisted King Hussein and Ibn Saud. That w^as part of a policy arising ^ out of the war, when money was spent on many things—we had, for instance, spent millions on buying fish in Norway merely to prevent its going to our enemies. Economy was now the order of the day. It was a plank in every political platform in England. It was practised by His Majesty's Government. Every Government must now stand on its own feet. That was a hard saying, but true. I knew of the difficulties of this country. I realised that it was too dependent on the pilgrimage. I saw salvation only in the development of the fresh economic resources to which the Government had been turning their attention. I had heard ^ of press statements about an application to Sweden for a geological mission. T had nothing against that. I would not encourage any hope of direct financial assistance from Great Britain, if that was what was in Fuad Bey's mind. British interest might possibly be enlisted in connexion with economic schemes. If I could help with any advice in regard to such schemes I would be happy to do so. 9. Time was running out and I could not follow up the one remaining point in Fuad Bey's statement of the 13th June; fortunately, perhaps, as Fuad Bey yC might have harped on an idea, which emerged in the course of our conversations, that Ibn Sand's assistance, negative or even positive, would be useful to His Majesty's Government if ever they had trouble in Iraq or Transjordan. I wound up the conversation by saying that I had given him an exposition of my own ideas. If they were in some ways discouraging, he would not take it amiss. It would be easy enough, but not honest, to intimate agreement with him; to say when hesuggested our working together on some particular line : Ves, that s splendid; I'll put it up to my Government, and say two or three months later that my Government had turned it down. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. (C) Record of Audiences with Ibn Sand on June 14 and. 17, 1931. THE King arrived in Jedda early on the 14th June. In accordance with his custom he received the foreign representatives in succession that morning. As my audience on this occasion was formal I did not touch on current business, but I said that I had been awaiting an opportunity of conveying to His Majesty the congratulations of His Majesty's Government on the successful negotiations with Iraq (see Foreign Oaice telegram No. 86 of the 21st May). I said that I had previously offered my own congratulations and those of Sir F. Humphrys, but that His Majesty's Government had waited until ratification was assured. I explained that I had received my instructions some little time ago when His Majesty was expected in Jedda, but that, having told Sheikh \ussuf Yasin the nature of the message, I had deferred the communication until I could see the King in person. The King paid a renewed tribute to the part played by His Majesty's Government and myself, and spoke with great appreciation of Sir F. Humphrys, when at a later stage I said that Sir Francis had asked me to thank him for his gracious reply to a personal letter sent at the time of Nuri Pasha's visit. I observed that we had, indeed, worked hard for a successful result, but that its attainment was due to the attitude observed by the parties directly concerned in the final negotiations. 2. I had discussed outstanding business so thoroughly with Fuad Bey that I had really little to say to the King himself during this visit to Jedda. I therefore told Fuad Bey on the 15th June that I was not applying for a business audience, but that it might be useful if I saw the King, as His Majesty was going to Riadh and I to London; that he himself might have matters to discuss with me; and that, in any case, I hoped the King would give me a few minutes before he left for Mecca, so that I might pay my respects on the eve of our separation for a long period. 3. The King received me on the 17th June and kept me for two hours. Fuad Bey interpreted, and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin was present nearly the whole time. I began by saying very much what I had said to Fuad Bey, as stated in the previous paragraph. It was clear that His Majesty did not wish any more than I did myself to discuss the details of any particular question, but he engaged me in a conversation of a general kind, in which on his position vis-a-vis of His Majesty's Government. The following is an account of what passed, necessarily abridged and not based on notes. I have omitted one or two digressions : — 4. The King spoke of his old friendship with Great Britain. He said that in reverting to this theme, he did not mean to imply that the friendship was in peril, but it was well to remind himself and His Majesty's Government of it. The capital question for him was that of his personal position as sovereign of the dominions over which he now ruled. He had, he said, had three inter mediaries with His Majesty's Government—Sir Percy Cox. Sir Gilbert Clayton and myself. He said that he had been led to expect much by Sir P. Cox, but that Sir Percy had not fulfilled his promises or justified his (the King's) expectations; Later he had disclosed his mind to Sir Gilbert Clayton and had charged him to report all that was in it to His Majesty's Government. He did not know what Sir Gilbert had reported, but there had been no response, as Sir Gilbert had gone to Iraq and had died soon after. He was now going to go over the same ground with me, not having been able to do so last year when our discussions related to particular matters. He mentioned that he had given Sheikh Hafiz Wahba a very general idea of what he was aiming at, but that the sheikh had reported that he had not found a suitable opportunity of speaking to His Majesty's Government. 5. I said that I was at the entire disposal of the King to convey anything he might wish to communicate to His Majesty's Government.6. The King said that there was nothing in the general sitnation in Arabia to cause anxiety. The situation might, however, change. He was the friend of Great Britain, whatever might befall. It any change occurred, ii, for instance, His Majesty's Government had dilficulties in neighbouring countries (I do not recollect very clearly the words used, but this was implied if not stated), he \vould like to know where he stood. What acts would His Majesty's Government wish him to avoid ? In what positive way could he assist them in case of need ? I liese were the questions which he had sought to elucidate in the past through Sir P. ^ ox and Sir G. Clayton. He was asking me now to obtain answers to them. How did he stand ? He did not mean that his friendship depended on the answer. He would be Great Britain's friend as he had always been, if they needed his friendship. He was not making it a matter of bargaining. 7. I undertook to convey His Majesty's statement to His Majesty's Govern ment. I added that I could hardly venture to say much myself, but that 1 should like to offer a few observations. On this the King said that he was not only giving me a message, but seeking my personal advice. He did not wish to say anything that might produce a bad effect or breed suspicion. 8. Thus encouraged. I said rather more than 1 at first intended. 1 reminded the King that he had sent Sheikh Yussuf Yasin to speak to me on t 1 e 1st April about his perturbation over the apparent tension between Great Britain and himself. 1 had told the sheikh that His Majesty's Government's fundamental attitude of friendship towards the King had not chano-ed. and had stressed the fact that His Majesty's Government dealt with particular questions on their merits. I had not disguised the danger of general relations being affected by such a question as that of the Transjordan frontier, but the danger had now been averted. The language I had used to Sheikh Yussuf and similar language on other occasions had been approved. 9. I spoke of the bases of our friendship with Ibn Sand. Old association was a factor in it;.that always counted for something. The impression which he created personally was another factor; those of my countrymen who had had intercourse with him had always, in my experience, been attracted by his personality. The greatest factor of all was, however, the fact that His Majesty's Government saw in him an element of stability in a country where they desired stability. We were a nation of shopkeepers and wanted stability everywhere. We had a more special interest in stability in Arabia for reasons into which I would not enter, as I did not wish to be too lengthy. 10. The King, I said, had sought my advice about his message to His Majesty's Government. I did not dissuade him from sending it; I could not encourage him to hope for a definite reply. I knew little of what Sir P. Cox had done in Arabia, but I had known him otherwise. Whatever turn he might give to a matter, neither he nor Sir G. Clayton were men who would fail to report fully anything the King had said. If he had elicited no answer, I thought it was because his questions related to a hypothetical case. It was a fixed principle with His Majesty's Government to deal with questions as they arose, and they had a horror of defining an attitude in regard to hypothetical cases. I enlarged on this. 11. On this the King admitted that he could not expect a definite answer to his questions. What he wanted was to expound his views to His Majesty s Government and (this was implied rather than stated) to enlist my assistance. 12. I took the opportunity of begging the King to believe that I was sincerely well-disposed towards him and his country. I would, and did, represent his views to my Government. As I had told Fuad Bey, final instructions might differ from original instructions as a result of my suggestions, but final instructions must be carried out. The representative of a Government was like a chisel in the hands of a carpenter, an essential tool, but worked by the carpenter. 13. The King appreciated this. He suggested, however, that before' carrying out instructions I should ascertain his Government s side of the case, in order that it might be taken into account. I did not analyse this obviously impossible suggestion. I assured the King of my good dispositions, and said that I had used the analogy of the chisel advisedly. It was a necessary tool and it must be sharp, so that it could be used in the carpenter's hand to produce things of beauty; it might also make rude cuts. I said I was sure that if we could get the Transjordan problem out of the way, there was nothing to trouble relations. I reminded the King of his promise to receive the Political Resident in thePersian Gulf, and said I hoped the visit could be arranged if the King was staying some months in I\ejd. I added that 1 could not suggest anything definite at the moment, as Colonel Biscoe had been ill, and had, 1 believed, left for Kngland. 14. I was about to leave, but the King detained me. He said he did not want to do anything behind my back. He had not consulted his advisers about what he was going to say, but he had made up his mind to say it, whatever they might think. It was a question of the financial position. This had two aspects. The first was the exchange situation, which turned on two factors—riyals and nickel. Steps had been taken to gather in nickel, and it had been rehabilitated. As for riyals, His Majesty intended to bring them into legal circulation throughout all his dominions, and this would produce relief, as the quantity of silver money was not excessive and an extended use would suffice to revalorise it. The other question was that of banking arrangements. There had been an arrangement with the Dutch Bank, which had broken down on questions between its repre sentatives here and their principals. The King said he would like to find another bank, which under suitable arrangements would serve the purposes of a State bank. He would prefer a British institution. He sought my advice and that of His Majesty's Government. 15. I said that my personal opinion would have no value, as 1 knew too little of the machinery of banking. I would willingly consult His Majesty's Govern ment. T hinted that I thought it would be difficult to find a British bank, but did not exclude the possibility of interesting firms like Barclays, who were in the Red Sea, or Lloyds, who were in Egypt. 16. The King said what he wanted to know was whether he might or might not hope for a British bank, and whether any firm who was interested would send a representative. The matter was of some urgency, as he had received offers from other quarters. 1 said 1 had heard various reports. T had heard, for instance, of a plan to authorise an Indian Moslem bank to establish itself here, although it had been represented to me as an idea conceived with a view to the convenience of pilgrims rather than with the more general purpose the King had indicated. This was a feeler, in case His Majesty should feel inclined to say something about the other advances made to him. He did not, however, respond. aflthis document is the property of his britannic majesty's government EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL [E 4177/2064/25] August 12, 1931 Section 3. No. 1. \ Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—[Received August 12.) (No. 291.) Sir, Jedda, July 16, 1931. I HAVE the honour to state that I received your telegram No. 113 of the 14th July, relative to the possibility of a British bank establishing itself in the Hejaz, just before an interview with Fuad Bey Hamza, who came down from Mecca for the inside of the day on the 15th July. I seized the opportunity of reading the first paragraph of your telegram to Fuad Bey, who manifested no surprise or disappointment, 2. In view of the first sentence of the second paragraph of your telegram, I told Fuad Bey as from myself that, while I did not exclude the possibility of the Hejazi Government enlisting the interest of a British bank, I could not honestly encourage them to hope for much in that direction. I let fall the various names I had heard mentioned in connexion with possible arrangements with bankers (see paragraphs 6 and 7 of my despatch No. 253 of the 1st July); but Fuad Bey was not to be drawn. 3. I thought it inadvisable to suggest consultation with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., (Limited), as regards the choice of a person to act for the Hejazi Government in the city. That firm have extensive and peculiar relations with the Hejazi Government and are themselves engaged in banking here on a fairly important scale. Their position vis-a-vis of the Government is so variable that any reference I might make to them in this connexion would almost certainly be misunderstood either as an encouragement to hope that the firm might themselves come to the help of the Government, which they are not prepared to do except on the most moderate scale, or as an attempt on my part to ram them down the throats of the Government. 4. As an illustration of the singular way in which all such matters are approached here, I may mention that on the 8th July, Fuad Bey asked me, at the instance of the Director-General of Finance, to use my influence with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. in favour of an arrangement whereby they would provide money for the specific purpose of maintaining the Hejazi representative missions abroad. The Director-General was prepared to give security— apparently by depositing local silver currency—and to promise that the business would be perfectly safe. I asked why Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman did not go to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. himself^ adding that I understood they were on the best of terms. Fuad Bey said that he thought they were no longer on such good terms as formerly. Anyhow, he had been asked to pass on the message and was doing so; but he was careful to add in fairly clear language that he would prefer not to back his colleague's word. 5. I was naturally not very eager to intervene, least of all with a view to urging Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. to involve themselves in unsound business. I promised, however, to speak to the manager, Mr. A. J. Warner, When I did so three days later, I found that he had an appointment with Abdullah Suleiman himself for that afternoon and was expecting the Director- General to talk biggish business, e.g., to see what Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co, would do in return for a monopoly of the importation of benzine and petroleum. The upshot of the whole thing, as I learnt later from Mr. Warner, was that Abdullah Suleiman asked for £1,500 to cover one month's expenditure on the missions abroad and promised to pay interest on the sums already due by the Government to the firm, a matter of £6,000 to £7,000. Mr. Warner is quite happy about these outstandings and thought his firm would run to the extra £1,500. I was able to telephone to Fuad Bey that I understood the Director- General had had a satisfactory interview with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co.'s manager, and I left it at that, I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN, [219 m—3] 'THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3931/2064/25] August 7, 1931 Section 1. No. 1. Mr. A. Henderson to Mr. Hope-Gill [Jedda). (No. 308.) Sir, Foreign Office, August 7, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram to Sir A. Ryan, No. 113 of the 14th July, relative to the request of King Ibn Sand for the assistance of His Majesty's Government in connexion with his desire to employ a British bank as a State bank in the Hejaz, I have to inform you that the Minister of the Hejaz and Nejd called at the Foreign Office on the 21st July and raised this question. He explained that King Ibn Sand was anxious to stabilise his currency and to set the finances of his country on a firm basis. His Majesty therefore desired to establish a State bank, and was most anxious to secure the services of a British bank for this purpose. He had accordingly decided to send a representative to England to interview suitable banking firms, and the representative selected, M. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi, was arriving in London that morning. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was informed that Sir Andrew Ryan had already reported King Ibn Saud s request for the assistance of His Majesty's Government in this matter, and that the necessary instructions had already been telegraphed to Sir A. Ryan with regard to the reply to be returned to His Majesty's enquiry. In that telegram Sir A. Ryan had been instructed to explain that, whilst His Majesty's Government fully appreciated and sympathised with the financial difficulties of the Hejazi Government, it was impossible for them to depart from their long-established practice of non-intervention in transactions between foreign Governments and British banks. In any case, in England, unlike certain other countries, the banks were wholly independent bodies, whose decisions His Majesty's Government were not in a position to influence. The banks would therefore reach a decision on any proposition which might be put before them on its commercial merits and not on political grounds. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government had suggested that King Ibn Saud should appoint a repre sentative in London to explore the matter with the banks direct. It appeared, from what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had said, that the King had already anticipated this advice. 3. The sheikh stated that he recognised the inability of His Majesty's Government to intervene with British banks, as explained above, but hinted that King Ibn Saud would be prepared to offer very substantial commercial concessions to any bank willing to consider the business. He also explained that, while the King personally, and he himself, were eager to put any business in British hands, the Russians were making efforts to establish themselves commercially in the Hejaz and interested persons were trying to persuade the King to deal with them. 4. The Minister was informed in reply that His Majesty's Government were aware that the Russians had been selling goods in parts of Arabia at a very low price. If they attempted to do this in the Hejaz it would not be possible for this country to compete with them, as British trade was in private hands and was run on a commercial basis. It was, of course, entirely for King Ibn Saud to decide whether or not he should encourage Russian activities in his dominions. 5. As a result of this conversation, it was arranged that M. Zade, of the Hejazi Legation, and M. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi should discuss the position at the Department of Overseas Trade on the 23rd July with members of that Depart ment. They then stated to the representatives of that Department that they were already in touch with the Eastern Bank, with which M. Abdur Rahman Qusaibi had had commercial dealings at Bahrein, and had also had a preliminary discussion with the Ottoman Bank. They would be glad if the Ottoman Bank could be informed that the Department of Overseas Trade were fully cognisant of the project. . [219 g-1]2 6. M. Zade was informed that the Department of Overseas Trade had been in touch with Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), who had large resources, and were already represented by branches in Egypt and the Sudan, and he was given a letter of introduction to this bank. It was, however, explained to the Hejazi representatives that there were relatively few banks with experience of their part of the world, and that it was probably undesirable from their point of view to discuss the matter with more than, at the outside, two or three banks, as otherwise there might be a danger that none would be inclined to give their proposals serious consideration.^ 7. The Department of Overseas Trade have since approached the Ottoman Bank, as requested by M. Zade, and have been informed that the Hejazi Govern ment's proposals are under consideration. 8. The Hejazi Minister has expressed his appreciation of the assistance rendered to him in this connexion. I am, &amp;c. ARTHUR HENDERSON.91 !

No. (83)] I have to inform you that the Minister of the Hejaz-Nejd, ao an interview with a member of this Department on the 4th September, stated that Abdurrahman Qusaibi had failed to come to terms with any British bank regarding the proposed establishment of a State Bank in the Hejaz. 2. The Minister added that the Hejazi Government, in spite of his explanations, refused to believe that His Majesty's Government were really, as they had stated, powerless to influence the British banks, and had apparently formed the opinion that His Majesty's Government were them selves disinclined to support the proposal; he was doing his best to disabuse his Government of this misconception. 3. Meanwhile, as he had spoken very frankly about the Hejazi Govern ment s project in the first instance, he wished to state confidentially that he had learnt unofficially that Abdurrahman Qusaibi had now proceeded to Holland where a Dutch bank was showing great interest in the matter and appeared ready to come to terms. In reply to a question, the Sheikh said that he understood that it was proposed that a loan should be made to the Hejazi Government secured on the receipts of the Jedda customs, and that the Netherlands bank would probably be allowed to appoint an official in the customs to safeguard their interests. No final agreement had yet been reached, but it seemed probable that one would not be long delayed. 4. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was informed that, as it had been impossible for this country to furnish King Ibn Saud with the financial help and faci lities he desired, His Majesty's Government could only welcome the fact that the requisite assistance seemed likely to be forthcoming from another quarter.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN ( A rabia ).

WITH reference to Mr. Henderson's despatch No. 308 of the 7th August, regarding a State Bank in the Hejaz, I have the honour to report that 1 learn confidentially from the local manager oi the Netherlands Trading Socie }, mo commonly known here as the Dutch Bank, that his principals in Ams er am seem to be seriously contemplating a loan of £500,000 to Ibn ^au , o e secured on customs receipts and conditioned by suitable concessions m matters ot handling and control of all public moneys. 2 Mr. Jacobs himself regards the purely economic and financial bases ot some such contract as sufficiently sound. He supplied me m confidence with the following figures of recent Hejazi revenue from customs, which he believes to he fairly accurate:— ^ * tt AH. 1347. AH. 1348. AH. 1349. £1,174,362 £998,263 £880,320 (The Moslem year 1349 ended last mid-May.) The details oi these sums, shown bv ports of entry, is attached. ^ 3 The political future, however, worried Mr. Jacobs profoundly, the moie so as there has recently been a further heavy spate of bazaar gossip about latent revolution in the towns of Hejaz and open revolt in the deserts of Nejd. It the Netherlands Trading Society decide against the venture the decision w: 11, 1 think be almost entirely due to their lack of belief in Ibn Sauds ability to maintain peace and his own position for a sufficient further period of time. 4 If the loan is made, 1 gather that £200,000 of it will be required either to peg the silver rial at its present fictitious value of 10 to the £ or to cover its drop to its silver -content value of lOd. A further £200,000 would, 1 am told, )e earmarked for economic development of a paying kind, the opening up oi mines, for example, a subject on which I hope to be in a position to report more full} by next bag. The remaining £100,000, they say, would be required to free Ibn Sand and his Government from all debt and set the machinery of State once more in working order.

High Commissioner for Palestine, My Lord, Jerusalem, June 11, 1931. IN confirmation of my telegram No. 51 of the 4th June, I have the honour to inform your lordship that King Hussein died at Amman at 3 a.m . on the 4th June. During his stay at Amman King Hussein had been visited from time to time by his sons King Faisal, King Aly, the Amir Zeid and other members of his family. 2. As soon as it was known that King Hussein's condition was desperate. King Aly informed Haj Amin Effendi-al-Husseini, the President of the Supreme Moslem Council, who was then at Amman, that it had been the wish of the family that King Hussein should be buried at Mecca, but that since the difficulties in the way of realising that wish were insuperable they desired that he should be buried in the Haram-esh-Sherif at Jerusalem. 3. Haj Amin Effendi welcomed the suggestion, and, on the eve of King Hussein's death, reported the fact to Government with the request that facilities should be accorded by the Palestine Government for the burial of King Hussein with all the honours due to the Arab ruler who had persuaded the Arabs to throw in their lot with the Allied Forces during the Great War. 1 caused Haj Amin Effendi to be informed that all proper facilities would be granted for the ceremony. 4. On the 4th June, at 10 a.m ., the body of King Hussein left Amman by motor-car. The cortege was formed of the sons and relatives of King Hussein, including King Aly, the Amir Abdullah, the Amirs Zeid, Shakir and Talal. The British Resident, Amman, the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion and many Arab notables were also present. Along the route from Amman to Jerusalem frequent halts were made to enable delegations of villagers to pay their respects to the dead King. The Amir Abdullah and King Aly were met at the Allenby Bridge on my behalf by Ruhi Bey Abdulhadi, assistant secretary, accompanied by a British police officer. The party was there joined by several delegations of Palestinian Arabs, representing different towns and bodies. 5. At 2 '20 p.m . the cortege reached Jerusalem and stopped at Herod s Gate, where Government representatives, members of the consular corps, ecclesiastical dignitaries, Arab notables awaited it. Representatives of the Chief Rabbinate and of the Executive of the Jewish Agency, although they had not been invited, were also in attendance. The Italian consul-general, who was also omitted from the list of invitations, was not present. 6. At Herod's Gate a procession was formed, headed by the band of the Arab Legion. The procession included the mayors of Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa and other towns, the consular body, delegations representing various Moslem and Christian societies from many parts of Palestine with their banners, and parties of bov scouts and schoolboys. The procession approached the Haram-esh-Sherif by the Damascus Gate and the old city. The streets and buildings along which it passed were crowded with interested spectators. I was represented in the procession by my private secretary and aide-de-camp. The acting chief justice, the chief secretary, the Officer Commanding, Transjordan Frontier Force and Heads of Departments were in attendance. Major Hubert Young, counsellor of the High Commission for Iraq, who happened to be in Jerusalem, was also present. A guard of honour was furnished by the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and saluted the coffin as it entered the old city at the Damascus Gate. [165 y—1]7. At 4 p.m . the coffin was carried into the Dome of the Rock, and imme diately afterwards the Amir Abdullah and King Aly received the Government representatives, consuls and other non-Moslem notables, who, after expressing' their sympathy with the Hashimite family, left the Haram Area. At 4 30 p.m . the coffin was carried to the Mosque of A1 Aqsa where, after the usual religious ceremonies, funeral orations were delivered by the president of the Supreme Moslem Council, Sheikhs Abdul Kader-al-Muzaffar, Issaf Eft'endi- al-Nashashibi and Dr. Khalid-al-Hakin. At about 5 p.m . the burial took place in a small and beautiful old mosque which abuts on the Haram Area a few yards from the tomb of Mohammad Ali and on its northern side. A window has been specially opened in the wall of the Haram to connect the tomb with the Haram Area. 8. No untoward incident of any kind occurred during the funeral; and the Amir Abdullah and King Aly expressed to me their deep appreciation of the arrangements made by the Government for the funeral of their father. Flags were flown at half-mast on Government buildings and at the Royal Air • Force and military stations and on the consular offices on the day of the funeral. 9. I invited King Aly and Amir Abdullah to dine and to spend the night at Government House. The King and the Amir expressed their gratitude for this invitation which they accepted. I have, &amp;c. J. R.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 137 of the 8th April, I have the honour to state that Fuad Bey Hamza did not revert to the question of the possible entry of Hejaz-Nejd into the League of Nations until the 8th July. He was on the point of returning to Mecca and was doubtful whether he could come back to Jedda before I went'on leave on the 20th July. He seemed very anxious in any case to get me to put something in writing. I was most reluctant to commit myself to this. I said that the question he put to me last year had been very carefully considered at home, and that I had material for further conversa tion but not, I thought, for a written communication. I promised to refresh my memory of a despatch I had received from you {i.e., your despatch under reference) and see what I could do. I mentioned in general terms slavery and the complicated legal questions involved. 2. A reperusal of your despatch after Fuad Bey left confirmed my reluctance to give him a written statement. The matters dealt with in para graphs 2 to 4 of your despatch are such that I could touch lightly on most of them in conversation, but could not deal with them in a letter without danger of indiscretion on my side and controversial rejoinder on the part of Fuad Bey. As regards paragraph 5 of your despatch, I dare say nothing at all at the present time, as you are reviewing the position in regard to Asir, and Fuad Bey has recently reminded me that Ibn Sand's claim to Aqaba and Maan remains juridically intact. I should, therefore, be limited in a written statement to the subject-matter of paragraphs 6 to 11 of your despatch, and here again I am confronted by the difficulty that, if I proceeded definitely on the conclusions stated by you, I might find that Fuad Bey had quite different conceptions regarding the constitutional position in this country. 3. After careful consideration I have addressed a personal letter to Fuad Bey, a copy of which I enclose. For many reasons I should prefer to postpone any further discussion with him until the end of the year, but my letter will enable him to judge whether it is worth his while to come to Jedda before I leave. If he does, I will try to ascertain whether Ibn Sand has any serious intention of seeking membership of the League, so that I may consider whether the Hejazi Government can be considered to have expressed a wish to join, within the meaning of the last sentence of your despatch under reference. At present I see no evidence of more than a wish to explore the subject, and even that wish may be merely a wish on the part of Fuad Bey personally. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Fuad Bey Hamza. (Private.) My dear Fuad Bey, Jedda, July 13, 1931. I GATHERED from our telephone conversation yesterday afternoon that you might not find it possible to visit Jedda before I leave on the 20th July. I have, therefore, written you letters on two of the questions you reopened on the 8th July, viz., the International Sanitary Convention and connected matters, and the Arms Traffic Convention. As regards the League of Nations, 1 find it difficult to follow the same course, because the apparently simple question that [219 m—7]you put in the letter you wrote to me last September turns largely on complicated le^al questions, which we could only elucidate in discussion. n If you could find time to come to Jedda, it would give me great pleasure to discuss the matter further. At the same time, I cannot well press you to come here specially for that purpose at any great inconvenience to yourselt, as our discussion could hardly be conclusive, though it would serve the very useiul purpose of providing each of us with material for further consideration. It may help you to decide whether to pursue the matter further or to post pone it until after I return, if I say that the legal question turns greatly on the constitutional relations between the Hejaz and Nejd, &amp;c., and the effect thereot on their international status. That is not the only subject T should mention m a conversation, but it has a very important bearing on the whole matter.,\\\ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIff BJRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT ; - EASTERN ( A rabia )!./ 7^/''/^/ -j August 12, 1931 CONFIDENTIAL. ^ ,-.J S ection 6.

I reminded Fuad Bey that, in his personal letter to me of the 7th Octobei last, he had limited himself to an enquiry as to the views of His Majesty s Govern ment regarding the legal position. I said that, although it was not for one Government to pronounce on a question which might concern the League as a whole, you had examined the matter carefully, with a view to giving the Mejaz- Neid Government what friendly assistance you could 3. I then gave Fuad Bey the gist of paragraphs 6 to 11 of your despatch No 137 of the 8th April, explaining that you had drawn certain conclusions trom the available data as to the character of the union between the Hejaz and Nejd and its dependencies, and had deduced therefrom the further concluhioiib, state in the second half of paragraph 10 of your despatch, as to the position of Hejaz- Neid in regard to possible membership of the League. _ . , i &gt; 4. Fuad Bey stated that the situation as between the Hejaz on the one hand and Neid &amp;c., on the other was undefined. He admitted that although a personal union might have been contemplated in 1926, the position had evolved and was still evolving, on such lines that the two countries could only be regarded as forming a single State. He inferred this from indications similar to those considered in your despatch and certain others which we discussed, ^ the increasing tendency to treat the whole country as a unit for administrative purposes He emphasised, however, the fact that the Constitution of the Hejaz still applied only to that country, and that there had been no new definition of the 0 5 For the reasons given in paragraph 2 of my despatch under reference, I said nothing to Fuad Bey about the requirements of the League that States applvimr for membership'must have established frontiers; nor did I revert to the question of slavery, as Fuad Bey is well aware from previous conversations of the views of His Majesty's Government on that subject. . ^ L1 . . . 6 In the course of the conversation I asked I uad Bey point-blank whether his Government had made up their minds to seek admission to the League or were merely exploring the possibility of their doing so. As I expected, he intimated that no decision had been taken; they were merely looking into the matter. Having elicited this information, I refrained from making the statement foie- shadowed in the last sentence of your despatch No. 137 of the 8th April. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.

Henderson.—{Received A ugust 18.) (No. 315.) Sir, Jedda, July 30, 1931. THE more critical of Ibn Saud Mr. Philby has felt, the more communicative he has become. Recent despatches of Sir A. Ryan's have traced the development of this tendency. A few evenings ago I learned its origin from Mr. Philby. 2. He had been stung, I think, into unwonted frankness by trouble over the Marconi contract. Trouble over the effective range of the wireless telephony is still to come; the present friction centring round the refusal of the Hejazi Govern- to take over the four mobile sets and their failure to pay three of the monthly instalments of £1,000 each. Mr. Philby was contemplating drastic measures, such as sending Mr. Boucicault out of the country. He was only deterred by the fact that all the material has arrived and is in Hejazi hands, and by the fear that they would begin monkeying with it themselves. 3. He led the conversation on to financial matters in general and Ibn Sand's incompetence in particular. While the pilgrim hosts were stoning the devil at Muna, the King held meeting after meeting to discuss the problem of the nickel exchange. Mr. Philby attended them, silent but increasingly indignant. After much talk one day, it must have been the 30th April, the King ordained that the Saudi piastre should henceforth stand at 44 to the rial; its par value was 22, but it had dropped into the SO's; everyone applauded the King's wisdom and his fiat went forth. On the next day, after much further talk, the King decided that the piastre should stand at 22 and accepted equal applause irom the same advisers. Mr. Philby was furious, but waited until the King had left to tell the sycophants what he thought of them. On the following day the King, whose ears are long, chaffed him beyond endurance. After a heated discussion, Mr. Philby was sent out into the streets with a gold sovereign and a silver rial in his hand and told to prove his assertion that, whatever His Majesty might ordain, not one of his subjects would sell a silver rial for 22 pieces of nickel. In vain he pointed out to the King that what he wanted for this purpose was only a handful of nickel. Ibn Saud, he maintains, simply could not understand so simple a monetary point. He left in disgust at the ignorance of Ibn Saud and the suppleness of his advisers, and has but rarely see the King since then. The incident may well have been distorted by Mr. Philby, but there is probably enough truth in it to make it interesting. Its relation is certainly illuminating. 4. Mr. Philby was not less cynical about the impossibility of obtaining banking facilities for this country, though rather more guarded. It had been understood that he was interested in Lutfullah's Bank to the extent of urging its advantages on Ibn Saud (see paragraph 7 of Sir A. Ryan's despatch No. 177 of the 15th May). He now holds Lutfullah up to ridicule as that inordinately vain individual who, in King Hussein's day, had himself named his Ambassador at Rome and paid for the privilege not only his own salary, but those of an imposing suite. Mr. Philby has even stated that the banker is now bankrupt. His attitude seems to be one of general disillusionment. The King has feet of mud. The country, in National Conference, has ruled out anything in the nature of a State Bank. So much the worse for Lutfullah. 5. Mr. Philby also spoke of the benzine contract, to which Sir A. Ryan referred in paragraph 7 of his despatch No. 280 of the 12th July. He affirmed that, after threatening to close down his Legation and to have himself withdrawn, u- the Russian Minister had at length succeeded in securing the contract but nothing V \ more that is nothing in the nature of more favourable terms for the entr^ of Russian goods. The Hejazi Government had agreed to buy 50,000 cases of A !V^ A _ . // [219 s—2] w2 benzine at 1-50 dollars a case, to be paid for in three instalments at three-month intervals beginning three months after delivery. This agreement will enable the Hejazi Government to ensure something over a half-year's supply of their fuel needs. It is almost certain that no business house could afford to supply on these terms, unless at a deliberate loss. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE-GILL.W !

WITH reference to Mr. Henderson's despatch No. 308 of the 7th August, regarding a State Bank in the Hejaz, I have the honour to report that I leam confidentially from the local manager of the Netherlands 1 rading Society, more commonly known here as the Dutch Bank, that his principals in Amsterdam seem to be seriously contemplating a loan of £500,000 to Ibn Saud, to be secured on customs receipts and conditioned by suitable concessions in matters ot handling and control of all public moneys. 2. Mr. Jacobs himself regards the purely economic and financial bases ot some such contract as sufficiently sound. He supplied me in confidence with the following figures of recent Hejazi revenue from customs, which he believes to be fairly accurate;— AH. 1347. AH. 1348. AH. 1349. £1,174,362 £998,263 £880,320 (The Moslem year 1349 ended last mid-May.) The details of these sums, shown bv ports of entry, is attached. 3. The political future, however, worried Mr. Jacobs profoundly, the more so as there has recently been a further heavy spate of bazaar gossip about latent revolution in the towais of Hejaz and open revolt in the deserts of Nejd. If the Netherlands Trading Society decide against the venture, the decision w:ll, 1 think, be almost entirely due to their lack of belie! in Ibn Saud s ability to maintain peace and his own position for a sufficient further period of time. 4. If the loan is made, I gather that £200,000 of it will be required either to pe' 1 the silver rial at its present fictitious value of 10 to the £ or to cover its drop to its silver-content value of UW. A further £200,000 would, I am told, be earmarked for economic development oi a paying kind, the opening up of mines, for example, a subject on w 7 hich I hope to be in a position to report moie full} bv next bag.

I TOOK occasion of the recent visit of the Under-Secretary for foreign Affairs to Jedda to ask him what he could tell me about the benzine contract, which his finance colleague was supposed to have signed with the Soviet Legation. His face fell, his manner lost its habitual assurance, and he retired into 1928 to gain time. He reminded me that in that year Ibn Saud had instructed him to broach with Mr. Bird the subject of fostering British trade with the Hejaz as an offset to the Soviet attempts to break into the closed Hejazi market. Yes, I said, a favourable commercial treaty was sought as a quid pro quo. No, he said, lie had been misunderstood, more than that had been hoped for ; but he did not specify what. Instead, he passed on to expatiate on the brave show that the King had put up against Soviet pressure, unaided and alone, until circumstances had at last become too strong for him. (Here 1 reminded him that the show was made not so much for our bright eyes as for the black looks of the Nejdi brethren and the Hejazi tradesmen at the mere mention of bolshevism and Soviet goods. He gave me right—up to a point.) 2. At last, however, His Majesty had been forced to yield in one particular to the Soviet pressure. Unable to make a satisfactory contract on the one side for State fuel needs, and threatened on the other by the withdrawal of the Soviet Legation from Jedda, his Ministers had made the best of a bad job and contracted to buy £30,000 worth of Russian benzine, and on very favourable terms too. I suggested that they had 1 been both bluffed and led into the way ot further concession. He admitted the first as a possibility, but denied hotly that any further concession was possible When I reminded him that in spite of the total denial of entry to Russian goods, Russian matches were sold openly everywhere and Russian cement was not unknown, he made the curious statement that it was quite true that the prohibition was enforced and that at the same time there was a four fold duty on all Russian goods—a position easily understood in Jedda. He then said frankly that the financial situation was rotten, but he did not think it was hopeless. He himself had received no salary since March. 3. T have since received sidelights on the benzine contract from Herr de Haas, the German trading consul. He has recently returned from leave, having spent a month of it in Moscow haggling with the Soviet authorities for the right to run their contract on a commission basis. Under pressure of his threat to undercut them with still cheaper Roumanian oil, they played him with long negotiations up to the point of agreement, which they then refused; having in the meantime succeeded in securing their contract in Jedda^by negotiation with the Hejazi Government through their Minister. So keen were they to have it signed before Herr de Haas could return to Jedda to seduce Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman with his yet cheaper Roumanian oil, that two commercial plenipotentiaries arrived here with the same object. Comrade Jurgieff, representing Wosgostveg (Eastern Trading Society), came up from the south from Hodeida, and shortly afterwards Comrade Hertig (or Gertig), of Sojusneftiexport (Soviet Naphtha Export, a branch of Sojusneftsyndikat), arrived hot-foot from Europe. I understand that the exact terms of the contract are the purchase by the Hejazi Government of 60,000 8-gallon cases of benzine at 6^. 6^. a case c.i.f., and 40,000 8-gallon cases of kerosene at 5s. 3d. a case c.i.f., their total cost of £30,000 to be paid in four equal instalments at two-month intervals, the first quarter to be paid on delivery. This is now expected shortly. 4. I learn that in anticipation of the delivery. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman has already concluded an advance sale in Mecca of 2,000 cases of benzine at £1 apiece. This is the normal market price in the Hejaz, and shows a clear profit to the sheikh's treasury of 200 per cent., with the added benefit of cash down against an unmatured debt. It is surprising that the Hejazis have not fallen sooner to such [246 ff—1]a lure. Their inherent aversion to bolshevism, their interested stand against Soviet trade, and M. Turakulov's persistent efforts to obtain further concessions have probably been the main factors of delay. 5. In Jedda a humbler method obtains for raising the wind. The merchants having now been relieved, on loan, of nearly all their cash, are required to lend their stock-in-trade to the local treasury official. He thereupon knocks it down at auction for what it will fetch, spot cash. I am assured that this means was resorted to in order to pay for the official dinner with which the Finance Minister was greeted on his recent return from Medina. Little wonder that the local tradesmen feel sore, so sore that even the venerable Governor of Jedda, himself a merchant who has been heavily dunned for loans, hailed the Indian vice- consul in full market the other day and asked him how he could evade further extortion. As the Governor is very deaf, the Munshi w T as much embarrassed for reply. 6. With regard to expenditure, I hear through a credible channel that Ibn Sand is no whit less extravagant than before, and that observers at Riadh are shocked 1 at his lavish hunting parties. His Minister in London, on the other hand, has recently been telegraphing for funds. The arrangement with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. for the supply of credit to cover the needs of missions abroad (Sir A. Ryan's despatch No. 291 of the 16th July) was not concluded after all, but I learn confidentially from the manager of the local Dutch bank that the Finance Minister succeeded during the last week of August in collecting £300, which the bank remitted to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Fortunately the season is over. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE-GILL.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (A rabia ). October 13, 1931 CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 2. u : [E 5141/1600/25] No. 1. Mr. Hope-Gill to the Marquess of Reading.—{Received October 13.) (No. 375.) My Lord, Jedda, September 30, 1931. I HAVE the honour to report that Mr. Philby, or rather Hajji Abdullah St. John Philby, has returned unexpectedly from Riadh, and in the course of several conversations has given me some interesting sidelights on the internal situation in this country. 2. There seems little doubt but that Ibn Saud and he get badly on each other's nerves. He left with all his baggage and instruments in two cars running on a three-quarter paraffin mixture. In full desert they ran out of even this modest admixture of benzine, and Mr. Philby subsisted on dates and insufficient water until relief came from Taif. Arrived there, he learned of the misappropriation of the whole of the Standard Oil Company's benzine stock at Jedda, for which he is agent. Although he pretended on his arrival here that the seizure was the result of previous arrangement by him with the Director-General of Finance, he confessed to me last night that he had been faced with a fait accompli and that all he could do was to write it up with the other debts owing to him by the Hejazi Government. These, he said, now amount to some £50,000, £12,000 of which represent the value of this and previous consignments from Standard Oil. He holds no drafts on customs nor even promissory notes. If the Government swims he hopes eventually to be paid. If it sinks, he fears that he must sink with it. He has staked his all on Ibn Saud. 3. This makes it all the more striking that he should criticise him so unfavourably to a third person. He describes the King as disheartened in spirit, disillusioned in mind, and approaching impotence in body. This last discomfort seems to poison his whole outlook, so that he has become morose and reticent, withdrawing himself for the greater part of the day into the quarters outside Riadh, where he keeps his slaves and concubines, spending long nights with one or other of his wives, and only finding relaxation between whiles in the company of a few Bedouin cronies where the talk is of w T omen and camels. Although he used even in Riadh to devote anything up to ten hours a day to current affairs, he seems now to have lost all interest in them and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin moons about with nothing to do. These activities and this indolence indicate to Mr. Philby that Ibn Saud, in the fifty-first year of a strenuous sexual career, has reached a stage of conflict between desire and its fulfilment. The male climacteric, maybe. 4. He also has discovered, to his intense disappointment, that the King lies to him, not out of malice, he thinks, but because his moral fibre has weakened and he no longer holds a strict regard for truth. He instances the misappropriation of his benzine, with which he is convinced Ibn Saud was fully conversant. As another instance, he states that Ibn Saud told him that M. Boucicault had com pleted one wireless station north of Medina and was moving on to the next. Mr. Philby now learns that M. Boucicault has, until quite recently, again been held up by lack of benzine for his convoy, this time at A1 Ula, whence he had been insistently telegraphing for supplies, and that he was only now able to move on to Tabuk to begin work on the first station. The Marconi payments, incidentally, are four months in arrear. 5. Mr. Philby's sidelights on the Yemen trouble are illuminating. He was with the King and Yusuf Yasin when the new T s of Imamic encroachment was received. They pored over large-scale maps and Mr. Philby pointed out that Arwa, the village reported as occupied, apparently lay on the Yemen side of the Jebel Razih watershed. Ibn Saud would have none of it and for some days while w r aiting for further news he pondered plans for a sweeping desert attack on Sana from the north-east. Mr. Philby was doing his best to show that there was no casus belli, but he gained the firm impression that Ibn Saud was intending to attack the Imam at all costs—a providential means, he added, of employing a [273 n—2]host of hungry Bedouin who hung round Riadh and complained of taxation when he suddenly changed his attitude and became conciliatory. laskedMr.Philby later on whether, if such a juncture were to occur again, a friendly w r ord from us w r ould have any value; he replied that it would undoubtedly be deeply resented. He is evidently less than ever in the King's confidence. I must report, in this connexion, that at the end of our conversation of the 19th September f uad Hamza made a point of telling me how grateful Ibn Sand had been for His Majesty s Government's friendlv gesture of advice. 6. Mr. Philby lias spoken much of the King, but what J have written summarises his views sufficiently for the purpose of this report. He also spoke ot Fuad Bey as having now lost such influence as he had. He pictures him at Taif as withdrawn from contact with current affairs of State and spending his time in writing a handbook on the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies. My own impression is that he knows much less than formerly of what is passing and that his office has largely become a letter-box for receiving and despatching to the ' competent authorities ' the correspondence of the foreign representatives. The French vice-consul, who had to transact all the current business for his hermit Charge d'Affaires on the occasion of the Amir Feisal's recent visit to Jedda, found Fuad Bey ready to discuss the attractions of the post of Minister at Paris. I think that M Durmanjay initiated this subject, a point which may have significance of another kind. 7. Mr. Philby confirmed my growing conviction that the Director-General of Finance is now for all practical purposes ' the Hejazi Government. He still has the King's blind confidence. He moves about the central Hejaz, the only moving point and the sole motive force in an area of complete stagnation, collecting means from the merchants in cash or kind and disposing of it none knows how. Holding the purse-strings, he controls everything except the ' Umm-al-Qura,' which he has tried to capture but failed in face of the Syrian party,' which still has enough means to produce the paper. An essential department w^hich Abdullah Suleiman is said to be deliberately starving is the Post and Telegraphs. In spite of the Finance Department's hauls of benzine, the Jedda-Mecca-Taif mails have now for a fortnight been carried by donkeys. The Eastern Telegraph Company's account is mounting up and nothing has been paid since the end of May. It is Mr. Philby's opinion that, for all his secretive activity, Abdullah Suleiman is near the end of his tether and cannot reach the beginning of the pilgrimage season. I learn that he is shortly going to Riadh. 8. If he goes, the Hejaz will lapse into a state of anarchic torpor under the figure-headship of the Viceroy. The urban populations will sit w T ith fatalistic eyes turned towards a pilgrimage which they know will be minimum. The only movement which may be expected is from soldiery and police who, lacking pay wherewith to buy food, have the powder to take it. I have, &amp;c. C. G.

For the benefit of Shaikh Ahmad no doubt, the mes engers were told of the strained relations existing between Kejd and Yemen, and that as a precautionary measure the Qahtan tribe and Khalid ibn Luai had been-4- been detailed to move towards the North-East frontier of Temen but tfcat, as the news of a settlenent had appear ed hopeful, he, Bin Saud t had ordered his forces to stand fast# Bin 3aud further informed the messengers that if he heard that 'Ifubara were plentiful in the Uutair country he would come up to ^afa shortly# IV# Islamic Co ngress in Jerusalem, The Shaikh of Kuwait on 2nd December (rather late in the day) informed the Political ^gect that he had received an invitation half-way throu# Kovember, from Haj Amin al Huscaini, the ^rand Ilufti in Jerusalem to attend in person the Conference due to take place there on 7th December.

On 10th a telegram was received from the Charg'e D'Affairs Jedf ah to the effect that the Hejd Government reported that the two youths had been arrested between Kuwait and Zubair, and desired their release. The Political i^gent replied aaying they were in Basrah, and had nowhere been arrested. Copies of these telegrams are submitted with this for information.

(No. 444.) Sir, Jedda, November 17, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram No. 241 of the 14th November regarding the financial situation, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the Royal proclamation, or letter, as it is familiarly styled, announcing budgetary reform. 2. The opening phrases are somewhat misleading. The King poses as having obeyed the call of duty. In reality he has disobeyed it for months. He states that he took the initiative in informing himself of the whole situation. In reality it was his second son, egged on by his Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, no doubt stimulated in his turn by Mr. Philby's and his own personal animosity towards his financial colleague, who spurred His Majesty into belated activity by forcing upon him a great deal of unpalatable information. Ibn Saud states that the information was submitted through the Minister, more properly Director- General, of Finance. In reality it accompanied him to Riadh as unwelcome evidence of his guilt, which he has evidently failed to disprove. Towards the end of his letter the King informs his people that he has kept his Finance Minister at Riadh in the interests of the finances of Nejd; his people know better, or think they do. They do not believe that Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman will be released for a long time, but Fuad Bey Hamza has told me that it is only too true that he will soon return. He, with Yusuf Yasin, is making the most of Abdullah Suleiman's absence. 3. I was asked to call at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs here on the 13th November to meet Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who had arrived post-haste from Riadh overnight. The glad news of reform was broken to me, followed by the less gratifying news of a virtual moratorium on all Government debts, internal and external, and rounded off by an invitation to His Majesty's Government to stand on a footing of equality with all other creditors in the matter of the 1929 debt to the Government of India. 4. I enquired what part of the revenue was to be devoted to funding these debts, how much it would amount to, and what period was calculated to be ■necessary for the liquidation of the current indebtedness. Only in the matter of proportion were any figures available. The total revenues, it appears, are to be classified under four headings to meet four main objects, as follows ;— (1) Official salaries, 35 per cent. This was explained to me as covering all the normal costs of administration. (2) Indebtedness, 25 per cent. This was to cover all arrears of salaries, as well as the internal and external debt of the Hejazi Government. (3) Reserve, 15 per cent. This is a notable novelty, which will have all the attraction of a pot of honey. _ (4) Extraordinary expenses, 25 per cent. This is intended to ensure the comfort and health of pilgrims and to develop the country's hidden resources. 5. As regards approximate figures, I could be given no information. Much spade work remained to be done. But as regards the length of time which it would take to pay off current debts, Fuad Bey informed me—Yusuf Yasin having by then gone to say his prayers—that they calculated it at about two years. In reporting the matter to you in my telegram under reference, I therefore suggested that the concurrence of His Majesty's Government with this still further post poned repayment of the Government of India debt might be made conditional on the production of a satisfactory budget estimate. 6. I have already reported in the same telegram the Hejazi Government's attitude towards the other outstanding British credits, namely, the costs of the MacDonnell investigation, the account with the Eastern Telegraph Company, and [327 d—1] mithe two classes of debts owing to Messrs. Gellatly, Hatikey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited). 1 have as yet nothing more to add. 7. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Bey Hamza spent two busy days in negotiation with the Government s other creditors in Jedda. I fear that they have gone too fast. A great diversity of categories of indebtedness and conditions of security and treatment has been brought to light, but nothing has been reduqed to writing, and the sheikh and the bey have now returned to Mecca with views and intentions which undoubtedly conflict with the impressions they have left behind them with the creditors here. 8. One further point of interest has emerged. It is intended to make Jedda the chief centre of financial control, and hopes are still entertained of securing the services of a Dutchman as financial adviser. My Dutch colleague seems less hopeful. 9. The reform, in short, is late, perhaps too late, in time, drastic in theory, and reducible in practice to the low levels of local diligence and integrity. Moreover, it is not obvious how Ibn Saud himself will live, unless he lives on the salaries of his officials, the funded debts, the pilgrims, or the reserve. I did not broach the delicate question which. I have, (fee. C. G. HOPE GILL. Enclosure in No. 1. (Translation.) Extract from ' Umm-al-Qura ' of November 13. 1931 (3/7/1350). P roclamation. (After compliments.) IT is known to all that the world crisis has affected every part of the globe, and every person, each in the measure of his capacity, is trying to put it right. We, for our part, must do our duty and the duty of our Government in the Hejaz- Nejd and its Dependencies, by alleviating the effects of this crisis, and by resisting them as far as is possible, and by such means as the country and the Government can bear. We therefore ordered our Viceroy to furnish us with detailed information regarding the whole situation, in general and in particular, and to explain and to submit this to us through the Minister of Finance and the Vice-Acting President of the Legislative Council, who arrived here a few days ago and gave us details of the financial situation. God Almighty has now helped us to arrive at an organisation of income and expenditure. Expenditure has been weighed against income in the most advantageous fashion, and revenues of the Government have been divided up and classified under four headings, each according to its needs :— 1. Official Salaries. 2. Indebtedness. 3. Reserve. 4. Extraordinary Expenses (not decided upon). Instructions have accordingly been laid down and arrangements co-ordinated for the collection and conservation of these revenues, with a view to their being disbursed under the specific headings. The quotas allocated under the regula tions and instructions confirmed by us are to be adhered to in such a manner that no person will be preferred to another in the matter of drawing or disbursing any money from the Treasury. Under these regulations the principle has been laid down that salaries and debts shall be settled in equality amongst all persons. Strict orders have been issued that this principle must be observed, and that any person infringing these instructions, orders and regulations shall be severely punished. The budget will, please God, be sufficient to ensure the dues of ail officials, inhabitants and claimants of the different categories, certain items of expenditure having been reduced and certain items of revenue having been increased in very reasonable proportions. It depends for this on the principal revenue of the country, which the Government are endeavouring, by all the materialand intellectual means at their disposal, to foster and augment, with a view to its becoming the main source of Government income. It has been arranged that the undetermined portion of the income shall be spent on its own objects, such as securing the comfort of pilgrims, facilitating their journey and preparing sanitary measures, and all such things as may bring tranquillity and happiness to them and the people of the country. In order that the affairs and interests of the inhabitants may lie within the scope of the sacred religious law and the regulations which depend therefrom, we have ordered our Viceroy and the Council of Ministers over which he presides to be watchful in carrying out our orders, as regards the maintenance of peace and of justice and equity amongst the people without distinction between the strong and the weak; to follow our instructions as regards the improvement of finance; and to ensure that every person shall have his rights without delay or negligence. We have ordered Yusuf Yasin to convey all the instructions and orders in this respect to the Viceroy in the Hejaz, so that he will see that they are notified and complied with attentively. We have also ordered the Minister of Finance and Vice-President of the Legislative Council to remain here in order to consider certain financial affairs relating to Nejd and its Dependencies and then to return to their work. We have left the door open, thank God, to everyone who has any complaint and wishes to report. It has already been proved to all that we do not fail to examine any claim in accordance with the religious law. Relying upon God, we invite all Governors and officials to follow the right path and the straight way in their procedure for the interests of the people and the Government. We pray that God may grant success to all. Amen ! ABDUL AZIZ-AL-ABDURRAHMAN-AL-FEISAL.

Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 4, 1932.) (No. 482.) ^ r ' Jedda, December 13, 1931. IN my despatch No. 444 of the 17th November, 1 had the honour to report on the financial situation as affected by the issue of Ibn Sand's proclamation announcing budgetary reform. In my printed letter No. 460 of the 30th November was transmitted a series of announcements which resulted from the proclamation and which were published in the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 20th; they conveyed the King 's commands to reduce expenditure, select a Reorganisation Committee, cieate a Ireasury Department, and appoint a treasurer, and meanwhile to employ the Director-General of Finance and the Vice-President of the Hejazi Legislative Assembly in an inspectional tour of the other side of Nejd. 2. I now have the honour to enclose a translation of a leading article from the ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 4th December entitled 'Between Two Epochs; Memorable Deeds of His Majesty, (') as well as a more restrained but not very illuminating announcement on ' The New Budget.'(') 3. The two epochs are, of course, the evil past, relieved only by the King's good deeds, and the radiant future in both this world and the next. The memorable deeds of His Majesty are five in number. First and foremost is his constitution of a council of four under-secretaries of State, having collective and individual responsibility under the presidency of his Viceroy; the second is his establishment of a budget; the third, the assessment of the Government's assets and liabilities; the fourth, the concentration of all revenue in a central Treasury and its allotment to various defined objects; and, fifthly, measures of economy in the personnel and expenditure of Government departments. These are not the 'first proofs which His Majesty has given of his Islamic sincerity, his Arabic zeal, and his devotion to his people, but thev now effectively discharge his conscience of his obligations towards Allah and the country. In another extract which is also enclosed, from the 'Umm-al-Qura' of the 27th November, the editor deems it worthy of glorification and praise that His Majesty has also commanded the reduction of his personal expenses to an exceeding degree as a further proof of his democratic principles. 4. All this has meant a lot of work for the only Under-Secretary of State in action, Fuad Bey Hamza, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin having returned to Riadh. He is naturally elated by the success of his efforts to break the Abdullah Suleiman regime, create a budget, and constitute a central organ of responsibility and control. It is still too soon to say that the reforms will work, however. There is such a remarkable lack of adequate men and money, and so little prospect of supplementing either deficiency, that they will certainly have a hard struggle to survive. Pessimism is general. Few believe that the creation of a budget and the establishment of a Treasury under a bankrupt of 35, whom there was not enough money to send as first secretary to The Hague, offer any guarantee of honest or capable financial management. Various and curious arrangements are being come to with the more pushing of the Government's creditors. The budget is to date from the 12th December (the 1st Shaban) but no figures are given, promised or even surmised. When the dust of all this unwonted activity settles, it will probably simply be seen that the landmarks have shifted but the desert is much the same. I have, &amp;c. C G. HOPE GILL.

I . ■ —1 [E 165/165/25 i ffo*!. iS/r A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 11, 1932.) (No. 492.) Sir, Jedda, December 28, 1931. SINCE my return to Jedda on the 15th December, I have endeavoured to obtain a general view of the economic and financial situation in this country. Although I can add little to the information already in your possession, I think ^ it worth while to attempt a comprehensive picture of what I find after an absence of five months. In drawing it I have not had the advantage of any contact with high Government circles, for, as you know, the King remains at Riadh and most of his advisers have been summoned thither, including Fnad Bey Hamza, who left Mecca for Nejd almost simultaneously with my arrival in Jedda. The only Hejazi personage of any consequence whom I have seen is the rich old Governor of Jedda, who hardly counts as an official any longer. Though still to some extent employed as a consultant on great occasions, he now concerns himself little with the current affairs of his office, so that his outlook is less that of a Government servant than of a merchant. It is no secret that, as a business man and an — important creditor of the Government, he views the situation in the country with anxiety and ill-concealed hostility to the present regime. 2. It is generally agreed that the economic position in the country as a whole could hardly be worse. The merchants in Jedda and Mecca have been increasingly embarrassed during the past two years. Of late, they have had to cope not only with depression in trade, but with Government demands for contributions in money or in kind, extorted ostensibly on loan but without any definite prospect of repayment of the money or payment for the goods. Some carry large stocks {e.cj., of rice) owing to over-importation earlier this year and in 1930. Monetary crises elsew T here have created a feeling of uncertainty, the net result of which is to create further depression, although there have been passing effects of a contrary kind, e.g., the abandonment of the gold standard by His Majesty's Government and consequent depreciation of the rupee gave a temporary fillip to the import trade from India. The prices of most imported goods, reckoned in gold, have risen considerably during my absence, though those of local food-stuffs appear to be fairly steady. 3. I am assured that among the tribes, and especially those in the north of the Hejaz, the utmost misery prevails. It is impossible to sift the information, but it is said that, what with the reaction of world conditions, manifested more particularly in the greatly reduced pilgrimage, and the demands of the Government for military purposes, there has been a great depletion of live-stock. I hear of a reduction in the number of camels and of sheep and goats being sold off at ludicrously small prices. Attention is drawn to the influx of half-starved Bedouin into the larger towns, especially, perhaps, Medina, and to the frequent ^ spectacle of hungry tribesmen collecting at the halts on the main road from Jedda to that place. In August I was inclined to doubt the tales of actual starvation, which, it will be remembered, were related by the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, among others. Early in September the Mecca newspaper ' Umm-al-Qura,' a Government-inspired organ, thought it worth while to contradict a report of famine in the Hejaz which had been circulated in India. In view of what I now hear, I can no longer disregard the reiterated statements made to me regarding hunger and increased mortality. To give one example, possibly exaggerated, I am told of Bedouin dying in Medina at the rate of thirty-five V a day. 4. There is little or no prospect of relief being afforded by the 1932 pilgrimage. Some months ago I thought that the number of overseas pilgrims might attain the 1931 figure of about 40.000. though it was unlikely to exceed it. The Government have exerted themselves to stimulate the flow by propaganda, including the announcement of reduced charges and an almost firm promise that Pilgrimage Day will fall on a Friday. Nevertheless, it now looks as though the r 354 1—1 Itotal number of overseas pilgrims may be nearer 20,000 than 40,000. it is too soon to make deiinite estimates, as the number of Indians and Egyptians is always doubtful up to a very short time before the great day, which should tall on or about the 15th April next year, I p to the present, however, only 2,500 pilgrims have arrived from the Dutch East indies, always first in the held. 1 he Nether lands Legation surmises that this represents about half the total for the season, which would thus be about 5,000 as compared with about 16,000 this year. 5. Hopes are still founded on the possible development of new resources, the recently discovered or rediscovered water, petroleum and gold. The American expert, Mr. Twitchell, followed the procession of high officials to Riadh on the 15th December. The one concrete result of his efforts so far has been the erection of an undoubtedly hue and happily cheap American windmill at the Waziria wells some miles from Jedda, and some quite useful work on the old conduits connecting them with the town, it seems uncertain whether the water is to be used to supply Jedda or for agricultural purposes. Of the gold and petroleum 1 know nothing new nor have i heard any more of the separate proposal to employ Swedish experts to investigate the petroleum. 1 turn to the financial situation of the Government. Mr. Hope Gill has kept you very fully informed on this subject in a series of despatches ending with his No. 482 of the 13th December, i need not therefore go into the details of the reform schemes which have been so greatly advertised. The general opinion is that, even if revenue prospects were steadier and even if Ibn Sand had men capable of running a rational financial system, the scheme has come too late. The revenue from direct taxation of pilgrims must necessarily diminish. There must be a further decline in customs revenue owing to the falling ofi of pilgrims and general depression. In his despatch No. 346 of the 29th August Mr. Hope Gill gave figures from a well-informed source showing that the customs receipts had fallen from nearly £1,200,000 in the lunar year ending about the 8th June, 1929, to less than £900,000 in that ending about the 18th May, 1931 One of my more pessimistic informants puts the figure as low as £400,000 this vear. This may be an underestimate, but i doubt whether a customs revenue of more than half a million can be counted on for the year ending next May. The customs receipts, such as they are, might be used as security for a foreign loan, but only if the lenders could rely on some more or less independent control being established and on a greater prospect of durability than the Saudian regime at present offers. As you are aware, the negotiations with the Dutch Bank broke down and there seems to be no longer any likelihood of a loan being obtained from any European source on commercial lines. Contradictory rumours are in circulation regarding the relations between the Government here and Soviet Russia, which might alone engage in trade or even finance on uneconomic lines. The Russian Minister went on long leave a couple of months ago and may not return, though he is officially due back in April. He has been temporarily replaced by a non-Moslem from Leningrad, a man of intelligence and I gather some importance in Soviet circles. This gentleman, M. Horace balkind, is yer\ much out for information, but he cannot go in person to Mecca as the Minister used to do. My impression is that, although the Russians have brought ofl the coup of selling benzine and petroleum on credit and although there are other Russian goods in the market, e.g., matches, there is little big business doing _ between the Soviets and the Hejazi Government. 7. The proposal to supplement the reform scheme by employing a European adviser still holds the field, i am told that M. Jacobs, the manager of the Dutch Bank here, now on leave, was offered the post at a salary of £1,000 a year. It was subsequently offered to another Dutchman, it is not yet certain how he has reacted, but the Netherlands Charge d'Affaires thinks it unlikely that he will accept, especially as the present idea is said to be to get someone to undertake the reorganisation of the finances without fixed remuneration, but with the prospect of a fat present from the King when he has accomplished his task. , . , - „ i j 8. Meanwhile, the reform scheme is there for all to see and to study as far as they can do so without any information as to the budget which has been adopted.' The revenue, x, is to be divided into percentages assigned to current expenditure, floating debt, reserve and extraordinary expenditure including apparently betterment schemes. The new budget is to operate as from the first-day of the current lunar month, i.e., about the 9th December. Fromthis it looks as though the large arrears of salaries due on that date were to go into floating debt, not a very practicable arrangement, if it is contemplated, having regard to the penury among officials. 9. I take the opportunity of giving some account of the repercussion in the Hejaz of the sterling crisis, following on the local currency crisis described in the despatches which I wrote in the spring and early summer. It will be remembered that early in the year the Government concentrated its efforts on an attempt to maintain the recognised elements in the local currency at the official rates, viz., £1 gold =10 silver riyals = 22() piastres nickel current, and that this attempt broke down as regards the gold-silver parity, although silver did not slump quite as badly as might have been expected. In my despatch No. 286 of the 14th July, I forwarded a communique defining to some extent the monetary policy on the basis of maintaining the above rates arid fixing corresponding rates for other currencies in general use, which were to be still tolerated, including the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee These decisions produced no effect as against market conditions and the communique is now mainly of historical interest only. When the United Kingdom went off the gold standard, the curious position arose that the Hejaz possessed an official gold currency in the shape of English sovereigns side by side with its own silver. The Hejazi Government were as incapable as most people of understanding the implications of such a situation, much less devising a policy to deal with it. On the 16th October they announced a prohibition of the export of gold, except by permission of the Government (see Mr. Hope Gill's despatch No. 404 of the 19th October). It was subsequently announced that the authorities empowered to grant permits for the export of gold were the customs authorities and that detailed instructions, which I have not seen, would be issued later. I understand that the principle was to allow gold to leave the country only on a guarantee being given that an equivalent quantity of goods would be imported within three months. Apart from this prohibition, the currency situation was allowed to work itself out under the influence of market conditions. For a time, it was possible in certain transactions, for gold and sterling to be treated as equivalent, but this could obviously be neither general nor lasting. Gold tended to become scarce in the local market. Sterling and Egyptian notes came into increasing use. The respective values, as expressed in riyals, adapted themselves more or less to European exchange conditions, gold at a high premium and the various paper issues at rates determined by their relation to sterling with slight local variations resulting presumably from demand, supply and native ideas as to the confidence they might inspire. At the time of writing the approximate rates in the bazaars here are as follows :— £ gold =17^ riyals. £ sterling = 18-| riyals. £ Egyptian =13 riyals. 19 rupees = £ 1 gol d. 10. I can best complete this account of the currency situation by giving a string of isolated facts, not all of which I can interpret, as follows :— {a) As already stated gold has tended to disappear from the market. This is in part attributed to hoarding. It is possible that some has been sent to Riadh, where the King is believed by some to be accumulating a reserve of treasure. Gold has also been taken off the market by the Dutch Bank, which for several weeks past has been buying. This bank normally sends a shipment of gold to Europe after the pilgrimage. Its present policy of buying may be due to a desire on the part of the head office to hold part of their gold reserve in Jedda. Fluid gold is required for various local purposes and the depletion has been sufficiently marked to produce a recent enquiry by a firm here for a quotation for gold sovereigns from abroad delivered in Jedda. \h) The Soviet Legation here has been selling sterling notes in considerable quantities. The origin of the notes and the object of the Legation are obscure. Fears have been expressed lest the notes should not be all genuine, but I have not heard it seriously suggested so far that any of the notes here have been forged.(c) When the announcement on monetary policy sent home in my above- mentioned despatch iSo. 280 of the 14th July was made, it was the policy of the Hejazi Government to holster up the riyal by generalising its use in other parts of Ibn Baud's dominions, like Nejd and Asir, though it was not hoped to oust the Maria Theresa dollar at a stroke. This policy has been pursued by introducing riyals into Nejd for use in out payments, e.y., it was said that Ibn Sand intended to give his largesse to the tribes this year in Hejazi silver, and a plan was apparently devised for creating in Nejd a network of stalls to retail goods bought or borrowed in the Hejazi towns, the transactions to be effected in riyals only. The latter part of the plan is said to have been defeated by local Nejdi opposition, with the result that the goods had to be stored or sold wholesale. Riyals, though put into circulation in Nejd, are very unpopular there, partly because the merchants complain that they are no use to them in Koweit and Bahrein. Their gold value in Nejd is consequently much lower than in the Hejaz, though information as to the actual rates are conflicting. One informant, the pessimist, says that they went some little time ago as low as 30 to the £, with the result, he adds, that the King in his anger confiscated the goods of twelve Riadh merchants and closed down their shops. (d) The Government have stultified their previous policy of trying to keep riyals at 10 to the £ gold by their own recent attitude. Where possible they pay them out at that rate, but they accept them only at their market value in gold. This is perhaps reasonable in the case of telegraph charges, having regard to the necessity for providing for external settlements. The same rule is, however, applied in other cases, notably that of customs duty. Unfortunately for the financial authorities they have not been able to carry to its logical conclusion their plan of having it both ways, i.e., paying at 10 and collecting at gold rate. In order to clear off debts to certain commercial houses, they have had to agree to take only a portion of the duty on new imports in cash and to allow the remainder to be written off against the debts. Some, at least, of the commercial houses, e.g., Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, have successfully asserted the principle that, for this purpose, the writing off should be on the basis of £ gold to £ gold, instead of at the customs rate for rivals, which fluctuates round the fluctuating market rate. (e) A curious transaction came to my notice accidentally at Port Sudan. I found that the Hejazi postal authorities had cleared off their debt to the Eastern Telegraph Company up to last May and had subsequently made a single payment which was understood to be on account of the June account. This took the form of a cheque in sterling drawn by Credit Lyonnais, Paris, on Credit Lyonnais^ London, on the 26th October last to the order of the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs and endorsed by the latter at Mecca on the 8th December to the Eastern Telegraph Company. I am at a loss to understand how this cheque was bought and can only surmise that it may have something to do with Abdurrahman Qusaibi's activities in Europe. 11. I ought perhaps to apologise for treating so many diverse subjects in a single report. T could not otherwise achieve my object of depicting the general depression and disorganisation which prevail, both for the sake of their intrinsic interest and because of their bearing on the political future. I shall, in later despatches, again deal with the individual subjects separately. In view of the more general character of the present paper, I am sending copies of this to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, His Majesty's High Commissioners for Transjordan and Iraq, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 11, 1932.) (No. 493.) . ' 51r ' ^ Jedda, December 29, 1931. I HAVE attempted in my despatch No. 492 of the 28th December to give a general v ievv of the economic and financial situation in this country. I have now the honour to submit some account of the political situation and the conjectures to which it gives rise in connexion with Ibn Saud's foreign policy. The data ^ are meagre, and I am even more hampered in this case than in my endeavour to sum up the economic situation by the fact that I have had no real contact with the Hejazi Government since my return to Jedda on the 15th December. I should, indeed, reserve this report for a later occasion were it not for its bearing on the possibility of trouble on the northern frontiers of the Hejaz. 2. hen Ibn baud went to Riadh about the beginning of July he was completely fed up with the Hejaz and its problems. He doubtless felt, moreover, that the affairs of Nejd required his personal attention. It was ^ significant that betore going there he made one spectacular gesture designed to vplacate extreme Wahhabi opinion by deferring to the opinion of the ulema of Xejd on the impropriety of celebrating annually his accession to the Hejazi ! nrone. At the same time, he gave another indication of a swing towards the extremists by reviving the machinery for the enforcement of strict religious pi inciples. He did not abandon his schemes for certain improvements on European lines to which fanatics might take exception, like the wireless project. Nevertheless, in the published record of the proceedings of the 'National Conference held in June stress was laid on the principle that economic develop ment should be effected by the instrumentality of Moslems, and the King would not allow the Marconi expert, M. Boucicault, to go to Riadh to erect the wireless station there. 3. W hile the King, on the eve of his departure for Nejd, was thus showing iimself not only a good Moslem, but a good Wahhabi, he had not despaired of European assistance. In his June conversations with me he made a strong appeal 'or a good understanding on all subjects with Great Britain, with special eference to his hope of getting His Majesty's Government to give their patronage .,o himself rather than to the Hashimites and the feasibility of inducing a British &gt;ank to give him financial assistance. He took steps to explore the possibility )f raising the wind in other European quarters also, notably in Holland. He mgaged in dealings with the Bolshevik representative, but there is nothing as ret to show that he was prepared to give much more to the Soviets than the privilege of supplying him with benzine on easy terms, and possibly some 'elaxation of the restrictions on their trade. 4. The situation in the Hejaz, bad in June, has grown much worse since hen. The towns have every reason for discontent, the tribes for disaffection, it is not possible to speak with equal confidence of Nejd, but it is rumoured that here also there is much dissatisfaction. Apart from the usual tales of trouble vith the tribes, there are specific allegations of discontent owing to oppressive axation, non-payment of the wages' of Nejdi soldiers employed in the leighbourhood of the frontier, e.g., at Tabuk, levies in kind on merchants, ttempts to impose the use of the unpopular Hejazi rival, and the reforms ^ nstituted in Hasa by the mission of At-Tawil. ^ 5. Such is the internal situation with which Ibn Sand has to cope, as he ^its tight at Riadh, attempting to deal with the affairs of the Hejaz from a listance with the aid of the advisers summoned in turn to the Nejdi capital; ncertain, perhaps, of his hold on Nejd itself, a country which he can only rule rith a strong hand and largess, and the population of which are so little mpressed by kingly majesty in itself that they are said still to use in speakino- o him the address : ' Ya, Abdul Aziz ! ' The King must realise by now that [354 1 —21there is little chance of money from Europe or of the kind of positive support from Great Britain for which he begged in June—no British bank, no an toice, no backing in his latent struggle with tjie Hashimites. Over all lies the shadow of a pilgrimage much smaller than that of last year, and worse times to come in consequence. ^ t - i 6. It cannot be wondered at that some observers expect tne King to seek salvation in one or both of two things, adventure over the border, or an agree ment with the Soviets. He has engaged in military preparations, as lie is always doing. The tribes, it is said, have been encouraged to hope, or threatened with the necessity of preparing for Jihad, l^or a time it was thought that the objective was the Yemen, but since my return it has been announced that tne King has composed his difference with the Imam in a spirit of piety and kne ot peace in Arabia. The observers whom I have just mentioned are all the moie disposed to think that he is preparing an onslaught on Transjordan, with the object of gratifying his mingled hatred and fear of the Amir Abdullah and gaining access, perhaps, to richer lands than his own. I cannot myseli believe that he would be so foolish as to engage openly in an enterprise which would bring him into direct conflict with His Majesty s (lovernment, but the possioility cannot be dismissed in the case of a man, strong-willed and ambitious, who is already in hard straits and may be desperate in a few months. There is the alternative possibility of the same object being pursued less openly by the promotion of authorised raids. i i • 7. Assuming for the sake of hypothesis that Ibn Saud has some such object in view, three questions, among many others, call for special consideration : What financial resources could he employ for the purposes of his adventure i What is the extent of the reported military preparations? On what outside assistance or sympathy could he rely, from the Soviets or otherwise' 1 will glance at these in order. , . , 8. No one knows what reserve the King has at Riadh, despite the impoverishment of the country and the Hejazi Treasury. It nas been suggested that he has been collecting treasure there, perhaps not gold or not all gold, but in other forms, £.&lt;7., riyals or jewellery. War taxes are said to have been levied on the Hejazi tribes and on the Nejdi townsfolk, 10 riyals a head, it is said, from the tribesmen, 400,000 riyals from those in the area round Taif, and furthei sums from those in the north. According to one account, the latter represented to the Amir Feisal their miserable poverty and offered men with riding camels instead of cash, an offer which the Amir undertook to refer to the King, but which the latter was thought unlikely to accept owing to his lack of confidence in the Hejazi tribesmen. x\nother tale is that the merchants of Anaiza and Buraida are owed £60,000 and have little chance of payment, though eight of them made their way to Mecca to ventilate their grievance, despite the efforts of the Governor of Medina to prevent them from getting further than that place. I cannot pronounce on the probability or otherwise of the King having collected any substantial liquid reserve at Riadh by the alleged exactions and other means, but Mr. Hope Gill, who has followed developments during my absence, especially Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's financial policy, believes in it. 9. As regards the extent of the King's military preparations, I can again rely only on distorted rumours and a few items of fact. He has, of course, his garrisons on the frontier and in certain places not far from it, and he could obtain men from Nejd for a definite enterprise promising warfare and loot. Such troops as there were in Jedda would appear to have been moved to Mecca almost in their entirety. I see in a report from the Political Agent at Bahrein, dated the 23rd November, that an informant newly arrived from the mainland had noted an unusual withdrawal of horsemen towards Nejd, and supposed that they might be intended for an attack on the Yemen. I quote with great reserve a report which has reached me here that the Polish engineer employed in the Government workshop at Mecca has been sent to recruit airmen in Poland. A good deal has been spent during the last year or more on military supplies. It is now said that 24,000 rifles have been repaired in the Mecca workshops, that there were recently 4,000 in hand which the mechanics were being pressed to repair without delay, and that further rifles were expected to be brought from the interior for the same purpose. It is also said that the Soviet representative has been offering rifles, with 1,200 cartridges each, at £2 10.9. per rifle, c.i.f. Whether this be true or not, my informant, the Indian vice-consul, says that a friend of his who wentsome little time ago to the Soviet Legation to buy sterling chanced on one of the A1 Fadhl family and other Nejdis engaged in inspecting various kinds of rifle. 10. The third question need not be dealt with at length. My Russian colleague here has always struck me as more interested in commerce than in politics, and I see nothing in his burst of activity last summer or its results up to date to make me alter that opinion, i can see the Soviets selling rifles or anything else to Ibn Saud on cheap and easy terms, but not at the present time backing him in a foreign adventure otherwise than by perhaps looking on genially at any attempt he might make to fish in troubled waters. 1 discard as fantastic a further suggestion by my principal informant that Russia might, in an endeavour to compass the destruction of the British position in the Middle East, draw Ibn Saud into a general alliance comprising Turkey and Persia. T feel that, if Ibn Saud contemplated further adventure, he would work, as he has always done, on his own expansive lines, a raider in the gvand 'condottiere manner. There may be more to be said for suggestions that he has sought to gain Islamic sympathy through agents in countries like Transjordan, the Yemen and Hadhramaut, perhaps even further afield. 11. This is not intended to be an alarmist despatch. I am only too conscious that the basis of ascertained fact on which I have built is very slender. In my attempt to produce a balanced superstructure I may have given it too formidable an appearance. While writing I have had before me the extremely interesting paper by Major Fowle enclosed in Mr. Walton's letter to M e . Rendel of the 18th November. It will be seen that, though Major Fowle pays me too great a compliment in suggesting that I know more about Ibn Saud than anyone else, my mind has been working on the same general lines as his. There is this difference : that looking at the King in the light of the most recent events, I suspect that the test of his success may come before he disappears from the scene, and I conceive tentatively the possibility of Ibn Saud himself, rather than his successor, being driven to the course suggested in paragraph 10 (&amp;) of Major Fowle s memorandum, that of launching Wahhabi attacks on the surrounding unbelievers. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, His Majesty's High Commissioners for Transjordan and Iraq, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

It would have been very awkward if Ibn Saud had persisted in his refusal to receive me and I fully realise how much I owe to you for uaking him change his attitude. As regards the visit itself, it was certainly extrfcordmarily successful ana he could hardly have been more cordial or more conciliatory. Paud Hamaa seems to have been a snake in the grass, firstly, as regards your note about incursions into Kuwait, since ift his telegram to the King he entirely misrepresented what you said, and secondly, regarding the waergency landing grounds. As regards this the King was definitely helpful and ^usuf Yasm and I studied the map to gether to see what could find, and all that Ymsuf Yasin hinted to me was that they would expect us to foot the bill for any expenditure incurred in levelling the ground, etc.etc. The attitude in Hasa was therefore totally different to Faud ...

I am therefore instructing Dickson to sound the Shaikh and if he reacts favourably to the suggestion i shall ask you to take the matter up officially at your end. If we can keep the officials out of it as much as possible and keep the discussion on business lines, I think we may be able to evolve something. I personally should like to see the commissioners consist of two merchants and one customs official on each side. ality is I do not profess to know.

No. (17)., L etter from H is M ajesty's M inister , J edda &gt; to the F oreign O ffice, No. 36, dated the 21 st J anuary 1932. With reference to my despatch No. 492 of December 28, [Enclo. to S, No. (11)], I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qnra of January 15, published the text of what purports to be a budget for the lunar year begin ning Sha'ban 1,1350, i.e., December 11, 1931. I enclose a translation of the finance law and attached statement, as published. It will be observed that there is a discrepancy of Piastres miri 486,458 between the items and the total shown. 2. The publication of this enactment must be regarded as a distinct advance.. The budget is nevertheless merely an estimate of expenditure under various heads. It is assumed that revenue will be available to meet this expenditure but no attempt is made to estimate the anticipated revenue from various sources. It is not stated whether the budget applies to the Heiaz or to the whole of Ibn Sa'ud's dominions. 3. I had some conversation regarding the budget with Fuad Bey Hamza on January 19, when I was discussing the position in regard to certain British claims. I congratulated him on the step forward made by his Government. I observed that, while the amount ear-marked for the payment of debts did23 not appear to be 25% of the total, as we had been led to expect, it was never theless a substantial sum, viz., £ gold 150,000 on the assumption that jpiastres Miri meant gold piastres at the rate of 110 to the £ gold. He had told me incidentally the previous evening that the Government knew exactly the amount of their liabilities up to the beginning of the financial year. 1 suggested that as they were in this happy positioQ and had now ear-marked a definite sum, which they presumably knew would be available, for paying off the debts, they should be in a position to give concrete indications to their creditors of the instalments which they in tended to pay and tne dates on which payment might be expected. 4. Fuad Bey explained that the amount ear-marked for debts bore in reality a greater proportion to anticipated receipts than would appear. Much of the expenditure shown in 'Piastres Miri' would in fact be incurred in silver. Otherwise, he admitted, the budget would not balance at all. The 16,500,000 piastres miri allocated to debt were, however, gold piastres as I had supposed. I refrained from comment on the singularity of a budget which lumps Piastres Miri whether gold or silver in a single statement, at a time when the Government have practically abandoned the pretence that silver riyals are still at the old legal parity of 10 to the £ gold. 5. Fuad Bey seemed to have no illusions as to the uncertainty of the re venue prospects. I was mainly concerned with the operation of the morato rium implied in the decision to treat all debts up to the beginning of the finan cial year as a floating debt to be paid off by instalments. When I pursued this topic, he told me quite cheerfully that, if things went badly, the Government would he unable to pay and would have to go on from one moratorium to another. He suggested that after all, if money did not come in, it would be owing to causes for which the Government had no responsibility, meaning no doubt that revenue must depend on the volume of the pilgrimage, which would be determined by causes beyond the control of the Government. 6. There is much to be said for Fuad Bey's point of view, despite its apparent levity. I fear, however, that the publication of this so-called budget, although interesting as an indication of the wish of the Government to put their house in order, will have little effect on the practical finance of this country for the coming year. 7.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 251 of the 18th December. I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the Hejazi Government's communique of the 14th December, relative to the negotiations between Hejaz-Nejd and Yemen regarding the Asir frontier, with special reference to the recognition by Ibn Sand of the Imam's right to Mount Arwa. A copy of this communique was forwarded to the Legation on the 14th December, the date of issue, under cover of an unnumbered memorandum of a purely formal nature. 2. Mount Arwa has been mentioned on previous occasions in connexion with the frontier dispute. The name would appear to apply to the position or positions occupied by the Imam last August or early in September, when, according to Fuad Bey, his troops advanced at Jabal Razih. The locality may, presumably, be identified with the Arua, shown in the contoured 1 ; 253.440 map of South-west Arabia, ' Saada' section, as a village lying 12 miles up the valley in which Sada is situated, and definitely on the southerly side of a water shed.' which may well mark a de facto boundary between Yemen and Asir. Razih, which is shown on some maps as a mountain, here appears as a village near the crest of Khaulan-ash-Sham and on what would appear to be the \ emeni side of it. The maps show this massif as standing 50 miles from the sea and due east of Jizan. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty's representative at Rome, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, and the Political Resident at Aden, with copies of mv telegram under reference and an explanation of the reference.

THE representatives of the Government of His Majesty the King met those ■of the Imam Yehya on the 25th Jumada-ath-Thani, 1350 (the 6th November. 1931), at a place called an-Nadhir, near Mount Arw, which was the point in dispute between the two sides. The representatives negotiated regarding the withdrawal of the Yamani troops from Mount Arw, which the latter had occupied as tar as the original [ sic ] frontier line, but they could not arrive at a settlement acceptable to both parties owing to insistence of the \ amani representatives on remaining in the places captured by the Yamani troops at Arw and to the refusal of the representatives of the Government of His Majesty the King to surrender that region of the mountain as it is within the limits of the Idrisi territory. When matters between the representatives had reached a deadlock and each party had referred the matter to its Government, telegraphic messages ere exchanged between His Majesty the King and the Imam Yehya, with the result that the latter requested His Majesty the King to arbitrate in the dispute and to settle it in whatever manner His Majesty thought fit. Wherefore, His Majesty, who wished the dispute to be settled by peaceful means, and bloodshed avoided, and who desired to see co-operation prevailing amongst the Arabs, could not but telegraph to His Highness the Imam his judgment against himself (Ibn Sand), namely, the surrender of Mount Arw to the Yemen in settlement of the [354 p—1]2 difficulty. His Highness the Imam telegraphed in reply, accepting that judgment. Both parties then gave instructions to their representatives to consider other minor matters concerning frontier questions and the determination of the allegiance to one side or the other of tribes residing (on the frontier) between the two countries. The difficulty is, therefore, settled in this way, and strong friendly relations have been established between His Majesty the King and His Highness the Imam Yahia on firm foundations, please God Almighty.

CONFIDENTIAL. J .i, •vn March 24, 1932. S ection 1. Am 3i u ohn Simon.—{Received March 24.) lv [E 1485/165/25] Mr. Hope Gill to Sir (No. 119.) ^ ir ' . Jedda, March 5, 1932. IN his despatch No. 36 of the 21st January, Sir A. Ryan transmitted to you the text of the '' budget ' upon which the finances of this country are supposed now to be based. At the same time he drew attention to the fact that the ' budget contained no detail of estimated revenue; the Hejazi Government simply assuming that sufficient revenue would accrue to meet the estimated expenditure, of which alone certain details were given. 2. To facilitate study of these details, I have prepared a list,^) which I attach, grouping them under six main heads :— (1) Royal allowances. ' (2) Royal Princes, palaces, diwan, and Treasury. (3) Frontier forces and Defence Departments. (4) Communications and transport. (5) Debt instalments. (6) Administrative Departments. 3. It will be noticed that items (1) to (3) are estimated to cost round-figure sums which are multiples of 110. This leads one to suppose that they are calculated on the gold basis of 110 piastres miri equals £1. At this rate they would be equivalent to a total of £660,000. 4. The fifteen subdivisions (a) to {o) of item (6), however, are estimated to the uttermost piastre. In view of the fact that they represent chiefly the salaries and wages of departmental staffs and employees, and in view also of Fuad Hamza s admission reported in paragraph 4 of Sir A. Ryan's despatch that much of the expenditure would, in fact, be incurred in silver^ it is, I think r safe to assume that the whole of item (6) is calculated in silver piastres. The current rate of these is about 190 to the £ gold. At this rate item (6) would represent some £175,000. The total estimated expenditure would thus amount to £835,000 in the current financial year which ends the 30th November next. 5. \ on will observe that none of these items of expenditure bears any relation at all to the percentage allotments which Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Bey Hamza informed me officially and confidentially last November would form the basis of the budgetary reform. Thirty-five per cent, of the revenue was to be devoted to the administration of the country, 25 per cent, to the liquidation of its debt, 25 per cent, to economic development and pilgrimage needs, and 15 per cent, was to be put aside as a reserve fund. This basis has evidently gone by the board. When reporting its adoption, I remarked that it was not clear how the I King would live. It is now quite clear, however, that about half the revenue, or the £410,000 accounted for by expenditure items (1) to (3), will pass to Ibn Sand, or to his comptroller Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. I should not be in the least surprised if item (4) communications and transport, £100,000, also went that way. Items (5) and (6), repayment of debt and payment of administrative costs and salaries, are likely to be the first to suffer from any diminution of revenue below its ' assumed ' total. As I have already reported elsewhere, only 70 per cent, of the first financial month's salaries and none of the second month's have so far been paid. The third month is now drawing to a close and the officials are pessimistic. As for the debts, it is the declared intention of the Government to make no repayment until the end of the financial vear. I make so bold as to prophesy that they will then declare their inability to make any repayment. ( l ) Not printed. [408 aa—1] y6. M hat I have written is no more than a series of assumptions. It is unfortunately impossible to submit to you anything more valid at the present time, it is possible that when the Dutch financial adviser arrives—and I learn Chat he may shortly be expected—something more concrete may materialise. In the mean time this Legation has done its best to collect such local information as may be had, and 1 have the honour to transmit herewith an interesting memorandum by Mr. Furlonge on the results of the Indian vice-consul s conversations with a t 'ind intelligent notable, bheikh Suleiman Gabil, an erstwhile Mayor of Jedda.(') It discloses, with what accuracy I cannot say, a little of the inner history of the budget, and makes an attempt to estimate revenue, which seems to rail short of the estimated expenditure by about 25 per cent, of the latter. I am very much inclined to agree with the ex-mayor's dictum that 'the whole budget is so much eye-wash.' O- J J ai ^ sen(im g copies of this despatch to the recipients of copies of ' oir A. Ryan s despatch under reference. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE GILL. kin (S^^-pfTnTetf'13 equivalent)—the informal committee of notables which the King consults on important decisions. As a result of their deliberations, Suleyman Gabil as spokesman approached the King with the offer to double the Royal allowance (which vras fixed in 192G at about £300,000, according to him) and to adjust the other items of expenditure accordingly. The King agreed and instructed the Committee to consult with Abdullah Suleyman ; which they did at a second meeting held at the latter's house. In the course of this, however, it emerged that the King intended not only to take the doubled allowance but to reserve for himself allt he Kosb^-n receipts, which amount in all to some £7 per pilgrim, or £280,000 last year. S. eing the main item of their anticipated revenue thus abstracted, the Committee decided that the budget scheme was vitiated beyond remedy, and accordingly submitted a loyal address withdrawing the suggestion, affirming that the King was the father of his country, and advising that the status quo ante be maintained. Since that date the Committee Ins had no sort of a voice in the financial arrange ments. 2. The budget ymblished last January is pure Qusuf YA,sin, with a possible flavouring of Abdullah Suleyman. It was arrived at as follows, according to Suleyman Gabil:— {a) The two items of £60,000,. Royal allowance, and £235,000, Military have been c pied from the grants made to the King in 1920, which, as noted above, were nearly £300,000. (Jedda reported in 1921)—Eastern Affairs, P^rt XVIII, pages 100 and 107—that the grant was £2-1,000, but this may have been wrong). (h) The other three round-figure items (Debts, Communication^, and Princes, Palaces, etc. ) were put down at random, in order to look pretty. (c) The remaining items, Administrative expenditure, were copied from the cash-books for same past year, probably 1927, when expenditure was at its highest. This explains their meticulous 1—piastre accuracy. The division of revenue into percentages announced in November has simply been forgotten. 3. The whole production is so much eye wash. Expenditure under (c) above is confined to items of immediate urgency, with a consequent eriormous discrepancy between actual expenditure and the published figures, which represented the amounts expended in an exceptional year when the Govern ment was really endeavouring to run the country properly and was paying its debts. Expenditure under (6), except the Princes-Palace item, is prob bly nil. And {a) f i,e., the King, gets the rest. It appears that the King, A-bdullah Suleiman, and the Treasurer (Abdullah bin Tbrahin al Fadhl) have a secret code between them ; that each day the latter wires to Rih the value of tie day's takings ; that of these takings only enough silver riyals to meet urgent expenses are retained ; and that about once a month the balance of riyals, and all the gold, is remitted to Riadh. It is significant that the ' Treasury ' expenditure is bndgetted with that of the Royal Diwan, Princes, etc., and is separated from that of the Finance Department's. II. Revenue— I have had a further talk with Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah about the possible revenue of the country. It is all specularton, hearsay and guess work. Two items which may be important, postal and telegraph receipts and zikat (religious tithe), cannot be determined in any way : the latter is collected directly by 4 Abdullah Sj ley man and does nor pass through the Finance Depart men. Of the items at which a guess may be made, £ gold. A. Citsfoma receipts are popularly reckoned this year at 2-5 of two years ago, when they were about £1,000,000, i-e. . 400,000 JB. Camel Koshan (on raorchandise) ia about Rs. 4 per camel. It is said that 300 camels {on an average) travel daily from Jedda to Mecca and Medina, with a consequent yield of £66 gold per day, or per year. . 2i,000THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT • — |/V^ vi ' EASTERN (A rabia ). __ ...

WI 1H reference to my telegram Xo. 13 of the 28th January, I have the honour to forward herewith copies of the following correspondence relative to the slave Bakhit: — (1) Translation of Minister for Foreign Affairs note of the 26th December. written after I had telephoned a vigorous message to the Ministry on the 24th December regarding the refusal of the local authorities here to consent to the departure of the two men in question.

(5) Copy of my note of the 21st January, after sending which I had the further conversation with Fuad Bey recorded in the penultimate paragraph of my Savigram No. 1 of the 22nd January. (6) Copy of note which I sent to Mecca by post on the ' 28th January immediately on receipt of your telegram No. 7 of the 27th January. Fuad Bey having left Jedda earlier in the week.

The above is the whole of the correspondence with the Hejazi Government up to this morning. 1 have given in my Savigram No. 1 of the 22iid January a sufficient account of my conversations with Fuad Bey while he was still in Jedda. It is only necessary to add, in view of later developments, that, in my conversation of the 16th January, I told him that I might have chosen the course of taking Bakhit to the quay for embarkation under my own auspices and thereby risking an incident, but that I did not intend to do so as I preferred to seek an amicable settlement, or, failing that, to submit the case to you. 3. I will report separately on the procedure at present followed in connexion with the embarkation of slaves manumitted by the Legation. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

WITH reference to the two slaves, Harun and Bakhit, who took refuge at your Legation a few days ago. I am glad to inform you that His Majesty's Government had issued strict orders prohibiting any purchase of slaves brought from abroad into this country. They accordingly consider that the purchase of Harun. which took place during the year 1349, is contrary to their orders; he therefore, in these circumstances. Lis become free and is in liberty to stay in the Hejaz or to go whether he wishes. With regard to the other. Bakhit, he is one of His Majesty the King's slaves, and this is not disproved by the fact that he was bought through (lit., from the [381 r—1] B2 hand of) Ibn Suliman, for all His Majesty's purchases are made through him I request your Excellency, therefore, to be good enough to hand him over to Sheikh Ali Taha, Assistant Kaimakam of Jedda, so that he may be sent here at an early date. Instructions have been given to him (Ali Taha) accordingly. FEISUL. Enclosure 2 in Xo. 1. Sir .4. Ryan to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca. Your Royal Highness, Jedda, Decemher 31, 1931. (After compliments.) I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Royal Highnesss note of the 26th December and to thank you for the measures taken to overcome the objection at first raised by the local authorities at Jedda to the departure of the Nigerian British subject, Harun. I attach great importance to the case of the other man, Bakhit. I have therefore personally examined him, and L enclose a statement showing his replies to the questions put by me. The local authorities here evidently misunderstood my difficulty in regarding this man as a Royal slave. It was not due to the mere fact of his having passed through the hands of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, but to the fact that he had apparently been for a prolonged period a member of Sheikh Abdullah's household. It seems to me that there may be some mistake as to thg, identity of Bakhit, similar to that which arose last year when certain slaves who had taken refuge in this Legation were erroneously confused with others who had disappeared from the household of His Majesty the King. Even if there be no such confusion in this case, it is of such a nature that I should find it difficult to surrender the man to the local authorities, as your Royal Highness requests me to do, without the sanction of my Government. I am prepared to obtain the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if your Royal Highness wishes me to do so, but, in view of the delicacy of the matter, I would suggest that I should first take an opportunity of discussing it with Sheikh Fuad Hamza, if, as I hope, he is likely to visit Jedda in the near future. With highest respects, ANDREW RYAN. Principal Questions put to Bakhit by Sir A. Ryan on December 29, with his Answers to them, and Supplementary Questions put in the course of the Examination. Question. What is your name ? Answer. Bakhit, son of Muhammad. Q. Where were you born ? A. In the Sudan. I do not know in what place, but someone has told me that I was born in Baghirma. Q. What do you know about your father and mother and about their religion ? A. I was brought here so young that 1 know nothing about my parents. Muhammad was the name of tlie man who brought me here. I know nothing about my father and my mother and I do not know what their religion was. Q. How did you come to the Hejaz? A. I came from Suakin to Jedda in a steamer. Q. Who brought you to the Hejaz ? A. Muhammad brought me. I know nothing else about Muhammad. Muhammad came from a place in the Sudan far from Khartum. Q. At what season did you come ? Was it at pilgrimage time? A. I came fifteen days before the pilgrimage time.Q. What happened to you after you came to Jedda ? A. I was playing with some other boys near Kandara. Some Bedouin came and took me. They carried me off to Ganuna. They took me all the way by camel. They sold me to somebody in Ganuna. The name of the man who bought me was Ahmed-bin-Ghasin. I remained with him about three years and was all the time at Ganuna. After three years Ahmed brought me to Mecca and sold me to Shakir-abu-Jemal. I remained with Shakir in Mecca about five years. After that Shakir sent me to Medina with his family at the beginning of the war of Ibn Saud. Shakir himself stayed in Mecca. I stayed about one year in Medina with the family of Shakir. Then the Amir Muhammad, son of Ibn Saud, entered Medina and he took me. I remained with him three days. Then he sent me as a gift to Ebn Musaad at Hail. I remained with Ibn Musaad at Hail about six years. Ibn Musaad is the nephew of Ibn Jiluwi, who is in Hasa. Ibn Musaad is the Amir of Hail. After those six years Ibn Musaad sent me to Abdullah-bin-Suleiman at Mecca. I remained with Abdullah-bin-Suleiman about one year and a half. Then I came to Jedda, having escaped from my master. My master was not in Mecca when I ran away, but his brother Hamad-as-Suleiman was there. Q. In whose house were you just before you came to the Legation A. I was in the house of Hamid-as-Suleiman. It is one house with the house of Abdullah. My master was Abdullah. Q. How long had you been in that house ? A. I was in that house one year and a half'. Q. Did your master buy you from anyone else, or were you given to him as a present ? A. I was given to Abdullah as a present. Q. Why did you leave your master? A. I left my master because if I asked him for anything he refused it. Q. They say that you are a slave of the King. What do you say? A. I was not sent to the King. I do not know the King and he does not know me. I was never in the King's house. I was never in the house of any of the King's sons or brothers after the Amir Muhammad sent me to Hail. Q. But they say that Abdullah-bin-Suleiman brings many slaves for the King, and that many of the slaves in the house of Abdullah-bin-Suleiman belong to the King. What do you say ? A. When Abdullah-bin-Suleiman brings slaves for the King he sends them immediately to the King and they are kept in the King's house. The slaves that are kept in the house of Abdullah-as-Suleiman belong to Abdullah-as-Suleiman. Q. Do you know your age when you came from Suakin to Jedda? A. I do not know at all my age. Some people tell me that my age was about 6 years. Q. Were you always a Moslem as long as you remember ? A. I know myself as a Moslem, and I always pray. Q. But sometimes children who are born in Africa are not Moslems and are made Moslems. If you were circumcised when you were a boy you would remember it, because it hurts. A. It is true. When I came I was young and I did not know anything about myself. I do not remember anything about it or about being circumcised. When I came to Jedda with Muhammad just before the pilgrimage time we went to Mecca, and we came back to Jedda for about ten days, and then the Bedouin stole we while I was playing.

I have just received an urgent telegram from His Majesty the King stating that the slaves placed in Abdullah-as-Suleiman's possession do not belong to him but are the property of His Majesty; and that the slave Bakhit, the subject of the present enquiry, was actually sent by Ibn Musaid as a present to His Majesty 1 u King, who 01 deied that he should lie left with Sheikh Abdullah-as-Suleiman, he being, as you are aware, the person who takes charge of anv unwanted slave or other property of His Majesty for future disposal. Jn view of this fact and in accordance with the agreement concluded between His Majesty and Sir Gilbert Clayton during the negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of Jedda in the year 1927, and in which it is laid down that no slave belonging to His Majesty and seeking refuge in the premises of the British agencv, viil be accepted, 1 trust that your Excellency will see no objection to returning the slave Bakhit to the local Government in order that he may be sent to us. I earnestly hope that you will appreciate this situation and will take steps to remedy it. ^ ith highest respects, FETSUL. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Fuad Bey to Sir A. Ryan. (1 ran slat ion.)

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Royal Highness's note of the 10th Ramadhan (the 18th January) relative to the slave Bakhit, who took refuge in this Legation some weeks ago. Before this case arose, I had no knowledge of the special position of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman as regards the buying of slaves for His Majesty the King and their custody, a matter which your Royal Highness and the Under-Secretary of State have been good enough to explain to me. I need hardly say that I accept without hesitation the King's assurance that the slave Bakhit, though resident in the household of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman since he was sent from Hail, belongs to His Majesty. There remains the more difficult question as to how the case of Bakhit is affected by the understanding reached between His Majesty and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton when the latter was negotiating the questions of the slave trade and manumission in connexion with the Treaty of Jedda. His Majesty the King will readily understand that I must consult my Government as to the nature and scope of any arrangements then made, but not embodied in the texts of the treaty and the annexed letters. In view of the wish expressed by His Excellency Fuad Bay that this question should be dealt with in an unofficial manner, I am in communication with him on the subject with a view to elucidating the questions to be submitted to my Government. With highest respects, ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca. Your Royal Highness, Jedda, January 28, 1932. (After Compliments.) WITH reference to my note of the 21st January, I have the honour to state that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, after careful considera tion of the case of the man Bakhit, who fled to this Legation from the house of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, find themselves unable to accept the contention of the Hejazi Government that the man in question should not have been given asylum at the Legation and manumitted in the usual way. My Government, who attach the greatest importance to this case, have instructed me to take the necessary steps to embark the man in question in His Majesty's sloop 'Penzance, now lying in Jedda Harbour. 1 am taking the necessary measures to carry out these express instructions without delay and would ask that the local authorities of Jedda may be informed accordingly. The decision which my Government have intimated to me is categorical regarding the case of Bakhit. I am still in communication with them regarding the wider issues raised in the personal letter which his Excellency the Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addressed to me on the 11th Ramadhan (the 19th January) and my discussion with Fuad Bey on the 21st January. With highest respects, ANDREW RYAN. [381 r—1] b 3() Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir A. Ryan. (Telegraphic.) Mecca, January 28, 1932. WITH reference to your note dated 28th January, I must express my deep regret at its contents concerning decision given (and) that I should be compelled, in accordance with the right and agreement made between us, to refuse it and to consider it contradictory to the mutual understanding to which my Government strictly adhere. Therefore the Government cannot agree to allow the local authorities at Jedda to give permission for the departure of the slave in question. With regard to the other points of your note, 1 will reply at a later opportunity. Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca. (Teleoraphic.)

If local authorities raise any difficulty all responsibility will lie with your Government. E 795/314/25] No. 2. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received February IT.') (No. 62.) gi r Jedda, February 1, 1932. WITH reference to my telegram No. 15 of the 29th January relative to the disposal of the ex-slave Bakhit, 1 have the honour to forward the following three documents which complete up to date the correspondence enclosed in my despatch No. 58 sent earlier that day :— Translation of a telegram received from the Minister for foreign Aitairs at 1T5 p.m . on the 29th January; Copy of paper presented to the port authorities at the moment of Bakhit s embarkation at 41 5 p.m . that day. Copy of telegram sent to Minister for Foreign Affairs in the evening of the same day. 2. In view of the possible repercussions of this affair it may be well to record what actually happened. When I sent my note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 28th January my intention was to make no attempt to embark Bakhit until the 30th January, so that the authorities in Mecca should have had time to communicate by wireless with Ibn Sand. As they replied the same evening, I decided early on the 30th January to advance the plan alreadv made, which was to send Bakhit to the usual embarkation place in charge of Mr. Hope Gill and any other necessary members of the staff and to embark him in the Legation launch for conveyance to His Majesty's sloop ' Penzance,' unless the police, &amp;c., offered such opposition as to amount to forcible resistance. If such resistance were offered Mr. Hope Gill was to do everything possible to prevent the man s falling* into the hands of the local authorities and to brino- him back to the Legation pending consideration of the next move. I saw nothing in the enclosed telegram from Mecca to necessitate any alteration in the arrangements. I enclose a memorandum by Mr. Hope Gill showing how T they were finally carried out. 3. I thank you, sir, on Mr. Hope Gill's behalf and my own for your telegram No. 10 of the 30th January congratulating us on the successful embarkation of the ex-slave. I may say that it was necessary to consider every possible contingency and that certain risks had to be taken. Mr. Hope Gill and the other members of my staff concerned deserve great credit for their handling of thesituation at the port, which was such that the fullest advantage was taken of the amazing ineptitude of the Hejazi authorities both high and low. I under stand from a trustworthy source that the Governor of Jedda refused to have anything to do with the matter as being one within the province of the Ministry for Foreign A flairs. It would appear that Fuad Bey Hamza then gave direct instructions to the police. They were that if I myself took Bakhit down they were to remonstrate but not to resist ; whereas if he were accompanied by Captain Seager, who normally deals with slaves, they were to prevent the embarkation by every means. Mr. Hope Crill s report shows that they were taken by surprise perhaps owing to the effect of the Ramadhan fast, and that Bakhit was on board before they collected themselves enough to confront a situation not foreseen by tuad Bey, namely, the presence not of myself but of several members of my staff headed by Mr. Hope (xill, who is known to act as His Majesty s representative lor long periods. The head of the police party was thrown into prison in due course. 1 have even been sounded as to whether I might not get him out. 4. As J pointed out in my telegram No. 15 of the 29th January, the matter is not ended by the embarkation of the individual concerned. Ibn Saud has been dealt with, for very good reasons, like any little Trucial Sheikh. Fuad Bey, who feels that the maintenance of the right of manumission is the one breach in the independence consecrated by the Treaty of Jedda, will encourage the King to believe that I am primarily responsible for the affront. Your action has followed so logically on the line which I myself had taken in discussing the Bakhit case that people of their mental outlook will assume that I inspired your decision. My position with both the King and Fuad Bey may become more than difficult, especially as Ibn Saud has been none too pleased with me since August 1930. o. Jt is also probable that the question of manumission generally will come tu a head. The Tlejazi authorities have been more and more obstructive over ordinary slaves. i have reason to believe that they have now issued most stringent instructions with a view to preventing slaves from gaining access to the Legation. An opportunity of testing the Hejazi attitude will present itself in the immediate future. I have at present in the Legation two ordinary slaves. I obtained the consent of the local authorities to the embarkation of one of them on the 23rd January, after they had made all sorts of difficulties. The man got on board the Khedivial steamer just before it sailed for Port Sudan, but had to be refused a passage as he was found by the ship's doctor to have an infectious disease diagnosed on board as small-pox, on shore as chicken-pox. In the other case the usual period of notice to the local authorities has not yet expired and I do not wish to give the authorities any excuse for criticism. I have therefore arranged to keep those two cases separate from that of Bakhit and to endeavour to embark the men in the ordinary way on the 6th February, when the one will have recovered and time will have been allowed for the completion of the formalities in the second case. Mr. Hope Gill will keep you informed of develop ments during my absence from Jedda. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 2. Minister for Foreicjn Affairs to Sir A . Ryan. {Translation.) (lelegraphic.) Mecca, January 29, 1932. IN reply to your telegram of to-day's date, my Government do not agree, and never will agree, to the departure of the slave Bakhit, which is contrary to the agreement which exists between our two Governments: They, therefore, cannot oppose the action of the local authorities in preventing the embarkation of a person in a manner contrary to the laws which are observed and are in force. I hey cannot accept your statement that the responsibility for the opposition lies on them. On the contrary, we assure you {sic, ? tJiey assure you) that their insistence on their rights and the right of their authorities in their territories will not result in any responsibility (falling) on them. The responsibility, rather, falls on those who wish to violate the great right. And they, while insisting on this right of theirs and on their refusal to accept responsibility, notify you thatthey consider your Excellency responsible personally for precipitating and causing an incident which results in a violation of their authority, and they consider you responsible for the future results of this hasty action. But if you wish to bring the ' Penzance ' into the matter, their regret for this second aggression will be much greater than for the first, and they hope that you will not make the situation more critical by bringing the ' Penzance ' into it. However, they reserve to themselves their full rights in protesting and requesting suitable reparation. Enclosure 2 in No. 2. Certificate. BAKHIT- bin -MUHAMMED has been manumitted by the British Legation, and notice of his intended repatriation was given to the local authorities in Jedda on the 21st December. He is being sent on board His Britannic Majesty's ship ' Penzance ' to-day in accoi dance with instructions received from His Majesty's Government. A communication in this sense was addressed to the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs by His Majesty's Minister on the 28th January, and was confirmed by a telegram to His Royal Highness the Minister this morning. In these circumstances, I have instructed Mr. Hope Gill to take the necessary steps for the embarkation of Bakhit in the launch of the Legation, to be conveyed to H.M.S. £l Penzance.'

I HAVE received your Royal Highness s telegram of to-day. Greatly as I regret any cause of dissension, I was compelled to submit case of Bakhit to my Government after failure of my efforts to settle it amicably. They do not admit that this particular case is covered by any existing agreement. I carried out their decision this afternoon, and am responsible to them for my action. Enclosure 4 in No. 2. Memorandum by Mr. Hofe Gill. Minister, YOUR order of yesterday, that the Royal slave, Bakhit, was to be taken off to H.M.S. 'Penzance' openly, without subterfuge and after due warning to the Hejazi Government, was duly carried out by the Legation staff at 4T5 p.m. A preliminary reconnaissance of the port by the head cavass did not reveal any extraordinary police precautions, although it was found afterwards that a new Nejdi police officer and half a dozen Nejdi soldiers had been posted at the quay. The slave was driven in the Legation car to the main entrance to the quay, and followed me through the port hangar down to the quayside. Captain Seager meanwhile engaged the attention of the passport control officials and presented your embarkation paper. Mr. Wikeley brought up the rear in case an attempt were made to take the man from behind. Two armed police under the police officer were posted as usual at the quay side. They made no attempt whatever to interfere. I ordered the slave into the Legation launch and followed him; after a short conversation with Mr. Wikeley, I gave the word to start. When the launch was already about 10 yards away and gathering speed, two soldiers appeared, and with the police made a futile rushV to the end of the quay, shouting to the launch to stop. I slackened speed, and asked them somewhat angrily if they did not know who 1 was. This silenced them, and while they were scratching their heads the launch proceeded without any further attempt being made to interfere, and the slave was put on board H.M.S. ' Penzance.' Mr. Wikeley remained on the quay, and explained that it was indeed the slave, Bakhit, who had been taken off. Captain Seager had some difficulty in persuading anyone to accept your embarkation certificate. The passport officer eventually took it, but handed it at once to the police officer, who hurried off to report by telephone to the Governor. Mr. Wikeley and Captain Seager returned to report to you. On my return to the quay I brought back the head cavass and the launch boy to the Legation, but no attempt has been made to interfere with them. The staff did their work well, and without hurry, fuss or opposition. C. G. H. G. January 30, 1932. nthis document is the property of his britannic majesty 'S ooyernmeni EASTERN (A rabia).

Ryan's despatch No. 62 of the 1st February, in which he reported the circumstances surrounding the embarkation of the slave Bakhit in His Majesty's sloop ' Penzance,' I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a memorandum which explains in detail the procedure of manumission as at present observed. 2. This memorandum shows the extent to which the local authorities can go if disposed to prevent the embarkation of a slave manumitted by the Legation. No person may leave Jedda by sea without permission from the Governor. The ordinary traveller must obtain an exit visa. In the case of a slave or a destitute who is being repatriated the Governor's signature is required before the port officials will allow him to embark. It was owing to the refusal of the Hejazi Government to allow the Governor to authorise Bakhit's departure that the certificate enclosed in the despatch under reference was handed to the passport control at the quay. T have. &amp;c. C. G. HOPE GILL. / /A i ; Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Manumission of Slaves who take Refuge in the Legation. I'rocedure. A SLA\ E arrives at the Legation, usually in the very early morning and by stealth, having succeeded in entering the town by the guarded Mecca gate disguised as one of the West African day labourers who live outside the walls. Occasionally a slave arrives in broad daylight and actively pursued, having run away from a local household. Pursuit generally stops at the Legation gate, however, although Bedouin have been known to carry it into the Legation itself, and have had to be turned out. Now and again a slave is sent to the Legation bv another mission, for none of these themselves manumit slaves. 2. The slave s arrival is reported by the docr-keeper to the pro-consul, who interrogates him (or her) and has him thoroughly searched for anything in the way of money or valuables or arms. If of such kind or quantity as a slave would not normally possess, but might be suspected to have stolen, thev are taken from him and kept pending enquiry. 3. The slave is then examined by the Legation interpreter in the presence of a cavass and his full story is extracted, pieced together and written down. He is then passed for cross-examination, with his history, and in charge of the same cavass, to the Indian vice-consul, who has long experience of the country and slavery conditions. 4. The slave is then returned, with the report of his examination and cross- examination, to the pro-consul, who, if he satisfies himself that the case is hond-fide, gives the slave a room on the ground floor and places him in charge of the door-keeper, allotting the equivalent of is. a day from the Legation charity fund for his food, which is purchased for him by the door-keeper He is not required to do any work of any kind. 5. The slave's history sheet is meanwhile passed to the Chancery for filing and submission to the Head of Chancery, whose duty it is to assure himself that the case is a straightforward one requiring manumission. If satisfied, he passes [381 r—2] y/ v 'the lile to the pro-consul with instructions (a) to inform the local authorities unofficially that the slave has taken refuge, giving them such details as may enable them to trace his master and satisfy themselves that he is not a fugitive liom justice; and {h) to draw up a manumission questionnaire (specimen attached(')). This form is submitted to the Minister for approval and eventual signature (see 11). 6. Any case which presents unusual features is reserved for the Minister's decision belore further steps are taken vis-a-vis the local authorities. A slaves master seldom makes any attempt to retrieve him. In a few cases, however, more especially in regard 'to female slaves, the master sends a friend to the Legation, very occasionally coming himself, to try to persuade the slave to return. He lias, however, to speak to him (or her) in the presence of the pio-consul. It is sometimes then found possible to arrange for voluntary manu mission by the master, which takes the form of a declaration of grant of freedom, made before the Sharia Court of Jedda, sealed by the court and presented by the mastei to the Legation for safe keeping. Che ex-slave thereupon leaves with his (or her) former master. K In the majority of cases, however, the master makes no move and the slave remains in the Legation. Once in a way a slave walks away and does not i eturn, but if, as in the normal run of cases, he is ready to accept manumission m the Legation and repatriation to Africa, seven days are allowed to pass before the local authorities are officially approached by the Legation. They are then asked foi the necessary permission, without which no one, bond or free, foreigner 01 native, is allowed to leave the country. This period has by usage become a minimum time, in which the local authorities are expected to be able to satisfy themselves that the slave is not a thief or otherwise criminally charged by his master. It is normally exceeded only by the time necessary to await the arrival of a suitable ship on which to embark the slave. 9. Shortly before the date of sailing, and provided the authorities have had seven days' notice of the slave's arrival at the Legation, a written request is addressed to the Governor ' to grant the usual facilities in respect of so-and-so, who is being sent by the Legation to . . . .' If higher authority in Mecca has intervened, or if a claim lies against the slave, the ' facilities ' are refused until the matter is settled with the Ministry for foreign Affairs. In such cases which have not hitherto been many, the slave is kept until the next sailing. Ordinarily, however, the Governor endorses the request with his signature, an act which has two functions: it authorises the slave's departure, and is thus equivalent to the permissive exit visa which all departing travellers must obtain; and it grants exemption from the usual fees, from which destitutes and slaves, who are being lepatnated by the Legation, have hitherto by custom been exempted. 10. Tims endorsed, the request passes to the finance Department who retain it and issue two written orders, one to the Passport Office, the other to the (q^uai an tine Department, instructing them to allow so-and-so to pass freelv and without payment of the outgoing dues. Armed with these orders, a cavass accompanies the slave to the quay, embarks him in the Legation launch and places him on board ship. 11. The Legation's act of manumission itself is comprised in the signing- by the Minister of the manumission questionnaire. This has hitherto and bv usage (specimen AC)) merely implied manumission. It now (specimen Bf 1 )') specifically declares it. This form is sent under cover of a despatch to the authority who is to receive the ex-slave on arrival, and goes bv the same ship. A copy is retained in the Legation file of manumissions. Statistics of the slaves manumitted in 1930 and 1931 are attached (C( 1 )). 12. The majority of slaves are sent to Suakin, where the Sudan Govern ment maintain a special slave s cubicle for their reception After the necessary period of quarantine, the Commissioner at Port Sudan, who receives and files the Legation manumission form, interests himself in finding suitable employment for the liberated man. Very few manumitted slaves are 'known to return to Arabia. Jedda, February 3, 1932.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 119 of the 5th March on the subject of the budget, I have the honour to report that I learn from a confidential and fairly trustworthy source that the Jedda Customs receipts for the first quarter of the current financial year amounted to some £27,500 gold. The customs houses at Yanbu and other ports may have taken half as much again, bringing the total to about £40,000, but I have no figures to go on. Revenue from customs would thus fall well below the rough estimate of £100,000 as average customs revenue per quarter, which I submitted in my previous despatch. The detailed figures of the quarter's receipts are attached. 2. I also learn, from the quarantine authorities, that the number of pilgrims who arrived during the quarter was about 9.000. These will have yielded, at the generally computed figure of £7 per head for Koshan, a total of £63,000 gold, plus £9,000 in quarantine dues. 3. Out of this minimum total revenue of about £110,000 for the quarter, the only known outgoings have been some £29.000 in respect of the first and third months' salaries, which have now been paid. The pay of all Government servants is thus only one month in arrear on the completion of the first quarter of the new budgetary year. 4. It is, I think, probable that most of the remaining £80,000 of revenue has gone to Riadh. I am sending copies of this despatch to the recipients of my despatch under reference. I have, &amp;c. C. G.

M\&gt; BuoHiRE, RE^D RNC March 8, 1932. /I Out V OONfiOENT^L REQ0R03. S ection 1. [E 1191/1191/25 Mr. Hove Gill to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 8.) (No. 80.) HIS Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him a report on the heads of foreign missions at this post for the year 1931. Jedda, February 10, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. Confidential Report on Heads of Foreign Missions at Jedda. (Passages marked with an asterisk (*) are reproduced from last year s .report.) Egypt. HASSAN ACHMOUNI BEY was superseded in March 1931 by Hafez Amer Hey, a gentleman with no previous diplomatic or consular experience, but said to be a protege of Emin \ehia Pasha, brother of the Egyptian Minister for ioreign Affairs. He was originally an advocate at Tantah, his home town, and later held various minor judicial posts in Egypt. He speaks English imperfectly and i rench very sketchily. He is by way of being very friendly with the British Legation and pays extravagant compliments, especially to my' wife. He affects an air of frankness, which is for the most part illusory, but which gives him an excuse for his own great inquisitiveness. On the whole, he is an agreeable colleague, but excessively soapy in his manner. He is an ardent and somewhat apostolic Moslem, rigid in abstention from alcohol and other observances. Before he had been long here, he conceived a very poor opinion of the Wahhabi regime. Little is known of his diplomatic activities except that he pursues in an unfavourable atmosphere the long-outstanding conversations with a view to a better understanding between Egypt and Hejaz-Nejd. It is too soon to jud^e of his capacity. Hafez Amer Bey has a family, but they live in Egypt. France. *M. Roger Maigret, who occupies the peculiar position of being Charge d'Affaires at the head of what is still a consulate, is a man of perhaps 60. He has had a long career in the French Near East service, and was employed for some twenty years in Morocco, including Tangier, where, I believe, he was employed up to 1921. He was subsequently employed in Iraq, whence he came to his post here. I have heard it vaguely suggested that he was not well regarded in Morocco, but cannot vouch for this. He is intelligent and witty, and has a considerable knowledge of Arab countries. In his lighter moments he claims also to know a great deal of the Parisian underworld, having cultivated apaches in his conscript days. As we have both been in Morocco, though at different periods, I have many interests and acquaintances in common with him. 1 find him, however, rather too ' smarmy ' on the personal side and rather too reticent about the affairs which now interest us both officially. He has little social value of a general kind, for, though he has a passion for Arabian travel, he sticks very tight in his house when in Jedda. I have not heard him speak English, but he appears to have considerable book knowledge of this language, and has alreadv completed a French translation of Mr. Philby's recent work on ' Arabia.' *He is married, but appears to be permanently separated from his Spanish or half-Spanish wife. She has never come to Jedda. A venerable mother has recently come to live with M. Maigret instead. [408 h—1]Since the above was written M. Maigret has become even more of a recluse. He is seldom seen away from his house. His emoluments are said to be quite considerable, but he does practically no entertaining, except for a small weekly card party. Germany. M. Heinrich de Haas arrived in Jedda in the autumn of 1930 to spy out the land for trade. Having settled down to do business in partnership with a Moslem Tripolitan exile, and as a result of the ratification of the treaty between Germany and the Hejaz-Nejd, he was appointed consul for the Hejaz, obtained an exequatur, and entered upon his functions in March 1931. He continues, nevertheless, to trade. He is about 38 years of age and the son of the late Dr. Walter de Haas, who spent most of his life in Australia, where both were interned during the war, and who was subsequently employed in the German Foreign Office as head of the so-called 'Anglo-Saxon' Department. Shortly before the death of his father last November, M. de Haas left Jedda, and he may not return. His post is meanwhile unofficially occupied by a resident German merchant. A pleasant colleague with an excellent knowledge of English and good French. He is unmarried. Italy. ^ The Italian representative, M. Sollazzo, calls himself consul, although Italy has not yet established normal relations with Ibn Sand. He is a youngish man of about 35, but not aggressively Fascist. He speaks French reasonably well. He is a man of good average intelligence and definite views. He finds himself, 1 think, rather overshadowed by the Italian administrators in Eritrea. He does not seem to care much for society; but I find him an agreeable and useful colleague, very ready to exchange information on matters of interest. *M. Sollazzo married not long ago an attractive and pleasant but not very interesting Italian wife. She shares all his vicissitudes, .but they both dislike Jedda. J The foregoing paragraph is less than just to Mme. Sollazzo, who has come out a great deal and now shows herself lively and intelligent. • Netherlands. M. van der Meulen was succeeded in July 1931 by M. C. Adriaanse, who, in accordance with standing Dutch arrangements, came here earlier in the year to prepare to take over the post of Charge d'Affaires. He is large, loose-limbed and a good fellow. He does not speak English as well as his predecessor, but has quite an adequate command of it. He has made a serious study of classical Arabic at the feet of Professor Snouck Hurgronje, and acted as general secretary to the Orientalists' Conference at Leiden last summer. He can get on in the spoken language. As an official, he gives the impression of being steady rather than specially able. He maintains the traditional good relations with this Legation and is genuinely friendly with all of us. M. Adriaanse has a wife and family in Holland. Persia. *M. Habibulla (or Habibulla Khan) Hoveida bore in the days of Persian titles that of Ain-ul-Mulk. He was ' diplomatic representative ' when I arrived and is now Charge d'Altaires. He is a Persian Moslem, but his special habitat appears to be in Syria. He is an elderly man. He was recommended to my favourable attention by Sir R. Clive, but 1 fear that I find him unattractive, in spite of his great desire to please and his ability to speak English passably, I have heard him accused of making so much per head outof his pilgrims, but I have no reason to believe a charge so easy to invent in connexion with the representative of a country like Persia in a country like this. He left Jedda some six months ago. Shortly afterwards, the junior whom he left in charge went away also, telling ns that his wife was ill and asking us to forward correspondence to his chief at Beirut. Little seems to have been heard of either since then, and thePersian Legation is not effectively occupied. I much doubt whether M. Hoveida will return. His health suffered here, and I rather think that he covets the post of Persian representative at Cairo. M. Hoveida did return in April 1931, but stayed only until June, and did not come hack again until the end of December. On this occasion, however, he left a subordinate, who is also his sister's husband, in charge. During his stay he gave one spectacular diplomatic dinner, after which he photographed the company by incandescent lamplight. The result, though odd, was more successful than might have been expected. I was, perhaps, too hard on him last year. At any rate, his friendship towards us appears to be genuine. Soviet Russia. *M. Nezir (sometimes called Nezir Bey) Touracoulov, the only Minister besides myself, presented letters before me, and is therefore doyen of the Diplomatic Body. He comes from Turkestan, and is a round-headed young man with distinctly Tartar features. He seems fairly intelligent, and has learnt enough T rench and Arabic since he came here a couple of years ago to carry on conversation in those languages. He usually talks Turkish, which he knows better, on the comparatively rare occasions when we meet. He has a sound, simple sense of humour and is an agreeable companion, but he goes little into European society. I have never attempted to talk politics to him. On the one occasion on which I had occasion to seek information from him on a non- political matter connected with public health he was very helpful. He presents no appearance of wishing to make a splash. He strikes me as a nice, straight- torward person, rather more interested in commercial and economic subjects than in others, and as being a genuine Moslem. If I am wrong and he is deep, then he must be very deep indeed. M. Touracoulov is married to a Russian lady from Samara. She is a professional doctor or nurse, and left Jedda before I arrived in May to take charge of some sort of institution in Moscow. She has not returned. I continue to like M. Touracoulov, but doubt whether he is as simple or as good a Moslem as I supposed. He had a burst of diplomatic activity in the summer, when he went into the business of selling benzine to the Hejazi' Govern ment, and perhaps attempted even greater things, with a view to bringing his country into closer relations with the Hejaz. He went on long leave in October. It is doubtful whether he will return. Turkey. Seni Bey left in July to take up an important post in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Ankara. He was succeeded in July by Ahmed Lutfullah Bey. The latter, had a small post at the Sublime Porte in the old days in Turkey and is a favourable specimen of the type of official produced there. Before his appointment in Jedda he had been employed at Ankara and in London, and appears to have been favourably regarded by British colleagues. He speaks French well and has some knowledge of English. He has varied interests. He claims to be an authority on protocol (he has published a work in two volumes on the subject), and he dabbles in the arts. He is amiable and talkative. In our short acquaintance I have been unable to form any opinion of his capacity, but should imagine that he is keener on his side-lines than on playing an active diplomatic role. He is personally intimate w T ith the non-Moslem Russian who acts as Soviet representative in the Minister's absence. Lutfullah Bey is unmarried.
