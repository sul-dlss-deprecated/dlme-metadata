I have not received any complaints from the Navy, and, unless I do so, do not propose to pass on your letter to any other authority, but will mention the visit briefly in my monthly letter. 2. There is one small point to which I would call attention, that in the old days v the Commander-in-Chief, x^ast Indies was an Excellency ana used to receive a salute of 17 guns in Indian waters including the Gulf. Now that he no longer belongs to the Indian hierarchy and that the Gulf waters are no longer regarded as Indian he is no£an 'Excellency' 1 and entitled only to a Vice- iidmiral* s salute of 15 guns.

Ity dear Sir Rupert, I ancloaa a copy of tha programme observed at ruacr.t on th* occasion of the visit of h.M.S. %uritiua from the 'jrd to the 5th Febuary. The progranae itself went off very well, though ot tinea the weather was threatening and we had aone rain. I was informed by Koods-Ballerd to whom I sent suggestions for the visit in the shape of e draft prcgramne, that the Sultan had approved all cay suggestions, and so got the progranae finalised and confirtaed by the C orcnander-in-Chief, r On the evening of the 1st Febuary Woods-Ballard told ae that the Sultan was leaving for Sur hy launch on the afternoon of the 3rd Febuary. I pointed out at once that it struck me as very ungracious that after the whole progranm had been arranged, and the ship had come all this way to visit Muscat, the Sultan should not even wait fur the Coeraander-in-Chief*e lunch on the 4 th I ebT aryjwhich he had virtually acc pted. I offered to cancel nine on the 3rd, ar*f have the Coafnander-in-Chief'a then. However -&gt;ods-Ballard at ray request then telephoned the Sultan, and h* decided to stay over till the evening of the 4 th. Next day on getting the approval of the Cosriander-in-Chief to the progranme, I issued ay own luncheon invitations, thereupon I got a letter from the Sultan to say that he could not cone, and his Minister for Foreign Affaire would explain. This Woods-Ballard did, to the effect that the Sultan objected to coaing because there was no precedent. I certainly could find no actual precedent, but of course he comes when the Polit cal Resident visits. He also case when I asked hia before when the Senior Naval Officer visited Just after ny arrival here. However I did not see any point in taking up the question of precedent, and merely said that it was not an official function but a private party, and that if the Sultan did not wish to come, there was no more to be said. I cannot help feeling that Woods-Ballard forgot tc show the Sultan my draft programme in the first place, so I wrote a letter to the Sultan, simply thanking him for his letter and apologising for having bothered him with my invitation, and saying that I would never have written it, had I not been given to understand that he had had the suggested programme laid before him and approved it and trusted the rest of the programme was satisfactory. I enclose copies of our letters for your information. I met the Sultan at the call and at the Cooiaander-5n-Chief *s lunch, and he seemed quite as friendly as ever, but made no mention of the subject, so I did not raise it either. I think, as over sending the launch for your departure, someone had tripped up, b t they^e not telling. I see Saiyid Thuwainy is working as a sort of private secretary in the Palace, and it is possible he is making mistakes, or forgetting to put things up that I?nods-Ballard refers through him. Only yesterday when I sent some sailors to see the Fort the Police said t ey had had no Instructions, though Salyid Thuwainy had assured us that they had. Anyhow I am sure it is not the Sultan, who never forgets aiything, and aeeraa invariably co-operative and friendly whenever we meet. The only real disappointment of the v&amp;slt was when the Marines volunteered to play Retreat on the hockey field after the match. Though Salyld Tariq and Woods-Ballard had welcomed it provisionally, and it was all laid on, when they His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay. K.C.I.E.,C.S.I. Political Resident.
