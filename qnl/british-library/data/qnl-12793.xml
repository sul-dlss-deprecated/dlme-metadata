MacLeod writes that his predecessor, the Acting Resident, procured a firman from the Prince Regent of Fars, forbidding the extraction of this duty from British subjects, but no counter authority to the firman was received. MacLeod writes that he will protest against the extraction of the duty until he has received instructions either from the Governor in Council or from Willock. Therefore, he asks Willock to make a representation to the Government of Persia to his Royal Highness the Prince Hoosein Ali Meerza [Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mīrzā] with the view of preventing unauthorised extractions of duty by the Shaikh of Bushire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000017#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
