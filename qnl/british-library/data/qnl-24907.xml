I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th ultimo, on the subject of the repayment by the Persian Government, under the amortisation scheme of 1910, of the consolidated Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903-4, now amounting to 314,281L 16s. 4d. 1 am to observe that Sir E. Grey has been informed by the Marquess of Crewe that the amortisation table, of which a copy was enclosed in the letter from this Department of the 21st December, 1910, was calculated on the basis that the payments should be made annually. From your letter of the 4th ultimo, however, it is evident that both parties to the agreement of 1910 regard as operative, payment by monthly instalments an arrangement provided for under articles 4 and 9 of that instrument. Sir E. Grey and Lord Crewe consider this arrangement unobjectionable, but I am to point out that its adoption necessitates a slight revision of the amortisation table in order to make it strictly equitable to the Persian Government, and I am therefore to transmit to you herewith a revised table drawn up by the Accountant-General at the India Office showing the amount payable monthly by the Persian Government, as well as the sum to be retained in each case by the Imperial Bank. Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive your formal acceptance of the amended scheme which he is about to refer to the Persian Government also, and I am to state that in the meantime he approves of the procedure proposed in your letter under reply, subject to adjustment hereafter in accordance with the new table. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. [2913 ff — 1 ] COPY TO INDIA j SBCftST AnV'g Ng-tT qNote by Accountant-General, India Office, dated 22nd April 1018. If it be decided to offer the Persian Government a reduction in the amount of the monthly instalments, the correct sum to be paid at the end of each month, to cover principal and interest at an effective rate of five per cent, per annum, will be 2,467b 3 . 9 . 6 d. A schedule is attached showing the division of these monthly payments into principal, arrears of interest on 31st March 1910, and interest subsequently accruing, and the net amount to be paid by the Bank of Persia in respect of each month. The Bank would retain one-lifth of the interest payments as they collect them. I do not think that any option should be given them of taking a larger sum at the end of the year, as this would be equivalent to borrowing money from them at five per cent., an inconvenient and extravagant expedient. There is no clear reason for the practice which the Bank are apparently proposing to adopt of paying in interest and principal separately. When once the annuity payments are in force, interest and principal will fall due simultaneously and can more conveniently be dealt with together. Walter Badock. 22nd April 1913. S. 208.

Manager. f The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.OF HIS MAJESTY’S SERVICE.Office, The draft contract is in some ways re mo, rkahle. Ordinarily f one contract would he drawn up fixing the price of the loan and the remuneration (hy way of underwriting commission or otherwise) of the issuing house, and also imposing on the issuing hoi se a binding obligation to bring out the loan. To deal simultaneously with the three matters (price, remuneration, and binding contract to issue) would generally be considered essential. Certainly the first two would scarcely ever be settled apart from one another, seeing that they are really interdependent. When the price is high, the remuneration must also be comparatively high; when the price is low and likely to attract the public, the remuneration ought to be low also. In the present case the ordinary procedure is departed from. Of the three points mentioned, the draft contract settles one only, viz. remuneration, which is to be Tify whatever the priceprice of ifi&amp;ue. The ieeutng house enters into no binding obligations whatever. The Persian government is, in due course, +o fix a price of issue; but 'if the price fixed shall be deemed inadvisable by the contractors they shall have the right to retire'. ft is of course not impossible that a cont pact like this may lead to a transaction in which ^he issuing house will have a reasonable profit and no more. Bu+ the Persian G-overnment will be in a very unfavourable position if it ever wishes to bring out the loan under pressure of emergency. In such an event the issuing house would be very likely to insist on an issue price low enough to be very attractive to the public, and would in that case receive £300,000 on £4,000,000) as its own profit, while the public would take the loan.CONFIDENTIAL. f * 5 °CT1 91 .

I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft Contract. Contract made the _ day of , 1911, between the Imperial Government of Persia on the one hand and Messrs. Seligman Brothers, of 18, Austin Friars, in the City of .London, hereinafter called the contractors of the other part. WHEREAS the Imperial Government of Persia are desirous of issuing a loan, to the amount of 4,00(),00oL, for the purpose of paying off the consolidated debt due to the Banque d’Escompte de Perse amounting to 60,000,000 krans, equal at to . an( ^ running at per cent, interest per annum, and for the financing of other disbursements considered urgently necessary by the Imperial Government of Persia, including reproductive public works such as inigation, the development of commerce and agriculture, the improvement of the trade routes, and the establishment of effectual financial control both at Tehran and in the provinces.

[2178 1]X '— 2 6. The bonds to carry interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, which the Imperial Government of Persia will pay in London in sterling, and to be framed in the usual form of Government bonds. The loan to be redeemable at par by means of an accumulative sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum, commencing three years after the^ date of the loan contract, and extending over a period not exceeding thirty-seven years. The drawings will take place in London at the contractors offices in of each year, and the drawn bonds will be paid off at par on the ^ day of the montli following, after which date the interest on the bonds so drawn will cease. 7. The Imperial Government of Persia binds itself to observe ’and perform all the provisions contained in the said bonds as to the payments of the loan and the interest thereon and otherwise. 8. The Imperial Government of Persia has the right to redeem the whole loan at par at any time after the year 1925 after giving six months’ notice. 9. The Impei ial Government of Persia specifically assigns to the service of this loan the full receipts now or hereafter to be received from the revenues and receipts detailed in this paragraph under the sub-heads (a), (6), (c), (d), and (c), less the actual cost of collection. (a.) The passports, both internal and external. (6.) The Crown lands in the departments of Azerbaijan and Tehran. (c.) The maliat in the departments of Azerbaijan and Tehran. (d.) The maliat and the Crown lands in the remaining departments, it being under stood that, with the exception of the departments of Azerbaijan and fell ran, the receipts of the maliat and the Crown lands are not separated. (e.) The receipts from the mint. The Imperial Government of Persia guarantees that this shall include all amounts made by it upon currency minted either within or without the Empire of Persia. 10. The Imperial Government of Persia further specifically assigns to the service of this loan, and as a first charge thereon (subject only to prior charges thereon amounting to l. per annum, and made up as follows : (1) , (2) , (3) , (4) , (5) , (6) , (7) ). (a.) The full net customs receipts of every description which the Government now is, or at any time hereafter may be, entitled to collect and receive at all ports and places in the Empire of Persia with the exception of the Gulf ports—Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohammerah, and Ahwaz. (b.) The full net customs receipts of every description which the Government now is, or at any time hereafter may be, entitled to collect and receive at the Gulf ports, including Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohammerah, and Ahwaz after the present charges are paid, which amount now to l. per annum, and which are made up as follows : (1) , (2) , (3) , (4) , (5) ,_ (G) , (7) , and will in the year 1917 be increased by 17,000L per annum, and in 19 by 11. If the revenues and receipts from the above-mentioned sources shall at any time fall short of the amount required for the service of the loan, the Imperial Government of Persia hereby agrees it will make good such deficiency from other Government revenues. 12. If at any future date the arrangements under which the Imperial Government of Persia covenants to pay certain revenues and receipts to the Banque d’Escompte de Perse and the Imperial Bank of Persia sliould in the case of either or both b ulks be abrogated or terminated, then the Imperial Government of Persia hereby agrees that during the continuance of this loan the revenues and receipts so liberated are to be paid weekly for account of the service of this loan to such agents in the Persian Empire as the contractors may nominate. 13. The full net revenues and receipts detailed in paragraphs 9 and 10 shall be kept with such bank, banks, institutions, company, person, or persons as the Treasurer- General and the contractors shall agree. Such full net revenues and receipts, less the deductions mentioned in paragraphs 9 and 10, shall be brought into one account in the office of the Treasurer-General, which account shall be debited monthly with one-twelfth of the amount necessary to defray the annual charge for the interest and amortisation of this loan (but all such receipts shall be transferred to the contractors until there is an amount in their hands sufficient to defray the proportion due for the next six months). For such sums the contractors will give interest at the published rate of the Bank of England, less l£ per cent., but the said rate is never to be less than per cent, from the date of receipt to the date when the coupon or amortisation is due.3 The Imperial Government of Persia absolutely and unconditionally guarantees that if for any cause whatever, including force majeure, those banks or persons with whom the revenues and receipts have been deposited should fail to transfer the full amounts the Treasurer-General, or the Treasurer-General should fail to transfer the full ^mounts as due to the contractors, then the Imperial Government of Persia will make up such deficiency at once, and will not in any way draw on such revenues and receipts until the deficiency has been made good. The Imperial Government of Persia further undertakes not to draw upon the said revenues in any way whatsoever until the due amount has been transferred to London, nor to in any way anticipate such revenues and receipts. Further, the Imperial Govern ment of Persia guarantees that the accounts mentioned in this paragraph shall be under the sole control of the Treasurer-General. 14. Should at any future date the monthly payments for three months be insufficient to meet the interest and amortisation charges for the period, then the contractors are to have the right to take over the administration of all or any of the^ revenues and receipts detailed in paragraph 9, and deduct from such revenues and receipts the amounts due for the interest and amortisation of this loan and all charges incurred for the collection ; the surplus to be held at the disposal of the Imperial Government of Persia. Further, the contractors shall have the right to take over all such revenues and receipts mentioned in paragraph 10 which may then or thereafter be free. 15. During the continuance of this loan, or for such less period as the contractors may desire, the contractors shall be the sole agents and representatives in England with respect to this loan and all matters connected with it, but undertake no pecuniary liability. 16. For the expenses of disbursing the coupons and paying bonds annually drawn or called for redemption in the event of earlier redemption, the Imperial Government of Persia shall pay the contractors at the rate of one-half of the amounts so disbursed or paid. 17. At the request of the Imperial Government of Persia, the contractors may at any date liberate such of the securities as they see fit. 18. The bonds and coupons of this loan are for ever exempt from all or any Persian tax or deduction, and the interest and capital will not at any time be liable to any diminution from the Imperial Persian Government. 19. In case of any divergence between the readings of the Persian and English versions of this contract, the English text is to be taken as conclusive. 20. This contract is to be signed at Tehran by the Persian Minister of Finance and the Treasurer-General on behalf of the Imperial Persian Government, and by Lieutenant-Colonel H. It. Beddoes or any other person appointed on behalf of the contractors; but it is not to be considered as definitive until signed in London by the Persian Minister to the Court of St. James on behalf of the Imperial Government of Persia and by one of the partners in the firm of Messrs. Seligman Brothers on behalf of the contractors. 21. The Imperial Government of Persia agrees that during the continuance of this loan the office of Treasurer-General of Persia as existing prior to the 27th day of June, 1911, shall be maintained, and the powers and duties thereof shall not, during the j period of the loan, be diminished, except with the consent of the contractors. The said l office of Treasurer-Gener.il shall not be held by anyone except a citizen of the United States of America, or a subject of a European Power ; in the former case to be approved by the Government of the United States of America, in the latter case by the Government of the European State of which he may be a citizen, and approved by the Imperial . Government of Persia. 22. In order to facilitate and increase the guarantees heretofore pledged for the repayment of this loan, and to secure proper supervision and control of the expenditure of the surplus thereof, it is hereby agreed by the Imperial Government of Persia that the following organisation of the personnel of the Treasurer-Generals stan s ia e authorised :— (a.)

All expenditure of the surplus arising from the loan shall be made by the Treasurer-General for the reproductive public works and purposes mentioned in the preamble of this contract, upon the authorisation of the Persian Medjliss, and with the consent of the representative of the contractors herein after provided for. 23. It is hereby agreed that, during the actual period of expenditure, the contractors may appoint and maintain at Tehran a representative of then interests, whose sanction shall be necessary for the expenditure of the surplus arising from the loan which may be approved by the Persian Medjliss. 1 he salary of such representative is hereby fixed at /. per annum, to he borne by the Imperial Go\ernment of I ersia. 24. All salaries authorised by the present paragraphs of this contract are hereby made a first charge on the receipts and portions of receipts hereintofore pledged to guarantee the repayments of the loan, provided that all other loan charges shall have been first paid therefrom. . 25. It is stipulated by the contractors that they will not conclude the business unless they have letters from the Treasurer-General of Persia, giving figures satis factory to the contractors concerning the revenue pledged (and letters from the British and Russian Governments giving their moral support to the loan), ::: ‘ in terms satisfactory to the contractors, the contractors being fully empowered to use ah such letters, or extracts from them, at their option, in the published prospectus. It is also stipulated that a prospectus of the loan in its final form shall be signed by a duly authorised representative of the Imperial Government of Persia in London. 26. Subject to the definite signature in London the contractors undertake to hold 20 per cent of the amount of this loan at the disposal of the Imperial Government of Persia within three months after the signature in Tehran, and 20 per cent, monthly thereafter. 27. Should there, however, be any serious crisis in the money markets of London, Paris, New York, or Berlin, or a political upheaval anywhere in the world, between the signature of the contract in Tehran and London, so as to make the public issue impossible or undesirable in the opinion of the contractors, then the contractors have the right to retire from the business, or with the consent of the Imperial Government of Persia to postpone the issue. 28. Should the contractors not have definitely accepted this contract within threet months of the signatures aforesaid being affixed in Tehran then this contract is to he deemed entirely null and void, unless the delay is caused by the failure to receive the letters referred to in paragraph 25, in which case the contractors shall have the period extended by the same number of days as elapse between the signature in Tehran and the receipt of the last of the said letters. o * Colonel Beddoes tells me that these words will be omitted from the contract to spare the suscepti bilities of the Medjliss.

Spring-Rice’s note of the 31st August, 1907?Sind our joint note of the 7th April, 1910 I am not sure how far former of these would preclude a loan on the Seligman lines if Seligmans withdrew owing to opposition of the two Powers [group undecypherable | regards the joint note of last year, it has always seemed to me that it would be difficult to insist that the unpledged surplus f? 10 per cent.] of revenues pledged to us should not be pledged to a third party, provided that surplus had been offered and refused by a British group.

Seligman contemplated taking it, which Sir G. Barclay much doubts. He accordingly submits that, in paying off the overdraft, Messrs. Seligman would not, as suggested, be supplanting the bank, and adds that he presumes that His Majesty’s Government would not make it a condition of their consent to the loan that the overdraft should not be extinguished. I should be obliged if you would let me know whether you were referring in our conversation to the overdraft, as Sir G. Barclay surmises, or to the recent loan made by the bank, and whether the bank’s objections to the extinction of the former are as great as to that of the latter. PERSIA.

I have told Colonel Reddoes that I thought there might be difficulty about the surplus of the southern customs as security for the Seligman loan. He pointed out that the surplus is only intrinsically valuable if order is restored, which can be only if Persian Government obtain a large loan. I asked him whether the withdrawal of southern customs would cause Seligman to withdraw. He replied that he was not in a position to say, but pointed out that, though at the present intrinsically valueless, a lien on southern customs would carry great weight with the public as evidence of the support of His Majesty’s Government.

Moreover, default is only likely if the Persian Government cannot collect maliat, and if they cannot collect it even with the assistance ol Shuster, I do not see how Seligman could do so without more help from His Majesty’s Government than the latter would be willing to give.

We should object to such a project, as we are bound to support the Imperial Bank, which has so long been identified with British interests in the Gulf and has a prior claim on our support. We shall therefore make it a condition of our consent to the loan that the Imperial Bank shall not be repaid out of this loan. In any case we could not consent to further liens on the southern customs, as the bank are constantly being pressed for advances to the Persian Government, and would not continue to comply with these requests, unless there were surplus customs to fall back on. We are anxious not to oppose the loan or to make unnecessary difficulties, but we must first be assured that British interests will not suffer, as they would if the Imperial Bank were paid off and lost their position in the Gidf.

YOUR telegram No. 2,5 [of 7th September: Seligman loan]. It seems to me that, whether or not loan is issued exclusively on London market, it will be impossible entirely to guard against the risk of such portion of the bonds falling in time into foreign hands as might give some foreign Power a footing in the Gulf. But this risk is inseparable from any loan secured on southern customs when once the bonds are on the market. It maybe argued that risk is rendered as far as possible innocuous by the omission of customs revenues from those securities which Seligman are entitled to administer in / the event of default (see my telegram No. 361 [of 26th August], paragraph S). At the same time it might be well to keep surplus of southern customs for the Persian Railway Syndicate. Possibly Seligman might be induced to renounce it. Although denomination [sic'] of bonds in sterling, francs, dollars, and roubles is provided for in the draft contract, I am given to understand that this clause is likely to be struck out, and I am assured that there is no question of floating any part of the loan on any foreign market but the Russian, and this only in case Russian Government i desired it, though I understand Seligman think that it is likely that Russian Government j may take up a small portion of converted bank loan.O' * ■ .I * CONFIDENTIAL f' 8 SEP1911 Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

WE have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated the 22nd September, 1910, in reply to our letter of the 15th instant. 1. In answer to your question with regard to the security it is proposed to assign for the loan, we would refer you to the previous correspondence, especially to our letter of the 13th May, in which we categorically informed you that the contract would only be entered into if approved by the Foreign Office. At this stage we have not taken up the question of any particular security, which would be largely dependent on the size of the loan. We can only repeat that no security will be considered until after consultation with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and subject to the approval of your department. We desire to express our regret that our former assurance upon this point appears to have been overlooked. 2. With regard to your second question, e.g., “what proportion of shares would be offered for sale in foreign markets ? ” it is not contemplated to issue any shares at all. We propose to follow the procedure usually adopted in similar cases, such as the loan we financed for the city of Rio de Janeiro for 2,000,000L last year under the guarantee of the Brazilian Government. The contract with the Persian Government would be solely in our name, and we should issue the bonds here, and in case we considered the amount offered too large for England to absorb, the remainder would be distributed amongst our correspondents in the countries named, who would either make a public issue or sell them in blocks, whichever they might find the more convenient. 3 . We would beg to point out that no power on earth can prevent foreigners obtaining bonds if they wish, as they would buy them in London once an issue is made ; in the same way as exchequer bonds of this country are largely held abroad. No company will be formed to float this loan, the entire control remaining in our hands. 4. If His Majesty’s Government would prefer it, we can arrange a loan for about 1 , 000 , 000 /. without the co-operation of our foreign correspondents, but would rather arrange for an issue of 2,000,000/. or 2,500,000/. with their co-operation, in either case the contract being subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. We have reason to believe that our financial assistance to Persia would be favourably received by the Russian Government, and we feel strongly that if any real good is to be rendered to Persia nothing less than 2,000,000/. or 2,500,000/. will be of permanent service. \Y e uow ask whether, if the following conditions aie adhered to, oecretary oir Edward Grey is prepared to allow us to issue abroad as well as heie, and to view the proposed loan favourably. 5. (1.) No foreign correspondents to acquire any control oi any kind or to take any official part in the negotiations, their sole interest consisting of a possible purchase from us of the bonds to be offered for sale. . . , (2.)

In our letter of the 14th October we asked whether our action would meet with the approval of Sir Edward Grey, and we desire to emphasise that, beyond a formal acknowledgment, we have received no answer to this question until to-day.^ ^ 21st Octol|er we informed you by letter that we had given ijp all idea of a foreign issue, and proposed to float the loan only in England, and again beyond a mere acknowledgment we have had no answer to this letter. , , , n , . _ The formal application from the Persian Government, dated the 10th October, reached us yesterday, and at an interview given by Mr. Maxwell yesterday to Colo Beddoes and Mr. C.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant respecting your negotiations with the Persian Government for a loan. I am to inform you in reply that on the 7th April last the British and Russian Ministers at Tehran, in an identic note, informed the Persian Government that their Governments could only consent to loans being raised by the Persian Government from parties other than themselves on the conditions :— (1) That neither the customs revenues nor any other revenues now assigned to the service of Russian or British loans could be pledged as guarantees for further financial operations. (2.) That a consolidation of all the Persian Government’s debts to Great Britain and Russia must first be effected. I am to state that apart from this warning, which was perfectly impartial as regards all firms, His Majesty’s Government have taken no action with the Persian Government, whose attitude has been quite independent. If, however, His Majesty’s Government should have, in the future, to take any action, they cannot consent to use their influence in support of any proposals which would displace the Imperial Bank of Persia or seriously prejudice its interests, and must reserve their right at any time to take such action as British interests in their opinion require.

A June 1911, the powers in question are very wide, and the undertaking that they should continue undimin ished (save with Messrs .Seligman f s consent) for a period possibly of forty years is an engagement oj a stringent character. If the Persian Government, however, are prepared to give it, and provided that it will always be open to H.M.Govt. toto protest effectually if the holder^ of the office should exercise his powers in a manner detrimental to British interests, there would seem I to he no reason why obj ect ion should\ he taken to the condition* With regard to Messrs.Seligman, it is observed that, besides having the power to give or withhold the consent above mentioned, they would be empowered, in the event of de- fault, to administer certain Jr evenues^ and that the expenditure of the loan by the Treasurer-General would be subject to the consent of their represent at ive at Tehran* The Marquess of Grewe has no precise information as to the character of the firm, or the amount of reliance that may be placed on their continu ing to act in accord with H.M.Govt,, but he assumes that Sir K.Grey, is satisfied on this point, and also as to the sufficiency of the undertaking that the firm's representative at Tehran will act in agreement with the British and Russian Legations. exp ress i on of op in i on on th e questions of policy involved m the proposed loan is contained in your to the foregoing obser- j . 1 vat ions f Il ls L &amp;rdshup sees no reason f so far as Indian interests are con cerned for obj ect mg to the terns letters under reply. proposed© proposed.

Sir O.Barclay to Sir Edward Grey—[Received July 3 .) (No. 95. Confidential.) Sir - „ Teh ran, June 13, 1911. AMTH reference to my despatch No. 84 of the 6 th June, I have the honour to transmit herewith an English text of a further Bill submitted to the Medjliss on the 8 th instant, and passed practically with unanimity and without modification at to-day’s sitting. I he twelve articles contained in the Bill were originally drafted by Mr. Morgan Shuster, and tianslated into I ersian for submission to the Medjliss. The preamble, of which I enclose an English translation, was drafted by the Finance Minister, who introduced the measure. A glance at this law' will show that it defines Mr. Shuster’s functions, and endows him with very wide powers in the domain of finance. I he first impression which the Bill conveys is that Mr. Shuster is about to undei take the complete remodelling of the Ministry of Finance, and to commence operations by making a clean sweep of the existing machinery. The Minister of I inance, however, when questioned on the subject yesterday by Mr. Churchill, replied that this point had, in fact, already been raised by the Finance Committee of the Medjliss, which was then examining the Bill, and he had been able to explain to it that Mr. Shuster had no such intentions, at any rate, for the present. He was going first to organise the Treasury Department, on the lines laid down in the Bill, but he would not be able for some time to deal with the departments which carried on the intricate business of the Finance Ministry with the provinces, &amp;c. l am unfortunately unable to say with any certainty what Mr. Shuster’s view's or intentions are, as all my information on the subject has so far been obtained indirectly, Mr. Shuster not having yet called on me, or on any of my colleagues. I have no doubt that he finds the work before him so absorbing and the task of such magnitude that he can spare no time for social amenities. Mr. Mornard, the Belgian Director of Customs, is inclined to look upon Mr. Shuster’s aloofness—I believe they have not yet met—as an indication of hostility on the latter’s part. Mr. Wood, the chief manager of the Imperial Bank, is already in constant touch with the Treasurer-General, and has, I believe, formed a high opinion of his capability, earnestness, and determination. On the Persians Mr. Shuster has apparently created a great impression, and the unanimity with which all parties have given him the full powers for which he has asked proves that they repose the utmost confidence in him. I understand that he does not expect to stop peculation and leakage at once, and that he will be quite content if he succeeds within the next six months or a year to stop the larger leakages, or, in other words, to prevent the wholesale robbery of the State Treasury by corrupt officials, and to reduce wanton or foolish extravagance. He has let it be widely known that if he finds obstacles placed in his way by any person or persons he will denounce them to the Medjliss, and if he cannot remove their obstruction he will return to America. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1. Finance Minister's Bill presented to the Medjliss at the Sitting of the 8th June, 1911, and passed 13th June, 1911. Preamble. THE purpose of this Bill is so clear that a cursory examination of it wall at once elucidate and make manifest all its objects. [2105 c—2]2 At present the financial conditions of the Government are truly regrettable, and if we wish to save ourselves, the measures we take must be very effective and courageous. The Medjliss has already, by the law of the 2nd of Sefer, 1329 (A.H.) (2nd February, 1911), approved the engagement of a Treasurer-General of the State, and the Government, in accordance with this sanction, have engaged a particular American in order that he should have general and effective supervision and control over the revenue and expenditure of the State. It is obvious that whenever we entrust an undertaking to a certain person, he will not be able to carry it out until given those full powers essential for the purpose. In the affairs of the world, whether official or personal, as a general rule, if a person undertakes a grave responsibility without previously obtaining the necessary powers, he is either a fool or a rogue. So far the financial and monetary arrangements of the Persian Government have been conducted without system and through different officials. Each one of these officials has, during some months, carried on his important duties, which refer to fundamental principles now recognised to concern the Persian people. Without criticising the work undertaken by these officials, or referring to the conflicting views held on the subject, the unfortunate consequences of these differences of opinion have become well known both to the Government and to the people. Confusion in the administrations, the absence of effective control in financial affairs, and the impossibility of bringing about real reform, and finally the uncertainty as to those really responsible for illegal acts, will undoubtedly bring the country to a state of irreparable ruin. If we wish to save ourselves from this dangerous position we must adopt extraordinary measures to reform these conditions, because it is impossible to fell a forest with a pen-knife. The financial affairs of the State are of that particular nature which cannot take into consideration personal or political interests or temporary conditions. Therefore, in order to introduce new and permanent reforms in the financial and monetary affairs of the Persian Government, the following measures, which have received the most careful and attentive consideration, are submitted to the Medjliss, and their urgency is drawn attention to : — Article 1. The r J reasurer-General of the Empire of Persia is entrusted with the direct and effective control of all financial and fiscal operations of the Persian Government, including the collection of all receipts of every description, and the control and accounts of all Government expenditure. Article 2. The 1 reasurer-General shall establish the following organisations in the Ministry of Finance : — 1 . Chief office for the collection of the maliat, taxes, and Government revenues of every description, whether such maliat and taxes actually exist, or such as shall hereafter be established. 2. Chief office for the inspection and control of all receipts and approved expenditure, and the keeping of accounts in connection therewith. 3. Chief office for fiscal operations. All transactions of the Government with the bank, and operations respecting the minting of bullion, and of exchange, loans, interest, amortisation, conversion, concessions, and financial agreements, whether such agreements yield a revenue to the Government, or whether it [sic] imply a financial obligation of the Government, shall, the provisions of the terms of the laws being duly observed, be effected by this office. Article 3. I n each of the three offices referred to in article 2 the Treasurer-General shall establish such sections and sub-sections as he may deem necessary. Article 4. Whenever the central organisation shall have been effected, the Treasurer-General shall, whenever appropriate, establish the services he may consider essential for the organisation of each of the different provinces.Article 5. The Treasurer-General shall be charged with the custody of the treasury of the Empne, and no Government expenditures shall, without his signature, in the case of direct mandates, or, without his authorisation, in the case of credit orders, be made. Article 6. The Tieasurer-Genei al shall prepare such regulations as he thinks fit for the proper execution of the improvements referred to in the preceding articles, which regulations shall, after being vised and published, have the force of law. Article 7. A credit of 60,000 tonans shall be granted to the Treasurer-General for the purpose of establishing a special corps of inspection. In the event of new employes under contract f r the establishment of such corps of inspection being required, the contracts shall, as n stomary, be submitted to Parliament for approval. Article 8. The preparation of the budget of the Empire, which is to be submitted to Parliament on behalf of the Government, is one of the functions of the Treasurer- General, and all the Ministers and Government employes are bound to furnish and submit such information without delay, as the Treasurer-General may require. Article 9. The Treasurer-General shall make any such economies in the Government expenditure and transactions as are suitable—this being one of his specific functions. Article 10. The Treasurer-General shall prepare and submit to the Government every quarter a report on the situation of the finances of the Empire. Article 11. The Treasurer-General shall make the necessary researches as to improvements in existing financial laws and the creation of new sources of revenues, which shall be at the same time suitable, profitable, and favourable to the Empire, so that such may be submitted by the Government to Parliament. Article 12. The Treasurer-General shall have authority over the personnel of the services which, by virtue of the above articles, shall be established under his control.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G.

Tehran, August 21, 1911, 9 p.m. SCHUSTER visited the Russian Minister yesterday and again pressed him hard regarding appointment of Stokes. He said he was willing to undertake that Stokes should not be employed in the north except for organisation work in Tehran, that he should remain in the capital for only six months, and should be then sent to Shiraz. He held out hopes of arranging for a counterbalancing appointment of a Russian officer in the north. He promised, moreover, to exclude from certain negotiations for a loan which he had opened with Colonel Beddoes the conversion of Russian Bank’s loan, and to negotiate this conversion with the Russian Government. • Russian Minister, while holding out no hope that his Government would change their attitude, promised to submit to them these proposals, and he has since told me that he is reporting by no means unsympathetically. After his conversation with Russian Minister Schuster induced “ Times ” correspondent to refrain from sending a report of an interview which he had given him which would have embittered matters. He also told Russian Minister and me that he would for the present withhold public statement which he was preparing.

I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 1 . The Medjliss, May 30, 1911. Bill for the Control of the Loa7i Money. The President .—“ As the Ministers have come to the Medjliss, the Finance Committee’s report regarding the Control Bill will be read.” The Bill, which had been submitted by the Government and approved by the committee, ran as follows :— Preamble. General and effective control in respect to the new loan from the Imperial Bank, and the expenditure specially provided for out of it, is the natural and particular duty of the Ministry of Finance. One of the greatest defects of the present financial administration of the Persian Government is the superfluous number of departments and minor sections. The most obvious result of this state of affairs is the difficulty in establishing the duties of each department and the responsibility attached to what each floes. Therefore, it is obvious that to introduce a new system with undefined responsibilities, i.e., similar to the system we now have, would only increase the confusion now prevailing in our administrations. Consequently, what is now necessary is that we should have a more simplified system which will give a better result, and not to add another room to the rooms of this administration. Hie money produced by this loan is in no way different to the money realised by the Customs, the direct taxes, or the general revenues of the State. On the other hand, the control and special supervision over the collection and expenditure of a laige sum Is the duty of a department which must necessarily possess three important qualifications, viz &gt; honesty, experience in finance, and definite responsibility. But is it possible t ut j a committee of fifteen persons can fulfil the two last-mentioned conditions r* Some days ago the general control of Persia’s finances was entrusted to a loieign employe who has the post of Treasurer-General, and who has come to Peisia wit 1 j 3 assistants to reform the financial administration. If we desire to render him responsr e mr the proper working of our financial administration we must, on our sit e, give nm the required authority to carry out this difficult task.

The following is a summary of the items of expenditure voted by the Medjliss : — It will he observed that, with the exception of 20,000L for the Persian repre sentatives abroad, the whole amount is set aside for military purposes, and that all the money available out of the loan—something over 400,0007.—has been at once ear-marked. As regards item No. 4, the programme states that out of the 200,000 tomans allocated to the gendarmerie, 80,000 tomans is for the gendarmerie of the south of Persia, while the balance is to be kept in hand until after the arrival of the Swedish officers, when it will be available for expenditure in accordance with their recom mendations.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 0.) (No. 73.) Sir, Tehran, May 16, 1911. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 127, 142, and 152 of the 17tli and 28th April and the 3rd May respectively, as to the proceedings in the Medjliss in regard to the proposed issue by the Persian Government of a loan of 1,250,COOL on the London market, through the agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia, I have the honour to transmit herewith (Enclosure 1) a copy of the contract signed on the 8 th instant by the Minister of Finance and the chief manager of the Imperial Bank. The project, which had been put before the Medjliss by Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek’s Cabinet at the end of last year, was referred to the Finance Committee of the House, and came up for discussion at a public sitting on the 22nd April, when Momtaz-ed- Dowleh, the Finance Minister of Sipahdar’s Cabinet, was in charge of it. The late Sani-ed-Dowleh, who was Finance Minister in the former Cabinet, had drawn up a list of expenditure and a scheme of control for the proper handling of the money. I enclose a translation of this document (Enclosure 2) which is interesting, as, though slightly modified by the Finance Committee of the Medjliss, it shows that the necessity for control by European officials is thoroughly appreciated, and that a serious attempt was contemplated to prevent peculation and waste. At the sitting of the 22nd April, the scheme of expenditure and control was brought up first. The list of expenditure had been modified by the present Cabinet in accordance with altered conditions since its preparation by Sani-ed-Dowleh (see Enclosure 3). At its first reading the Opposition, who showed from the outset that they intended to resist the measure with all their power, elicited the fact that the present Government had already purchased a quantity of rifles and ammunition from the Russian Army Head-quarters at Tiflis without submitting to any sort of control, and that part of the money for which a vote was asked in article 4 (Enclosure 3) was to cover this item. The criticism of the Opposition on this score was so embarrassing to the Government that the Ministers, finding themselves hard pressed, brou ght the sitting to an end by stating that they w r ere invited o ut to dinner. The debate was resumed on the 25th April, when it was agreed to replace the project of expenditure and control by the Loan Bill itself, and to append a clause to the effect that if the loan were sanctioned its proceeds should be locked up at the Imperial Bank till the plan of expenditure and control passed through the House. The Loan Bill was accordingly read a first time on the 27th April, and a second time on the 2nd May, and was strenuously opposed by the Democrats, whose principal spokesman was Wahid-ul-Mulk (formerly “ limes correspondent at lehran). The criticisms directed against the measure by this gentleman were of a root-and-branch order, but his eloquence and persistency were of no avail against the weight of the combined supporters of the Government when a show of hands was called for by the Pr es i The Bill was eventually passed by the majority on the 2nd May, and the contiact was signed six days later. The position therefore now is as follows : , . As far as the Persian Government is concerned, the amount realised by the issue of the loan is not available until the Medjliss has approved the Government s proposals j as to expenditure and control. n ^ ^ The agreement entered into between the bank and tlm I ersian Guvnrnment on the 26th May, 1910 (see Mr. Mailings despatch No. 92 of the 8 th June, 1910), by which the Government’s debts to the bank were consolidated and interest thereon fixed at 7 per cent., is terminated by virtue of article 6 of the new agreement and the bank will be paid off without waiting for further sanction by the Medjhss. This comes to a , reduction of interest from 7 to 5 per cent, on 32,374,216'80 krans (oi, saj, , . a 53 krans per £), the figure at which the amalgamation of last year will stand on tire 20th May, 1911. [2058 /—4] i w &lt;5 /It will be remembered that, at the urgent request of the Persian Government, the Imperial Bank made further advances to the Government during the kst few months in anticipation of the sterling loan. These amount, with interest up to the 20 h May, to 3,439,666-65 krans (or, at 53 krans per £, to, say, 64,9001.), which will also be pai off without further reference to the Medjliss. „ i • i ^ i i The net produce of the sterling loan being 1 , 093 , 7501 ., from which the bank wi, deduct about 675,7001., the balance available to the Persian Government will be about 418,0001, ^ a(1( j t j iat t ]- ie Persian Government’s long outstanding liability in London, on account of a lottery concession granted in 1889 by the late Lasr-ed- in Shah, is taken over by the Imperial Bank, which, in taking over the loan i 2 . left itself a margin for this purpose. ^ ’ G.'

Gordon to enquire what progress was being made in the matter of the loan which Messrs. Seligman propose to make to the Persian Government. Mr. Mallet, who received them, read to them Sir G. Buchanan’s telegram No. 84 of the 11 th instant. Sir T. Jackson stated that Messrs. Seligman’s chief house was in New York, and that he thought it probable that the American financial advisers were cognisant of the proposal. Mr. Mallet repeated to him that His Majesty’s Government could not prevent the Persian Government from obtaining money from outside sources provided that the conditions, of which he was aware, were not infringed. Sir T. Jackson stated that he quite understood the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, but observed that the advances of the Imperial Bank under their last aareement could be paid off at a year’s notice, and he presumed that if the Persian Government obtained a loan of 4,000,000Z., they would repay the Imperial Bank. The Aiudo-Indian advance could not be repaid without the consent of His Majesty’s Government, but the amount was, of course, insignificant, and the Gulf customs would carry a much larger loan. Sir T. Gordon observed that he had heard a few weeks since that some important houses were considering the question of a loan. These were the Burmah Oil Company, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Messrs. Grey, Dawes and Co., Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co., and Sir T. Gordon thought that possibly, in view of the information received by His Majesty’s Government, these loans might be those referred to by Seligman. Mr. Mallet said that, if this were the case, an arrangement might be come to which would perhaps, include the Imperial Bank itself. r I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.

He is of opinion that it would be advantageous if some of the more important British firms engaged in commercial enterprise in Persia participated in the loan. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. [1975 x —2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governmp.nt l IN continuation of the conversation one of our firm and Colonel Beddoes had with Mr. McKinnon Wood on the 29th March with reference to the attitude of the Imperial Russian Government towards a future loan to be granted to the Persian Government, we have the honour to inform you that the member of our firm who was in Russia has now returned, and we are in a position to give fuller particulars. It was mentioned in your letter of the 22 nd September last that “His Majesty’s Government would not \iew with favour any proposal of the kind in question unless the consent of the Russian Government had previously been obtained,” and with this knowledge our representatives, before taking any steps in Tehran, were desirous of ascertaining the views of the Russian Government. In St. Petersburgh they had the opportunity of meeting the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Finance, who were both favourably disposed towards a fresh loan on the following conditions, viz. :— 1 . The Russian Government would support nothing which was not approved by His Britannic Majesty’s Government. 2 . The terms and conditions of the loan would have to be arranged in Tehran subject to the approval of both the Russian and English Ministers, who must be kept fully informed at all stages of the proceedings. 3. No securities now hypothecated to the Russian Government or the Russian bank (Persian Disconto Banque) must be disturbed. Subject to these conditions the Russian Government would be prepared to give their moral support to a loan if supported by the English Foreign Office. Further, we were informed that the Russian Government would have no objection to the debt, or part of it, due to the Persian Disconto Bank being repaid, and the portion of the securities hypothecated for this debt being used for the new loan, nor to the pledging by a second charge of any balance of the securities hypothecated to it. We have the honour to ask whether, as all these conditions are in accordance with the views of the Foreign t 'ffice expressed in their former letters, Sir Edward Grey will be able to grant us the moral support of the Foreign Office, and whether he would give the necessary instructions in Tehran in order that our representative may be able to discuss the various stages of the negotiations with the English and Russian Ministers.

IN my telegrams Nos. 84 and 8G of the 11th and 12th instant I have already had the honour to report the substance of my conversations with the Minister of Finance and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Mr. Seligman’s recent visit to St. Petersburgh. M. Kokovtsoff told me that M. Wilenkin, the Russian financial agent in the United States, who is married to a Miss Seligman, introduced that gentleman to him, and that Mr. Seligman had spoken to him of a projected loan which an English syndicate was contemplating raising for the Persian Government. M. Kokovtsoff had confined himself to stating his personal views with regard to the hearing of such a loan on Russia’s vested financial interests in Persia, and had told him that, while he could not consent to the two Russian loans of 1900 and 1902 being covered by such a loan, he would not object to the repayment of the recently-converted Russian debt of 10 ,000,000 roubles. He also gave me to understand that he had expressed his readiness to consent to the new loan having a lien on the northern customs for an amount equivalent to that which they at present furnish to meet the interest on the existing Russian debt of 10,000,000 roubles in the event of the repayment of that debt. As regarded the political side of the question, he had referred him to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, as he desired to maintain a close understanding with His Majesty’s Government in all questions connected with Persian finance. The conversation which Mr. Seligman subsequently had with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs was of a more general character. M. Neratow gave him clearly to understand that the Imperial Government could not agree to support any loan to Persia without first having come to an understanding with His Majesty’s Government with regard to its amount, the sources of revenue which were to serve as a guarantee for the payment of the interest, and the objects to which the proceeds of the loan were to be applied. Until, therefore, Mr. Seligman had obtained the approval and consent of His Majesty’s Government to his project he could not promise him the support of the Imperial Government. Mr. Seligman expressed himself as perfectly satisfied, and said that he propose I returning to London, where he did not anticipate meeting with any opposition on the part of His Majesty s Government, and that he would sub sequently go to Tehran and talk over the details of the scheme with the British and Russian -Ministers MrfSeligman appears to have assured both M. Kokovtsoff and M. Neratow that he could count on the sympathy, if not on the actual support, of His Majesty s Government. I told M. Neratow' that, in view of the interest which His Majesty’s Government took in the Imperial Bank of Persia, I rather doubted whether Mr. Seligman was justified in giving him such an assurance.

IN accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your despatch No 56 of ) the 24th ultimo, I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that the arrangements for the loan to be made by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government were at present at a standstill pending the formation of the new Persian Cabinet, but that the Persian Government bad applied to the manager of the bank for an advance of 120,000 tomans. I added that you had informed Sir George Barclay by telegraph that you saw no objection to the proposed advance. M. Sazonow expressed his thanks for this communication, and said that now that the Russian conversion scheme had been carried through he had absolutely no objection to the Imperial Bank making this advance. In the subsequent course of our conversation, his Excellency observed that the time was approaching when we should have to consider seriously the advisability of arranging for a large loan being made to Persia under the auspices of the two Governments. The Persian Government needed money badly for purposes of internal administration and for the maintenance of order, and such a loan might facilitate the solution of the question of railwav construction in the North, more especially that of the projected Transpersian' Railway. His Excellency did not explain in what manner or to what extent this loan was to be applied to the purpose of railway construction, but he would appear to be adopting the view expressed in the aide-memoire communicated to us by the Russian Govern ment on the 15th August, 1908, that the question of an important Persian loan was intimately connected with that of railway concessions, and that the two questions ought to be treated simultaneously.

Tehran, February 21, 1911, 3‘55 p.m. BANK manager informs me that Persian Government have applied to him for an advance of 120,000 tomans. Part of it is urgently required for payment of troops to be sent to Shiraz, who, while unpaid, are menacing security in that town. I trust His Majesty’s Government will see its way to sanction this advance. Loan is hung up pending the formation of new Cabinet.MOTE. When the sums of &lt;£200,000 and &lt;£100,000 were lent tu Persia in 1903 and 1904 the arrangement made with the Imperial Bank of Persia (who agreed to act and are still acting as our intermediary in the matter) was that the Bank should charge the Persian Government interest at the rate of 5fo per annum, of which 4?o was to he remitted to this Office, 'the remaining 1 % being retained by the Bank as a Commission fur its services in the matter'. Any sums received in payment of the capital advanced were to he paid over to the Secretary of State without deduction (letter from Foreign Office to Imperial Bank, dated 7th April 1903, copy below). An amortisation scheme was drawn up under which Persia was to pay a fixed s^um annually for a number of years (20 years) part of which sum was to be regarded as interest on capital outstanding and part as in repayment of capital. After making a few payments the Persian Government defaulted and a new arrangement was made in 1910 1 under which the total sum outstanding at the 20th March 1910 (amounting to &lt;51314,281. 16. 4 and made up as follows Principal £272,020.15.7 (- £290, 000 1 the amount of the original loan, less £17,979.4.5 Pr i nc ipal rep a i d) In te res t £42,261. 0. 9 ) t is to he treated as a new loan. * The Persian Government are to pay interest on this sum at Sfo^and for 3 years no repayment of capital is to be required from them. After that date (i.e. March 1913) a new amortisation scheme is to come into force, under which the capital sum of £314,281. 16. 4 and interest thereonthereon are to he repaid in 15 years. Ihe Imperial Bank have written a letter to the Foreign Office in which, after remarking that the sum of &lt;£314,281 due from Persia at 20th Parch 1910 included &lt;£42,261 for arrears of interest, they state that &lt;£3452, representing one-fifth of the Interest, is due to them: and they suggest that, for the simplification of Accounts, they should he allowed to deduct £8452 from the 1st instalment of Principal payable in March 1913. The claim that this sumis due to the Bank cannot be seriously contested (provided that 'due' is understood to mean 'payable in due course' not 'immediately payable'). Any objection that might be raised would be technical and unsubstantial. But the Bank's request to be allowed to deduct the whole £8452 from the first sum received from the Persian Government in discharge of capital is unreasonable. The total first payment of capital by Persia in 1913 will amount to £14.564, representing on a strict reckoning £12.606 on account of amount originally lent £ 1.958 on account of capitalised interest. Ihe Bank ought not to expect to he allowed to receive in one payment £8452 of this total in discharqe of all their future claims to one-fifth of the capitalised interest. They might indeed he told that they are to receive their £8452 in annual instalments extendin'! over the 15 years (1913 to 1928) over which the amortisation scheme is to run. But it would in my opinion be better to adopt the Accountant General s suggestion, i • e» to agree that the first TAB.261 receivedreceived in discharge of capital shall he treated as representing repayment of capitalised interest, and that the Bank shall he allowed to retain one fifth thereof Under this arrangement the Bank vjould get their &lt;£8452 in the three years 1913, 1914, 1915. A draft in this sense is attached. I take the opportunity of mentioning that the Auditor has unofficially raised a subsidiary question relating to the proposal made above and embodied in the draft below. 'Ihe point is as follows:- The £42.261 representing capitalised interest is made up of interest of two kinds, viz:- (A) about 6^39.000 arrears of interest payable under the original amortisation scheme and compound interest thereon, and (B) about &lt;£3000 representing compound interest on instalments of capital which the Persian Crovernnent failed to pay at the time provided in the said scheme. The Auditor's query is whether the Bank are entitled to one-fifth of the latter as well as one-fifth of the former, or, in other words, whether they are entitled to share in Interest on arrears of Oapital as well as interest on arrears of Interest. Ihe financial Department is of opinion that on the whole it would hardly be reasonable to refuse to admit a title on ire part of the Bank to a share in both. It is true that in the arrangements made with the Bank in 150d nothing was said on the point, as the contingency of Persia defaulting was not contemplated. But the view that the Bank should be allowed to take one-fifth of all interest is not incompatible with the terns of the letterwaf t w INDIA OFFICE. l(o WHITEHALL, S.W. JPehruap^lDll .

WITH reference to your letter of the 10th November, 1901, in regard to financial assistance to the Persian Government, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to state that, in view of the recent telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the subject, of which copies have been transmitted to you, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that an opportunity has now occurred for recon sidering the question, of which advantage should be taken. It appears from Sir A. Hardinge’s telegrams that the success of any proposal which may be made in the matter to the Persian Government depends on its being carried through with promptitude and secrecy. In these circumstances Lord Lansdowne desires to propose the following bases for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India :— 1. The Government of India to be prepared to lend a sum not exceeding 500,000/. to the Imperial Bank of Persia at 4 per cent, interest. 2. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to accept joint responsibility for the principal and interest of the loan. 3. The Imperial Bank of Persia to make an advance of 300,000/. at once as nominal lender to the Persian Government at 5 per cent, interest, so as to receive a commission of 1 per cent, per annum xor its own services in the mattei. 4. Sir A. Hardinge to be informed that, if he attaches serious importance to the inclusion of the Caspian Sea fisheries as a security, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to authorize an advance upon them prov ided that the Southern Customs be also included in the security given, though they would prefer, haying regard to Russian susceptibilities as to their sphere of influence in Northern Persia, that the customs of Southern Persia should be the only security. Further, that if the fisheries are included, it is essential that the arrangement should be of a kind which would enable the Bank hereafter to accept, in place of the fisheries, some guarantee less .objectionable to Russia, as is suggested in Sir A.

Ministry of Finance f Tehran, October 10, 1910. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Persian Government has entered into negotiations with Messrs. Seligman Brothers, of 18, Austin Friars, London, for the conversion of the Imperial Bank of Persia’s consolidated Kran debt to a larger 5 per cent, sterling loan. As this will involve the repayment of the debt of the' Imperial Bank of Persia, I desire to give you notice, as provided in clause 5 of the contract, that this repayment will take place at latest on the 20th March, 1911. As however the Persian Government attach very great importance to the early and successful completion of the conversion I have the honour to invite your co-operation, in order that, if possible, the date may be advanced. I believe that the arrangement will be to the mutual advantage of the Persian Government and of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and as the security will probably continue to be encashed with the Imperial Bank of Persia, I trust that I may receive a favourable reply. Your assistance in the formation of the new contract will be welcome, so that it should represent an agreement between the British Government, Messrs.

In reply to your letter No. 38,773, dated the 31st October 1910, enc os mg copy of a draft contract and prospectus received from the mperia Hank of Persia relating to a proposed issue of a loan of 1,250,000Z. on behalf of the Persian Government, and to your letters Nos 39 412 and 40,770 of 3rd November and 10 th November respectively, forwarding further communications on the same subject, 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India to offer the following observations. Jf the loan were issued, the debt due to the Imperial Hank of Persia would be discharged; the holders of the loan would stand in the place of the Bank as creditors of the Persian Government; and that Government would he placed in possession of a considerable sum for administrative purposes. Lord Crewe sees no objection in principle to these changes, but, if they are to be carried out, it is evidently necessary to secure that adequate provision shall be made for safeguarding the rights which the British and Indian Governments enjoy as creditors in respect of the loan which on 2()th March last amounted to 314,2811. lb*, id. Two schemes for securing this are mentioned in the correspondence under reply : 1 lie first is that the charge on the Southern Customs in favour of holders of the new loan shall be subject to the charge already constituted in respect of the Government loan. If this alternative is to be adopted, the draft contract and draft prospectus forwarded with your letter of 31st October will require modification. I he draft contract describes the charge for the proposed new loan as subject to that for the Government loan, but, instead of providing that the charged customs receipts are to be applied in’the first instance to the service of the Government loan and thereafter to that of the proposed new loan, it states explicitly that they are to be applied to the service of the new loan and that any residue is to be held at the disposal of the Persian Government. The draft prospectus quotes the provisions in the draft contract regarding the application of the customs receipts, and without reference to the existing charge on them for the service of the Government loan, states that the service of the proposed new loan is to be the first charge on them. It is desirable that the contract and prospectus shall be so drawn up that the former shall provide explicitly for the application of the customs receipts to the service of the Government loan, in priority to the proposed new loan, and that the latter, especially if it is to be issued with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, shall correctly recite the provisions of the contract recognising the priority of the Government loan and providing for the application of the customs receipts in accordance therewith. The second alternative is that His Majesty’s Government shall receive oonds of the proposed new loan in place of the book debt which stood at 3H,28H. 16s. ±d. on 20th March last. At 85 the amount to be received WOU *d k e about 3&lt;0,000Z., and if it were provided (as seems proper), that the interest should be paid to His Majesty’s Government direct, without the present deduction of 1 per cent, for the Imperial Hank of Persia, the change would not be financially unfavourable even on the assumption that it would &amp;involve the surrender of the lien on Caspian Fisheries, Posts, and Telegraphs. The interest to be received would be 5 per cent, on 370,0001. instead of 4 per cent, on 314,281?, 16s. 4 d.; the amount to be received as repayment of capital would be the former instead of the latter sum ; and the security would scarcely be worse, since the charge on the customs for the payments to the Government instead of ranking after a charge of 70,3661. a year for 15 years, as under the agreement of 26th May 1910, would rank as part of one consolidated charge amounting to 81,000?.a year until the commencement of amortisation, and thereafter (assuming the sinking fund to be so constituted as to provide for the extinction of the loan in 40 years from the commence ment of its operation) to 94,410?. a year. If in all other respects satisfactory arrangements can be made for the proposed loan, Lord Crewe will have no objection to either of the alternative courses discussed above for safeguarding the existing claims in respect of the Government loan, provided that the Treasury undertake that, if the second alternative is adopted, they will make good to Indian revenues, as they are bound to do under the existing agreement, half ot any loss due to failure on the part of the Persian Government to pay interest and capital at the agreed time. But he shares Sir E. Grey’s opinion that the retention of the clauses in the draft contract and prospectus, providing that no change shall be made m the Persian Customs Tariff, would be incompatible with a satisfactory arrangement. The objection to the clauses in question would disappear, or would at least be very materially reduced, if they were altered so as to provide that no alteration shall be made in the Persian tariff except with the con currence of the British Government; and amended clauses of this nature would probably be as satisfactory to subscribers as those in the drafts. It would also, in Lord Crewe’s opinion, be very desirable to stipulate that the repayment of the loan by means of a sinking fund should not begin until say 15 or 20 years after the date of issue, and should extend over a long period, say 40 years. The Persian Government would be able to buy bonds in the market within the periods specified, but the British and Indian Governments would have full power, if they so desired, to retain the bonds held by them until they were drawn for redemption under the operation of the sinking fund. In view of what is said in your letter of the 10th instant, Lord re we concurs in the publication in the prospectus of the letter from His Majesty’s Government amended as proposed by Sir E. Grey.

Sir: - Viscount Morley is aware from the printed papers transmitted from this Department that the Persian £ 1 , 200,000 Government on the 10th instant invited Messrs. Selig- man Brothers of London to contract for a loan to them of One million, two hundred thousand pounds, to he secured on the Southern Customs of Persia and the proceeds to he devoted in the first place to paying off the debts owing to the Imperial Bank of Persia. a Subsequently, on the JLo' instant, the Persia Government approached the Imperial Bank of Persia with the same object; and as it appeared to Secre- n tary Sir E. Grey that a successful outcome of Messrs, Seligman Brothers' negotiations might he detrimental •jr r~r - - • ■ _' * 'E^'O 7 **** V' t~ ^ to the Interests of the Imperial Bank and oi His /Majesty* s Government, he has caused the firm to be informed that pending the negotiations now proceeding between the Persian Government and the Bank, he is unable to proceed further towards a consideration of their Under Secretary of State, India Office. {p Sic^.l+s Iqio.( / in) (58773/10) their proposals. I am directed hy the Secretary of State to in form you that he has now received from the Imperial Bank of Persia for consideration the enclosed draft contract and prospectus in regard to the proposed loan. It is understood that the price of issue would he about Eighty-five pounds per bond of One hundred pounds, at which price the actual sum realizec would be about One million, seventy-two thousand, fivs hundred pounds. Taking the debts to the Imperial £560,000 Bank of Persia under the amalgamation scheme as Six hundred and sixty thousand pounds and the debts not comprised under that scheme, but on the immediate £34,000 liquidation of, which the Bank would insist, as Thirty- four thousand pounds, there would remain a surplus for the general purposes of the Persian Government of £368,000 about Three hundred and sixty-eight thousand pounds. It is however believed that the London Stock Exchange would admit no Persian Bonds to quotation unless the Persian Government first satisfied the claimants con- cernec38772/10) concerned in the Persian Lottery Case oi 1889. This would involve a further sum of Forty thousand pounds. To turn to the actual terms of the draft contract and prospectus. Sir E. Grey thinks that there are several points in these documents which will require careful consideration. It is proposed that the loan should he issued both in London and Paris. Sir E. Grey is inclined to doubt the advisability of the issue in Paris or anywhere else outside Great Britain, but he under stands that the Bank consider that the issue of so small a loan as that contemplated would hardly require the assistance of the Paris market; and it is there fore possible that they may be ready to waive this point. The suggestion contained in paragraph 4 (a) of the draft contract that the Persian Government should bind themselves not to alter the existing Customs Tariff does not meet with Sir E. s approval. He would point out that at the present moment a pro posal has been made to levy a surcharge of Ten per cent(38773/10) cent in connexion with the scheme for policing the Southern Roaas, and he is further of opinion that certain articles of importation into Persia mainly of British or Indian origin, notably tea, are already taxed at an unduly high rate. Apart from this Sir E. Grey is not aware that such undertakings are us ually required from other Governments similar to that of Persia ana desirous of contracting loans on the security of Customs duties. He is therefore of opin ion that this proposal is unnecessary and that the words embodying it should he deleted. It will he observed that in the draft prospectus, though not in the draft contract, the proposed loan is stated to be a first charge on the Southern Cus toms. This, as Lord Morley knows, is not in accord ance with the facts, and Sir E. Grey considers that, in the state of affairs as contemplated in these two documents,His Majesty's Government should hesitate before allowing further categories of debt to be giver precedence of the Sterling Loan of 1903-1904. It should however be stated that the Imperial Bank in tend(38775/10) A ft* intend to suggest a scheme for amalgamating the Ster ling Loan with the proposed issue, and he will there fore refrain from further comment on this point until this scheme has heen submitted to him. Finally it is to be observed that the Bank sug gests that a letter should be addressee to them by His Majesty^ Government in terms set forth on the subject of the loan. Apart from the fact that the third paragraph of this letter involves an obligation on His Majesty's Government which he could not incur on his sole authority. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that, notwithstanding precedents to the contrary, it is un desirable that letters from His Majesty's Government should be published in a public prospectus, and he considers that such action should be avoided if possi ble in the present case. I am to request that I may be favoured at Lore Moriey's early convenience with his observations on the above remarks, or on any other points in the draft contract and prospectus that may appear to him toMINUTE. On the 9th.June 1910, on Pol.3498/10, the Financial Secretary noted on a reference from the Political Department as follows:- that it will he well to come to a definite under standing as soon as possible with the Imperial Bank of Persia regarding, (1). the amount that is to he set aside yearly from the customs receipts as representing interest and capital of the Government loan, and (3). the portion of the said amount that is to he retained hy the Bank as remuneration for its services in the matter. taken in hand when the letter to the Foreign Office has issued'.

The Memorandum is intended mainly for de partmental reference, and an index has been added. The Russian Loan of 1900. (£2,250,000.) * The customs of Kermanshah, it may be observed, were to be left out of account, because Her Majesty’s Government neither wished to face the risk of being called on to occupy the Kermanshah customs house, nor desired to see the Russians, on their side, in occupation of it.

See also p. 43.) 4 The value of the rouble is slightly above 2s. -• In 1899 there was much discussion as to the necessity of financial assistance to the Persian Government. A British loan on the security of the southern customs was spoken of, with a Russian loan on the security of the customs of the Caspian Ports.* Communications on the whole subject had passed between the British and Russian Govern ments, when on the 30th January 1900 the official Russian Gazette announced that the Russian Government had decided to sanction a loan to the Persian Government from the Banque des Prets of 22,500,000 roubles,! roughly 2,250,0001., on the following terms :— “ The payment of interest and of sinking fund for thf? extinction of the loan in 75 years is to be guaranteed by all the customs revenues of Persia, exclusive of those of Fars and the Persian Gulf Ports. “ In case of any delay in the payments of the service of the loan, for which the revenues thus pledged are at present more than sufficient, the Bank is to have the right of establishing a control of the said revenues. The Persian Government engages to extinguish all its previous external obligations with the proceeds of the new loan, and not to conclude without consent of the Bank any fresh foreign loan whatever until the loan of 1900 has been extinguished. The Persian Government grants the Bank the right of placing, if it thinks necessary*, on the money market bonds of the Persian Loan proportionate to the unredeemed amount of the debt, and bearing the full guarantee of the Imperial Russian Government.”Later on, Mr. Spring-Rice reported from Tehran that a clause had been added to the Loan Contract, on the Shah’s insistence, enabling the Persian Government to pay back the debt, if they wished, after ten years. Fuller particulars as to the loan were contained in a Memorandum communicated to the Foreign Office on the 17th August 1900 by Sir T. Gordon, after a conversation with the Sadr Azam at Ostend, but a certified copy of the contract was not available until it was procured by Sir A. Hardinge from M. Naus, the Belgian head of the Customs in Persia, and sent home on the 9 th December 1901. The expression used in this contract (Art. 7) as to the security of the loan is “ tontes les douanes de Perse, a Vexception dc celles “ dn Fars et des ports du Golfe Persique.” The loan could be paid off “ d partir du l er Janvier 1910,” on giving six months’ notice. 3. The British Ambassador at St. Petersburg protested against the conclusion of this Russian loan without the previous exchange of views that the Russian Government had promised. He was referred by the Foreign Minister, Count Mouravieff, to the Minister of Finance, M. de Witte, who maintained that the transaction had been of a financial, he., non-political, character and denied that the Banque des Prets was in any sense a branch of the Russian State Bank. He explained that the customs revenues from the Persian Gulf ports and the Province of Fars had been expressly excluded from the security of the loan, so as not to interfere with British interests. 4. It may here be mentioned that in 1897 the Persian Government had undertaken not to place under foreign control and supervision the customs of Southern Persia. It had in that year come to notice that a certain oculist, Dr. Ratoul, was arranging for a loan to the Persian Government on the security of the customs of the southern ports of Persia and of Kermanshah, and Mr. A. Hardinge demanded from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs “ an assurance that under no circumstances “ whatever will the control of the customs of “ Southern Persia be ceded to a foreign power.” He received on the 23rd October 1897 the following official communication : — “ You have written that there was a rumour that the’ customs of Southern Persia would be placed under foreign supervision and control as guarantee for a loan. I therefore take this oppor tunity of informing the Legation that this rumour is absolutely without foundation, and that they will never be placed under foreign supervision and control.” “ (Signed) Mushir-ed-Dowleh, “ Minister for Foreign Affairs.” {See para. 17.) 5.

It is not necessary to remind the Persian Government of the circumstances which make it impossible for Her Majesty’s Government to regard with indifference what happens in the ports above named. “ As ^is Legation has recently stated, the control of these ports by a foreign power might lead to a state of things which Her Majestv’s Government, in the interests of the Indian Empire, would _ be bound to resist. And this has been recognised by the Persian Government, who, on the 33rd October 1897, gave a written promise that the customs of Southern Persia should never be placed under foreign control and supervision. The Persian Government did not fail to bear this promise in mind during the recent negotiations, and, as the Sadr-i-Azam has informed Her Majesty’s Legation, the customs revenues of the above- mentioned ports were specially excepted from those which formed the guarantee of the Russian loan. I am to state that Her Majesty’s Government must hold the Persian Government to the strict observance of this engagement.” In reply the Persian Foreign Minister assured Mr. Spring-Rice orally, with regard to Mohammerah, that it was clearly to the interest of the Persian Government to except as many ports as possible from the Russian guarantee, and that he was quite aware that Her Majesty’s Government would not agree to any interpretation of the Loan Contract which included Mohammerah among the ports on which Russia had a lien. At a later interview, on the 5th April, Mr. Spring-Rice was told by the Foreign Minister that the expression in the Russian Loan Contract was—“ except Ears and the Gulf bf Fars,” and he was assured that “not only in Mohammerah, “ but in every part of Persia where British interests “ are concerned, the Persian Government, before taking any steps of importance, would consult “ the British Government.” Mr. Spring-Rice was then instructed that he need not recur for the moment to the matter of the Mohammerah customs unless any fresh incident should arise. 6 . The money supplied to Persia through the Russian Government was very soon exhausted, and before the end ol the year (1900) there wererumours of other loans. At the beginning of 1901 Mr. Spring-Rice wrote that the Imperial Bank of Persia might be asked for an advance of 200,000Z. on their current account with the Persian Govern ment—an advance which “ would not be a loan “ within the meaning of the clause in the Russian “ Loan Agreement.” The Bushire customs, he remarked, were bringing in about 1,400L a week 0 , but he had suggested to the Bank to demand the Mohammerah customs as an additional guarantee, to solve the question raised at the time of the Russian contract. On the 14th March Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed from Teheran that the loan had been applied for from the Bank, repayable by 36 monthly instalments, the security being a preferential claim upon the southern customs. The arrangement was carried through in April, and an additional 20 , 000 ?. was lent a little later, making 220,000?. in all. The rate of interest was 12 per cent. The Imperial Bank, it may be explained, are not allowed by the terms of their concession to lend to the Persian Government beyond the limit of one-third of their paid-up capital of 650,000?., Le., 216,666?.

Still, the Persian Government continued in sore straits for money. They were willing to borrow from the British Government, and they were known also to be endeavouring to obtain a further loan from Russia. On the 28th October 1901 Lord Lansdowne telegraphed to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg (Mr. C. Hardinge) to draw the attention of the Russian Government to the fact that any arrangement under which Persia would pass under the financial tutelage of either Power would be incompatible with the maintenance of the independence of the country, recognised by under standings arrived at in 1834 and 1888. A French paraphrase of this telegram was furnished to the Russian Foreign Minister, Count Lamsdorff, on the following day, its concluding words being as follows :— * ‘‘ UAngletcrre a toujours reconnu les interets prependerants de la Bussie dans le novd de la Perse. Dans le sud, an contraire, et surtout aux ports du Golfe Pcrsan, aidant qiicn Seistan, la Grande- Bretacjne a des interets qiiclle ne pent laisser ignorer. “ Le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste est toid pret a discutcr avec le Gouvernement Imperial, de la jaqon la plus amicale, la possibilite d'un arrangement par lequel des avances d'argent pourraient simultanement se faire a la Perse par Ventremise des deux Puissances, qui accepteraient respectivement comme garantie les revenus Persans leves dans les spheres susmentionnees.' Count Lamsdorff in reply informed Mr. C. Hardinge that he had learnt from M. de Witte that, contrary to what he had told Mr. Hardinge before, the Russian Bank had been in negotiation with the Persian Government for another loan, and that a small advance had in fact been already granted. He declared himself as most anxious to “ Financial tutelage.” Telegram to Mr. C. Hardiuge, No. 173, 28th October 1901. (P. 56.) \ Mr. C. Hardinge’s Despatch] No. 304, dated 30th October 1901.

The advance of the money was to be subject to certain conditions, which included, together with stipula tions as to the tariff, Seistan, &amp;c., security for the Joan on the “ revenue of the customs of the ports of the southern littoral of Persia, including Moham- merah,” and a provision that the loan should not be repayable (unless by consent) within a period of ten years.

(P. 52.) ^ 9. The offer of this advance was made to the Persian Grand Vizier, but the question was raised by him whether its acceptance would not conflict with the Russian Loan Contract of 1900. Sir A. Hardinge explained that he understood that agree ment to prohibit a foreign loan in the sense of the sale of Persian securities on the open market, but not such an arrangement as was proposed by His Majesty s Government. The Persian Government still felt themselves, however, unable to accept the British oiler, and the Grand Vizier informed Sir A. Hardinge on the 28th November 1901 that M. de Witte had refused to allow the Persian Government to accept a British advance, while practically agreeing himself to grant an advance of 1 , 000 , 0001 . On the Gth^ January 1902 Lord Lansdowne addressed to Sir A. Hardinge a comprehensive Despatch, of which a copy was subsequently furnished to the Shali,^ on the political and financial situation in Persia, and on the 8 th February 1902 he instructed the British Ambassador at St. Peters burg, Sir C. Scott, to enquire of the Russian Government the grounds of their objection to the British advance to Persia. Reply of Russian Government as to non-acceptance by Persia of British advance. Sir C. Scott's Telegram No. 17, 28tb February 1902. (P. 106.) Telegram to Sir C. Scott, No. 23, 7th March 1902. (P. 126.) 10. At the request of Count Lamsdorff Sir C. Scott supplied him with a pro-memorid drawn up in accordance with Lord Lansdowne’s instructions, and the Russian reply was received on the 28th February 1902. The reply was tantamount to a refusal by the Russian Government to consent to the British advance, on the ground that the security assigned for the loan of 1900 had been represented by the Banque des Prets as insufficient. Further oral explanations, of no satisfactory character,6 were given to Sir C. Scott on the 5th March, and on the 10th March he forwarded to Count LamsdorfT, in a private letter, a memorandum making further inquiries in the matter. 11 . Meanwhile the negotiations had been pro ceeding for a fresh Russian loan, and by the beginning of 1902 they had been greatly advanced by the withdrawal of Russian demands ( 1 ) for a concession for a pipe-line across Persia from the Baku oil-wells to Bushire, and ( 2 ) for the repay ment by the Persian Government of the sum already borrowed from the Imperial Bank of Persia (see paragraph 6 ). Finally, on the 9th April 1902, an official announcement appeared in the Official Messenger at St. Petersburg of a new 5 per cent, loan of 10,000,000 roubles (roughly 1 , 000 , 000 L) ‘ sous garantie des memes recettes “ douanieres qui servent de garantie a Vemprunt “ de 1900 et aux memes conditions que pour cet “ emprunt.” It was not until the 30th November 1902 that a copy of this Loan Contract was sent home by Sir A. Hardinge. Its provisions were almost identical with those of the Contract of 1900, but by the insertion of an additional clause the Persian Government was prohibited, not only from “issuing” (emettre), but also from “contracting” (contracter), without the consent of Russia, any foreign loan “ d longue echeance.' The loan was redeemable in 75 years, and, since it could only be paid off “d partir du \er Janvier 1912,” with six months’ notice, the “ financial tutelage ” of the country was prolonged for two years longer, a contingency against which the Grand Vizier had been specially warned in a note from Sir A. Hardinge dated the 28th March 1902. Sir C. Scott’s Despatch No. 76, 6 th March 1902. (P. 130). Sir C. Scott's Despatch No. 81, 14th March 1902. (P. 216.)

Hardinge’s Despatch No. 83, 11th May 1902. (P. 183). “ I am, of course, aware that the customs of a large part of Southern Persia, viz., Pars and the ports on the Persian Gulf, are explicitly excluded from the securities assigned for the second, as well as for the first, Russian loan, and that there is happily no immediate prospect that this security will prove insufficient for the service of both loans. /\t the same time it must be remembered that Fars and the Gulf ports are only a portion of ‘Southern Persia ’; that the amount of Persia’s total debt to Russia has just been increased by 1,000,0()0Z. ; and that the conditions of the first, and presumably of the second, loan provide, in case of default, for the control and supervision of the customs so pledged by the Russian Bank, with no saving clause as regards those parts of ‘ Southern Persia ’ not included in the term Fars and the ports of the 4 Persian Gulf.’ Th 5c x iv* fyu/'L . ■ ' - cU'.- -i 3 d'df ^6 j/ 1 * ?r r 4‘ n n? ardmge 8 Tele g ra m No. 60, 1st May 1903.

I here was difficulty in making a direct loan in view of the engagements of Persia with Russia as to future borrowing, and in the final result it was agreed to advance to the Persian Government, through the agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia , Q s ' m not exceeding 300,0001. On the 8 th April 190o an agreement (Appendix III.) was signed at II hr an tor an advance through the Bank of 200 0001. at the rate of o per cent, interest per annum.’ The i ersian Government engaged to repay the advance capital and interest, in 20 years out of the proceeds 0 the royalties of the Caspian fisheries (Ap- pendix II.) ; if these were insufficient, out of the revenues of the postsf and telegraphs (para. 4 9 ) and m the last resort, out of the revenues of the customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf. Sir A. Hardinge at the same time reported that m ^ opinion of the Bank Manager the absence of any clause allowing anticipations was sufficient practical safeguard against repayment before the end of 10 years, and he added that later on the repayments might be transformed into a terminable annuity. .. 200 ’ 0003 - ''as paid to the Bank by the India Office on the 11 th April 1903. 14. The terms in which the Imperial Bank of 1 ersia were to be remunerated for their share in t le transaction are shown m the following extract of a letter addressed to the Bank by the Foreign Office on the 7th April 1903 :— I am to inform you that, in the event of a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at, the sum of 200,0002. will be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Secretary of State for India for the purpose of being advanced to the Persian Govern ment, the Bank being the nominal lender, and charging the Persian Government interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, of which 4 per c.mt8 will be remitted to the Secretary of State for India, the remaining 1 per cent, being retained by the Bank as a commission for its services in the matter. Any sums received in payment of the capital advance will be paid over at once to the Secretary of State for India without deduction.” 15. It was decided that the amount of the advance of 200 , 000 b should be entered in the Monthly Statements, to be sent to India, of “Receipts “ and Disbursements of the Home Treasury of “ the Government of India,” under the heading “Advances Repayable,” and, later, that the same heading should be adopted in the case of various published statements of the Indian Accounts. Manner of entry of the advance in Accounts of the Government of India. Pol. 2410/03. Pol. 3310/03. 4 16. The Government of India were far from being satisfied with the arrangements made with the Persian Government in the matter of the advance, and in a telegram dated the 7 th May 1903 they observed as follows :— “ Through the whole correspondence we have pressed for the southern customs as first security. It now appears that customs rank only as third security and are confined to customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf, a phrase that we thought extremely ambiguous.” 17. As a result Sir A. Hardinge gave explana tions in a long Despatch as to the exact financial situation in Persia, discussing the meaning of the ambiguous expression “ customs of Southern Persia,” as used in the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note of the 23rd October 1897 (see paragraph 4), as well as of the expression “Pars and the Persian Gulf.” Did “ Southern Persia ” mean “ Southern ” as distinct from “Northern,” or “Southern” as distinct from “ Central” as well as “Northern ” ? And was Mohammerah a “ Port of the Persian Gulf,” being 60 miles up the Shatt-el-Arab ? On these and other points much further correspondence passed, until on the 8 th March 1904 a compre hensive memorandum was addressed to the Ain-ed- Dowleh embodying previous notes on the disputed points and calling attention to the fact that in a “ Reglement Douanier ” of the Persian Government no mention whatever was made of the customs of “Pars and the Persian Gulf” or the customs of “Southern Persia.” “The latter”—so ran the memorandum—“ are grouped into three districts, “called respectively ‘Arabistan,’ ‘The South,’ “ and ‘ Baluchistan,’ and before authorising me to “ accept the Customs Regulations in the manner “ provided by the Convention of 1903, His Majesty’s “ Government desire me to come to some clear “ understanding with the Persian Government as “ to the exclusion of all these three districts, which, “ whether covered or not at the time by the term “ ‘Pars and the Gulf of Pars are undoubtedly “ covered by the term ‘ Southern Persia ’ used in Attitude of the Government of India in the matter of the advance.

Their reply was, in its nature, a compromise, but it contained the important admission that, m excluding the customs of Fars and the Gulf of Fars from the guarantee for the Russian loans of 1900 and 1902, “ the intention of u * 10 ^ ersi an Government was, without doubt, to preserve m freedom all its full rights of possession over all the ports of the south.” The repiv was a compromise in that it referred to the impossi bility ot interpreting the loan contracts “ without the participation of the Russian Bank,” and suggested that the question of Mohammerah might ultimately have to be referred to arbitration.

His Majesty’s Government did not consider the terms of the Persian reply to be satisfactory, and on their instructions Sir A. Hardinge presented a note to the Foreign Minister, dated the 30th August 1904, winch contained the following words:— ® Sir A. Hardinge’s Despatch No. 22, 30th August 1904. (P. 212.) Pol. 3316/04. . “ ^ order &gt; however, to avoid any possibility of misunderstanding, I am instructed to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Govern- hold them to their engagement of October IbJi. J his engagement is anterior to the Russian loan agreements, and cannot be affected by anv of their provisions. . ^ a t the same time, to slate that, as it was admittedly intended by the British and Persian Governments that the term ‘ Fars and the Persian Gulf should include all the customs of Southern Persia referred to in the engagement of 1897, His Majesty’s Government cannot admit a solitary exception in the case of Mohammerah and its dependencies, or of any of the ports of Arabistan, and I am to add that His Majesty’s Government will take the necessary steps to insure respect ioi theii rights in the event of any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to ignore them.” The omission of the last sentence was after wards asked for bv the Mushir-ed-Dowleh but the the request was not followed up. In signing the i eisian Reglement Douamer ” Sir A. Hardinge made a formal reservation, dated the 29th August 1904, to guard against the ex pression “ douanes du Sud ” as therein used, being supposed to be synonymous with the’ same expression as employed in the Persian under taking of the 23rd October 1897 (see paragraph 4 .) Second Anglo-Indian advance to the Persian Government (£100,000). — 0 . (hi the 1 st September 1904 an agreement (Appendix IV.), was signed for the advance to the Persian Government—through the Imperial Bank, as on the last occasion—of a further sum of 100,000k The securities for the advance remainedas they were before, but the amount of the loan was combined with the sum of 190,000Z. still remaining unpaid out of the previous advance,* and the total amount of 290,000Z. was to be repaid in 20 years by equal annual instalments of principal and interest combined, amounting to 23,270L 7s., the first instalment falling due on the 4th April 1905. It was also agreed that this scheme of repayment should only be capable of modification by consent of both parties. The amortization scheme for the loan, is shown in the Table printed as Appendix V. The figure for the annuity (23,2701. 7s.), was taken from Violene’s Tables, and was checked by the Bank in London. The sum of 10O,0O0Z. was paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the India Office on the 7th September 1904. 21. The Imperial Bank of Persia had pre viously been addressed by the Foreign Office in a letter dated the 30th August 1904, in the following terms :— “ I am to inform you that, in the event of a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at, the sum of 100,0007. will be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Secretary of State for India, for the purpose of being advanced to the Persian Govern ment, the Bank being the nominal lender, charging the Persian Government interest at the rate of 5 per cent., of which 4 per cent, will be remitted to the Secretary of State for India, and retaining a commission of 1 per cent., as in the case of last year's loan.” 22. In the spring of 1905 fresh efforts were made by the Persian Government to obtain money.t The idea was conceived of asking the Imperial Bank of Persia, which had already lent rather more than the terms of its concession allowed (Appendix L), for a sum of 150,0007. as a discount on, or redemption of, the annual roy?dty of 4,0007. which the Bank had to pay to the Shah. The plan fell through, on account of legal difficulties, and a sum of 80,0007., obtained from the Russian Government, repayable in four years at 12 per cent., was merely a temporary palliative. The assistance of His Majesty’s Government was invoked, and the Secretary of State in Council expressed his readi ness to provide from Indian revenues a further sum of 150,0007., “subject to the understanding “ that His Majesty’s Government guarantee the “ Government of India against loss on the trans- “ action, both as regards principal and interest, to “ the extent of one-half of the amount involved.” A memorandum was accordingly communicated to the Persian Minister in London, dated the 13th July 1905, which called attention to an earlier British offer of an advance of 100,0007., abandoned through the refusal of the Persian Government to entrust the Karim irrigation project to agents * On 30th March 1904 the India Office were paid 18,000Z. by the Bank of Persia, of which 10 , 000 Z. was treated as repayment of capital, and 8 , 000 /. as interest.

Hardinge’s note to the Mushir-ed- Dowleh of the 30th August 1904; and ( 2 ) that railway construction in South Persia (including Seistan) shall, in so far as foreign assistance is required, only be carried out with the consent of His Majesty’s Government.” To Mr. Grant Duff, No. 143, 4th Octo ber 1905.

In the result it was decided not to make a loan, the telegram sent to the Viceroy containing the following words :— “ It appears to His Majesty’s Government that in the present condition of Persia loan would be of no permanent benefit to her and would be granted solely for purpose of obtaining concessions of doubtful eventual value either in themselves or as means of resisting Russian influence in Southern Persia. It is true that application for loan will pretty certainly be made in another quarter. But we have strong reasons for feeling assured that, for an indefinite time at any rate, that application will be refused.” Co-operation with the Russian Government.

On the 5th February 1906 Mr. Spring- Rice addressed a private letter to Count Lamsdorff, informing him of the rejection by the British Government of the Persian request for a loan, andexplaining that His Majesty’s Government would expect reciprocity on the part of the Russian Government if a similar application should be made to them. The letter concluded with the following words :— “ Si, toutefois, pour quelque raison, le Gouverne- ment Imperial le croit desirable de preter un appui financier ii la Perse et quil vent bien considerer la question de concert avec le Gouvernement Britan- nique, je suis charge d'assurer votre Excellence que Sir Edward Grey est tout pret d entrer en discussion d ce sujet dans un esprit de conciliation.” On the 7th February Count Lamsdorff informed Mr. Spring-Rice orally that the Emperor had expressed his satisfaction at this communication. He added that he was himself quite of opinion that an end should be put to the practice under which the Persian Government was able to obtain money from the English or the Russian Govern ment by playing off one against the other. 25. Correspondence passed about the same time between the Foreign Office and the Imperial Bank of Persia* regarding certain cheques of the Persian Government which the Bank had practi cally been obliged to honour, although by so doing it had raised the amount of the indebtedness to itself of the Persian Government to more than 100,000h beyond the limits of the Bank’s concession. (Appendix L). The question was asked whether the Bank should accept drafts on the Southern Customs, payable in instalments, in lieu of immediate repay ment of the Persian overdraft. The Foreign Office declined the responsibility of advising the Bank, but gave a general assurance of diplomatic support at Tehran.

In 1905 the Persian Government punctually paid their first instalment in respect of the British advances of 1903 and 1904, the amount received by the India Office on the 5th April being 18,660h 15s. 2d. On the 14th April 1906 a sum of 5,500Z. was received by the India Office, of which 2,17bh 10 . 9 . 9d. was treated as repayment of principal, and 3,323Z. 9s. 3d. as interest. On the 22nd June 1906 a further sum was received of 15,106Z. 4s. lOd. Of this 7,032L 6 s. 8 d. was treated as principal, 7,925L 14s. 5d. as interest, and 148h 3s. 9d. as interest on the overdue instal ment, thus completing the payment due on the 4th April 1906. {See Appendix IX.,) 27. Meanwhile a new development had taken place through the illness of the Shah, and the necessity of advancing money to the Valiahd in conjunction with Russia, to secure a peaceable suc cession. To meet the situation the Secretary of State consented to advance from Indian revenues through the Imperial Bank a sum not exceeding 50,000h, on substantially the same conditions as governed the advances already made; the British Exchequer becoming responsible for the half of Payments by Persian Government on account of the 1903 04 advances.

Sir A. Nicolson's Despatch No. 628, 17th September 1906. (P. 38.) -S. On the 31st August 1906, an important conversation took place at St. Petersburg between Six A. Nicolson and M. Isvolsky, regarding the intention of the Persian Government to apply to Germany for financial assistance in default of aid from Great Britain or Russia. In the course of this conversation M. Isvolsky stated that he wished to act in harmony with the “tacit agreement” arrived at with Sir C. Spring-Rice (para. 24), and to consult with His Majesty’s Government as to the best means of affording relief to Persia. Communications followed between the Foreign Office and Tehran, and in the result an aide- me moire was sent to M. Isvolsky by Sir A. Nicolson on the 14th September 1906, proposing a joint Anglo-Russian advance of 400,000b, or 200,000b by each Power. The aide-memoire contained the following passage :—“ Le Gouvernement Britannique ^ 'pi opose de prendre comme garanties pour sa part “ de Vavance : ( 1 ) Une hypotheque, outre celle quil possede deja, sur les douanes des porta dans le midi de la 1 erse et dans le Golfe Persique ,‘ et (2) de recevoir du Gouvernement Persan un en- ( gagement qu aucune concession pour chemins de “ fer, routes, on telegraphes, ne soit accordee d d autres Puissances a l est d une hgne trance de “ Birjand a Bunder Abbas. M. Isvolsky was averse to considering, in connection with the advance, the important question involved in the second of these conditions, but he informed Sir A. Nicolson on the 17th September 1906 that he saw no objection to the British Government taking as its security the customs in the south of Persia and in the Gulf. Approval of Contracts for Anglo- Russian advance (£400,000. G., £200,000 by each Government, of which half to be paid at once). The Customs Security. Sir C.

After some further correspondence the text was approved of identic Loan Conventions to be executed by the British and Russian Banks with the Persian Government, stating that an advance of 400,000b would be made to the Persian Govern ment. of which 200 , 000 b would be paid at once, in equal shares, by the two Governments. Interest was to be at the rate of 7 per cent., and the Russian and British Governments could demand repayment a year after signature of the contracts, on giving- three months’ notice. The Russian advance was guaranteed by the revenues of the customs already “ affected to the guarantee of the two loans con- “ eluded in 1900 and 1902,” and the English advance “ by the revenues of the administrations “ of posts and telegraphs, and, in case of insuf- “ ficiency, the revenues of the customs of Ears and “the Persian Gulf.” Sir C. Spring-Rice's Telegram No. 305, As regards the expression “ customs of Fars 24th October 1906. and the Persian Gulf,” the text of a note was ( p - 84 -) approved by the Foreign Office to remind the11 Persian Government that “ His Majesty’s Govern- “ ment hold to the interpretation already laid down “ in the note of the 30th August 1901 from this “ Legation ” (paragraph 19). The clause defining the British guarantee differed, it may be remarked, from that of previous loan contracts in its omission of the Caspian Fisheries” (Appendix 1L). The omission was accepted by Sir C. Spring-Pace at the instance of his Russian colleague at Tehran, in view of the fact that no revenues were being derived from the fisheries. The course of the negotiations is described in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s Despatch No. 280, dated the 9th November 190C, but Sir A. Nicolson in a sub sequent Despatch, No. 773, of the 20th November 1906, corrected Sir C. Spring-Rice’s impression that M. Isvolsky had accepted merely in a personal capacity the guarantee asked for in His^MHje:?t\ s Ambassador’s aide-memoivc of the 14th Septembi r 1906,of “ les douancs des ports dans le midi de la Perse et dans le Golfe Persiqne. -n ri In telegraphing to Sir C.

On this occasion the Treasury consented to advance from British revenues their moiety (50,000k) of the first instalment of 100 , 000 k due from the British and Indian Governments. A sum of 50,()00k was paid to the Imperial Bank by the India Office on the 4 th October 1906. The constitution, how ever, in this year of the Persian National Assembly brought a new force into play, and owing to its opposition the money was not drawn by the I eisian Government.

Pol. 3538/06. 31. x\bout this time there were renewed reports of the Shah’s ill-health, and the question again became pressing of making an immediate advance to the Valiahd of 50,000k (paragraph 27). The India Office agreed to hold the money in readiness, but concluded their letter to the Foreign Office with the following words :— “ Lord Morley would, however, suggest for Sir E. Grey’s serious consideration, that the precedent of the financial arrangements of the joint loan with Russia now being made to the Persian Government should be followed in case of this loan to the Yaliahd, and that the Imperial Government should provide half the capital sum involved, instead of guaranteeing Indian revenues against loss in respect of a moiety of the advance.” The Treasury did not fall in with this proposal, but guaranteed the interest and capital of one moiety (25,000k) of the advance from Indian revenues. The sum of 50,000k was paid by this Office to the Bank of Persia on the 14th December 1906. Advance for the Valiahd from Indian revenues (£50,000).

Spring-Rice reported that the Persian Government would be unable to pay the annuity due the following month m respect of the Anglo-Indian advance of 290,0002 V ith the concurrence of the India Office he was authorised to agree to a delay of six months in the payment of interest, on condition that a clause should be eliminated from the charter of the new National Bank granting it priority in the importation and sale of silver. Later, in reply to a formal request from the Persian Government, a note was addressed to them on the 31st August 1907 bv Sir C. Spring- Rice, stating that His Majesty’s Government con sented to a delay of three years, during which “ nothing should be paid on account of the sinking ;; fund, hut only interest, in order that the Persian “ Representatives might have time to carry on the ^ neeessaiy reforms and to put the income and “ expenditure of the country on a proper footing.” llnec conditions i\ere attached to this concession i ( 1 ) that the Persian Government “ would not “ contract any new foreign loan without giving their “creditors, England and Russia, the option of “ advancing money on the same conditions ( 2 ) that they should not grant to anyone the monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint, and that, in the matter of the importation of silver,1C “ all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, will “ be treated equall 3 T , and without distinction and (3) that, if reforms were not carried out, “ His “ Majesty’s Government should have the right to '* demand payment of the arrears of sinking fund “ at any time within the next three years.” 34. The Anglo-Russian Convention was signed on the 31st August 1907. Article V. of the “ Arrangement concerning Persia ” related to the question of Persian indebtedness, and its wording was as follows : — “ In the event of irregularities occurring in the amortization or the payment of the interest of the Persian loans concluded with the ‘ Banque ‘ d’Escompte et des Prets de Perse ’ and with the Imperial Bank of Persia up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement, and in the event of the necessity arising for Russia to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the first-named bank, and situated in the region men tioned in Article II. of the present Arrangement, or for Great Britain to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the second-named bank, and situated in the region mentioned in Article I. of the present Arrangement, the British and Russian Governments undertake to enter beforehand into a friendly exchange of ideas with a view to determine, in agreement with each other, the measures of control in question, and to avoid all interference which would not be in confor mity with the principles governing the present Arrangement.” 35. Prior to the signing of the Anglo-Russian Convention, it was reported by Sir C. Spring-Rice, on the 8 th July 1907, that payment in full had been made of the Russian coupon, and that the Director at Tehran of the Imperial Bank of Persia had stated that this had been in part effected by making payments from the revenue of the Southern Customs. Sir C. Spring-Rice explained later, that the receipts of the northern Customs had fallen short by 4 , 000 L of the interest due the previous week on the Russian loan, and that the amount had been made good from the Bushire receipts. On the British loan nothing had been paid, nor was likely to be paid, while the Bushire receipts, say, 85,000L per annum, were being diverted to other objects. He added that the Imperial Bank of Persia were obtaining their own payments (or rather a portion of them) from the receipts of Kerman shah. On instructions from His Majesty’s Govern ment, Mr. Marling, who was now Charge d’Affaires, addressed a note to the Persian Government on the 15th October 1907, in which he enquired “ what “ satisfactory reasons the Persian Government can “ adduce for diverting to other purposes revenues Anerlo-Russian Convention of 31st August 1907.

About this time the Treasury raised the question whether Parliament should not be in formed of the liability of the British Exchequer in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of the years 1903 and 1904 (290,000b), and the Foreign Office, in addressing the India Office, expressed the opinion that, “ in view of the conclusion of the Anglo- Russian Agreement, there is no longer any “ reason, from the point of view of foreign policy, “ for keeping secret the details of the loan.” The India Office replied that the Secretary of State was ” not aware of any circumstances that would “ render it inadvisable now to bring to the notice “ of Parliament the action which His Majesty’s “ Government have taken in this matter,” and the Foreign Office informed the Treasury, on the 21st February 1908, that Sir E. Grey saw no objection to bringing the matter to the notice of Parliament. They asked for “ the views of the “ Lords Commissioners as to the manner in which “ the communication should be made,” and ex pressed the opinion that, “ in view of the absence “ of any papers which could conveniently be laid “ on the subject, any explanation given should “ take the form of a Statement, and that such “ Statement should set forth the reasons which “ have hitherto rendered inexpedient the publica- “ tion of the details of this transaction.” 37. In addressing the Foreign Office on the 11 th February 1908 the India Office took occasion to invite them “ to agree to a simple procedure by which might be regulated ” the adjustment between the British and Indian Exchequers of any liabilities in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903 and 1904. A memorandum (Appendix VI.) suggesting the keeping of an “ Arrears Account ” by the Accountant-General at the India Office was enclosed in the letter, and a copy was forwarded to the Treasury by the Foreign Office in their letter of the 21st February 1908, with the remark that, under the terms of the memorandum no claim would be made against British funds “ in respect “ of temporary and comparatively trifling losses “ such as that occasioned by the delay of six “ months in the payment of interest which was “ granted to the Persian Government in April “ last.” (See paragraphs 54 and 58.) 38. In the meantime, towards the middle of February, Mr. Marling had addressed a note to the Mushir-ed-I)owleh reminding him that “ neither “ has the interest on the British loan of 1903-04, “ due on the 4th April 1907, been paid, nor has any s. 19. E18 “ reply been given to the conditions formulated in “ Sir C. Spring-Rice’s note of the 81st August 1907,' :: 'which hlis Majesty’s Government attached * See paragraph 33 . “ to their assent to the request of the Persian Government for the suspension for three years “ of the sinking fund on that loan .... Unless that interest is paid forthwith, and a “ formal acceptance of the conditions above al luded to given to the Legation without delay, “ His Majesty’s Government will demand the im- “ mediate payment of the full amount of the “ annuity instead of the interest only.” On the 18th of the same month (February) Mr. Marling telegraphed that the Persian Govern ment had paid 13,000/. as interest on the Anglo- Indian loan, and on the 13th March the India Office informed the Foreign Office that “ the following “ amounts have been placed to the account of the “ Secretary of State for India at the Bank of “ England, in respect of interest on the advance “ made to the Persian Government :— Mr. Marling’s Telegram No. 47, 18th February 1908.

The Legation’s note of the 31st August 1907 (paragraph 33), as to the suspension of the sinking fund, was still, however, unanswered, and no payment had been made by the Persian Govern ment of the amount overdue for sinking fund since the 4th April 1907. In a note dated the 24th February 1908, Mr. Marling reminded the Persian Government of these facts, and added the following words :—“ His Britannic Majesty’s Government “ consider that, by failing to effect any payment, “ and notwithstanding the repeated verbal repre- “ sentations which I have had the honour to make “ on the subject, and by neglecting to give any reply “ to Sir Spring Rice’s above-mentioned note, the “ Persian Government have tacitly accepted the “ conditions set forth therein.” Intimation to Persian Government as to their tacit acceptance of con ditions in British Note as to sinking fund.

Finally, on the 25th July 1908, after the occurrence in the 23rd June of the coitp d'etat by which the Shah reverted to despotic Government, Mr. Marling addressed a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that “His Majesty’s “ Government can no longer admit of aii 3 r dis- “ cussion of the terms laid down in Sir C. “ Spring-Rice’s note ” (paragraph 33).

On the 5th September 1908 the India Office enquired of the Foreign Office whether any decision had yet been arrived at upon the proposal made by the Foreign Office to the Treasury as to an expla natory statement to Parliament regarding the Anglo-Indian loan (paragraph 36). Copy of the letter was forwarded by the Foreign Office to the Treasury on the 12th idem. 41. A few months previously a telegram had appeared in the Berliner Tageblatt that the Shah had promised to pay an annual subsidy of 2,500L to the German School at Tehran, to be guaranteed by a lien on the Customs revenue. It was ascertained by Mr. Marling that payment of the subsidy was, in fact, to be made from the Customs funds, and correspondence passed with the Russian Govern ment as to a protest to the Persian Government. In the result, His Majesty’s Government decided to act alone, and a note was addressed on the 11 th January 1909 to the Persian Government by Sir G. Barclay, who had now become Minister at Tehran, reminding them that the interest on the British loan of 1903 and 1904 was in arrear since the preceding April, and adding that “ if the resources “ of the Persian Government are pledged without “ the consent of His Majesty’s Government so as “ to imperil the security of the British loans and “ advances . . . . or to diminish the several “ revenues assigned to the service of their interest “ or sinking fund, His Majesty’s Government will “ be compelled to consider what steps are necessary “ for safe-guarding their interests.” 42. On the 2nd February 1909 the Foreign Office addressed the India Office on the question of the service of the Anglo-Indian loan :—“ Sir E. “ Grey is disposed to think that the collection of “ the Gulf customs by or on behalf of His Majesty’s ‘ l Government, which a demand for repayment “ would probably entail, would be inopportune at “ the present moment, and might be regarded as “ interference in the affairs of Persia, which it “ would be advisable to avoid as long as possible. “ He would be glad to know whether it would “ be feasible to impound, by the agency of the “ Indo-European Telegraph Department, the pro- “ ceeds of the telegraph revenues, on which the “ advances are partially secured, should his Lord- “ ship agree that the collection of the customs “ should not be resorted to for the present.” In reply the Secretary of State for India ex pressed concurrence in the view that the collection of the customs would be inopportune, and stated that he was “ of opinion that it would be better nat to press the demand for payment in a definite “ form till the question of the constitutional and “ financial regime to be established in Persia has “ further developed.” A note was transmitted of the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Tele graph Department, explaining that some 3,500Z.only could in any case be realised by impounding the telegraph revenues, and deprecating such action as likely to disturb existing relations between his own and the Persian Telegraph Departments. 43. Mention may here be made of a complaint by the Russian Government in the spring of 1908 that the Imperial Bank of Persia had sequestered the customs revenues of Kermanshah (in the Russian sphere) as a guarantee for sums due to the Bank from the Persian Government ; it was pointed out that those revenues were part of the security for Russian loans. The Foreign Office ascertained that the action of the Bank had been based on a verbal arrange ment with the Persian Customs Administration, and, the Russian representations being held to be well- founded, a plan was proposed for transferring the lien acquired by the Bank from the customs receipts of Kermanshah to those of Bushire. A note with this object was addressed to the Persian Government on the 4th November 1908, and, in the end, the Persian Government undertook to pay from the receipts of the Bushire customs, as interest on the Bank’s debts, the sum of 30,000 tomans a month (72,000L a year) with effect from the 21 st March 1909 (the beginning of the Persian financial year). The Bank’s debts, it may be remarked, amounted in all at this time to 52G,000L (leaving out of account the Anglo-Indian loan), or about 310,000L in excess of the amount authorised by their concession. Nearly half the debt was on account of their advance of 200,000L in 1901 (see paragraph 6 ), secured on the customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf.

Subsequent!} 7 , on the falling off of the Bushire customs receipts, the receipts of the Mohamerah customs were also assigned, with the concurrence of the India Office, to the service of the Bank’s own loans. Sir G. Barclay had explained that the receipts at Ahwaz, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas should amply suffice for the service of the Anglo-Indian loan. 45. In giving their assent to the arrangement described in the preceding paragraph, the Treasury raised the question whether the Persian Govern ment should not be pressed for a further payment in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan. The Foreign Office considered that such action would be useless in the financial condition of Persia, but that “ the question must be considered when Persian finances “ are set in order, or if a further loan to the “ Persian Government is eventually guaranteed or &lt;£ made.” 46. The extent of the Persian Government’s indebtedness at this time had been disclosed in the report of M. Bizot, their French Financial Adviser, dated the 15th March 1909, of which the main Additional lien of Bank on Mo hamerah Customs. Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 15th September 1909.

Bizot’s opinion, the need for a loan is indisputable, though he is unable to pronounce as to the amount required. In my telegram No. 152 I gave it as 2,500,000Z, at the lowest estimate, independently of the small advances which would be needed for the reorganization of the Departments which most urgently call for reform, and I should mention that in this estimate I had M. Bizot’s concurrence. Besides the Govern ment’s debt to the two banks, amounting in round figures to some 1 , 200 , 000 Z., which, bearing exorbitant interest, cries loudly for conversion, there are other creditors’ claims which, according to a statement given to M. Bizot, already at the end of 1907-08 amounted to 2,751,638 tomans (550,000L). These must greatly have increased during the year just ended. There are also the claims for postal and road robberies, &amp;c., filed by the foreign Legations, of which it would be rash to attempt an estimate, but which must represent a very considerable sum. “Assuming that the sum indicated above is approximately sufficient to convert the advances of the two banks, and to settle the claims of other creditors and those presented to the Persian Government by the foreign Legations, Persia’s total indebtedness may be estimated at something British and Indian Government’s loan, with arrears of interest - 300,000 Required to pay off floating debt, “ To pay interest on this at 5 or 6 per cent, the customs receipts would amply suffice, leaving a very substantial sum at the disposal of the Persian Government, very nearly as large a sum, indeed, as that now left over after paying the interest on the loans and advances as at present secured on the proceeds of the customs. The conversion of the 1,200,000Z. owed to the Imperial Bank of Persia and to the Russian Bank, so as to reduce the interest from 12 to 6 per cent., would effect a saving of 72,000Z. a year, or nearly enough to pay 6 per cent, on the sum needed to clear off the rest of the floating debt.” of Persia to meet the indebtedness of the country.

There were however certain later charges, e.g., the ex-Shah’s pension, which, in Sir G. Barclay’s opinion, would also have to be borne by the customs, bringing up the total of such charges to 620,000/., or 80,000/. more than the previous year’s net receipts, viz., 540,000/. Sir G. Barclay commented on the position in the following terms :— “ It is quite evident that on the basis of M. Mornard’s statement no further borrowing is possible on the security of the customs, and although only the first four items are fixed charges by virtue of engagements undertaken by the Persian Government, the remaining eleven items being merely chargeable to the customs in accor dance with usage, it would be difficult to relieve the customs of any of these latter. The Russian Government would doubtless object to any other security for the payment of the Cossack brigade, and it is important that the salaries of the European Government officers should be well secured. The rest of the eleven items mostly appertain to the customs administration. “ It is thus evident that a condition precedent for any further borrowing must be the conversion of the advances, &amp;c., of the two banks, and even this would, as I calculate it, only leave sufficient margin for a very trifling loan unless it were found possible to relieve the customs revenue of some of those heads of expenditure with which it has hitherto been charged in accordance with usage. “ The advances of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Russian Bank carry for the most part interest at the rate of 12 per cent, and over. The debt to the two banks amounts, as I understand it, to be tween 8,500,000 tomans (1,700,000Z.)* and 9,000,000 tomans (1,800,000/.), of which I would hazard an estimate that 7,000,000 tomans (1,400,000/.) carry interest at the rate of 12 or 15 per cent. The con version of this debt and the reduction of the interest to 5 per cent, would effect a saving of probably 500,000 tomans (100,000/.), in which case, supposing that the customs receipts do not fall below last year’s level—and for the first six months of this year they show an increase—there would be a margin! f° r borrowing of 100,000 tomans ( 20 , 000 /.).” Negotiations as to financial assist ance for the Persian Government.

Pol. 3268/10. 50. ^Meanwhile the question of giving financial assistance to the Persian Government was con tinuously uuder discussion between the British and Russian Governments. Should both Governments, or one of them, supply the assistance needed, or should both the British and the Russian Banks, or one of them, come to the rescue ? The various stages of the negotiations are set out in a Foreign Office Memo., dated the 26th February 1910, and it is unnecessary here to do more than mention the salient facts. So far as India is concerned, the position in May 1909 is shown in the following24 extract from a telegram addressed to the Viceroy on the 11th May 1909 :— “ His Majesty’s Government are pledged, subject to fulfilment by Shah of conditions imposed, and to safeguards on proper expenditure of funds, to contribute moiety of joint advance by two Govern ments to enable Shah to meet urgent claims, discharge of which is necessary to secure his position on establishment of new regime. Total amount of joint advance is not to exceed 400,000b in all in accordance with agreement with Russian Government described in my telegram of 3 rd October 190o, which has been treated as holding good in principle throughout subsequent phases of negotiations with Russia. Conditions which made that agreement necessary apply with equal force now, and I recognise that India must in the cir cumstances accept financial responsibility for 100.000b, being a moiety of British share of joint advance. Telegram to Viceroy, 11th May 1909. Pol. 412/09. Pol. 3537/06. “ But as regards any further financial assistance to Persia, India is free from any engagement, and I have made it clear to Foreign Office that, apart from objections on grounds of general Imperial policy to financial and other entanglements in Persia, I cannot admit that Indian interests in Persia are of a nature to justify expenditure from Indian revenues on schemes for establishing reformed government in Persia. Such schemes involve not only financial risk but danger of inter national complications, from responsibility for which it is essential that India should be kept entirely free.” On the 16th July 1909 a new era was entered on in Persian politics by the flight of the Shah to the Russian Legation, and his immediate deposition. 51. On the 2nd December 1909 Sir G. Barclay telegraphed that the programme of the Persian Cabinet, including a proposal to apply for an advance of 500,000b, had been submitted to the Medjliss, and he urged that the British and Russian Governments should not be deterred from nego tiating a joint loan by the impossibility of further borrowing on the customs as disclosed in M. Mornard’s statement regarding the “ fixed charges ” (paragraph 49). The Foreign Office concurred in his view as to the desirability of an advance, and, in their letter to the India Office of 7th December 1909 observed that “Sir E. Grey “ attaches great importance to the conversion of the “ debt owed by the Persian Government to the “ Imperial Bank of Persia, and to the Russian “ Discount Bank, which he considers should be a “ necessary condition of any loan.” Proposal of the Persian Government to apply for an advance.

It is true, again, “ that India is part of the Empire, and should take it« share in the burdens of Empire. The moment, “ however, is not a happy one for resort to this line “ of argument, as Indians are now sharply resenting “ a denial to them of equality of citizenship within “ the Empire by colonial communities not them- “ selves contributing to its defence.

But Lord Morley is not con- “ vineed that improvement in the sphere of Indian “ trade by means of this kind is assured enough to “ justify the imposition of new burdens upon the “ general body of Indians.

In the first half of 1910 an arrangement was carried through, to the importance of which allusion has more than once been made (para graphs 40, 49, and 51), viz., the amalgamation of the debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The corre spondence between the Foreign and India Offices' ::: ' was based on telegrams sent home by His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires at I eh run and the local manager of the Imperial Bank, and the text of the agree ment arrived at, together with that of three supplementary letters addressed by the Bank to the Minister of Finance (Appendix VIIL), was received in a despatch from Mr. Marling, dated the Mh June 1910. The general character of the arrangements is, briefly, as follows Exclusive payment is to be made to the Bank, in the first instance, of the full net customs receipts of the Persian Gulf ports, including Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohamerah, and Ahwaz, and from these receipts monthly payments will be made for the service of the Bank’s own debt, and also that of the Anglo-Indian debt, the interest on the former being 7 per cent, in currency, on the latter 5 per cent, in sterling, as before. No pay ments on account of the redemption of capital will be made for three years in respect of the Anglo- Indian debt (314,281Z. IGs. 4d. on the 21st March 1910), but thereafter yearly payments will be made, in respect of both interest' and capital, of 30,278Z. 125.

It was decided by His Majesty’s Government, m the course of the negotiations, not to surrender their lien on the Caspian fisheries (Appendix II.) and on the Posts (paragraph 13) and Telegraphs (paragraph 42).It was also brought forward that the text of the agreement would sufficiently provide against the Persian Government being able to pay off the Government loan except by instalments.

In view of the agreement described in the preceding paragraph, it was arranged with the Foreign Office that it was unnecessary at present for any payment to be made from the British Exchequer to Indian revenues in respect of loss through the non-payment of interest on the Anglo- Indian advance of the years 1903 and 1904. The Treasury undertook, if further default should take place, to ask Parliament to make good the British share of that loss, and, pending such default, they considered that it would be well to defer making any announcement to Parliament on the subject. The India Office agreed that there was no reason for such announcement, “ unless attention is called to the matter. ”' : ‘ The Auditor, it may be remarked, had made in his Report on the India Home Accounts, dated the 2nd May 1910, the following observations “ Interest realised from investment of Cash Balance, &amp;c., 47,23GL 18s.

Up to the time of writing (17th October 1910), there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of the proposed Anglo-Russian advance of 400,0000 being made to the Persian Government. In a Despatch dated the 15th June 1910 it has been explained by Mr. Marling that the Customs revenues could not be regarded as providing adequate security for an advance of that amount. the following is an extract from the Despatch:— “ Souihevn Customs .—The charges on these Prospects of the proposed Anglo- Russian Advance (£400,000).

Hardinge that the Persian Government had decided to raise money by selling for a lump sum the royalties, or rental on the lease, of the Caspian Fisheries. The fisheries had been leased for many years to a Russian merchant of Astrakhan, named Leonozolf, and the latest of the contracts executed was for an extension for five years, from 1920 to 1925, at an increased rental of 20,000b a year. M. Naus estimated that the sale of the royalties for the 22 years should bring in 350,000b In a later Despatch, however, No. 149, dated the 10th August 1904 (P. 33), Sir A. Hardinge wrote as follows :—“ The Caspian Fisheries, which “ have hitherto yielded 20 , 000 b a year, have ceased to be a real guarantee, “ nor would any banker now lend money on their security, since, under the “ new commercial regime as between Persia and Russia, the Russian “ Government can impose, and has intimated its intention of imposing, upon “ Persian fish the duties authorised by the Russian general tariff instead of “ the old 5 per cent, ad valorem duty. . . . For this year, moreover, “ and for the two following years, the fisheries have already been discounted “ to their concessionaire by the Atabeg-i-Azam.” In a Despatch, No. 299, dated the 22nd November 1908 (P. 207), Sir G. Barclay reported that the Persian Government had pledged the Caspian Fisheries Royalties to an Armenian Banking Firm for a further period of three years—1912, 1913, and 1914. Throughout the correspondence it has been recognised that these fisheries afforded merely a nominal security for the Anglo-Indian loan toAPPENDIX VI. (Referred to in paragraph 37.)

The debt due from the Persian Government having been practically converted into an annuity for 20 years, payable on the 4th April in each year from 1905 to 1924 inclusive (viz.: 21,133L 7s. 3d. in 1905 and 23,2701. 7s. in subsequent years), the Accountant-General at the India Office will prepare and keep up an “ Arrears Account ” showing the amount due from the Persian Government in consequence of any failure on its part to pay the instalments of the annuity in full at the right dates. He will debit to this account the amount by which the payment, if any, made by the Persian Government on the 4th April of each year falls short of 23,270Z. 7s., will add once a year interest at the rate of live per cent, per annum on the amount at debit, and will credit to the account any sums received in respect of arrears. He will append to the account a statement showing what portion of the arrears represents money that should have been paid to Indian revenues (with interest thereon) and what portion represents money that should be paid to the Imperial Bank (the amount so payable being one-fifth of all payments that should have been made in respect of the interest portion of the annuity', together with interest at live per cent, thereon added yearly^). Once in three years he will send to the Foreign Office the account and appended statement, and the Foreign Office will pay 7 to the India Office one- half of the amount by which the debt due to Indian revenues has been increased during the preceding three ymars. If the debt has been reduced, he will pay to the Foreign Office one-half of the amount of the reduction. India Office, 24th December 1907. APPENDIX VII. (Referred to in paragraph 49.)

Security which Persian Government propose to offer is same as that given for debt to Imperial Bank of Persia—southern customs. Guarantees other than Persian loans will therefore not suffer.

I* BEG to acknowledge receipt of your favours of the 7th and of the 10th instant. With reference to these I had an interview with Mr. Maxwell on Wednesday last, at which I explained to him— 1. That in pursuance of the suggestion contained in your letter of the 29th August last, addressed to Mr. Wallace, Mr. Preece had been authorised to carry on negotiations for a loan of 100,000L on the security of Persian Government’s interest in the Anglo- Persian Oil Company (Limited), and that these negotiations were on the point of arriving at a conclusion ; and 2. That as the Persian Government’s acquiescence in the erection of our pipe-line telephone, and also in the plying of our barges on the Upper Karun, had been made conditions of this loan, the suggestion contained in your letter of the 7th instant did not at the moment require consideration. At this interview Mr. Maxwell pointed out, with reference to your letter of the 10th instant, that the consent of His Majesty’s Government to this smaller loan could also only be given on conclusion of the negotiations which are now pending for the conversion of the debt due to the Russian Bank. This point had not, I may explain, been clear to Mr. Wallace from the tenor of your letter of the 29th August, which led him to infer that His Majesty’s Government were desirous, in view of the impracticability of carrying through the larger loan because of the objections that existed to the hypothecation of the surplus revenues which were proposed as security, that he should forthwith proceed to endeavour to arrange the loan of 100,000Z. on the security of the Persian Government’s interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited). And, acting on this understanding, he and myself have since been devoting a good deal of time and attention to (1) arranging on this side for the provision of the 100,000L, and (2) settling with the Persian Government, through Mr. Preece, the terms of the loan. These negotiations led to my wiring to Mr. Preece on the 10th instant the following message :— “ Referring to your telegram of the 1st (advising that the Persian Government were now willing to accept a loan at par of 100,0001. at 5 per cent, per annum on security of the oil interests), we agree lend 100,000L at par 5 per cent, on security of Persian Government’s shares and share of profits in Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), on condition that Persian Government consent company using own barges on Upper Karun River, and erecting and using own pipe-line telephone, and also accept compromise tomans arrears proposed by Mr. C. W. Wallace to Imperial Oil Commissioner, viz., halving amount in dispute (i.e., about 3,600L)” To which I received the following reply on the 12th instant:— “ Referring to your telegram of the 10th, conditions (1) and (2) have been accepced by Persian Government. The 2,000 tomans question the Persian Government offer to compromise for 2,000L, to which I have agreed. The loan is agreed to with the proviso that the Persian Government shall have right to repay at any time should they ^ish to increase amount of loan or sell their od interests, but the company to have first refusal (of the larger loan or sale) for sixty days. I declined this, but Persian Govern ment insist upon it. Inform me of your views as quickly as possible. This was the position when I saw Mr. Maxwell last week. At this interview -^r. Maxwell explained the necessity for obtaining the approval of the Russian Government, but I read to him a telegram dispatched by Mr. Preece on the 2Gth ultimo m which he advised that the Russian Minister, who had been interviewed by him or [2931 4]by His Majesty’s Minister on the previous day, whilst deprecating the larger loan for which we had previously been negotiating, did not appear to have any objection to the 100 0001 loan, which telegram seemed to indicate that Mr. Preece was conducting his negotiations with the full knowledge and support of His Majesty s Minister at Tehraf But nevertheless, acting on Mr. Maxwell’s suggestion, I drew Mr. Preece s attention to the point in my telegram authorising acceptance of the conditions set forth m his message of the 12th instant, as follows . ‘‘Referrinff to your telegram of the 12th, we agree all conditions. You can close, but Foreign Office say this small loan must also follow conversion Russian Bank loan. Therefore you must ask British Minister get Russian Minister s approval. Following this I have received from Mr. Preece the further two telegrams quoted below . „ I4 j 1910. “ British Minister seeing Russian Minister to-day and will try to mduce him to ignore Russian Bank objection, although that question ready for prompt settlement. “ October 17, 1910. “ Be prepared to place 2,0001. with Imperial Bank of Persia ready my ordering to this effect To enable me to sign documents please make out power of attorney in favour of myself, and ask Foreign Office if they will telegraph to British Legation a certificate thlt they hold such a document, as was done to enable Sir Charles Hardmge to sign Bakhtiari road agreement for Lynches. The above explanations and telegrams show the position of the negotiations for the loan of 100,0001. at the present moment. In due course I presume His Majes j Minister at Tehran will advise you of the result of his interview with the Russian Minister and in the event of its being favourable, I shall be obliged by your obtaining as soon as possible the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the loan and by your addressing P to my company a letter in accordance with the terms mdicated in yom letter of the 23rd May last addressed to Mr. C.

Shortly after we had presented this note, M. Poklewski received secret information from the Prime Minister to the effect that a project had been mooted for giving Sam-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Public Works, and Vosouk-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Finance, a free hand to negotiate financial arrangements with anyone they chose this intelligence was more particularly disquieting in view of the presence in Tehran M. Seyyid Ruete representative of the Deutsche Bank, and of the recent announcement of the German Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Russian charge d’affaires that, as German financial circles were showing interest in Persia, railway concessions might be granted at any moment. W e had also to think of the negotiations with the International Syndicate, which we knew had not been dropped. We have recently had several experiences of the secrecy with which financial negotiations can be conducted in Tehran, vide those with the International Syndicate and those with the Imperial Bank of Persia relating to the importation of silver for minting purposes and the conversion of the debt, of none of which the two legations had first cognisance from Persian sources. We therefore feared that unless we acted promptly and energetically we might be confronted with a fait accompli.

SARANOWSKY and I to-day called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Moavin-ed-Dowleh), and said we were instructed by the British and Russian Ministers to tell him that, in view of the reports which had reached them concerning certain negotiations said to be actually in progress, we were going on to see the Minister of Public Works (Sani-ed-Dowleh) and the Minister of Finance (Vosouk-ed-Dowleh) to convey a message of warning to them. Moavin-ed-Dowleh, in the course of the conversation which ensued, said that there was a strong divergence of policy among the members of the Cabinet, which made his position a very difficult one. He was opposed to Sani-ed-Dowleh’s policy, and he realised the danger to Persia of the course he was apparently pursuing. He could not understand what advantage was expected from the grant of concessions, whereas he saw many disadvantages. He added, however, that he was officially unaware of any negotiations beside those with the International Syndicate, though he might have heard of them indirectly, just as we had. We then called on Sani-ed-Dowleh, to whom M. Saranowsky read the joint note of the 7th April. He then said that, the British and Russian Ministers having heard that the negotiations with the International Syndicate had throughout been conducted by Sani-ed-Dowleh and the Finance Minister independently of their colleagues, and that, further, secret negotiations were in progress with the object of granting a concession to another party, we had been instructed to say that these reports cause the two Ministers great uneasiness. Our attitude with regard to loans from third parties and as to I concessions had been defined in the note just read to him, and we were instructed to I say that, unless he could give us a definite pledge that such negotiations for arrange- I ments which conflicted with our attitude as defined in the note would not be continued | by him, the two Ministers would be compelled to insist upon his dismissal from office. Sani-ed-Dowleh replied that the two legations would, of course, do exactly as they pleased in regard to demanding his dismissal, but he desired to say, firstly, that the I report that he and the Finance Minister were conducting negotiations behind the I backs of their colleagues was untrue ; and, secondly, though there had been negotia- I tions with the International Syndicate, the particulars of which had been communicated I to the British Legation through Muin-ul-Vizareh, they were not conducted behind the I backs of the rest of the Cabinet Ministers, and, moreover, in no way ran counter to the I stipulations contained in our joint note ; finally, he declared that, as to concessions, I there was no necessity to speak in parables. We were referring to Germany, and he I could tell us that he had not seen M. Ruete, nor had he any idea what that gentleman I desired to obtain. He could tell us positively that no negotiations, so far as he knew, I were in progress as to a concession for a railway from Khanikin to Tehran, and he I added that his personal view was that it would not be in Persia’s interests to grant I railway concessions to any foreigners. If railways were ever built in Persia, the I enterprise should be in Persian hands. We pointed out that, as to the negotiations with the International Syndicate, he I would observe from the second paragraph of the joint note that we laid it down that, I before any new financial engagements were made by the Persian Government, the | floating debts to Great Britain and Russia must first be regularised. We then called on the Minister of the Interior (Sardar Assad), to whom we gave I an account of our mission in the same terms as already stated to the Minister ifr I Foreign Affairs. He told us that it was undoubtedly true that Sani-ed-Dowlefl pursued an independent policy, and we understood that he was not displeased at the | step taken by the two Ministers, as it might bring Sani-ed-Dowleh to reason. He told us that, at a Cabinet Council yesterday, he had proposed that the Minister of Finance | should be given a free hand to conduct negotiations with the object of obtaining 1 loan, but this did not mean that he was actually to conclude them. His intention had Eit accorde nt porter ZIELJ, tl Affairs Ministers ig certain [inister of ►owleh) to that there made his r, and he could not hereas he re of any ght have nt note of leard that ducted by and that, cession to Ministers and as to tructed to r arrange- continued m office, ly as they r, that the the ?gotia- icated id the to the ssions, md he leman knew, md he grant the idicate, he lown that, ment, the been that, when the negotiations were maturing, the project should be put before the Cabinet for submission to the Medjliss. The matter had, however, not been definitely decided. We said we thought such a proposal, if acted upon, would be most dangerous, and we hoped the Cabinet would not give either Sani-ed-Dowleh or Vosouk-ed-Dowleh We proceeded to visit the Finance Minister (Vosouk-ed-Dowleh), to whom we held similar language to that employed with Sani-ed-Dowleh, though the form of the communication was considerably less dry. Though he did not mention the Germans, the Finance Minister gave us a satisfactory reply, much in the sense of that of Sani-ed-Dowleh. He emphatically declared that no negotiations were in progress as to any concessions, and that, if offers had been made from other quarters (as he had stated to me some days before), no notice had been taken of them. Later in the day, after I had given an account of our proceedings to Naser-ul- Mulk, who seemed to consider the steps taken by the two Ministers to have been judicious under the circumstances, M. Saranowsky and I called on the Prime Minister (Sipahdar), to whom we also gave an account of what we had done. We impressed these points upon the Sipahdar that— 1. On no account should the Ministers of Public Works and Finance be given a free hand &gt; and 2. Before concluding anything with the International Syndicate, an arrangement must be come to with Great Britain and Russia as to the floating debts. G. P. CHURCHILL.

Sir, Wn’H reference to my despatch No. -,390 of the ^gnTuTtFrar’andTo' subsequent telegraphic correspondence respecting the proposed loan of 100 , 0001 . by the Imperial Bank to the Persian Government on the security of the Crown jewels, I have the honour to enclose a copy of an aide-memoire of the 16th (29th) September which I received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs defining the attitude of the Russian Government in this matter. 1 he aide-memoire states that the proposed transaction seems to be incompatible with the privileges of the Russian Banque d’Escompte et de Brets, which under article 1 of its concession has “ the exclusive right of making loans on pledges.” Nevertheless, if His Majesty’s Government consider the transaction necessarv on important political grounds the Russian Government, while making full reserves as to the Russian Bank’s exclusive rights, will not oppose it. At the same time the Russian Government cannot but observe that advances of such insignificant amount as that now in contemplation cannot supply a serious remedy to the financial difficulties of Persia, but are caJciliated on the other hand to encourage the Persian Cabinet to persevere in a policy equally detrimental to British and to Russian interests. The aide-memoire further expresses the fear that the proposed loan may have an unfavourable influence on the negotiations actually proceeding between the Persian and the Russian Governments with a view to the consolidation of the debts to the Russian Bank contracted by the Government of the ex-Shah ; and states that it would perhaps be preferable that the loan should be deferred until these negotiations have been completed. Nevertheless, if His Majesty’s Government consider the conclusion of the loan to be a matter of urgency, the Russian Government will not insist on the above consideration. The reply of the Russian Government may, I think, be regarded as the result of a sort of compromise between the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Finance Minister. M. Sazonow was, I believe, considerably impressed by the argument that if the Persian Government were prepared to pledge jewels worth far more than 100,00OL they would certainly be able to borrow that sum, if not from the Imperial Bank, then from another quarter; and he informed me on the 28th ultimo, as I had the honour to report to you by telegraph, that he had written to M. Kokovtsoff recommending that the Russian Government should not raise objections to the proposed loan. The Finance Minister, on the other hand, is anxious for the successful completion of the conversion negotiations. He has, moreover, always been strongly opposed to the policy of small advances to the Persian Government, which he regards as so much money thrown away. He is very much averse to Russia taking part in such advances, and at the same time dislikes, 1 think, the effect on Russian public opinion of their being made from British sources without Russian participation. The present aide-memoire gives clear expression to the Finance Minister’s main objections to the proposed loan, but refrains from insisting upon them if His Majesty’s Government attach real importance to the transaction being carried through. You will observe that the aide-memoire makes no allusion to the article in the Imperial Bank’s concession which binds that bank to hold itself at the disposal of the Persian Government for loans against pledges. I had called the attention of the Russian Government to this article by an aide-memoire of the 13th (26th) ultimo, and on the following day the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me a telegram from M. Poklewsky, expressing the opinion that, in view of the terms of the Imperial Bank’s concession, the exclusive claims advanced by the Russian Bank could not be maintained. I have, &amp;c.

[2931 /c—6][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] I HA\ E the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 8th ultimo addressed to the vice-chairman of my company, and to apologise for the delay in replying thereto, which has been due to the absence of myself and the vice-chairman from town and to the delay in getting replies from the various other persons interested in this matter who are at this time of the year widely scattered. As compared with the suggestion that you were good enough to put forward in your letter to Mr. C. W. Wallace of the 29th August the suggestion referred to in your letter now* under reply is to practically double the amount of the loan without increasing the proposed collateral security. Mr. Preece wap accordingly informed that this proposal could not be entertained. In the meantime, however, Mr. Wallace had received from our chairman a favourable reply to the letter which he addressed to him on the subject of the suggestion contained in your letter that a loan of 100,000L might be made upon the security of the Persian Government’s interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession, and Mr. Preece was accordingly authorised to negotiate with the Persian Government for a loan on this basis. I have to-day received a telegram from him advising that the Persian Govern ment are now willing to accept a loan of 100,000h at 5 per cent, on this security. I am therefore formally placing this proposal before the other directors of the company and have every reason to believe that they will approve. Mr. Wallace, when he w’as last in town, desired me to say, with regard to the last paragraph of your letter of the 8th September, that he is not, and does not propose to become, a director of the mining syndicate or company. He will be merely a passing shareholder. In the meantime I am acting as the managing director of the mining syndicate, and dealing with all matters connected with the concession which Mr. Preece is seeking to obtain. Mr. Wallace, by the way, remains the vice-chairman of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He resigned the managing directorship in my favour last January, and I have in that capacity dealt and am dealing with your letter of the 8th September, though it is addressed to the vice-chairman. ^CONFIDENTIAL.

It would be otherwise were the sum a very large one (see my telegram No. 275). The only ground that I see on which the Russian Government could object to the transaction as described by Mr. Moore is that the southern customs would no longer be available as a security for an eventual joint advance by the two Powers (see my despatches Nos. 350 and 356), but there would seem to be little force in this objection.a CONFIDENTIAL IV 170CT1910 '■'sa''' nr^ N^i If 'I Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O’ (N °' vYvnp * i m o!Tr (*111 Foreign Office, October 15, 1910, 12'30 p.m. \Ol R telegram No. 280 [of 14th October], last sentence.

Sir G. Barclay has been informed in reply that His Majesty’s Government cannot assent to the proposed loan if its conclusion is disagreeable to the Russian Government. Messrs.

Seligman Brothers to Foreign Office.—{Received September 28.) Sir, 18, Austin Friars, London, September 26, 1910. WE have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated the 22nd September, 1910, in reply to our letter of the 15th instant. ^ 1. In answer to your question with regard to the security it is proposed to assign for the loan, we would refer you to the previous correspondence, especially to our letter of the 13th May, in which we categorically informed you that the contract would only be entered into if approved by the Foreign Office. At this stage we have not taken up the question of any particular security, which would be largely dependent on the size of the loan. We can only repeat that no security will be considered until after consultation with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and subject to the approval of your department. We desire to express our regret that our former assurance upon this point appears to have been overlooked. 2. With regard to your second question, e.g., “ what proportion of shares would be offered for sale in foreign markets ? ” it is not contemplated to issue any shares at all. We propose to follow the procedure usually adopted in similar cases, such as the loan we financed for the city of Rio de Janeiro for 2,000,000Z. last year under the guarantee of the Brazilian Government. The contract with the Persian Government would be solely in our name, and we should issue the bonds here, and in case we considered the amount offered too large for England to absorb, the remainder would be distributed amongst our correspondents in the countries named, who would either make a public issue or sell them in blocks, whichever they might find the more convenient. 3. We would beg to point out that no power on earth can prevent foreigners obtaining bonds if they wish, as they would buy them in London once an issue is made ; in the same way as exchequer bonds of this country are largely held abroad. No company will be formed to float this loan, the entire control remaining in our hands. 4. If His Majesty’s Government would prefer it, we can arrange a loan for about 1,000,000/. without the co-operation of our foreign correspondents, but would rather arrange for an issue of 2,000,000/. or 2,500,000/. with their co-operation, in either case the contract being subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. We have reason to believe that our financial assistance to Persia would be favourably received by the Russian Government, and we feel strongly that if any real good is to be rendered to Persia nothing less than 2,000,000/. or 2,500,000/. will be of permanent service. We now ask whether, if the following conditions are adhered to, Secretary Sir Edward Grey is prepared to allow us to issue abroad as well as here, and to view the proposed loan favourably. 5. (1.) No foreign correspondents to acquire any control of any kind or to take any official part in the negotiations, their sole interest consisting of a possible purchase from us of the bonds to be offered for sale. (2.) The contract and securities to be subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and mention of this fact to appear in our prospectus. Awaiting the favour of an early reply, we have, &amp;c. SELIGMAN BROTHERS. [2894 ee —2]No. 1. Messrs. Seligman Brothers to Foreign Office.—(Received September 15.) Sir, 18, Austin Friars, London, September 15, 1910. IN continuation of the previous correspondence referring to a Persian loan, we have the honour to inform you that an enquiry has reached us, asking us whether we would lend that Government approximately 2,000,000L We are of opinion that at the present time a loan of this magnitude could not he raised in this market alone upon reasonable terms ; but if your department had no objection to the co-operation of our correspondents in Holland, France, Germany and Switzerland, or such of them as we may wish to interest with us, we consider that the business will be feasible, always assuming that satisfactory terms can be concluded with the Persian Government. Please understand that the negotiations will be entirely conducted between the Persian Government and ourselves only, and without reference to our correspondents. Further, the contract would be between our firm and the Persian Government only. Our correspondents would not be interested until the contract was concluded. As the matter is one of some urgency, may we ask you to favour us with a reply at your earliest convenience. We have, &amp;c. SELIGMAN BROTHERS.

ON the receipt of your telegram No. 581 of the 16th instant I called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and handed to him the aide-memoire, of which I have the honour to enclose a copy, respecting the proposed loan by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government of 100,0002. on the security of the Crown jewels, adding some verbal arguments as to the advisability from the point of view of the two Powers of sanctioning the transaction. M. Sazonow said at the time that it would be necessary for him, before giving a reply, to consult the Ministry of Finance. As it appeared from SirG. Barclay’s telegram No. 374 of the 21st instant that there had been a misunderstanding in the matter, I asked M. Sazonow to-day how it stood. He said that he regretted that, owing to an error made in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, M. Poklewsky had been told that His Majesty’s Government asked not mertTly for the concurrence, but for the participation of the Russian Government in the loan. The mistake has now been set right, but M. Poklewsky had called attention to the point that the Bussian Bank, by the terms of its concession, had the exclusive right to negotiate mortgages on Persian State property. M. Sazonow said that the decision rested with the Finance Ministry, and that he was awaiting a communication from them. I said that I had clearly understood, and had so reported to you, that the Russian Government had no wish to make a loan to the Persian Government themselves. To this his Excellency assented. I added that it seemed to me that it would be easy for the Imperial Bank to make the proposed loan without prejudice to any special privileges possessed by the Russian Bank. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. Enclosure in No. 1. Aide-memoire communicated to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs by Mr. O'Beirne. THE Persian Government have applied to the Imperial Bank of Persia for a loan of 100,0002. on the security of the Crown jewels for the purpose of establishing order in the provinces. The Imperial Bank are being informed that His Majesty’s Government see no objection to the proposal, and Sir E. Grey hopes that the Russian Government will concur. The proposal includes an arrangement under which about 200,000 krans of the debt due to the bank would be paid off, and it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to prevent a commercial transaction of this nature. Sir E. Grey would be glad to be favoured as soon as possible with the reply of the Russian Government. St. Petersburgh, September 4 (17), 1910.

The Imperial Bank, though anxious to get better security for the money advanced to private individuals, apart from Government debt, does not wish to press the arrangement proposed by the Persian Government. They have instructed bank manager accordingly. His Majesty’s Government hope, however, that in view of this they may count on the Russian Government not opposing a loan from British sources later on, and when conversion is completed, as it is difficult for His Majesty’s Government to explain to various applicants that they cannot favour a loan on ground of Russian opposition. The statement that Great Britain is obtaining all the advantages and Russia none from the Persian Government would be easy to refute. Our southern trade is rapidly disappearing, and our position in the Gulf will suffer a serious set-back. If this state of things continues, the situation can only develop to the advantage of a third Power, who will start on an equality of competition with us, when, and if, trade conditions become normal.

Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he must confer with Minister of Finance, but that the latter attached really great importance to the conversion of bank debts.

Persian Government now ask for loan of 500,000Z. at 92 at 6 per cent., secured as second charge on southern customs and telegraphs and also on oil and mining shares. This revives the question raised in your telegram No. 250, regarding which I can only say that surplus of southern customs, after the service of ours and hank’s debts and quasi-fixed charges have been met (which latter with Russia we have a,greed to make a permanent charge on the customs), is at the present level of the customs receipts an illusory security until the bank’s debt is extinguished or at least reduced to the sum allowed by charter. Whether, therefore, it is pledged for oil company’s loan or not makes little practical difference as regards security immediately available for eventual joint loan. If the Persian Government applies to us, which is most unlikely until the temper of the Medjliss changes, we shall, in any case, have to look rather to the mint profits than to the customs.

Yes, so long as the amount remained unchanged, 1 could not arrange to dispense with all the securities named, hut this fresh departure changes the whole landscape. The Persians appear to make two alternative proposals, viz.:— 100,000Z. secured by certain Persian public revenues ; or, 200,000Z. secured by the said revenues plus Persian Government’s interest and share of profits in the oil concession ; while you would prefer a third alternative, viz. : 100,0001. secured by the Persian Government’s interest and share of profits in the oil, and in a prospective mineral concession. Now this last alternative appears to me to chiefly concern the shareholders of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and not to come quite within the scope of the object that I had in view at the time of the breakdown of negotiations for an Anglo-Russian loan to Persia last April. lam not, therefore, returning to London in consequence of it, but I have written to the chairman and to the managing director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company recommending your suggestion to their careful consideration.

I am telling him that, provided we are satisfied that only British capital is involved, I do not foresee objection from His Majesty’s Government, but I can give no definite opinion until I have particulars as to the operation contemplated and can discuss them with my Russian colleague. I believe that Moore has at the back of his mind an idea of a big loan pledged on Persian customs, which, besides extinguishing the debts to the two banks, would leave Persian Government a substantial balance. (Private.) French Minister hears privately from the Ministry at Paris that there are Germans interested in Seligman’s schemes for Persia. Moore denies this.

I said that I believed the Russian tio\&lt; rnment would lather see a loan made by the oil company than find themselves called upon to take part in one themselves, and I asked if I was right in so thinking. M. Sazonow at once agreed that this was the case, but said that, even if the Persian Government did secure the proposed loan from the company, it would not long suffice for their needs, and they w^ould be sure to come to the two Powers for further financial assistance within the next few months. If the southern customs had meanwhile been made part security for the company s loan, there would then remain no sufficient security for an advance by the two Powers. The proposed loan by the company did not therefore constitute a real solution of the present difficulty. His Excellency would have thought it preferable if the company could have arranged for a loan of a larger amount, such as would have removed the necessity for the Persian Government of subsequently applying to the two Powers. M. Sazonow had evidently not gone into the question how far it would be practicable for the Anglo-Persian Company to find security for a much larger loan than that now contemplated. But his remarks make it plain that, from the point of view of the Russian 'Government, the main thing to be desired is that they should not themselves have to advance money to the Persian Government.

I enquired whether the Russian Government had any objection to the company s agent in lehran being authorised to sign the contract without further delay. M. Sazonow said at once that in principle the Russian Government entirely approved , of a loan such as proposed ; and I may mention here that a good reason for their welcoming an advance of money to the Persian Government by private firms is that it removes the pressing need for an advance by the two Powers, in which as you are aware the Russian Government agreed to join only in deference to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government and to which the Russian Finance Minister in particular consented with the greatest reluctance. M. Sazonow added, however, that the Russian Government had this objection to the immediate signature of the loan contract, that it would in their opinion destroy all prospect of the conversion of the debts due from the Persian Government to the Russian bank. Yesterday, his Excellency handed to me the memorandum of which I have the honour to enclose a translation (Enclosure No. 2) giving the substance of a telegram from the Russian Minister at Tehran on the subject of the proposed loan. M. Poklewsky, after giving details regarding the proposed agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Persian Government, expresses the opinion that from the point of view of Russian interests it would be unquestionably desirable that the contract should he postponed until the completion of the negotiations for the conversion of the debts due to the Russian bank, “ to which ‘ conversion,’ he adds, “ the Persian Government are to proceed one of these days.” In handing me this communication, M. Sazonow remarked, that its concluding sentence seemed to hold out some hope of the conversion of the bank debt being carried through. His Excellency also called my attention to M. Poklewsky’s statement that the company wished the surplus of the southern customs to be made part security for the proposed loan, and he seemed to consider that this would he inconsistent with the stipulation agreed to by His Majesty’s Government at the commencement of last month, to the effect that both southern and northern customs should be security for the joint advance then in contemplation by the two Powers. I said, in reply, that if the oil company’s loan was concluded, I rather supposed that the idea of the joint advance would be dropped. The question of the security for the latter would, therefore, not arise. I need not report to you the arguments which I have used to M. Sazonow on . different occasions to show that the conclusion of the oil company’s loan would not in ; reality be prejudicial to the conversion of the debts to the Russian bank. It is i evident that the Russian Government wish to delay the company’s loan not because it would in itself prejudice the conversion of the floating debts, but because by with holding their consent to it they can bring pressure to bear to expedite the conversion negotiations. I may point out, however, that if it came to a choice between a loan ■ being made to the Persian Government by a private firm, and the Russian Govern ment being called upon to join in an advance, they would greatly prefer the former alternative. It is possible, therefore, that if the Persian Government, in view of the postponement of the company’s loan, now apply to the two Powers to carry out their offer of an advance which is still open, the Russian Government might be disposed to reconsider the position which they have taken up in this question.

No final agreement has yet been arrived at between the Government of the Shah and the Anglo-Persian Naphtha Company. Only the general basis of such an agreement has so far been drawn up which is as follows :— The amount of loan to be 500,000Z. at percent, at 83 per 100 , which will give the Persians a clear 415,000/. The term of amortisation is sixty years. In addition the company receives, instead of the three (3) concessions previously proposed, the right to work all minerals approximately between 32 and 40 parallels (meridian of Greenwich), and from the 30|- parallel south to the sea. Upon the formation of the company for working this concession, the Persian Government receives in cash the sum of 30,000/. ; 20,000 shares and 10 per cent, of the net profits ^revenue). The company also binds itself to advance the Persian Government a sum amounting to 500,000/. for the construction of a tram way, probably from Bunder-Abbas to the mines. The tramway will be constructed by the company at the expense of the Persian Government, will be controlled by the company, moreover, the company will enjoy a reduction of 33 per cent, on the general tariff for loading the property of the company conveyed on the line. As security for the loan the company demands, in addition to the shares of the Persian Government in the naphtha business, revenue from the telegraphs and residue from the receipts of the southern customs. To this the Persians have not as yet agreed. From the point of view of our interests, I consider it unquestionably desirable that the above-mentioned agreement shall be postponed until the completion of the negotia tions respecting the conversion of the debts owing to our bank, to which conversion the Persian Government are to proceed one of these days.

Freece has suggested to Persian Government as security for loan of 200 OOOL Persian Government s share in oil company and mining company. He has not in ormed his syndicate of this, but he has no doubt that thev would consent, subject to granting of the concession. ^ I understand from Preece that his syndicate’s negotiations will probably be considered at oil company s board meeting on 5th September. it* 1 successful issue of present negotiations is so greatly in the interests of His Majesty’s Government and Government of India that it would be worth while to exert influence with the syndicate to empower Preece to negotiate on the lines he lias indic ated as acceptable to Persian Government, especially in regard to tramway. In case you are deterred from this course by Indo-European Telegraph Company’s scheme (see your telegram No. 246), I would urge following considerations :— M hatever may lie the attitude of the Medjliss in regard to proposed concession— and although \ ekill-el-Roya is hopeful, I am a little doubtful—Medjliss would be, I am sure, strongly opposed to Indo-European Telegraph Company’s scheme, which contemplates a British road.

If 1 ersian Government were to renew to two Powers request for advance now, oil company, who are only lending to oblige us and in substitution for such an advance, would retire from the undertaking with pleasure. Difficulty, however, would arise if, after oil company’s loan was concluded, Persian Government were to apply to two Powers for further advance, as, surplus of southern customs revenue haying been used as security for oil company’s loan, no sufficient security would remain, and two Powers, though anxious to oblige Persian Government, would have to refuse. On the other hand, oil company cannot see their way to lend without obtaining southern customs and telegraph revenues as supplementary security. Deadlock has therefore been reached, and oil company’s negotiations are in danger of breaking down. Can you suggest any solution? There is reason to believe from Mr. Preece’s reports that Persian Government already contemplate subsequent application to two Powers.

As to the scheme which you told me had been proposed to couple the conversion of the debt to the Russian Bank above referred to with the flotation of a Russian loan in London, it is not clear to us here exactly how this can be done, but, so far as v^e can see at present, there can be no reason why w^e should object to such a transaction.

If this is insisted on the prospects of obtaining concession will be seriously affected. , A trunk line to Kerman would eventually also serve rich minefields to the west of Kerman, and will probably lead to the [?] extension to Yezd, to the great advantage of our trade there.CONFIDENTIAL.

I have received reply from Minister for Foreign Affairs, of which following is the substance :— (R.) “ Members of the present Persian Cabinet have always manifested unfriendly sentiments towards Russia by encouraging anti-Russian movement in Persia, and by constantly paralysing efforts of the former Government to establish normal relations with the Russian Government. It is consequently necessary, before assisting present Cabinet, to wait till it expresses a desire for such assistance, and thereby in a certain measure affords a guarantee of its intention to observe henceforward more correct attitude towards Russia. r -r^ • ^ “According to information possessed by the Ministry of loreign Aitairs, the Persian Government are in no wise ignorant that the two Governments are ready to advance necessary funds. A fresh declaration to that effect does uot therefore appear necessary, especially as, in view of the political and economical crisis in Persia and of recent warning given to Persian Government in regard to securities for a foreign loari, it is most doubtful if a third Power would consent to lend money to Persia without the support of Russia and England. # . t&gt; • n “ Russian Government are of opinion that, m order to induce Persian Government to revive question of an advance, it would suffice if the two representatives were to draw the attention of the Persian Government as frequently as possi^e to the absence of security on roads and throughout whole country.

Foreign Office, July 28, 1910, 2 p.M. LATEST reports from Tehran indicate that disorder all over Persia, and particularly in south, is quickly increasing, and must soon produce complete anarchy. During June Tehran-Ispahan road was unsafe owing to outrages by notorious Naib Hussein, and servants of Indo-European Telegraph Company were assaulted and robbed by armed men about 7 miles east of Tehran itself. The mails were also twice looted near Kum. Three or four cases of robbery have occurred in immediate neighbourhood of Ispahan, while state of road between Ispahan and Bushire, which, as you know, has long been almost impassable and has entailed heavy losses on British trade, showed no signs of improvement after arrival of new Governor-General, who is reported to be utterly venal and incompetent. Kermanshah was threatened by Kalhurs, and governor, being without means of dissuade tribe from.attack. On Yezd-Tabbas-Meshed road large British Indian caravan was captured by robbers, and in Seistan Afghan gun-runners continually destroyed Indo-European hard to see how order can ever be restored without intervention on large scale. For reasons stated in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 223 to Mr. Marling, money cannot for some time be forthcoming from private sources (if, indeed, security which I remain of opinion, on grounds set forth in succeeding paragraphs of same telegram, that Great Britain and Russia should spontaneously offer advance of 400,000/. on conditions there proposed. I do not overlook objections to this course put forward by Mr. Marling in his telegram No.^300, but, on consideration, think that they are counterbalanced by improvement in position of two Powers which would result from it. You should put situation before Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and urge on his Excellency the desirability of making a joint representation to the Persian Govern ment about the state of the roads, telling them that want of money is no excuse for their doing nothing to police the roads, since 400,000/. would be forthcoming from England and Russia without conditions, except that it should be properly spent. A joint representation in these terms would place us in a strong position in the event of a foreign loan being proposed by a third Power. repelling attack, had to appeal to British and Russian consulates to endeavour to Telegraph Department’s Central Persia line and forced British staff to flee to Rabat. Persian Government appear to realise deplorable situation, but state that they have neither men nor money to meet it, and unless they can obtain both immediately it is could be offered is good enough ever to enable Persian Government so to obtain it), andCONFIDENTIAL.

Chance of application being made to two Towers by Persian Government is certainly small at present, but on the other hand Persian Government have no revenues which could be pledged for service of a loan of any considerable amount (see . my despatch No. 127,Vhich should reach you by bag on 31st duly), and considering state of country and entire absence of proper financial administration, its general credit is nil, and must remain so until practical reform is initiated. In order to obtain mining concessions and to secure oil shares remaining in hands of Persian Government, it may suit Strathcona group to make a small advance to Persian Government, but even for service of the small amount contemplated 1 think that it will be difficult to secure adequate security. . . . . . 1 have of course no means of making an exhaustive examination into 1 ersian finance, but the Russian Minister and the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia concur in the belief that any operation on a large scale is from a strictly financial standpoint quite impossible for the present. In these circumstances I see no objection to proposed intimation to would-be lenders | on the contrary, airival of financial expert to examine possibility of a loan might serve to dispel illusions of the Persian Government. . , ,, . „ . . . , ^ I suppose that we need not apprehend a “ political loan from the third 1 bwer. f? Whole of the] Russian Bank’s claims could be settled, Russian Minister informs me as easilv as those of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and delay is due to Persians them selves although it is manifestly in their own interest to expedite it so as to obtain reduction of interest from about 12 to 7 per cent. To refuse Persia facilities to obtain advance, or to give it ourselves, would probably hasten conclusion of Lussian Lank s \s to proposal to offer advance unsolicited, while it would strengthen our position as ao-ainst a third Power, it would confirm belief entertained and propagated by extreme nationalists that it is the design of the two Powers to put financial letteis on Persia Persian Government is quite aware that the two Governments aie leacly to make an advance without political conditions and has only been prevented from aonlvine to them by the unreal!sable hopes held cut by such offers as Sehgman s, and by 'noisy national faction which has sacrificed the country s interests to them I think that embarrassment of Treasury is so great at present that if advance were made very little of it would be devoted to restoration of order. Nasr-ul-Mulk told me confidentially the other day that the extravagance of the new regime has been so great that an advance of 400,0001. would now be insufficient.[This Document is the Pro perty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] ^ s ^ L /&gt; PERSIA.

WE are obliged for your favour of the 13th July, which you have caused to be sent to us, concerning the question of negotiating a loan with the Persian Government. We note that the situation in Persia has changed since our last correspondence on this subject, and that now His Majesty’s Government would be prepared, under certain conditions, to sanction a scheme for a loan to the Government mentioned.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant relative to the question of rendering financial assistance to the Persian Government. I am to inform you in reply that the situation in Persia has changed since the date of the letter from this Office to which you refer, and that there now appears to be less likelihood than there was a short time ago that the Persian Government will again apply to His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments for an advance of money. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government would not oppose any scheme for a loan to the Persian Government by a British group of sound standing, provided that the conditions of the transaction were such as could be approved by them and by the Russian Government. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY. T2824 Ti—ll(Private and Confidential.) Shell House, 104 and 105, Bishopsgate Street Within, Sir, London, July 7, 1910. WE beg to refer to the letter which you wrote us on the 12th March, owing to the contents of which we informed you that we would not at the moment undertake any financial business for the Persian Government. In view of what^ you were good enough to tell us at the interview which we had with you concerning the financial situation in Persia, and of the statement in your letter of the 12th March, that the securities offered by the Persians were already pledged to other parties, we feel it is only right that we should tell you that we have received information to the effect that the firm of Messrs. Seligmann Brothers is stated now to be represented at Tehran with a view to securing the very business about which we wrote and saw you, and, further, that they are stated to be working on behalf of the Deutsche Bank. This information we can in no sense state to be genuine, though we have no reason to doubt the credibility of our informant, and we only pass it on to you in a strictly private and confidential manner, as matter which you might desire to verify for yourself in the event of your not having any authentic information. We should be glad to know whether it is still the view of the Foreign Office that no British firm could receive their support in carrying out such a project as we laid before you in March, and whether we are right in assuming that the Foreign Office could take no step to prevent the business being carried through by a firm representing foreign interests. We remain, &amp;c. M. SAMUEL and Co. [2824 A—2]A CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling {Tehran). (No. . Foreign Office, July 22, 1910, 12-40 p.m. 1 I KLbL ME you still remain of opinion that there is no longer any likelihood that Persian Government will apply on their own initiative to Great Britain and Russia for an advance. If so, I think that, in view of Persian Government’s pressing need of monev, we should inform all who intimate to us their desire to offer loans to Persia that we will not oppose such transactions, provided lenders are British and can satisfy us of their financial soundness, and provided they do not tamper with security already pledged to Great Britain and Russia. r lhey should also be told that they must not expect us to incur any responsibility in connection with such private loans. At the same time, since the Russian Government insist that completion of arrange ment for consolidation of Persian Government’s debt to Russian Bank must precede any private loan, it is clear that Persian Government will be unable for many months to obtain money in this way. Meanwhile, situation will continue to grow worse, especially in south, and probability will increase that Persian Government, in despair, will turn to a third Power. Should they do so, and should that Power intimate willingness to lend without conditions, Great Britain and Russia would presumably be obliged to object. In reply to their objections, third Power could point out that two Governments occupy in Persia position which they do solely in order to introduce order and good government in country, but that situation has only grown worse because they will neither lend Persian Government money themselves without onerous conditions nor allow them to obtain it elsewhere. This argument would be difficult to answer, and it appears to me that position of two Powers would be greatly strengthened if they were forthwith, on their own initiative, to offer to Persian Government the advance of 400,000/., subject to no conditions except such as relate to security and repayment. If Persian Government accept, our object will be attained. If they decline, we should still leave offer open and thus have good grounds for refusing to allow them to borrow from third Power should they attempt to do so, for they could not then justify themselves by alleging refusal on our part to lend. We should also have stronger ground for representation suggested in your despatch No.’ 114, as to which I shall telegraph separately very soon. Offer of advance might be accompanied by intimation that it is understood that sum advanced will be expended on restoration of order and security, and on reorgani sation of financial administration. I should be glad to receive your views on these proposals before submitting them to Russian Government. You may consult Russian Minister.

I have read a memorandum from the Russian Government which argues that in the identic note of the two legations of 7th April it was stipulated that the conversion of the debts due to the Russian and British Banks should precede any loan made to the Persian Government other than those which might he made by Russian and British Governments; that British Bank has succeeded in converting its debts, but that Russian Bank has not yet done so. Russian Government believe that oil syndicate’s offer has not been eagerly received by the Persian Government, as other financiers are pretending that they can supply large sums at 5 per cent, interest, which is manifestly impossible. Russian Government still maintain the condition laid down in the identic note, but have no desire to oppose discussions between the oil syndicate and the Persian Government as to an advance, and hope that they may be kept informed of the course of the negotiations.

With the consent of the Russian Minister, Preece approached the Persian Govern ment with a proposal of advance on 30th June, but the Minister of Finance has told him that the terms are unacceptable ; this reply is unquestionably due to the overtures made by Moore and Osborn. As to the Russians’ stipulation for precedence of settlement of Persian debts to Russian Bank, northern customs provide barely sufficient security, so that collateral security is required, and the Russian Government are naturally averse from seeing suitable security affected to other purposes. The oil shares, as they at present pay no dividend, can of course only be regarded as collateral security for the proposed advance by the Strathcoua group, who would therefore require a lien on some existing revenue.

Seligman were negotiating for a loan to the Persian Government, and that, as far as he could judge, this might be done upon conditions which would not be unfavourable either to Russian or British interests. Count Benckendorff impressed upon me, however, that this was only M. Poklewski’s personal view. I told his Excellency what had passed with Mr. Moore in this Office before he went to Tehran. His Majesty’s Government were not encouraging any loan, and whatever was being done was being done quite independently of them. I had some time ago favoured the idea that the Persian Government might be supplied with money through the purchase by the British owners of an oil concession of the shares which the Persian Government held in that concession, for such an arrangement would not have impaired the securities of either the British or Russian Government in Persia, and it would have prevented the transfer to foreigners of the shares which the Persian Government held in a British concession. This was a matter which stood by itself ; but even with regard to this, I had not done anything since the Persian Government had revived the proposal, which was apparently now again in suspense, of applying to the British and Russian Governments for a loan.
