                           hijrafrom Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. The surrounding text refers to the founding of the mosque as well as its relative importance, due to the association between the place and Qur’anic notions of piety.The building itself does not take central place in the composition; rather, palm groves occupy the foreground and middleground, while the crenellated walls, lone minaret and four visible domes of the mosque occupy the central and left background. The text refers to the ‘green and fertile land’ surrounding the mosque. A lone Ottoman soldier is posed immediately left of the central foreground.InscriptionsRecto:Upper centre: ‘Picture of the Mosque of Quba’To the right and left of the title:‘Come, have a look – this is that mosque of Quba which is the prayer place of “the essence of the beloved of Divine Grandeur” [the prophet Muhammad]Look, the holy Qur'an praises it, for it has been built, since the beginning of creation for its piety.’To the right and left of the image:‘The road to it runs through green and fertile land. The Bedouins run alongside the road begging people for alms. The pilgrimage is performed at the mosque of Quba after a prayer of two cycles. This is the mosque whose praise is found in the holy Qur'an: “Indeed a mosque founded on the observance of piety from the first day is more deserving that you should stand in it. In it are men who love to purify themselves” [Qur’an 9:108] During the hijra, the Prophet stayed here initially for sixteen days, conferring honour upon it. After this he honoured Medina with an arrival that was bound to confer felicity.Lower centre: ‘H. A.
