Kemball writes that, while in the vicinity of the town during his recent expedition to Bahrain, he despatched Commodore Robinson to Fuwairat to make enquiries about the incident. There are two enclosures following Kemball’s letter:1. Letter no.380 of 1854 (folios 162-63) from Kemball to Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, dated 14 November 1854. The letter contains instructions relating to Robinson's enquiries at Fuwairat. Kemball writes that, given that the Sheikh of Fuwairat is denying responsibility for the plunder of property in his port, the matter should be deferred to Shaikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah] in Bahrain, within whose territory Fuwairat is situated;2. Letter no.184 of 1854 (folio 164) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 4 December 1854. Robinson writes that, upon making enquiries in Bahrain, it appears that both parties in the dispute over plundered property at Fuwairat have reached a mutual agreement, meaning that it is not necessary to interfere in the case. However, Robinson writes that, during his interview with Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah, he did not fail to remind the ruler of Bahrain of his responsibility in any similar cases.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00001b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
