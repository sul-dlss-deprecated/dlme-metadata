Sir, I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, the two enclosed reports by B 'f^ dl . er ' G ®^ al H. T. Brooking, C.B., on the action ot the 9lh September 191J, m which a stronsr body of Tangistani raiders was ousted at the point of ^ he difficult ground, and completely routed, with heavy loss, by the skilfully combined action of infantry, artillery and cavalry. 2. General Brooking was sent by me to Bushire on 20th August last when the situation there was giving rise to some anxiety. By his energetic handling of affairs, culminating in the defeat of the enemy before they had time to deliver a serious attack, General Brooking has placed matters in a satisfactory state and successfully relieved the situation, and I would specially bring his services to notice. 3. I would also commend the bravery and endurance of the troops in most trying heat which claimed several victims, as well as the valuable assistanc afforded by a landing party of the Royal Navy. I entirely endorse the mention of individual instances of gallantry and srood service made by General Brooking ; and I would call special notice to the determined charge of the squadron 16th Cavalry, \ w. h. Pennington, 12th Cavalry, attached • 16th Cavalry, m which British officers and half of the Indian officers lost their lives. I have the honour to be.

BUSHIRE, To T HE MAJOR -GENERAL, GENERAL STAFF, Indian Expeditionary Force ' D S ib, I have the honour to report that At 6-30 a m ., on 9th September when passing the reserve at Imam Zada I met a patrol coming in, which told mo that there were about 20 of the enemy in the nullahs to the south of Zangena, and that they had been fired upon. I rode on to No. 10 Post. On arrival there at 6-45 a.m .» I thought from the firing that there was a considerable number of the enemy collected in the nullahs, so at once ordered : — (1) Outpost reserve to move from Imam Zada to No. 10 Post. (2) Support of No. 1 Section to move from Subzabad to No. 3 Post. (3) Support of No. 2 Section to work southwards through palm trees on edge of mashileh from Mahommed Jaffir as far as Zangena. (4) The detachment from the ' Pyramus ' to move on Imam Zada from Reshire. (5) The general reserve at the Malik's House and Amin's House to fall in ready. (6) The whole of the cavalry to move out on to the mashileh. 2. The outpost reserve reached me at 7-40 a.m . It consisted of 2 Turkish field guns, 2 Turkish mountain guns, 4 machine guns, 1 company 9oth berar Infantry, and 1 company lith Kajputs, under Major ^Vard. I ordered one company to move due south and one company with 2 maehine guns to move round to the left of the enemy towards B, whilst the artillery moving up under cover came into action, Turkish field guns at. A, iurkisn mountain guns at Post No. 4. I sent two machine guns round to Zangena to support the advance from that flank. 3. By 8-15 a.m ., it was evident that I had not sufficient troops to push the attack home, so I ordered (1) ' Pyramus ' detachment from Imam Zada to march on the guns, (2) General reserve from Reshire to march on No. 10 Post; and at 8-45 a.m ., I ordered the support of No. 1 Section to move up towards point B and join the general reserve. Meanwhile with the force already up I held the enemy.4. At 9-10 a.m ., I ordered the Gurkhas up from Reshire. They had been out all night and I did not want to utilise them if it could be avoided. k At 0 45 am ., the general reserve • from Reshire under Lieutenant- ' ' 1? • i , 12n of Colonel Lane. 96th Berar Infantry, reach- • It consisted of 80 of lltb Rajput# and 120 of v^uiuuci xm . rnnnd mh infantry. ed me. I ordered them to move round the enemv's left towards point B under cover, to join the company of E a] puts there and the support from No. 1 Section o£ the outposts. Ihen, to fix bay- onets and charge straight down the nullahs eastwards. 6. At 10-15 a.m. Lieutenant-Colonel Lane charged the enemy and drove them down the nullah side into the palm trees and pursued them to the edge of the mashileh. The Gurkhas were just too late to take part. 7. The enemy of whom it is estimated there were 600 broke all along the line and fled out on to the mashileh. 8. Meanwhile the cavalry had been closing gradually in, and, seizing the opportunity, they charged through the enemy, doing considerable damage. 9. The enemy then fled across the mashileh towards Chaghadak and Gurak, leaving many of their deid and wounded. I pursued them with gunfire, as they were, too fleet across the sand for the infantry to catch them, though' they did their utmost to do so, and the cavalry owing to their heavy losses were somewhat disorganised. A good many of the enemy fell, far out on the mashileh, from this gunfire. The enemy managed to carry most ot these away on donkeys. 10. I actually collected 43 of the enemy's dead and brought them in. I also captured 14 wounded and 4 unwounded prisoners. J These 1 think represent but a small portion of their losses. I am endea vouring to find out approximate figures and shall report as soon as ascertained. 11. I regret to have to report the following casualties («) Rilled. Major W. H. Pennington, 12th Cavalry, attached 16th Cavalry. 2nd Lieutenant L. I. L Thornton, I. A. R, attached 16th Cavalry. Rissaldar Prem Sukh, 16th Cavalry. # Jemadar Gopal, 16th Cavalry. Seamen—2.

Fbom To The GENEEAL OFFICEH COMMANDING, BUSHIRE, MAJOR GENERAL, GENERAL STAFF, Indian Expeditionary Force 'J).' Sie, With reference to my No. 273-B. of 10th September, paragrnph 12, I have the honour to report that when all ranks did so well it is difficult to pick out those deserving of special notice, hut even when such happens, some come well to tlie front. Therefore I venture to bring the following to the notice of the Army Commander :— Captain W. E. Wilson-Johnston, 36th Sikhs, my Brigade Major. —The fact that I could place absolute confidence in him to carry out my orders relieved me of much anxiety. To the clear and precise orders issued by him the success of the operations on tbe 9th September was largely due. Captain G. R, Plinston, 11th Bajputs, my Staff Captain. —He carried out his work as Staff Captain in a most efficient manner. To his foresight is due the fact that water and ammunition throughout the action were abundant and that the best possible arrangements were made for the evacuation of casualties. Major W. E. Pennington, 12th Cavalry, attached 16th Cavalry. —He led his squadron, only some sixty strong, gallantly into the middle of some 400 of the enemy, where he fell. This charge thoroughly disorganised the enemy and I recommend him for some posthumous reward, 2nd Lieutenant L.I. L, Thornton^ attached 16th Cavalry. I These fell nobly supporting BissaldarPrem Sukh, 16th Cavalry. C Major Pennington. Jemadar Gopal, 16th Cavalry. ) Lieutenant E. C. Staples, 11th Bajputs. —He was in command of my brigaded machine guns. Even though wounded and left with only one wounded man to help him he continued to work one of the machine guns at close range for about an hour, until the action closed. He was eventually left to do this alone as the man supporting him was again wounded. I strongly recommend that this officer be granted the D. S. O. No. 1829 Sepoy Ramkishor Singh, 11th Bajputs. —This was the man who, although wounded, so ably supported Lieutenat Staples. I recommend him for the I. 0. M.8 Captain Ctrpenter, R. N., H. M. 5.
