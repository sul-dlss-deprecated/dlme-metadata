CAPTAIN C. H. H ABUT SON, POLITICAL AGENT, KHELAT. THE POLITICAL SUPERINTENDENT, FRONTIER UPPER SIND. Camp Jacobahad, 23rd December 1869. Sir, My report No. 10 having embraced all matters of interest in Beloochistan up to the 10th of June, I propose to briefly review subsequent events as reported from time to time. 2. The main objects that engrossed His Highness' Government during my residence at Khelat were the intrigues of the Jam of Beylah and the Mingul Sirdar, as also the probability of aggression by the Persian Govern ment towards Kedj. 3. As the J am of Beylah's conduct will occupy a prominent part in my present report, it may not be amiss to briefly allude to his antecedents. Before the time of the great Nusseer Khan, Beylah was not under Belooch rule, being a weak power, they had to succumb to this well known ruler. Beylah was left in charge of Meah Khan, the then Jam, and His Highness gave him his daughter in marriage, and thus made him a friendly tributary of the Khelat Government ; things went on in a peaceful and uninterrupted manner until the present Jam's accession to powerj^uring the past ten years r-^Xe has done every thing he possibly could to weaken the Khan's Government, either by intrigue or organizing Forces against the Khelat Government ' to take part in disputes that were no concern of his.' 4. His most successful intrigue was that which caused the failure of His Highness' campaign against the Murree tribe some eleven years ago. jffcgard- ing^ armed resistance against the Khan' ; these occurrences can scarcely be enumerated-Xo give some idea of their frequency, it may be as well to mention the Jam's having organized three Forces against the Khan during the past 12 months. 5. My letter No. 10 showed the ostensible cause of dispute and my advice to the Jam on the subject ; as the ill feeling still continued, I attempted( ^ ) to define in my letter Xo. 27 who were the rightful heirs, the continuation of this letter No. 28 reported that the Jam had withdrawn his Agent from the village in dispute. A few days later I had to continue the subject in No. 31, and to report that an Agent of the Jam's with an armed Force of Mmguls had not only removed the Government revenue from the village of Kumal Khan but from Mahomed Khan's village. His Highness was Very much annoyed at this, but with the view of keeping peace and quiet said he would overlook the insult if they returned the grain ; this they declined to do and stated they were prepared to take the consequences. His Highness then made arrangements that his Shagazee should go as soon as practicable to punish these rebellious chiefs ; other reasons for this active policy were shown in my letters Nos. 39 and 40, viz. the receipt of four treasonous letters trom the Jam of Beylah to His Highness' chiefs, as also the appeal for protection from the Sassoolies, Hootmanzais, and other people residing at Bhagwanah. G. The Khan had intended going in person and asked me to accompany him, but bearing in mind the repeated instructions I had received not to interfere actively in the Government of the country, I told His Highness that it would do him more harm than good my being mixed up in the business, for, if success attended his present measures, the disaffected would state that he, the Khan, could never have managed it without aid from the English Government. His Highness appeared to appreciate what I said, and quite understood that no active aid would be given to him on this or any other occa sion. 7. The cold weather having set in, necessitated a move towards the plains, so I determined to return via the Bolan, as by so doing, I should not come in contact with the Khan's force, or the rebel chiefs. On arriving at Mastoong, I heard that emissaries from the Jam and Sirdar Noordeen were trying to per suade the Shawanees, Koords, and others to join them, this report was ncxer confirmed. T, however, thought I might indirectly benefit the Khan and the people, so stopped a month. During my stay, I heard that the Prime Minister had started for Bhagwanah ; his movements were so rapid that no combination could take place, and as no seriou^ opposition was to be feared, he pushed on at once to Wud ; the Minguls had only just time to escape with their families into the neighbouring hills. 8. From M.ustoong I proceeded to Quettah, and after remaining there a few days, marched down the Bolan and proceeded to the large and wealthy town of Bagh, where I stopped some days, as the people were greatly alarmed at passing events in Beloochistan. 9. On the 24th October, the Jam marched a force with seven guns to aid the Minguls, and took up a position at Furruk Burr, being joined on the 26th by Sirdar Noordeen and the Minguls; as no advance was made upon them, they concluded that the Shagazee must be afraid, so marched to within three miles of his camp ; occasional skirmishing took place, the Shagazee delaying in hopes( 93 ) that a force from Koiewali might act in combination with him ; the Jam and Sirdar Noordeen appear to have realized what plans were under contempla- tionj and were meditating flight, so the Shagazee marched on the 15th ultimo to dislodge them from the hill they occupied. After some hours fighting, the Jam and Sirdar Noordeen's force fled, leaving seven guns and all their ammu nition and camp equipage on the ground. About thirty or forty were killed. 10. A letter received by the Shagazee from the principal men of Beylah, marginally noted, stated that the Jam and Sirdar Noordeenj after having plundered Beylah, had fled to Kurrachee, ' that they themselves were harmless, inoffensive people, and were quite ready and willing to place themselves under His Highness' protection.' In connection with this letter, the Shagazee requested His Highness to write to the following Koongas in a kind and friendly manner (Ali Khan Chun- gool and Mettah.) 11. The Jam's career down to the present time shows him to have been the scourge and pest of Beloochistan for years past ; and that he has no hope of being allowed to resume his rule in Beylah is apparent from his having plun dered his people before seeking safety in Kurrachee. 12. Before leaving this subject, I would beg to state that, in consequence of a letter received from His Highness, I directed the Shagazee on arrival at Beylah to send some responsible person to report himself to the Commissioner in Sind to ascertain his wishes, particulars were stated in letter No. 51 ; when writing I asked the Shagazee to use his influence to prevent the poor and in^ offensive people of Beylah from being ill-used and plundered. 13. The second subject of Political importance to the Khan's Government was, as stated, probability of Persian aggression at Kedj ; at first His Highness was inclined to think that his Naib, Faquir Mahomed, had exaggerated the difficulties of his position, but on reading the N^ib's letters, I felt convinced that no man would have written as he had done without urgent cause, and am glad to say that His Highness had taken this view of the case before the receipt of telegram acknowledged in my letter No. 34 14. My letters Nos. 34 and 37 will show that His Highness was more or less hopeful that the English Government would afford him active aid and supply him with material to protect his territory on the Mekran Coast. My reply to him was that the Persian Government being on friendly terms with the English it would be impossible to assist him actively, and that giving him ammunition for war would be misunderstood, that he must act independently and rest assured that we would try and relieve his present embarrassments by diplomacy with the Shah of Persia.

Ilis Highness after taking into consideration what 1 had said, detach ed his Darogah, Attah Mahomed, with aTorce as detailed in my letter No. 34. Before, however, they had proceeded far on their way. His Highness wrote and directed that they were to consider themselves under the Shagazee's orders and act in combination with him if possible. I(&gt;. A short time ago it was reported that Ibrahim Khan, the Serhind of Bumpoor, who had caused aM these difficulties at Kedj, had died. I am not however in a position to state whether this is reliable information. 17- Having duly discussed the two subjects noted at the commencement of my letter, I will endeavour to touch upon other matters that may be of interest. 18. In my letter No; 14 1 afforded the explanation called for in Govern ment Uesolution, Political Department, dated 15th March 1869,regarding Oomer Khan Gitchee, and showed the Khan's anxiety to forward his interests ; from Naib Faquir Mahomed's letter attached to No. 37, it appears that Oomer Khan r whilst expecting consideration at His Highness' hands, was at the same time offering to go over to those who had acknowledged the Persian supremacy, under the proviso that they would make him Naib of Kedj and Toomb. J 9. At Khelat, Mustoong, Quettah, and other places I had many oppor- tunities of seeing kossid's, Kafilas, and other people passing through ; the only information however that I thought might not have been communicated through other sources was the apparent distrust of the present Afghan Government against the Persians—Shere Ali Khan, the Sirdar of Kandahar, having written to the Zuggur Mingul tribe stating that aggression on their part might be anticipated sooner or later,and recommended mutual support. Another subject I considered worthy of report was a conversation that I had with an Afghan Merchant, who had been trading in Kokan and Bokhara between Pashkend and Samarkand, the particulars of the conversation were detailed in my letter No. 47 under date 11th November 1869. 20. At Quettah, as a rule. His Highness generally stations a Company of his Regiment to protect the people against the Patans, Kakurs, and Hoomurs, these people occupy the hills about Quettah, Siriab, and the Dusht. The Satukzais, a branch of the Koord tribe, also live in the hills about Siriab and the Dusbt and have intermarried with the Doomurs. The Minguls, under their Chief Hybut, occupy the hilis from Much to Abgoom. The Muzeranees Koh Murree live in the hills to the right of Beebee Nanee under their Chief Shere Dil, and the Koochuks at Kertah under Pilloo Khan.( 97 ) 21. Each tribe taken individually is of little or no importance, the Xaib Tlic merchants pay 'black at Quettah acts in conjunction with Shere Dil mail ' for this profcction in Murree, as far as the safe transit of Kafilas through addition to transit dues. . iii i • t ^ r- n K. L 'hayhe . the Bolan is concerned, he has at his disposal 500 effective fighting men and gets a certain percentage on each Kafila, varying from 10 to 40 llupees. His capability of conducting this duty seems to be ac quiesced in by all the tribes inhabiting the Pass ; some I believe are subsidized, others he is prepared to punish if they interfere with him in any way. Xo attempt is made to furnish each Kafila with a large escort, only one or two of the Murree tribe are in attendance, and I think if the records are consulted it will be found that the system works well, and that obstruction is rarely or ever offered in the Pass itself, in fact all the Kafilas and kossids that have lately come down say that they have not the slightest fear about passing through the Bolan, they however dread the depredations that may be committed in the low hilly country between Dadur and Hajee -ka-Shere ; to obviate this ^ ^ w difficulty, Nawab Mahomed Khan has stationed Be- Reply to (otnnnssioners let- J t- ni ter No. 701 dated 27th No- looch levies at both these places, and Kafilas are vemher ISW). escorted backwards and forwards in perfect safety. Of course these levies would not be able to hold their own against raids on a large scale, but are quite sufficient to protect property Foofajee. against the depredations of smaller parties—for the Bushooree, safety of the people in the plains, mounted Belooch Knilli-ih sowars have been posted at the places marginally Gundavah. noted. 22. The arrangements in the Pass and on the plains of Cutchee, small as they are, appear to answer admirably, and His Highness only requires aid to continue and develcpe the plan ; there is no doubt that with a little trouble the traffic would increase to a great extent. Kafilas appear to be coming down in unusually large numbers this cold season, and merchants who have not frequented the Bolan route for some years say that they only came hearing that a Political Agent had been appointed ; the greatest part of the traffic would I fancy always go to the nearest seaport, Kurrachee, via Khelat, Kozdar and the Hubb. Horse Kafilas for Bangalore, dried iruits and other merchandize for Shikarpoor, Ahmedabad, Baroda and other places, would always select the Bolan route. 23. At Lehree I had a long conversation with Sorab Khan, the Sirdar of the Dhoombkees; owing to the dread of Murree raids there is but little cultiva tion. His Highness grants him thirteen kurars of jowaree per mensem, equi valent to about 350 llupees, this being inadequate to keep up his position, he is anxious to increase his means by taking up land in the Frontier Districts on the same favourable terms that have been accorded to other Belooch. 24. Referring to the correspondence regarding the Belooch Behmutoolla, forwarded under your endorsement of the 7th August, as also Government Ke- solution No. 2S1G, Political Department, dated 31st August, I have the honor( 98 ) to Inform 3 + ou that T have requested Ills Iligliness to have the fnovetneftts of this Belooch carefully watched. At Quettah a Hindustanee, who could not give a satisfactory reason for wandering through Beloochistan, was arrested, as it Was thought he might be acting in conjunction with this Beloooh. After a careful search, he was released, as only a few harmless letters were found in his possession addressed to people at Ilydrabad and Kurrachee. 2. j . His Highness whilst occupied in punishing those who for years past had been trying to subvert his authority, was not forgetful of those who were anxious to return to their allegiance. Sirdar Aladeenah Koord and Sirdat Adum Moolla Mahomed is with the Khan Wudorah went to Seebee after they had parted Beiruranee Nlurrees, and it has ^0 J am and gave as their reason that no one been reported from the noog- 0 tee hills that these Sirdars would belieVe that they had been forgiven. His fled alter him. Kmnums wdl IXighness hearing this, sent them a written order be made. 0 ' R, PHAYRE, sealed by him, stating that they might return to their country and live amongst their own people, and that if their conduct was such as met with his approval, that he would look upon them as his Sirdars ; the whole of the Eaizanee tribe sent Hybut Khan, the elder brother of their Sirdar Moolah Mahomed to Nawab Mahomed Khan, saying that they did not wish to join in any intrigues that might be got up against the Khan, and only wished to be allowed to remain quietly at Mitree. His Highness wrote two very kind letters to Hybut Khan, saying that he had no wish to interfere with them, and that no one should harm them so long as they adhered to their present irood intentions. 2G. Directly Sirdar Moolah Mahomed heard of the defeat of the Jam of Beylah and Sirdar Noordeen, lie fled with six followers to Khan, only one of whom was a Raizanee, the rest of the tribe elected to remain quietly at Mitree vmder Hybut Khan. «/ 27. Azad Khan, after leavinsf the ,Tam and Sirdar Moolah Mahomed in 7 o June last, saw that the object he had in view could not be attained through their means, so went to Candahar and tried to interest the Ameer and Sirdar Shere Ali Khan of Kandahar in his behalf; a lengthy correspondence ensued on this subject between the Klielat and Afghanistan Governments. His Highness' replies were dignified and appropriate, viz. that he should be most happy to restore Azad Khan the land that he held fur doing his, the Khan's service, 'when he chose to account to him for having plundered the village of Punchgoor and other aofgressive acts. CO 2S. Two or three Afghan Sirdars being displeased with Ameer Sherc Ali Khan, passed through Khelat enroute to Persia, Sirdar Surwut Khan was the first who arrived, and I at once requested Kawab Mahomed Khan to af&lt;k His Highness to follow the usual policy towards these fugitives, viz. after showing them hospitality, to request them to seek an asylum elsewhere than 011 his ^Frontier or in Bsloochistan,( !» ) 29. In concluding tills report, I wish to bring Doctor Bowman's very va luable services before the Government. From the lath April to 20th November seven thousand four hundred and five people were treated, of this number two thousand ei^'ht hundred and fifteen were either surgical or serious cases of ill- o o ness that necessitated admission into hospital. Doctor Bowman gained such repute amongst these wild people as a Surgeon and Oculist^ that they came any distance to consult him. During the few days we were at Quettah^ the attend ance at hospital was very large, Afghans, Patans, and various other people hav ing come more than fifty miles for treatment. Seeing the great advantage that is derived from having such a zealous and highly qualified Ofiicer in this Agency, I am naturally anxious that his pay should be drawn on the old scale as recom mended by the Government of Bombay in their Resolution, Political Depart- I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, C. n.

Sir, * In forwarding the accompanying report No. 54, dated 2:lrd instant, from the Political Agent Khelat, containing a precis of his sevenil reports quoted, I have the honor to invite attention to para. 4 which, so far as I have been able to discover, is scarcely borne out by the facts on record in this office.( wo ) For instance the Government correspondence as per margin pronounces His t , , _ Highness the Khan's campaign against the Murrees Bombay Government Letter . i n o No.2084, dated 25th May 1859, in the winter of 1858 -59 to have been a complete suc- and Resolution ot Goverunient. cess an j no men tion whatever is made of the Jam's (government of India Letter No. 3569, dated 13th June conduct at Kahun in 1858, until May 18C2, when ''political Superintendent's Ma j 0r He, ''y Green in excusin g the Khan's omis- report No. 52, dated 28th Ja- sion to coerce the Murrees, notwithstanding the 1111111 ' ' extra lis. 50,000 paid to him for that purpose, wrote as follows to Mr. Mansfield, the_Commissioner. * * * ' but although I was aware at the time that treachery existed amongst the Khan's forces, I was not aware of the extent until afterwards, or that the present Jam of Keyla when at Kahun (the Murree Head Quarters) proposed in open Durbar, uniting with that tribe, then turning the whole force on Jacobabad, which station had been still further weakened by a Squadron under Captain Dickinson having been ordered to Nuggur Parkur. Notwith standing, however, this treachery the expedition was so far successful, and the arrangement afterwards made, so far satisfactory that the British territory, until the raid now complained of, has remained free from Murree incur sions' * * * * The Jam's conduct was inexcusable, but it does not appear as put by Captain Harrison ' that his most successful intrigue was that which caused ' the failure of His Highness' campaign against the Murree tribe some eleven ' years ago.' , Had Major Henry Green veiwed the matter in this serious light, he would no doubt have reported it as soon as he became aware of it. Tn para 11 of the report under reply. Captain Harrison says that 'he ' (the Jam) has no hope of being allowed to resume his rule in Beyla is ' apparent from his having plundered his people before seeking safety in ' Kurrachee.' Owing to this allusion T deemed it right to ask Captain Harrison upon what grounds he based the above opinion. His reply is given in letter No. 5.5, annexed hereto.

' The Jam and his subordinate Chieftain Oomed Ali, are. as I have lono- 71 O since reported, in rebellion against the Khan of Khelat, but the Jam of Beyla has an undoubted right to levy any taxes he may think proper within his own territory, except transit dues on general merchandize passing through Belooch- istan.'' In January 1861, the then Political Superin- No. 50, 31st Januaiy 18G1. tendent, Major (now Sir W.) Merewether, described British relations to Khelat in the following terms :— ' As regards good faith, I would observe that since the day (1842) on T would particularly call at- ' which the British Government, by the hands of the tention to the whole of this ' then Political Agent, Major Outram, placed the therein I hol/'stTll and They ' late Nusseer Khan on the throne of Khelat in the are as applicable now as then. &lt;( p re gence of the whole of the Chiefs of Beloochistan, W.

Otherwise our support would only tend to weaken not strengthen as desired. This is quite under stood even by those whose in terests make them pretend to think the contrary, and who are merely trying to get our aid to promote their ambitious objects, not the good of their country.

With reference to your letter of tlie 23rcl instant, alluding to the llth para, of my report No. 54, I Lave the honor to inform you that I have no further reasons to offer for the conclusions arrived at than my personal knowledge of Ilis Highness and the Jam of Beyla. 2. The whole tenor of my letter was to show the Jam's intention, either by intrigue or armed opposition, to upset llis Highness' Government, and I endeavoured to point out that the Jam during the past twelve months had by treasonous correspondence and armed resistance endeavoured to upset the Ivelat Government and dethrone the present Khan. 3. His Highness having by his own personal efforts subdued this Tribu tary, who for years past has done his utmost to disorganize his country and Government, would not voluntarily reinstate such a person. That tbe J am is of this opinion may be inferred, as no man having any hope or intention of returning, would have deliberately plundered his own people before seeking safety in Kurrachee. 4.

After salutations, I arrived at Bcyla on the 2nd of December, and all the principal Las- sees came to make their salaam. Sirdar Nooroodeen and the Jam of Beyla had plundered Beyla before I arrived, and have gone to Koneraj. 1 have done everything that could be done to re-assure the people ; those ■svho had fled have come back and are living peaceably in their houses, and I have promised to try and recover the property that was taken from them by the Jam and Sirdar Noordeen.

Abstract translation of a letter from Wullee Mahomed Shagassee to the address of the Commissioner in Sind, dated 'SOth Ramzan 1286 Ilizri. You are aware that I came here by order of His Highness the Khan of Ivelat to fight with Jam and Nooroodeen. I found that before my arrival Kooroodeen had gone to Wudd. I proceeded there, and Jam and Nooroodeen also came to that place with their armies to fight a battle. By the grace of God, and Majesty of His Highness the Khan, they fled by night and we obtained the victory. They left behind some guns and property, and of these I took possession. I then left Wudd for Lus Beyla, and arriving there, was informed that Jam and Nooroodeen were in Guzraj. I was going to that place to arrest them; when on the way, I was informed that the Jam had gone to Kurrachee, and Nooroodeen to Kah Saroor. It was at first my intention to go in search of Nooroodeen and make other necessary arrangements, but I learnt from a letter written by Faquir Mahomed, Naib of Kedj, that Ibrahim Khan Banpoor Wullah intended to commit mischief at Kedj. This has been his intention since one year, as you are well aware of. My wish is that I should go to Kedj. Now that the Jam is under the protection of the British Government, he should be considered to be as in that of His Highness the KZian, for both the Governments are on friendly terms with each other. As Nooroodeen was a companion of the J am, the latter should be called on to produce him. Before my arrival at Beyla, the people of that place, and Minguls, had laid waste Lus( 105 ) Beyla. From the day I arrived here, I commenced making arrangements and giving the people presents. After a few days I went to punish the Minguls, and they all submitted and made obeisance; and of the property that they had taken by force from the people^of Lus Beyla, a portion has been recovered and returned to the owners. The rest will also be returned. When I will proceed to Kedj, I will leave a small force with Ghoolam Mahomed, Naib of Jhellance, at Lus Beyla. I have written this for your information. i j (True translation) J.

The report gives details of the history of the Jam of Beylah and his antecedents explaining his opposition to the Khan; the recent movements of them against the Khan and their attempts to recruit other Sirdar's to join them.
