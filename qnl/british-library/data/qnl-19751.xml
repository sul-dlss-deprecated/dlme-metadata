Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.3,dated the 12th January,1903,regarding the proposal of certain merchants to arrange that the island of Abu Musa should be sub stituted for Lingah as a port of call.To provide against the possible contingency of the Persian Government asserting claims of sovereignty over the island,you suggest that the Chief of Shargah,whose possession it is,should be advised to fly his flag as a sign of ownership. 2. The island is in no way dependent on the Persian Govern ment,and the Government of India agree that it is desirable to take precautions to meet the advance of claims similar to those put forward in the case of the island of Sirrt.I am therefore to request G.

Tehran; With reference to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Persian Government considers these two islands as its own property, and the measures taken by the Customs Authorities in those two places have been on this account; but as I have brought to His Majesty's notice the result of the conversation I had with Your Excellency a few days ago on the subject, the Royal Command has been issued that, for the present, the measures taken by the Customs Authorities in the above mentioned places should be given up and neither party hoist flags in the two places pending the settlement of the question. Note from Sir A. E.Hardinge Gulahbk; 15 th I Yotjr Excellency, I have had the honour to receive your note of yesterday's date respecting Tamb and Abu Musa, and shall be happy to transmit to the Government of 1India any proofs with which you may favour me that the claims of the Persian Government to the ownership of these islands outweigh those of the Sheikh of Shargah. Your Excellency, however, must understand that I cannot agree to the suggestion of which I hear for the first time that the trucial Chiefs should not be permitted to replace the flag pulled down by the Persian Customs officials, and I would remind you in this connection that we have not insisted upon the Persian Government removing its flag from the island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the islands which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa. What he did was to hoist his own flag upon islands which were not formally occupied by any other Government and holds the right to fly it as the first occupant till his lawful possession of the three islands is disproved.

He suggested that, pending the discussion and decision of the question of ownership, the Arab flags should not be re-hoisted on the islands. 1 need not repeat the obvious arguments with which I replied to this conten tion, and explained the impossibility of complying with His Highness' last suggestion about the flags. I said however that I would report his remarks to Your Lordship, and that I felt sure that you would listen attentively to any reasons he might advance in support of his claim to the two islets, but I reminded him that any controversy on this subject might re-open the question of the ownership of Sirri, whose occupation by the Persians had only been tacitly, and never formally recognised by ourselves.

May, and in that now under reply, it is stated on the authority of the Darya Begi that the Chief of Shargah is erecting the buildings to which exception is taken by the Persian G-overnment. ^ yvo^ 1 submit, open to doubt whether Sh - e Sugger is really building on the ^island, but whether he is doing so or not faoJCU*** our answer to the complaint would seem to be i: ' iie same, viz:-that we have always refused to recognise Persian sovereignty over the island and that we are not disposed to listen to complaints regarding the building by Arabs of huts in which to live on an island which has always been regarded as the undou- -bted patrimony of these Arabs. The Persian G-overnment encouraged by their former success as regards Sirri Island, are evidently anxious to try to repeat the experiment in the case of Tanb, but I venture to urge that they should be distinctly warned in the sense of the latter part of Minister's Telegram Ho. 54(vide flag A, in accompanying file). Although our case with regard bo Sirri can hardly be as strong now as formerly, owing to our delay in urging the Arab claims, still it would appear that even now we could make out a strong case on the lines of Res- -idents letter Ho. 162, dated 11 June l o 04 - (vide flag B. file 668).This letter went to both Foreign and Minister, and as nothing was then done in the matter, I venture to think that Minister might be asked to refer to that letter and thus toarm himself for a(TSd) resumption.' of the argument re Sirri should the Persian Government continue to press ther their objections to the Arab occupation of Tanb.[Confidential.] No. 335, dated Bushire, the 17th (received tlie 31st) July 1905.

In continuation of my letter No. 335, dated 16th July 1905, in connection with Tamb Island, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a further telegram, dated 21st instant, received from His Majesty's Minister which has not apparent ly been repeated to India. While Sir Arthur Hardinge's Memorandum is in transit to His Majesty the Shah in Europe, nothing further can presumably be done, and I therefore address Government by post instead of telegram. 2. I wish it could have been considered possible for us to decline altogether to enter into any further discussion as to the ownership of Tamb. It is true that 1 -v 14 t r* 'I\/T r\ T\/r 1 1 O 4' lilt* O t'« ri Foreign Department endorsements No. 2672- E.A , of 17th August 1904. No. 2712 E.A., dated 20th August 1904, with enclosures. as between His Majesty's Minister and To Government of India, No^ July 1904. To Minister, No. 100, dated 15th July 1904 the Persian Government some concessiop in this direction was made by us last July, but in the communications made to the Sheikh of Shargah last year, of which copies were forwarded to the Government of India at the time with the covering 216, dated .5th letters marginally noted, he was simply in formed that the Persian Flags which had been high-handedly erected by the Direc tor-General of Customs had been removed, and that he should now re-hoist his own. It would have been fatal to have suggested to him then that the question was liable to be re-opened at any moment and that his flag might have to come down again, and it would be no less damaging to our prestige to tell him so now, and 1 venture to hope therefore that it will be decided to adopt an atti tude which will put that contingency out of the question. 3. The present and recent attitude of the Persian Government towards the question of these Islands seems to me to suggest the inference that, having achieved some success in their forward policy in regard to Sirri and Henjam, they have been encouraged to further efforts towards the extension of their juris diction and influence to other conveniently situated Islands in the Gulf. ^ lhat these aspirations are not new ones is well known to the Government of India, but I may usefully invite perusal here of paragraphs 8 to 14 of the Persian Gulf Ad ministration Report for the year 1887 to 1888 which are full of interest at the present moment. 4 The ' Persian Sirtip, Haji Ahmed Khan ' mentioned in paragraph 9 was the same individual who in earlier days figured for many years in Maskat History as Vazier to Sultan Seyyid Thuweynee. He was a native of Minab near B un der Abbas and taking service under Maskat when the Sultan held a lease of the lat ter port, he rose to a position of some prominence. On Seyyid Thuweynee s death he retired to Bunder Abbas and subsequently became the Sirtip Haji Ahmed Khan ' of whom we read here. He died comparatively recently and his son the ' Sadid-us-Sultaneh,' a man of notoriously shady character, is the pre sent Russian Consular Agent at Bunder Abbas. This individual has passed 4 or 5 months out of the 12 in Bushire, either with Monsieur Passek or away on Missions for himj to Mohammerah, Bahrein, Linsah or wherever the waters were at all troubled. While at Bushire he was constantly in the train of the Derya Begi accompanying hitn on a tour into Tan- gistan, and again on his first sea trip in April. The Derya Begim fact affected fo' complain of his parasitical presence, but whether in good faith or not, I cannot say. Monsieur Passek it will be remembered intervened both last July at the time of the Tamb and Abu Musa incidents, and again more recently when the question of the ownership of Sirri was revived as a result of the murder of a British sub ject by two of the Islanders. In this connection the Sadid-us-Sultaneh went2 down to Lingah and was ostentatiously present ^ at the execution of one of the murderers by the local authorities. c. I have troubled Government with these details in support of the opinion which I hold that the tactics now being employed by the Persian Government through the Derya Begi, in order to keep open the question of the ownership or these Islands, are prompted by the Russian Legation m Teheran and the Russian Consul-General at Bushire, assisted con a by the Sadid-us-Sultaneh, whose hereditary interest in the question has been indicated above. 6. The possession of any of the Islands in this group would so far as I am able to judge be a most useful asset in time of war; and famb Island especially seems to me to possess considerable strategic importance. It is right m the ordinary track of steamers passing up and down the Gulf, and close to the lele- graph cable. It contains hills 150 feet high on which^ guns could be mounted in commanding positions, and could easily be put in wireless and, under favour able circumstances, heliographic communication with Henjam or Ras Mus- sandum. For all these reasons it would seem important to us to take up a firm attitude towards the question of the ownership of the Island. 7. In conclusion I venture to mention for what it is worth an idea which occurs to me. I have not studied the question deeply and should not refer to it now, were it not that Sir Arthur Hardinge's Memorandum may bring the ques tion into prominence at an early date. We have in the course of the correspondence regarding these Islands, Sirri, Tamb and Abu Mussa, relied a good deal on the argument that they were the hereditary possessions of the late Arab Governors of Lingah, qua Jowasim, and that the latter, when they obtained practical sway over Lingah, came clothed with proprietary rights over these Islands which they have shared with their kins men of the Pirate Coast. See also pages 409, 410 of Curzon's ' Persia,' Volume II. Does the idea of re-installing the late joasmi Sheikh of Lingah or his son under our aegis as a Trucial Chief of these Islands on his own behalf and that of his relations of the Pirate Coast, appear to Government at all entertainable either as a basis for argument with the Persians, or as a course of practical pos- sibilitv in the event of the Persian Government showing an inclination to give us % J , , , . . • , * | | J 'V continued trouble in connection with these Islands Telegram (?)
