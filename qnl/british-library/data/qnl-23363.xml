It appears that merchants leave Bahrain for considerable periods without vacating their seats on this body. I suggest that the President should keep a book in which all members attending should sign their names as being present during a particular session and that if after a space of three sessions i.e.,6 weeks,a member is found to be continuously absent his name should be struck off and another person appointed to fill his plaoe. 3.

Memorandum:~ I forv/ard the following note for your information On the night of 29-30, Jany, 1933, the house of a Bahraani in Ged-nli was attacked by a party of three armed men. The owner of the house and his wife were inside,-the man was attacked and very seriously wounded by knife^on his wrists head and back, the wound on the back damaged the lungs. The three men are said to have seized some gold bracelets, a few rupees and a garden knife. Information was given to the police early on the following morning. One of the men was recognised by the victim as being from Rafaa, though his name was not known. After some questioning of the villagers it was discovered that the victim and his alleggd assailant had recently had a quarrel in the presence of a grass cutter from D afaa. All the grass cutters in p afee were collected and eventually the victim of the quarrel was identified and by these means the name of the assailant was dis covered. The man was said to be one Isa al-Mullah, of Hassawi origin but of Bahrain nationality, a relationof one of the gang of men implicated some years ago in a series of murders and raids on Bahama villages culminating in the attempted assassination of H. E. Shaikh Hamad. During the course of the day the accused was arrested and when his house was searched a shirt with some bloodstains was found, also a nagger and a garden knife which was identified as being the one belonging to the victim. Later the accused v/as identified by the victim and is now under arrest. Since the ocurrence the condition of the victim has improved and it is now probable that he will recover. ' 1 'he accused denied any knowledge of the victim and stated that he had never seen him before, but afterwards he admitted having had a quarrel with him saying that he had completely forgotten the incident which took place some ten days before the attack. the It has not been possible to trace hie identity of the two other men who were concerned in the affair. ** * On the night of Saturday, 28th January, a house in Jid-Hafs accidentally caught fire and a woman, a girl and two children were burnt to death. The building was stone and mud with a thached roof, the fire caught the roof which fell in blocking the one door and the people were trapped inside. There was no suggestion of foul play. r Adviser to the Government.•&gt;' —r- cl ^7 Bahrain, March 9, f 33. Dear Col. Loch, A P.W.D. overseer, a Sikh, is at present living in a house, with some of the electric department staff who are also Sikhs, which the Bahrain government rents for their use. I do not know whether you are aware of this; if he is only going to be here a week or two there is no objection to his living with the electric staff, but if he is remaining longer 1 think it would be better that he should find his own quarters or if he wishes to rent a room in a house leased by this Government for its employees he should apply officially.

The T'o-ice were brou^nt down from the Port and immediately took the matter in hand and managed to beat out the fire with sticks, they also pulled down the wood and matting round the fire to prevent its spreading further.

Sir, V z ll p 1 With reference to your despatch No.1612 of July 21st, I have the honour to inform you that I have interviewed Yusuf bin Ali el-Omran, but I find that not only are there discrepancies in the total moneys he acknowledges to have received from his father and those his father informs you that he remitted, but that the debts he has run up in addition at Beirut during the four and a half months of his stay here are so large that I hesitate to undertake payment thereof without his father T s definite permission. I enclose a statement showing these discrep ancies, as well as a detailed statement of the amount of money he states he owes here. I will endeavour to check the latter amount, but I do not anticipate much success, as the young man will have had time to prime the claimants if that were necessary. I realise that in styaing here he will add to his indebtedness, but I have warned him to go slowly, and that his debts will be closely scrutinized. According to the man 1 s own figures he has spent nearly £100 sterling in the four months or so he has been here, the sterling rate of Syrian pounds being £ Syrian 6.60 = £1 sterling. / In order The Political Agent, Bahrein .In order to cut as short as possible his further stay here, I should be grateful if, v after having submitted the statement of accounts to his father, you would telegraph me further.'

I enclose herewith for your infor mation a translation of the speech read at the opening of the Law Courts. Adviser to the Government.I thank Your Highness for opening this building which is the first building for use entirely as a Law Court which has been built in Bahrain. I thank the Political iigent, the nobility and the notables who are assem bled here for their presence on this occasion. The opening of the Law Courts is one of the many signs of the progress of this country under the wise and fortunate rule of our ruler His Highness Shaikh Hamad, Inshallah the opening of the Law Courts will be followed by improvements and developments in the adminis tration of Justice. One of the reasons for kaking this building was for the assistance and convenience of the public and to prevent the waste of time in going from place to place to where the various courts were previously situated. In future all the courts and their offices will be situated in this building which is in a central position and easy to reach from all parts. In the past the care of records has been difficult because there was no central court but now arrangements are being made to preserve the cases and to make it easier to examine old records. as you are aware for a long time a com mittee has been working on a draft Kanoon which when complete will be considered by the Government. The Kanoon is compiled from the law of Islam which is the religion of the country and from local customs and regulations. It is hoped that during this year the com mittee will complete their work. as you are aware there is a great dealV - 2 - of litigation in Bahrain and the nmuber of civil cases increased every year but in re gard to crime, Bahrain is very fortunate, there are few countries where there is so little serious crime as in Bahrain during recent years. The state of public security in Bahrain is better than in many neighbour ing countries and there are few crimes of violence. I take this opportunity to thank the Political Agents for tneir help and advice in matters of judicial administration and I thank all the Judges on courts for their service to their country and especially those persons of all nationalities who give their valuable time, freely and frequently, by sitting on the Meglis Tajara and on many special committees and who so often assist the courts as assessors or as mediators. In conclusion I thank the Government staff who have worked upon this building which will be the most handsome Government building in Bahrain. ***** R.Z.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. No. 'I fl /EL - of 1356 Office of tne Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, Shaaban 25, 1356 October 30, 1937 I have the honour to inform you that this Government have on order from Messrs. Mirrlees Bickerton &amp; Day, Limited of Hazel Grove, Nr. Stock- Port, England, through Messrs. Callender's Cable and Construction Company Limited, Hamilton House, Victoria Embankment, London, E.C. 4, a generating set, particulars of which are enclosed. 2. Owing to the present abnormal demand for steel, the suppliers have now informed us that delivery may be delayed owing to the non arrival of the crank shafts. 3. It is of the utmost importance that the set should arrive in Bahrain not later than the end of February 1938, in order that it may be ready to take the summer load. 4. Should it fail to arrive the present sets will be inadequate and there would be a grave possibility From C. Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain.- Sir, of —- 2 - of not being able to keep the supply going. 5. The consumers supplied by the Bahrain Oovemment Electricity Department include the Royal Naval Base, and their navigation lights, Imperial Airways, Limited, the Royal Air Force, Gable and Wireless, Limited, in addition to the British and other consumers in the State, and thus a shut down, or a partial failure of supply would be serious. 6 . As the suppliers inform us that the steel demand is largely due to British Govern ment re-armament requirements, I enquire whether it is possible to obtain priority to some extent by bringing Government influence to bear on the suppliers of the steel. We do not ask for a better delivery than originally quoted for by the suppliers. 7. The quantity required is small and would in no way affect the Government arrangements. 8 . I should be very grateful if the authorities concerned could be requested to assist the Bahrain Government in this matter. I have the honour to be. Sir Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.Particulars of the Generating set ordered.

V' Sir / I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of letter No. 1257 dated the 30th October 1937, from the Adviser to the Bahrain Govemnent, wh ch is self explanatory. I regret I am unable to forward copies of correspondence with the suppliers of the generating set,the facts set out in the letter having been connuni- cated verbally in London to the Bahrain State Engineer when he was on leave recently. The possible failure of the electric supply • next summer in ahrain is a truly appalling prospect and might well be followed by the practical cess tion of the activities of all Government services in Bahrain Island. - trust therefore it will be po sible to apply for the aid of His Majesty*s Government in obtaining priority ^ supply in respect of the plant required by the Bahrain Government.

Sir, I have the honour to forward two copies of a letter addressed by the Advisor to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent in Bahrain and transmitted by the latter to me . 2. The letter is self-explanatory and I have little to adduce by way of comment. The political Agent views the prospect of an eventual failure of the electric supply in Bahrain with considerable concern, and points out that such a failure might have as consequence the practical or partial cessation of Government services in the Island. 3. I would add that , at time when British interests in Bahrain are important and when a considerable capital expansion is in progress there, inability on the part of a British firm to fulfil its explicit undertaking, might2 be not only detrimental to British trade, but impolitic generally. The force of circumstances, however extenuating, would be discounted locally, were material inconvenience to ensue. 4. I have therefore the honour to request tio&amp;t you may take such action as you think fit to ensure the timely fulfilment of the Bahrain Government’s order. 5. Copies of correspondence between the Government in Bahrain and the British firm in question are not available, as the facts set out in paragraph 2 of the accompanying letter were communicated verbally to the Bahrain State Engineer when on leave recently in London I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Sgd.

Opposite to our house there is a sort of motor garage occupied by an Irani by name Abdur Heza. Of late he has converted the garage into’ a workshop £ 01 * rather 1 would say a den for all the rowdies of Bahrain, instead of repairing one car at a time, he brings about half a dozen cars and parks all round our windows and thro ws ' the rubbish of the mud guards near our windows. Krom 6 o’ clock in the morning till 10-30 p.m. in the night, not a single moment passes without either the noise of the accelerator, or the carburettor, or the electric horn, if not the singing and dancing of the rowdies. Had there been no workshop there would have been no noise at all, thR and we will be at least having some sort of sleep. The choking gas of petrol, the constant hammering of some parts of machinery, the obnoxious odour o» welding, and the stench of the rubbish thrown around our windows - all these have become a day to day nuisance and we are constrained to bring to your notice so that you may take necessary action. Many a time we have told that mechanic to repair one car at a time and not to park the cars near our windows, but he is continuing the same thing. Dr. Siddiqu* who is also living in the same street though a little bit far away, also knows this grow'ing menace. May forward to I./. for enquiry and report pi. 11-1-38. i'l-VW / &lt; /, A rr: I am not personally affected by this nuisance as I live on tlit^end of tlie soreet whiie tiie nuisance is comittcd on tiie on tne otner end. But I am an eyewitness of it and quite agree with the remarks contained in tiie application. k. Messrs Ramanatn.au f s a.nd a.*. Khan’s house is situated on ohe one end of the street and tx 4 .e garage or the so-called work shop is just opposite to it as will be shown from the following sketch marking cars, 3 or 4 of them at a time, and repairing them. As it is a public road, apafct from causing annoyance the accused is unlawfully obstructing a public way which may lead to collision with other cars coming from the corners of the streets and which, as such, constitutes a public nuisance. first is under section 1^3 Cr.P.C. by ordering ihe accused not to repeat or kommix it. The second alternative is to institute proceedings under Sections P68/290 I.P.C. and A xf A ^ -j- A]^^f7L 3. The p-ace marked X is used oy the accused for nd discomfort to the occupatns of the adjacent houses , 4. The nuisance may be remedied by two ways. The continue finefine tlie accuued. But ao it iu a long staiiding nuisance tne second metiiod seems more appropriate. As for his usiiig the garage as a workshop it does not seem probable that he will do so as tnc garage is too small for that purpose and he can only repair one car at a time which may not cause so much annoy ance. But if in future the garage proves a nuisance it may also be prohibited but that action seems pre mature yet. . /; y/sa ^ 9- ' /? / /;^ ZCf y|| | /A ^ //p ^u ,,/LT.. y~ ^ /^-&lt;£ pn- ■ £ {?U /&gt;Adviser . v ‘ill you please read the papers above? I have seen the place myself and am satisfied that the activities complained of do in fact constitute a nuisance to the neighbouring residents and must cause considerable inter ference with road traffic. I think the proper course ? if you agree, is for the Bahrain Administration to issue a prohibitory order to prevent the garage proprietor from parking in the street those cars which are under repair and from carrying out any repairs except inside his gara ge. If the prohibitory order is ignored the Police could then prosecute him in the Agency Court as he is a foreign er. k 18-1-1933.r The Adviser to the Bahrain Government presents his compliments to r e&gt; ^ and has the honour to send undermentioned documents.

We decided that it would be advisable in future to present a Memorandum of Agreement in the terms required by the Protector of Emigrants when any appointment is made. We also agreed that the present instance was one in which the Protector of Emigrants might have been more courteous but the Adviser is going to look up and see the causes of the delay and let us know. Then we can decide whether we can make any representation on the subject.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003e3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1260</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003e3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1260</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/44 I Miscellaneous correspondence with the Adviser'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1938</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-08-30T18:17:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (237 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 239; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
