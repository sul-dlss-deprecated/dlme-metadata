I find myself in rather £ peculiar position and am writing to ask if you could heir to clear matters up for me. As you know I v/as for nearly six years in External Affairs Department of the Government of India, having been given a con tract in the Indian Political Service. In July, 1946 my or here to reorganize British Government of India wrote to the they wanted to go on employing angements with me direct as from services were suddenly asked publicity. In June 1947, the Foreign Office saying that if me they would have to make ar: 15th August. The Foreign Office have, in fact, come to an arrangement with me, but I am ouite unable to find out how I stand with the Government of India. Early In August I telegraphed applying for one year’s leave rending retirement which T understood was the rroper thing to do. To 'his I received no reply and the many letters which I have since written remain unanswered. or~'cburse I' rggivsepa-overmnerrtr~offices in India are ^ in a very disturbed state. But so far as I can make out all other officers of the Indian Political Service have received some kind of notification about retirement or leave. My ease is a peculiar one - in fact it is probably unique. I am actually a regular officer of the Indian Army, having originally been lent to External Affairs Department in January 1941. Although I applied to return to the Army, I was not allowed to do so and as a kind of sop to Cerberus I was taken into the Political S&lt;=&gt;TMn cc as from March 1943. Before the transfer of power I made enquiries from E.A.D. and was told that I retired not from the Political Service, but from oT . should be the Army. have of course written to the Military Secretary’s Department, but have had no notification of my compulsory retirement as other officers have. ■* As you will realise we are rather cut off here and I should be most grateful if you could show this letter to the appropriate department in whatever is left of the India Office, and ask-■ to tteop- mo— have a iob at all, but I have seme idea of a) whether Indian Political Service __ I am, of course, lucky £0 must say I should very much like to I am being retired from the or the Indian Army, b) whether I am on leave rending retirement and if so where my leave pay comes from, and c) whether I am entitled to compensation, and if so how I arply for it. I hope you are well. I have not forgotten your valiant attempts to get me to Moscow. Yours sincerely. (Lt.-Col. G. E.

The letter dated June 25 to which he refers in the second paragraph of his letter was an express letter sent by the Department of iixtemal Affairs and Commonwealth Relations to the Secretary of State for India, reference F23(31)“4^46. A copy of that letter was sent to the Foreign Office with Mr. Harrison’s letter (Ext.1434/47) dated July 10.

Graham, Establishment and Finance Dept., Middle East Information Dept., The Foreign Office, '^idon, S.W.1. Dear Miss Graham, I should be most grateful if you could help me about ray position in Indian Government Service which is quite obscure at the moment. As you know, I was in the Indian Political Service having a contract until 1952. In a letter dated 25.6.47, of which a copy was, I believe, sent to you, I was told that if the Foreign Office wished to retain my services after August 15th, 1947, it would be necessary to make arrange ments with me direct. This gave rise to your letter of the 12th August 1947. I deduced from this that the Government of India regard me as having left their service from the 15th August, in which case I should be entitled to a) compensation for loss of career at fixed rates, b) a year*s leave pending retirement with pay of my accumulated leave and c) ray full pension after my leave is over. Although I have written and telegraphed repeatedly to India, I have had no reply and have no idea what has happened. This silence is very likely due to the disturbances and dislocation which they have been experiencing in Delhi. At the same time, I feel that there is probably seme kind of Enquiry Bureau in London where one can at least discover what one's position is and when the money due will be paid. I count myself most fortunate to be employed with the Foreign Office for otherwise I should have no means of support. You will appreciate that the loss of 5 years career with a rising salary is rather a serious matter, especially as, quite understandably, my present appointment has no security of tenure. I I wonder if you would kindly have enquiries made as to whether there is any kind of committee of adjustment or enquixy bureau in the India Office, or whatever the India Office has turned into, to which one can apply for information. I cannot even find out whether my leave pay, compensation, etc. are paid from India or from London. Yours sincerely, (sgd.) G. 3. WH33LBR.ft British Embassy, Teheran. 11th January, 1948. GW. 8 .

These proposals are fully in keeping both with Colonel 7rtieeler»s emoluments in his previous post under the Government of India and with the precedent of Mr. Savidge, the Government of India Official who was formerly en^loyed here as Director of Public Relations. (The* Director of Public Relations here is equal in rank to a First Secretary, i.e. one rank lower than that of Colonel Wheeler.) Colonel Wheeler was, moreover, seconded to his present post at the pressing request of His Majesty*s Government. I have the honour to recommend, therefore, that his proposals may be sanctioned at an early date. I am sending a dopy of this despatch to the Government of India (who have been sent a copy of my despatch under reference).

In 1943, Mr. Savidge, another officer of the Indian Political Service, was appointed Director of the Public Relations Bureau. His pay was fixed on exactly the same basis as the above and he was in addition provided with a free furnished house. As Director of the Public Relations Bureau he also had the free use of a car. In view of the greater importance and higher status of the post of Press Counsellor, I propose that my pay should be fixed as follows;- Time scale pay Rs. 1,700 Special pay 400 Overseas pay 400 k R8. Over and above this I should receive the nonnal language allowance drawn abroad by officers of the Indian Political Service who are qualified First Class Interpreters in two or more languages, namely, Rs.

Thus my total receipts will bet a) Rs. 2,650/- per month (equivalent to about £ 2,450 per annum) tax free. b) A free furnished house. c) A free car, together with a free driver and maintenance.

H.M.G. have under urgent consideration steps to he taken in Southern Persia to protect essential British interests before Tudeh party consolidate their position in Tehran and under-mine Persian'Government. Disastrous economic consequences in the U.K., India, and throughout the Empire of any cutting-off of Oil supplies from Abadan could hardly be exaggerated. 3. Apart from encouraging generous treatment of the Company's employees in order to secure that no handle is given to wanton Tudeh machinations against the A.I.O.C., H.M.G. are considering how best to frustrate political campaign fomented by the Russian controlled Tudeh party. 4. Le Rougetel is about to submit hie recommendations for a comprehensive plan of action, and when these are received we shall let you know. But the necessary ingredient in any plan of action will be a publicity campaign cone.noted from Tehran on the lines suggested in his telegram under reference, and for the purposes of this campaign he proposes immediately to expand his Public Relations Bureau. For director of expanded office H.M. Ambassador, with the enthusiastic approval of the present D.P.R.J suggests that Wheeler, of your department of Information and Arts, would be the most suitable choice. Foreign Office have appealed to me to ask you to make temporary sacrifice of his services on secondment. They recognise that he can probably be ill spared at this time, but emphasise the special efforts required to be taken to safeguard oil supplies and strategic interests vital not less to India ohan to the U.K. 5 . I very much hope therefore, that you will see your way to release Wheeler for t'his post, imp or t a no e of which requires no emphasis from me. If you agree in principle, uerms of loan can be worked out departmentally later and generous treatment can be looked for. 6„ The sooner Wheeler can reach Tehran the better. Perhaps ho might aim at arriving within a week as the Persian elections are likely to take place very shortly and there is no time to be lost,.

If effect is to be given to that policy - and we are f of course^ not pgplt clear whether a decisioxv^decision has yet been taken to adopt it - we should in any case expect that the Government pf India would be informed beforehand of H.M.G's intentions. Apart from their close concern with policy in Persia, and the fact that Indian troops are being earmarked for the defence of tba Ah nm wn^l »o India's financial share in diplomatic and consular expenditure, appropriate instructions will have to be given to the -Indian Political Service officers serving in consular posts maintained by the Government of India in Southern Persia. These officers will have an essential part to play in countering Tudeh Party activities in Persia and there is, as you may be aware, a very large Indian community among the staff employed by the A.I.O*C. at Abadan whose attitude towards the Tudeh leaders may well be of substantial, or even decisive, importance. It, therefore, seems to us that, if the Government of India's assistance is to be asked for in the matter/matter of Wheeler's services for the Tehran Public Relations Office, H.M.G. must take at least the Viceroy into their confidence to the extent of explaining the position on the lines £x/Ci3Li Afrw T^‘6 &lt;jyat£ of the attached draft telegram* Unless this \4a*-) 6'^Kjl is done, we at the India Office see nn pannlblo * chance of the ('■&gt;ovprnni&lt;ant o^-fneio consenting to let Wheeler go; and even as it is we can imagine rainirfl in fT»ir Utlhi over the ease with which the camel of fomenting UaJL disobedience to Tehran is apparently being swallowed when, up to a week ago at least, the gnat of the Bush ire Residency has occasioned so much strain/^ If you will be good enough to let me know whether a telegram on the lines of the draft enclosed can be sent, we will have it despatched and let you have Lord Wavell's reactions on receipt*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000031_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3491B</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000031</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3491B</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/85(3) ‘Persia; appointment of Col Wheeler to Tehran for publicity purposes’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1946/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-05-25T14:18:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (48 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 50; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
