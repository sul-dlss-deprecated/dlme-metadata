We have the honour to bring it to your notice that our Managing Director, in acknowledging receipt of our letter conveying the information that norma}, relations between Bahrain and jatar have been restored, comments that the time may now be considered opportune to raise the question of. boundaries between *£atar and Bahrain with the Hon'ble the Political Resident, with particular reference to the boundaries between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Development ( Qatar ) Limited, as a result of the&gt;un Company-and the ~ing a similar 1&amp;40 Oil Apreer ent between the Bahrain Petroie- Auler of Bahrain. ^spates also that he will be nak' approach to the India Office. 3. We have received no instructions to offer any comm ents on this boundary question, but we venture to point out that, in addition to the composition of the Hawar group of islands and the extent of their territorial waters which is of obvious importance to us, we believe that there are other reefs and islets between the two Bhaikhdoms outside the territorial waters of both, which constitute possible drilling locations and on which Bahrain cairns appeared about 1S39/40. 4. We should be interested to hear if .these cairns are recognised by ILh.G-1 as constituting ownership and whether star’s claims or interests ,were taken into consideration at the time of denarnation. 5.

I confess that I would prefer not to have had the question raised at all at tie present time as I amfparticularly anxious not to disturb the very recent resumption of friendly relations by raising a further question of urisdiction over islets lying between the two countries. However, since the matter is being raised in London in any case according to paragraph 2 of your letter No. Q/BA.2/3825 of the 30th September there does not seem to be any objection to clearing up certain minor points here without necessarily making any direct reference to the Rulers concerned.» 3.

In answer to your questions below - (1) In 1939 when the Hawar Islands were allotted to Bahrein no decision seems to have been reached on the boundary question (PZ 1227/40). (2) The Agreement between the Sheikhs of 17th o une, 19^f4j mentions Zubarah but contains no reference to Hawar (Bxt ,342VVf). (3) In W Sir Geoffrey Prior suggested that the 1939 decision was unfair to Qatar but did not feel that it was practical politics to reverse it (Bxt .7330/41). Sir Olaf Caroe agreed that the decision should stand (Ext.. 8143/41) * During his conversation with the Sheikh of Bahrein on 9th December last the Political Resident told him that views on this would probably not agree with his t} (Ext. 6867 / 4 $). In a letter to Sir Olaf Caroe dated 24th January, however, he said that he did not think it would be practical politics to get Bahrein to give up anything on the Hawar Islands (Ext. 1054/44). (4) There does not seem to be any explanation for the Bahrein Petroleum Company*s attitude, the last we appear to have heard about it was a note in a Bahrein Diaiy for October 1942 which said that they had agreed to postpone indefinitely their drilling programme on or near Hawar.

Esq., Iraq petroleum Co., Ltd., Ling Hoiiae, / Dominion Street, /-» OCOPY. J j Ling House, Dominion, Street’, Lon ion, EM. 2. 23rd June,'1944, Dear Mr. Bridgeman, Referring to your letter of the 19th June, 1914 regarding certain matters raised by the Petroleum Administrator for War on the Scheme for the reopening of operations and development of the Qatar Oil Field, the Scheme for the production of 20,000 barrels per day was based upon the production and geological data available from the results of two wells drilled prior to the closing down of operations in 1942. Although my Groups are prepared to consider increasing the Scheme to provide up to 50,000 barrels per day, they would wish to assure themselves that the Qatar structure can sustain such a production, which could only be ascertained by the drilling of a larger number of wells than those which have furnished the information available at the present time. As regards the provision of refining capacity to handle the production of Qatar, whether 20,000 or a larger quantity up to 50,000 barrels per day, I am not sure that we are free to submit a scheme until the question of the provision of such facilities has been discussed with the appropriate Departments of H.M.G., in accordance with the provisions of the Agreements dated the 5th June, 1935 and the 5th February, 1937, between H.M.G. and Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Ltd. (the original holders of the Qatar Concession) and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. (on behalf of its subsidiary petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd.) respectively. Under these Agreements, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. has undertaken, subject to commercial considerations, to consult with H.M.G. as to the site, capacity, etc. of a refinery to handle crude oil produced from Qatar. I propose to initiate enquiries with H.M.G. on this matter with a view to ascertaining their intentions. Yours sincerely, J. SKLIROS•MINISTRY OF FIT FT,' ^ p c POWER.

Consideration is now being given to the question of the best location for this additional capacity, and in this connection we are reviewing the various develop ment schemes which have already been put forward. The Qatar development scheme for the production of 20,000 bbls of crude oil per day has, as you are aware, been approved in principle by the Oil Control- Board and is one of the projects now nossibility of extending this scheme 25,000 or 50,000 barrels per day has under to q 1 « n review.

There is no necessity to call for a repetition as the meaning is clear enough for present purposes. The first portion, regarding an agreement between H.M.G. and the Ruler, obviously refers to Qatar and presumably we shall hear from you in due course on this matter. The remainder of the telegram refers to instructions sent by us to racker regarding our Agreements with the Shaikh of Ajman and the Sultan of Oman and Dhofar. The Ajman Agreement, which gives us survey and exploration rights only, expires in March, 1944 and we instructed Packer to endeavour to obtain an extension of the existing Agreement for a period expiring five years after the conclusion of an Armistice between Great Britain and Germany and Japan, whichever shall be the later, on the grounds that our operations have been interrupted by reasons beyond our control. If, however, the Political Resident does not favour such an approach, we gave Packer instmictions as to the terms which he was authorised to offer the Shaikh for a 75 year Concession in exercise of our right under Article 3 of the existing Agreement. Either of these alternative settlements are acceptable to us but we considered that the first alternative might be preferred by the Political Resident who might not wish to have negotiations for an Oil Concession opened at the present time in the Persian Gulf area. As regards Oman and Dhofar, we are prepared to accept either an extension of the ’option’ period or to take up the Concession in^ accordance with its terms,. Here again, we feel that the interruption P.A.IC. Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, 8.

One cause ot complaint they hud already given to the newspapers—the alleged lailure to use the petroleum of the Middle East to ease the heavy burden on United States reserves —but this has provoked the deputy petro leum administrator, Mr. Ralph Davies, to make a corrective *statement to-day. “The british are being put in a very un fair light,” he said. “The sole controlling factor.’in the full use of oil reserves for the battlefield has been the tanker situaCon.” Mr. Davies explained that when the number of tankers was limited it was necessary to move oil *from the sources nearest to the point of demand, and that the shortest distance to the European theatre of war had been from the United States and the Caribbean area. Until the Mediterranean was opened to United Nations traffic it would have been neces sary to haul Persian oil all the way round Africa, a much longer voyage than that from the United States. Since the open ing of the Mediterranean more oil had been drawn from the Persian Gulf, “and substantial relief has already been felt.” “ Contrary to the general impression,” Mr. Davies went on, “ much of the oil in South America is British-owned, and we ought to remember that, on the other side of the picture, Americans have a stake in the oil deposits of the eastern' hemisphere. This, too, is con trary to the idea which people have that the resetves of the Persian Gulf are entirely in British hands. American holdings in the Middle East are very large and are almost |comparable with British holdings in the same ^area.” SITUATION IN HAND The President at his Press conference to-day made available a report from competent American authorities on the subject of American and Middle East oil, which was an elaboration of what Mr. Davies had said. When its contents had been heard Mr. Roose velt said that in other words the scare had proved not to be a scare; the situation was well in hand. There is the subject also of merchant shipping in the post-war world, on which Admiral Howard Vickery may have conveyed an erroneous impression in what he said to the Press yesterday after his visit to Great Britain. He had been asked there, he said, what the United States intended to do with its merchant fleet after the war, and he had replied that “ we intended to become and to stay a maritime nation ” and “ would do it by cooperation, but if they did not want to cooperate we would stay one, anyhow.” The Admiral described his auditors as.“ somewhat shocked by his bluntness.” What he said, and the way in which he said it, is likely to convey the idea to many Americans that the British had assumed that this country would scrap its merchant fleet when the war was over. : -— ,, x .

It goes without saying that anti-British and anti-Russian speeches will be made; while It is under debate, and this would b*e true no matter how long Senator; Connally's committee waited before act- : ing and no matter how generalized—or, in fact, how anodyne—their formula proved to be. A BURNING ISSUE But it is a fair question, and many Ameri cans are asking it, whether a full-dress debate in' the Senate on the foreign policy of the United States is not overdue. That august body, which shares treaty-making power with the President, has had nothing of the kind since this country entered the war; and through all this time the issue has been burn- ingly under discussion outside the walls of the Capitol. In short, say the critics, the Senate, which has constitutional power, is shrinking from the acceptance of responsibility which goes with that power. What te wrong with the Fulbright resolution, they ask ? “ No re phrasing.” says the New York Times to-day. “ no shuffling about of commas ” would be important enough to offset the harm that would now be done by changing it. Three of the five Senators who have made a 40.000-mile voyage about the world are in Washington again, and when they saw the Press representatives they indicated clearly enough that their observations had shown that American diplomatic and economic activity was falling behind that of the British. Accord ing to the Associated Press, they intend to tell the executive session, of the Senate that American representatives abroad are “ at a loss to know what this nation's attitude Willi be on many important questions when the fighting is over.” They made it clear that they intend to demand of Congress that action should he taken to safeguard the immediate and post-war interests of the United States!/ in relation to aviation and petroleum reserves. \ Senator Russell said he thought that post war arrangements should be made “ right now, while the lend-lease baUmce K so favourable i to us. Senator Brewster, however, did not think the “ mere present existence of a favour able balance would help. It was rather I now, “ while there is a prospect of increased lend-leasc. the United States would get a! favourable hearing in negotiations.” BURDEN ON OILFIELDS q, AU three agreed that these negotiations! s.iould cover the future status of airlieUl- buib m other countries with lend-lease funds atWi that there should be an arrangement for the] reisian Gulf area to take over oart of the load now carried by ihe oilfields of the United H po 1 ssesses on| V 25 per Cent, of the world s petroleum reserves but is ” supply- mg 6 5 per cent, of the oil used for the war ”| “ at , Roes or1 ' sa'd Senator Brewster t and we have another war in 10 or 15 years wc may have to go out with a tin dipper and ask somebody for oil.” Gne of the minor', or perhaps major, annoy-U ances oi these travellers w.s tS discovery * ol the degree to which the reporting of American military activities in some areas was m the hands of British news and radio services Ihis aroused a suspicion that these activities were being plaved down.” When the RAF made a sortie, said Senator Russell, it' was always mentioned by name, but when American bombers went into action the results were! always attributed to ” allied air forces.” T it is no use replying to ilm with a ntauouu^l which might easily be done, for the American I less is strongly and understandably nationalistj m us reporting.

You will now doubtless have seen the Political Residents telegram No* T/820 of the September, /confirming that the statement is intended to be substituted for paragraph 3 of the proposed agreement with the Sheikh. Our own (r 6* tj&amp;A. viewfis that the suspension of operations is A definitely covered by Article 15 °f the Qatar Oil Concessio^ and that it is therefore not altogether satisfactory to^/qualify this in ary way. On the other hand it hardly appears likely that if the latest version of the Sheikh*s statement were inserted as paragraph 3 of the new agreements this would be likely to operate at a later date in any way to the Company^ disadvantage. An/ j *I n A r ' : f Your letter Ho. C/675 of 1943. dated iSth km 1943. has been received and 1 have noted what you say about the state ment which the ompany wish to be followed after they have stopped their operations. 0* Political Agent, at the beginning of the discussions about this matter I agreed to what you wanted in order to comply with your wishes and not because the Company were justified in stopping their operations. I explained this to you in ity letter dated 8th ihaban 1361 (21-8-42) where I said ’’when you yourself saw Article 15 of the Agreement, during our conversation, and when you perused the provisions of the said Article and asked me not to demand a rigid application owing to the present circumstances I could not stick to the terms of the Article but acquiesced to your request and fell in with your wishes in the matter of according facilities leaving aside the provisions of the above article 51 * In my letter of 8th Shaban 1361 (21-8-42) and my letter dated 26th Jemad ul Than! 1361 (11-7-42) I said nothing to you except in good faith and to meet your wishes although I saw no real causd which justified the cessation of the Company's operation© under the terms of the Article in the Concession Agreement dealing with this point. 0* Political / gent, I assure you that when I discuss with you any of these points I have nothing in my mind except sincerity and good faith , though in such matters one must be cautious so that later i on no misunderstanding may take place about any article ! which is phrased in ambiguous terms. It is this reason which has caused me to make a reference to you regarding the statement which you sent me about the Company. I thank you very much for agreeing with me that the three obligatory concession payments are fundamental and obligatory, and that t hey should not be included among other secondary matters. I appreciate your attention in this matter. As regards what you say about 'force majeure*, if I raised objection to this phrase it is because I wait to , avoid misunderstanding• It is not wise that the matter ! should be left unclarified for It is possible that the \ Company might take unfair advantage of this. I therefore ^ raised objection to the woi*ding of this phrase, because “force majeure' appeared in the Concession Agreement in accordance with the method of agreements. It is better that the wording should be the same now as it was in the agreement, i.e. '*The Company should carry out their under takings, unless occurrences of 'force majeure* take place and stop the operations. Occurrences of 'force mrjeure' which prevent the Company from carrying out their undar- /takings mean those which occur injhs^Company*s operations at ( star and nothing else must be taken into consideration or be used by the Company as an argument 11 • If I have point ed this Cut it is only as a safeguard; otherwise I and the Company will, Insha Allah, base our relations on truth, v sincerity and good faith for the strengthening and growth of our mutual interests. j Ad regards what you say about the last sentence of ^ \ the statement, I did not vrite anything which signiriedo that I was convinced that there was real cause to justify * 1 ■ \ the /- i ‘ i,*1 'ti rr r , &lt; ;• kJ - 2 / S&lt;? J the Coiapany stopping their operations,,, M regards your reference to what I said in tsy letter of 26th Jaraad ul rhani 1361 (11-7-42), it does not, in any way, convey the meaning you au gest. I assure you that what I wrote in letters of 26th Jamd ul rhani and 8th Shaban 1361 is exactly what I mean, and 1 wrote those letters with sincerity and good faith. If you refer to my letters in question, from which you quoted extracts that suited you, you will find thut my meaning .^^not as you have now explained, but you have misinterpreted what I wrote. In my letter of 26th Jamad ul Thani 1361, at the beginning of the paragraph from \fr ich you quoted, I said f, You observed during our conversation in this connection, when you read Article lb of the Agreement, that there was no provision in that Agreement relating to this matter. Yut you directed my attention to the point of view of His Majesty’s lovern- ment in this matter”. If you read the following phrase, it will be clear to you what I really meant, a meaning which cannot escape you. ”And I found some justification in what you said”, and later, taking into consideration existing conditions, 1 said {t There is no ambiguity in it”. I meant that I agree to your wishes and those of your Government only. 0* Political Agent, how do you want me now to change the meaning of what I have said and agree to the view point of the Company about the stoppage of their operations ? If what I said in ay letters to you satisfies you and the Company, well and good. Please refer to the second paragraph of the same letter where you will find that I said f, Ir I reply to Your Honour’s request on the point mentioned above my reply will be restricted to one matter only”. This paragraph is clear and every one can understand its meaning and to what it refers. I wonder O’ Political /gent how this paragraph which is contained In the same letter escapes you, and you quote certain words the meaning of which is clear whep they are connected with the preceding ones* 1 am sure that a person of your quali ties fully understands what I really mean* The last sen tence of ay letter dated 26th JifliSfl ul Thanl 1361 (11-7-42) is, however, connected with the preceding one in which I said,' ”1 explained everything to you during get conversation and made the matter fully clear to you. xf you can assure me that all that I have said - and it is an unambiguous right - will be carried out, it ean then be said that there is justification for what you told me verbally.” 1 still affirm what I said previously. &lt; hat I said to you is clear and what you said to me verbally is what I have explained, namely, you only expressed your wish and that of the 'Govern ment, whereas I said that as far as the Company were con cerned there was no real justification for them to stop their operations* If, however, what I said to you is carried out, then it can be said that thei'e is justification takin into consideration your point of view and wish. Youare not the same as the Company* How do you wish me to agree to the paragraph which has been framed in the state ment in this connection ? I am sura that if you will tninx over the matter you will realise that I was justified In what I have said. Usual Gnding. \ mmi ,w^ ^ $4uM+yt '^ c iZ ‘If . 0 ^ g *- kt Xf it is the intention to insist on our interpretation of Article 15 and on its strict application hereafter, I do not much like this correspondence. If, however, the course thus initiated is to be adhered to and something which the Sheikh appears likely to accept is to be said, either orally or in writing, I agree that the fonaula 'in deference to etc. etc.' is probably preferable to the original. But I am inclined to agree wih what I gather is Sir Leonard Wakely's view that there was a certain weakness and lack of conviction involved in the Political Agent’s letter to the Sheikh,dated the 29th March 1943 with its enclosed draft agreement. Having regard to the fact^apparent from the instructions conmunicated in paragraph 5 of the Secretary of State’s telegram No. 10901 of the 18th June 1942^that the Company suspended operations on the direct orders of H.M.G. - orders which, I presume, could, and in the circumstances would, have been strictly enforced had there been any inclination to disobey - and the further fact,apparent from the Political Resident’s telegram No. 1303 of the 6th July 1942^that the Sheikh had been specifically informed of the orders thus given, and of the carrying out thereof by the Company, I cannot quite understand how the Sheikh was allowed to assert, without being corrected, in his letter to the Political Agent dated the l6th April 1943&gt; that he did not admit the existence of reasons justifying the suspension, and that the Company (and the Sheikh himself?) had in fact only been asked to suspend operations. It would therefore appear , in fact, somewhat unnecessary for the Company to base their action on anything else than force majeure within the meaning of Article 15* But however weak and unnecessary it may be^in view of the terns of that Article,to ask the Sheikh to 'agree' to the suspension of operations 'in deference to H.M.G.’s wishes', it is, I think, distinctly preferable to asking him to accept the point of view that the suspension was 'justified having regard to the conditions caused by the war' - which might well be read as an admission that a situation not covered by the Article was being provided for.

On further consideration it has occurred to us that the statement of the Sheikh rex erred. 00 in the last part of paragraph 1 of the Political Resident’s telegram No* 1615 is not intended uO oe an oral statement, but to be substituted a.or paragraph 3 of the new agreement covering the period of suspension which the Political Agent has been negotiating with the Sheikh. If so uhxs would seem to us definitely preferable to the original form of paragraph 3? since the earlier form mi^ht possibly be held to compromise the view on which we are agreed that suspension was in any case justified under Article 15.

Petroleum Development (Qatarp Ltd. &gt;a&lt;f Paragraph 5 of that telegram asked, the Political Reside/ to obtain the Sheikh's written recognition of the state of interruption of the Company's operations. ihe past year has been occupied by ©omuunioatiefi®. between the Sheikh and the Political Agent at Bahrein, on behalf of the Company, with regard to various minor services etc. which the former insisted that the Company should continue to perform (e.g. payment of the salaries of various Qatari officials and guards, and the provision of a weekly *aail service to Bahrein and a bi-monthly camel service to the Company's camp). The Company have now reached provisional agreement with the Sheikh as to the undertaking^ to be given with regard to these matters. The Political Resident's telegram no. 1615 of July 23rd states that the Sheilh of Q&amp;tar^ is averse from giving the written recognition which, as described above, it is desired to obtain from him; and that the most he will say is that in deference to the wishes of he agrees to the suspension of the Company's operations subject to the fulfilment of the above mentioned undertakings. The Political Resident refers to paragraph M of our telegram no. 10901, which in effect said that the Coixpany would have a case under article 15 of their concession^for pleading that the suspension of their operations was due to force majeure; and he says that in these circumstances it seems unnecessary to press the Sheika for recbgnition in more specific terms. * We referred the Political Resident's telegram to the Petroleum Department, stating that we -were disposed to agree with him. The Petroleum Department share this view and say that the Compary also agree. They rfShke two further points, however:- (a) They question whether the Compary is in fact covered by article 15 of their concession. The^ circumstances in which paragraph M of our telegram no. 10901 was drafted are “described in the M.S. note at the foot of the submission of 16th June, 194-2, and in the second paragraphin return for an acceptance by the Sheikh of the point of view that the suspension of operations was justified. But the Resident 1 s telegram of the 23rd July is not very lucid, and I do not; feel altogether happy about expressing agreement with it, or undertaking to advise the Company, without having seen the papers to which the telegram refers or being cleareras to the exact nature of the proposal. - * ~ 4 -- ed (and perhaps everyone else — — ^**&gt; 0 ^*. Perhaps it is, and if so I should feel that nothing much would be given away by accepting the position. But in the light of the papers below, is it not possible (l should have thought probable) that what is contemplated is a written record of agreement in the new form in place of the formula in paragraph 3 of the draft above referred to, i.e. a ‘written recognition of the state of interruption of operations 1 , though not the recognition that was desired? If this were so, the matter would perhaps require more consideration. Would it not be in effect something like an admission that the cessation of work was not covered by Article 15 of the concession, and that it is now accordingly [ to be covered by this new agreement? And could we in that case agree without qualification with the Residents assumption Would it not be desirable in any case to await the arrival of the papers referred to, which may make the position clearer? They should presumably arrive very shortly? view that what is proposed is an * k ^ c that the Company are still protected by Article 15?* Perhaps there is nothing in this; and it would not seem to matter much for practical purposes if the Company are satisfied to rest on the new agreement. But I feel that wg ought to be clearer on these points before taking the responsibility of advising them.v To: Ext.4713/43, DRAFT TELEGRAM From: Secretary of* State Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, repeated to Government of India, External Affairs Department and Political Agent, Bahrein.

We are not however, altogether certain whether, as stated in ^Sfragraph 2 of the Political Residents telegram, the Company is in fact covered by Article 15 of their concession since this Article reads 'that which occurs in connection with the Company* s operations in Qatar and nothing else must be used by the Company as an argument in this respect.' While there are no drilling obligations under Article 3 the Company is bound to 'explore the State of Qatar minutely by any methods which are the best in its opinion to enable it to ascertain the probable existence of the substances'.

I thank you for the interest you have been taking in the matter and appreciate your good attention in it. I hope, as you are hoping, that inshallah no misunderstanding would arise and that matters will go on with good and clear intention and in an atmosphere filled with satisfaction and sincerity. But it is imperative that one should realize what would result from some of the phrases if they are framed in such a way that unexpected or unforeseen possibilities may arise. For this purpose you have kindly asked me to see the statement attached to your letter and say whether it is correct or whether there is any error in it. This attention deserves thanks and appreciation. X say that the statement contains some points which I am not in a position to consider correct, so I therefore place before you my remarks concerning them. In this statement the annual payment has been included and connected with some meanings. As jrou know these are obliga tory payments which, whatever hapj^ns, must be paid by the Company at their due time for the 'preservation of the concess ion conditions, and they should not be connected with other secondary things, and also the monthly payments to the Representatives will be under the same procedure. There remain A the other questions which X discussed with you in the past and which were referred to in your previous letters and in your above statement. ^There is ambiguity in some of the sentences of the statemenijwhiah I would like to be clarified. In the statement it is said n The Company undertake to carry out what is mentioned (therein) unless they are prevented from doing so by force majeure. 11 I cannot say that this is correct because I do not know exactly the meaning of rt force majeure. M It might hapoen that for the most trivial cause the Company will plead 'force majeure.' This sentence must be corrected with a meaning more simple and clear, about which there will be no ambiguity. And also the last sentence regarding the justification of the point of view of the Company for the suspension of their operations at present. I do not admit this because reasons to justify the suspension of the Company’s operations, as stated in the agreement, have not so far taken place, but you have only asked for that (? suspension of the operations) and you have done it as per the letters previously exchanged between us in this matter. I therefore cannot say that the statement, which you have sent, is correct as it is which please note. U.EAny reply to be addressed :— The Secretary. Telephone: Abbey 7000.

Your Honour doubtlessly remember the conversation which took place between us concerning this matter on the 2rui and 3rd JUly 1942. V^hm you referred to Article IB of the agreement I explained to you that if we were to observe the said article .* we would not find anything in it now bearing on the suspension of the Company’s operations* As you have noticed the said Article refers to the !1 feres laajeure” that might take place in Qatar but says nothing about whet may happen in other places. You will sea that no ’force majeurc* has taken place in Qatar necessitating the suspension of the Company* s operations. It can be known from the agreement itself what is to be done should the Company stop their operations and thus act in contravention witli the provisions of Article 15 of the agreement. then you yourself, during our conversation! perused the provisions of the said Article and asked mo not to demand a rigid application owing to the present circumstances 1 could not © tick to the terms of the Article but acquiesced in your request and fell in with your wishes in the matter of according facilities leaving aside the provisions of the above article* But I explained to you that I will lodB »ny things ©a account of this and stipulated that the things which I mentioned in my conversation should be granted and then I confi , .in my letter of 2€th Jamah thmni 1361 (9/0/42)* You promised to take up the matter with the Company end do your best in getting them* I thank you for discussing the matter with the Company md have no doubt that 1 will easily get all the things X mentioned in view of the great facilities which 1 have afforded to the Company and ^ cooperation with them which has facilitated their work* ’During our conversation X informed you that among the MmUtama and facilities which I afforded to the Company was that X allowedto Xaod. thdir* iBat^Fl&amp;Xs @t ^Ikj*it ^ wliix© according to tho ©groeaent should have landed Vttm at Doha* In. doing so I wanted to &amp;f;ke aattars aasior for the Company as J was mjro that the Company will appreciate it* Secondly * uagtl to 011 th ®I r own BtBtmmit regarding the articles which they have Imported at sikrit such m provisions, drinks, clothings and every dutiable thing and I did not set up a. department to check these 'things and recorded number mid kind for the purpose of imposing duty on them a® is done in all othjr places* This is besides the cooperation and other numerous facilities which I had afforded them* In spite of all this if the Company did a trifle thing, which they are bound to do by reason® of mi teal cooperation, they consider it a favour as they say about such a small matter as the mail* I do not deny the Company * ® cooperation with me, and appreciate the facilities rendered by them which is in cumbent upon the parties who are working for their mutual benefit, but I am sorry to notice that the Company is con sidering the mutual assistance as a favour by them, disre garding the assistance given by me to them* I hops that the wise Manager of the Company will realise this m he is a man of excellent character* Although I have already ex pressed to you «y gratitude and appreciation for the serious interest you are taking in this matter I have already ex plained to you that the suspension of the Company 1 s operation® will be m hard blow on s large number of my subjects most of whom are .poor end are dependent on the Company* s work for their livelihood* There is no doubt th^t their deprivation and of their work will have a bad effect on them/as I have stated will causa a great deal of unemployment* In spite of this I have to comply with your request to amopthen matter® for the Company m usual, but at the same time it is the duty of the Company to be lenient with us, as we have been to them, and realise© according to Justice that neither my demands-3~ demands are nm nor are they wanted from them as a favour bUt aOSt ° f UiM ar ° btln « oarrletl out aocording to agreement, sr ive i at between me and the Company's Sanager. Theee agreomsnta have nothing to do with the conceuslon agreement, but were made later as a result of discussions between me and the Manager and 1 considered them as right, which cannot be welved. In my conversation with you 1 explained to you that it is necessary that they should remain as before. I have to thank you on this occasion for explaining what I had said to you to the Company • You stated in your X&amp;ti^p that the Compary hm® agreed to some of the demands and we are nm nearing m understanding* I hops that the Company t through - your mediation, will agree to the ©the r matters as they are of no Importance* (1) The Company has agreed to continue GuIWsa payment of the pay of the Director of/Zlkrit, the guide and 'the Guard Commander f but thought ©f reducing the number of the guards to 15* It la not possible for mm to agree to this as it is one of the most important and necessary matters* Article IX states that there should be *sufficient guards* and X see that the present number of guards is not sufficient as the camp is far mm*# from the town and it is very Important that it should be well protected* It is evident that more care should be given for the protection of the place than the r time whan it is occupied by it® staff and employees* You will naturally realise this point and I therefore find that no adequate and proper protection can be ensured with less than the present number of guards* It is my concern to fix the number of guards as I know what number is sufficient, so there is no reason to reduce it* This is one of the demands which I ®m not going to give up? the number of guards should remain as it was. (2) The Company has agreed to continue to pey the rent of the house, and the o&amp;lary of one guard for It, but refused to keep servsmts In it* I concur with the Company in their views and admit that the question of the servants is their concern, but it would ba bettor ifif they keep one ©erwit for their own pur^oao, otherwise the question of the a erven to concerns them only. (3) The question of coMunications is one of the *r*o©t important and vital matters. It is necessary that comniunicatione should be maintained between ae and the Company’s officials and that the mall should continue as before* This has to be arranged, and it is not difficult for* the Company to arrange it. I admit that this matter is one of the facilities which the Company is making for m in such circumstances and which I appreciate and shall not forget. It is not necessary that the mail ahonld be carried by the Company’s launches as many other means of transport arc available such as small launches f etc. I, on my side, find th«t the continuance of the mall is necessary even once a week and I agree to take delivery of it at ^ekrit whence it will be sent to Doha by camel or other means of conveyance. The object is that the mail should reach Ztkrtt every week. I do not agree that the mail should be carried once a month, as you have mentioned and I do not consider that the Company will be giving me a facility in this matter $ ® s they are already bound to send me the monthly payments and naturally have to sand the mail with it every month. In this the Company will not be c©~operating with or assisting me, but if thsy moke arrangements for ©ending the mail weekly, I deem it as an act of facility by them, and value their assistance. I, therefore, hope that arrangement* for the carriage of mill weekly, as stated by me, will ba made m&amp; handed over to my representative mt Zikrit who will arrange for its transmission to me. &lt;4) A&amp; regards the coasamioationa between Dukhan and Doha, as it has been my habit to amoothen matters for the Company I agree with the Company’ a proposal* (a) The question | of payments concerning the Concession remains. Ton are aware j : that the payments of the Concession by the Company are my rights end this Company will not be released from their liahill’ except by payment of the rights to the person entitled to it. Thera is no provision in the agreement making it nacesaof the Aerwunont. :*he payment should therefore be mads accord, ing to my wiah otherwlee the Company will not be released fro® their liability. I think that you will realise that it is my right which I have not exceeded a bit and the Company must pity ay duee in silver rupees. It is for them to arrange obtain thas® coins* (6) a&amp; regards th# Company* b stats- ®.©nt to you in their luttsr in which th^y- alleged that they have now agreed to give facility. You will understand from oar conversation and from whet I stated in my previous and pres ant letter® that Most of my demand® are clear rights of mine and there ia nothing in the® which can be considered as facility or assistance. However I have to submit to your wishes and hope that all will be carried out properly during the period of the suspension of the Company* &amp; operations md should not be stopped except by 'force m&amp;J mr$* which isafcea it impossible to carry them out. When the state of affairs returned to the normal condition the previous operations have to re*start and proceed according t© the necessities of work and exigencies of circum stances. (?) 1 hope that you have realised that I understand the present situation vary well and did my best to afford fac ilities, and that the Company have not given me great concess ions as you, have Imagined in matters which I have been carrying out. You know that I bm not making such requests taking opportunity of the present situation, but gme up mmy things In response to your wiah. I do not want anything new from the Company, but most of these had already bmn agreed upon between us $nd it is not possible to give them up without a otkeX reasonable cause. 1 gave upjmre important matters than these because I found that your requests are reasonable* I afforded facilities #.nd acted in good faith and hope that good faith .^Hj | be the object of all of u® in our work and movement® which is better for the security and promotion of mutual interests# U.K.1 0 Ext.6003/42.

After discussion with Company it has been decided that, owing to isolated position of Qatar and difficulty of maintaining on spot adequate staff to ensure permanent destruction of wells at short notice, wells should be permanently plugged forthwith. Necessary orders will be issued to Company’s representatives by C, in C. Middle East through you, 2. There is no concessionary obligation to drill but Company expect that Sheikh will show displeasure- at their. suspension of drilling operations as Article 3 of Concession requires them to explore area minutely for -purpose of discovering oil* 3* Qatar has been fully explored geologically' and no additional work of that nature can be offered as substitute in furtherance oi object of Concession which is discovery and exploitation of oil, and which can be accomplished only by drilling, - 4* Article 15 of Concession recognises delay in operations occasioned by force majeure occurring in connection with Company’s operations in Qatar. This would appear to cover suspension ot operations on orders from His Majesty’s Government, In these circumstances it is suggested that in order to safeguard -mpany’s interests Sheikh should be informed that for reasons connected th the war effort His Majesty’s Government have ordered Company mporarily to suspend operations, . These will be soon,^ world conditions are more propitious, * In order to avciu pos ture trouble between Company and Sheikh it night also be ^sirabxe obtain from him his written recognition of the state oi interrup Company’s operations.

The Shaikh seemed surprised at the idea of any tax being taken from these employees and said that no taxes were being taken from them as far as he knew. After he left the room however the Indian doctor of P.C.L., who attends the Shaikh and who was with ms at the time, t old me that the Shaikh did not know about these taxes which were being taken by his son Hamad, without his know- ledge« 3. In the absence of the shaikh I asked Shaikh Hamad as to whether he was taxing these men and, after some hesitation, he rather defiantly said that they were being taxed but that all other countries did the same and in fact charged more. I pointed out that in Bahrain there are no impositions on employees of the Company there. He said that he knew nothing about Bahrain but that in -Iraq employees had to pay various fees. I said that these qataris are poor men and that it was a pity that they should be heavily taxed in this way. The Company v/ae only just starting and that such methods were likely to hinder its work and thus cause loss both to the Shaikh and the Company. 3. Shaikh Hamad appears however to be a grasping, ignorant -oi t o,. man an^ it is unlikely that any arguments will affect him. He is also said to be under the influence of Abdullah bin Barwisha bird of the same feather, only more astute, une excuse v/as that evil residents of latar are subject to taxation and that these Qataris employed by P.O.L, are in the same category, but this is not correct as while the average Qatari only pays ordinary Zakat, Customs, etc., Company employees ^Qataris) have to pay from Rs.3/- to Rs,5/- per mensem per head accord: ng to their pay. 6. Nothing was aaid about taxation of foreign employees of the Company, vide correspondence ending with your telegram No. 19 dated the 4th January 1941, to H.M.Secretary of State for India. sd* R.G.Alban.

HORSHAM , which states: ’’from your first memorandum, we gathered that the coiapany wisheu actively to oppose TAXATION of employees (Q ATARIS or FOREIGNERS ) and not merely to avoid becoming involved in the method of collection. ’’The situation now is that the SHAIKH taxes QATARI employees but has given up the idea of obtaining COMPANY'S assistance in the collection. He has seen the danger of referring the matter any further to the company, and wishes to avoid any intervention by the POLITICAL AGENT. It is most unlikely that he will now attempt to tax FOREIGNERS . ”It, therefore, follows (reference PC 30/1) that the SHAIKH will not raise the question of TAXES again and the COMPANY will not have the^ opportunity of taking up the attitude that the whole scheme is outside the terms of the CONCESSION and the matter must be referred, to the POLITICAL AGENT. ’’Meanwhile, the SHAIKH, leaving out COMPANY co-operation, will complete his organization to TAX all COMP A NY QA T ARI EMPLOYEES . • 'We presume that we can take it that the COMPANY does not wish to take ROOM (or Department) TABLE K.

(ii) On the 6 th February 1941, I visited the Zekrit Headquarters of Petroleum Concessions Limited in qatar. I was entertained by Mr. Ensor, the Senior representative on the spot. Afterwards I proceeded to Riyan where I was entertained by Shaikh Abdullah oin Easim. Shaikh Abdullah had with him Shaikh Hamad his son, and Saleh el Mana, his secretary and Adviser. Abdullah bin Darweesh was also seen at Zekrit. Shaikh Abdullah seemed to be in exceptionally good health. He had Just come in from his desert camp. The opportunity was taken of conveying to him the greetings of Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa, Ruler of Bahrain, which he returned with every show of cordiality, although at the same time expressing regret at the present state of strained relations between the two Shaikhdoms, which was attributed to the fault of ’’others”. The opportunity was taken of speaking to the Shaikh on the taxes levied by his son on Qatari employees of Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Shaikh apparently knew nothing of this. When he had gone out of the room, it was explained to me by the Indian doctor of Petroleum Concessions Limited that taxes were levied by Shaikh Hamad, the son, without the knowledge of his father. I thereupon asked Shaikh Hamad whether such taxes had been levied and he replied somewhat defiantly, that they were much less than those of other countries. I told him that in Bahrain no such taxes were levied on employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and that it was not good policy to in any way hamper the Company in its labour supply especially as the sum involved is a petty one. I said it was also rather unsuitable for'him to take money from such poor oeo'ole.

Sellers J. Skliros :.2 ! *, V Dear Mr. Peel, \ We are advised by our Bahrain Office that the Shaikh of Qatar, on advice given by Kuweiti and Iraqi visitors, has decided to introduce a tax upon our employees at Qatar. We have no definite information as to the form of the taxation proposed, but believe it will require each employee to pay an annual charge for registration and to hand over a percentage (Z% is mentioned as a possible figure) of his pay to the Shaikh. Our Concession contains no provision either authorising the levy of such taxation or granting our employees exemption from any taxation which may be levied upon Qataris generally, but Article 17 does include the following provision; ” and it naturally follows that the wages which n the Company pays to the employees from Qatar people ”shall be reasonable” If the taxation is introduced it will obviously be discriminating against our employees as it cannot be applied to the tribesmen, and we shall undoubtedly be faced later with a demand for increased wages, since it will be argued that wages ”reasenable” today cannot be 'reasonable' after the Shaikh has had his cut. The Shaikh receives a very fair annual payment from the Company and in addition is paid Rs. 13,250 per annum in lieu of free petrol and kerosene, Rs. 1250 p.m. for his representative and a generous lump sum monthly for the guards he provides. We therefore consider that we are justified in resisting any further scheme for extracting more from us. In any case we P.T.O,feel that any taxation introduced sh ° u ^ B^i^IndiLi non-Qataris and particularly to our British, r and American staff and that the Company should dissociate itself from the Shaikh*s scheme particularly if it Invol s, ^ well it may, deduction of the tax by the Company at source from employees* pay. We shall be glad to hear whether you hare any information as to the Shaikh’s intention. ft) R.T.

Referring to your letter PZ.3273/1940 of the 11th June, 1940, we desire to take advantage of a slack period in our operations at Haifa and Tripoli to send Mr. Colhy, our Marine Superintendent at Haifa, to Bahrain and Qatar to conduct preliminary investigations into possible sites for sea loading lines for the shipment of oil from Qatar when that field has been sufficiently developed to permit export. The coastal waters of Qatar do not readily offer deep sea anchorages suitable for tankers and a considerable hydrographical survey may have to be undertaken before a suitable site can be found. Mr. Colby is an American subject and has been employed by Iraq Petroleum Company since 1933. We can vouch for his character and pro-British views.

Permission to employ four American drillers in Qatar was accorded in India Office letter P.Z. 4304/33 dated the 9th July, 1938. Nothing was said in that letter about obtaining the approval of H.M. 0. in each individual case, and I suggest that, to save unnecessary correspondence, it might be sufficient if our Manager at Bahrain keeps the Political Agent, Bahrain informed of any changes in the American personnel of our drilling staff. The American drillers employed at the moment are; and a fourth man, J, Scholder, is now en route to Qatar to replace J.C, Mason. I-ndia Office letter quoted above does not cover the employment of American geologists at Qatar, and I am sorry to say that the necessity of obtaining H.M.G.’s approval was overlooked when Noel Thomas Langham, aged 26, was engaged last year and sent to Qatar in March, 1939. We should be greatly obliged if this omission may be overlooked and approval accorded ex post facto. We would like to keep Langham where he is, as he is doing very well there, as you will see from our Chief Geologist's report on him (copy attached). G. N. Akin H. C. Keck C.H.

Reference India Office Express Fetter Ro.p # z.2483/40 dated the 2nd May 1940, regarding the employment of foreign personnel by Petroleum Concessions limited in Qatar. Express letter under reference mis-states facts considerably, mat has occurred is this. On the 10th of April 1940 I received a request for e h T o Objection Certificate t o be tele graphed to Bombay on behalf of a Portugese subject whom the Company wished to employ in Qatar. I ascertained that this man was to be employed as a clerk and in view of the terms of the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company and in the absence of any special reasons for the employment of a Portugese clerk I declined to issue a Ho Objection Certificate. Mr. Packer came to see me on this i suoject ana appeared to be under the belief that the relevant clause in the Political Agreement was a dead letter. I pointed out to him that on one occasion the Company had asked the permission of His Majesty’s Government to employ a French geologist on the grounds that there were no suitable British geologists available and that similarly the Company had sought permission for American drillers to work in Qatar. 2 . The Company’s letter attached to the India Office2 His Majesty’s Government had agreed in view of the assur ances given by the Company. (I might have added that we had similarly agreed locally to a few Iraqis« who had been trained by the Iraq Petroleum Company* being employed in Qatar to instruct and control local unskilled Isbout). But this case was different. Ho technical knowledge was required and there were literally thousands of British Indian subjects looking for clerical work. I could see no reason therefore for facilitating the employment of a Portugese. 3. It is not true to say that I referred to the 'large numbers of Indian employees who are Portugese Goanese'. It is I believe a fact that half a dozen Goanese are employed as house servants in the Qatar Camp and naturally no object ion has been raised owing to the difficulty of obtaining British Indian servants. 4. I do not think that the Company should be given general authority to employ Portugese Goanese in place of British Indians. Heither for the purpose of the Political Agreement nor for any other purpose can a Portugese be re garded as a British subject as suggested by the Company* but as indicated above if they wish to employ a Portugese house servant in the absence of suitable British Indian applicants it would only be necessary for the Local Manager to explain this to the Political Agent in order to receive the requisite Ho Objection Certificate.

Sellers Dear Mr. Gibson, The Political Agent at Bahrain has drawn the attention of our Bahrain Manager to the fact that a large number of our Indian employees are Portuguese Goanese and that their employment, without the consent of His Majesty's Government, is contrary to the provisions of the Political Agreement between His Majesty's Government and this Company. We may have been lax in this matter but, we have utilized the Anglo-Iranian Company's Agency in Bombay for the recruitment of Indian personnel and have accepted their selections. I shall be glad to know whether you consider we should adhere strictly to the Political Agreement in this connection, or whether Portuguese Goanese for the purposes of the Agreement can be regarded as British subjects. The Political Agent also queries the necessity of the employment of Americans and Frenchmen at Qatar. We have no option other than to employ American drillers as British drillers with sufficient experience are unobtainable. It is only very rarely that a French geologist is employed at or visits Qatar where the senior staff is British and American. If you see no objection to the employment of Americans and the occasional Frenchman at Qatar, I shall be grateful if the Political Resident could be notified accordingly. DIRECTORS : J.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Agreement dated the 5 th February, 1937&gt; made with His Majesty’s Government, whereby this Company undertook to be bound by the Agreement entered into by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with His Majesty’s Government on the 5 th June, 1935. In Article 3 of the latter Agreement it is laid down that the consent of His Majesty’s Government shall be obtained to the employment of persons required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking (i.e. the Qatar Oil Concession), if such persons are not British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar. In accordance therewith I have the honour to request that such consent may be accorded as soon as possible to the recruitment of four American drillers, who are required in connection with the deep-drilling operations 'which it is proposed to initiate in the Qatar Peninsula this autumn. There is at the present time a complete dearth of British drillers in this country, due to the increased activities of such Companies as the ihiglo- I rani an, both in this country and abroad. mven 11 1 * ?

As it is, the Company have agreed that a third party - the owners - shall pay the harbour dues, which is very obliging of the Company but of course in no way binds the said owners* In practice, I imagine that the incidence of the harbour dues, c one way or another, will fall on the Company* ‘•Hired craft* would I suppose technically cover ships, e * g» tankers, I thought it worth while to make the above remarks, but/ 241 JAN 1938 I INDIA OFWQEbut I do not think that any action on our part 1 necessary.

The Ruler was obviously shaken by tha realisation that the Company was aware of his intentions and blustered a good deal bringing in that guards were his responsibility to Government only. He refused to give a figure saying that time was necessary to consider the matter. The matter was followed up with a letter, copy attached. Employment of \atar Aubjaots . This was only controversial in that Mr .Packer insisted that C^atar subjects who were properly qualified only could be absorbed and Mr.Dickson must be the judge on technical matters. The Ruler saw the Company's point of view In principle. In practice there will doubtless be dis agreement in some cases, e*g. the possession of a driving licence does not invariably qualify the owner for employment in the Company as a driver in the desert.

Owing to the restricted nature of the operations the only controversial matter which could not be side tracked was that of the salaries of the two Sheikh 1 s rep resentatives.

Political not informed pending your instructions. The following is the text of our reply of to-day’s date:- ”¥our telegram of November 1st Kuwait is separate Company of entirely different constitution ^ Secondly salaries of appointments under Article o of Kuwait Concession are payable to individuals direct and not to Shaikh Thirdly these representatives are English-speaking and one nominally resident in London. ^ Company emphatically does not admit these as precedent for Qatar L ('ICiLC’dU^C |M AIR MAIL Lt! i cii no, 4 6 r 7 NOV 1956 FROM SECRBTAAV, POLITICAL AND SE0RE1 DEPT, INDIA OFFmErepresentatives now under discussion whose salaries T, shall be reasonable and in keeping with positions and duties”. Report immediately and discuss fully with Political. Work which Shaikh threatens to suspend is work solely in his interests and not ours and you should be prepared to withdraw all personnel from Qatar pending agreement.” The claim of the Shaikh of Qatar to the appointment of two representatives of his own in connection with the Company’s work is based, as you know, upon paragraph 3 of Mr. Mylles* letter to him dated May 17th 193&gt;5« This letter specifies that the appointments are ”on condition that these salaries shall be reasonable and in keeping with their positions and duties”. The Company is anxious to honour this and all other obligations into which it has entered, but it does not feel that this need in the present case involve paying Rs. 3,05Q p.m. into the Shaikh’s pocket. His quotation of the Kuwait Oil Company’s Concession seems entirely irrelevant, as the Company which concluded that Concession is entirely distinct from Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., while the representatives visualised in Articlel6 and 6(c) of the Kuwait Concession evidently differ fundamentally from anything which the Shaikh of Qatar will be able to provide. Moreover, payment of the salaries at Kuwait is to the indiviaual representatives, and not to the Shaikh. If the Shaikh of Qatar indicates his nominees, we are fully prepared to pay them, as from the date upon which tney assume duty, salaries which will be reasonable and m keeping with their positions and duties. Our present suggestion is Rs.100 p.m. each. Our present activities in Qatar are in the direction of honouring the obligation contained in paragraph 1J?:!: Mylles' letter already referred to, that is, of arilii-g “two artesian wells free of charge at Mr Packer's selected by H.E. the Shaikh”. If the Shaikh (as Mr. Pacxe telegram appears to contempiate) prevents us from^^rryi out this obligation, it appears that he, rati be the loser.If a position should arise in which, owing to the Company* s non-acceptance of demands made by the Shaikh, the Company were, in fact, prevented from exercising its rights of exploration, exploitation, etc. under the Concession, the matter would, we imagine, come within the purview of Article 16 of the Concession. V\e feel confident that such a position will not be allowed to arise. Yours sincerely. if M.J. Clauson Esq., India Office, S.W. 1 .India Office. Confidential. Memos.

I na.ve had a letter from Colonel Loch in which he that the last paragraph of my letter of the 18th September (to which you refer in the last paragraph of your letter of the 21st September) somewhat misinterpreted the telegram from him on which it was based. He points out that all he recommended was that he should inform the Sheikh of His Majesty’s Government's approval of the transfer before the Company sent their letter, that is to say that it was more fitting (and expedient) for the Sheikh to learn of His Majesty’s Government’s approval in the first instance from the acting Resident than from the C ompany.

As regards the occasional presence of Ir. N.E. Baker, an American subject, in Qatr, we presume that in the opinion of the Company this is definitely essential for the efficient carrying on of the under taking. If you would be so good as to confirm that this is so, you maytake it that H.M.G. will raise no objection in principle. I am desired to point out m this connection that the presence of employees of the Company who are not British subjects can only be permitted in Qatr (and of course on the Trucial Coast) m very exceptional circumstances, it is hopea that the Company quite appreciate this. As regards the Trucial Coast, the position was made quite clear in Mr. Walton's letter of 12th December, 1935,to Mr. Skliros, and the same considerations apply in respect of Qatr.

In this connection it has been found necessary from time to time to draw the attention of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to the clause about employing British and Bahrain subjects (see, for example, ¥r 0 C3auson*s letter No 0 P.2.5382 dated the 14th August to 38s Mr*Ballantyne) ani it seems probable that Petroleum Concessions Limited will have to be kept up to the mark in the same way* 4.

We will take up with our Legal Advisers the question in what precise form the new Agreement should be drawn up. Your letter of the 2 nd September, P,C,30/83, to the Petroleum Department makes it clear, I think, that the new Company will in due course enter into the necessaiy formal agreement with His Majesty's Government, and the way is therefore now clear for you to instruct Abadan to send off their letter subject to consultation with the Acting Resident as regards its terms and the appropriate moment for delivering it. He may feel it desirable that the ground should be prepared with the Sheikh before the letter is flung at him.

Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. was duly registered on 21st August but so far the Chairman and Board of Directors has not been appointed and there is as yet no information available as to who are the shareholders. According to Longrigg’s letter to Walton of 13th August, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. will be a subsidiary company of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and we have been informed unofficially by the P.C.L, that the Chairman will be Sir John Cadman and that the Board will be identical with the P.C.L. Board. In these circumstances, we think no objection can be raised to the transfer of the Commercial Agreement from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. provided that the latter company agree to enter into an agreement with H.M. Government assuming responsibility for carrying out all the provisions of the Qatar Political Agreement with the amendment suggested in paragraph 3 of Starling’s letter of 30th July, P.D. 21(9). (P.D. (Q. ) Ltd. would of course be substituted for P.C.L. in that amendment.) Although it is the intention that P.C.L. should subscribe to the political agreements in the case of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Bahrein, I think that an exception can be made in the present case, and that we can accept the undertaking from their subsidiary company, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., since the concession is being transferred direct to the latter company, and I g&amp;theredfrom you that it might create M.

The Qatar Agreement included the usual provisions relating, inter alia, to the registration in Great Britain of aw transferee or subsidiary company, but had no similar provisions in respect o 5 the parent company itself, This was not necessary when we were dealing with © company like the Anglo- Per si an, but it would seem desirable to Claus'-m, Sea., India ffice, '.hi .ehsll, S.W. 1.deal with it in the case of Petroleum Concessions Limited, otherwise one of the main objects of the political agreement might be defeated.

II this were done, I think it would be better to reverse the order of paragraphs 1 and 2 , and so refer first of all to the parent company and any subsidiary company, and then deal with any transferee company.

The draft is being sent to Abadan by air mail this week, with instructions that it is not to be despatched to the Shaikh of Qatar until they receive telegraphic instructions from London. Such telegraphic instructions will be sent by us only when we have intimation of the formal approval of His Majesty T s Government to the transfer by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, and the actual conclusion of the formalities involved in the formation of that company. Abadan have further been instructed to send a copy of the draft letter forthwith to the Political Resident and to asertain his views on the action proposed to be taken and as to the wording or otherwise of the letter to the Shaikh. In accordance with Clause I of the Agreement of the 5 th June, 1935? we must, of course, before transferring the Agreement to any othercompany, obtain the prior consent in writing of His Majesty*s Government, and I should be grateful if such consent could be notified to the Company.

Dear Mr. Walton, Article 12 of the Qatar Concession, uuuciiiitjot uju may l/th, 1935&gt; fefe© Anglo-Persian Oil Company, gives that Company the right to transfer its rights to another Company. The phrasing of the Article is somewhat obscure, but it emerges from it that the new Company must be con nected with the Anglo-Persian and must receive the blessing of the Shaikh. We hope that these conditions will be ful filled by Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, the P.C.L. subsidiary which we are at the moment in process of forming for the purpose of accepting the transfer of the Concession and thereafter operating it. In that event, the Agreement of June 5fefe&gt; 193'3&gt; between H.M.Cn and the Anglo-Persian, regarding the Qatar Concession, will in fact devolve upon Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., and we should be very glad to feel that we had your agree ment upon our interpretation of certain points in this. Under Article 1 of the Agreement of June 5fefe&gt; fe * 16 con sent of H.M.G. is necessary to any transfer of the Con cession. May we assume that no objection will be felt to the transfer now contemplated? Under Article 3 fefec consent of H.M.G. is required for the introduction into Qatar of Company 1 s employees who are neither British subjects nor subjects of the Shaikh. ^ May we assume that no objection will be felt to the occasional presence in Qatar of our Chief Geologist,^Mr. N.E. Baker, WO. POL, $EP¥. 14AUG1336 NDiA OFFICE; 3!4‘ 00who is an American'citizen. In the case of other European or American members of the Company*s superior staff, who may be required to visit Qatar in the course of their duties, may we assume that notification of this by our Representative at Bahrain (Mr. E.V. Packer) to the Political Resident will be sufficient? Article 4 provides that the Company 1 s Chief Local Representative in Qatar (being a British subject and having been approved by H.M.G.) shall be ordinarily resident in Qatar. May we assume that no objection will be felt if he is ordinarily resident at Bahrain, but visits Qatar with sufficient frequency to ensure liaison? We should not willingly open a separate office with a British Manager in Qatar until the development of operations there should indicate it. Yours sincerely. J.C.

The Company shall, however, pay the ordinary duty applicable to British merchants in the State of Qatr on all the personal effects, piece-goods, general merchandise and provisions which it imports for the personal use of its employees. And the Company and its operations, incomes, profits and properties shall be exempt and free, during the period of this Agreement, from all the present and future taxes of any kind whatsoever. Article Eleventh. —The Shaikh agrees that he will afford the necessary assistance to carry out this Agreement, and that he will use his authority to protect the Company’s employees and property as far as possible. But the Company shall also, itself, take the necessary steps in this respect, namely, that the Shaikh or his representative will appoint armed guards of his own choice and the Company shall pay the expenses ; and the guards should be sufficient in number and equipment. And neither does the Shaikh guarantee to the Company what may he caused by unforeseen circumstances, nor will he be responsible therefor. For instance, should, God forbid, an attack be made by an enemy or any accident occurs in spite of him, through any aggressor, the Shaikh shall, in case of such aggression, use his endeavour to ward off an aggression of this nature; but he shall not be responsible for any loss or damage thereby caused. Article Twelfth. —The Company has the right to transfer this Agreement to any other commercial Company ; but it shall have not right to transfer it to any Government whatsoever on the conditions that the said Company shall be able to fulfil the obligations of this Agreement and its engagements entirely.

On the termination of this Agreement at the conclusion of the seventy-five years, stipulated for in the Second Article, or the conclusion of any extension or renewal of its period all the Company’s properties existing in the State of Qatr shall be surrendered to the Shaikh free of charge ; and the wells actually producing at that time shall be surrendered in a condition which is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as they used to be at that time. Article Fourteenth .—The Shaikh has the right to cancel this Agreement in the two cases mentioned below 7 : — (A) If the Company fails to pay the sums mentioned in the Fourth Article within six months from the date they fall due. Provided that if any dispute should be made by the Company in regard to any payment thereof, the Shaikh shall not cancel the Agreement until arbitration takes place thereon in accordance with Article Sixteenth and unless the Company fails to comply with the award of the arbitrators within three months from the date of the said award. (B) If the Company is in default according to the provisions for arbitration set forth in the Sixteenth Article. Article Fifteenth.—The Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if default should occur on the part of the Company in carrying out or fulfilling the provisions of the Agreement by the mere occurrence of force majeure delaying operation ; but should anj diffeience occui between Idis hxcellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the existence or non-existence of such force majeure, the same shall be referred to arbitration, as provided for in the Sixteenth Article. And the Shaikh stipulates that the force majeure delaying operation means that which occurs in connection with the Company’s operations in Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into consideration and must not be used b} T the Company as an argument in this respect. And the Company shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage^ of any nature, takes place, and the period of the said delay together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be’ added to the period fixed m accordance with this Agreement. «,g-icc iu i&lt;iie miru aroitrator. it a conditionThe award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal principles familiar to civilised nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final, and the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient time within which the party against whom the award is given, should carry out the said award. And that party shall be considered at fault only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiry of the aforesaid period and not otherwise. Article Seventeenth. —-The labourers employed by the Company must be from amongst the Shaikh’s own subjects or from amongst those approved by the Shaikh, excepting technical employees and. the managers and clerks whom the Company may require and whom it cannot find in the country. As the Shaikh prescribes as a condition the dismissal of any employee whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the employees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth. —The Shaikh and the Company declare that they base action upon this Agreement on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this Agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh’s authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr principality and to respect them in every manner. Article Nineteenth. —Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Shaikh in any manner whatever from granting concessions to other parties for anything excepting the Substances mentioned in the First Article provided that the said concessions do not interfere with the rights of the Company or its operations in accordance with this Agreement. Article Twentieth. —The Company will pay all the sums due to the Shaikh, in accordance with this Agreement, into the Shaikh’s account in the Eastern Bank Limited in Bahrein and the receipt taken from that Bank shall be a full acquittance of the Company’s liability for the sum mentioned in the Bank’s receipt. The Shaikh may, from time to time appoint another Bank or other Banks for the purposes of this Article, and this shall be done in writing. Article Twenty-First. —-This Agreement shall be binding upon both parties and their successors and assigns ; and it has been written in Arabic and English and all due care has been taken to make the two texts identical in meaning. And if any difference should arise as to the meaning or the interpretation of any article, at any time, the Arabic version is to be relied upon. Article Twenty-Second. —The expression year, month and day used in this Agreement shall mean what is consistent with the English Solar Calendar and not any other.

And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Sheikh’s authority and his rights in his capacity as the ruler of the State of Qatar principality and to respect them in every manner. Article 19.

At first he did not much like the suggested redraft of para. 3(b) of the letter to be addressed to the Sheikh, and m this connection now raised an objection to Clause 11 of the Govt. Agreement - v 12 . , that it does not make it clear that if the Sheikh gives notice of termination, the Coy, will nevertheless remain in possession pending arbitration. This is provided for in Clause 14 of the concession Agreement. After discussion it was agreed that (subject to reference to Mr. Fraser and Mr. Agnew on his side, and to the authorities concerned on ours) this point could be met by an addition to Clause 11 in the sense of the words underlined m the attached redraft. With this addition to Clause 11 Mr. Lefroy thought that the new draft of para. 3(b) of the letter would be unobjectionable from his point of view.INDIA OFFICE, .iHITEHALL, 3.W, 1.

S. s. , At tiie end of last no nth. after lengthy negotiations with the sheiich of Q,atr, Mr. Mylles, the representative of the A.P.O.C., who has been negotiating j.or an oil concession in Q.atr on behalf of the Company, reported that agreement had been reached with the Sheikh cut that the latter wished to delay the actual signature of the concession until agreement had been reached between himself and H.M.G. (P.Z.3051/35 ). The Political Resident thereupon proceeded to Qatr at the beginning of this month with a view to reaching a final settlement of the points still outstanding between H.M.G. and the Sheikh after Colonel Fowle’s previous discussions with the Sheikh in April, the results of which were reported in his telegram No. 372 of 22nd April at P.Z.2354/3&amp; The main questions to be settled with the Sheikh (other than the Sheikh* s acceptance of the terms of the Government Agreement as overriding^ in ca.ses of inconsistency,the terms of the Commercial Agreement - see below) were the protection to be afforded by H.M.G. to the Sheikh in the event of his granting a concession to the A.P.O.C. and the .jurisdiction to be surrendered to H.M.G. by the Sheikh over British subjects and protected persons and non-Muslim foreigners in the same event. Colonel Fowle now reports in his telegram No.T.136 of 11th May (p.Z.3281/35) that he has reached agreement with the Sheikh on the following lines;- ( a ) Protection . The Sheikh accepts H.M.G. f s guarantee of external protection against serious and unprovoked attacks^and agrees to grant the necessary facilities to the R.A.F. to enable H.M.G. to implement this guarantee. The Sheikh also accepts H.M.G.*s limited assurance of external support in any difficultier i'Vs. an sing /Minute Paper Department. it ‘K* v&gt; 2956 6000 7 34 arising from the presence of the Oil Company. (The Sheikh* s request that H.M. G. should accord himself and his son, Hamad, when the latter succeeded him, full support in internal matters has, of course, been rejected.) CM J urisdiction . The arrangements agreed with the Sheikh will be similar to those at present existing in Koweit, viz. the sheikh surrender? to H.M.G. jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons and non-Muslim foreigners except that British protected persons who are subjects of Bahrein, Koweit, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms will remain as in Koweit under his own jurisdiction, subject to the usual arrangements for joint jurisdiction in mixed cases. (c) The Sheikh’s son, Hamad, is recognised by H.M.G. as his successor and promises to accept the terms of the 1916 Treaty with H.M.G. on his accession. The recognition of Hamad as successor does not commit H.M.G. to more than moral support in the event of a disputed succession ( vide (a) above). (d) The Sheikh agrees to convert the 1916 Treaty into an ’’heirs and successors” one. The arrangements mentioned above may be regarded as on the whole satisfactory and Colonel Bowie is to be congratulated on having succeeded in overcoming the Sheikh*s suspicions and reaching such a successful result. The conversion of the 1916 Treaty into an ’’heirs and successors” treaty by agreement witn the Sheixh is particularly satisfactory from our point of view. It is understood that the Concession Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is now on the point of signature. It is in accordance with the sheikh’s draft (flagged *B f on the file) with the important omission of the last, sentence (in pencil) of Article 18, which would have provided for the settlement of disputes between foreign employees of the Company and any of the Sheikh’s subjects by the Shara (religious) courts (this question is, of course, covered by the agreement reached regarding jurisdiction at (b) above). The Concession (Commercial) Agreement will be signed^ the Company together with a letter to the Sheikh stating that it is signed subject to/I Minute Paper. 2956 6000 7 34 Department. to the approval of in accordance with tne Sheikh*g treaty obligations. ne--v.L step is one signature of the Government Agreement between the Company and H.M.G. regarding the conditions to be observed by the Company in the event oi tmeir obtaining an oil concession from the Sheikh of kCmr. The draft of this Agreement will be found ^/f immediately below. It is similar mutatls mutandis to the Koweit Government Agreement and contains the usual ’•Biiuish H safeguards. The Company and the other Departments concerned (the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department) concur in the terms of the draft Government Agreement and it is desirable that it should be signed as soon as possible. When both Agreements are signed they will be linked by means of an exchange of letters between the Political Resident and the Sheikh in the terms of the drafts flagged *C’ and *D* on the file (with possibly certain minor modifications of wording). This procedure is in accordance with the Koweit precedent. This exchange of letters, the terms of which will also be accepted by the Company, will ensure that the terms of the Commercial Agreement are subordinate^in any case of inconsistency / to the terms of the Government Agreement and will provide for the termination of the concession by the Sheikh (subject to a reference to arbitration) if the Company fail to observe any of the terms of the Government Agreement. It is submitted that approval may be given to the signature of the Government Agreement on behalf of H.M.G. by a member of this Office. The three other Government Departments concerned have already agreed to this procedure.A V Minute Paper. Department. (f6s) ihe success of Col. Fowle and also of ! r. - j x-lcf. , the A.P.0.0. representative, in their respective spheres in these complicated negotiations is very gratifying. ihe A.P.O.C. , as a result of their standing agreement with the other partners in the I.P.C. (i.e., pi incipally the Royal Dutch Shell and the American and Drench groups), will, we understand, have to give these partners the option of coming m with them as joint holders of the concession. But it is always possible that some of the other partners may not wish to do so, anci there is therefore some prospect of the eventual concessionaire company being predominantly British. In any case, there was no possibility of securing a better chance of a majority British holding, because Qatar falls within the sphere within which the partner groups c in the I.P.C. have agreed that none of them will seek a concession independently of the other groups; and no other substantial British oil company was, so far as we know, prepared to interest itself in Qatar; on the other hand, the Standard Oil Coy. of California, which has obtained from Ibn Saud a concession on the neighbouring Hasa coast, was known to be deeply anxious to obtain the Qatar concession and the Sheikh was aware of this and was already,in touch with them. Unless, therefore, the Anglo- Persian had succeeded in obtaining the concession, we should have had^the onus of vetoing the almost certain desire of the purely American Coy. and the Sheikh to come / lA * /'.'X / to terms with one another^ suad the concession would have been sterilised) n &lt;) ^ 2956 6000 7/34 The/— T II W III„ The outcome of Col. Fowled negotiations on the purely political questions of protection, jurisdiction, succession and the Treaty of 1916 is very satisfactory, in view esoecially of the somewhat unyielding aotituoe which the Sheikh was at first inclined to adopt on of these points. The undertakings given to and by the Sheikh and his son Hamad are more fully described m the letters of which we have received copies by air mail (P.Z. /35). One other question covered by Col. Fowle's negotiations was Nthe Sheikh's enquiry whether in the case of an emergency he would be permitted to import rifles m excess ©f the annual quota of 500 allowed to him by the 1916 treaty, and whether he could be permitted to purchase machineguns and armoured cars. Col. Fowle was authorised to rake replies to these enquiries on the lines of the S. of S.’s telegram of 9th May at P.Z. 3184/35. The Sheikh has not in the past j availed himself of his right to 500 rifles a year, and it was therefore felt that we could reasonably agree not to ti6: him down to this quota, and that we could promise to deal sympathetically with any request for rifles made in case oi an emergency. On the other hand, we declined to commit ourselves on the question of machineguns and armoured cars, as i-here is no reason to anticipate a situation m which the Sheikh would require such weapons, though, if such a situation arose, we would be prepared to consider representations. The Govt. Agreement providing for political safeguards in connection with the oil concession has now to be signed, and when this has been done Col. Fowle has to explain to the Sheikh the letters proposed to be exchanged with him in order to link the Govt. Agreement with/ &amp;Jr tL bp lA (lin ich iese id )f j 3 ). ^ 5 was with tliG conce sb ion Agreement • Go 1 • Fowle proposes to return to Qatar for this purpose very shortly (he leaves Baghdad for Bahrain on 24th 1 ay, according to his present prograrame), and it is therefore a matter of / * urgency to get the Govt. Agreement signed. Its terms have of course been agreed on by the Coy. and the other Govt. Depts. concerned, except that there is a small point which e ins redies * grass past it to tu ,eai ise &gt;!®it cars, LCt V:i : rt has been raised by the Coy. at the last moment in regard to Clause 11.

Letter^dated the 11th May 1935 from the Shaikh of 6 . Letter dated the 11th May 1935 from Mr.C.Mylles, AiVjl o-Persian Oil Company. Letter No .6 is from Mr.Mylles. Mr.Mylles informed me that the Shaikh insisted on this alteration at the last moment, and has doubtless reported fully to his Company. The effect of this alteration may be to exclude interests other than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company e.g. the Iraq Petroleum Company. However that is a matter for the Company to settle. The delay of 2 or 3 days in signing the Commercial Agreement, referred to in paragraph 3 of my telegram quoted above, was due to the following attitude taken by the Shaikh, which illustrates the almost childish suspicious nature of himself and his son Hamad. At my final interview with him, when I settled our political points, I suggested that the Commercial Agreement should now be signed with Mr.Mylles. The Shaikh said: ’Ho. He wanted his payment-on-signature before he actually signed’. I suggested that Mr.Mylles could telegraph to the bank in Bahrain, and the latter could then wire the Shaikh that the/the money had been put to his credit. The Shaikh replied 'that this would never do. How could he know if the telegram from Bahrain really came from the Bank ? The Company might send the telegram themselves in the name of the bank and not deposit the money at all - He the Shaikh - would have to send a man of his own to ascertain that the money was really in the bank'. Finally it was agreed that Mr.Mylles would telegraph to the bank and the Shaikh's man would be sent to Bahrain to bring back the credit note and show it to the Shaikh. 3. Some of Mr.Mylles' difficulties in dealing with such an individual may be imagined and as I have already said in paragraph 11 of my telegram No.372 of 23nd April 1935 he has conducted his negotiations with mach patience, tact and skill. Moreover I received useful assistance from him during my two visits to Qatar. Enclosure No. 6. To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Doha. Sir, I beg to advise you that as a result of further negotiation with the Shaikh of Q,atar this morning I have agreed to an alteration in Article 12 and the last sentence thereof viz. after the word Agreement the insertion of the Clause '•and that Company so formed shall be identical with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited'. This in effect restricts the Company’s right to form one subsidiary only. -DOHA , Qatar. 11th May 1935. I have, etc., (Sd.) Chas. marnmmmmmmmm Mylles.OEEIGrU OEEICE, ^.W.l 16th May, 1935.

In confirmation of our telephone conversation this afternoon, we have just received from Mylles a telegram sent off to-day, stating that he has received a vaguely worded letter of acceptance of the concession terms with a definite refusal on the Shaikh’s part to sign pending complete agreement between the Shaikh and H.M.G.

Last night Abadsn telegraphed that they had forwarded to Mylles advice received from the Resident, that Mylles should confirm in writing to the Shaikh that agreement had been reached with the Company, but that the Shaikh wished to delay signature until agreement had been reached between himself and H.M.G.

J. G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E., India Office, S.W.l. Dear Laithv/aite, Qatr In confirmation of our telephone conversation this afternoon, a telegram came in last night from Mylles stating that agreement had been reached within the limits of his financial discretions, but that the Shaikh of Qatr wished to delay signature until agreement had been reached between himself and H.M.G. For the present the Shaikh was not fit for further discussion, but a doctor was expected to-day. In addition to the straightforward financial provisions we have accepted a liability to bear the expenses of two representatives of the Shaikh in Qatr if necessary, with salaries which are to be reasonable and suitable to their position and duties. We have furthermore sanctioned grants of considerable quantities of free petrol and kerosene to the Shaikh during the currency of the Agreement. We telegraphed to-day to Mylles reminding him of the arrangements made with you, under which when he signs it must be subject to the approval of H.M.G. Furthermore, after signature copies of the Concession and letter of reservation are to be sent to the Resident._ - 2 m Mylles has informed us of the salutary- effects of the Resident’s recent visit to Qatr &gt; but did not mention the Government/Company Agreement, so I expect that the Resident thought that with jurisdiction and other difficult questions there was enough debatable matter for the moment with the Shaikh, and as we originally arranged will show the Shaikh the Government/Company Agreement after some concession has been signed.— iMiiiyiiiiui iiiMa^ \ SECRET 55?) m/m (COPIES CIRCULATED) ( 41 groups 0 ) E3?3, jL .1 C Y P HE R OF TELEGRAM^ Prom Political Resident in the Persian (JuH to Secretary of state for Xndiao Dated Risher* 30th Aprils 1935 0 ReceiTed 5o3 i » p 0 nio # 30th Aprils 1935 ° XXX 413^ Addressed to Secretary of State for li)dia ? repeated to Government of India,, Tour telegram of the 36th instant* 1304 o I presume that Government of India are replying to your paragraph 3 C I propose leaving here for JCatr on May 4th c In this connection jlease see paragraph Fo 0 3 of my Express letter 332-S* April 25th, sent by air mail which should reach you on May 5th cp SECRET Cypher telegram from Secretary of state addressed °o political Resident ?

His Majesty’s Government approve proposals in paragraph 4 of your telegram with modification that for ’teerious incursions” they would substitute ’’serious and unprovoked attack”. They assume, however, that sheikh fully realises (c.f. my telegram of 2nd March, 1934, 582) that they will expect him to take all reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own borders, a point to whic h t he y at t ach much impor t anc e . 3. It is the case that our normal practice is not to grant recognition, and His Majesty’s Government would prefer to maintain this policy. On the other hand there have been exceptions, (e.g. the present sheikh of Bahrein was recognised as Heir Apparent in 1901). Ii, however, recognition of Hamad as Heir Apparent is essential to clinch matters, His Majesty’s Government, subject to anyfurther views ox Government of India, “would be prepared to consider anting recognition as special case. (Sine qua non of mmir recognition of any new Sheikh would of course be furl acceptanoe by him of obligations of Qatar Treaty or 1916, which there would be advantage, if possible, in convoibins into an 'heirs and successors” treaty). Unusual nature or concession vdiich this would represent, pnibicuiaily in view2 . oi Hamad's unpopularity, might he employed not only to clinch oil uueobion, sue to remove difficulties over jui isaleuion, intelligence officers, etc. Jmisometion. His Majesty’s Government agree that you should take line proposed in paragraph 8 (a) of your telegram. You might also make play with objections taken bj‘ Q,utar in 19 80 to his own subjects falling under Bahreini jurisdiction (see P.G. 13, page 63, paragraph 10}. They axe advised, nowever, that there is no strict construction °i 'Bj. i tish pi otected peimons” and to that extent our hands are free. Nor is there, even at present time, uniformity oi practice in dealing with these matters in the Gulf. Jui isdic oion exercised in Bahrein b 3 r His Majesty's Government extends to subjects of Moslem foreign States, including Gulf States, as •.well as to other foreigners. In Koweit, on the other hand, jurisdiction over subjects of Moslem foreign States, including Gulf States, vests in Sheikh. If, for any reason, it was thought desirable to concede this point in Qatar there are thus good precedents. 5 . Subject to remarks in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, His Majesty's Government approve action proposed in paragraph 8 of your telegram under reply and agree that you should present 1etter personally. 6 . They are prepared to leave time-table to you, but think it important to secure necessary assurance from Sheikh if possible before signature of Oil Agreement and in any event with minimum of delay thereafter. They feel strongly that our position would be much weaker in dealing with advances from other parties once Company’s option has expired.4 l! k;»/aw. \ ^ a O ' JU w ^ J/ B E C Y P H E H OF T EL S G B A M c yrom (COPIES CIBCULATSD) Bat Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India* Bated Riaher,, 23rd April, 1935* Received 23rd April, 1935, 5 p 0 m. o 283® Addressed to Secretary of State for India and repeated to Koweit and Bahrein® IJIy telegram of the 23rd instant, 372, paragraph Uo«lX, and paragraph Ho 0 3p my express letter 25, March Sth,, Dickson writes that Holmes,, in course of conversation-, mentioned that he had it on good authority that Miller of Standard Oil Company of California, Hasa, was making all preparations to approach Sheikh of Katr as soon as Anglo^Peraian Oil Company's option expired*I naanmnaaRa! / f UC/DIAc ( E^o groupe) SECRET S63) 9o 'r.2822, ILSJJJLOJK-B^eJ! lJLL.JiJL.jR A Prom (COP.IKS CIRCULATED) Political Resident in the Persian Cult . to Secretary of state for India, Deted Risher, 22nd April, 19S5, Received 22nd April, 1935, 7 XXX 3 . 72 g Pirgt of Th ree Part s.

And the Company shall have the liberty to form a single Company, if it finds it necessary, to carry out this Agreement, and the aforesaid Company shall enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to the Company in virtue of this Agreement, and it must bear all the engagements and responsibilities set forth therein. Article Thirteenth. The Company may terminate this Agreement if it finds it disagreeable for it to act upon the same; but it shall have j UA.Ixfv'C.dt _ no right to cancel it or to abandon it and to discontinue operating it except after three years with effect from the beginning of operation, by giving six months’ previous notice, in writing, to the Shaikh of its intention to do so. And if the said cancellation should take place within thirty five years from the date of signature of this Agreement, all the lands granted by the Shaikh and any lands or buildings purchased by the Company and any houses or buildings constructed by, and any immovable properties belonging to, the Companywithin the State of Qatr shall be surrendered to the Shaikh free of charge. And the wells actually producing at the time of the said cancellation shall be surrendered in a condition considered to be np'od and satisfactory, as they were at that time. And if the said cancellation should take place after thirty five years from the date of signature of this Agreement, all the Company 1 s properties within the'state of Qatr shall be surrendered, m that case, to the Shaikh, free of charge] and the wells actually producing at the time of the said cancellation shall be surrendered m a condition which is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as they were at that time. On the termination of this Agreement at the conclusion of the seventy five years, stipulated for in the second article, or the conclusion of any extension or renewal of its period all the Company’s , . . . r 'I proper les existing in the State of Qatr shall be surrendered to the Shaikh free of charge; and the wells actually producing at that time shall be surrendered in a condition which is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as they used to be at that time. Afj— Fourteenth. The Shaikh has the right to cancel this Agreement in the two cases mentioned below?- (A) If the Company fails to pay the sums mentioned in the fourth article within six months from the date they fall due. Provided that if any dispute should be made by the Company in regard to any payment thereof, the Shaikh shall not cancel the Agreement until arbitration takes place thereon in accordance with article sixteenth and unless the Company fails to comply with the award of the arbitrators within three months from the date of the said award. (B) If .the Company is in default according to the provisions for arbitration set forth in the sixteenth article. Article Fifteenth. The Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if default should occur on the part of the Company in carrying out or fulfilling the provisions of the Agreement by the mere occurence of fvs&amp;u force majeure delaying operation; but should any difference occur between His Excellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the existence or non-existence of such force majeure, the same shall bereferred to arbitration, as provided for in the sixteenth article. And the Shaikh stipulates that the force majeure delaying operation means that which occurs in connection with the Company’s operations Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into consideration and must not be used by the Company as an argument in this respect. And the Company shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage, of any nature, takes place;, and the period of the said delay, together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be added to the period fixed in accordance with this Agreement. Sixteenth. Should any dispute occur between the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the interpretation of this Agreement or of any matter arising therefrom or in regard to the engagements obligatory on either of the parties in accordance therewith, such dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators if no Agreement can be arrived at for settling it by any other method, and the Shaikh will appoint one of them and the other will be appointed by the Company. Each of the two parties shall appoint his arbitrator within thirty days after receiving the demand therefor from the other party. The two arbitrators shall thereupon appoint a third arbitrator; but if the two arbitrators or any two arbitrators appointed instead of them are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days from the demand for arbitration, the two parties agree that, in that case, the third arbitrator should be appointed by the Political Resident; and the Shaikh makes it a condition that he should agree to the third arbitrator. '-V The award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal principles familiar to civilized nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final; and the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient time within which the party against whom the award is given, should carry out the said award. And that party she.ll be considered at fault only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiryof the aforesaid period and not otherwise. Article Seventeenth. The labourers employed by the Company must be from amongst the Shaikh's own subjects or from amongst those approved the Shaikh } excepting technical employees and the managers and clerks whom the Company may require and whom it cannot find in the rr&gt;aAz..s&amp; xV - ^ $LauoJl £W&gt;a!ld country. And the Shaikh prescribes as a condition the dismissal of irv any employed whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the /VO ttcas ..W Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the employees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth. The Shaikh and the Company declare that they base action upon this Agreement on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this Agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh’s authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr oipa 1-i-t-y and to respect them in every cUSjpuJLt' sc» cf uctHHC?. bftuHSLM, IS) ..J'tnfuqi : 4 n fei Air sui-fc^-c. ^ r. ^|' vovm cUSouAZ' zn q a manner.

Article Twentieth. The Company will pay all the sums due to the Shaikh, in accordance with this Agreement, into the Shaikh’s account in the Bank in and the receipt taken from that Bank shall be a full acquittance of the Company’s liability for the sum mentioned in the Bank’s receipt. The Shaikh may, from time to time, appoint another Bank or other Banks for the purposes of this Article, and this shall be done in writing. Article Twenty-First.

A My dear Walton, I have been looking through the recent correspondence regarding the Qatar Oil negotiations, and there are one or two points which I should like to mention. I am afraid I do not agree with the suggestion contained in paragraph 7(b) of Fowle T s letter of March 8 th that the interests represented by Holmes merely because they might be 100 per cent. British would suit us better than the Iraq Petroleum Company. If a concession were obtained, either by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Arabian Development Syndicate, or by Traders Limited, there would be no guarantee that they would work the concession themselves. These companie , \ ' Nj |1 have not the experience or organisation to work an oil concession. They are concession'hunters, and would, we believe, seek to dispose of it as soon as possible, as the J. C. Walton, Esq., O.B., M.C., India Office, King Charles Street, S.W.l.v - t * ‘ k 1 i i ! • 2 - Bastern and Gan©ral. Syndicats did in t;b .6 oasa of ths ]3alrii8in conoession. They might very well offer it first of all to British companies, as was done in the case of Bahrein, hut we ; know t the difficulty of finding a substantial^British operating company which is able to talcs up a concession in this area. Having done through what so far as we can see can he little mere than a formality, we should then he faced with a request to agree to the assignment of the concession to a foreign oil company. In theory H.Ivl. Government would have the right to refuse hut I feel that in practice we r should find great difficulty in maintaining our refusal. 3 In paragraph 4 of the note of the meeting held at the India Office on the 28th March it is assumed that an American ♦ Company would he unlikely to accept our safeguards. I do not think we can hank on this, and as I have more than once &lt; pointed out there are several quite substantial American Companies outside the Iraq Petroleum Company, and if they were keen they could, I reel sure, meet us. Let me quote as an example the Anglo-American Oil Company, which is the subsidiary r j.n this country of the Standard Oil Company of New Jereiay# Phis-3- (594) Company has an entirely British Board of Directors, the Chairman Being a Canadian, and without going this length an American controlled Company would have no difficulty in complying with the clauses of the draft Government Agreement for Qatar. I am sorry to have to stress this point hut I do feel that it may be very dangerous to work on the assumption that we are safe against American Companies because of our safeguards, even though these are rather more stringent than those in the case of Bahrein. .bowle then goes on to say that the Iraq Petroleum Company is only about one-quarter British. This is not the case, for, in addition to the Anglo-Persian shareholding, the Royal Dutch-Shell holding must be taken into account. In the memorandum which I sent to Colonel Fowle in May 1933 on the position in Arabia and the Persian Gulf, I pointed out that the British shareholding in the Iraq Petroleum Company actually represents about 33f per cent. The Royal Dutch- Shell group hold 23^ per cent, of the capital in addition to the Anglo-Persian holding. This group works very closely with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and their outlook and policy are so much British that for practical purposes we can almost regard the whole of their share of the capital as British. Further, while-4- + T fl£rT&gt;ee there does not seem any prospect of the at present I agree rr tnp Anclo-Persian and Shell Iraq Petroleum Company allowing tne A., thi= area. I do not thirfewe should to hold concessions in this area, 0 f this difficulty being removed rule out the possibility 01 L ^ + nr* of* some adjustment of the red line being in the future, or oi some made, which would have the same result. j would suggest that these considerations should be brought to Fowle's notice as, while it may be difficult Company continue their bargaining on the financial terms, we ought to be clear in our minds where we shall stand if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company drop out. And there is always the possibility of the Shetth carrying on these negotiations to a certain point, during which he will have had the benefit of securing the views of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and then calling them off, so that he may start up discussions with someone else, who although British may be ol litule use to us or the Sheikh. What I weald like to suggest is that Fowle should take an opportunity before the 4th May of indicating to the Sheikh that his interests will best be served by granting the concession to a concern which is qualified to work it and that he should re-iterate what he-5- (5&lt;\s) 'Uh^ told the Sheikh, on a former occasion thQt H # M # Government will not he prepared to agree to approve the grant ol a concession except to a concern which was at least partly British.

It has already been agreed (Mr. Lefroy*s letter of 10th October 1934, on P.Z.6327/34) that signature must be ad referendum and subject to the approval of H.M.G. The point was made that in these circumstances it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Gompany to make the first payment under the agreement immediately on signature.

Article 11 . The Company were Av- ^ apprehensive thaf the Sheikh might endeavour to secure armaments on an unjustifiable scale from them with a view to epuipping his forces with machine guns, armoured cars, etc. for the purpose of repelling krvx^AA) ' rW’- ^ v'-v raids. They w^r-e most reluctant to involve themselves in any such commitment, not least because any provision of arms by the Company might expose the mi to international criticism. It was agreed after discussion that having regard to the provisions of Article 3 oi the Qatar Treaty of 1916 and the fact that the question of what provision of arms, etc. was *sufficient* was open to reference to arbitration, the Comipany could probably take,the risk involved in accepting the sheikh*s redraft as it stood. Article 16 . Provision that the Sheikh*s consent should be necessary to the third arbitrator. It was agreed to mention/3. mention this point to the Political Resident, Mr. Wylies felt confident that the sheikh (or his son) woula in practice agree to whatever name tne Resident suggestea. The ehject of this clause was largely that the Sheikh thought that its insertion would make it less likely that the Resident would nominate someone who would he entirely unacceptable to the sheikh and under the influence of the Company. -The India^Office representatives indicated that they proposed to ascertain colonel Fowle r s views on this point. Article 17 . The question was raised of what action H.M.G. would take if the Sheikh, for some frivolous reason, were to require the removal of the Chief Local Representative. It was thought that this risk was one which could probably be faced. In practice it might prove necessary in such an ©vent to bring political pressure to bear upon him. Article 18 . Sub-paragraph £. This was discussed in detail. Mr. Mylies stated that he had informed the sheikh that the matter was one for H.M.G.,, into which the Company could not enter; that the sheikh had taken the line that it had better go in the agreement and that if H.M.G. objected they could then take it up with him (the sheikh). The Company were strongly opposed to ti.e acceptance of any such provision and were given to understand that it was objectionable4. f ,4&gt; J&lt;;^\ ^ ^ -:L ' f -/wA^ S 0 ^ c 5 t^ A h ^ { - ( y^’ t' ■' '■'“ '^ #Vv tf^. ^ ^ rat •- f^XA^l &lt; *~ i ^ ^ oojtvUa.^ ^ tw' f^o^duunX (‘*&gt;tJr ) ov^jc . /VO; ^U.

The Company's representatives enquired what the attitude of H.M.G. would de if negotiations now broke down and if the Cheikh subsequently intimated his aesire to grant the concession to another company on less favourable terms than had been offered by .the A.P.O.C*. It was pointed out to them that there were great 'tAk/i ao fiv&lt; ib. Ape &lt; difficulties in giving thoai what would in effect be a continuing option on the concession on whatever terms they were at this stage prepared to offer; but that in the first place, so far as the Standard of California were concerned, it seemed most an unlikely that the American Company would be prepares to accept the British safe guards which the sheikh was aware were a sine qua non of H.M.G.'s approval to the grant of any concession, while so far as other companies who might comply with these conditions were concerned there seemed no reason why the sheikh, if his negotiations with the A•P*G*C* broke down on the question of finance, should be prepared to accept less favourable terms from another company. The 'British safeguards' would of course be of universal application. ■2 $ ys ——fl' L. lUZ l+s *+*£+ 4/ ■“&gt;5 / J *7- Mr. Waltpn, Please see Mr. LeXroy’s letter of 26th torch 'below and the alternative draft produced by the sheikh of Qatar. £• The draft leaves the financial provisions blank. These are to be a matter for further discussion. I have noted in the margin the more important differences of substance (the wording is, of course, substantially different throughout) between the revise and the Company’s . i-R* kAajOL? / ,/ draft. But broadly speaking I ao not think thatfanything very vital is involved with the exception of the provision in Article 12 that not more than one subsidiary or transferee company shall be formed; the elaboration of the provisions regarding force maieure in Article 15; the Sheikh’s proviso that he shall agree to the third arbitrator in Article 16; and the modifications of Article 17. There is also a modification of some little importance in Article 21. 3. The really important modification - the suggestion that disputes between subjects of the Sheikh and foreign employees of the Company should be dealt with by the Shara Courts - is in Article 18. The company not unnaturally object to this and we should, I think, support them on it. Our difficulty, of course, is that there is no Order-in-Council, so that any arrangement in regard to jurisdiction will be a matter for discussion with the Sheikh, on this we may have to consult the Resident. But whoever obtained the Qatar concession we should have to make a similar provision and if necessary this could be made clear to the sheikh.4. The sooner Mr. lilies returns and continues with the negotiations the better. Colonel Powle, from his express letter of 8th Mirch on P.2.1928/35, appears willing to view with some equanimity negotiations between a company backed by Holmes and ‘♦purely British* and the Sheikh. Unsatisfactory as the relatively small percentage of British control in the I.p.C. may be, we should, 1 think, do much better to concentrate on obtaining the concession for them, our investigations in connection with Traders did not go to suggest that, even if they were financially sound, they (and this applies still more to bodies such as the Arabian Development Syndicate) were likely to be as satisfactory exploiters of a concession as the I.P.C. On the other hand, we clearly must endeavour so to play our cards as to avoid any justification for a suggestion that we are discriminating against a purely British in favour of an only partially British company.■££a.ffr Art^e 4,, In consideration of the rights granted by the Shaikh to the Company In accordance with this Agreement the Company shall make the following payments to the Shaikh during the currency of the Agreement:- (a) On the date of signature (b) On each of the first four anniversaries of the date of signature (c) On the fifth and each subsequent anniversary of the date of signature until the Company declares it has found oil in commercial quantity (d) Thereafter the Company shall pay royalty on the Substances as follows: (D On all substances won and saved other than asphalt, ozokerite and natural gases per ton (2240 English pounds) at the rate of (2) On asphalt and ozokerite won and saved per ton (2240 English pounds) at the rate of Rs.

Copy by Air to Government of India, New Delhi tt ' u M Political Agent, Bahrain. Copy given to Political Agent, Kuwait. Subject ; Qatar Oil My telegram Mq»T» 16 of 6 th March. General position is that Shaikh before taking up financial terms of Commercial Agreement has raised various objections over other clauses some of which Mylles has succeeded in persuading him to drop while others still remain for discussion. 2. Details of the position are given in attached Summary provided by Mr. Clegg of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Shaikh’s demands in regard to Articles 12 and 16 would appear to affect His Majesty’s Government either directly or indirectly. Article 12. This would give the Shaikh a veto on a transfer, suggested by the Iraq Petroleum Company, and approved of by His Majesty*s Government. Article 16. Unless both the Shaikh and the Political Resident agreed on the choice of an Umpire a deadlock wixl result. 3 0 Anglo -Persian Oil Company informed me that from information received they believed Holmes had immediate designs of visiting Qatar to intrigue with Shaikh and asked me to prevent him doing so ix possible. Holmes arrived yesterday and in the course of conversation (at. which Dickson was /was present) I informed him frankly that I had heard f rumours‘ to the above effect* Holmes (whom I like personally whatever I may think of him officially) said that he appreciated my frankness and that he had no intention of visiting Qatar or of negotiating for oil there until at all events the Anglo- Persian Oil Company concession had expired* In the meantime he would be busy here with Kuwait Oil Company geologists* I am informing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Abadan of this. 4. Pursuing a policy of frankness I sasked Holmes who he would act for when and if he negotiated at Qatar* He made the following interesting statement. That he had in the last few months been approached by two 'one hundred per cent' British groups (who had since amalgamated into one group) to negotiate on their behalf in Qatar, but had told them there was ‘nothing doing* until the Anglo-Tersian Oil Company option had expired without their being successful in obtaining the concession. That if this occurred, more especially if the Americans were after the concession, he would certainly enter the field. 5* Holmes did not give me this information in confidence but I see no necessity for it to be passed to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company a 6 » I did not ask him the names of his hundred per cent British backers but it is quite possible that they may be Traders under another name - with Eastern and General and Arabian Development Syndicate elements added* 7. The situation is therefore as follows: (a) If My lies concludes the Commercial Agreement then the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Company will have to be presented tothe Shaiklx for concurrence. (b) If the Shaikh refuses the concession to the Anglo- Persian Cil Company then Holmes will enter the field and since his Company will be purely British (if on examination of their credentials this is found to be so) His Majesty^ Government can give them their blessing. In fact such a Company would suit us better than the Iraq Petroleum Company for whom the Anglo-Persian Cil Company are acting since the Iraq Petroleum Company are only about one quarter British. sd.

We have received further reports from Mylies indicating the difficulty of the negotiations- hut not as yet any actual redrafts proposed by the Shaikh. The Shaikh has told Mylles that Holmes had written suggesting that he should come to Qatr secretly and make him an offer. The Shaikh said that he had not replied as he was not like Ahmed of Kuwait but liked to do things openly. A reply was sent through Nasir al Mana f to the' effect that the Shaikh did not approve his coming to Qatr in disguise, and did not agree that if he came to terms with us he was to withhold his signature for two months to enable Holmes to make an offer, but he did agree to Holmes coming to Qatr immediately our option expired (i.e. now after May 4th) if he had not already come to terms with us, and that he would give Holmes preference over us in any subsequent negotiations Nasir al Mana T asked Holmes to send his proposals in writing at once, as he and his cousin Saleh could guarantee to get the Shaikh to consider them and delay coming to terms with us until the option expired. 1 . 0 -‘-.f/- a- S'ECRE •RE i £The Shaikh T s initial comments on our draft were largely not in the local Arabic but in modern and up-to-date Egyptian Arabic, and contain words and phrases unknown in Qatr.

If there happen to be force majeure and if the Company is rendered unable or held back from fulfilling any of the conditions of this Agreement, it will not be permissible for me to deem this accident as an argument against the Company or to interpret it as a breach of this Agreement. It is obligatory upon me, in that case, to add the period of the delay together with any period which may be necessary for the rectification of the delay according to reason and truth to the period fixed in this deed, and the Company shall proceed to make the necessary restoration of such damage as expeditiously as possible. Condition Sixteenth . If, God forbid, any dispute should arise between me and the Company as to the interpretation of any condition of this Agreement, or as to any matter arising out of it or with reference to the obligations of either party under it, and if no agreement be arrived at by any other way, it is imperative, in that case, to refer the said dispute to two arbitrators, and t myself shall appoint one of them; and the Company shall appoint the other each of us appointing his arbitrator within thirty days of receiving a request from the other party to do so. The two arbitrators shall then appoint a third arbitrator; but should the two arbitrators, or any other two arbitrators appointed instead of them, be unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days of the request to arbitrate, we agree that the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The i award of arbitration must be made in accordance with the general principles of law recognised by civilized nations. And the Jdecision 01 the majority of the arbitrators shall be final. The place of arbitration shall be Qatr; but if it be deemed fit by the majority of the Arbitrators that the arbitration should be held elsewhere, the arbitration shall, then, be held at the place which is chosen by the majority. The arbitrators; in giving a decision, shall specify an adequate period of delay in which the party adjudged should carry out the said decision; and that party shall be considered to be in default only if that party has failed to conform to the decision prior to the expiry of that period and not otherwise. Condition Seventeenth , All the labourers who are required by the Company in the State of Qatr shall be employed from our subjects or from those persons who are recommended by us; but it is for the Company to bring managers and skilled employees and clerks from outside. Similarly, if the Company should not secure a sufficient number of suitable labourers in the State of Qatr, it can import these from outside. The Company is not justified to keep any employee disapproved by us; but we must not express disapproval except on valid grounds. Condition Eighteenth . I, Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasin-ath-Thani declare that I conclude this Agreement on principles of friend ship and goodwill and that I shall interpret this Agreement in a manner* consistent with reason and truth; and I, Charles Clark ffiylles, declare that the Company acknowledges the Shaikh*s authority and his rights as the Ruler of the State of Qatr ana that it will respect those rights in every way. nn ^lneteenth . This Agreement shall not prevent me from granting concessions to other parties for any article other than the substances mentioned in Condition First; but the terms of such concessions shall not interfere with the rights or the operations of the Company under this Agreement.- 10 Condition Twentiet h. All the moneys due to me according to this Agreement shall be paid by the Company at the from the said Bank, the receipt shall be a complete discharge for the Company in respect to the payment of the sum mentioned in the Bank f s receipt, I may designate another Bank or Banks, as I may wish, to receive payments from the Company; and I shall inform the Company of this in writing. Condition Twenty First . This Agreement shall be binding on the parties, their successors and assigns, and has been written in Arabic and English and all due care has been exercised to ensure that both texts are identical in meaning. Should there be, at any time, disagreement as to the meaning or interpretation of any clause in either text, we and the Company agree to settle the matter by mutual discussion; failing which we shall refer the question to arbitration according to Condition Sixteenth. Condition Twenty Second . The terms, year, month day as used in this Agreement refer to the solar calendar of England and to no other. Agreement has been arrived between us on these conditions on the date mentioned at the prelude of this document; and in witness where we have set our hands thereto; and God is the best watness.

INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, S.W, 1. 11th March 1935. My hear Fowle, Qatar Oil . I enclose copy of a memorandum summarising the corresponaence between Mylles and the A.P.O.C. between 26th February ana 3rd March, which was left with me by Lefroy on 5th Parch, we discussed the points arising on the various articles with the following result; Article 1 . No comment, except that it seems desirable that botn the a«P&lt;iO*C» and the Inula Office shoula see the redraft. Article 2 . The Sheikh’s suggestion that the period must turn upon the financial terms is, of course, a matter of bargaining. Article 3 . poparts on demand. I gather that the Company see no objection. Article 4 . Eoyalty basis to be won and saved as in previous draft. This is the same point as arose in the/ The Hon'ble Lt.Col. T„G. Fowle, C,B*E., Bush ire.- 3 - the case of Koweit. It 3 again, is a case of hargaining. Article 5 . Records on derrand. I gather that the Company see no special objection. Article 6 . It is perhaps reasonable that imports should be through Dohah. If the main oil-bearing structure proves to be in the Jebel Dukhan it would p_rlma facie be more convenient that a special port of export (probably with a pipeline, as in Bahrein) should be agreed on that side of the Qatar Peninsula and I gather that the Company would not see objection to this. But the terms of the sheikh's request are in any event quite reasonable, since the port of export is to be a matter for agreement between the Company and the sheikh. No difficulty arises, I understand, about the use of the Company 1 s facilities for personal or Government business by the sheikh, nor does any special difficulty arise as regards aircraft. (Incidentally, if and when the Company obtain their concession and start to operate in Qatar, we shall have to consider securing from the sheikh an understanding in regard to flights over Qatar, etc. similar to those which we have obtained in Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat.Article 7 . Ttiere need de no question of any Government pressure in regard to trie acquisition of land ? etc. I gather that the Company see no special difficulty about agreeing to reversion to the sheikh, free of cost, of land, etc. surplus during the period of the agreement. Article 8 . Artesian wells. I understand from Lefroy that the A.P.O.C, think it very unlikely that wells if sunk will produce fresh water. But here again I gather that the point is not one of vital importance and that they are likely, if the Sheikn presses the matter, to agree to his request. Article 9 . I gather that no special difficulty arises over this. Article 10 . Imports to he free, hut right to re-export to he covered by a special payment additional to royalty. This, I gather, will he a bargaining point, and attention is invited in connection with it to the Sheikh* s demands in respect of Article 15 as set out in the summary of the telegram from Qatar dated 2nd Iviarch in the A*P.Q.C. summary. Article II . I understand that the A.P-O.O, see no special difficulty about this. Article 12/Article 12 , This proviso that transferee companies shall Pe subject to approval Py the Sheikh, coupled with the intimation on the same Article in the telegram from Qatar of 2nd March that only one suPsidiary company will Pe permitted, is 5 I gather, taken rather seriously Py the A.P.O.C,, who are, of course, Pound to transfer to the I*P,C. any concession which they may oPtain. The question was not discussed in any detail with Lefroy, Put I gathered they have in mind the possibility of establishing a Qatar Oil Company which would Pe a suPsidiary of the I,P.C, and to which the concession could Pe transferred to Pe worked, with the Sheikh’s approval, once it had been obtained by the A.P.O.C. Article 15 , I gather that the Company have in mind a variation of the Sheikh’s counter suggestion on this to the effect that termination will Pe possible only within three years of the date of the agreement (which is, of course, a very different thing from the date of the commencement of operations). I pointed this out to Lefroy, Put did not go beyond that in our conversation. The sheikh can Pe relied on to look after his own interests on this. Article 14 . It seems desirable that both we and the A.P.Q.C# should see the redraft, though if if is a 'redraft/'redraft without alteration of the sense' no special difficulty need he anticipated. Article 15 , I gather that the Company agree. Article 1 6 of telegram of 16th February, From the telegram of 28th February you will see that the sheikh has now agreed to the retention of the refertnce to the Political Resident. Article 17 . The Company, I-gather from Lefroy, do not at all like this and feel that if the. Sheikh is to be at liberty to disapprove of 'any employee' and if the Company are thereupon to be bound to dismiss him, they may find themselves in a difficult position, I said that here, as elsewhere, it seemed desirable for the Company, if they wished to get this concession, to meet the Sneikh on all points that were not entirely fundamental, but that possibly they might think it worth while asking lylies to get a rather clearer definition from the Sheikh of the precise type of employee to whom he wished to be in a position to object. He might wish for a completely free hands he might, on the other hand, be chiefly concerned to be able to object to individual Arabs or other native employees. I gather that the Company will probably ao this. Article 18/T~- Article 18 . Here, as in the case of Articles 1 and 14, it seems desirable that HAuG* and the A.P.O.C. should see the redraft, so as to ensure that there is in fact no alteration of sense. Article 21 . As the result of discussion with the Company it has already been agreed that as the sheikh apparently knows only Arabic and has nobody in his service who has a fluent knowledge of English, there are special reasons for allowing the Arabic text to prevail. 2. 'question of local refinery . The demand for a local refinery (which would have been very acceptable to the Admiralty) appears to have been dropped (compare telegram of 28th February on Article 16 from Qatar). 3 0 Telegram from Qatar of 2nd March ., Article 11 . I said to Lefroy that tha- company, under the terms of this article, v\/ere already required to pay the wages of the guards who were to be appointed in consultation with the sheikh, that the Sheikh under the terms of his Treaty was precluded from obtaining arms, save with the approval of HAvl.G. , but that HAvnG. would raise no objection to arms (after consultation with the Political Resident, being imported in sufficient quantities to equip the guards, but for no other purpose, so long as this/7 this was done through the proper channels. Article 15. I gather that the Company see no difficulty about f orce majeure involving delay of operations in Qatar only. We see no objection to payment in rupees. The question of annual payments in addition to royalty to cover exemption from customs duties, etc. and the right to re-export is a matter for bargaining. 4 - As regards the substantial gift, I gather (though Lefroy will not probably wish to be quoted) that rumours, which are thought to emanate from Holmes, have been spread locally, the most moderate of which is to the effect th^t the sheikh of Koweit received 45,000 rupees as a peroonal gift on the conclusion of his contract, find that this has sent up the sheikh of Qatar’s demands. The Company are, if appears, prepared to consider a substantial gift rather on Qatar lines, b- It is most satisfactory that the company should obtain an extension of the option until 4th May. The Company appear to be a good deal disturbed about Holmes’ alleged contacts with the sheikh. Lefroy mentioned (again I am not sure that he will wish to be quoted) that it had been ascertained throuji the local postal authorities that a letter addressed by Holmes to the sheikh had been received in Qatar and that other letters/letters addressed to the sheihh had been received from Mohamad Yattim. They attach great importance to preventing him from visiting Qatar if, as Mylles remarks in his telegram, 'repetition of the Koweit experience is to he avoided'. 7 0 I am sending a copy of this letter to the political Agent, Bahrein and to the Government of India.

The file also concerns preliminary oil explorations in Qatar, and the subsequent suspension of operations on the orders of the British Government.The papers cover: discussion, drafts and text of the commercial agreement between the Shaikh of Qatar and APOC (signed 17 May 1935); discussion, draft and text of the political agreement between HM Government and APOC (signed 5 June 1935); the use by the Shaikh of modern, Egyptian Arabic to make comments on the draft (folios 624-625); British support for the proposal that disputes between foreign employees of the company and inhabitants of Qatar should not be submitted to the Shara [Sharia] courts (folio 604); intelligence on the activities of the Standard Oil Company [California-Arabia Standard Oil Company] (e.g. folio 443); British emphasis that military protection would be afforded to the Shaikh of Qatar on condition that he awarded the oil concession to APOC, and the assumption by Britain of responsibility for the protection of Qatar (e.g. folios 400-403); the transfer of the concession from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited (e.g. folios 335-357); the payment of salaries to the Shaikh's representatives (e.g. folios 294-295); water drilling operations by the company (e.g. folios 237-241); references to Qatar's disputed border with Saudi Arabia; reports of preliminary drilling results and first discoveries of oil (1939-41); employment of foreign personnel by Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar (folios 180-182); the suspension of drilling operations on the orders of HM Government in 1942 as a result of war conditions, including correspondence on the subject between British officials and the Shaikh of Qatar, 1942-43; note that the suspension had been ordered because the British military authorities were unable to spare sufficient personnel to ensure the destruction of the oil wells, should the military situation demand it (folio 41); correspondence dated 1944 concerning a proposed increase in world oil refining capacity; and further correspondence dated 1944 concerning the boundary between Qatar and Bahrain at Hawar Island.The main correspondents are senior officials at the India Office, representatives of the oil companies concerned, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The Arabic language content of the file consists of approximately 30 folios of correspondence, largely between British officials and the Ruler of Qatar.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
