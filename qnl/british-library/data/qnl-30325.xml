Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have recently had under consideration the question of periodical inspection oi landing grounds in the Persian Gulf and on the Arabian Coast. 2. The normal practice, within this Command, is lor inlorma- tion regarding all landing grounds to he tabulated and kept up to date through visits of inspection by the squadrons made responsible for the areas in which t£e landing grounds are located. By this means, information is readily at hand regarding the condition of the landing grounds, and arrangements can readily be made to remedy any defects revealed. 3. I have decided tint No.84 (B) Squadron, Shaibah, should be the Squadron responsible for the inspection of landing grounds in the Gulf area, and for co-ordinating information in regard to them. As, however, one flight oi this Squadron, xxx together with one flight of No.55 (B)Squadron, and a single aircraft of No.70 (B.T.) Squadron, are in future to make flights down the Gulf each month, I do not propose that any special inspection flights should be made. Reliance will be placed on these routine trips and any other visits which may take place, to keep me informed as to the state of the landing grounds • 4. In making No.84 (B)Squadron responsible for co-ordinating information about the landing grounds in the Gulf area, I feel that this Squadron should now be placed on the same tootin^ as No.203 (F.3.)Squadron as regards flying in the Gulf area. That is, that no sanction will be required for flights in the Gulf area by No.84 (B)Squadron flt'om this Headquarters, but application for approval will be made direct to you. No.203 (F.3.)Squadron will be kept informed by No.84 ,(B) Squadron. 5. I should be glad to learn whether this arrangement will be satisfactory to you.

Air Facilities on Arab Coast of the i argiyi j£kM.± Dear Colonel, witli reference to your letter fro*C/62 of 1935 dated 19th March 1936, and to the discussion with the Air Officer CoMmanding ‘Iraq on 18th fcay 1936, I have to make the following observetions i- KUWAIT • The facilities which will be required at this place will consist of a floodlight-beacon to be provided by the Air ?&amp;inistry, and at the saiae time, Imperial Airways have asked for a refuelling shelter. I am not quite clear as to the precise form which this shelter will take, but I do not suppose that it will be much more tnan a screen or wall serving as a wind-creak* It may prove desirable to lay down a hard runway, but a definite decision on this point cannot be made the at the present time* as described by Mr* ijaitwietle, it is desirable that a meteorological observation station should be established at Kuwait* Subject to the concurrence of the India Meteorological Department. Hr.iintwistle suggests that suitable men of local origin should be trained in making observations, and paid for their services* It is quite possible that the establishment of such a station will involve securing a small plot ior the erection of a meteorological office and for the installation of the instruments used for observation* I understand that you consider the employment of local talent would be very desirable* BAHRAIN. It is probable that the facilities at Bahrain will need to be‘ extended* Additions may have to be made to the W/T Station, as it will be necessary to substitute Adcock dir action-finding equipment for the existing Eellini-Tosi. The signal station will also have to keep longer hours of watch. This will result in an increase in staff, and presumably an increase in living accommoda tion* It may also be found necessary to provide extended facilities for passengers. It is very hard at the moment to translate such expansion into terms of buildings, land, etc* 1 IaLlL • As indicated in the schedules forwarded, requirements at this island are confined to the location of an airway beacon. This will be of the 'unattended' type, out naturally will have to be visited i*om time to time. From R.A.F. information it is clear that it is impracticable / Lieut*-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.l., The Hon’ble Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire •-2- impracticable to conatruct an aarodrome on this Island. .... 'LtLti&amp;t-JsL * 4 It will be necessary to instal an airway beacon of the M unattended' type on this island* Subject to final confirmation from the Air Ministry, a landing ground will not i be needed* The provision of additional accommodation for passengers is at present under consideration* extension of the W/T organisation will probably necessitate still further accommodation* At present I understand that in your judgment j conditions do not permit of the construction of such accommoda- tion outside the fort* KALBA . An emergency landing ground with a petrol store, and possibly some sort of shelter for passengers is required* i From information available, the provision of such a ground would appear to be easier tt Kalba than at Dibah, although should, for any reason, it prove impossible to proceed with Kalba, Dibah might be substituted. The ground at Kalba would be m used only in case of an emergency, but would need to be of dimensions adequate for the requirements of civil aircraft, and would have to be maintained up to the proper standard* Maintenance, of course, would not be the responsibility of the Shaikh. It is desirable that an airway beacon ('un attended' type) should be erected at ) alba/Dibah* DEBAI - RAS AL KHAIMAH . Imperial Airways have actually asked for DebAi as their refuelling halt, but in view of the experience of the Royal Air Force, it would appear that Ras al Khaimah is better suited for such purpose* The alighting area at Debai is confined, and under certain conditions of tide and wind, it would be difficult to take off a heavily loaded flying boat* This will be brought to the notice of Imperial Airways, and the Company will be advised to establish their refuelling halt at Ras al Khaimah in preference to Debai* At whichever site is finally selected, it will be necessary to arrange for facilities for passengers* This is the commercial responsibility of the Company, and will probably mean the provision of some form of craft, suitably fitted, lying at anchor, or a building on shura* The petrol company catering for the aircraft will also need storage facilities* W/T facilities will also have to be arranged between the refuelling point and the main signal station at Sharjah* This may involve the establishment of a small W/T Station ashore, or possibly it may be found convenient to locate this on board a suitable vessel* Moorings will need to be laid for the use of seaplanes, and the Air Ministry would arrange for the provision of a control boat to be provided. These vessels will periodically have to be brought ashore for cleaning and overhaul, etc* The above organisation will necessitate the employment of a considerable number of individuals for whom housing will have to be provided. It is understood that arrangements have already been made / 2*~7“T ‘ **• ■■i -3- — / r made for the following:- ABU DHABI. YAS Airway beacon. Airway beacon and landing ground. 3. GWADUR ' As explained, it will be necessary to extend iry i the W/T and meteor organisations at Gwadur. This will involve additional buildings and masts in the vicinity of the town and of the aerodrome. The precise scheme is in process of f emulation. 4. I trust the above will give you a satisfactory outline of the programme which it is proposed to develop. As stated at the discussion, I will endeavour to get from Imperial Air ways as definite a statement as possible df the facilities for which their Company is responsible, but you will appreciate the difficulty of indicating in advance precise details. 5.

In thie connection I am to forward herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, a revised schedule setting out the additional facilities which, it is expected, will be required in the Persian Gulf during the next two years. This schedule should be regarded as in substitution for that enclosed with Air Ministry letter to your department dated 18th January last, S.34954/36. 3. With regard to the observations in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the express letter dated 19th March last from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I am to say that, while the attached schedule sets out the complete require ments ao far ts they can at present be estimated, some minor modifications may be involved as « result of further consideration of the requirements of the air service. 4.

B *ation on the hillock, aoproyiina+ely 900 yarda north-eaat of the Me at-house, and a building to house the renote control,wireless transmitters, approximately 900 yards north-eant of the Meat-houae, is eonteroolated at an early date. ’’’he two proposed build in/fa would be about 1300 yards nmrt and, aa already seated, each 900 yards from the Meat-House. Neither are, strictly sneaking, ^additional facilities' but are improved 'wodels 1 * the existing T\/^. and W/T. stations which are now installed ILt/b.in the Heat-house. By locating them at some distance from the Meat-house much greeter efficiency rill result. In this connection the question of the defence of the two new buildings arises. Personally, I feel that the local conditions at Sharjah are now such that no npecial arrangements are needed and that it should suffice for the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Inform the Ohalkh of the removal of the W/T. stations to the points mentioned above and get hin assurance Iki! G.'ft. Crombie, ^squire, India Office, WHITEHALL, D.W.l.that they Till be adequately covered b^r the defence Behewe non in force in Hharjah. We ahould, therefore, like to inntruct the Air Officer Oowwandinp, Iran, to inyestlgate the (mention of the defence of these two new buildings (in consultation with the Resident) so that we can as noon as posBible assure the Director General of Oivil Aviation that he need have no qualiae as to the security of the two new bulldlnga* Will rrnu let we have your views? ^'ours sincerely, (f?d) n.C.

(e) ffhe case nay arise where additional facilities involve the construction of buildinge, */T nhste etc., on land outside the liaits of the aerodrome. In this eeee alee there is ne question of obtaining pernisaion for the right to instal the facilities. The question of the ownership ef the land, however, does arise, ae the Bite required nay be (l) mat. laud, or (2) cultivated or occupied land.

The Kulor aeuld be Infor.ed that tue site «ae required, and the burden of proving thet ite uee would infr Ingo a public right (oueh ae right of way) or a private easement would lie on the Ruler. in the case of (£) a similar procedure would bo followed with the addition that compensation would h&amp;vo to be paid for the uee ef the site. 4 4. The foregoing, relates to additional facilities to existing Aerodrome#. In the case of additional civil aero dromes being required a distinction exists between our rights under the Civil Air Agreements with the Hulere of Kuwait, iahrai n and Muscat on the one hand, and of Sh»rjah on the ether, in the ease of the former we have the right to establish mere than /-3- »®r«i th^n on« aerodrome f'nd tha coneldarat ion» In paragraph 3 above would apply In the eaee of any freeh el tee required, la the oaee of the latter the Agreement relatee only to the eite eel acted and now In uae, ana any additional aerodromes will require to fee freehly negotiated lor. , yr v 6. fhe opinion ie expreeeed in th|r eeoond paraipraph of Air Kinietry letter Ko.423a24/35/;Co.i, dated the sand etober 193b, that it ahould suffice for me to inform the Shaihli of Sharjah of the removal of the l/f station to the new attea proposed and to get hie aeaurance that they sill be adequately covered by the Defence Scheme now in force in Sharjah.
