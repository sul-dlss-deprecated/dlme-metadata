D.O.No.1278-10/12 0 28th July 1935. Subject: Cultured Pearls -*p I send you herewith a copy of a letter I have received from Shaikh ^ir Hamad hin Isa al Khalifah, K.O.I.n.,, C.S.I. 2. With paragraphs 1 to 3 I am in full agreement. As regards paragraph 4. fhe facts as set forth in it are correct in so far as the frucial Shaikhs are concerned. They all approached me during my recent tour of the Coast to protect them but none of them displayed any readiness for an Order in Council by reason of which such protection would be possible. It is very much a question of tT G-od helps those who help themselves” and they won T t do that, by themselves dealing with the Cultured pearl seller. Although the cultured pearls come from Japan through Bombay the traffickers are Najdis or other Arabs who are the Agents of the Bombay firms concerned. Two much men were known to and could have been caught red handed by the Shaikh of Dibai in May this year. He complained bitterly to me that the Great British Government was not protecting him but omitted to mention that if he had of his own accord punished them the trouble would have obviated. Instead I with very limited powers as compared to his was left to convict the same Najdis for offences in Bahrain. sd/- G. A.

If a man is caught actually selling cultured pearls as real, he can be dealt with under Jection 420 of the Indian lenal Cede, but it may not be easy to detect or to prove a case of this kind* it is, therefore, desirable to lay down a much heavier punishment for the offence of the importation into Bahrain or of being in possession of cultured pearls, as so doing would as a rule be only with the object of fraud. 4. The Bahrain Gov rument are constdering the purchase of a pearl testing machine, though the cost is, I understand, high. If this proves possible, the existence of the machine should serve to some extent as a deterrent to persons trying to pass cultured pearls as real, and would in any case render certain the detection of cultured pearls in any doubtful case. 5. X recommend that the punishment of five gears’ rigorous imprisonment suggested by His Excellency may be adopted. 1 would, however, place no limit on the fine as cultured pearls representing fraudulent dealings of possibly lacs of rupees may be imported by a rich merchant to whom a limited fine would be r3. lottlfc consequenoe. Moreover, a limit to the fin© may in some cases preclude the possibility of repaying persons who have been defrauded# 6. X enclose a draft King’s Regulation and recommend that it should be issued* 7* His Excellency also suggests that steps should be taken to punish the Introduction of cultured pearls into the other States of the Arab Littoral, Kuwait* Qatar and Truclal ’Oman* X entirely agree in principle and the rulers of „atsr and the Trueial Shaikhs hay© already been warned in conversation of this danger to pearl trado* 8. I am sending a copy of this correspondanoa to the Political Agent* Kuwait with the request that he will consult His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad oin Jabir A1 a abah with a view to taking similar action to that which is proposed for Bahrain* 9. Tne question of action on the i’ruoial Coast is more difficult* hut I hope to have an opportunity of consulting the various Trueial Shaikhs on a tour In October* 10. There would remain a gap on the Coast, that is to say, the pearling centres of 3e'nil Arabia. These centres are not of great importance, but it may become necessary later on to seek the cooperation of the ~i&amp;3udi Arab Covernmen t # 11* In the meantime* 1 trust that Government will feel disposed to take the action proposed for Bahrain without waiting 'she rp.-sult of enquiries elsewhere* Bahrain is the centre of the pearl trade and action there will encourage the Rulers of the Crucial Coast to take steps themselves* i would only add that4. the danger is a pressing one - if it cnee heec; es thought that cultured pearls may he found mixed with the pearl catch of the Persian aulf, the good name ol the trade xvill receive a blow from which it may never recover. j 12.

His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad wishes to obtain work which could be given to his own subjects. Such persons have been prosecuted in the Agency Court in the past and those who are working were fined and allowed to remain, others have been dis charged by the court and have remained here. I am of the opinion that in the neighbourhood of 3000 such Persians have entered Bahrain during this (Arabic) year most of whom are now working at the Jebel. In order to prevent any more such persons entering Bahrain I enquire whether it would be possible for the Court to approve repatriation of a number of Persians if cases are made against them by this Government. If no example is made I fear that the proportion of Persians working at the Jebel who have entered Bahrain illegally will rapidly increase which is undesirable both politically and locally. H. B.

Such craft are searched on arrival at Bahrain, and the nukhudha declares what rifles and ammunition are in his possession. These are deposited in the Customs against receipt; and on the departure of the vessel are restored to the v Nukhudha. This system has worked satisfactorily, and is believed to prevent arms from entering Bahrain illicitly. I would not recommend a variation of this practice; as any change would be likely to cause delay and inconvenience to the native craft. DIRE and PORT OFFICER.

By order of Hatned Bin Isa Alkhalifall Of Bahrain IDated 8th May 1931?./ India Office Whitehall, S.W.l. 29th June, 1937. Dear Brenan, Will you please refer to your letter of the 2nd June, No.E.2793/1913/91, regarding the proposal to issue a King's Regulation under Article 70 of the Bahrein Order in Council prohibiting the entry into Bahrein of persons who are without passports or visas. 2. As regards Beckett's first point, the position is that the Bahrein authorities require that the passport of any person wishing to land shall bear a visa. Since, however, Bahrein has no officials abroad who can give such visas, the service is performed for the Bahrein Government by British officials. The existing instructions to this effect are contained in Foreign Office circular No.T.2117/ 593/378 of the 10th March, 1932, and will be reproduced in the revised circular which is now under consideration In such circumstances it seems to us that the existing wording of Article 1 is adequate for the purpose required, but if Beckett still considers it desirable that there should be some more explicit reference in the King's V. Brenan, Esq.., O.B.E., Foreign Office, S.W.l. Regulation/V Regulation, we should see no objection to inserting after 'valid visa for Bahrein' the words 'according to the practice and instructions from time to time in force' if that would meet his view. 3, Beckett's second point refers to an obvious flaw in the draft Regulation'but we suggest that this might be dealt with by the addition of the following words at the end of Articles 2 and 5:- 'and any direction or order for such removal shall be deemed to be an order to which the provisions of Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, as amended by the Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council, 1924, are applicable'. 4 , With regard to the last paragraph of Beckett's note, it is understood that his attention has since been drawn to the Bahrein (Amendment) Order of 1924 which brings the ‘original Order much more nearly into line with the corresponding provisions (Articles 24-26) of the Kuwait Order in Council of 1935. 5 , We hope that in the light of the foregoing it will be possible to push on with the 'Allowance' of the draft King's Regulation as soon as possible. It will suffice/o. suffice from our point of view if you mention in your official reply to our letter of the 19th May the amendments 'which have been made n after demi-official consultation'. Yours sincerely* &gt;s a m w hP.Z.3612/37. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. (E.2793/1913/91) 2nd June, 1937. Dear Symon, Will you please refer to India Office letter P.Z.1551/37 of the 19th May regarding the proposal to issue a King’s Regulation under Article 70 of the Bahrain Order in Council, prohibiting the entry into Bahrain of persons who are without passports or visas. Beckett has some observations to offer on the draft King’s Regulation which formed the enclosure to India Office letter P.Z.1551 of the 7th April, and / before we proceed further it seems simplest to send you herewith a copy of his minute on the subject to enable you to consider such amendments to the proposed King's Regulation as may be necessary in the light of his observations. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) T. V. Brenan. 0. B. Symon, Esq..Copy (E 2^3/1915/91) Before we take steps to get this draft King’s Regulation printed etc* I think we must refer to the India Office on the following points: (i) It would appear desirable that the expression M valid visa” should be defined* Who are the persons for instance who are entitled to give a valid visa for Bahrein? (2) Both Articles 2 and 5 provide that a person may be ordered to remove himself from Bahrein or may be removed, but I am not clear whether it has been sufficiently thought out how this is to be done in practice and whether further provisions are not necessary in the King’s Regulation. It is of course simple for the court to make an Order telling a man to leave Bahrein and if he goes within the time limit, all is well* If he fails to remove himself and it is found that this is the result of a contempt of the order, I presume he renders himself liable to farther penalties for a second breach of the order and that an order may time be made removing him, but how is this compulsory removal to be effected? Presumably he will be put upon a ship but is it necessary to have any provision compelling ships to take such persons and who is to pay for the cost of removal? I should have thought that it ought to be provided that the person to be removed should pay if he can and I presume that if he cannot the cost is defrayed from Bahrein funds. Th n the question has to be thought of as to what place he is to be removed to. If he possesses a nationality presumably he must be removed to the country to which he belongs, but if it cannot be established that he belongs to any country presumably no order removing him cani tie Tnpde effective. I think the India Office will want to consider these noints. It would be natural to make use of the orovisions of the Order in Council with regard to denortation, namely, articles 22 to 24, and the India Offj[ ce might look at these Articles in this connexion. At the same time we should call their attention to the fact that the Articles, particularly Article 22 (4), are really all based unon the aseumntion that the persons to be deported will all be British subjects or protected persons and as this assumption is not necessarily justified the Article is not really very adequate for the jurisdiction which we exercise in Bahrein and this fact is a further reason why an up to date Bahrein Order in Council should be drafted. We have previously called the attention of the India Office to the fact that the Order of 1913 really is out of date and that for the purposes of its amendment reference might be made to the recent Orders with regard to Koweit and Qatar (Sgd. ) W* Beckett. 26th May, 1937.By Air Mail.

The position is briefly as follows. The Political Agent in exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrain can only apply (a) the Bahrain Order in Council, as ameiided from time to time; (b) British and Indian Acts made applicable under the Order in Council and (c) King^ Regulations made under Article 70 of the Bahrain Order in Council. It is true that under Article 74 of the Order in Council the Political Agent can enforce the observance of ,f any reasonable custom &lt; existing in Bahrain”, but this is insufficient to enable to deal with offences against modern Regulations such as the Motor Vehicles Regulations, Passport Regulations etcetera. 3. As a preliminary, therefore, to any attempt at codi fying the Bahrain Government Regulations on various subjects, it would be most desirable for the Adviser and the Political Agent to examine jointly any suggested series of Regulations covering particular subjects. This would enable the Political Agent to see whether we have any similar Regulations applying to foreigners already in existence and, if not, what would be the best method of aligning the Agency and the Bahrain Govern ment. 4. A copy of the Indian Motor Vehicles Act has been ordered from Bombay to see whether it can be applied to Bahrain and when it is received 1 will discuss the matter with you further. C. Dairymple BeIgrave, Esquire, C.B.K., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain, 5/-5* In regard to Passport Regulations we already have a King*s Regulation to cover these and it is unnecessary to consider its amendment. In fact, it would be unjusti fiable to expect that His Majesty^ Government would at present even think of any amendment. Yours sincerely.D.G. No. -m. i/ll Dated the 29th May 1938. &gt; Dear Belgrave, As I promised I send you herewith a copy of my propo sals for control of motor vehicles in Bahrain. 2. It begins with a note which I propose to forward to the Political Hesident in due course, after ascertaining your views; it sets out a draft Regulation for the use of the Ag-ncy and a draft Schedule for the use of the Bahrain Government; and it contains suggestions for rule© to be made under these two.

Pending the approval of His Majesty’s Government, of course, there is no point in the Bahrain Government issuing their Proclamation and Rules as they would apply, for the time being, only to Bahrain subjects. We want to ensure simultaneous action by you and by us so that foreigners and Bahrain subjects alike come under the new Rules from the same date* Yours sincerely, W. B.

A POLICE DEPARTMENT. NO .P/3/57 Bahrain. 21st Tune, 1938 Dated: . 22nd R/Thani,1357 From:- The Commandant St cate Police, Bahrain. His Britannic Majesty ! s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, Subjectt-Licensing, etc. of motor vehicle* in the State of Bahrain. I have the honour to state that the Bahrain Government is desirous of issuing a Proclamation and Rules, to control the licensing, registeration, and use of motor vehicles and their drivers in the -tete. The Proclamation and Rules to be in accordance with the drafts prepared in conjunction with His Britannic Majesty 1 Political Agent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, copies of which are attached to this letter. If the approval of His Majesty’s Government is obtained, the Bahrain Government proposes to issue the Proclamation and Rules at the same time as a lv ing s Regulation identical with it, so that ooth Bahraini and foreign subjects are notified simultaneously. I have the Honour to be Commandant State Police.Political Agency, Bahrain, the 26th June 1938 No. -5/11 I From H. Weightman, Ksquire, I*C«S#, Political Agent, Bahrain* To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, C/0 Postmaster, Karachi. Sir, I have the honour to say that it is becoming more and more urgent to undertake some legislation for the li censing, registration and control of motor drivers and their vehicles in Bahrain. Accidents have been distressingly fre quent and there have been several deaths. In Bahrain there are considerably more foreign than native o-wners and drivers, and the regulations so far operated by the Bahrain Government have been of no legal value for the control of such foreign ers. Hitherto the Political Agent had had to rely solely on the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, which, while adequate for the punishment of rash and negligent driving, are value less for any real control or for the devising of precau tionary measures. 2. I had at first thought of suggesting the application of the Indian Motor Vehicles Act together with a Motor Vehi cles Tax Act and rules under both Acts, but after further examination I have come to the conclusion that this would be unnecessarily cumbersome and that it might raise diffi culties in ensuring identical legislation by the Bahrain Government for their own subjects. I am now of the opinion that the simplest method is to draft a King 1 s Regulation, utilising/-- 2 - /5&gt; utilising the precedents in procedure of ’’The Possession and Traffic in Anas Regulation 1936” and ”The Bahrain Law regard ing the Ownership of Immovable Property in Bahrain by Foreign ers Regulation 1937”. The schedule to this King*s Regulation would b e a Proclamation issued by the Bahrain Government and I submit herewith drafts of both. The basis for the draft Regulation is the 'effective” part of the Indian Motor Vehicles Act, and it will be observed that the draft Regulation and the Schedule provide for rules to be made by the Political Agent and the Bahrain Government respectively. 3. I have been in consultation with the Bahrain Government on this matter, and they are in agreement with me in consider ing that the proposed action is necessary and accept the draft Proclamation. I have further drafted a set of rules, again in consultation with the Bahrain Government, and these dra t rules are attached herewith for information. I enclose also a copy of a letter No. P/3/57 dated the 21st JUne 1938 from the ConH mandant, State Police, Bahrain (in the absence of the Adviser on leave) making an official request that action should be taken on the lines indicated above. 4. It may be considered that the provision in the draft Regulation that rules should be framed by the Political Agent implies too great a devolution of power to the Political Agent, but I suggest that this is preferable to overlording the King^ Regulation or its schedule with detailed rules which may require revision from time to time, each such revision in volving a revised King’s Regulation. By the action taken the convention has been established that Agency and Bahrain Govern ment rules should be drafted in concert by the Political Agent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and from the draft rules themselves it will be seen that such rules are in fact (and will continue to be) based on similar rules in force in India or elsewhere in the British Empire./i V 5* I request therefore that, if you approve, His Majes ty* s Government may he moved to sanction the issue of a King’s Regulation with a schedule on the lines suggested at the earliest possible date* The matter is of some ur gency in order to ensure that the present lack of control over motor drivers and owners of motor vehicles should not be allowed to c ontinue.

Dairympie Belgrave Adviser to the Government• Y.G.H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - His Highness Shaikh Salman has recently received a letter from the Kadis protesting at the increase of immorality in Bahrain and implying that it is encouraged by foreigners. The Kadis particularly mention the bla tant behaviour of public prostitutes, who now parade about the streets, and the growth of the liquor habit among Moslems. His Highness has considered the matter and has ordered the Police to restrict prostitutes to the bro thel area and to prevent their using public vehicles. With regard to liquor His Highness has instructed me to enquire from you whether it would be possible for the Agency Courts to deal with liquor cases with simi lar severity as is shown in such cases in the Bahrain Court. In the Bahrain Court persons who are convicted of distilling liquor are punished by 8 months R.I. if it is the first offence, if they are convicted again they receive double this sentence. Persons found in possession of or selling liquor are given 6 months R.I. in case of a first offence. 5Tj /(In Adviser to the Government. S.Z.Ho. jPolitical Agency, Bahrain, 17th June 194Z. To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. Memorandum . Reference para 2 of your memorandum Ho.862/25- 9A, dated 14th May 1942. 1 regret that it is not at present legally possible for me to deal with liquor offences with the same severity as the Bahrain Courts. In order for Agency Courts to be armed with the necessary powers it will bo necessary to issue a King's Regulation applying i&gt;o foreigners, mutafis mutandis and making an exception in favour of permit holders, the Bahrain proclamation on the sutycct. If you will let me have a copy of the Bahrain laws, rules or regulations on this subject, I will see what can be done to have them made applicable to foreigners. I may add that I am fully in sympathy with His Highness’ policy in this matter and that, pending the time when the law applicable to foreigners becomes identical with that which^hpplicable to Bahrain subjects, offences of which the Agency Courts take cognisance will be dealt with as Beverly as the existing law allows. Polrtical Agent, Bahrain,7^7 Offences against the Defence Regulation Ko.l of ly42 fg) are triable under Article 12 of the Regulation, according to part III of the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913 as far as they may be applicable. Putt III of the Bahrain Order in Council (Art.l4-(1) lays down (a) that, subject to the other provisions of this Order (B.O.C.), the Code of Criminal Procedure and the otiier enactments relating to the administration of criminal justice in British India for the time being shall be applicable to Bahrain; (b) that the Political Agent at Bahrain shall be deemed to be the District Magistrate and the Sessions Judge; and t (c) that the powers of the Governor General in Council and the local Government under those enactments (i,e. Cr.P.C. and other acts relating to criminal justice in British India) shall be exercisable by the Secretary of State, or, with his previous or subsequent oon^o^t^ by the Governor General Ay of India in Council. 2 8 Under Section 190-(2) Criminal Procedure Code^the Local Government(in our case, Secretary of State or, with his previous or subsequent assent, the Governor General of India; vide Article 14 -(1) B.O.C^) may empower any Magistrate to take cognizance^ under Sub-Section (1), clause (a) or clause (b)^of offences which he may try or xhhxxx* commit for trial , Clause (a) to Sub-Section (1) pertains to taking cognizance of an offence upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence Section of the law under which a- complaint,can be entertained by H.M’s Magistrates in Bahrain. Clause (b) to Sub-Section (l) relates to a report of the facts constituting an offence made by a Police Officer and does not concern oui present enquiry.- 2 - 3 . Tho offences against Defence Regulation No.X of 1942, as provided by Article 4 of the said Regulation, are punishable up to 14 years* imprisonment^ and are offences against the State. The Indian Penal Code is one of the 'enactments relating to criminal justice in British Ind:u» (Article 14-( 1) B.O.C.), aa^/^iso one of the enactments of the Govemior General which have been made applicable to Bahrain under Article 11-(1) B.O.C. read with the Schedule to B.O.G* and on the principles of which, and in conformity with which, H.M.*s criminal jurisdiction in Bahrain is exercisablec According to the Indian Penal Code, all offences against the State which are punishable with 7 or 10 years* imprisonment are triable exclusively by the Court of Sessions vide Chapter YI viz: Section 121A ( conspiracy to emmmit offences punishable under Section 121 I.P.C.: 10 years) Section 122 (collecting arms with intent to wage war against ^ueen: 10 years) Section 123 (concealing with intent to facilitate war against &lt;iueen: 10 years) .Section 124 (assaulting Governor General: 7 years) ^'Section 128 (Public servant allowing prisoner of war to escape: 10 years)- Section 130 (aiding escape of prisoner of war : 10 years) Section 131 (abetting mutiny 5 xfxAyjttxxxxw{ ebqx^^ieAxx 10 years) Section 132 (abetting mutiny, if latter committed:10 years Consequently the offences against Defence Regulation No.l of 1942 which are punishable with 14 years* imprisonment, the longest term of imprisonment authorised by law (vide Section 55 I.P.C.) can es^ be trio/i by the Sessions Court (i.e. by the P.A.’s Court) 4 . The procedure in enquiries preparatory to commitment has been laid down in Chapter XVIII (s.s.206 - 219) Criminal P.C. According to Section 206 (l^any Magistrate of the 1st Class may commit any person for trial to tire Court of Session or High Court for any offence triable by such Court. The Indian Assistant has already been inwested with powers of a Magistrate of the 1st Class under Scchdule IV and we have applied for similar powers for A.P.A. Either of them can therefore entertain (i.e. take cognizance of) the complaint from Bapco for an offence under Article 4 of the Defence Regulation-3- No.l of 1942 on the r^uthority of Sub-Section (2) of Section 190 Cr.P.C. and Sub-Section (1), clause (a) ibid (vide^para 2 above) read with Section 37 Cr-P.C. and item No.3 (First class Magistrates) of Schedule IV to Cr.P.C. and commit the case for trial to Session’s Court (i.e. P.A’s Court). 5. But P.A., apart from being a Sessions Judge, is also a District Magistrate under Article 14 -(1) B.O.C. Section 30 Cr.P.C. empowers the Local Government (in our case the Secretary of State or, with his previous or subsequent assent the Governor General of India in Council; vide Article 14-(1) ^ B.O.C.) to invest a District Magistrate in certain try as a Magistrate all offences not punishable with death. The Section does not cover the territories of the Shaikh of Bahrain, but the powers of the Section have been made extendable to Bahrain by King’s Regulation No.2 of 1930 which authorises the Local Government (vide above for definition of Local Government in our case) to invest P.A. Bahrain, as District Magistrate, with powers to try as a Magistrate all offences not punishable with death. The investment was actually made by the Governor General in 1941 (p,191, file 5/11) at our request^/was confirmed by the Secretary of State (p.193 ibid). The advantage of Section 30 Cr.p.c. and the King’s Regulation made thereunder is that they waive the necessity of calling assessors as desired by s.s.268 and 284 Cr.P.C. and^conducting the case by the Public Prosecutor^* (s.270 Cr.P.C). and if P.A. wishes to exercise jurisdiction under the said Section and the said King’s Regulation, ts-eirc will be no need for A.P.A. or I.A. to take cognizance of the offence and f 11 commit it for trial to Sessions Court but P.A^/hiay take cognizance of it as a Magistrate like A.P.A. or I.A. as discussed at the end of para 4 above. On the other hand, if P.A. does not wish to exercise his powers under this King’s Regulation he is at liberty^ to do so as Section 30, the King’s Regulation and the Governor General’s investment t of power are all discretionary and not mandatory. TheIf the case is tried 'by P.A. as District Magistrate under Section 30, the appeal shall lie to the High Court under proviso (b) to Section 408 provided if the P.A, passqjf any sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding 4 years, or any sentence of transportation. But if he (i) passes a sentence shorter than 4 years imprisonment or (ii) does not pass a sentence Af transportation the answer is not so simple and needs elucidation. 2. Ordinarily, appeals from the sentences of the District Magistrates should lie to the Sessions Court under Section 408y and the provisions of Section 408 read with proviso ^ quoted under para 1 above lead to the conclusion that appeals from Bentences not covered by the said proviso may also lie to the Sessions Court. But P.A. is both the District Magistrate and the Sessions Judge (Art.14-(1) B.O.C.); and appeals from his own sentences as District ^ Magistrate cannot lie to him as Sessions Judg^/. It may be argued that it is not necessary that the P.A. himself should hear the appeal because appeals to Sessions Judge can also be heard by an Additional Sessions Judge i»e. the Judicial Assistant to the P.R. (the Secretary) under Section 409 Cr.P.C. read with Art.l4-(1) B.O.C. But the argument is not sound because, under proviso to s.409, an Additional Sessions Judge shall hear only such appeals as (i) the Local Government (in our case the Secretary of State for India or, with his previous or subsequent assent, the Governor General of India in Council) may, by general or special order direct or (ii) as the Sessions Judge of the division may make over to him. The question of the Sessions Judge (P.A.) making over the appeal to the Additional Sessions Judge does not arise as the P.A. has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. As for the direction of the Local Government, no general order has ever been made by the Local Government so far; and it may not be convenient for them to majce any special order for the hearing of appeals in these particular cases. 3. Having ootablishod the fact that there will be no a poeaiX ZI ■ 20$ to the Sessions Court in this case, the ozily logical conclusion is that an appeal in such cases shall to the High Court under Section 408 Cr.P.C. i.e. to the P.R.’s Chief Court under Art,14-(1) B*0.C. This conclusion is further strengthened hy proviso (C) to Section 408 Cr.P.Cyoaoording to wh»o-h^whcn a persona is convicted 'by a Magistrate of an offence under Section 124 A of the I.P.C. the appeal shall lie to the High Court. The offence under Section 124A I.P.C. is sedition and as such^offence against the State i It is punishable with (i) transportation for life or any shorter term with or without fine, or (ii) to 3 years*imprisonment with or without fine or (iii) with fine alone. It is triable by the Court of Sessions or (ii-(a) District Magistrate or (ii)-(b) Magistrate of the 1st Class especially empowered (i.e. under Section 30). The offences against Article 4 of the Defence Regulation No.l of 1942 are also offences against the State, are triable District Magistrate especially empowered, and are punishable with 14 years* imprisonment and with deportation As such, they are analogous to the x^^xx offence of sedition; and an appeal from the conviction of these offences should Mutatis Mutandis lie to the High Court like on appeal from the conviction of sedition. 4. In brief, if the case is tried by P.A. as District Magistrate under section 30, the appeal shall lie to the High Court (P.R*c Chief Court in our case) under proviso to Section 408 Cr.P.C. - i.e. either (i) under proviso (b) if the sentence exceeds 4 years* imprisonment or is a sentence of transportation or (ii) under proviso (c) read with S.124A I.P.C. if the sentence is other than thit mentioned under proviso (b). The question of appeal from the order of deportation which may also be passed against the accused in addition to the sentence of imprisonment, does no£ arise as no appeal shall lie fror^ order of deportation under Art.23 (Chapt III) B.O.C. read with Art. 12 of Defence Regulation Ho.* of 1942. ^2 ^ Ho.

The amendments notified hy the Government of Bahrain in their Notice No.50/1362 of September 29th, 1943, and proposed in the Graft amending King’s Regulation No.3 of 1936 appear to go further than was intended and are inconsistent with several Articles which it is not proposed, to amend. ^ • 3 . Article 5 of the Bahrain Government Proclamation of 29th December, 1936, shows that -at the time of framing the Ordinance- the intention was to licence only firearms whereas the present amendments to Articles 6, 7 and 8 either imply’*' or indicate clearly that all arms (which term incfud.es ammunition and. the weapons specified in Article 2/must be licensed.. 4. There appear to be the following defect: drafting of the amendments in the ( i) 'The comma after the word.s arms and the words * 'firearms and ammunition' should have been omitted in Articles 1, 3 and 4. ( ii) Articles 9 and 10 ( whi ch refer ohly to firearms) do not appear to be consistent with the newly amended Articles 6, 7 and 8. As the Ordinance now- stands although all arms must be licensed under Article 7 it is an offence to fail to produce a license for firearms while apparently it is not an offence to fail to produce a license for other arms which are not firearms. (iii) The’comma after the word 'arms' and the words 'firearms or ammunition' in the first sentence of Article 14 of the King’s Regulations should be omitted.. ( iv) In the second sentence of the same Article the word firearms is used. In view of the amended Article 7 of the Ordinance it is possible that the word 'arms' should be substituted for the word 'firearms'. ( v) In Article* 15 of the King’s Regulation the words 'or firearms' should be omitted.

Unlike the King’s Regulations issued under the Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat Orders-in-Council which each have a separate series of serial numbers, the Regulations issued under the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order-in-Oouncil, 1939, though applicable to various territories are in one series.

Will you please examine the Schedule to King’s Regulation No.1 of 1921 and inform me which if any of the Rules and Bye-lav/s recorded therein have now become obsolete. 3. I am asking the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to agree to move His Majesty's Government to approve an amendment to King's Regulation No.l of 1921 to include the Maharraq municipality. It will be necessary for me to be informed at once whether the Manamah municipal rules as now drafted have been applied in toto to the Maharraq municipal area or whether there are certain essential differences and if so what these differences are. 4. Will you please arrange to forward the proclamatinns mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter under reference with the least possible delay. 5. As a temporary measure I am instructing the Agency Courts that where possible Laws and Regulations which have not been correctly applied should be held to fall within the limits of Section 74 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council. This it must be realised is a very unsatisfactory proceeding as there is little doubt that decisions in favour of the Bahrain Government and the municipalities in the case of the Municipal Regulations and the majority of the Bahrain Government's new laws would be reversed on appeal and once that occurs no magistrate or judge when trying subsequent cases would be entitled to disregard such a ruling of the Chief Court.N o. ?

Ro: 3 of 1936). in order to make the amendment to the Arms Ordin ance applicable to foreigners it is necessary that an amend ment to the said King’s Regulation should issue. 2* A King’s Regulation is a Regulation made, not by tne King but, by the Political Resident and allowed, on behalf of the King, by a Secretary of state. The authority under jc whfcch it io made io Article 70 B.O.C. It shall not take eifect until it io allowed by a Secretary of State or, with hio previous or subsequent accent, by the Governor General of India. But, in exceptional and urgent circumstances, it mr,y take eiiect even without such previous allowance (Art 72- (1) B.O.C.). A King’s Regulation differs from an Order in Council in that the latter is ordained by the King’s Most Excellent Majesty in Council while a King’s Regulation is made by the P.R. and allowed by a secretary of State alone. 3 * Now th(jro are main items to be discussed, namely, (i) the Amending Proclamation issued by the Bahrain Govern ment and referred to in para 1 above, ana (ii) Kin g’s Regulatio n to be issued by the P.R. the amending The Arms Ordinance Proclamation to which the amending Proclamation is an amendment, was applied to foreigners in the form of a Schedule annexed to the King’s Regulation. The amending Proclamation should therefore be also made applicable to foreigners in the form of a Schedule (an amend ing .schedule) annexed to the amending King’s Regulation. But the amending Proclamation, as it stands, is not suitably worded for * Schedule.A- Draft Schedule, which is a more fdrma.X ina legal .substitute of the amending Proclamationhas therefore* be«n prepared vn a It may he sent to the Bahrain Government for approval and he annexed to the amending King’s Regulation which has also Been , r^ h King’s Regulation has been prepared on the lines of ” the Bahrain property Law Amending Regulation, 1938(King’s Regulation No: 1 of 1938) and the Draft Schedule on the t lines of the Schedule annexed to the said Regulation. King’s Regulation No: 3 of 1936 ('The possession of aid traffic in Arms Regulation, 1936») has also been followed who re no c e s l ary. Now let us discuss the Draft Schedule, which, as men tioned above, is duly a substitute of the Proclamation, and the Draft amending King’s Regulation separately. Draft/ Schedule The main Acts which the Bahrain Arms Ordinance amending Proclamation prohibits are:- (i) Possession df ammunition without a licence; (ii) sale or purchase of ammunition; and (iii) Import or export of ammunition, besides (iv) applying to ammunition all the orders which apply to firearms. No: (iii) has already been provided for by Art 3 of the existing Arms Ordinance and no further provision for that is necessary. The others provisions of the Proclamation are discussed in the foilowing:- i*- (i): It prohibits possession of ammunition iik i possession of firearms^without a licence, exactly on the lints of Art 7 of the existing Arms Ordinance. Article 14-J^ii^ : The amending Proclamation applies to ammunition ail the orders' 'which apply to Arms under the Arms-y P H Ordinance. But it is neither possible ^odr necessary to apply 'all** such orders to ammunition because, although a large number of them (Articles 5 to 14) have not been applied and are capable of application, there are a few (Articles 3 and 4) which have already been applied and do not call for re-appli cation. In order to apply the provisions of the fomer(Articles 5 to 14) and to exclude the provisions of the latter (Articles fi 3 and 4) the werds in so far as they may be applied' have been added towards the end of Article 14- (ii). Article 15 : The provisions of the amending Proclamation prohibiting the sale and purchase of ammunition have been applied by means of this Article. The sale and purchase of firearms has also been prohibited as the existing Arms Ordinance is deficient in this re spe ct. Articles 14 and 15 of the existing Schedule have been re numbered 16 anti 17 owing to the addition of the two new Articles (14 and 15) after Article 13. 5. Draft King*8 Regulation Article 1 : The Schedule comprising the Bahrain Government Law has not been applied in toto but only with certain modifi cations. The modifications are primarily those which were introduced by Article 1 of King*s Regulation Ho: 3 of 1936 ('The possession of and Traffic in Arms Regulation 1956”) and, also, those which have been necessitated by the addition of the two new Articles in the Schedule (14 and 15). For instance, Article 13 and 14 have been re-numbered 15 and 16 and Articles 15 and 16 have been re-numbered 17 and 18 respectively. 6* May the Draft Schedule be first sent to the Adviser for comments and then, after Bahrain (government f s approval, t© the P.R. along with the draft King’s Regulation.
